The  MTDF \nenvisages  additional  power  generation, \ntransmission,  and \ndistribution  capacities  in  order  to  ensure  sufficient  electricity \nsupply  to  meet  the  projected  8%  per  annum  growth  in  demand \nover  the  planning  period.  The  growth  in  demand  was  about  12% \nin FY2006.  \n \nPower  generation  is  expected  to  grow  from  about  19,540 \nmegawatts (MW) in 2005 to 162,590 MW in 2030. The bulk of the \nadditional  supply  is  expected  to  be  met  through  an  expansion  of \ndomestic  and  imported  thermal  and  hydropower  generation.  The \nGovernment  is  currently  pursuing  a  combination  of  public  and \nprivate  options  to  ensure  new  generation  can  be  added  as \nrequired. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is actively working \nwith the Government and private power generation developers to \nfinance  public-  and  privately-owned  generation  stations  to  meet \nthe current and future demand for electricity. \n \nThis Investment Program focuses on power transmission. In order \nto  facilitate  efficient  and  effective  evacuation  of  power  from \nexisting power stations, the National Transmission and Despatch \nCompany (NTDC), in coordination with the Ministry of Water and \nPower (MOWP), has prepared a Transmission Sector Road Map, \n2007\u20132017. The road map addresses the current shortcomings of \nthe  power  transmission  system  by  recommending  rehabilitation, \naugmentation, and expansion projects and power evacuation from \nthe  planned  power  stations  in  the  least-cost  power  generation \nplan. The total cost of the NTDC investment plan is estimated at \n$3.9  billion.  It  is  envisaged  that  ADB  will  finance  $800  million \n(20%) of the total investment plan. \n \nNTDC was established as part of the unbundling of the Water and \nPower  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  in  1998  to  operate, \nmanage,  and  develop  the  national  power  transmission  network. \nthe \nThe \n\nimmediate  concern  of  NTDC \n\nthe  capacity  of \n\nis \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nSector Investment \nProgram Description \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nrating \n\ntransmission  network  to  evacuate  and  transmit  the  generated \npower to load centers. The 13,051 MW peak demand recorded in \n2006 was constrained by the transmission system and there was \nan  estimated  800  MW  of  unsatisfied  demand.  As  a  result,  some \nlimits, \ntransmission  sections  operated  at  or  above \nincreasing  the  risk  of  transmission  failure  and  costly  service \nrestoration. The inability to transmit all of the available generated \npower has the same effect as a generation shortage and results in \nload shedding to prevent system failure and collapse.  \n \nThe  500  kilovolt  (kV)  system  provides  the  main  power  flow  route \nbetween  the  north  and  the  south  of  Pakistan.    The  bulk  of  the \npower  is  generated  in  the  north  (hydropower)  and  the  south \n(thermal power) with the major load centers being in the middle of \nthe  country  around  Lahore,  Faisalabad,  and  Islamabad.  As  a \nresult  there  are  always  significant  power  flows  from  the  north  or \nthe  south  to  the  centre,  depending  on  the  season  and  the \navailability of hydropower.  At the end of FY2006, 77% of the 500 \nkV and 69% of the 220 kV power transformers were overloaded.  \nThis  means  that  security  of  supply  standards cannot  be  met  and \nNTDC  cannot  meet  its  transmission  license  obligations.  The \nexpertise  of  NTDC  operating  staff  has  prevented  the  situation \nfrom  becoming  worse,  but  there  are  limits  to  what  can  be  done \nwith the system under current stress. \n \nAdditionally,  the  key  load  centers  run  at  a  very  low  power  factor \nand  this,  combined  with  long  transmission  lines,  places  a  very \nhigh  reactive  power  requirement  on  the  power  transmission \nsystem.  The  reactive  power  results  in  a  high  current  flow,  which \ndoes  not  contribute  to  efficient  power  transmission,  reduces  the \neffective \nthe  system,  and/or  causes \ntransmission system voltages to fall below acceptable limits.  \n \nThere are plans to increase power generation, but development of \nthe  transmission  system  has,  to  date,  not  received  sufficient \nattention.    The  planned  increase  in  power  generation  will  strain \nthe  transmission  system  still  further,  and  the  full  benefits  of  the \nextra  power  generation  will  not  be  achieved  without  urgent \ninvestments in the transmission system.  \n \nPlanning and project development capacity is essential for timely \ntransmission \nsystem \nreinforcement  both  lags  behind  and  has  a  longer  lead  time  than \nnew  generation  (e.g.,  gas-fired  generation  plants  can  be \noperational  within  2  years  of  initiation).  This  further  emphasizes \nthe \nthe \nimportance  of  advance  planning  and  accelerating \ntransmission system reinforcement process. \n \nTranche 1 under the Investment Program will have 19 subprojects \nto  augment,  rehabilitate,  and  expand  the  transmission  system. \nThe  subprojects  will  provide  26  transformers,  2  new  substations, \n\ntransfer  capacity  of \n\ntransmission \n\ninvestments \n\nsince \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n(vi)  project  development, \n\n50 km of transmission line and 1 static var compensator. \n \nA  support  component  is  an  integral  part  of  the  proposed \nInvestment  Program.  This  component  will  strengthen  NTDC\u2019s \nproject (i) planning, (ii) design, (iii) implementation, (iv) operations, \nand  (v)  monitoring  capabilities.  The  total  cost  of  the  Investment \nProgram  support  component  is  estimated  at  $10  million  for  the \nduration  of  the  Investment  Program.  The  objective  of  the \ncomponent  is  to  provide  both  resources  and  capacity  to  enable \nNTDC  to  improve  and  expand  its  current  project  preparation, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  capabilities.  Three  streams  of \nactivities will be developed to cover: (i) power transmission project \nimplementation, including general business management, portfolio \nreview,  project  management,  and  program  management; \n(ii) technical operation and maintenance; (iii) accounting, financial \nand  economic  management,  financial  reporting;  (iv)  contracting, \nprocurement  and  inventory  management;  (v)  a  management \ninformation  system  and  economics  of  cost  recovery  and  tariff \nsetting;  and \nincluding  policy \ndevelopment,  a  feasibility  study,  site  identification,  and  project \ndesign. \n \nThe  Government  has  completed  the  legal  unbundling  of  NTDC \nfrom  WAPDA,  and  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory \nAuthority  (NEPRA)  has  determined  a  transmission  tariff  which  is \nsufficient to sustain NTDC operations. During the implementation \nof the Investment Program, further improvements and refinements \nwill be encouraged, and measures will be put in place to minimize \nthe risk of regression. Timely submissions of tariff applications will \nbe  ensured  and  NTDC\u2019s  financial  and  operational  autonomy \nsafeguarded. \n \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide financing through \na  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  for  $800  million  over  10 \nyears,  which  represents  20%  of  the  total  investment  plan  for \n2007\u20132016  of  $3.9  billion.  The  MFF  has  a  maximum  utilization \nperiod of 10 years, and the periodic finance requests (PFRs) will \nbe converted into separate loans. \n \nThe  Government  has  entered \nfinancing \nagreement  (FFA)  with  ADB  for  up  to  $800  million  through \nindividual  loans.  The  draft  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements  of \nADB\u2019s Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities document.  \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  FFA,  the  Government  has  submitted  the \nfirst  PFR  to  ADB  in  an  amount  of  $226  million  from  ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR)  and  in  an  amount  of  $10  million \nequivalent \nfrom  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \nresources. The first PFR for these two loans will be presented to \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors at the same time as this paper and the \nFFA. \n\nframework \n\nin  SDRs \n\ninto  a \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nis  committed \n\nto  developing \n\ntransmission.  This \n\nInvestment  Program  seeks \n\n \nPower is an essential commodity for growth and expansion and in \nturn  for  the  economic  and  social  development  of  Pakistan. \nHistorically,  power  generation  has  received  much  more  attention \nto \nthan \n(i) rehabilitate, augment, and expand parts of the system to meet \ncurrent generation capacities; (ii) expand and augment the system \nto  cope  with  future  power  generation  stations;  and  (iii)  ensure \ncontinued  operation  and  maintenance  in  accordance  with  best \ninternational practices.  \n \nThe  Government \nthe  power \ntransmission system to ensure an adequate and reliable supply of \nelectricity.  \n \nThe Investment Program will finance investments that will support \nsocial  and  economic  prosperity  and  growth.  The  inadequate \nsupply of electricity has become a bottleneck inhibiting economic \ngrowth and affecting all consumer groups and social classes. The \nInvestment  Program  will  address  this  bottleneck,  improve  future \nperformance,  and  increase  efficiency  and  effectiveness  through \ntechnical and other improvements. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  improve  energy  efficiency  and \nprovide institutional capacity for (i) implementation and monitoring \nsupport,  and  (ii)  project  preparatory  activities  for  the  Investment \nProgram\u2019s subprojects and other NTDC undertakings.   \n \n\n2016 is estimated at $3.9 billion. \n \n\nTotal Program \n \nADB \nOther Financiers \nNTDC \nTotal \n\nNTDC Investment Plan \n($ million) \nSubprojects (OCR) \nShare \n   20% \n   50% \n   30% \n100% \n\nAmount \n    790 \n1,959 \n1,165 \n3,914 \n\nProgram Support (ADF) \nAmount \n10.0 \n  0.0 \n  2.5 \n12.5 \n\nShare \n80% \n  0% \n20% \n     100% \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  NTDC  = \nNational  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company,  OCR  =  ordinary  capital \nresources. \nSources: ADB and NTDC estimates. \n\nTranche 1 \n($ million) \n\n \n\nADB \nNTDC \nTotal \n\nAmount \n226 \n  56 \n282 \n\nSubprojects (OCR) \nShare \n   80% \n   20% \n100% \n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  NTDC  = \nNational  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company,  OCR  =  ordinary  capital \nresources. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nProgram Support (ADF) \nAmount \n10.0 \n  2.5 \n12.5 \n\nShare \n  80% \n  20% \n100% \n\n \nNTDC\u2019s Investment Plan   The  total  investment  cost  of  NTDC\u2019s  investment  plan  for  2007\u2013\n\n \nInvestment Program \n \n\n\fMultitranche Financing \nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDisbursement \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nAdvance Contracting \nand Retroactive \nFinancing \n \n\n  v\n\n \nThe  maximum  financing  amount  available  under  the  MFF  is \n$800,000,000.

Individual  consultants \nmay be recruited for specific assignments in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s  procedure. \nthe \nis  envisioned \ncontinuation  of  a  number  of  tasks  during  implementation,  single-\nsource  selection  may  be  used  for  certain  assignments  with  the \nprior approval of ADB. \n \nThe Investment Program is designed to provide all grid-connected \nconsumers  with  an  adequate  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity, \nwhich  would  support  the  Government\u2019s  MTDF  objective  of  8% \nGDP  growth  per  annum.  Substantial  investments  to  rehabilitate, \naugment, and expand the power transmission system will result in \nmore  reliable  supply  to  the  residential,  agricultural,  commercial, \nand industrial consumers within Pakistan. Schools, hospitals, and \nother social services will be among the beneficiaries.  \n \nBy  ensuring  sufficient  investment  in  the  power  transmission \nsystem,  the  Government  will  be  able  to  encourage  the  private \nin  power  generation  stations  and  power \nsector \n\nthat,  because  of \n\ninvest \n\nand \n\nto \n\nIt \n\n\f  vii\n\ndistribution entities. A strong transmission backbone will alleviate \nconcerns about evacuation of electricity and the ability to receive \nuninterrupted  supply.  An  envisaged  increase  in  private  sector \ninvolvement in the overall power sector will be a major benefit of \nthe Investment Program.    \n \nThe  key  assumptions  underlying  the  Investment  Program  are \n(i) macroeconomic  growth  will  remain  stable;  (ii)  federal  and \nprovincial  governments  will  remain  committed  to  power  sector \nreforms and there will be continued progress on policy, regulatory, \nand  institutional  reforms;  and  (iii)  counterpart  funds  will  be \nmobilized in a timely manner. \n \nRisks  to  the  Investment  Program  include:  (i)  delays  in  power \nsector reforms, both in tariff determinations and in notifications of \nthe rates applicable to the distribution companies by NEPRA and \ntariff  determinations  and \nthe  Government; \nnotifications  of  rates  applicable  to  NTDC\u2019s  wheeling  charges  by \nNEPRA  and  the  Government,  to  facilitate  investments  in  power \ntransmission  facilities;  (iii)  an  increase  in  prices  of  cement,  steel, \nfuel, and other raw materials that would affect the financial viability \nof  the  Investment  Program;  (iv)  delays  in  project  implementation \nand  failure  to  secure  the  necessary  clearances  in  time  for \nconstruction; and (iv) failure to mobilize the necessary counterpart \nfunds.  These  risks  all  appear  to  be  low.  NTDC  is  committed  to \nexpanding  power  supply  within  Pakistan \nincreased \ninvestment in the transmission facilities.  \n \n \n\n(ii)  delays \n\nthrough \n\nin \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions

Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Power \nTransmission  Enhancement  Investment  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nSector Overview \n\n2. \nPakistan\u2019s  power  sector  is  faces  tremendous  challenges  in  its  efforts  to  support  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan\u2019s  strategy  of  increasing  the  electricity  supply  to  its  urban  and  rural \npopulation  and  of  securing  overall  economic  growth.  The  key  challenges  are:  (i)  lack  of \ngeneration  capacity,  (ii)  increasing  constraints  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems, \n(iii) weak  financial  management  and  sustainability  of  the  sector  entities,  and  (iv)  inadequate \ncorporate  governance  structures  for  the  successor  companies.  A  detailed  assessment  of  the \npower sector is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nThe  power  sector  will  need  to  increase  its  capacity  to  support  the  target  of  8%  annual \ngrowth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nFramework,  2005\u20132010  (MTDF)  and  to  meet  the  demand  for  and  consumption  of  electricity \nsuch  growth  would  imply.  In  addition,  about  45%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  has  no  access  to \nelectricity  from  the  national  grid  and  the  Government  is  implementing  an  ambitious  plan  to \nsignificantly extend coverage in rural areas. Bottlenecks in the power transmission network are \nexpected to result in significant system capacity shortfalls and to restrict GDP growth by almost \n0.8% in FY2008. \n \n4. \nThe  availability  of  power  is  currently  insufficient  to  meet  peak  system  demand  or  to \nprovide  an  adequate  level  of  spinning  reserve.  Moreover,  existing  transmission  constraints \nmean  that  the  peak  generation  output  cannot  be  delivered  to  distant  load  centers.  If  recent \nincreases  in  demand  continue,  power  shortages  and  customer  disconnections  will  become \nmuch more common unless power transmission is significantly improved as a matter of urgency. \n \n5. \nAccording  to  the  Government\u2019s  power  system  estimates,  at  least  8%  annual  growth  in \nelectricity demand in Pakistan is forecast during 2005\u20132015. Pakistan will require an additional \n2,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  power  annually  to  meet  this  demand  and  this  additional  power  will \nneed to be evacuated through the transmission system. Substantial investments are required to \nstrengthen  the  system  to  (i)  urgently  address  current  shortfalls,  (ii)  evacuate  power  generated \nby additional power plants, and (iii) supply electricity to meet the growing demand.  \n \nThe  currently  installed  generation  capacity  in  Pakistan  is  19,540  MW,  of  which  17,405 \n6. \nMW is in the regions covered by Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). However, \nthe  available  generation  capacity  in  the  WAPDA  regions  is  only  about  13,000  MW  because: \n(i) hydropower plants are dependent upon reservoir capacity and hence are affected by rainfall, \nreservoir  silting,  and  irrigation,  (ii)  the  generation  portfolio  is  ageing  and  subject  to  rating \nlimitations  and  increased  maintenance  requirements,  and  (iii)  the  plants  are  increasingly \nunreliable.  \n\n\f2. \n\nSector Policy and Strategy \n\n7. \nIn  2000,  the  Government  unveiled  a  \u201cVision  2025  Program\u201d,  which  advocated \naccelerated development of new generation facilities. The power policy statement of 2000 was \nsubsequently  revised  in  2002  and  greater  reliance  was  placed  on  indigenous  fuel  sources \n(hydropower  and  thermal  generation)  using  local  coal  or  gas  supplies,  and  renewable \ntechnologies. This power policy embodies the current policy for increasing the country\u2019s power \ngeneration  capacity  and  encompasses  private,  public  and  private\u2013public  models  of  project \nimplementation. The MTDF envisages an ambitious investment program for the power sector in \norder to achieve a consistent 8% annual growth in GDP.   \n \n8. \nTo  support  development  of  the  power  sector  and  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation, the Government has approved power sector policies, strategies, and action plans \nto (i) ensure independent regulation of the power sector; (ii) complete the unbundling of WAPDA \nby establishing four generation and eight distribution companies, and the National Transmission \nand  Despatch  Company  (NTDC);  (iii)  begin  the  power  sector  privatization  program;  and \n(iv) evaluate  and  optimize  the  fuel  sources  of  the  power  sector  to  ensure  energy  security  and \nminimize overall tariff requirements.  \n \n9. \nImplementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector  strategy  would  have  three  main \noutcomes: (i) sector reforms to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and to create an enabling \nenvironment  for  more  private  sector  participation  and  investment,  (ii)  capacity  building  in  all \nsector  organizations,  covering  financial  management,  efficiency  improvement,  the  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism,  and  project  management;  and  (iii) completion  of  large  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects in generation, transmission, and distribution. \n \n\n3. \n\nPerformance of the Power Transmission Sector  \n\nTransmission and distribution losses in the Pakistan power system amounted to 25% in \n10. \n2005.  In  the  transmission  system,  these  high  losses  are  caused  by  the  excess  load  on  the \ntransmission  lines  and  at  substations.  Total  transmission  losses  are  7.5%,  including  the \nsecondary  transmission  system  losses.  The  primary  system  losses  are  more  than  3.0%.  The \nprimary transmission network consists of 4,377 circuit kilometers (km) of 500 kilovolt (kV) lines \nand 6,992 circuit km of 220 kV lines, with nine 500 or 220 kV substations, and 27 substations \ntransforming 220 kV to lower voltages.  \n \nThe 500 kV system provides the main power flow route between the north and the south \n11. \nof Pakistan. The bulk of the generation capacity is connected in the north (hydropower) and the \nsouth (thermal), with the major load center being in the middle of the country, centered around \nFaisalabad,  Islamabad,  and  Lahore.  As  a  result  there  are  always  significant  power  flow \nrequirements from the north and the south to the center, depending on the seasonal availability \nof hydropower. \n \n12. \nNTDC  is  the  sole  transmission  company  in  Pakistan  and  is  licensed  to  operate  the \nprimary transmission system (220 kV and above) and to dispatch all power generation linked to \nthe national grid. Its transmission system links all major generating stations with the main load \ncenters at the 500 kV and 220 kV level. Power is then disbursed through an extensive network \nof 220, 132, and 66 kV lines to the populated areas of the country. The 500 kV system forms a \ncentral spine running over a considerable distance from Tarbella and Peshawar in the north to \nJamshoro and Karachi in the south.  \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f4. \n\nNational Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) \n\nfrom  distribution  companies. 1   Although \n\n13. \nAs  the  sole  transmission  company  in  Pakistan,  NTDC  is  required  to  (i)  maintain  and \nupgrade the current system; (ii) plan, design, and implement system expansion; and (iii) operate \nthe  system  dispatch  generation  according  to  system  requirements  and  transmission  license \nconditions  to  ensure  the  smooth  transmission  of  electricity  from  generation  companies  to \ndistribution  companies  across  the  country.  The  company  took  over  properties,  rights,  assets \nobligations  and  liabilities  of  220  kV  and  500  kV  grid  stations  and  the  transmission  lines  and \nnetwork owned by WAPDA under a business transfer agreement on 1 March 1999.  \n \n14. \nIn  terms  of  human  resources,  the  transition  of  staff  from  WAPDA  to  NTDC  has  been \ncompleted.  The  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  has  also  been  substantially  completed. \nIndependent  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  and  audited,  as  per  its  license,  for \nNTDC\u2019s operations in FY 2004 and 2005. However, its financial independence has yet to reach \nthe  level  required  of  an  autonomous  corporation.  WAPDA  currently  bills  and  collects  the \ntransmission  wheeling  charges \nthe  NEPRA\u2019s \ndetermination  of  the  transmission  tariff  and  the  Government\u2019s  notification  of  the  tariff  enable \nNTDC to charge distribution companies directly, it must make requests for funds to WAPDA for \nmost  of  its  payment  needs.  This  prevents  NTDC  from  achieving  financial  independence  and \nadds procedures and inefficiency to NTDC\u2019s and WAPDA\u2019s financial operations.  \n \n15. \nExternal investment sources will be required to secure an efficient transmission system, \nespecially for the costly evacuation from the new generation plants. Given the current financial \narrangements,  it  will  be  difficult  to  attract  large  amounts  of  investment,  especially  from \ncommercial  sources,  since  NTDC  does  not  control  or  have  access  to  the  cash  flow  from  the \ndistribution companies. NTDC should bill the distribution companies directly and collect charges \nfrom them. The separation of the billing for transmission and power will also prepare NTDC to \ncollect revenues from bulk power consumers when they come into its jurisdiction. \n \n16. \nThe Government has determined that the single buyer function licensed to NTDC will be \nhandled  by  an  independent  agency,  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA).  The \naccumulated loss for the NTDC was PRs14 billion in FY2005 and there are overdue receivables \nfrom  distribution  companies.  The  financial  burden  on  NTDC  has  been  mainly  due  to  its  single \nbuyer  function.  New  licenses  will  have  to  be  issued  to  NTDC  and  the  CPPA.  Tariff \ndeterminations  made  for  the  CPPA  and  agreements  with  generation  companies  and \nindependent power plants (IPPs) have been revised, to reflect the CPPA as the single buyer. As \nan interim measure, the CPPA will be managed separately within NTDC. It will take on most of \nthe  tasks  currently  being  performed  by  WAPDA\u2019s  Private  Power  Organization.  Terms  of \nreference  for  the  management  of  the  independent  CPPA  have  been  drafted.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  requested  to  provide  technical  assistance  for  the \nestablishment of the CPPA. \n  \n\n5. \n\nNTDC Investment Plan  \n\nNTDC\u2019s total investment requirement is estimated to be $3.9 billion in the period to 2016. \n17. \nThe  transmission  investment  plan  covers  68  transformers,  4,415  km  of  lines,  four  static  var \ncompensators  (SVCs),  and  20  new  grid  stations.  The  urgent  and  immediate  transmission \n\n                                                 \n1  NTDC receives payment directly from Karachi Electric Supply Company (KESC) for transmission services. Under \n\ncurrent procedures, even this is transferred to WAPDA for disbursement upon the request of NTDC. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\ffor  2007\u20132011 \n\ntotals  $1.253  billion  (41 \nsystem  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  plan \ntransformers, 402 km of lines, and 4 SVCs). Investments for 2012\u20132016 will mainly facilitate the \nevacuation from new generation plants as per the least-cost power generation plan.  \n \nSubprojects commissioned from 2007 to 2011 will provide capacity to overloaded areas \n18. \nall over Pakistan.  By 2009, 19 subprojects will have been commissioned. 20 transformers will \nhave been installed in existing substations, and six transformers will have been installed in two \nnew substations.  The cost of the subprojects ranges from $4 million to $37 million. SVCs will be \ninstalled within the Lahore ring to improve electricity quality and stability. These investments are \nexpected to add about 3,000 MW of capacity incrementally to the system by 2011. From 2009 to \n2011,  subprojects  will  continue  to  augment  the  system  though  seven  new  substations,  three \nSVCs, and 15 transformers.  By this time it is expected that the environmental and social work \nneeded  to  enable  the  additional  grid  substations\u2019  longer  transmission  lines  (50\u2013200  km)  have \nbeen concluded, allowing a total of 352 km of transmission lines to be added to the network.   \n \n19. \nThe timing of the subprojects to be commissioned from 2012 to 2016 depends largely on \nthe  completion  date  of  the  new  generation  plants.  The  new  plants,  such  as  the  Basha  dam \ndispersal, and the high voltage line linking Karachi and Lahore are due to be completed during \nthis period. The cost estimates of the subprojects to be completed during this period range from \n$40 million to $1.2 billion. \n \n\nTable 1: Total Investment Requirementsa \n\n           \n\nLine \n(km)  Transformers SVC New Substation \n\nAmount  \n($ million)\n    87 \n 197 \n 184 \n 329 \n 487 \n 682 \n 508 \n 612 \n 612 \n 216 \n  3,914 \n                km = kilometer, SVC = static var compensator. \n\n Year \n2006\u20132007 \n2007\u20132008 \n2008\u20132009 \n2009\u20132010 \n2010\u20132011 \n2011\u20132012 \n2012\u20132013 \n2013\u20132014 \n2014\u20132015 \n2015\u20132016 \nTotal \n\n \n     30 \n     20 \n   166 \n   186 \n1,366 \n   347 \n \n \n2,300 \n4,415 \n\n \n21 \n  5 \n13 \n  2 \n18 \n  6 \n \n \n  3 \n68 \n\n \n \n \n1 \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n2 \n5 \n2 \n8 \n3 \n \n \n \n20 \n\n  a Components have been included in the year commissioned and investment amount    \n     according to disbursement each year. \nSource: NTDC estimates. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges of the Power Transmission Sector  \n\n20. \nPakistan\u2019s power transmission system faces three major challenges: (i) the heavy power \nflow through the 500 kV system, (ii) a shortage of supply capacity for the 220 kV system, and \n(iii)  high  transmission  losses.  The  system  is  unable  to  meet  the  current  peak  demand,  and  is \nalready  falling  behind  the  generation  expansion  targets.  To  enable  the  increased  generating \ncapacity to support the Government\u2019s growth targets, the power transmission system must (i) be \nstrengthened to meet current system requirements and fulfill peak demand, and (ii) keep pace \nwith the commissioning of new generation plants. \n \n\n4 \n\n     \nB. \n\n \n\n\fThe  transmission  system  is  aging,  overloaded,  and  poorly  maintained.  It  is  unreliable, \n21. \nand  at  times  there  is  a  risk  of  collapse.  The  system  needs  immediate  rehabilitation, \naugmentation,  and  expansion  so  it  can  meet  consumer  demands  and  system  security \nrequirements. Ensuring the safe and reliable transmission of electricity will be a major challenge \nfor Pakistan.  \n \n22. \nThe mismatch between the location of demand and the source of supply in the existing \npower  system  means  that  investments  will  have  to  be  made  in  the  primary  network.  Current \npeak  energy  and  capacity  shortfalls  are  to  some  extent  the  consequence  of  shortages  and \nbottlenecks  in  the  national  network.  Primary  network  constraints  cause  inefficiencies  for \nconsumers,  such  as  high  levels  of  un-served  energy  or  investment  in  costly  self-  or  captive \ngeneration,  at  a  significant  cost.  Export  competitiveness,  for  example,  of  the  textile  sector,  is \neroded  by  high  electricity  costs  and  unreliable  power  supplies.  Meanwhile,  demand  growth  is \nforecast to continue unabated.  \n \n23. \nThe  immediate  concern  is  the  capacity  of  the  power  transmission  network  to  evacuate \nand  transmit  the  present  output  to  load  centers.  The  record  maximum  transmission  system \ndemand in the summer of 2006 was 13,051 MW, representing the system at full capacity. It has \nbeen  estimated  at  that  time  there  was  800  MW  of  unsatisfied  demand  due  to  load  shedding. \nEven  with  this  constrained  demand,  sections  of  the  transmission  network  are  running \nperiodically  above  rating  limits,  thereby  increasing  further  the  risk  of  lengthy  transmission \noutages.  \n \n24. \nThis  load  shedding  figure  does  not  include  the  load  shed  due  to  under-frequency  and \nlow voltage. The gap between generation supply and demand at present and in the near future \nindicates  that  the  primary  system  is  heavily  stressed  and  in  urgent  need  of  additional \ninvestment, even at current levels of demand. About 77% of 500 kV and 69% of 220 kV power \ntransformers were overloaded in 2006. About 24% of 500 kV and 20% of 220 kV transformers \nwere  more  than  80%  overloaded.  Further  additions  to  the  system  are  required  in  order  to \nachieve the obligatory reliability standards and to improve the quality of supply significantly.  \n \n25. \nAlthough power generation plans are moving forward, development of the transmission \nsystem  has,  to  date,  not  received  sufficient  attention.  The  planned  increase  in  generation \ncapacity  will  further  exacerbate  the  transmission  constraints,  and  the  full  benefits  of  the  extra \ngeneration will not be achieved unless there is urgent investment in the transmission system. \n \nThe  Government  is  taking  steps  to  address  the  situation  and  has  approved  a  power \n26. \ntransmission  sector  road  map,  a  comprehensive  government  plan  that  specifies  the  details  of \nsystem renovation and expansion. The objective of the road map is to show how a reliable and \nhigh-quality power supply can meet rising demand from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and \ndomestic  customers.  The  road  map  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy  that  aims  to  increase  the  level  of  economic  activity  and  to  achieve  the  following \noutcomes:  (i)  a  more  efficient  power  system;  (ii)  high-quality  power  supply  through  a  more \nreliable  and  stable  system;  (iii)  greater  geographic  coverage  of  power  supply;  and  (iv) greater \naccess to affordable electricity, by bringing hydroelectric and coal-fired thermal energy to load \ncenters. The NTDC investment plan for 2007\u20132016 is shown in Appendix 3. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Issues  \n\n27. \nThe  financial  health  and  sustainability  of  the  power  sector  is  dependent  on  timely  and \naccurate (i) submission of tariff applications by the distribution companies; (ii) execution of the \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ftariff  determination  by  NEPRA;  (iii)  notification  of  the  tariff  determination  by  the  Government; \n(iv) metering,  billing,  and  collection  by  the  distribution  companies;  (v)  payment  of  subsidy \nallocations  by  the  Government;  (vi)  payment  from  distribution  companies  to  NTDC  for \ntransmission charges; and (vii) settlement of purchases and sale of electricity by the CPPA.  \n \n28. \nThe  unbundling  of  the  power  sector  has  been  in  progress  since  1999.  To  achieve  the \nefficiencies and transparency that were intended by the unbundling, financial and management \nindependence  is  necessary.  Although  the  NTDC  continues  to  be  financially  dependent  on \nWAPDA,  it  has  satisfactory  accounting  systems  and  external  audit  processes  that  are  in \naccordance  with  international  audit  standards.  It  is  developing  in-house  payment,  billing,  and \ncollection  systems.  Accordingly,  these  functions  can  safely  be  transferred  to  NTDC.  ADB  is \ncurrently providing technical assistance 2 (TA) to strengthen NTDC capacities. As an immediate \nstep, WAPDA is expected to provide monthly payments to NTDC for transmission charges.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Matters \n\nAs the transition period is coming to an end and NTDC has built capacity to enable its \n29. \nindependence  from  WAPDA,  the  corporate  governance  structure  of  its  board  needs  to  be  in \naccordance with best international practice. Currently, the board consists of a chairman, three \nmembers from the private sector, and three officials representing the owner, the Government of \nPakistan.  The  nomination  of  the  board  members  is  made  by  chairman  of  Pakistan  Electric \nPower Company (PEPCO) in accordance with a presidential directive.  The chairman of NTDC \nand  another  director  concurrently  hold  seats  in  WAPDA,  PEPCO,  and  the  NTDC.  A  situation \nwhere the same individual holds many positions on boards of directors is counterproductive to \nthe  Government\u2019s  power  sector  policy.  When  the  NTDC  becomes  fully  independent,  there  will \nbe a conflict of interest if an NTDC board member also sits on the board of WAPDA or another \ncompany  that  holds  generation  assets.  Such  conflicts  of  interest  would  make  it  difficult  for \nindividuals to exercise their fiduciary duties and carry out their oversight role. \n \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n30. \nThe  Government  is  acutely  aware  of  the  need  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \nsector. In 2002, it set out a policy for power generation projects, which provided a clear set of \nincentives,  along  with  a  regulatory  regime,  to  attract  private  capital.  Pakistan  has  been \nsuccessful in attracting private sector investment and is working to further improve the enabling \nenvironment.3 The 15 commissioned IPPs make up about 4,000 MW of generating capacity.   \n  \n31. \nIn  line  with  overall  power  sector  policies,  the  power  transmission  subsectors  promotes \nprivate  sector  economic  activities  by  making  available  power  through  evacuation  of  electricity  \nfrom    the  IPPs,  after  approval  of  the  IPPs  by  the  Government  has  been  obtained.  A  robust \ntransmission  system  is  the  anchor  for  private  sector  investments  in  power  generation  facilities \nand power distribution companies. Through substantial investments in the transmission system, \nthe  Government  will  be  able  to  establish  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  private  sector \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2005.

Manila. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\finvestments. At the same time it will remove concerns about the ability to evacuate power from \nIPPs  and  ensure  a  continuous  supply  of  power  to  the  distribution  companies.  The  power \ntransmission investment program and the policies of the Private Power and Infrastructure Board \n(PPIB)  specify  role  of  NTDC  in  public\u2013private  partnerships.  These  include  (i) the  design  of \npower  evacuation  facilities  from  approved  IPPs,  (ii)  a  clear  definition  of  power  transmission \nfinancing mechanisms for IPPs, and (iii) an assurance that transmission lines for evacuation of \nelectricity from IPPs will be built on time. Through this MFF, ADB will help the Government to \npromote public\u2013private partnerships in the power sector, by (i) making further improvements to \nfor  power  evacuation  using  public\u2013private  partnerships,  and \nthe  enabling  conditions \n(ii) providing  financial  security  for  the  funding  of  power  transmission  facilities  dedicated  to  the \nevacuation of electricity from IPPs. \n \nThere  have  been  two  attempts  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  the  power \n32. \ntransmission  subsector  since  the  Government  adopted  its  Transmission  Line  Policy  in  1995.  \nAlthough  bidding  for  the  projects  was  successful,  neither  attempt  achieved  financial  closure.  \nTaking  the  lessons  learned  from  these  projects,  private  sector  participation  will  be  actively \nsought for the larger subprojects. There is track record for transmission tariff determination and \nincentives  given  by  government.    Some  of  the  subprojects  in  the  Investment  Program  are  for \nevacuation of IPPs.   \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n33. \nThe major sources of external assistance to the power sector are ADB, the Government \nof  Japan,  and  the  World  Bank.  Together  they  provide  more  than  half  of  the  official  external \nassistance. ADB has supported both Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) and the Water \nand  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA),  while  the  World  Bank  has  mainly  provided \nassistance to WAPDA. Pakistan\u2019s development partners have been working together to evolve \na strategy for the privatization of the power sector. ADB, the World Bank, and the Government \nhave prepared a policy matrix, with a clear delineation of the division of labor between ADB and \nthe World Bank.  \n\n34. \nBilateral  Support.  The  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  has \nsupported WAPDA to rehabilitate the Warsak Hydroelectric Power Station. It has also provided \nassistance  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources  to \ndevelop and implement sound policies and regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector \ninvestment  and  to  enforce  effective  conservation  and  environmental  regulations.  CIDA  also \nsupports public and private companies to develop and manage hydrocarbon resources. \n \n35. \nThe Government of Germany is supporting a hydropower promotion program and a grid \nstation  in  Ghakkar  for  power  transmission  from  Ghazi-Barotha.  The  Government  of  Japan  is \nconsidering assistance for energy efficiency enhancement through improvements to the national \ngrid, the load dispatch system, and area-specific electrification. \n \n36.  World  Bank.  The  focus  of  the  World  Bank  is  on  ensuring  a  competitive  and  efficient \npower  sector  that  provides  affordable  electric  power;  increasing  access  to  electricity  in  rural \nareas; putting in place efficient and competitive oil, gas and petroleum industries supported by \neffective  government  regulation;  and  increasing  exploration  of  mineral  resources  under  a \nmodernized institutional, legal, and regulatory framework. It also carries out analytical work on \ngovernance  and  tariff  issues,  sector  dialogue,  subsidy  policy  for  the  oil  and  gas  sectors,  and \npolicy dialogue on the mineral sector. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP). UNDP provides assistance for an \n37. \nenergy-efficiency  project  in  the  transport  sector.  It  provides  support  for  promoting  renewable \nenergy technologies and energy-efficient housing with a view to disseminating success stories \nin such areas as energy conservation and renewable technology, training of women in energy-\nefficient use of home appliances, and liquefied petroleum gas promotion in the Northern Areas. \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons  \n\nTen ADB-financed power projects approved before 1983 have been post-evaluated. All \n38. \nwere  classified  as  generally  successful.  The  post-evaluation  findings  showed  an  average \nimplementation  delay  of  2.4  years  (78%).  Five  of  the  projects  experienced  an  average  cost \noverrun  of  about  82%,  and  the  other  five  an  under-run  of  28%.  The  post-evaluations  drew \nattention  to  the  need  for  an  in-depth  analysis  of  all  technical  issues  before  a  project  is \nformulated,  and  the  need  to  review  cost  estimates  comprehensively  at  appraisal.  The \nperformance of ADB-financed projects after 1983 has improved. However, KESC and WAPDA \nhave  been  unable  to  meet  the  system  loss  targets,  and  accordingly  have  not  been  able  to \ncomply with the financial covenants.  ADB loans are listed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n39. \nTariff  adjustments  have  been  based  on  social  equity  and  affordability  considerations, \nwhich has led to a lack of commercial focus and inhibited KESC and WAPDA from generating \nenough funds to meet all expansion, rehabilitation, and reinforcement requirements. The utilities \nhave lacked focused leadership, good management practices, and transparency in operational \nand  financial  matters.  Most  ADB-financed  projects  have  been  sector  loans.  This  allows \nconsiderable flexibility in selection of subprojects, and in the use of consultants for formulating \nthe  subprojects.  As  a  result,  cost  overruns  have  been  greatly  reduced.  However,  slow  project \nimplementation  remains  a  problem.  Delays  have  been  caused  by  slow  procurement  of \nconsultants  and  goods,  bureaucratic  procedures,  organizational  and  institutional  weaknesses, \nchanges in project scope, and shortages of qualified staff.  \n \n40. \nLessons  learned  from  previous  projects  are  reflected  in  three  specific  measures  in  the \nInvestment  Program:  (i)  in-depth  preparation  of  the  subprojects  included  in  each  tranche, \n(ii) early  action  on  procurement  and  consulting  services,  and  (iii)  measurable  milestones  and \nclose  implementation  facilitation  and  supervision.  To  ensure  quality  at  entry,  each  subproject \nhas  been  evaluated  using \n(iii) economic; \n(iv) environmental  assessment;  and  (v) social  assessment,  including  land  acquisition  and, \nwhere necessary, a resettlement plan. Such early attention to procurement will ensure that bid \ndocument  preparation  and  review  procedures  do  not  lead  to  delays.  Close  follow-up  during \nmanufacturing  of  goods,  construction  of  civil  works,  and  installation  should  ensure  timely \ncorrective measures where needed and an early completion of each subproject.     \n \n\nfive  criteria: \n\ntechnical; \n\nfinancial; \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n7. \n\nADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n\n41. \nADB Operations. Since the start of ADB operations in Pakistan in 1968, total lending to \nthe energy sector has amounted to about $3 billion, of which $2.4 billion has been to the power \nsubsector  and  $0.6  billion  to  the  natural  gas  and  petroleum  subsectors.  During  recent  years, \nADB\u2019s overall lending to the energy sector has accounted for about 28% of its total lending to \nPakistan. About 67% of the lending to the power subsector ($1.6 billion for 13 loans) has been \nprovided  to  WAPDA  and  the  rest  to  KESC.  ADB  has  been  the  major  source  of  external \nassistance  to  the  energy  sector  in  Pakistan,  having  provided  about  one-third  of  total  external \nresources.  ADB\u2019s  nonlending  activities  in  the  sector  have  also  been  important,  with  a  total  of \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f$14.2  million  provided  for  27  TA  projects.  ADB  TA  projects  are  listed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n \n42. \nSector  Portfolio  Description.  The  energy  sector  portfolio  currently  has  no  loans  and \nseven  ongoing  TA  projects,  amounting  to  $3.95  million.  Of  the  seven  TA  projects,  five  are \noperational  while  two  are  in  the  process  of  becoming  operational  and  will  field  consultants  in \n2006.  The  main  areas  covered  include  tariff  rationalization  and  integration,  management \ninformation  systems,  power  generation  coordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance, \ninstitutional strengthening and restructuring, and privatization.  \n \n43. \nKey  Sector  Portfolio  Concerns.  TA  implementation  performance  is  generally  in  line \nwith  Pakistan  and  ADB-wide  averages.  The  country  operational  framework  emphasizes  the \nneed  to  strengthen  governance  and  improve  on  portfolio  performance,  both  of  which  are \nimportant in the energy sector. \n \n44. \nADB Strategy. The energy sector in Pakistan needs to grow by 12% annually to sustain \nthe envisaged GDP growth rate of 8% a year. The immediate demand for significant additional \npower will result in power shortages beginning in 2006\u20132007 and a shortfall of about 5,500 MW \nby 2009\u20132010, if no new investment takes place. ADB\u2019s finance in the short- and medium-term \nwill  prioritize  assistance  for  economic  infrastructure  projects  that  address  critical  gaps  and \nconstraints in the over-stressed transmission and distribution systems and that rehabilitate and \nmodernize  the  power  infrastructure.  However,  investment  in  additional  generation  is  only \njustifiable  if  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  can  handle  the  additional  load.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  to  the  energy  sector  also  prioritizes  power  sector  reform  and  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.  \n \n45. \nReforms to create an enabling environment for future public sector investment projects \nand  to  promote  private  sector  participation  have  been  made  over  the  past  5  years.  However, \nseveral challenges remain, and the sector continues to face high technical and financial losses, \ndependence  on  subsidies,  overstaffing,  and  service  deterioration.  In  the  short  term,  ADB  is \nhelping  the  Government  conduct  sector  analysis,  capacity  building  and  project  identification, \ndevelopment, and implementation. Over the medium term, ADB will support larger infrastructure \ndevelopment projects in renewable energy, power transmission and distribution.  \n \n46. \nThe  Government  has  also  been  discussing  possible  technical  assistance  with  ADB. \nSupport for integrated energy modeling and planning capacity, energy subsector infrastructure \ndevelopment  master  plans,  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  to  promote  public\u2013private \npartnership  (particularly  the  independent  power  plants),  and  evaluation  of  opportunities  for \nenergy cooperation in the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation region are all under \nconsideration.  The  Government  is  also  likely  to  request  ADB  assistance  for  hydroelectric  and \nwater storage projects, energy (power, gas and liquefied natural gas) imports from Central Asia, \nand coastal oil refinery and petrochemical projects.    \n \n47. \nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  recommends  careful  prioritization  of  new  public  sector \ninvestments, with an emphasis on creating a favorable environment for privatization and private \nsector  involvement.  Priority  areas  include  (i)  increasing  energy  efficiency  (both  supply  and \ndemand); (ii) optimizing hydropower and support for public\u2013private partnerships in hydropower \ngeneration;  (iii)  balanced  energy  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv)   sector \nrestructuring, rationalization of tariffs, and greater private sector participation.  \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe proposed Investment Program is closely linked to Pakistan\u2019s long-term power sector \n48. \nstrategy  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  power  transmission  development  program.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  enhance  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  power  transmission  system  and \nprovide  an  adequate  and  reliable  power  supply  to  a  greater  number  of  industrial,  commercial \nand residential consumers. The power sector is a key infrastructure area for economic growth \nand  development,  and  the  Investment  Program  will  be  a  vital  way  of  supporting  power  sector \ndevelopment and economic growth in Pakistan. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nthe  proposed \n\nThe  subprojects  under \n\nInvestment  Program  will \n\n49. \nimprove  power \ntransmission  infrastructure  through  rehabilitation,  augmentation  and  expansion  of  the  primary \n(above  220  kV)  transmission  network,  and  relieve  the  power  system  from  transmission \nbottlenecks. Specifically, (i) NTDC will adhere to its transmission license conditions and comply \nwith  the  grid  security  code,  (ii)  about  10.5  gigawatt  hours  (GWh)  of  additional  power  will  be \nsupplied  through  the  national  grid  annually,  (iii)  the  system  will  be  capable  of  meeting  peak \ndemand, with electricity outages significantly reduced; and (iv) 70 million additional people will \nhave access to electricity from the national grid. \n \n50. \nThe Investment Program has two components. First, it will finance subprojects that are \npart of NTDC\u2019s investment plan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), through individual \nloans for each tranche. Second, it will finance an investment program support component from \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) resources, through a separate loan.  \n \nC. \n\nTechnical Justification and Selection Criteria \n\n51. \nThe  projects  under  the  proposed  Investment  Program  cover  the  whole  country.  The \nInvestment  Program  is  divided  into  tranches,  with  tranche  1  covering  19  subprojects  and  the \ninvestment  program  support  component  (Appendix  6).  These  subprojects  are  urgently  needed \nfor the system to meet the system safety and security requirements. The following criteria were \nused  to  identify  the  subprojects:  (i)  technical  justification,  (ii)  financial  and  economic  viability, \nand (iii) minimal residual environmental and social impacts.  \n \n52. \nEach  subproject  was  tested  for  financial  and  economic  viability,  and  assessed  for \nenvironmental  or  social  impact.  Load  flow  studies  by  NTDC  tested  the  technical  merits  of \nsubprojects and the results were verified by ADB. Most of the subprojects (15) in tranche 1 are \nadditions or improvements to transformers within existing substations. Two subprojects contain \na  new  substation,  with  an  associated  transmission  line  and  power  transformers,  and  one \ninvolves construction of a transmission line. A static var compensator (SVC) will be installed at \nan existing grid substation in tranche 1.  \n \n53. \nThe  requirements  for  justification  will  apply  to  all  subprojects  in  the  future  tranches. \nNTDC  is  required  under  its  license  to  meet  the  security  standards  governing  planning  and \noperation  of  the  transmission  system.  However,  it  is  finding  it  difficult  to  meet  some  of  these \nstandards,  which  could  result  in  a  breach  of  the  license  under  peak  conditions.  The \nreinforcements planned in tranches 1 and 2 will enable the security standards to be satisfied:  \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n15  subprojects  will  add  transformers,  as  existing  transformers  are  overloaded \nand the N-1 criteria is violated; \nthe  two  new  substations  will  help  to  relieve  the  existing  substation,  which  is \noverloaded under peak conditions; \nthe  Tarbela\u2013Mardan  220  kV  double-circuit  transmission  line  will  relieve  the \noverloading of the circuit, thus meeting the N-1 criteria; and \nthe  installation  of  the  SVCs  will  help  to  reduce  the  voltage  instability  with  the \npotential for cascade tripping and subsequent system collapse. \n\n \nD. \n\nSubproject Preparation, Implementation, and Monitoring Capabilities \n\n54. \nNTDC\u2019s  experience  in  all  technical  aspects  of  power  transmission  is  satisfactory. \nHowever,  training  in  modern  transmission  planning  and  utility  management,  as  well  as  in \ninformation  and  communications  technology,  is  needed  to  bring  NTDC  up  to  date.  The \ninvestment program support component will strengthen NTDC\u2019s project management, planning, \nimplementation  and  operation,  maintenance,  environmental  assessment,  and \ndesign, \nimprove  NTDC\u2019s  subproject \nmanagement  (Appendix  4).  The  support  component  will \nimplementation  and  project  preparation.  Bilateral  exchange  programs  with  foreign  power \ntransmission companies within and outside the region will develop role models among current \nand potential managers.  \n \n55. \nThe investment program support component will help NTDC to prepare subprojects for \ntranche  3  onwards.  It  will  also  provide  funding  for  the  preparatory  activities  related  to  power \nevacuation  from  the  imported  coal  generation  project  proposed  for  the  Karachi  area.  The \nobjective  is  to  establish  resources  and  capacity  in  NTDC  to  enable  it  to  expand  subproject \npreparation and implementation. Three streams of activities will be developed to  cover (i) power \ntransmission  subproject  implementation,  including  general  business  management,  portfolio \nreview,  project  management,  and  program  management;  (ii) \ntechnical  operation  and \nmaintenance;  (iii) accounting,  financial  and  economic  management,  and  financial  reporting; \n(iv) contracting, procurement, and inventory management, (v) management information system \nand economics of cost recovery and tariff setting; and (vi) project development, including policy \ndevelopment, feasibility studies, site identification, and project design. \n \nE. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n56. \nThe total cost of the NTDC investment plan is $3.9 billion equivalent. The financing plan \nis  a  combination  of  funds  from  NTDC,  ADB,  and  other  financiers  (Appendix  5).  It  was  agreed \nthat NTDC would provide at least 20% from its own resources and that ADB could fund up to \n80% of the total amount for each tranche. \n \n\nTotal Program \n \nADB \nOther Financiers \nNTDC \nTotal \n\nTable 2: NTDC Investment Plan \n($ million) \nSubprojects (OCR) \nShare \n 20% \n 50% \n 30% \n100% \n\nAmount \n   790 \n1,959 \n1,165 \n3,914 \n\nProgram Support (ADF) \nAmount \n10.0 \n  0.0 \n  2.5 \n12.5 \n\nShare \n80% \n  0% \n20% \n     100% \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  NTDC  = \nNational Transmission and Despatch Company, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fThe  Government  has  requested  financing  up  to  the  equivalent  of  $800  million  to  help \n57. \nfinance  part  of  the  NTDC  investment  plan.  The  financing  will  be  provided  under  an  MFF,  in \naccordance with ADB policy.4  The implementation period will be 10 years. The MFF will consist \nof  individual  loans,  subject  to  the  submission  of  a  related  PFR  by  the  Government  and \nexecution  of  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The  Government  has  entered  into  a  framework \nfinancing agreement (FFA) with ADB. The FFA satisfies the requirements set forth in Appendix \n4  of  the  ADB  policy  (footnote  4).  The  loans  under  the  MFF  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment \nand  goods,  and  consulting  services.  The  Government  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  loans \navailable to NTDC upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.   \n \n58. \nADB will use its OCR to finance the subprojects for a maximum amount of $790 million. \nAll of the provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to a London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based loan5 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may \nbe  included  under  individual  Loan Agreements.  Each  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  20 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%, 6  \nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the FFA and the Loan \nRegulations,  and  such  other  terms  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The \nforeign  risk  will  be  borne  by  the  Borrower.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made relying on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n59. \nThe investment program support component, amounting to $10 million, will be funded by \nADB through its ADF resources. The Borrower will make the proceeds of the loan available to \nNTDC upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the \nterms and conditions will include interest at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period, \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8  years.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  the  Borrower.  The  investment  program \nsupport component will include all environmental and social safeguard aspects.  Projects will be \nprepared  to  attract  and  maximize  investment  from  the  private  sector  and  from  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  financiers  for  the  sizable  subprojects  needed  in  the  later  years  of  the  investment \nplan.    \n \n60. \nThe  Government  has  submitted  to  ADB  the  first  PFR  for  tranche  1,  requesting \n$226 million to finance 19 subprojects from ADB\u2019s OCR resources and $10 million to finance the \ninvestment program support component from ADB\u2019s ADF resources. The first PFR is presented \nto  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  together  with  this  document  and  the  FFA.  The  cost  of  the  19 \nsubprojects  identified  under  tranche  1  is  estimated  at  2006  current  prices  to  be  $282  million. \nThe Government and NTDC requested ADB to finance up to 80% of the total cost, amounting to \n$226 million. The remaining portion will be met by NTDC\u2019s internally generated funds. The cost \nestimates per subproject are provided in Appendix 6. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished. The PMU manager will have been identified by the time of the Appraisal Mission. \nThe  PMU  manager  will  report  all  subproject  related  matters  to  the  general  manager  of  the \nplanning  department.  Once \ninternal \ngovernment  approval  for  loan  projects,  (which  will  be  developed  by  NTDC  in  a  timely  manner \nand submitted to the Government) has been approved by the Government, the PMU staff will be \nappointed. \n \n63. \nhave  already  been  assigned  to  carry  out  preparatory  works,  including  (i)  identification  and   \npreparation of subprojects, (ii) preparation and obtaining approval for the PC-1 from the federal \ngovernment,  (iii)  assessment  and  approval  for  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and \nresettlement  plans  by  the  provincial  governments,  and  (iv)  advance  actions  in  procurement \nmatters and recruiting consultants. The chief executive of NTDC has given a commitment that \nthe PMU will have been officially established by 15 November 2006.  \n \n64. \nThe subprojects will be implemented as per NTDC specifications. Relevant international \npractices  and  standards  will  be  adhered  to.  Detailed  construction  and  installation  layout  and \ndrawings will be available for each subproject and will be in line with erection, construction, and \ncommissioning  procedures  as  per  NTDC  standards  and  as  specified  in  specifications  and \ncontracts. Environmental assessments will be carried out for each subproject in line with (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  review  of  IEEs  and  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  regulations  2000,  and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nenvironment  guidelines  (2003).  All  subprojects  will  need  to  be  submitted  for  approval  to  the \nprovincial EPA (P-EPA). The Punjab EPA has indicated that, although all grid substations and \n11 kV transmission projects require environmental assessment under statutory provisions, this \nprocess  need  not  be  onerous  and,  providing  all  the  subprojects  are  disclosed,  the  P-EPA  will \nfacilitate  the  environmental  assessment  approval  process.  A  full  EIA  may  not  be  required. \nNTDC  will follow ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development  during the implementation of each \nsubproject.  NTDC  will  also  monitor  the  effects  of  individual  subprojects  on  women  during \nimplementation.  NTDC  will  further  ensure  that  all  bidding  processes  are  handled  in  a \ntransparent  manner  and  follow  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  in  this  regard.  All  resettlement  issues  will  be \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fdealt  with  within  the  resettlement  framework  and  the  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  each \nsubproject.  NTDC  will  adhere  to  this  during  implementation.  NTDC  will  also  follow  the \nenvironmental assessment review framework, which was agreed with ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Program Management \n\n65. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  follow  MFF  implementation  procedures.  NTDC  will \nappraise  all  subprojects  and  be  responsible  for  processing  and  implementing  them.  The \nappraisal,  processing,  and  implementation  will  cover  the  development  and  completion  of \ntechnical  reports  (feasibility  studies,  preliminary  design  reports,  environmental  assessment \nreports, resettlement and indigenous people\u2019s development plans, and detailed design reports) \nto ensure compliance with Government and ADB requirements. PFRs will be submitted to ADB \nwhen  they  have  been  approved  by  NTDC  and  have  received  the  required  government \nclearances (PC-1s). \n  \n66. \nNTDC  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  every  quarter.  Rapid \nenvironmental  assessment  checklists  will  be  completed  as  an  early  warning  system  for \nsubprojects that are environmental or social category A or B-sensitive. NTDC will submit other \nrequired  performance  and  monitoring  reports  twice  a  year.  Overall  progress  and  compliance \nwith  conditions  of  the  FFA  and  individual  loan  and  project  agreements  will  be  monitored \nregularly  with  periodic  reports  to  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation \nrequirements.  Reports  will  include  evaluation  of  issues  or  problems  faced  by  NTDC  and \nrecommended  remedial  actions.  Overall  investment  progress  will  be  considered  as  new \nfinancing requests are submitted.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n67. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  over  10  years,  inclusive  of  procurement \nand construction activities, from 2007 to 2016 (Appendix 7). The loan agreements are expected \nto have implementation periods of 3\u20136 years. The last PFR should be submitted no later than 31 \nDecember 2014.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n68. \nProcurement of goods and services to be financed under the Investment Program will be \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006) and will be in line with \nADB\u2019s  policy  on  environmentally  responsible  procurement.  International  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  will  be  used  for  the  supply  of  goods  and  works  being  funded  under  the  Investment \nProgram. ICB will be used for supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or \nmore.  ICB  will  be  used  for  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $5  million  or \nmore.  A  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  there  is  maximum  competition  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  The  detailed  thresholds  of  each  procurement  method  are \ndefined in Appendix 8. In accordance with the above arrangements, the tentative procurement \npackages for the subprojects under tranche 1 are also presented in Appendix 8.  \n \n69. \nConsulting services will be required for (i) preparation of subprojects, (ii) detailed design, \nand  (iii)  construction  supervision  and  contract  management.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006). Firms carrying \nout consulting services will be selected through international competition using the quality- and \ncost-based selection  method.  Individual  consultants  may  be  recruited  for  specific  assignments \nin accordance with the Government procedures acceptable to ADB. Because a number of tasks \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fmay  continue  over  the  course  of  implementation,  it  is  envisioned  that  single-source  selection \nmay be used for some assignments with the prior approval of ADB. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n70. \nThe  individual  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (covering  both  ADF  and  OCR  resources)  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim \nGuidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products, both as amended from \ntime to time.   \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nBecause of the urgent nature of the subprojects, NTDC has requested ADB\u2019s approval \n71. \nto  carry  out  advance  contracting  for  procurement  of  works  and  goods  for  each  tranche.  The \nGovernment has also requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount for each \ntranche  under  the  Investment  Program.  NTDC  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advanced \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  of  the  proposed \nsubprojects.  \n \n72. \nADB Management has approved the request for advanced contracting for procurement \nof works and goods. It has also agreed to seek Board approval for retroactive financing for the \nfirst and subsequent tranches (up to 20% of the proceeds from individual loans under the MFF) \nprovided that expenditures are in accordance with agreed procedures and that they took place \nduring  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement  and \nloan  effectiveness  under  the  MFF,  subject  to  Management\u2019s  specific  approval  of  retroactive \nfinancing  on  a  per-tranche  basis.  Retroactive  financing  is  sought  for  eligible  expenditures \nincluding  civil  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services.  Such  financing  will  be  subject  to \ncompliance with involuntary resettlement requirements stated in subproject resettlement plan. \n  \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n7. \n \n73. \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nNTDC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprojects  under  the  Investment \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are \nincluded  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment  Program.  In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Investment  Program  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nNTDC, and all contractors, suppliers, and consultants and other service providers as they relate \nto the Investment Program. \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n8. \n \nQuarterly  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  for  the  individual  subprojects  for  review  by \n74. \nADB.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  physical  progress,  problems,  and  difficulties \nencountered and a summary of financial accounts that will consist of loan expenditures during \nthe period, during the year to date, and the total to date. Progress on environmental and social \ncompliance  will  be  included.  A  subproject  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months \nfollowing  completion  of  each  subproject.  NTDC  will  maintain  separate accounts  for  each  loan. \nWithin 6 months of the close of each fiscal year, NTDC will submit audited subproject accounts \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fand  financial  statements  to  ADB.  An  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  hired  by \nNTDC to conduct the audit. \n \n75. \nNTDC  inherited  an  internal  audit  system  from  WAPDA.    The  system  provides  for  the \ninternal  audit  to  be  involved  in  the  procurement  and  disposal  process  as  well  as  to  perform \nannual  audits.  In  addition,  NTDC  has  established  an  audit  committee  with  an  external \nprofessional  chairman.    This  committee  reports  to  the  Board.    However,  NTDC  has  not  yet \ndeveloped  policies  to  fully  reflect  its  independent  status  because  of  a  lack  of  resources.  The \nprogram support component includes provisions to hasten the development of audit policies and \nprocedures and to strengthen the capacity of staff.   \n \nG. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\nincluding \n\n76. \nThe quarterly progress reports prepared by NTDC will provide (i) a narrative description \nof  progress  made  during  the  period  (progress  on  compliance  with  environmental  and  social \nrequirements, \nthe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  resettlement \nframework, will also be included), (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems or \ndifficulties encountered, and (iv) work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports \nwill  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  subproject  components,  consisting  of \nsubproject  expenditures  during  the  period,  total  expenditure  to  date,  and  benefit  monitoring  in \naccordance with procedures and details acceptable to ADB. Performance will be evaluated on \nthe  basis  of  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  ADB \nManagement  will  prepare  periodic  reports  to  inform  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  of  overall \nprogress.  A  Board  information  report  will  be  submitted  annually,  and  progress  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to inform the Board of the approval of loan agreements. \n \n\n1. \n\nReview  \n\nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  first  loan  approval.  It  will \n77. \nreview implementation and operations including resettlement, and environmental aspects based \non  quarterly  progress  reports.  It  will  meet  with  the  Government  and  NTDC  semi-annually  to \ndiscuss implementation progress. A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after each loan \nbecomes  effective.  This  will  focus  on  the  engineering,  resettlement,  environmental,  and  social \naspects  of  ADB-supported \nfinancial  status  of  NTDC. \nRepresentatives of ADB and NTDC will take part in the review. The midterm review will evaluate \ncompliance with warranties and representations of the FFA and, assurances in individual loan \nagreements.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse  corrections  to  ensure \nsuccessful  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  the  subprojects  financed  under  individual  loan \nagreements. An Investment Program completion report will be prepared after the completion of \nall ADB-supported activities and projects under the Investment Program. \n \n\ninvestments  and \n\nreview \n\nthe \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Program Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\n78. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  provide  all  grid-connected  consumers  with \nadequate and reliable supply of electricity, which will support the Government\u2019s objective of 8% \nGDP growth per annum. Substantial investments in rehabilitation, augmentation, and expansion \nof the power transmission system will increase the reliability of supply to residential, agricultural, \ncommercial,  and  industrial  consumers  in  Pakistan.  A  secure  and  predictable  electricity  supply \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fwill  lead  to  social  and  economic  benefits  and  improve  conditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and \nother social services.     \n \nB. \n\nTechnical Analysis \n\n79. \nSubprojects  were  selected  following  a  load  flow  study.  The  study  was  based  on  an \nexpected  2013  conditions  and  follows  the  NTDC  demand  forecast  for  the  system  and  the \ndistribution companies. A least-cost expansion plan to meet the demand forecast was also used \nin the selection process. The subprojects were designed to address the problem areas identified \nby the load flow study. \n \n80. \nThe  NTDC  expansion  program  is  based  on  the  system  load  forecast.  NTDC  has  also \nhas  developed  a  nationwide  transmission  development  program  for  2005\u20132025.  A  significant \ngrowth  in  electricity  demand  for  Pakistan  is  forecast.  To  meet  this  demand,  substantial \ninvestments  will  be  needed  to  strengthen  the  transmission  system  to  evacuate  the  power \ngenerated by the additional power plants. \n \n81. \nNTDC has prepared load forecasts for the distribution companies.  These forecasts have \nbeen used for the subproject analysis and based on a high estimate of the distribution company \ndemand.  \n \n82. \nNTDC  has  prepared  a  long-term  system  expansion  plan  which  is  based  on  significant \nadditions  being  made  to  hydroelectric  power  generation,  the  number  of  coal-fired  thermal \nstations, and the number of independent power plants (IPPs) located in areas where there is \nnot  enough  load.  The  plan  assumes  the  mix  of  thermal  and  hydroelectric  power  will  remain \nbroadly the same as at present. However, this assumption may be affected by such significant \nvariables  as  availability  of  imported  gas  and  domestic  coal,  and  the  addition  of  a  major \nhydroelectric  power  plant.  These  have  the  potential  to  cause  a  fundamental  shift  in  the  long-\nterm  composition  of  the  power  mix,  with  a  resultant  change  in  the  expansion  of  the  primary \ntransmission system. The subprojects to be included in the tranche 1 would not be affected by \nany  drastic  changes  in  the  long-term  system  expansion  plan.  They  have  been  selected  to \naddress previous inadequate planning, underinvestment, and lack of maintenance.  \n \n83. \nA  detailed  study  will  be  undertaken  by  NTDC  to  provide  details  of  the  connection \nbetween  the  planned  hydroelectric  development  in  the  north  and  the  planned  coal-based \nthermal expansion in the south. Load flow and transient studies will be carried out to assess the \nsignificance of the connection of IPPs. These studies will be used to provide subprojects for the \nsecond, third, and fourth tranches. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Management and Financial Analysis \n\n84. \nFinancial  management  assessment  has  been  carried  out  to  evaluate  NTDC\u2019s  ability  to \nfulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements.  Questionnaires  and  field  interviews  were  used  to  review \ncurrent  practice.  NTDC  is  in  transition  and  the  assessment  was  designed  to  determine  its \npotential to achieve financial and operational independence. Accounting diagnostic tools, such \nas  the  World  Bank\u2019s  comprehensive  country  financial  accountability  assessment7  and  public \n\n                                                 \n7  World  Bank.  2003.  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment.  Washington,  DC \n\n(December). \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\ffunds \n\ninternal  controls, \n\ntransfer,  audit,  and \n\nexpenditure review,8 and ADB technical assistance9 have been used to review NTDC\u2019s financial \nsystems.  The  review  has  identified  issues  and  constraints  and  made  recommendations  to \nimprove  budgeting,  accounting, \nlegislative \ncompliance to ensure that NTDC\u2019s funds are efficiently and effectively utilized. \n \n85. \nThe  financial  management  risk  is  considered  acceptable.  NTDC  inherited  a  manual \naccounting  system  from  WAPDA,  which  is  being  computerized.  The  head  office  has  been \ncomputerized  and  this  will  be  extended  to  the  branches  in  due  course.  At  the  current  level  of \ntariff, NTDC is able to service and contribute the counterparty funds for tranche 1.  \n \n86. \nFinancial  analysis  of  the  proposed  tranche  1  investments  has  been  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects Financed by the Asian Development Bank.10 All financial costs and benefits have been \nexpressed at constant 2006 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR),  i.e.  capital  investment,  operations  and  maintenance,  insurance  costs  and  taxes \nreflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated  benefits.  The  current  transmission  tariff  (use  of \nsystem  charge)  was  used  to  estimate  the  revenue,  while  incremental  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \n87. \nThe  FIRR  of  24.7%  compares  favorably  with  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital  (WACC)  of  8.1%,  indicating  financial  viability  for  all  tranche  1  subprojects.  Financial \nviability  was  gauged  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  with-project  and \nwithout-project  investment  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the  increased \nevacuation  of  power  through  the  transmission  system  due  to  the  removal  of  transmission \nconstraints as a result of the investment. The tariff approved in January 2006 was used without \nany revision for the 30-year period that the FIRR was calculated for. Non-quantifiable financial \nbenefits such as quality of power supply were not included in the financial evaluation.   \n  \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n88. \nThe  proposed  investments  to  be  funded  by  ADB  are  least-cost.  They  are  part  of \nPakistan\u2019s  integrated  generation  and  transmission  expansion  program,  and  an  integral \ncomponent  of  the  transmission  system  development  plan  prepared  by  NTDC  using  least-cost \nplanning  principles.  The  economic  analysis  was  based  on  a  \u201ctime-slice\u201d  approach  to  the \ntransmission  system  development  plan,  as  individual  subprojects  are  not  stand-alone \ninvestments  and  would  not  yield  all  their  benefits  if  considered  in  isolation.  The  Investment \nProgram will ease chronic supply shortages and help meet the projected growth in demand for \nelectric power. Demand forecasts and cost\u2013benefit projections were prepared and analyzed and \nthe  Investment  Program  was  judged  to  be  economically  viable.  A  summary  of  the  economic \nanalysis is provided in Appendix 10.   \n \n89. \nThe main benefits stem from (i) removing existing bottlenecks in order to meet growing \nenergy  needs  by  facilitating  efficient  and  effective  evacuation  of  power  from  existing  power \n\n                                                 \n8  World Bank. 2004.

Economic \nincremental  cost\u2013benefit  streams  associated  with \nperformance  was  evaluated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  EIRR \ncompares the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits, based \non willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2006 constant prices. \nThe  analysis  period  includes  the  construction  period  and  30  years  of  operation.  Economic \nbenefits  accrue  to  consumers  and  the  economy  as  a  result  of  the  Investment  Program. \nIncremental consumption occurs because of the extended availability of adequate and reliable \npower supplies.  \n  \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nthe \n\n91. \nEnvironmental assessment for all the subprojects will be conducted in accordance with \nthe  Environmental  Assessment  Review  Framework  (EARF),  prepared by  the  Government  and \nagreed with ADB, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003), and the Government\u2019s environmental assessment regulations and guidelines (Pakistan \nEnvironmental Protection Act 1997). Of the tranche 1 subprojects, three of the 19 subprojects \nunder the first PFR have been categorized as B and the other 16 have been categorized as C \nunder  ADB\u2019s  environment  guidelines.  Environmental  assessments  have  been  carried  out  for \neach subproject. An IEE report and an EMP with implementation budget have been prepared for \nthe three category B subprojects. A review of environmental implications has been carried out \nfor  the  category  C  subprojects  and  presented  in  the  feasibility  review  compiled  by  the \nconsultants.  The  IEEs  and  reviews  of  environmental  implications  for  all  19  subprojects  are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nSubproject components have been redesigned, wherever possible, to minimize adverse \n92. \nenvironmental  impacts.  To  mitigate  the  potential  adverse  impacts  of  the  construction  stage, \ndetailed  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  have  been  prepared  and  attached  to  the \nIEEs.  No  component  of  any  subproject  falls in an  environmentally  sensitive  or  protected  area. \nThe  16  category  C  subprojects  are  essentially  installation  of  new  equipment  within  existing \nsubstations. The 19 subprojects in tranche 1 are all a long way apart and therefore there is no \nsignificant potential for cumulative impacts in the design, construction operational phases. The \nobjective  of  the  Investment  Program  is  to  produce  cumulative  benefits  to  the  transmission \nsystem  in  the  operational  phase.  Therefore  there  is  no  negative  impact  on  the  sector  and  no \nsector impact is provided. \n \n93. \nNTDC will implement and monitor the submission and clearance of IEEs and EIAs under \nstatutory  provisions.  It will  ensure  that  bidding documents  and  contracts  include  the  mitigation \nmeasures  required  in  the  EMPs  and  that  the  mitigation  measures  are  implemented  by  the \ncontractors. The Investment Program requires the establishment of an environmental cell within \nNTDC, and the appointment of environmental and resettlement specialists. \n \nF. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n94. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  is  expected  for  those  subprojects  that  will \nrequire  the  construction  of  new  grid  stations  or  transmission  lines.  Construction  of  new  grid \nstations  will  have  more  intense  impacts  than  transmission  lines.  The  only  permanent  LAR \nimpact  of  the  lines  will  be  connected  to  the  acquisition  of  tower  bases.  It  is  expected  that \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fimpacts  on  houses  and  resettlement  will  be  minimal.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework (LARF) for the Investment Program and the land acquisition and resettlement plans \n(LARP) for the Mardan and the Bandala subprojects, which are the only tranche 1 subprojects \nwith  LAR  effects  have  been  prepared  by  the  NTDC  and  agreed  with  ADB.  The  appraisal  of \nsuccessive  tranches  will  require  a  review  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  preparation  of \nLARPs  for  all  projects  with  LAR  issues.  Project  civil  works  will  need  to  comply  with  LARP \nrequirements. The LARF is appended as an appendix to the FFA while the LARPs for Mardan \nand Bandala subprojects are included as Supplementary Appendix J and K, respectively. \n\n95. \nIndigenous  peoples  will  be  affected  only  by  projects  in  North-West  Frontier  Province\u2019s \ntribal  areas.  The  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  (IPDF)  for  the  Investment \nProgram has been prepared and agreed with the Government. Appraisal of successive tranches \nwill require a review of the IPDF and the preparation of indigenous peoples development plans \n(IPDP)  or  appropriate  indigenous  peoples  action  plans  for  all  subprojects  with  indigenous \npeoples issues. Full IPDP implementation will be a condition of beginning project civil works. No \nindigenous  peoples  are  affected  by  tranche  1  subprojects,  the  IPDF  is  appended  as  an \nappendix to the FFA.  \n \nG. \n\nPoverty Assessment \n\nThe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  result  in  more  adequate  and  reliable  electric \n96. \nservices.  Electricity  will  be  evacuated  through  the  enhanced  500  kV  and  220  kV  transmission \nlines and substations, ensuring unrestricted seasonal flows of electricity between the north and \nsouth  of  the  country.  This  will  contribute  to  the  overall  objective  of  meeting  peak  demand  all \nyear  around  and  providing  sufficient  electricity  to  support  expected  accelerated  economic \ngrowth. \n \n97. \nGreater access to reliable electricity generated by the Investment Program will contribute \nto  poverty  reduction.  Poor  and  vulnerable  consumers,  including  hospitals,  schools,  and  other \nsocial utilities, are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power \nquality. They will benefit directly from the investments.  \n \nImproved  power  supplies  will  induce  light  industrial  and  commercial  activity,  creating \n98. \nemployment  opportunities  and  improving  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the \nmanufacturing and agriculture sectors. The Investment Program is expected to create new full-\ntime  employment  opportunities.  About  250  workers  will  be  hired  to  conduct  civil  works  under \neach tranche. Indirect positive impacts will result from the supply of power to the national grid, \nallowing  local  governments  to  generate  income  that  can  be  targeted  specifically  for  social \ndevelopment in the state, particularly for the poor. \n \nH. \n\nPotential Risks and Assumptions \n\n99. \nKey  assumptions  are  (i)  macroeconomic  growth  will  remain  stable;  (ii)  federal  and \nprovincial  governments  will  remain  committed  to  power  sector  reforms  and  there  will  be \ncontinued progress on policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms; and (iii) counterpart funds will \nbe mobilized in a timely manner. \n \n100.  Risks to the Investment Program include (i) delays in power sector reforms, both in tariff \ndeterminations  and  in  notifications  of  the  rates  applicable  to  the  distribution  companies  by \nNEPRA  and  the  Government;  (ii)  delays  in  tariff  determinations  and  notifications  of  rates \napplicable  for  NTDC\u2019s  wheeling  charges  by  NEPRA  and  the  Government,  to  facilitate \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\finvestments in power transmission facilities; (iii) increases in prices of cement, steel, fuel, and \nother raw materials that would render the Investment Program financially non-viable; (iv) delays \nin subproject implementation; (v) failure to complete environmental and social assessments and \nto  actively  pursue  and  secure  environmental  clearances \nfor  all  subprojects  before \ncommencement  of  construction;  and  (vi)  failure  to  mobilize  the  necessary  counterpart  funds. \nThese  risks  all  appear  low:  NTDC  is  committed  to  expanding  power  supply  within  Pakistan \nthrough  increased  investments  in  transmission  facilities.  The  lack  of  capacity  in  NTDC  to \nfacilitate environmental compliance is a concern, but this can be mitigated by making dedicated \nresources  and  staffing  a  condition  of  the  loan,  as  specified  in  the  FFA.  Risk  analyses  will  be \nexpanded to include sensitivity analyses at a later stage of Investment Program processing.  \n \n101.  Specific  assumptions  for  the  subprojects  under  the  tranche  1  are  (i)  counterpart  funds \nwill  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (ii)  there  will  be  no  delay  in  the  notification  of \ndistribution  company  tariffs;  and  (iii)  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA)  will  be \nestablished and empowered in a timely fashion, since without it the financial viability of NTDC \ncannot  be  ensured.  The  risks  are  (i)  there  will  be  a  delay  in  recruitment  of  consultants  and  in \nprocurement  of  turnkey  contracts  in  the  approval  process  within  the  federal  government  and \nNTDC;  and  (ii)  prices  of  equipment  and  materials,  such  as  cement,  steel,  fuel,  and  other  raw \nmaterials,  will  increase,  possibly  making  the  subprojects  financially  non-viable.  Contingency \nfunds will be allocated to respond to any unforeseen changes. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n102.  The  Government  and  NTDC  have  agreed  to  the  following  specific  assurances,  in \naddition  to  the  standard  assurances  and  assurances  agreed  to  in  the  FFA,  which  will  be \nincorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n103.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept  informed  about  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policies  and  programs  related  to  the  power  sector  that  will  materially  affect  the  \nfinancial viability of each subproject under the Investment Program, and in particular the power \ngeneration policies and program, as well as the power transmission policies and program.  \n\n \n\n104.  Tariff.  NTDC will submit a petition for tariff revision as required to maintain its financial \nviability. Following tariff determination by NEPRA, the Government will undertake to notify such \ntariff  determination  in  a  prompt  manner.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  tariff  formulated \nfor  NTDC  is  adequate  to  cover  its  operating  costs,  maintenance,  depreciation,  and  financing \ncost and to allow an acceptable return on the equity of NTDC. \n \nB. \n\nCounterpart Funding \n\n105.  The  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  NTDC  to  ensure,  the  availability  and  timely \nrelease of counterpart funding for the timely implementation of subprojects financed under the \nInvestment Program. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Management and Performance Indicators \n\n106.  Establishment of CPPA. The Government, through MOWP, and NTDC will ensure that \nthe  CPPA  is  established  as  an  entity  that  is  independent  from  NTDC  and  that  all  of  the  trade \ndebt incurred by NTDC for its single buyer role is transferred to CPPA or otherwise separated \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\ffrom NTDC.  The Government, through MOWP, will cause CPPA to define its corporate identity, \ndevise a business plan and a strategic development road map to have a single corporate body \naccountable for the single buyer business. NTDC will ensure it submits to NEPRA an application \nto revise its license to reflect the establishment of CPPA as a separate entity from NTDC. \n \n107.  Financial  Performance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  NTDC  will  maintain  a  debt \nservice coverage ratio of at least 1.2 from 2010 onward and a self-financing ratio of at least 20% \nfrom 2008 onward. \n \n108.  Financial Autonomy. The Government will ensure that NTDC bills the paying authority \ndirectly  and  in  a  timely  manner  for  the  transmission  services  render  to  its  customers.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  the  paying  authority  provides  prompt  payment  to  NTDC,  and  in \ncase of any shortfall from the paying authority, the Government will finance such shortfall in a \ntimely manner. \n \n109.  Auditing  and  Accounting.  NTDC  will  ensure  that  proper  accounts  and  records  are \nmaintained  in  a  timely  manner  to  adequately  identify  the  use  of  tranche  proceeds  in  such  a \nmanner  and  details  as  may  be  specified  in  each  Loan  Agreement  and  Project  Agreement. \nAudited financial reports of NTDC will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of fiscal year end. \n \n110.

Currently, about 45% of Pakistan\u2019s \npopulation has no access to electricity from the national grid. Existing bottlenecks in the power \ntransmission  network  are  expected  to  result  in  significant  system  capacity  shortfalls,  which  in \nturn could restrict the GDP growth by almost 0.8% in fiscal year (FY) 2008. \n \n4. \nTransmission and distribution losses in the Pakistan power system amounted to 25% in \n2005.  In  the  transmission  system,  these  high  losses  are  caused  by  the  excess  load  on  the \ntransmission lines and at substations. Total transmission losses are 7.5%, including secondary \ntransmission system losses. Primary system losses are about 3.0%. The transmission system is \naging,  overloaded,  and  poorly  maintained.  It  is  unreliable,  and  at  times  there  is  a  risk  of \ncollapse. The system needs immediate rehabilitation, augmentation, and expansion to provide \nservices  so  it  can  meet  consumer  demands  and  system  security  requirements.  The  safe  and \nreliable transmission of electricity remains a major challenge for Pakistan.  \n \nB. \n\nBackground  \n\n1. \n\nSector Policy \n\n5. \nIn  2000,  the  Government  unveiled  the  \u201cVision  2025\u201d  program  which  advocated \naccelerated  development  of  new  generation  facilities.  This  was  revised  in  2002,  with  greater \nreliance  placed  on  indigenous  fuel  sources\u2014hydropower,  thermal  generation  using  local  coal \nreserves or local gas supplies, and renewable technologies. \n  \n6. \nThe  2002\u20132004  power  policy  includes  an  increase  in  power  generation  capacity  and \nencompasses  private,  public  and  private\u2013public  models.  The  policy  continues  the  underlying \ntheme of Vision 2025 by encouraging the use of indigenous resources, principally hydroelectric \npower and coal. A number of thermal and hydroelectric projects are currently being processed \nunder the policy. \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n2. \n\nSector Strategy \n\n7. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  the  power  sector  has  three  main  intended  outcomes: \n(i) sector  reforms  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation;  (ii) more \ncapacity  building  in  all  sector  organizations,  including  financial  management,  efficiency \nimprovement,  use  of  the  clean  development  mechanism,  and  project  management;  and \n(iii) completion  of  large  infrastructure  development  projects  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution. \n \n8. \nThe  MTDF  contains  a  medium-  and  long-term  integrated  national  energy  security  plan \nfor the country. The objectives of the MTDF are (i) to increase power generation; (ii) to enhance \nthe exploitation and production of oil, gas, and coal resources and to increase the share of coal \nand  alternative  energy  in  the  energy  mix;  (iii)  to  optimize  the  use  of  indigenous  sources  and \nreduce dependence upon imported sources; and (iv) to encourage and facilitate private sector \ninvolvement.  Table  A2.1  shows  how  the  MTDF  envisages  that  the  primary  energy  mix  will \nevolve  over  time.  The  strategy  for  bridging  the  energy  gap  assumes  that  gas  will  be  imported \nfrom  four  different  sources.  Two  gas  pipelines  are  planned  for  2015,  a  third  for  2020,  and  a \nfourth for 2030. Any remaining deficit will be met by oil imports. The resulting power generation \nplan  is  presented  in  Table  A2.2.  To  address  the  overloading  of  the  NTDC  network,  MTDF \nrecommends the addition of four transmission lines and six grid stations to the 500 kV and 220 \nkV systems. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Primary Energy Mix \n(%) \n\nSource \nOil \nGas \nCoal \nHydro \nRenewable \nNuclear \n\n2005 \n13.0 \n54.0 \n  0.2 \n30.0 \n  0.0 \n  2.8 \n\n2015 \n27.0 \n44.0 \n12.0 \n13.6 \n  1.3 \n  1.9 \n\n2030 \n18.5 \n45.0 \n19.0 \n10.8 \n  2.5 \n  4.2 \n\n \n Source: Medium-Term Development Framework, 2005\u20132010. \n\nTable A2.2: Power Generation Plan \n(MW) \n\nSource \nOil \nGas \nCoal \nHydro \nRenewable \nNuclear \nTotal \n\n2005 \n6,400 \n5,940 \n   160 \n6,460 \n   180 \n   400 \n 19,540 \n\n2015 \n  6,860 \n24,970 \n  4,060 \n15,290 \n  1,650 \n  1,300 \n47,540 \n\n2030 \n    7,760 \n  83,770 \n  19,910 \n  32,660 \n    9,700 \n    8,800 \n162,590 \n\n Source: Medium-Term Development Framework, 2005\u20132010. \n\n \n9. \nThe  MTDF  also  sets  out  an  investment  strategy  for  the  power  transmission  and \ndistribution sectors. It recognizes that the existing transmission infrastructure and grid stations \nare  overloaded,  that  the  south\u2013north  and  north\u2013south  transmission  systems  need  to  be \nstrengthened, and that new generation projects need to be connected to the national grid. The \nMTDF also address the problems of the distribution network, including overloaded substations \nand  high  distribution  losses,  and  recommends  that  the  network  be  expanded  and  efficiency \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nimproved.  The  MTDF  makes  other  recommendations,  among  them  to  (i)  ensure  independent \nregulation of the power sector, (ii) unbundle WAPDA and establish and fully operationalize the \nsuccessor  companies,  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  privatization  program.  The  MTDF  also  specifies \nthe  need  to  further  strengthen  the  regulatory  role  of  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory \nAuthority (NEPRA).  \n \n\n3. \n\nMajor Stakeholders \n\na. \n\nMinistry of Water and Power \n\n10. \nThe Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP) is the federal government agency responsible \nfor all policy matters related to the water and power sectors, and for overall supervision of the \nperformance of organizations under its administrative control. In addition to its responsibility for \npolicy,  MOWP  performs  certain  specific  functions,  such  as  carrying  out  strategic  and  financial \nplanning  for  public  and  private  involvement  in  the  sector.  Proposals  for  power  sector  projects \nare scrutinized in MOWP, which assesses their technical and financial viability and adherence \nto  the  overall  strategic  plan.  Private  sector  projects  in  the  power  sector  are  processed  by  the \nPrivate  Power  Investment  Board  (PPIB),  supervised  by  MOWP,  which  establishes  policy \nguidelines  for  the  approval  of  private  projects.  Five-year  plans  and  annual  development \nprograms in water and power sector are all overseen by MOWP. MOWP also monitors activities \nin power generation, transmission and distribution and performs a supervisory and advisory role \nin ensuring the smooth operation of the power sector.  \n \n\nb. \n\nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority \n\n11. \nThe  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  was  established  by  the \nRegulation  of  Generation,  Transmission  and  Distribution  of  Electric  Power  Act,  1997  (Electric \nPower Act). It was created to introduce transparent and judicious economic regulation, based on \nsound  commercial  principles,  to  the  electric  power  sector.  It  performs  three  main  regulatory \nfunctions:  (i)  licensing  of  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  of  electric  power;  (ii)  tariff \ndetermination;  and  (iii)  setting  of  market  rules  and  operating  standards.  Over  the  last  5  years, \nNEPRA has established its regulatory credentials. ADB provided institutional capacity support to \nNEPRA in 2000 and 2001 through a technical assistance project.1 With regard to tariff setting, \nNEPRA  is  moving  toward  full  cost  recovery,  although  some  of  the  tariff  determinations  have \nfavored consumers and have contributed to the poor financial performance of power companies \nand investors. NEPRA issues licenses to generation, transmission, and distribution companies, \nas  well  as  making  tariff  determinations.  Tariff  determinations  are  notified  by  the  Government \nand then become effective.  \n \n\nc. \n\nWater and Power Development Authority  \n\nThe  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  was  established  by  the  Water \n12. \nand  Power  Development  Authority  Act,  1958. \ninclude  generation, \ntransmission  and  distribution  of  power,  along  with  additional  responsibilities  for  irrigation, \ndrainage and flood control. It owns about 58% of the country\u2019s total power generation capacity \nand  serves  over  13  million  customers,  representing  88%  of  all  the  electricity  customers  in  the \ncountry.  Between  1984  and  2005,  WAPDA\u2019s  total  installed  power  generating  capacity \n\nIts  responsibilities \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nquadrupled from 4,339 MW to 17,405 MW, of which 5,783 MW was generated by independent \npower  producers  (IPP).  Thermal  power  plants  contributed  70%  of  the  increase,  hydroelectric \npower plants 27.5%, and nuclear power plants, 2.5%. \n \nFollowing  the  passing  of  the  Electric  Power  Act  of  1997,  the  power  sector  was \n13. \nunbundled  from  WAPDA.  Under  business  transfer  agreements,  most  assets  have  been \ntransferred to new companies. Initially the shares of the companies were held by WAPDA. To \nincrease the independence of the companies these shares are now in the name of the President \nof Pakistan. The voting rights of the shares and the nomination rights for the board members of \nthe companies have been delegated to the Chairman of the Pakistan Electric Power Company \n(PEPCO), in accordance with a presidential directive.  \n \n\nd. \n\nPakistan Electric Power Company  \n\n14. \nPEPCO  was  established  in  1998  following  the  Government\u2019s  decision  to  amend  its \nstrategic privatization plan. PEPCO has been entrusted with the task of managing the transition \nof  WAPDA  from  a  monopolistic  structure  to  a  corporate,  commercially  viable  and  productive \nentity.  This  has  involved  (i)  deregulation  of  the  power  sector,  (ii)  promotion  of  IPPs,  (iii) \nrestructuring of WAPDA, and (iv) privatization of select corporate entities.  \n \nPolicy on WAPDA was amended because (i) despite the increase in generation capacity \n15. \nunmet  demand  still  existed;  and  (ii)  WAPDA's  growth  had  caused  inefficiencies,  \u201cdemand \nsuppression\u201d,  a  high-tariff  policy,  and  theft  of  power.  All  these  factors  had  adversely  affected \nWAPDA's financial condition. \n \n16.  WAPDA's  functions  under  its  water  and  power  wings  were  to  be  segregated.  It  was \npreviously envisaged that all power generation, hydro as well as thermal, would be corporatized. \nHowever, it has now been decided that hydro generation should remain part of the water wing of \nthe remaining WAPDA. \n \n\ne. \n\nNational Transmission and Despatch Company \n\nThe National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) is a public limited company \n17. \nincorporated  in  Pakistan  in  November  1998.  It  began  commercial  operations  in  March  1999. \nNTDC was granted a transmission license on 31 December 2002 by NEPRA to engage as the \nexclusive transmission company for Pakistan for a term of 30 years, pursuant to section 17 of \nthe Electric Power Act of 1997. Under this license, NTDC will undertake three specific functions: \n(i)  high-voltage  transmission  of  power  (220  kV  and  above),  (ii)  the  dispatch  of  all  power \ngeneration linked to the national grid, and (iii) the single purchaser and seller of power.  \n \nAs the sole transmission company  in Pakistan, NTDC is responsible for (i) maintaining \n18. \nand  upgrading  the  current  system;  (ii)  planning,  designing,  and  implementing  system \nexpansions;  and  (iii)  operating \nto  system \nrequirements  and  transmission  license  conditions.  The  company  took  over  properties,  rights, \nassets, obligations, and liabilities of 220 kV and 500 kV grid stations and transmission lines and \nnetworks owned by WAPDA under a business transfer agreement dated 1 March 1999.   \n \n19.  MOWP has determined that the single-buyer function licensed to NTDC will be handled \nby  an  independent  agency,  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA).  This  function  is \nbeing transferred from NTDC. A new license will have to be issued to NTDC and possibly the \nCPPA. As an interim measure, CPPA will be managed separately within NTDC. WAPDA Private \n\nthe  system  dispatch  generation  according \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nPower  Organization  (WPPO)  will  be  restructured  to  take  on  the  task  of  the  CPPA.  Terms  of \nreference  for  the  management  of  the  independent  CPPA  have  been  drafted.  ADB  has  been \nrequested to provide technical assistance for the establishment and start of operations of CPPA.  \n \n\nf. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n20. \nThe  Government  appreciates  the  need  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  power \nsector.  In  2002,  it  set  out  policy  for  power  generation  projects,  which  provided  a  clear  set  of \nincentives, along with a regulatory regime. This effectively created a framework to attract private \ncapital.  In  order  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in  power  generation,  transmission \nsystems  must  be  stable  and  reliable  and  new  investments  must  be  made  to  respond  to  the \nadditional  generated  capacity.  Pakistan  has  been  successful  in  attracting  private  sector \ninvestment  and  is  working  to  further  improve  the  enabling  environment.2  Independent  power \nproducers account for about 30% of electricity generating capacity. \n \n21. \nThe Government established the Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) in 1994. The \nPPIB  provides  a  \u201cone-window\u201d  facility  to  private  sector  investors  in  matters  concerning  the \nestablishment  of  power  projects  and  related  infrastructure,  including  negotiation  of  the \nimplementation  agreement.  The  PPIB  also  provides  support  to  the  power  purchaser  and  fuel \nsupplier in negotiating power purchases and fuel or gas supply agreements, and in liaising with \nthe  local  and  international  agencies  concerned.  With  Government  approval,  PPIB  is  also \nresponsible for  formulating,  reviewing  and  updating  policies and  procedures  relating  to  private \nsector investments in the power sector. \n \nThe  PPIB  has  facilitated  investments  of  over  $4  billion  from  the  commercial  sector.  All \n22. \npower  purchase  agreements  have  government  guarantees.  As  a  condition  for  private  sector \ninvestment  in  generation,  a  reliable  and  sustained  ability  to  evacuate  the  power  from  IPPs  as \nwell as delivery of the power to the end users is necessary. The power transmission investment \nplan will remove potential bottlenecks and ensure the evacuation of power generated by IPPs \nand  new  public  power  generation  facilities.  A  number  of  new  IPP  projects  may  also  include \ntransmission  components.  NTDC  will  actively  seek  commercial  investments  in  the  larger \ntransmission projects.  \n \nC. \n\nSector Issues  \n\n1. \n\nKey Opportunities and Challenges \n\n23. \nPakistan is a net importer of energy. During FY2000-2005, it spent about $3.3 billion a \nyear, equivalent to 22\u201325% of total imports, to import oil to meet its energy needs. In the first 9 \nmonths of FY2006, Pakistan's oil imports amounted to $4.6 billion, and for the full year, the total \nis expected to exceed $6.0 billion. Oil importation places a heavy burden on foreign exchange \nreserves and recent increases in oil prices and price volatility complicate this problem. Most of \nimported  energy  is  for  electricity  generation.  Even  with  all  this  imported  energy,  there  is \nsuppressed  demand  and  the  power  system  is  unable  to  respond  to  peak  demand  (partly \nbecause  of  lack  of  capacity  at  peak  summer  and  winter  periods).  The  winter  peak  demand  is \n                                                 \n2    ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Program \nCluster  of  Loans  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nputting thermal plants under pressure as increases to thermal generation have been insufficient. \nAbout 45% of Pakistan\u2019s population has no access to electricity from the national grid and uses \nkerosene, fuel wood, and other forms of bio-fuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. Pakistan\u2019s \nper capita energy consumption is one of the lowest in the world. \n \n24. \nThe electricity market has been characterized in recent years by marked changes in the \nprimary energy sources used to produce electricity. In FY1995, hydropower still accounted for \nnearly  50%  of  electricity  generated  by  generation  companies,  but  by  2005  that  share  had \ndropped to 30%. Over the same period, the share of thermally generated electricity increased \nfrom 50% to 65%, the result of capacity additions since the early 1990s. \n \n25. \nElectricity  consumption  has  grown  steadily  in  recent  years.  From  1995  to  2005,  total \nconsumption increased by more than 58%, from 35 to 55 terawatt hours (TWh) per year, with \nthe domestic sector accounting for the largest proportion of consumption, followed by industry \nand then agriculture. The demand for electricity is forecast to continue to rise. \n \nTo  meet  the  projected  increase  in  demand  of  around  10,000  MW  by  2010,  the \n26. \nGovernment  has  launched  a  large-scale  generation  expansion  program.  Nevertheless,  power \nshortages  are  anticipated.  To  minimize  future  supply  deficits,  Pakistan  has  adopted  a \nsystematic development plan called \u201cVision 2025\u201d that targets a long-term capacity increase of \naround 35,000 MW by 2025 (almost double the capacity in 2002). \n \n27. \nAbout  two  thirds  of  the  additional  power  (22,563  MW)  will  come  from  hydroelectric \nsources, while new gas-fired power plants will contribute 13% (4,680 MW), about the same as \nthat  generated  by  coal-fired  power  plants  (4,350  MW).  New  nuclear  power  plants,  with  a  total \ninstalled  capacity  of  1,800  MW  (5%),  are  also  planned.  Finally,  it  is  intended  that  renewable \nsources  of  energy  will  account  for  more  than  4%  (1,500  MW)  of  the  overall  newly  installed \ncapacity. The planned expansion will cost approximately $30 billion. \n \n28. \nNatural  gas-fired  plants  have  operated  almost  exclusively  on  domestic  resources,  as \nhave most of Pakistan\u2019s coal-fired power plants. However, this policy of reliance on indigenous \nresources is being reassessed in the light of increasing demands for electricity. \n \n29. \nSeveral board members and staff members hold concurrent positions on the boards of \nthe unbundled entities. This is not ideal from the corporate governance stand point. Because of \nthe  inherent  conflicts  of  interest  between  WAPDA,  distribution  companies,  generation \ncompanies, and NTDC, such concurrent memberships may make it difficult for board members \nto fulfill their fiduciary duty to act solely for the benefit of each entity. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Issues \n\n30. \nThe  power  sector  needs  sustainable  tariff  arrangements  and  resolution  of  the \nreceivables  from  distribution  companies  as  well  as  payments  to  generation  companies  for \nelectricity  supplied.  NTDC  plays  a  central  role  between  the  generation  and  distribution \ncompanies but its single buyer function has made the company financially unsound. Most of the \nPRs14 billion in losses incurred by NTDC in 2005 was because of the single buyer function. The \n2005  accounts  for  NTDC  also  show  that  the  cost  of  electricity  owed  to  the  generation \ncompanies was PRs192 billion but sales were only PRs189 billion. This PRs3 billion loss plus \nthe operation and financing cost make up the loss for the single buyer function. There are also \noutstanding  receivables  from  the  distribution  companies.  The  disparity  in  receivables  and \npayables are caused in part by the current tariff arrangement. Distribution companies have not \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nbeen  able  to  charge  cost  recovery  rates  where  as  generation  companies  and  IPPs  have  had \ncost  adjustments  for  their  tariffs.  The  tariff  determination  was  made  for  WAPDA  and  not  the \ndistribution  companies.  The  deficit  amount  covered  by  the  Government  is  a  subsidy  to  the \nelectricity consumers. Cost increases in the electricity generated by thermal plants because of \nincreases in fuel prices, will strain Government finances unless the distribution tariff is increased \nto cost recovery levels.  \n \n31. \nThe  current  Government  relending  rate  to  NTDC  is  17%,  pursuant  to  a  government \ncircular of 1996. The rate paid by NTDC for its commercial borrowing is currently about 12%. In \n1996 the commercial lending rate was over 20% and, considering the foreign exchange risk the \nGovernment  was  taking,  17%  seemed  to  be  justified.  However,  when  commercial  rates \ndecreased,  the  Government\u2019s  relending  rate  was  not  revised  so  as  to  instill  commercial \ndiscipline  in  state-owned  entities  by  forcing  them  to  borrow  from  the  market.  This  matter  is \ncurrently under review by the Ministry of Finance. \n \nD. \n\nTransmission Issues \n\n1. \n\nKey Opportunities and Challenges \n\n32. \nPakistan\u2019s power transmission system faces three major challenges: (i) the heavy power \nflow through the 500 kV system, (ii) a shortage of supply capacity for the 220 kV system, and \n(iii) high transmission losses. Hydropower plants are located mainly in the northern parts of the \ncountry and the thermal plants are primarily located in the south. There is a heavy power flow \nfrom north to south during summer when hydropower generation is high, and a heavy flow from \nsouth to north in winter when hydropower generation is low.  \n \n33. \nAccording  to  Government  estimates,  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan  is  forecast  to  grow \nby at least 8% a year during 2005\u20132015. To meet this increasing demand, it is estimated that \nPakistan would require an additional 2,000 MWs annually, which would need to be evacuated \nthrough  the  transmission  system.  Substantial  investments  are  required  to  strengthen  the \ntransmission system to (i) urgently address current shortfalls and quality problems, (ii) evacuate \npower  generated  by  additional  power  plants,  and  (iii)  supply  electricity  to  meet  the  growing \ndemand. \n \n34. \nThe  mismatch  between  the  location  of  demand  and  the  source  of  supply  requires \ninvestments  in  the  primary  network.  Current  peak  energy  and  capacity  shortfalls  are  to  some \nextent the consequence of shortages and bottlenecks in the national network. Primary network \nconstraints  cause  inefficiencies  at  the  consumers,  such  as  high  levels  of  un-served  energy  or \ninvestment  in  costly  self-  or  captive  generation,  at  a  significant  cost.  For  example,  the  export \ncompetitiveness of the textile sector is eroded by high electricity costs and unreliable supplies.  \n \n35. \nBecause of the weak grid infrastructure and substantial thefts of electricity, losses from \nthe  ex-WAPDA  transmission  and  distribution  network  amounted  to  some  25%  in  2005.  Total \ntransmission losses are 7.5%, including the secondary transmission system losses. The primary \nsystem losses are about 3.0%.  \n \n36. \nHigh  growth  in  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan  is  clearly  putting  the  existing  power \ntransmission  infrastructure  under  severe  stress.  There  is  a  clear  need  to  invest  in  additional \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nprimary  transmission  facilities.    The  Power  Transmission  Sector  Road  Map  for  2007\u20132016 \n(Appendix  3)  is  a  comprehensive  plan  that  specifies  the  details  of  system  renovation  and \nexpansion  and  makes  recommendations  on  how  a  reliable  and  high-quality  power  supply  can \nbe  delivered  to  the  growing  number  of  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and  domestic \ncustomers.  It  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  which  aims  to \nincrease  the  level  of  economic  activity.  It  has  the  following  intended  outcomes:  (i) a  more \nefficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply through a more reliable and stable system; \n(iii) greater  geographic  coverage;  and  (iv)  more  availability  of  and  access  to  affordable \nelectricity, by bringing hydroelectric and coal-fired thermal energy to load centers.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTransmission System Overview \n\nThe  currently  installed  generation  capacity  of  the  ex-WAPDA  companies  amounts  to \n37. \n17,405 MW. Available generation capacity is about 13,000 MW because (i) hydropower plants \nare  dependent  upon  reservoir  capacity  and  hence  rainfall,  reservoir  silting,  and  irrigation \npriorities; (ii) the generation portfolio is ageing and subject to rating limitations and maintenance \nrequirements; and (iii) there are increased forced outage expectations.  \n \n38. \nThe  immediate  concern  is  the  capacity  of  the  transmission  network  to  evacuate  and \ntransmit  the  present  available  generation  output  to  load  centers.  The  maximum  transmission \nsystem demand of 13,051 MW recorded in summer 2006 is believed to represent the system at \nfull  capacity,  or  over  full  capacity  according  to  safety  and  sustainability  standards.  This  is  a \nconstrained maximum demand that is based on the capacity of the transmission network. It has \nbeen  estimated  that  at  that  time  there  was  800  MW  of  unsatisfied  demand.  Sections  of  the \ntransmission  network  are  known  to  be  running  periodically  above  rating  limits,  increasing  the \nrisk of forced and lengthy transmission outages.  \n \n39. \nThe load shed at generation, primary transmission and secondary transmission level is \nestimated to be about 800 MW. This load shedding figure does not include the \u201cload shed\u201d due \nto under-frequency and low voltage. This seasonal generation gap between supply and demand \nat present and in the near future is presented in Table A2.3. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Summary of Power Balances \n(MW) \n\nFY \n\nJul \n\nAug \n\nSep \n\nOct \n\nNov \n\nDec \n\nJan \n\nFeb \n\nMar \n\nApr \n\nMay \n\nJun \n\n2007     (710)     (401)     (412)     (422)     (384)     (326)     (826)     (354)     (402) \n2008  (1,389)  (1,368)  (1,353)  (1,337)  (1,303)  (1,279)  (1,575)  (1,514)  (1,268) \n2009     (798)     (449)     (438)     (407)     (430)     (645)     (408)     (406)     (413) \n   249 \n2010 \n   920 \n2011 \n   338 \n2012 \nFY = fiscal year, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Office of GM Planning Power, National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n\n   265 \n   870 \n   340 \n\n   283 \n   920 \n   317 \n\n   283 \n   919 \n   392 \n\n   267 \n   907 \n   338 \n\n   260 \n   898 \n   337 \n\n   262 \n   891 \n   392 \n\n   246 \n   869 \n   390 \n\n   266 \n   866 \n   384 \n\n   (812) \n(1,605) \n   (365) \n   257 \n   915 \n   390 \n\n   (823)  (1,129) \n(1,667)  (2,006) \n   (441)     (432) \n   248 \n   270 \n   880 \n   920 \n   374 \n   339 \n\n \n\n40. \nThese figures are based on the system generation capacity during the year.

More investment is needed in the primary network to accommodate future increases in \ngeneration additions. The case for primary network expansion rests on the mismatch between \nthe location of the power generation potential in the north (hydroelectric), south (coal) and west \n(imported  gas)  and  the  deficit  load  centers  (i.e.,  deficit  in  local  or  nearby  generation  as \ncompared  with  local  demand).  The  development  of  hydroelectric  potential  in  the  north  and  of \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\ncoal  resources  in  the  south  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  reliance  on  indigenous \nresources.  The  use  of  imported  gas  for  power  generation  has  been  necessitated  by  the \naccelerated utilization of domestic gas reserves. \n \n\n2. \n\nTransmission Sector \n\n46. \nThe  total  investment  requirement  for  NTDC  by  2016  is  estimated  at  $3.9  billion.  The \nurgent and immediate transmission system rehabilitation and augmentation plan for 2007\u20132011 \ntotals $915 million (32 transformers, 775 km of lines). Investments for 2012\u20132016 will mainly be \nto  facilitate  the  evacuation  from  new  generation  plants  as per  the  least-cost  power  generation \nplan. The transmission investment plan covers 62 transformers, 4,415 kilometers of lines, four \nSVCs,  and  20  new  grid  stations.  A  detailed  description  of  the  power  transmission  sector \ninvestment plan is provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale  \n\nPOWER TRANSMISSION SECTOR ROAD MAP AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\nPakistan\u2019s power transmission system faces three major challenges: (i) the heavy power \n1. \nflow  through  the  500  kilovolt  (kV)  system,  (ii)  a  shortage  of  supply  capacity  for  the  220  kV \nsystem, and (iii) high transmission losses. Hydropower plants are located mainly in the northern \nparts of the country and the thermal plants are primarily located in the south. There is a heavy \npower  flow  from  north  to  south  during  summer  when  hydropower  generation  is  high,  and  a \nheavy  flow  from  south  to  north  in  winter  when  hydropower  generation  is  low.  The  mismatch \nbetween  the  location  of  demand  and  the  source  of  supply  is  creating  a  considerable  need  for \nprimary  network  investments.  Current  peak  energy  and  capacity  shortfalls  are  to  some  extent \nthe consequence of shortages and bottlenecks in the national network. \n \n2. \nThe  Medium-Term  Development  Framework,  2005\u20132010  (MTDF)  spells  out  the \nGovernment\u2019s energy sector strategy, including investments in power generation, transmission, \nand distribution. Based on the MTDF, the Government developed a long-term power generation \nplan. This identified the demand for increased generation capacity and addressed the size and \ntiming  of  the  commissioning  of  the  new  plants.  The  overall  power  transmission  strategy  is  to \nensure  that  the  electricity  from  the  new  power  generation  plants  is  evacuated  to  the  load \ncenters.  \n \n3. \nAccording to Government estimates, electricity demand in Pakistan is forecasted to grow \nby at least 8% a year during 2005\u20132015. To meet this increasing demand, it is estimated that \nPakistan  will  require  an  additional  2,000  megawatts  (MWs)  annually,  which  will  need  to  be \nevacuated through the transmission system. Substantial investments will be need to strengthen \nthe transmission system to (i) urgently address current shortfalls, (ii) evacuate power generated \nby additional power plants, and (iii) supply electricity to meet the growing demand. \n \n4. \nHigh  growth  in  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan  is  clearly  putting  the  existing  power \ntransmission infrastructure under severe stress and there is a clear need to invest in additional \nprimary  transmission  facilities.  This  power  transmission  sector  development  road  map  is  a \ncomprehensive plan that specifies the details of system renovation and expansion based on the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term power generation plan.  \n \nB. \n\nObjective \n\n5. \nThe objective of the road map is to show how the National Transmission and Despatch \nCompany (NTDC) can deliver a reliable and high-quality power supply to the rising number of \nindustrial,  commercial,  agricultural  and  domestic  customers. \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  has  the  following  intended  outcomes:  (i)  a  more \nefficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply through a more reliable and stable system; \n(iii) greater  geographic  coverage;  and  (iv)  greater  availability  of  and  access  to  affordable \nelectricity,  by  bringing  hydroelectric  and  coal  fired  thermal  energy  to  load  centers.

The cost of the subprojects ranges from about $4 million to $37 million.  The SVCs \nwill  improve  electricity  quality  and  stability  within  the  Lahore  ring.    From  2009  to  2011,  seven \nnew substations will have been built and 3 SVCs installed.  By this period, it is expected that the \nenvironmental and social work needed for the longer transmission lines (50\u2013200 km) will have \nbeen  concluded,  enabling  352 km  of  transmission  line  to  be  added  to  the  network.  These \ninvestments are expected to add about 3,000 MW of capacity to the system by 2011. The timing \nof  the  subprojects  to  be  commissioned  from  2012  to  2016  depends  largely  on  the  new \ngeneration  plants.

The component will ensure that the subprojects are implemented in \naccordance with the approved specifications and in particular that the environmental and social \nsafeguard  aspects  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  approved  plans,  through  the \nestablishment of a monitoring function. \n \n2. \nNTDC\u2019s  experience  in  all  technical  aspects  of  power  transmission  is  satisfactory. \nHowever,  training  in  modern  transmission  planning,  utility  management,  and  information \ncommunications  and  technology  is  needed.  The  investment  program  support  component  will \nstrengthen  NTDC\u2019s  (i)  planning,  (ii) design,  (iii)  project  management,  (iv)  operations,  and \n(iv) maintenance  activities.  Bilateral  exchange  programs  will  be  developed  with  foreign  power \ntransmission companies to develop role models among current and potential managers.  \n \n3. \nThe subproject preparatory activities under the investment program support component \nwill help NTDC to prepare the subprojects under tranche 3 and later. It will also provide funding \nin preparation for power evacuation from the proposed imported-coal-fired power station in the \nKarachi area. The objective of the component is to establish the resources and structures within \nNTDC  to  enable  it  to  carry  out  project  preparatory,  implementation,  and  monitoring  activities. \nPreparation  of  the  subprojects  will  include  a  feasibility  study  of  the  proposed  1,300-kilometer \n(km)  transmission  line  from  Karachi  to  Lahore,  based  on  the  proposed  imported-coal-fired \npower station in the Karachi area. NTDC asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider \nfinancing this subproject under the Investment Program.  ADB will review the feasibility report of \nthe proposed project, after which it will indicate whether it is willing to finance it. ADB would be \nprepared  to  consider  financing  such  a  long  and  complex  transmission  line  project  outside  the \nInvestment Program. \n \n4. \nIn  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  this  component  successfully,  there  will  be  three \nwork streams. The first work stream, preparatory activities, will focus on: (i) transmission sector \nplanning;  (ii)  individual  subproject  identification;  (iii)  subproject  assessments  (technical, \nfinancial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social);  (iv)  detailed  design;  and  (v)  procurement \ndocument preparation and bid evaluation.  \n \nThe  second  work  stream,  implementation  of  the  subprojects,  will  focus  on:  (i)  program \n5. \nand  project  management;  (ii) \ntechnical  operation  and  maintenance;  (iii)  contracting, \nprocurement, and inventory management; (iv) accounting, financial and economic management, \nand financial reporting; (v) the management information system and (vi) the economics of cost \nrecovery and tariff setting.  \n \nThe  third  work  stream,  monitoring  the  subprojects,  will  focus  on  (i)  establishment  of  a \n6. \nproject  performance  monitoring  system, \nincluding  permanent  and  contractual  staffing; \n(ii) periodic  performance  reviews  of  the  subprojects  and  the  overall  Investment  Program  to \nimplementation  arrangements,  progress,  and  achievements; \nevaluate \n\ntheir  scope, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4       43   \n\n \n\n(iii) environmental  monitoring;  (iv)  benefit  monitoring;  and  (v)  social  impact  and  resettlement \nmonitoring. \n \n7. \nThe outline terms of reference (TORs) for each of the three work streams are provided in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  It  is  envisioned  that  NTDC  will  engage  several  consulting  teams \nand individual consultants for the same subcomponent, and the outline TORs will be similar for \neach  consulting  team.    NTDC  will  also  be  able  to  engage  consultants  to  address  subprojects \nthat may not necessarily be financed or intended to be financed by ADB. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nFINANCING PLAN \n\n \n1. \nIf the Government of Pakistan\u2019s growth targets are to be met, it is projected that demand \nfor  power  will  grow  by  10,000  megawatts  (MW)  by  2010.    Without  a  stable  and  reliable \ntransmission  system,  any  additional  generated  power  will  not  be  evacuated  or  delivered  to \ncustomers.  The  total  investment  needs  for  the  next  10  years  are  estimated  to  be  $3.9  billion. \nThe National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) plans to fund 30% of this through \nself-generated funds and the rest through borrowing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other financiers. The Government is actively looking for funding from the private sector and \nother  agencies,  but  other  financiers  have  not  been  confirmed.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  will  act  as  the  anchor  for  the  investment  plan.  Financing  of  the \nimmediate and urgent subprojects planned for tranches 1 and 2 will provide additional revenues \nfor  NTDC  to  carry  out  the  large  investments  for  energy  evacuation  from  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs) from tranche 3 onwards. The investment program support component, funded \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources,  will  assist  NTDC  to  structure  the \nsubprojects so they can attract investment from commercial sources.   \n             \n\nTable A6.1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nTotal Investment Program \nAsian Development Bank \nOther Investors \nNTDC \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n   790 \n1,959 \n1,165 \n3,914 \n\nPercentage \n  20 \n  50 \n  30 \n100 \n\n \n\nNTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n\n \n                             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2. \nThe  total  investment  requirement  for  NTDC  from  2007  to  2016  is  estimated  at \n$3.9 billion. It is estimated that there will be a total of 51 subprojects. The urgent and immediate \ntransmission system rehabilitation and augmentation subprojects to be financed under tranches \n1 and 2 of the proposed MFF total $967 million. Investments for 2012\u20132016 will mainly facilitate \nthe evacuation from new power plants as per the least-cost power generation plan (tranches 3 \nand  4).  The  transmission  investment  plan  covers  68  transformers,  4,415  kilometers  (km)  of \nlines, 4 SVCs, and 20 new grid stations.   \n \n \n\nTable A6.2: Financing Plan Tranche 1 \n($ million) \n\nTranche 1 \nAsian Development Bank \nNTDC \n\nTotal \n\nAmount  Percentage \n\n226 \n  56 \n282 \n\n  80 \n  20 \n100 \n\n \n \n\nNTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n     \n \n3. \nThe tranche 1 projects will provide capacity to overloaded areas all over Pakistan.  The \n19  subprojects  will  consist  of  50  km  of  lines,  26  transformers,  two  substations,  and  one  static \nvar compensator  (SVC).  The cost of the subprojects will range from $4 million to $37 million.  \nThe SVC will be installed within the Lahore ring to improve electricity quality and stability. These \ninvestments  are  expected  to  add  around  3,000  MW  of  incremental  capacity  to  the  system  by \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5       45   \n\n \n\n2009. As noted in Table A6.2, 80% of the financing will come from ADB\u2019s loan and 20% will be \nself-financed by NTDC.    \n \n\nTable A6.3: Financing Plan Tranche 2 \n($ million) \n\nTranche 2 \nAsian Development Bank \nNTDC \n\nTotal \n\nAmount  Percentage \n\n579 \n145 \n724 \n\n  80 \n  20 \n100 \n\n \n \n \n\nNTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \nNote: Projects included in this tranche are from a list produced by NTDC. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n4. \nTranche 2 subprojects will continue to rehabilitate and augment the system through 16 \nnew  substations,  three  SVCs,  and  37  transformers.    By  this  time  it  is  expected  that  the \nenvironmental and social work needed for the longer transmission lines (50\u2013200 km) will have \nbeen concluded, enabling 725 km of transmission lines to be added to the network.  According \nto  the  financial  projections,  the  NTDC  will  be  able  to  self-finance  20%  of  the  amount  (Table \nA6.2).  The disbursements for this tranche are expected to take place from late 2007 to 2012.  \n  \n\nTable A6.4: Financing Plan Tranches 3 and 4 \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\nTranches 3 and 4 \nAsian Development Bank \nOther Financiers \nNTDC \n\nTotal \n\nAmount  Percentage \n\n     15 \n1,959 \n   973 \n2,947 \n\n    1 \n  66 \n  33 \n100 \n\n \n \n \n\nNTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \nNote: Projects included in this tranche are from a list produced by NTDC. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n5. \nThe timing of the 10 subprojects in tranches 3 and 4 will depend largely on the planned \nnew  generation  plants.  There  may  be  more  than  two  tranches.  Large  projects  such  as  the \nBasha Dam Dispersal ($1.2 billion) and the high-voltage line linking Karachi and Lahore ($800 \nmillion)  are  included.    The  other  eight  subprojects  will  range  in  cost  from  $43  million  to  $228 \nmillion. NTDC will depend on commercial and other financiers for 66% of the financing for these \nsubprojects. The 33% self-financing portion will be supported by the revenues generated from \nprojects  in  tranches  1  and  2.  The  investment  program  support  component  will  be  crucial  for \nmaking  these  subprojects  attractive  to  commercial  lenders  and  investors.  The  feasibility  study \nand  marketing  to  attract  investors  to  these  large  projects  will  take  place  at  the  same  time  as \nefforts to attract investors to the generation projects. Consultants under the investment program \nsupport component will work closely with the Private Power Investment Board.   \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \u2013 TRANCHE 1 \n\nNo. \n\nSubproject\n \n\nSubstation\n \n\nTechnical Justification \n\nTransmission \nLine \n\nNo. of \nLines \n\nLength of \nEach Line \n(km) \n\nTransformer \nCapacity \n(MVA) \n\nExpected Year \nof \nCommissioning \n\nCost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign  \n\nLocal \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n9.59\n\n \n3.46\n\n \n13.05\n\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n\ni\n\n \n\n1x237\n \n\n2007\u20132008\n \n\n4  Line Bay \n\nMardan  \n\n1 \n\n30\n \n\n-\n \n\n2006\u20132007\n \n\n \n5.17\n\n \n2.25\n\n \n7.42\n\nD/C from \nlooping point \nto Mardan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n\nTransformer\n \nExtension at \nTarbela 500 kV \n\nTarbela\n \n\n2  Transformer \nExtension at \nMangla 220 kV \n\nMangla \n\n3  Transformer \nExtension at \nLahore 500 kV \n\nLahore \n\nExtension at \nMardan and \nAllied \nTransmission \nLine \n\n5  Transformer \nExtension at \nGatti 500 kV \n\n6  Transformer \nExtension at \nMultan \n500/220 kV \n(220 kV \nTransformer \nExtensions)  \n\nGatti \n\nMultan  \n\n7  Transformer \nExtension at \nBannu 220 kV \n\nBannu \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWithout the extension, existing \ntransformers will become  \noverloaded in case of outage of \nS/C 500 kV Tarbela-Rewat or \noutage of a generator unit at \nTarbela 220 kV \n\ntransformers will become  \noverloaded in case of outage of \nS/C 220 kV Mangla-Ghkhar or \noutage of a generator unit at \nMangla 132 kV  \n\ntransformers will become  \noverloaded \n\nThe existing Tarbela-Mardan 220 \nkV D/C does not meet N-1 criteria. \nIf the loop is not applied, tripping of \none circuit will overload other \ncircuits. \n\ntransformers will become  \noverloaded \n\nThe extension will relieve the \nexisting 220/132 kV substations of \nPiranghaib, Muzaffargarh and will \nreplace or delay Multan Industrial \ngrid station.  \n\n1x138\n \n\n2007\u20132008  Without the extension, existing \n\n \n3.74\n\n \n1.42\n\n \n5.16\n\n1 \u00d7 600 \n\n2007\u20132008  Without the extension, the existing \n\n \n9.62\n\n \n3.59\n\n \n13.21\n\n1 \u00d7 450 \n\n2007\u20132008  Without the extension, the existing \n\n8.94\n \n\n3.26\n \n\n12.20\n \n\n3x160 \n\n2007\u20132008 \n\n10.01 \n\n3.86\n \n\n13.87\n \n\n1x160\n \n\n2007\u20132008  Without the extension, the N-1 \n\n3.42\n \n\n1.33\n \n\n4.75\n \n\ncriteria will be violated.

NTDC  has  the  ability  to  undertake  and  fulfill  fiduciary \nrequirements  for  the  proposed  Investment  Program.  Financial  management  assessment \nquestionnaires  and  field  interviews  were  used  to  review  the  present  standing  of  financial \nmanagement.  Due  consideration  has  been  taken  into  account  of  the  fact  that  NTDC  is  in \ntransition  from  being  a  part  of  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  to  a  fully \nindependent  corporate  entity.  Progress  on  strengthening  corporate  governance  and  financial \nmanagement is under way. Available public financial management assessment diagnostic tools, \nsuch  as  the  World  Bank\u2019s  comprehensive  country  financial  accountability  assessment 1  and \npublic  expenditure  review2,  and  ADB  assistance  programs3  were  reviewed  to  assess  NTDC\u2019s \nfinancial system.   \n \n\n1. \n\nCorporate Structure \n\n2. \nThe NTDC is a public limited company incorporated in Pakistan in November 1998 and \ncommenced  commercial  operations  on  March  1999.  The  NTDC  was  granted  transmission \nlicense TL/01/2002 on 31 December 2002 by NEPRA to engage as the exclusive transmission \ncompany for a term of 30 years, pursuant to section 17 of the Electric Power Act of 1997. This \n30  years  license  calls  for  NTDC  to  undertake  three  specific  functions:  (i)  transmission \noperations of the high voltage lines (220 kV and above), (ii) the dispatch of all power generation \nlinked to the national grid, and (iii) the single purchaser/seller of power.  \n \n3. \nAs the sole transmission company in Pakistan, NTDC is to (i) maintain and upgrade the \ncurrent system, (ii) plan, design, and implement system expansions, and (iii) operate the system \ndispatch generation according to system requirements and transmission license conditions, for \nsmooth  transmission  of  electricity  from  generation  companies  to  distribution  companies \ncountrywide. The company took over properties, rights, assets obligations and liabilities of 220 \nkV  and  500  kV  grid  stations  and  transmission  lines/  network  owned  by  WAPDA  under  the \nBusiness Transfer Agreement of 1 March 1999.  \n \n4. \nThe  Government  has  proposed  that  the  single  buyer  function  licensed  to  NTDC  be \nhandled by an independent agency. Procedures are on\u2013going for separation of this function and \nfinancial accounts from NTDC. A new license will have to be issued to NTDC and the Central \nPower  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA).  Tariff  determinations  will  have  to  be  made  for  CPPA  and \nagreements with generation companies and independent power producers have been revised. \nAs  an  interim  measure,  CPPA  will  be  managed  separately  within  NTDC.  A  part  of  WAPDA \nPrivate Power Organization will be restructured to take on the task of CPPA.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Management Issues and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe financial sustainability of the power transmission sector is dependent on timely and \n5. \naccurate (i) submission of tariff applications by NTDC, (ii) execution of the tariff determination by \n\n                                                \n \n1 Islamic Republic Of Pakistan, Country Financial Accountability Assessment, World Bank, December 2003 \n2 Pakistan Public Expenditure Management, Strategic Issues and Reform Agenda, World Bank, January 2004 \n3 Institutional Capacity Building Of The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) TA 4130 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9       55   \n\n \n\nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), (iii) notification of the tariff determination \nby  the  Government,  and  (iv)  collection  of  payments  from  distribution  companies  to  NTDC  for \ntransmission  charges.  As  for  corporate  issues,  NTDC  has  (v)  financial  and  (vi)  management \nindependence issues that need to be remedied. \n \n\n1. \n\nTariff Issue (i), (ii) and (iii) \n\n \n6. \nIn  the  tariff  determination,  revenue  requirement  cover  general  establishment  and \nadministrative expenses, insurance, repair & maintenance (1% gross fixed assets in operation), \nNEPRA  license  fee  (adjusted  for  inflation),  depreciation  (3.5%  of  average  gross  fixed  assets), \ndebt servicing (11.71% weighted average cost of debt) and, corporate income taxe (35%) and \nreturn on equity self-financing for its capacity expansion program (12.75%) less other income.  \nThe latest tariff determination was in January 2006 for 2005-2006.  The application was made \nby NTDC on 30 May 2005.  Stakeholders were notified of the salient features in a newspaper \nadvertisement  on  11  June  2005.  In  response  to  the  interventions  NEPRA  decided  to  hold  a \nhearing  on  22  August  and  issues  raised  by  the  stakeholders  were  addressed  by  NTDC. \nDetermination  was  notified  on  6  January  2006.      This  tariff  will  remain  effective  until  the  next \napplication by NTDC, determination by NEPRA and notification by government.   Two types of \ntariff are determined for transmission the fixed and variable use of systems charge.   \n \nAlthough  NEPRA\u2019s  determination  procedures  took  6  months,  considering  the  due \n7. \nprocess  involved  this  is  not  excessive.    The  quality  of  the  past  submissions  by  NTDC  seems \nadequate  upon  inspection  and  has  withstood  the  determination  process.  NTDC  is  taking \nmeasures  to  improve  the  timeliness  of  tariff  revision  petitions  to  NEPRA  however  the  next \nrevision is not necessary until 2008. The level of tariff determined stands to logic and is at a cost \nrecovery level with allowance for the investment.   \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial independence (iv) and (v)  \n\n \n8. \nThe  unbundling  of  the  power  sector  has  been  on-going  since  1999.  To  achieve \nefficiencies  and  transparency  that  were  intended  through  unbundling,  financial  as  well  as \nmanagement  independence  is  necessary.  NTDC  continues  to  be  financially  dependent  on \nWAPDA,  NTDC  currently  has  satisfactory  accounting  capacities  and  established  accredited \nexternal audit processes in accordance with international audit standards. In addition, NTDC is \ndeveloping  sufficient  in  house  functions  and  systems  to  handle  payments,  billings,  and \ncollections. Accordingly, these functions can safely be transferred from WAPDA to NTDC.       \n \n\n3. \n\nManagement Independence (vi) \n\n \n9. \nAs  the  transition  period  is  concluding  and  NTDC  has  built  capacity  for  independence \nfrom  WAPDA,  the  corporate  governance  structure  of  its  Board  should  be  in  accordance  with \nbest international practices. Currently, the Board consists of a Chairman, three members from \nthe private sector, and three officials. The Board represents the interest of the sole owner, the \nGovernment.    The  nomination  of  the  board  members  is  made  by  Chairman  Pakistan  Electric \nPower Company (PEPCO) in accordance with a presidential directive.   The Chairman of NTDC \nand  another  Director  hold  concurrent  seats  in  WAPDA,  PEPCO  and  NTDC.    The  unbundling \nprocess  has  come  to  a  stage  where  the  same  individual  holding  multiple  board  of  directors\u2019 \npositions  may  not  be  the  most  efficient  way  of  promoting  Government\u2019s  power  sector  policy. \nWith  the  independence  of  NTDC,  the  representatives  who  hold  seats  in  WAPDA  or  any  other \ncompany  that  holds  generation  assets  has  conflict  of  interest.    Persons  with  such  conflict  of \ninterest may find it difficult to duly exercise their fiduciary duties and their oversight role.  \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n4. \n\nOther issues \n\n \n10. \nThe  current  on-lending  rate  is  17%  pursuant  to  a  government  circular  of  1996 \nconcerning on-lending to autonomous state owned entities.  This rate is currently above the rate \npaid by NTDC for its commercial borrowing, around 12%.  Instead of a fixed rate, consideration \nshould be given to benchmark the rates to the borrowing cost of the Government with premium \ncharged  for  foreign  exchange  and  credit  risk  of  NTDC  (autonomous  government  entity). \nHowever, even with this rate, the projects under Tranche 1 are financially viable.  \n \n11. \nNTDC  inherited  a  manual  accounting  system  from  WAPDA  and  which  is  being \ncomputerized  at  present.  The  Head  Office  has  been  computerized  and  the  branches  will  be \ncomputerized by the end of 2006.  The speed of computerization and training has been in line \nwith the plan thus far.  Expectation is for the progress to be consistent with the current pace.  \n \n12. \nThe  internal  audit  function  currently  report  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the \nprocedures are based on those which they have inherited from WAPDA.  The Audit Committee \nwhich reports to the board was established last year and is chaired by an outside auditor with \nthe  NTDC  Audit  Manager  as  the  Secretary.    Discussions  have  been  taking  place  in  this \ncommittee to establish NTDC\u2019s own audit procedures and policies as an independent entity.   \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n13. \nThe transmission business of NTDC (excluding CPPA) has been financially sound in the \nlast 3 years.   Revenue from the transmission tariff was separated from CPPA only in 2005 and \nit is only during this year that the affect of CPPA on NTDC is visible.

Based on the most recent tariff determination UoSc is Rs. 86.10 kW/month for 2006, \nRs. 95.40 for 2007 and Rs. 100.15 for 2008. The projections have been made on the prudent \nbasis that the 2008 UoSC is increased by 7.3% per annum until 2015. The increase in revenue \narises  due  to  additional  capacity  being  available  due  to  removal  of  constraints  from  the \ntransmission  systems  a  result  of  the  proposed  project  investment  in  additional  transformers  / \ntransmission  lines  and  new  grid  substations.  This  additional  capacity  is  3,130  MW  in  2009 \nincreasing  to  18,026  MW  by  2015  and  has  been  estimated  by  simulating  with  and  without \nproject scenarios in the load flow analysis.    \n \nThe  main  items  of  operating  costs  in  terms  of  value  are  salaries  and  wages  and \n16. \ndepreciation.  In  2005,  the  total  number  of  employees  was  9,877  at  an  average  annual  cost \n(inclusive of benefits) of Rs. 191,000. According to past records the number of employees has \nnot fluctuated noticeably since 2000. Close to 2000 employees are expected to be transferred to \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \nItem\n\nIncome Statement Summary\nRevenue\nOperating Cost\nNet Income  (Note 1)\n\nBalance Sheet Summary\nFixed Assets\nCurrent Assets (Note 2)\n    Total Assets\nCurrent Liabilities (Note 2)\nLong Term Debt\nEquity\n    Total Liabilities and Equity\n\nthe distribution companies when they take over the 134kv transmission lines. Also around 100 \nemployees  are  expected  to  be  transferred  to  the  CPPA  when  established.  Therefore,  it  has \nbeen assumed that 8,000 employees will be the base for 2005 with 3% annual increase in the \nnumber  of  employees  for  the  period  up  to  2015  and  that  the  salaries  cost  will increase  in line \nwith local inflation. Depreciation has been estimated using the rates in operation at NTDC, the \nmain  item  being  transmission  and  dispatch  equipment  at  3.5%  p.a.  on  a  straight  line  basis. \nRepairs  and  maintenance  cost  has  been  projected  on  the  basis  of  what  has  been  allowed  by \nNEPRA, at 0.5% of gross fixed assets. Insurance cost is projected at 0.35% of the net value of \ntransmission assets. In addition to the investments under the proposed ADB project, the NTDC \ncapital expenditure program has also been incorporated.  \n \n17. \nThe proposed ADB facility will be relent by the Government to NTDC. For the purpose of \nthe  projections  it  has  been  assumed  that  the  on-lending  rate  will  be  at  17%  (the  current  on-\nlending rate) and the repayment terms will mirror that of the ADB facility, a grace period of three \nyears and repayment over 20 years.   \n \n\nTable A9.2: NTDC Financial Projections \n\nAudited Projected\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n10,677\n3,985\n(1,638)\n\n11,039\n4,868\n3,476\n\n12,231\n4,785\n3,380\n\n12,840\n5,051\n1,726\n\n17,763\n5,957\n3,266\n\n26,019\n6,653\n7,647\n\n30,579\n7,761\n6,156\n\n35,865\n9,022\n4,958\n\n41,691\n10,945\n4,195\n\n48,280\n12,451\n4,193\n\n55,405\n14,585\n6,090\n\ny\n\nCashflow Summar\nNet Cash from Operating Activities\nNet Cash from financing\nNet Cash from Investing\nIncrease / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n\n(3,585)\n11,584\n(6,112)\n1,887\n\n5,234\n11,675\n(10,491)\n6,417\n\n5,309\n16,279\n(18,189)\n3,399\n\n4,316\n17,016\n(19,060)\n2,271\n\n4,401\n19,829\n(26,850)\n(2,620)\n\n8,978\n29,741\n(34,107)\n4,612\n\n9,052\n42,516\n(53,677)\n(2,109)\n\n9,428\n30,910\n(37,695)\n2,643\n\n10,835\n37,219\n(44,900)\n3,153\n\n12,220\n30,707\n(55,357)\n(12,431)\n\n15,547\n5,384\n(27,889)\n(6,958)\n\n58,776\n90,137\n148,913\n86,929\n24,348\n37,638\n148,915\n\n66,669\n32,366\n99,035\n24,451\n32,710\n41,874\n99,035\n\n82,138\n35,764\n117,902\n26,728\n43,739\n47,435\n117,902\n\n98,413\n38,036\n136,449\n28,889\n54,243\n53,317\n136,448\n\n122,070\n36,757\n158,827\n31,401\n66,403\n61,022\n158,826\n\n152,514\n41,480\n193,994\n34,930\n83,348\n75,716\n193,994\n\n201,561\n39,439\n241,000\n41,231\n113,272\n86,497\n241,000\n\n233,509\n42,146\n275,655\n45,211\n132,387\n98,058\n275,655\n\n270,813\n45,347\n316,160\n50,302\n156,735\n109,122\n316,160\n\n317,232\n32,959\n350,191\n55,198\n180,203\n114,790\n350,191\n\n334,154\n26,019\n360,174\n56,147\n185,278\n118,749\n360,173\n\n109%\n1.3\n20%\n3%\n\n119%\n1.0\n16%\n5%\n\n122%\n1.6\n23%\n10%\n\n148%\n1.3\n22%\n7%\n\n154%\n1.2\n21%\n5%\n\n165%\n1.2\n24%\n4%\n\n181%\n1.1\n29%\n4%\n\n179%\n1.2\n37%\n5%  \n\nKey Performance Indicators\nLong Term Debt to Equity Ratio\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times)\nSelf Financing Ratio\nReturn on Equity Ratio\nNTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nE. \n\nConclusion \n\n62%\n1.3\n-46%\n-4%\n\n79%\n1.3\n43%\n8%\n\n97%\n1.7\n33%\n7%\n\n18. \nThe financial management of NTDC is adequate to carry out the fiduciary duties of the \nproposed Investment Program. In terms of financial strength, for the counter party funds, NTDC \nremains  profitable  up  to  2015,  even  under  a  very  conservative  assumption  that  the  annual \nincrease in the UoSC from 2008 is only by 7.3%. Return on equity is 10% in 2010 and 6% in \n2015. More importantly NTDC produces adequate cashflow to maintain its operations and meet \nits  debt  service  obligations.  The  debt  service  coverage  ratio  (DSRC)  stands  above  1.2  times \nfrom 2010 and the self financing ratio, is very satisfactory from 2010 onwards.  \n \n19. \nIn terms of management, measures are being taken to strengthen the independence and \ntransparency  of  the  system.    These  steps  seem  adequate  and  appropriate  considering  the \nmaturity  of  NTDC  in  the  unbundling  process.

The \neconomic analysis is based on a time-slice approach to the transmission system development \nplan, since individual subprojects are not stand-alone investments and in some instances would \nnot  yield  all  their  benefits  if  they  were  considered  in  isolation.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  compares  the  annual  streams  of  economic  capital  and  operating  costs  against  benefits \nbased on willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2006 constant \nprices. The analysis period includes the construction period and 30 years of operation. Details \nof  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic  analysis  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. The economic analysis confirms that the Investment Program will \nease  chronic  supply  shortages  in  the  country  and  help  meet  projected  growth  in  demand  for \nelectric power. Demand forecasts and cost\u2013benefit projections were prepared and analyzed and \nthey indicated that the Investment Program is economically viable. \n \nB. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  nationwide  power  demand  is  projected  to  grow  at  7.9%  during  2006\u20132010  and  to \nincrease from 15,500 megawatts (MW) in FY 2006 to 21,500 MW in FY 200 (Table A10.1). To \ncope  with  the  growth  in  electricity  demand,  it  is  estimated  that  Pakistan  would  require  about \n2,000  additional  MW  newly  installed  capacity  to  be  added  annually.  The  additional  generated \npower  increase  would  need  to  be  evacuated  through  the  transmission  system  and  brought  to \nthe consumers through the distribution systems.  \n \n\nTable A10.1: Physical Targets: Power Sector \n \n\nItem \n\nMaximum Demand \n     Growth Rate \nEnergy Generation \n     Annual Energy    \n\nGeneration \n     Growth Rate \nEnergy Sale \n     Annual \nSale \n     Growth Rate \n \n\nEnergy \n\n \n \nMW \n(%) \nGWh \n \n\n(%) \n \nGWh \n\n \n \n\nBenchmark \nFY2005 \n14,621 \n       3.4 \n \n87,992 \n\n       3.2 \n \n66,094 \n\n      6.1 \n \n\nFY2006 \n15,511 \n       6.1 \n \n93,257 \n\nFY2007 \n16,526 \n       6.5 \n \n99,247 \n\n       6.0 \n \n71,520 \n\n      6.4 \n \n77,905 \n\nTargets \nFY2008 \n17,904 \n       8.3 \n \n107,484 \n\n       8.3 \n \n85,352 \n\nFY2009 \n19,534 \n       9.1 \n \n117,351 \n\nFY2010 \n21,426 \n       9.7 \n \n128,673 \n\nTotal \nACGR \n21,426 \n       7.9 \n \n128,673 \n\n       9.2 \n \n93,800 \n\n       9.6 \n \n103,516 \n\n       7.9 \n \n103,516 \n\n      8.2 \n \n\n      8.9 \n \n\n      9.6 \n \n\n       9.9 \n \n\n      10.4 \n \n\n       9.4 \n \n\nFY# = fiscal year, GWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan.\n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nNTDC  prepares  electricity  demand  forecasts  for  its  least-cost  planning  purposes.  The \n3. \nlatest  forecast,  covering  a  period  from  FY2005  to  FY2025,  was  prepared  using  a  regression \nbased approach. Historical data suggest that, between 1995 and 2005, system demand grew at \n3.1% p.a., but for the second half of this period, 2000\u20132005, the growth rate increased to 5.6% \np.a..  In  FY2005,  the  demand  increased  by  8.6%.  The  relatively  low  growth  rates  experienced \nduring the late 1990s gave rise to a degree of complacency and new system additions were not \nmade. This period also saw some reduction in maintenance budgets, all of which resulted in a \nsystem that is now unable to meet the demand for electricity. The high economic growth rates of \nrecent years have necessitated plans for accelerated and large investments in the power sector. \nFor  the  purposes  of  the  least-cost  analysis,  NTDC\u2019s  base  case  demand  and  energy  forecast \nwere  considered.  The  forecasts  result  in  an  average  load  growth  of  8%  p.a.  over  the  20-year \nperiod. The forecast is summarized in Table A10.2 below. \n \n\nTable A10.2: NTDC Load Forecast \n(base case)  \n\nFY \n2005 \n2010 \n2015 \n2020 \n2025 \nGrowth p.a.  \n\nEnergy Sales (GWh) \n  53,620 \n  81,770 \n127,224 \n181,272 \n267,652 \n    8.37% \n\nPeak Demand (MW) \n12,063 \n17,356 \n26,769 \n38,084 \n56,232 \n  8.00% \n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt \nSource: Office of GM Planning, National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n\n \n4. \nLocal level load forecasts were analyzed as they are an important input for developing \nthe  load  flows  at  the  primary  transmission  level.

The number of villages electrified has increased sharply in the last \nfew  years,  from  68,292  in  2000  to  90,467  in  2005,  adding  an  estimated  demand  of  about \n3,000 MW.

The system is unable to meet the demand. The maximum demand \n(at  NTDC  network)  recorded  in  2006  is  13,051  MW,  compared  with  an  installed  capacity  of \n17,405  MW  in  2005.

The  transmission \ninvestments were confirmed to be an integral part of the least-cost power sector development \nprogram for Pakistan. \n \n\n2. \n\nCost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n\n8. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation was based on incremental cost \nand  benefit  streams  associated  with  each  tranche  of  investment.  Economic  performance  was \nevaluated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Incremental  consumption  occurs \nbecause  of  the  extended  availability  of  lower-cost  grid-sourced  electricity.  Economic  benefits \naccrue to consumers and the economy as a result of the Investment Program.  \n \n9. \nThe  main  benefits  stem  from  (i)  removing  existing  bottlenecks  by  facilitating  efficient \nevacuation of power from existing power stations, (ii) improving efficiency reliability and system \nsecurity,  (iii)  evacuating  power  from  additional  power  stations,  and  (iv)  reducing  losses.  The \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nphysical output\u2014rehabilitated, augmented, and expanded transmission infrastructure\u2014will add \nto existing supply (incremental benefit) and will substitute for alternative forms of energy supply. \nThe  incremental  benefits  were  valued  for  each  category  of  customer,  using  customers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for electricity. \n \n\n3. \n\nCalculation of Willingness to Pay \n\n10. \nThe  value  of  each  unit  of  electricity  to  customers  was  estimated  by  comparing  current \nprices  against  the  price  of  alternative  sources  of  electricity.  Particular  consumer  classes  were \nassumed to be willing to pay the difference between the present cost for an alternative source of \nelectricity  and  the  amount  charged  for  incremental  grid-supplied  units.  This  was  used  as  the \nbasis  for  the  willingness  to  pay  calculation.  The  analysis  identified  four  classes  of  electricity \nconsumer: agricultural, residential, commercial, and industrial. The focus is on the main energy \nuse  (and  the  alternative  source),  rather  than  on  the  full  range  of  appliances  used  by  the \ncustomer category to calculate the real value for lost load. Table A10.4 shows the willingness to \npay and price of alternative energy for each consumer category. \n\n \nTable A10.4: Willingness to Pay Estimates \n \n\nSector \n \nResidential \nAgricultural \nCommercial \nIndustrial \nWeighted average \n\nWillingness to Pay  \n(PRs/kWh) \n13.82 \n10.73 \n11.07 \n10.24 \n12.11 \n\nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n4. \n\nResults \n\n11. \nThe  economic  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  results  in  an  EIRR  of  24%  for  the  Investment \nProgram.  The  net  benefits  of  the  Investment  Program  were  estimated  to  be  $3.7  billion.  The \nsensitivity  analyses  show  that  the  Investment  Program  remains  justified  even  if  various  risks \nmaterialize.  Tranches  3  and  4  are  sensitive  to  reductions  in  demand,  but  this  is  considered  a \nrelatively small risk given Pakistan\u2019s long history of unmet demand.  \n \n\nTable A10.5: Summary of EIRR Calculation for the Investment Program \n \n2009\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2016\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2017\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2018\n\n2036 NPV\n\nItem\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n306\n306\n\n861\n861\n\n1403\n1403\n\n2024\n2024\n\n2691\n2691\n\n3349\n3349\n\n4028\n4028\n\n4700\n4700\n\n5391\n5391\n\n6137\n6137\n\n6928 15464\n6928 15464 33602\n\n95\n156\n251\n\n21\n21\n272\n\n561\n307\n868\n\n37\n37\n905\n\n978\n510\n1489\n\n62\n62\n1551\n\n1615\n687\n2302\n\n96\n96\n2398\n\n2399\n493\n2892\n\n121\n121\n3014\n\n3199\n612\n3811\n\n152\n152\n3962\n\n3606\n612\n4218\n\n182\n182\n4400\n\n4357\n216\n4573\n\n193\n193\n4766\n\n4978\n0\n4978\n\n193\n193\n5171\n\n5207\n0\n5207\n\n193\n193\n5400\n\n5673 11468\n\n0\n\n5673 11468 29061\n\n193\n193\n193\n837\n193\n5866 11661 29897\n\nNet Benefits ($ million)\n\n34\n\n-43\n\n-148\n\n-374\n\n-322\n\n-614\n\n-372\n\n-66\n\n220\n\n737\n\n \n1062 3,803\n\n3,704\n\n \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return Calculation\n1.

The  analysis  results  in  an  EIRR  of  37%,  justifying  the \nviability of tranche 1 investment. Pakistan is a net importer of energy; there are currently peak \nenergy and capacity shortfalls; and growth in demand is forecast to continue.

The  Investment  Program,  to  be  financed  by  a  multitranche  financing \nfacility (MFF), will target Punjab, Islamabad and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) with, the \nNational Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) as the Executing Agency. The Program \nwill be divided into tranches, each covering subprojects for the construction or improvement of \ntransmission lines and grid stations. New transmission line or station construction will have land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts.  This  appraisal  of  social  safeguards  includes  an \nappraisal of tranche 1, two subprojects of which have LAR: the Mardan\u2013Line Bay extension and \ntransmission line, and the new Bandala station and transmission line. Subprojects implemented \nin NWFP may have impacts on indigenous peoples (IP).   \n  \nB. \n \n2. \nLAR will follow Pakistan law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and \nOperations  Manual  F2  on  involuntary  resettlement  (2003).  The  Investment  Program,  each \ntranche  appraisal,  and  the  approval  and  implementation  of  each  subproject  with  LAR  or  IP \nissues will require the following documents: \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  and  an  IP  development \nframework  (IPDF)  for  the  whole  Investment  Program  to  be  reviewed,  updated, \nand re-approved by ADB annually and before the preparation of each tranche; \nan  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  (IPSA)  indicating  whether  LAR  or  IP \nimpacts are expected, and if so their type and magnitude for each tranche; \na land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) with detailed design and impact \nfigures  and  compensation  budgets  and  schedules  for  each  project  with  LAR;1 \nand  \nan IP development plan (IPDP) or appropriate IP action for all projects affecting IPs.   \n\n3. \nThe  appraisal  of  the  Investment  Program  and  of  each  tranche  and  the  approval  and \nimplementation  of  each  subproject  under  a  tranche  will  follow  the  following  LAR-related \nconditions: \n\nInvestment Program and tranche 1. Preparation of the LARF and IPDF for the \nInvestment Program, and LARPs and IPDPs for tranche 1 subprojects with LAR \nor IP impacts.  \nOther  tranches.  LARF  and  IPDF  review  and  update  and  preparation  of  LARP \nand IPDP for all subrojects with LAR or IP impacts. \nStart of subproject civil works. LARP and IPDP implementation. \n \n\nTo comply with these conditions, the NTDP has prepared a LARF and an IPDF for the \n\n4. \nwhole MFF and a LARP for the Mardan and Bandala subprojects under tranche 1.  \n                                                 \n1  As per ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila, the length of a resettlement \nplan  depends  on  the  severity  of  the  impacts.  If  impacts  are  severe  (>  200  AP  resettled  or  with  >10%  income \nlosses), a project is classified as \u201cA\u201d and a full resettlement plan is required.

NTDC  has  overall  responsibility  for  LAR  preparation, \n6. \nimplementation,  and  financing  and  will  exercise  its  functions  through  two  project  management \nunits  (PMUs),  responsible \ntheir  areas,  and  project \nimplementation units (PIUs), responsible for project-level activities. At the PMUs, LAR tasks will \nbe  handled  by  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit  (LARU).  The  LARU  will  be  aided  by  a \nsocial safeguard team under the project preparation and supervision consultants and by NGOs \nor  impact  assessment  or  valuation  teams  hired  for  onsite  impact  surveys  or  monitoring \nassistance.  PMUs  will  coordinate  with  local  governments,  which  have  jurisdiction  over  land \nadministration and valuation. At the provincial level these tasks rest with the Board of Revenue \nwhile  at  district  level  they  rest  with  the  district  collector  office  (DCO)  and  the  land  acquisition \ncollector (LAC). Agents such as the Patwari (land records keeper) will identify and verify titles. \nCompensation  for  assets  other  than  land  or  income  rehabilitation  is  the  responsibility  of  the \nrelevant  district  department.  To  ensure  effective  coordination  between  the  Executing  Agency, \nlocal governments, and other agencies, NTDC will establish an LAR steering committee at the \nprovincial level. An LAR coordination committee (LCC), including the elected representatives of \nthe APs, will be established by NTDC in each project district. Clearance of category B LARPs \nand IPDPs will be done by a social development specialist at the Resident Mission. Category A \nprojects will be cleared at ADB headquarters.  \n  \n7. \nDisclosure/Public  Consultation.  LARP  tasks  will  need  intense  AP  consultation.  The \nLARF  and  relevant  LARPs  were  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in  English.  The  LARF  and \nLARPs in local languages will be disclosed in the APs\u2019 communities. \n \n8. \nGrievance  Procedures.  APs may first lodge a complaint with the LAC. If settlement is \nnot reached within 30 days, the complaint may be lodged with the PMU. If the grievance is not \nsettled  within  another  30  days,  the  APs  can  seek  redress  at  the  appropriate  court.  The  LCC, \nwhich  includes  senior  members  of  the  APs  communities  and  their  elected  representatives  will \nassist the APs in these cases and will help them to communicate with NTDC.   \n\n9.   \nMonitoring and Evaluation. PMUs  will  internally  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on  LAR \nimplementation. The EA will report to ADB quarterly. External monitoring will be assigned to an \nindependent agency by the EA and external monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB once a \nyear.  At  the  end  of  project  implementation  the  independent  monitoring  agency  will  carry  out  a \ngeneral evaluation of LAR implementation. \n \n10. \nand provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \n \n\nFinances and Schedules. The LARF mandates that each LARP will detail LAR budgets \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11     67   \n\n \n\nIndigenous Peoples Issues    \n\nSpecific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans  \n\nD. \n \n11. \nTwo  subprojects  under  tranche  1,  Mardan  station  and  transmission  line  and  Bandala \nstation and transmission line will involve LAR. For both subprojects, a LARP in line with ADB\u2019s \npolicy and LARF requirements has been prepared, based on a detailed design.  \n \n12. \nThe  Mardan  subproject  will  affect  1.34  ha  of  agricultural  land  and  73.54  ha  of  crops. \nThere are 148 affected families (1,415 individuals). No AP will be resettled as no residential or \ncommercial land or house or structure is affected. LAR costs are estimated to be $640,000.  \n \n13. \nThe Bandala subproject will affect about 0.3 ha of agricultural land, 132 trees and 12 ha \nof crops (sugar, maize/wheat, rice). There are 24 affected families (174 individuals). No AP will \nbe  resettled  as  no  house  or  residential  or  commercial  plot  is  affected.  LAR  budgets  are \nestimated to be $96,000.  \n \nE. \n \n14. \nIP will be affected only by projects in NWFP\u2019s tribal areas. As these projects are yet to \nbe identified, no IPDP has been prepared so far. However, in accordance with ADB\u2019s IP policy \nprovisions,  NTDC  has  drafted  an  IPDF  detailing:  (i)  IP-related  project  processing  conditions; \n(ii) IPDP preparation and implementation requirements; (iii) IP definition in Pakistan; (iv) results \nof a general social assessment; (v) an IP strategy for the Investment Program and a definition of \nthe  type  of  IP  action  needed;  (vi)  IPDP  participation  instruments;  and  (vii)  general  processing \nand implementation issues. \n \n15. \nBased on the IPDF provisions and the social assessment results it is assumed that the \nPakistan  definition  of  \u201ctribal  peoples\u201d  will  correspond  to  ADB\u2019s  definition  of  IP.  The  IPSA \nprepared  for  each  tranche  will  include  an  indigenous  peoples  identification  assessment  (IPIA) \nproviding (i) general information on projects likely to affect IPs, the magnitude of the anticipated \nimpact, and the number and type of IPDPs to be prepared, and (ii) an outline of IP groups likely \nto  be  affected,  with  an  overview  of  their  demography,  social  organization,  livelihood  and  land \ntenure features, relations with government and other groups, adaptation to outside society and \nculture, and forms of local governance. \n \n16. \nmagnitude of the impact and the situation.  \n\nThe  IPDF  also  indicates  the  two  types  of  IP  action  that  will  be  needed,  based  on  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIf  impacts  affecting  IPs  are  limited  to  LAR  and  have  no  broad  community  or \nsystemic effect requiring the rehabilitation of an entire productive system, specific \nIP actions to mitigate the impacts will be included in the LARP.  \n \nIf  the  impacts  affecting  IPs  go  beyond  standard  LAR  effects  and  cause  broad \ndisruption  with  systemic  sociocultural  dimensions  and  wide  economic  and \ncommunity  effects,  a  stand-alone  IPDP  (including  a  detailed  action  plan, \nschedules  and  budgets)  will  be  prepared.  The  stand-alone  IPDP  will  not  only \ncover  LAR  issues,  but  will  provide  a  detailed  action  plan  based  on  direct  IP \nparticipation  in  the  socioeconomic  rehabilitation  of  the  affected  communities, \nincluding the provision of community development packages. \n\n \n17. \nInstitutional responsibilities. Based on the IPDF, NTDC will have overall responsibility \nfor actions related to IPs, including IPDP preparation, implementation, financing and monitoring \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthrough the two PMUs and the PIUs. The PMUs will be assisted by the social safeguards team \nunder  the  project  preparation  and  supervision  consultants  and  by  NGOs  in  project areas.  The \nPMUs will coordinate with local government authorities in tribal areas and with IPs\u2019 communal \norganizations. They will carry out all activities related to IPs in a way that is consistent with the \nadministrative  and  political  process  prevalent  in  tribal  areas.  In  particular,  the  PMUs  will  carry \nout their tasks in association with the political agent and the district coordinator offices. Through \nthem, it will make workable arrangements with the tribal leaders concerned (maliks, sardars or \nkhans).  The  tribal  leaders  will  consult  their  tribal  councils  (jirgas)  and/or  communities  to  make \nthe final decisions and take necessary actions in line with the Project\u2019s requirements. To ensure \ncoordination with the governments of the tribal territories, the political agents will be members of \nthe LAR steering committee in NWFP and Baluchistan and of the LAR coordination committees \nat  district  level.  ADB  clearance  of  category  B  LARP  and  IPDPs  will  be  done  by  a  social \ndevelopment specialist the Resident Mission. Category A projects (with stand-alone IPDPs) will \nbe cleared at ADB Headquarters.  \n  \n18. \nComplaints  and  Grievances.  Complaints  from  affected  IPs  may  be  addressed  to  the \npolitical  agent\u2019s  office  via  tribal  leaders  and  councils  (maliks,  sardars,  or  khans,  and/or  jirga \ncouncils). If convinced that the IPs have a case, the political agent will then call on the PMU or \nNTDC  headquarters  to  discuss,  negotiate,  and  resolve  the  complaint.  If  NTDC,  the  political \nagent,  and  the  tribal  leaders  cannot  find  mutually  agreeable  solutions  to  a  grievance  the \nrelevant subproject may not be implemented.  \n \n19. \nPublic  Consultation  and  Disclosure.  IP  tasks  will  be  planned  and  executed  on  the \nbasis of intense consultation with the affected communities. As an appraisal condition for future \ntranches,  the  IPDF  and  relevant  IPDPs  in  English  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  The \nIPDF and IPDPs in local languages will be disclosed in the APs\u2019 communities.   \n\nFinances  and  Schedules.  The  IPDF  mandates  that  each  stand-alone  IPDP  will  detail \n\n20.  Monitoring and Evaluation. PMUs  will  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on  IPDP \nimplementation. The EA will report to ADB quarterly. External monitoring will be assigned to an \nindependent agency by the EA and external monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB once a \nyear.  At  the  end  of  project  implementation  the  independent  monitoring  agency  will  carry  out  a \ngeneral evaluation of IPDP implementation. \n \n21. \nbudgets and provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12       69   \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \nA. \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement?  \n\nN/A  \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis                                    \n\nProposed Classification: General intervention \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan:  \nMajor interventions in the energy sector are designed to achieve economic progress through infrastructure \ndevelopment. Both physical investment support and sector reform are necessary so that the benefits from economic \ngrowth will accrue to the poor.  \n \nBy expanding transmission capacity, the proposed Investment Program is expected to result in quality and reliable \ndelivery of services to consumers, particularly benefiting commercial, residential, and agricultural customers in the \nregion.  \n \nPoor and vulnerable consumers, including social utilities such as hospitals and schools, are often the hardest hit by \ninadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. They will benefit directly from the subprojects. Direct \npositive economic and social benefits will result from the Investment Program.  \n \nA positive, direct impact on local labor is expected during implementation and an indirect impact will be due to the \nincreased income-earning opportunities generated by increased access to electricity and job opportunities during \nconstruction. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nProject preparatory technical assistance consultants have prepared a social impact assessment and a poverty impact \nassessment. A socioeconomic survey was undertaken to provide a basis for the assessments.  \n \nGrid-sourced power will have productive use, as it will substitute for wood, kerosene, and candles, usually at lower \ncosts. After the first 3 years of operations, total benefits will be in the range of $200,000\u2013$250,000 added value \nthrough production or services. Approximately 250 persons will generate additional income for tranche 1 subprojects. \n \nMost poor people in Pakistan are wage labourers or are self-employed. Over 40% of them live close to the poverty line; \nthis indicates that shocks, such as illness, death or drought, have the potential to drive large numbers into poverty. \nMost are landless and less likely to have access to a health clinic or to send their children to school than those with \nhigher incomes. A disruption of their daily routine makes them more vulnerable than other groups as they do not have \nthe resources to insure against such disruptions. \n \nThe Investment Program is expected to create new full-time employment opportunities in civil works. Improved power \nsupplies will induce light industrial and commercial activity, creating employment and improving the productivity and \nquality of outputs in manufacturing and agriculture sectors.   \n \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nStakeholder analysis has been undertaken. All stakeholders have been actively involved, in order to reduce the \nlikelihood of grievances and to ensure that benefits are distributed fairly. In addition, for the selection of unskilled labor \nin the project area, the contractors will consult with local township labor officials, local village leaders and jirgas and will \nalso ensure that labor is hired on a nondiscriminatory basis.   \n \n \nD. \nGender and Development   \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nThe poor and women were included in participatory activities.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\nParticipation Process \n\n   Yes               \n\n    Yes  \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nSignificant/ \nNot significant/ \nNone \n \n Significant \n\nNot significant \n\n None \n \n \n Significant \n\nNot significant \n\n None \n\n \n Significant \n\nNot significant \n\n None \n\n \n Significant \n\nNot significant \n\n None \n \n Significant \n\nNot significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem   \n\nResettlement \n \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\n \nLabor \n \n\nAffordability \n \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nThe proposed subprojects involve the construction of high-\nvoltage transmission lines and substations.

However, an indigenous \npeoples development framework was prepared to cover \nany impact that the subprojects, under future tranches, \nmay have. \n \n \nPositive impacts are expected. The subprojects will require \nconstruction labor and will result in permanent employment \nfor the operation and maintenance of project facilities. \n\n \nThe subprojects are unlikely to result in increased prices of \ngoods and services accessed by the poor.  \n\n \nNo other significant risks were identified. \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n \n Full \n Short \n None \n\n \n Yes \n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n  No \n\n \nNot \nrequired \n \n\n \n Yes \n  No \n\n \nNot \nrequired \n\n \n Yes \n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 13 November 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n \n", "PRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "$0.0165 \nPRs60.72 \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADF \nCPPA \nEA \nEAD \nEAF \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nEPA \nFFA \nFIRR \nGDP \nIA \nICB \nIEE \nIEI \nIPDF \nIPP \nJBIC \nKESC \nKIBOR \nLAR \nLIBOR \nMFF \nMOF \nMOWP \nMTDF \nNCB \nNEPRA \nNTDC \nOCR \nPC-1 \nP-EPA \nPEPCO \nPFR \nPMU \nPPIB \nQCBS \nSIEE \nSVC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nCentral Power Purchasing Agency  \nexecuting agency \nEconomic Affairs Division \nenvironmental assessment framework \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nEnvironmental Protection Agency \nframework financing agreement \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nInnovation and Efficiency Initiative \nIndigenous Peoples Development Framework \nindependent power plant  \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nKarachi Electric Supply Company \nKarachi interbank offered rate \nland acquisition and resettlement \nLondon interbank offered rate \nmultitranche financing facility \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Water and Power \nMedium-Term Development Framework \nnational competitive bidding \nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority \nNational Transmission and Despatch Company \nordinary capital resources \nPlanning Commission \nProvincial Environmental Protection Agency   \nPakistan Electric Power Company  \nperiodic financing request \nproject management unit \nPrivate Power and Infrastructure Board \nquality- and cost-based selection \nsummary initial environmental examination \nstatic var compensator \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "TA \nTOR \nUoSC \nWACC \nWAPDA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "technical assistance \nterms of reference \nuse of system charge \nweighted average cost of capital \nWater and Power Development Authority \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "GWh \nkm  \nkV \nMW \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "gigawatt-hour (1,000 megawatt-hours) \nkilometer (1,000 meters) \nkilovolt (1,000 volts) \nmegawatt (1,000 kilowatts) \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies runs from 1 July to 30 \nJune of the following year.
