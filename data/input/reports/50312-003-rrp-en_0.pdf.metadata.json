The report also describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be \nprovided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF)1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility (CEFPF) for the Railway Rolling Stock Operations Improvement Project and, if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  proposed  a  project  for  financing  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  improve  the  operational  efficiency  of  the  Bangladesh  Railway \nthrough  the  procurement  of  modern  rolling  stock,  prepare  investment  projects  to  enhance  its \nrolling  stock  maintenance  capacity  and  support  the  ongoing  railway  reform.  The  project  will \ncontribute to an increase in the share of the railway as a core mode of transportation and to the \nshift from roads to rail. This modal shift and the efficient rolling stock will reduce carbon dioxide \n(CO2) emission. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nTransport  sector  overview.  The  Bangladeshi  transport  system  consists  of  roads, \n3. \nrailways, inland waterways, seaports for maritime shipping, and civil aviation facilities that cater \nto both domestic and international traffic. Historically, the railway enjoyed a monopoly as a carrier \nand  transported  most  principal  commodities,  including  cement,  coal,  fertilizer,  raw  jute,  stone, \nfood grain, and sugar cane. However, the railway began losing market share, declining from 30% \nin 1975 to a mere 4% in 2015 for both passenger and freight transports. By 2015, road transport \nhad become dominant, carrying over 70% of passenger traffic and 60% of freight traffic.2 The drop \nin the market share of the railway as a carrier is the result of the long-term inadequate investment \nin  railway  infrastructure  and  operational  improvement  of  Bangladesh  Railway,  causing \ninconvenient and unreliable operations and uncomfortable experiences for passengers. \n \nRailway  as  a  sustainable  transport  system.  While  there  has  been  significant \n4. \nunderinvestment  in  the  railway  infrastructure,  road  infrastructure  has  received  significant \ninvestment. This is because the initial cost of investment in the road infrastructure per kilometer \n(km) is generally lower than in the railway infrastructure.3 However, once demands exceed the \nexisting road capacity, expansions tend to be financially and socially costly, especially in densely \npopulated  areas  owing  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  requirements.  The  government \nrecognizes the virtues of the railway as a cheaper, safer, and fuel-efficient transportation mode. \nIt has the potential for greater speed and the capacity to provide demand-responsive sustainable \ndevelopment along core economic corridors without taking much land area if properly planned \nand developed. In  its  Seventh Five-Year  Plan, fiscal  year (FY)  2016\u2013FY2020, the government \nplaced special emphasis on railway development and set targets to increase railway market share \nfrom 4% to 15% in freight transport, from 10% to 15% in container transport between Dhaka and \nChittagong  Port,  and  from  4%  to  10%  in  passenger  transport  by  2020  through  prioritized \ninvestment in railway infrastructure (footnote 2). \n \n\n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015. Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020. Dhaka. \n3  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n\n\fNetwork  capacity  insufficient  for  traffic  demands.  Network  capacity  augmentation \n5. \nprogress has been marginal. Since 2006, only about 120 track km (about 3%) have been added \nto  the  network.  In  its  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2016\u2013FY2020  (footnote  2),  the  government \ntargets the construction of 856 km of new rail tracks, expediting efforts to augment the capacity \nof the railway network. Additional fleets are required for use in the enhanced network. \n \n6. \nRolling  stock  unavailable  for  efficient  operations.  An  adequate  number  of  effective \nrolling  stock  should  be  available  for  efficient  railway  operations.  Bangladesh  Railway  had  278 \ndiesel locomotives, 1,249 coaching vehicles, and 8,677 freight wagons at the end of FY2016.4 \nHowever, majority of rolling stock are aged over 30 years, most of which exceeds their economic \nlives. The old rolling stock is no longer reliable to operate, experiencing frequent malfunctions. In \nthe  course  of  revising  its  master  plan,  Bangladesh  Railway  identified  the  need  to  procure 197 \nlocomotives, 1,492 coaches, and 2,202 wagons by 2025.5 \n \n7. \nInadequate  conditions  of  rolling  stock  maintenance  facilities.  The  maintenance \nfacilities  of  Bangladesh  Railway  have  not  been  improved  as  required  over  time.  Bangladesh \nRailway owns four maintenance workshops and 10 maintenance sheds for locomotives, and two \nmaintenance workshops and 14 maintenance depots for coaches and wagons. These facilities \nare not adequately equipped with the necessary machinery, maintenance parts, and staff, and \nare unable to attend to the prescribed maintenance cycles of rolling stock. A significant number \nof special repair needs\u2014owing to frequent breakdowns of timeworn rolling stock\u2014is an added \nburden to these maintenance facilities, further hampering timely and quality maintenance. While \nBangladesh Railway realizes the urgent need for enhancing maintenance facilities,  it lacks the \ninstitutional knowledge to prepare investment projects for such purpose.  \n \n8. \nReform  needs  of  the  Bangladesh  Railway.  Sound  financial  performance  is  a  key  to \nsustainable  railway  operations,  but  the  performance  of  Bangladesh  Railway  has  not  been \nencouraging.  Its  average  operating  ratio  (operating  expenses  divided  by  operating  revenues) \nbetween  FY2007  and  FY2016  is  214%,  showing  operating  cost  is  about  double  the  operating \nrevenue. The government has provided sufficient subsidies for Bangladesh Railway to sustain its \noperations and railway reform has been in progress to foster the Bangladesh Railway as a robust \ngoing concern. A major cause of Bangladesh Railway\u2019s unsatisfactory revenue performance has \nbeen  the  historically  low  level  of  passenger  and  freight  tariffs,  which  had  been  frozen  by  the \ngovernment for  decades. Increases both  in the railway  network  capacity and in the  number  of \noperational  rolling  stock  will  generate  more  revenues  through  capturing  the  market  demand \nsuppressed  by  capacity  constraints.  While  the  timely  consolidation  of  accurate  management \ninformation  and  preparation  of  precise  financial  statements  are  prerequisites  for  effective \nbusiness planning, Bangladesh Railway lacks the required tools and resources for this. \n \n9. \nADB\u2019s assistance to Bangladesh Railway. ADB has been engaged with Bangladesh \nRailway to support the government initiatives to develop the railway as a sustainable transport \nsystem of the country. Since 2006 and starting with the Railway Sector Investment Program, ADB \nhas  provided  four  loans  to  the  government  with  the  total  amount  of  $2,811  million.6 The  three \npillars  of  ADB\u2019s  support  have  been  network  capacity  improvement,  operational  capacity \nimprovement, and railway reform implementation. \n\n                                                \n4  Bangladesh Railway. 2017.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \n10. \nNetwork  capacity  improvement.  ADB  has  provided  three  loans  to  invest  in  network \ncapacity  enhancement  since  2006.  ADB\u2019s  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program  (footnote  6) \nfinanced the double tracking of the 64 km Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar section of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \ncorridor, and the extension of loop lines and modernization of signaling in the Ishurdi\u2013Darsana \nsection.  In  2014,  ADB  approved  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Railway \nConnectivity: Akhaura\u2013Laksam Double Track Project to upgrade the 72-km section of the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong corridor to a double track railway line with modern signaling equipment.7 In 2016, ADB \napproved the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar Railway \nProject Phase 1, to construct the 102-km section of the Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar railway corridor.8 \n \n11. \nOperational  capacity  improvement. To improve the quality  of  its  rolling stock  assets, \nsince 2006, Bangladesh Railway has procured 46 locomotives, 269 coaching vehicles, and 645 \nfreight  wagons.  This  includes  the  procurement  of  150  passenger  carriages  under  the  ADB-\nsupported Railway Sector Investment Program (footnote 6). The procurement of 264 passenger \ncarriages,  10  locomotives,  and  additional  maintenance  equipment  is  ongoing  under  the  ADB-\nsupported Railway Rolling Stock Project, approved in 2015. The project completion is expected \nin 2020 as planned.9 Furthermore, procurement of 70 locomotives and 270 passenger carriages \nis ongoing under the Bangladesh Railway\u2019s own budget to replace the oldest rolling stock. \n \nRailway  reform  implementation.  The  Railway  Reform  Project  under  ADB\u2019s  Railway \n12. \nSector  Investment  Program  (footnote  6)  has  supported  the  improvement  of  the  financial \nperformance of Bangladesh Railway. It contributed to the realization of the passenger and freight \ntariff adjustment in FY2013, for the first time since 1992, and the establishment of tariff adjustment \nformula allowing annual tariff adjustments by the Ministry of Railways. The first tariff adjustment \nbased on this formula was made in February 2016, and the continued annual tariff adjustments \nare expected to gradually raise the operating revenue. The focus of the operating cost reduction \nis on the maintenance cost, representing 32.16%, and the fuel cost, representing 16.23% of total \noperating  expenses  in  FY2016.  Replacement  of  timeworn  rolling  stock  and  improved \nmaintenance facilities will reduce the unit cost of rolling stock maintenance. The introduction of \nmodern fuel-efficient locomotives will bring down the fuel cost of each train. For the preparation \nof  timely  and  accurate management  information  and  precise financial  statements, the  Railway \nReform  Project  supported  the  development  of  an  enterprise  resource  planning  information \ntechnology (ERPIT) system. The railway reform agenda are being implemented consistently to \nachieve the self-sustainable operations of Bangladesh Railway.10 \n \nConsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy.  To  promote  economic \n13. \ndiversification and enhance the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential, ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020,  emphasizes  the  importance  of  easing  infrastructure \nconstraints  by  undertaking  transformational  investments  and  promoting  policy  reforms  in  key \nsectors such as energy, transport, and urban development as a priority investment area.11 ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fcountry  operations  business  plan  for  Bangladesh,  2017\u20132019,  includes  loan  projects  for  the \ninvestment  on  rolling  stock  and  network  capacity  augmentation  as  a  means  to  achieve  the \nstrategic objective.12 \n \nLessons learned. ADB\u2019s previous interventions in Bangladesh Railway have often faced \n14. \nstart-up  delays  in  project  implementation.  The  main  cause  of  delays  for  the  rolling  stock \nimprovement  projects  has  been  in  the  procurement  process  of  the  suppliers.  During  the \npreparation of the project, ADB has supported the early preparation of bidding documents with \nnonrestrictive technical specifications and unambiguous technical evaluation criteria to facilitate \nthe  bidding  process.  Furthermore,  with  the  continued  loan  assistance for  Bangladesh  Railway \nprojects  since  2006,  Bangladesh  Railway  has  gradually  gained  the  institutional  knowledge  for \nproject  implementation.  This  has  enabled  the  establishment  of  a  project  implementation  unit \nstaffed with officials experienced in ADB projects. \n \n15. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  assistance  in  rolling  stock  will  increase  the \noperational capacity of Bangladesh Railway. The rolling stock to be procured under the project \nwill include 40 locomotives equipped with auxiliary power unit (APU), which will be introduced for \nthe  first  time  into  the  Bangladesh  Railway.  APU  will  significantly  reduce  the  diesel  fuel \nconsumption of locomotives during idling time. The effect of APU has been proven internationally \nand,  in  the  case  of  the  Indian  Railways  in  India,  a  neighboring  country  of  Bangladesh,  APU \nconsumed about 85% less diesel fuel per hour than the main engine did during idling time. The \nfuel cost savings will contribute to the improvement of the financial performance of Bangladesh \nRailway and the reduction of CO2 emission. The attached TA to be financed by the ACEF (footnote \n1)  under  the  CEFPF  will  further  enhance  the  effects  of  the  new  technology  by  improving  the \ncapacity  of  Bangladesh Railway  staff  on the  energy-efficient  rolling  stock  operations,  including \nthe use of APU-equipped locomotives. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) a balanced 3R (rail, river, and road)- \nbased multimodal transport infrastructure system developed (footnote 2), and (ii) greenhouse gas \nemissions  in  the  power,  transport,  and  industry  sectors  reduced. 13 The  project  will  have  the \nfollowing outcome: operational and energy efficiency of Bangladesh Railway improved.14 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n17. \nOutput  1:  Modern  rolling  stock  procured.  The  project  will  procure  40  broad  gauge \nlocomotives,  125  luggage  vans  for  passenger  and  parcel  trains,  and  1,000  wagons  for  freight \ntrains for use in the major corridors of the Bangladesh Railway network. \n \n18. \nOutput  2:  Investment  plans  for  maintenance  facilities  of  locomotives  and  diesel \nelectric  multiple  units  developed.  The  consulting  services  under  the  project  will  prepare \ninvestment plans of urgently required maintenance facilities (feasibility studies, detailed designs, \ncost estimates, and bidding documents). \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  Bangladesh  Railway  officials  and  locomotive  drivers  on \nenergy-efficient  rolling  stock  operations  improved.  The  project  will  establish  a  training \nprogram  and  train  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  locomotive  drivers  on  the  effective  use  of  new \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2016.

A team of information technology (IT) engineers \nwill be engaged under the project to (i) provide daily operational support to the users of the ERPIT \nsystem, and (ii) operate and maintain the ERPIT system and its infrastructure developed under \nADB\u2019s Railway Sector Investment Program (footnote 6). Bangladesh Railway intends to establish \nan IT cell to operate and maintain the system.

While there is \nno  precedent  use  of  APU  in  Bangladesh,  an  assessment  by  Indian  Railways,  for  instance, \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\findicates that only 43% of potential APU operation hours are utilized due to inadequate operations \nby locomotive drivers. Because of their lack of confidence in this new unit,  it is often observed \nthat locomotive drivers switch off APU to avoid unexpected failures in locomotive operations. The \nTA will provide training to locomotive drivers to maximize the usage of APU in accordance with \nthe supplier\u2019s operations manual. It will include the support for Bangladesh Railway to establish \nthe  training  program  with  the  preparations  of  training  materials  based  on  which  Bangladesh \nRailway will be able to train its locomotive drivers after the proposed project; keeping pace with \nthe  increase  in  APU-equipped  locomotives  in  the  future.  In  addition,  as  a  policy  direction  for \nBangladesh  Railway\u2019s  management,  the TA  will  recommend  potential  solutions  to  improve the \noverall energy efficiency of rolling stock operations.16 \n \n28. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ACEF (footnote \n1) under the CEFPF and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. Bangladesh Railway \nwill be the executing agency for the TA, which will be implemented from January 2019 to October \n2019  with 22  person-months  input (13  international,  9  national).    An international firm  shall  be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). The quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality: cost ratio of 90:10 \nand bio-data technical proposals will be used for this recruitment. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n29. \nThe project will finance the procurement of railway rolling stock in line with international \ndesign  standards.  The  technical  specifications  of  the  rolling  stock  have  been  prepared  in \nconformity  with the  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  network  capacity.  Rolling stock  supply  contracts  will \ninclude  the  preparation  of  operation  and  maintenance  manuals.  The  detailed  designs  of \nlocomotive  maintenance  facilities  will  be  prepared  to  ensure  the  early  improvement  of \nmaintenance facilities for the sustainable maintenance of locomotives procured under the project. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \n30. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines by comparing lifecycle costs in with- and without- project cases, \nusing a 9% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria.17 \nThe project is expected to deliver significant benefits through savings in fuel, maintenance costs, \nand travel time resulting from increased reliability and improved operational efficiency, savings in \nvehicle operating  costs from  avoided road travel,  and  reduction  in greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe EIRR of the project is estimated at 14.5%. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate \nthe economic viability of the project with the following adverse changes in costs and benefits: (i) \ncapital costs increased by 10%, (ii) benefits reduced by 10%, (iii) capital costs increased by 10% \nand benefits reduced by 10%, (iv) fuel savings decreased by 20%, (v) travel time savings reduced \nby 50%, and (vi) CO2 emission reduction excluded from the benefits. In all scenarios, the EIRR of \nthe project remains above 9%, demonstrating the project\u2019s robustness. The most sensitive factor \nwas a 50% reduction in travel time savings, which decreases the EIRR to 11.1%. \n \n31. \nFinancial analysis. The financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines. 18  The  project  is  estimated  to  reduce  operating  costs  and  generate \n                                                \n16 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2017.

The weighted average cost of capital of the project \nwas  estimated  at  1.81%.  Based  on  the  existing  system-wide  costs  and  revenues,  and  on  the \nassumption that passenger and freight tariffs would increase annually at a real rate of 1.5%, the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  project  was  estimated  at  3.2%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nunderscores the need for continuous annual adjustments of railway tariffs and for achieving the \ntarget traffic volumes with the new rolling stock. The analysis also demonstrated that incremental \nrevenues  of  the  project  remain  higher  than  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs, \nimproving the overall operating ratio of Bangladesh Railway over the analysis period. \n \n32. \nFinancial  sustainability.  As  the  operating  expenses  of  Bangladesh  Railway  between \nFY2007 and FY2016 have been consistently higher than its revenues, the government continues \nto provide adequate budgetary support to sustain operations and to fully finance the funding gap. \nIn light of the systemic importance of Bangladesh Railway, the continued budgetary support is \nreasonably expected. The project is considered as financially sustainable. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management.  A \n\nfinancial  management  assessment  concluded \n\n33. \nthat \nBangladesh  Railway  has  adequate  capacity  to  undertake  the  financial  management  of  ADB-\nfinanced projects. Bangladesh Railway has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects.  It  has  knowledge  of  project  financial  accounting  methods  and  ADB  disbursement \nprocedures. Its staff have participated in workshops on financial management and sharing of good \npractices organized by ADB. Its capacity is being strengthened by mainstreaming the use of the \nERPIT system. The overall project financial management risk is moderate. \n \n34. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). ADB will review documents \nand  submissions  related  to  procurement  in  all  major  milestones  prior  to  proceeding  with  the \nprocurement process. The assessment of the procurement capacity of Bangladesh Railway has \nconcluded that it has a reasonable capacity to undertake procurement activities under the project. \nA  project  implementation  unit  will  be  established  under  Bangladesh  Railway  and  staffed  by \nofficials adequately experienced in rolling stock procurement. ADB has engaged a consultant to \nassist  Bangladesh  Railway  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  bidding  process.  The  overall \nprocurement risk is moderate. \n \nNational  procurement  regulations  have  improved  through  the  Public  Procurement  Act, \n35. \n2006, and through the related Public Procurement Rules (2008), with subsequent amendments \nand  the  establishment  of  the  Central  Procurement  Technical  Unit  under  the  Implementation \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning.  In  October  2012,  a  National \nIntegrity Strategy (NIS) was approved and a National Integrity Advisory Committee was formed, \nchaired by the Prime Minister, to oversee the anticorruption activities and implement the strategy. \nNIS includes a road map for strengthening both the state and non-state accountability institutions \nto  fight  corruption  and  improve  governance.  Under  NIS,  all  line  ministries  and  key  watchdog \ninstitutions have formed ethics committees and appointed focal points to implement corruption-\nprevention programs and actions. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed  with the government  and  Bangladesh  Railway.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n36. \nThe  most  important  project  beneficiaries  are  the  train  users,  both  passengers  of  all \nticketed  classes  and  freight  transportation  users.  Although  not  directly  targeting  the  poor,  the \nproject will support their mobility needs, since the railway remains an affordable, comfortable, and \nreliable mode of transport.  Women will particularly benefit from the project as prominent railway \nusers. Since 2014, ADB has engaged with Bangladesh Railway in proactively integrating gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  elements  in  two  ADB-financed  projects. 19 As  part  of  the  policy \ndialogue, opportunities to further engage with Bangladesh Railway on organizational aspects of \ngender  mainstreaming  will  be  explored,  with  the  aim  of  instituting  gender-related  business \nprocesses and practices. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n37. \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \nEnvironment (category C). The project mainly involves the procurement of railway rolling \n38. \nstock that will operate on existing railway lines. The preparation of the design of the maintenance \nfacilities will include conducting environmental assessments. This has already been included in \nthe  terms  of  reference  of  the  consulting  services.  A  review  of  environmental  implications  as \nrequired for environment category C projects has been carried out and its findings show that there \nwill be no adverse environmental impacts during project implementation. After the completion of \nthe project, a net benefit in CO2 emission reductions is expected from the shift of passengers and \nfreight from road to rail and the use of more energy-efficient locomotives equipped with APU. \n \n39. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The project mainly involves the procurement of \nrailway  rolling  stock.  The  preparation  of  the  design  of  the  maintenance  facilities  will  include \nconducting the due diligence of involuntary resettlement impacts. This has been included in the \nterms of reference of the consulting services. \n \n40. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  mainly  involves  the  procurement  of \nrailway rolling stock, and the preparation of the design of the maintenance facilities will include \nconducting due diligence of indigenous peoples impacts. This has been included in the terms of \nreference of the consulting services. \n \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n41. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n\n \n\n                                                \n19 South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Railway  Connectivity:  Akhaura\u2013Laksam  Double  Track  Project \n(footnote 7) and South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Chittagong-Cox\u2019s Bazar Railway Project, Phase 1 \n(footnote 8) are categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.
