I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for (i) a proposed loan \nof up to $75 million; and (ii) proposed administration of a loan of up to $15 million to be provided by \nthe Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility, both to Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC (AGL) for the Adjaristsqali Hydropower \nProject in Georgia.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Georgia has made significant progress in energy sector reforms over the past 10 years \nsince 2003 to address chronic power shortages and the poor financial condition of electricity and \ngas companies. Until 2006, the country\u2019s electricity demand surpassed total supply, so the balance \nneeded to be imported. However, in 2007, supply exceeded total demand as a result of the \nGovernment of Georgia\u2019s effort to increase the generation capacity of hydropower plants, and \nGeorgia has since become an electricity exporter.2 While Georgia imports electricity in winter when \nsupply  is  low,  it  has  significant  excess generation  in  summer,  and  the  volume  of  exports  is \nincreasing each year. In view of its rich but underdeveloped hydro resources, Georgia has set a \nstrategic goal to become a regional energy hub by trading energy with neighboring countries. \nAmong others, Turkey is the most attractive given its peak demand in summer (when demand in \nGeorgia is lower), projected capacity shortfall, and higher electricity market prices. The government \nis hence promoting development of new hydropower plants. The proposed project is the second \nprivate hydropower plant designed for energy export and the first to be financed on a limited \nrecourse basis. \n \n3.  In March 2013, Tata Power Company Limited (Tata Power) and Clean Energy Invest (CEI \nand, collectively with Tata Power, the sponsors), approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto request a loan for the project. Such request was made based on ADB\u2019s long partnership history \nwith  Tata  Power  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and  ADB\u2019s  experience  in \nfinancing private hydropower projects. The project team also had a preliminary discussion with the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which was also approached by the \nsponsors. Through these initial discussions, the Private Sector Operations Department believed \nthat  the  project  possesses  sound  fundamentals,  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  bring  significant \ndevelopmental benefits and demonstration impact, financing from ADB is absolutely necessary to \nmake the project happen, and the success of the project will send an important signal to the market \nand help build confidence for private sector participation in Georgia\u2019s hydropower development and \ncross-border energy trade. \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project involves the construction, operation, and maintenance of two separate run-of-\nriver hydropower plants operating in a cascade with a total capacity of 185 megawatts (MW). The \nproject facilities include one weir on the Chirukhistsqali River, two dams with reservoirs on the \nAdjaristsqali River and Skhalta River, three tunnels with a total length of 32.7 kilometers, and two \nhydropower plants. The main hydropower plant will be constructed on the Adjaristsqali River near \nShuakhevi village utilizing water collected from the Chirukhistsqali, Skhalta, and Adjaristsqali rivers; \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia. 2010. Energy Sector of Georgia. Tbilisi. \n ", "2 \nand a small hydropower plant will be constructed at Skhalta village utilizing water diverted from the \nChirukhistsqali River. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n5.  The borrower is Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC (AGL), a special purpose vehicle to be owned by \nCEI, Tata Power, and IFC.  \n \n6.  CEI was established in 2010 as a single purpose company to develop the project.  \n7.  Tata Power is India\u2019s largest integrated power corporation in the private sector. While most \nof its operations are in India, it is planning to expand overseas business. It is also increasing clean \nenergy investments, with a target of 20%\u201325% of its portfolio by 2020. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n8.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  provide  further  impetus  to  hydropower \ndevelopment in Georgia by catalyzing more private sector investment and increasing cross-border \nenergy  trading  in  the  region.  Georgia  has  rich  hydropower  resources,  and  successful \nimplementation of the project will not only act as a template for further hydropower development \nbut also foster confidence among potential investors and lenders and promote further private \nsector investment in the country\u2019s hydropower sector overall. This will help alleviate the country\u2019s \ndependence on imported fossil fuel through the utilization of clean and sustainable indigenous \nwater resources. Low-cost surplus energy can be exported to neighboring countries\u2014increasing \nenergy trade in the region, and fostering regional cooperation and integration. The project will also \ngenerate additional revenues for Georgia through energy trade with Turkey. The government\u2019s \nearnings  from  royalties  and  taxes  related  to  energy  export  can  be  used  for  other  priority \nexpenditures of Georgia to promote economic growth and improve social services. \n \n2.  Outcome  \n9.  The project\u2019s outcome is increased production and export of hydropower. The project will \nproduce the additional electricity of 450 gigawatt-hours per annum from 2017 onward. The project \nwill avoid greenhouse gas emissions equal to 200,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) per year of \n2\noperation. Furthermore, revenue of $67.9 million is expected for the government through royalties \nand  indirect  taxes,  which  can  be  used for  other  priority  expenditures  of Georgia  to  promote \neconomic growth and improve social services. \n \n3.  Outputs \n10.  The output is the construction and successful commissioning of a 185 MW hydropower \nproject by 2017. The plant is expected to create local employment opportunities in excess of 600 \njobs during construction and over 50 jobs after commissioning in southern Georgia, an area of \nparticular development concern to ADB. \n \n ", "3 \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n11.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 The project addresses two of the three \nstrategic agendas of Strategy 2020\u2014environmentally sustainable growth and regional cooperation \nand integration. \n \n12.  The  first  country  partnership  strategy  for  Georgia  is  being  prepared.  Meanwhile,  ADB \noperations in the country continue to be guided by the interim operational strategy, 2008\u20132009, \nwhich has identified ADB\u2019s operational priorities consistent with the government\u2019s development \nagenda.4 Development and utilization of the considerable domestic hydropower potential is a top \npriority.  Georgia  has  significant  renewable  energy  resources,  especially  hydropower  and \ngeothermal. The project will strengthen Georgia\u2019s energy security by adding more generating \ncapacity using its indigenous hydro resource, particularly during the winter months when there are \ndomestic energy supply shortfalls. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n13.  The project is fully consistent with the ADB Energy Policy (2009), which promotes effective \nregional cooperation and integration in the energy sector to strengthen energy security. The policy \nstresses the importance of harnessing energy efficiency, which is essential to improve energy \nsecurity and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.  \n \nTable 3: Summary Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The build\u2013own\u2013operate (BOO) agreement is between the Ministry of Energy and Natural \nResources of Georgia, Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC (AGL), and its shareholders. Under the \nBOO agreement, the government allows AGL to develop the project on a BOO basis for \nthe duration of plant life (20 years) plus a 4-year construction period. The BOO agreement \nprovides such terms as priority access to the transmission lines, usage of water, and other \nrights and obligations of AGL and the government during the construction and operations \nphases that are typical for a project of this type. \n \nManagement  Supervised  by  Clean  Energy  Invest  (CEI)  and  Tata  Power;  Tata  Power  has  over \n8,500 megawatts  (MW) of  power  development  and operational  experience,  including \nrenewables and cross-border hydropower. CEI has extensive knowledge and skill sets in \nthe engineering and operation of hydropower plants. \n \nConstruction Arrangements \nType of arrangement  The  project  will  be  executed  under  two  separate  contracts  of  civil  works  and \nelectromechanical  works,  both  of  which  have  been  awarded  following  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  detailed  design  and  supervision  will  be  provided  by \nMott MacDonald from the United Kingdom, the owner\u2019s engineer. New transmission lines \nto evacuate electricity from the project will be the responsibility of the government. \n \nOperations Arrangements \nRevenue structure  The project is designed as a day-peak plant. Its power will be evacuated using a 60 \nkilometer 220 kilovolt transmission line to Batumi, after which it will be sold to the Turkish \n                                                      \n3  ADB. 2008.

For the remaining 3 months, the electricity will be sold in \nGeorgia to either private distribution companies or to the Electricity System Commercial \nOperator at the best available price. However, after the first 10 years of operation, AGL \nwill be free to sell all its power in the Turkish market. \n \nOperation and maintenance  To be undertaken by AGL, with assistance from Tata Power. \n \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, compliance with \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard requirements, construction progress, updates, \nand financial performance during operation, will be reported by AGL and monitored by \nADB and other lenders.  \n \nSource: Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n15.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance will have two components: (i) a loan of up to $75 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) administration of a loan of up to $15 million to be \nprovided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility.6 The loans will have a tenor of up to 18 years, including a grace \nperiod of up to 4 years, and will be repaid semiannually. They will carry respective interest rates as \nwell as commitment and front-end fees to be determined and/or endorsed by ADB\u2019s investment \ncommittee. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n16.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  The project will promote regional cooperation and integration, and will generate \nadditional revenues for Georgia through energy trade with Turkey. \n(ii)  The project will strengthen Georgia\u2019s energy security by adding more generating \ncapacity using its domestic clean energy resource. \n(iii)  ADB will provide critical gap financing for successful implementation of the project, \nwhich is not readily available in the market. The nature of the project (e.g., long \nconstruction period, high up-front capital expenditure, competitive tariffs assuming a \nlong asset life) is appropriately financed by long-tenor debt to match the cash-flow \nprofile. \n(iv)  Once  approved,  this  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector  loan  for  development  of \nGeorgia\u2019s energy sector as well as the first nonsovereign cofinancing by  ADB, \nEBRD, and IFC in Georgia\u2019s energy sector. \n(v)  ADB  will  support  and  promote  private  sector  investments  between  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries. \n \n                                                      \n6  As the implementing entity, ADB disburses the funds which it has received from the Canadian Climate Fund for the \nPrivate Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The fund will assume all credit risks on \nthe principal and interest repayments related to the loan. As such, this loan will not count as ADB exposure to the \nproject. (ADB. 2010. Exposure and Investment Limitations on Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM \nD13/BP. Manila). \n ", "5 \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n17.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory A for environment, category A for involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous \npeoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. AGL will implement extra measure to \nallay concerns of villagers around the project sites regarding the potential effect of tunneling and \nconstruction related activities triggering new landslides, potential loss of water supply (groundwater \nor springs), and impacts of construction on traffic. The institutional capacity and commitment of \nAGL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental risks are deemed adequate, and measures \nare  being  continually  improved  such  as  better  coordination  of  activities  with  its  contractors. \nInformation disclosure and consultations with affected people are conducted in accordance with \nADB requirements.7 A national environmental and social impact assessment was approved under \nGeorgian national regulations. Another assessment was prepared to meet the lenders\u2019 safeguard \nrequirements, and was disclosed on the ADB website on 27 June 2013. An environmental and \nsocial management plan was prepared, including a series of management plans as part of the \nconstruction environmental management plan. Contractors will also develop environment, health \nand safety plans in accordance with the construction environmental management plan. To ensure \nproper  risk  mitigation,  AGL  and  its  contractors  will  implement  these  and  incorporate  specific \nmeasures to address stakeholders\u2019 concerns. The environmental and social compliance audit on \nadvance  works  showed  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  management  measures.  The \nenvironmental and social impact assessment for the transmission line is expected to be conducted \naccording to Georgian and World Bank requirements since the government approached the World \nBank to finance the facility. \n \n18.  While no protected areas will be impacted by the project, a biodiversity action plan was \ndeveloped in consultation with multiple stakeholders. Spoils during construction of tunnels, dams, \nadits, and other civil works will be used in concrete production, as road aggregate, or disposed of \nin spoil dumps. Some 10% of annual mean flow was initially set as part of a two-stage approach to \nenvironmental flow assessment. A second stage will be implemented to identify sensitive riverine \nmesohabitats, determine reach-specific flow requirements, and establish measures as part of an \nadaptive management approach. Physical cultural resources have been avoided and AGL has \ndeveloped chance find procedures.8 Public consultations and stakeholder workshops have been \nconducted. Concerns regarding road damage caused by vehicles and equipment transport, and \npotential reduction in supply from water resources, were identified in the community meetings and \nsafeguard planning as well as through the grievance redress mechanism. Measures to address \nthese  concerns  are  in  place  and  will  be  implemented  as  needed.  AGL  has  established  an \nenvironmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  unit  responsible for  managing  safeguard  issues.  An \nemergency preparedness and response plan with emphasis on road safety, landslide risks, and \nfluctuating river flow will also be prepared. \n \n19.  An  independent  expert  assessment  was  conducted  to  address  the  concerns  villagers \nraised. It showed that geological studies were done in a professional manner and construction \nactivities are not expected to induce landslides of the same magnitude as those occurred in the \narea in the past. The same is expected with tunneling works if safe blasting methodology is \n                                                      \n7  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8 The chance find procedures are a pre-approved management and conservation approach for materials that may be \ndiscovered during project implementation. \n ", "6 \nimplemented. However, to monitor the impacts of construction activities, AGL will install landslide \nmonitoring stations in the villages. It will also record vibrations caused by blasting and survey, and \nmonitor impacts to houses within 200 meters of the blast center. AGL has inventoried the water \nsources in the villages, and plans to provide temporary or permanent community water supply if \nthese are affected by the tunnels. To manage construction traffic, AGL will engage traffic safety \nwardens stationed in the affected villages to assist with traffic management and provide school \nbuses to ferry schoolchildren. \n \n20.  To  ensure  that  AGL  and  its  contractors  can  effectively  implement  the  management \nmeasures, a communication strategy, including entry protocol to construction sites and briefing on \nenvironmental  and  social  issues  and  mitigation  measures  before  contractors  implement \nconstruction activities, were recommended to be established by the lenders. AGL will also need to \nenhance the technical knowledge of its community liaison officers, and intensify its information \ncampaign by providing visual information materials, fact sheets, and technical briefings to local \npeople  on  geological  risks  and  overall  project  risk  management  measures.  AGL  has  the \ncommitment and sufficient capability to implement the proposed measures. \n \n21.  The land acquisition and livelihood restoration plan is being implemented and an audit \nreport has been prepared. The impact of acquisition of about 44 hectares (ha), including 9 ha \nbelonging to 369 households, entailed economic displacement mainly because of loss of grazing \nland. No physical displacement of affected people is required. The remaining 35 ha is managed by \nthe state. An external review of the land acquisition and livelihood restoration plan implementation \nis being undertaken, and an ADB mission will be fielded to verify and ensure compliance. A \nlivelihood  restoration  program  has  commenced  with  the  training  of  about  600 persons  from \naffected families, of which 166 persons have been engaged either by AGL or contractors. A \ndetailed livelihood restoration program will be prepared and submitted to ADB within 3 months after \nloan signing. Indigenous peoples are not present in the project area. \n \n22.  In 2013, key stakeholder concerns were raised related to the geological risks of tunneling \nworks, which people fear may activate unstable slopes and cause landslides and affect water \nsupply availability. Tsablana (a project-affected village) and Ghurta (located outside the project \narea) have intermittently blocked contractor access to the project sites. AGL has demonstrated its \ncommitment  to  resolve  the  problem  through  intensive  engagement  with  the  government, \nnegotiations,  and  ongoing  dialogue  with  local  villagers,  involving  technical  experts  and \nnongovernment organizations.  \n \n23.  The project is categorized as having no gender elements. Opportunities for creating jobs for \nwomen may be limited, as the tunnel digging and other construction activities may not be suitable \nfor women. The project is expected to provide job opportunities for 600 local people during the \nconstruction  phase.  ADB  will  ensure  that  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate \nprovisions requiring AGL to comply with national labor laws and, in addition, to take specific \nmeasures (including in relation to contractors) in relation to internationally recognized core labor \nstandards for the ADB-financed portion of the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy.9  \n \n24.  Based on the assessment of potential climate change risks, the project can be classified \ninto the medium risk category. Adaptation measures were included to address the residual risks. \nGiven the uncertainty of changes in climate, the ongoing monitoring, adaptive management, and \nmaintenance regime will provide sufficient resilience to the scheme once in operation.10 \n \n                                                      \n9  ADB. 2001.

AGL and the sponsors were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policy relating to anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing.11 Consistent \nwith its commitment to governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require AGL to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering activities, and the \nfinancing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \n \nC.  Assurances \n26.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, the Government \nof Georgia\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to AGL will be obtained. ADB will enter into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of \nthe proposed assistance by the Board. 12 \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n27.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i)  the loan of up to $75,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and  \n(ii) the administration by ADB of the loan of up to $15,000,000 to be provided by the \nCanadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility,  \nboth to Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC for the Adjaristsqali Hydropower Project in Georgia, with such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as \nmay be reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n22 April 2014\n                                                      \n11 ADB. 2003.
