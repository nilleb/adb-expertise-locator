About  half  of \nthe  country\u2019s\npopulation relies on maritime transport, which is currently\nunsafe  and  uneconomic.  The  Project  will  restore  the\nexisting  navigation  aids,  establish  new  aids,  open  new\nchannels,  and  establish  a  national  hydrographic  service\nand an autonomous maritime safety entity. It will improve\nmaritime  safety  by  developing  a  rehabilitated,  efficient,\nand  safe  navigation  system  and  providing \ntimely\ninformation on maritime conditions.\n\nPrimary Classification: Economic growth/Pro-poor\nEnvironmental  Category:  B.

The  Project  will\nsignificantly raise the confidence of mariners navigating in\nPNG coastal waters and enable them to provide improved\ntransportation services at a lower cost and lower risk.\n\nincome  opportunities \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  contributes  to  geographic  integration  of  the\ncountry;  distribution  of  goods  and  services  to  the  rural\npoor; affordability, reliability, and safety in travel along the\ncoastal  areas;  and  development  of  local  markets  and\ntrade with mainstream centers and the outside world. The\nProject  will  (i)  reconstruct  the  network  of  navigation  aids\nto  an  acceptable  international  maritime  standard;  (ii)\nestablish  a  self-reliant  hydrographic  service;  and  (iii)\ninstitutionalize sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of\nthe  navigation  aids,  and  community  programs  that  are\neffective in maintaining the network. The Project includes\nseven  components:  sector  reorganization,  civil  works  for\nthe construction of new navigation aids and  rehabilitation\nof existing aids, equipment for navigation aids, community\nengagement  program,  establishment  of  hydrographic\ninfrastructure, training, and project management.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $30.12  million\nequivalent,  consisting  of  $22.58  million  (75  percent)  in\n\n\fPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 April 2006.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nDepartment of Transport and Civil Aviation (DOTCA)\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\niii\n\nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $7.54  million  equivalent  (25\npercent) in local currency costs.\n\nThe  Project  will  be  financed  by  a  proposed  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loan of $20.60 million1 and the\nGovernment\u2019s own funds of $9.52 million equivalent.\n\n$20.60 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources over\n25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The interest\nrate  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-\nbased variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, a\ncommitment fee of 0.75 percent, and a front-end fee of 1\npercent of the loan amount.\n\nA  project  steering  committee  will  monitor  project\nimplementation.

The sector and the Project have been accorded high priority by\nthe Government.\n\nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  included  a  sector  review  and  a\n3.\nfeasibility  study.  Fact-finding  and  appraisal  were  carried  out  in  March  and  June  2000,  to\nformulate the Project and to carry out policy dialogue on sector issues. This report is based on\nthe feasibility report and the findings of the ADB mission.2 The project framework is in Appendix\n1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nOverview\n\n4.\nPNG occupies the eastern half of New Guinea island and numerous smaller islands. Of\nthese, Bougainville, New Britain, New Ireland, and Manus are the largest. PNG's population of\n4.2  million  is  scattered  and  overwhelmingly  rural:  3.5  million,  or  84  percent,  of  people  live  in\nisolated  villages.  Fourteen  of  the  19  provinces  and  the  national  capital  district  in  PNG  are\ncoastal. The maritime provinces include Bougainville, Central, East and West New Britain, Gulf,\nMadang,  Manus,  Milne  Bay,  Morobe,  New  Ireland,  Oro,  Sandaun,  and  Western.  PNG\u2019s\ncoastline  reaches  about  6,500  kilometers  (km),  much  of  which  is  accessible  only  by  sea.  In\n1990,  12  percent  of  the  population  inhabited  the  island  provinces  and  44  percent  the  coastal\nprovinces.3 Coastal populations have poor access to roads, and communities are often distant\nfrom  airstrips.  Movement  of  goods  and  people  is  primarily  by  sea  for  most  coastal  residents.\nPNG has 17 million hectares of reef-covered coastal waters, making it the largest fishing zone in\nthe Pacific.\n\n5.\nAs  a  small,  open,  island  economy,  PNG  is  dependent  on  maritime  transport  for  the\ndevelopment  of  vital  economic  sectors,  markets, and  social  services.  The  maritime  navigation\naids  system  in  PNG  has  deteriorated  over  the  past  10  years  to  a  state  in  which  maritime\ntransport  is  negatively  affected.  As  a  result  70  of  166  aids  are  nonoperational,  with  14  on\nBougainville  damaged;  43  discontinued  due  to  sustained  vandalism  (i.e.,  all  equipment\nrepeatedly  removed,  stolen,  or damaged); 9 destroyed  either  through  prolonged  deterioration,\nvolcanic activity, or by being run down by ships; and 4 out of service due to faulty  equipment.\nMost  of  the  damaged  navigation  aids  are  on  PNG\u2019s  most  critical  coastal  routes.  The  existing\n                                                       \n1  TA 3162-PNG: Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids, for $500,000, approved on 1 February 1999.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised S. Jarvenpaa, Sr. Project Specialist/Mission Leader; C. Bantugon, Associate\n\nProject Analyst; and S. Meyrick, Corporate Specialist (staff consultant).\n\n3 Source: Population census 1990. The next census will be carried out in 2000.\n\n\f2\n\nsystem of daymarks is not adequate to facilitate safe maritime travel of the island communities.\nMany  of  these  are  also  in  severe  need  of  rehabilitation.  Shippers  have  to  make  expensive\nadjustments  to  voyage  routes  and  schedules  to  overcome  the  shortcomings  in  the  navigation\naids  system.  The  current  condition of the navigation aids  system  constrains  development  and\naccess to social services.\n\n6.\nAbout  90  percent of the  world\u2019s  cargo  is transported  by  sea  relying on  nautical  charts.\nConsequently, most coastal countries place great importance on their coastal management and\ncharting activities. The PNG archipelago comprises about 1.7 million square kilometers (km2) of\nsea area, of which most is inadequately surveyed. Currently, hydrographic survey and charting\nactivity is performed by the Royal Australian Navy under a memorandum of understanding with\nPNG, at a survey rate of about 300 hundred km2 per annum. Currently 55 charts cover PNG\u2019s\ncoastal  waters.  Most  of  these  are  based  on  old  hydrographic  and  geodetic  surveys,  which\ndeviate  from  modern  international  standards.  A  great  number  of  shoals  and  other  hazards  to\nnavigation were undetected at the time of the survey as measurement points were sparse and\nscattered.  Location  of  many  off-lying  islets  may  not  be  accurately  positioned  on  these  charts\ndue to the limitations of the conventional survey methods used.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty\n\nEighty-five percent of the PNG population lives in the rural areas fragmented by rugged\n7.\nterrain  and  inadequate  physical  infrastructure.  The  coastal  communities  rely  on  subsistence\nfarming and fishing for  their  livelihoods,  supplemented  by  a  small  amount  of  cash  activities\u2014\ntrading in fish, local produce, and in some areas, copra, palm oil, and betel nut. The agriculture\nsector  has  been  stagnant  for  a  long  period,  averaging  growth  of  only  1  percent  per  annum.\nRural  incomes  are  approximately  only  one  tenth  of  those  in  urban  areas.  In  many  coastal\ncommunities,  expansion  of  cash  activities  will  depend  on  improvements  in  marine  transport,\nsince remoteness and  rugged  terrain  prohibit  construction of a  road network to effectively  link\nthem to inland areas.\n\n8.\nWhile PNG is classified as a low-middle-income country with a 1998 per capita income\nof $890, its social indicators are typical of countries of a much lower income level. According to\nthe World Bank\u2019s 1999 country assistance strategy for PNG, 37 percent of the population now\nlive  at  or  below  the  poverty  line,  defined  as  the  minimum  income  required  to  support  a  life-\nsustaining nutritional intake. On the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) human\ndevelopment index, PNG ranks last among Pacific Island countries and 164th of 174 developing\ncountries.4 These indicators make PNG\u2019s human development level the lowest of ADB's Pacific\ndeveloping member countries. The UNDP's 1998 human poverty index value of 72 reflects the\ncountry's poor access to basic services: low life expectancy of 55 years, with about 25 percent\nof women not surviving beyond the age of 40, high infant mortality rate (62 per 1,000 live births),\nprimary  and  secondary  school  enrolment  of  only  55  and  9  percent  respectively,  and  average\nliteracy of 52 percent (40 percent for women).\n\n9.\nThe disadvantaged in PNG society are disproportionately female. Girls account for only\n33 percent of total school enrolments and women make up only 30 percent of tertiary students.\nRural women have poor access to health care, and life expectancy for rural women is low as a\nresult of prevailing high  rates of  maternal  mortality,  poor  nutrition,  and  generally  high  rates  of\nviolence  against  women.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  1999  country  assistance  strategy  estimates  that\nviolence against women is endemic in PNG with 70 percent of all PNG wives battered by their\n\n                                                       \n4\n\nUNDP. 1988. Papua New Guinea Human Development Report (draft).\n\n\f3\n\nhusbands.  As  a  result,  women  have  lower  living  standards  than  men  and  suffer  more  during\ntimes of economic downturn. In most areas, however, women are the prime food producers.\n\n10. With  a  high  natural  growth  rate,  great  geographic  dispersion,  and  42  percent  of  the\npopulation  under  the  age  of  15,  the  demand  for  social  services  is  a  serious  challenge  to  the\nGovernment. In coastal communities, disaffection with the Government\u2019s ability to provide these\nservices is pervasive, and contempt for its assets and programs is common. There is increasing\nfrustration with the slow pace of development and  the  unequal  distribution of  income between\nurban and  rural communities.  Social frustration  is  manifested  in  the  rate  of  vandalism  against\npublic  property,  and  in  particular  the  installations  of  navigation  aids.  The  Government  has\nattempted to address these concerns through the 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Governments\nand  Local-Level  Governments \nimproves\ntransparency, and empowers provincial administrations and community leaders in the provision\nof services in direct consultation with the constituents.\n\nthat  decentralizes  government  administration, \n\n3.\n\nTransport\n\n11.\nThe  transport  system  is  multimodal,  dispersed,  and  in  comparison  with  other  low-  to\nmedium-income  developing  countries,  undeveloped.  There  are  26,962  km  of  roads;  17\ncommercial ports; numerous government and private wharves, jetties, and landings; 46 airports;\nand  hundreds  of  airstrips.  Geographic  dispersion  of  the  population  and  the  rugged  terrain  in\nboth inland and coastal areas imply that a significant portion of high-cost transport infrastructure\nserves relatively few people.\n\n4.\n\nThe Maritime Transport Sector\n\nThe  maritime \n\ntransport  sector \n\n12.\nis  dualistic,  with  (i)  a  relatively  well-developed\ninfrastructure serving the main urban areas (Kimbe, Lae, Madang,  Port  Moresby, and  Rabaul)\ncatering  to  both  international  and  coastal  traffic,  and  (ii)  a  large  number  of  lesser  ports  (e.g.,\nAlotau,  Kavieng,  Oro  Bay,  Wewak,  and  others)  serving  smaller  vessels  engaged  mainly  in\ncoastal traffic.\n\na.\n\nDemand Patterns\n\n13.\nImports from overseas are delivered to the main ports of Lae and Port Moresby, and are\nthen distributed throughout the country by road, air, and to the remote coastal communities, by\nsmall  coastal  vessels.  This  means  that  some  minor  ports  are  congested,  but  remain  of  minor\nimportance  in  terms  of  tonnage.  Over  the past 10  years,  vessel  calls  at  all  PNG\u2019s  ports  have\ngrown  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  3.3  percent,  rising  to  7,486  in  1998.  Calls  by  overseas\nvessels, which doubled to 2,347 in the  same period,  were  responsible for  most  of  the growth,\nwhile coastal vessel traffic growth was relatively stagnant.\n\n14.\nThe  mix  of  vessel  types  in  PNG  waters  has  significantly  changed  during  the  past  10\nyears. In particular, in  the  overseas  trade,  the  number  of  calls by  container  ships and  tankers\nhas more than doubled (from 307 per annum in 1988 to 678 in 1998), while calls by the general\nbreak-bulk  cargo  ships  have  remained  steady,  and  declined  in  proportion  to  other  ship-calls.\nCalls by overseas passenger cruise ships are increasing, approximately doubling over the past\n10  years,  albeit  from  a  small  base.  The  increase  in  overseas  vessel  traffic  was  recorded  by\nships  carrying forestry products,  rising from  zero  in  1988  to  an  average  of  over  900  calls  per\nannum between 1994 and 1998. Forestry, however, has been highly volatile and the increase of\nrelated vessel traffic in PNG waters in recent years cannot be considered permanent.\n\n\f4\n\n15.\nThe  most  frequently  visited  ports  are  Madang  and  Kimbe,  followed  by  Port  Moresby,\nLae, and  Rabaul. Vessel  traffic, however,  does  not  correlate  with  cargo  throughput,  for  which\nPort Moresby and Lae are by far  the  largest ports  in PNG.  Madang and  Kimbe are,  however,\nimportant regional ports that cater to small vessels serving passenger traffic, and particularly in\nKimbe, agricultural exports. Port Moresby and Lae, on the other hand, represent PNG\u2019s primary\ninternational  ports  and  handle  the  bulk  of  overseas  container  and  international  tanker  traffic.\nVessel traffic and cargo volumes are in Appendix 2.\n\n16.\nConsequently, the priority navigation aids do not only relate to the economic importance\nof  the  two  primary  international  ports,  but  also  account  for  the  relatively  heavy  small-vessel\ntraffic in the areas of the regional ports. Passenger traffic, in particular, is a significant concern,\nwith the coastal operators moving well over 1,000 people a day between Lae, Madang, Kimbe,\nKavieng,  Buka,  and  numerous  other  minor  ports  in  the  region.  In  addition,  numerous\nnoncommercial village boats ferry large numbers of passengers by sea, sometimes over great\ndistances  in  small,  open,  overloaded  craft.  Many  minor  ports  that  serve  this  traffic,  presently\nhave no navigation aids; this represents a significant risk to passenger safety.\n\nb.\n\nHydrographic Survey and Charting\n\nOf the 1.7 million km2 of sea area, 10 percent has been adequately surveyed, 5 percent\n17.\nof which needs to be surveyed again. Eighty-five percent of the area has not been surveyed and\ncannot, subsequently, be used for maritime travel. The chart ratings given to the existing charts\nproduced by the Royal Australian Navy range between AQ-IA under International Hydrographic\nOffice  (IHO)  standards. While  the  AQ  indicates  that  among  PNG  charts  (i)  some  permit  safe\nmarine  navigation  of  vessels  routinely  operating  in  any  one  world  maritime  area,  and  that  (ii)\ncertain  charts  meet  IHO  Standard,  the  IA  rating  signifies  that  many  of  these  charts  are\ninadequate, and that charts exist that do not meet the minimum standards and are unacceptable\nfor safe navigation.\n\n18.\nIt is only through nautical charts that the navigators can know the depths, location of aids\nto navigation, navigable routes, and forces of tidal currents. These allow planning of the safest\nand  most  economic  route  from  one  port  to  another.  More  importantly,  navigators  can  locate\nalternative  routes  in  case  of  bad  weather  or  to  avoid  grounding.  The  inadequate  charting  of\nPNG  waters  has  an  adverse  effect  on  the  economy.  Hazardous  navigation  and  the  poor\ncondition of navigation aids have translated  into  higher  insurance premiums due  to  the  higher\nrisks.\n\n19.\nModern technology used in navigation, such as the global positioning system (GPS) and\nelectronic  chart  display  and  information  system,  requires  a  much  higher  degree  of  accuracy\nthan  is  provided  in  the  existing  PNG  hydrographic  charts.  Hydrographic  data  is  essential  for\nPNG\u2019s maritime and navigational safety; inadequate hydrographic services can lead to delays in\nresource  exploration.  In  the  marine  environment,  there  can  be  no  exploitation  of  resources\nwithout exploration; this requires hydrographic data.\n\nHydrographic-related  memberships  of  PNG \n\n20.\nIHO,\nInternational  Maritime  Organization  (IMO),  Fisheries  Department  of  the  Food  and  Agriculture\nOrganization  of  the  United  Nations,  and  International  Association  of  Lighthouse  Authorities.\nUnder IHO criteria, PNG holds  no  capacity for  surveying or  charting; has  no qualified  staff for\nsurveying,  map  making, or  drafting;  and possesses no  capacity  to  issue  its  own  hydrographic\ncharts, instructions to mariners, or marine publications.\n\nthe  United  Nations, \n\ninclude \n\n\f5\n\nc.\n\nNavigation Aids System\n\n21.\nCurrently,  96  navigation  aids  of  the  total  of  166  are  operational.  Seventy  aids  are\nnonoperational,  with  14  in  Bougainville  damaged,  43  aids  discontinued  due  to  sustained\nvandalism (i.e., all equipment repeatedly removed, stolen, or damaged), 9 aids with weather or\nvolcanic  activity-related  deterioration, and 4  out of  service  due  to  faulty  equipment.  Most  aids\nare  in  poor  condition  due  to  vandalism,  environmental  deterioration,  age  of  the  installation,\ninappropriate  design,  or  inadequate  maintenance.  The  level  of  vandalism  and  environmental\ndeterioration  correlate  with  the  geographic  location,  with  some  areas  suffering  losses  from\npersistent  community  vandalism,  while  other  areas  are  subject  to  severe  annual  weather\npatterns  that  accelerate  deterioration  rates.  Most  aids  are  well  below  the  expectations  of\nmariners and the needs of the  maritime  transport  system  in PNG. Also,  most  of  the damaged\naids are on PNG\u2019s critical maritime routes. The system of daymarks is not adequate to facilitate\nsafe  maritime  travel  by  the  island  communities.  Many  of  these  are  in  severe  need  of\nrehabilitation.\n\nd.\n\nMajor Shipping Routes\n\n22.\nPNG  shipping  can  be  categorized  as  (i)  international  through  traffic,  (ii)  coastal  traffic\nbetween the major ports, and (iii) small vessel traffic serving numerous minor ports. About 2,850\nvessels per year pass through eastern and northern PNG waters on voyages to Asian ports in\nthe  Peoples  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  Republic  of  Korea.  This  traffic  is  principally  bulk\ncarriers, container vessels, and general cargo vessels. There is no traffic in crude oil on these\nroutes.  To  pass  through  the  north  Coral  Sea,  traffic  is  evenly  divided  between  two  routes:\nJomard Entrance or around Rossel Island. Navigation aids on these routes are  vital  and  need\nattention.  The  most  frequently  used  routes  are  Jomard\u2013Vitiaz  Strait  for  vessels  heading\nnorthwest  to  Hong  Kong,  China  and  the  Philippines;  Jomard\u2013Vitiaz  Strait  west  of  Manus\nProvince for  vessels going to the  Republic  of  Korea  and  southwest  Japan;  and  Jomard\u2013Saint\nGeorges Channel and Rossell northeast of New Ireland Province for vessels on route to Japan.\nThese routes are reasonably well served with navigation aids and charts. The vessels on these\nroutes  usually  carry  radar  and  GPS,  and  are  subject  to  inspection  by  safety  authorities.  The\nnavigation aids on these routes require less attention. Petroleum products are shipped from the\nKumul oil terminal in the Gulf of Papua. This traffic quickly departs PNG waters and heads for\nTorres Strait.\n\nThe  coastal  routes  between  the  major  ports  are  used  by  about  seven  overseas  and\n23.\nthree  major  local  shipping  companies.  Large  and  fast  container  ships  and  some  petroleum\ntankers also use these routes. The most frequently traveled route is that between Port Moresby\nand Lae with a  recorded  230  ship  movements  in  1998. Significant effort  is  required  to  restore\nthe navigation aids on these routes and new aids are required to rectify deficiencies and gaps.\n\n24.\nSouthwest PNG. The navigation aids on the Ely River are maintained by private mining\nand  oil  companies.  Dary  and Bristow  aids  are  adequate for  traffic  entering  the  Ely  River.  The\nKumul oil terminal and Bramble Cay have good lights. There is adequate sea-room between the\nroute used from Kumul oil terminal to Bramble Cay and Torres Straights, and the seaward limit\nof the river bank. Marking the seaward bank is not practicable due to the shifting nature of the\nbank. Eastward, Gouri is used as a timber port and requires a new navigation aid. Lesser ports\nused by coastal traffic need hydrographic charts prior to installation of aids.\n\n\f6\n\nPort Moresby West. The majority of coastal vessels use a difficult and narrow inshore\n25.\nroute past Haidana Island and Boera Head. Hydrographic charts and the navigation aids on this\nroute  require  considerable  improvement.  The  route  from  Port  Moresby  to  Ava  Point  is\nhazardous with numerous seaward reefs. While large container, bulk, and tanker vessels steer\nfar  seaward  to  avoid  these  dangers,  smaller  vessels  additionally  suffer  from  risk  posed  by\nstrong southeastern trade winds for eight months of the year. Both the hydrographic charts and\nthe navigation aids require significant attention.\n\nSouthern  Approach  to  the  China  Straits.  Most  traffic  uses  this  southeastern  end  of\n26.\nmainland  PNG  through  the  China  Straits  and  is  subject  to  risks  of  deficient  navigation\nconditions.  Hydrographic  survey  on  this  submerged  reef  was  carried  out  in  1945,  and  many\nareas are uncharted. The hydrographic survey needs to precede installation of navigation aids.\nThe China Straits is regularly used by container vessels on route from Port Moresby to Lae, the\ntwo  most  important  ports  in  the  country.  The  tracks  need  to  be  improved  with  new  and\nrefurbished navigation aids.\n\nRaven  Channel.  Raven  Channel  is  one  of  the  two  most  important  shipping  routes  in\n27.\nPNG  waters.  This  extremely  narrow  channel  is  subject  to  strong  tidal  streams  and  risks  are\nincreased  by  uncharted  reefs  and  shoals.  Only  vessels  on  route  to  Europe  can  avoid  Raven\nChannel  by  taking  the  similarly  risky  Bright  Island  Passage.  This  passage  needs  additional\nnavigation  aids  to  improve  safety.  Raven  Channel  is  proposed  to  be  bypassed  by  way  of  a\nnorth-south  route  west  of  Nuakata  Channel,  which  can  be  adequately  marked  to  significantly\nreduce  navigation  risks.  The  navigation  aids  need  upgrading  to  meet  their  objectives  on  the\nGoshen  Strait,  one  of  the  principle  routes  north  between  the  mainland\u2019s  eastern  tip  and\nNormanby  Island.  The  route  to  Lae  from  Goshen  Channel  needs  a  new  hydrographic  survey\nbecause the route now comes within one nautical mile (nm) of navigational hazards. The route\nserves all  coastal  vessel  traffic  between  the  two  main  population  centers.  Star  Reef  Passage\noffers a wider route to Lae with only 20 nm of confined inshore waters instead of 70 nm on the\nGoshen  Channel.  It  offers  no  distance  savings,  but  with  new  navigation  aids  and  increasing\ninstallation of GPS, it will yield safety benefits.\n\n28.\nLae\u2013Madang\u2013Wewak.  The  two  hundred  nm  of  coastline  from  Fortification  Point  to\nMadang has no major lights, but there is ample sea room, depths are acceptable at 1,000-1,500\nmeters, and no isolated submerged dangers are near or on the route. The 190 nm of coastline\nfrom Madang to Wewak have four major lights, which is adequate for the coastal traffic.\n\nSepik River. Sepik  River  hosts  a  large  number  of  communities  and  requires  a  day-\n\n29.\nmarking system, and replacement of the only light.\n\n30.\nLae to New Guinea Islands. Most international vessels trading with PNG travel to Lae,\nKimbe, Kavieng, and Rabaul.  To  reach  New  Britain  they  use a  pass north of  Umboi  Island. A\nhydrographic survey is needed. High priority additional navigation aids are needed to mark the\nNessup Channel used by smaller coastal vessels. Only two major navigation lights exist on the\nroute from Lae to Rabaul, but the route also has ample sea room, deep water, and no off-lying\ndangers,  and  is  navigated  by  vessels  with  radar  and  GPS.  All  aids  need  replacement  on  the\nroute to Kavieng, and lights on the Gazelle Peninsula need upgrading.\n\n31.\nSeveral local companies operate barges and ferries to numerous  minor  ports.  Many of\nthese ports do not have adequate hydrographic charts nor navigation aids. Safe navigation on\nthese routes relies heavily on the local knowledge of the ship operator. A program for installing\nnew  navigation  aids  is  needed,  particularly  on  the  north  coast  where  there  is  significant\n\n\f7\n\npassenger traffic. Most of the minor ports in the Gulf of Papua feature mangroves and shifting\nmud and sand banks making marking of these routes impracticable.\n\n32.\nNavigation  aids  are  required on one new  coastal  route,  the  Nuakata  Channel;  Nessup\nChannel needs significant improvement. The shortest route  between  Port  Moresby and Lae  is\nvia the China Straits and Raven Channel, northeast of Milne Bay. It is 190 nm shorter than the\nroute  via  Jomard  Entrance  and  Kiriwina.  Transit  of  Raven  Channel  involves  high  navigational\nrisk, particularly for large vessels, and all international companies give their operator discretion\nto use longer routes. Even if fully marked with navigation aids this channel would be hazardous\ndue to its narrow width, poor angles of approach, and vigorous tidal streams. The new Nuakata\nChannel would enable bypassing of Raven Channel, and be significantly  wider  and straighter,\nhence greatly reducing the navigational risk. A  new  metric  chart  will  be  available  in  mid-2000.\nMarking the Nuakata Channel has been endorsed by the shipping industry. Nessup Channel is\nthe  southern  entrance  to  Dampier  Strait  at  the  western  end  of  New  Britain  and  is  used  by\nvessels heading for north  New  Britain,  New  Ireland,  and  Rabaul.  It  is  42  nm  shorter  than  the\nroute  north  of  Omboi  Island.  The  latter  route  is  poorly  surveyed.  Nessup  Channel  passes\nthrough extremely confined waters and needs additional navigation aids.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nNational Planning Framework\n\n33.\nThe  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  1997-2002  is  the  principal\npolicy  guideline  for  the  country\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  It  aims  to  create  an\nenvironment that encourages the local population to use their land, labor, and natural resources\nfor the national benefit. For this, the Government places paramount importance on the provision\nof health and education services, the maintenance of infrastructure, the creation of opportunities\nfor income generation, and the tackling of peace and security problems. The following  sectors\nare receiving budget appropriations consistent with the priority areas: (i) rural development and\nagriculture,  (ii)  health,  (iii)  education,  (iv)  infrastructure  maintenance  and  development,  (v)\npeace and security, and (vi) capacity building within institutions at all tiers of government.\n\nThe Government\u2019s draft National Transport Infrastructure Plan of May 2000 and the new\n34.\nTransport  Policy  of  2000  (i)  confirm  the  importance  the  Government  assigns  to  transport\ninfrastructure,  and  (ii)  provide  sector  strategies  to  maintain,  rehabilitate,  and  improve  existing\ntransport  infrastructure;  and  create  new  infrastructure  to  enhance  efficient  production  and\ndistribution  of  goods  and  services,  and  to  improve  efficiency  and  integration  of  the  transport\nservices.  Provision  of  safe  and  integrated  maritime  transport  services  and  improvement  of\nnavigational and hydrographic services are set as objectives for the maritime sector.\n\nIn  maritime  safety,  the  Government  aims  to  provide  navigational  support  services  that\n35.\nmeet international standards and are responsive to the needs of transport providers and users.\nIn addition to maintaining a system of visual and radar navigational markers, the Government\u2019s\ngoal is to provide timely and relevant navigational and maritime safety information to shippers.\nThe system would cater not only for the economically most important international and coastal\nroutes,  but  also  support  social  services  to  remote  communities.  The  Government\u2019s  policy\nsupports  sector  reorganization  and  proposes  establishment  of  a  maritime  safety  authority\n(MSA).\n\n\f8\n\n2.\n\nMaritime Sector Organization\n\na.\n\nMaritime Functions of the Department of Transport and Civil Aviation\n\ntrading  regulation,  and \n\n36.\nMaritime  sector  management  is  established  under  the  Merchant  Shipping  Act  of  1980\nand  its  regulations,  and  the  PNG  Harbours  Board  Act  of  1976.  Under  the  former,  the\nGovernment is responsible, through its Department of Transport and Civil Aviation (DOTCA), for\nmaritime  safety  and  navigation  aids.  This  includes  responsibility  for  registration  of  vessels,\nmaritime  safety,  crew  certification  and  conditions,  maritime  incidents  and  investigations,\nnavigation  aids,  pilotage,  coastal \ninternational\nconventions.5  DOTCA,  headed  by  a  secretary,  includes  the  Office  of  Transport,  Office  of\nAviation, and Office of Policy Development, each headed by a director. The maritime objectives\nof the Office of Transport coincide with those of  the  International  Convention for the  Safety of\nLife at Sea, 1974. They are to ensure that sea transport services are economically efficient, well\nintegrated, technically safe, and adequate to meet the demand. The Office of Transport and its\nMaritime Transport Division (MTD) include (i) ship surveys, inspection, and port state control; (ii)\nnavigation  aids;  (iii)  marine  search  and  rescue;  (iv)  monitoring  and  control  of  oil  pollution;  (v)\nsmall  boat  safety  awareness  and  education;  and  (vi)  hydrographic  surveys.  MTD  comprises\nthree  branches:  (i)  Maritime  Safety  Branch  (MSB),  (ii)  Maritime  Industry,  and  (iii)  Shipping\nServices  Branch.  It  has  six  regional  offices:  in  Alotau,  Daru,  Lae,  Madang,  Port  Moresby,\nRabaul, and one office in Angoram for inland traffic. Recently, however, due to the shortage of\nrecurrent  funds,  some  of  these  offices  have  not  been  operating.  The  existing  organization\nconsists of a total of 68 staff. An organization chart is in Appendix 3.\n\nliabilities  under \n\nb.\n\nMaritime Safety Branch\n\n37.\nMSB  is  responsible  for  maritime  safety  within  MTD  including  (i)  navigation  aids,  (ii)\nsearch  and  rescue,  (iii)  oil  spill  and  disaster  prevention,  (iv)  ship  registration,  (v)  port  state\ncontrol  and  small  boat  safety,  (vi)  hydrographic  surveys,  and  (vii)  liabilities  under  international\nconventions. MSB includes a depot in Madang with a staff of 36, 9 of whom are technical and\nthe rest attached to MSB\u2019s vessels, Sepura and Kulasi. The Madang depot houses an inventory\nof  lanterns  and  mechanical  equipment.  The  search  and  rescue  operations  have  five  6-meter\ncatamarans, and the hydrographic office a 26-meter hydrographic vessel.\n\ni.\n\nNavigation Aids Operations\n\n38.\nThe objectives of the navigation aids system in PNG, as in other maritime countries, is to\nprovide  a  nationally  integrated  navigational  support  service  that  meets  international  standards\nand  is  responsive  to  the  needs  of  transport  providers  and  users.  In  addition  to  maintaining  a\nsystem of visual and radar navigational markers, the system should provide timely and relevant\nnavigational and maritime safety information to shipowners. The system should cater not only to\nthe  economically  most  important  international  and  coastal  routes,  but  also  support  social\nservices to remote communities.\n\n39.\nThe present system of navigation aids fails to meet any of these objectives. The technical\naudit  of  navigation  aids  carried  out  under  this  study  found  that  of  the  166  aids  in  PNG  waters,\nnearly all require urgent remedial attention to structures, lighting, or electrical equipment. Only 58\npercent are operating at all, while the remaining 42 percent are nonoperational due to vandalism\n\n                                                       \n5 An exception to this is pilotage, which is entrusted to the Papua New Guinea Harbours Board.\n\n\f9\n\nor prolonged deterioration.  Many of the nonoperational  aids have been out of service for  years.\nVandalism  is  the  most  common  and  persistent  cause  of  physical  failure  of  the  networks  of\nnavigation aids, accounting for 57 of 70, or 81 percent, of failed aids.\n\n40. When  a  light  or  beacon  fails,  there  is  usually  a  considerable  delay  before  the  failure  is\nreported,  and  a  further  delay  before  it  is  repaired,  if  it  is  repaired  at  all.  Some  aids  are  never\nrepaired due to persistent and apparently unstoppable vandalism. Mariners are not kept informed\nof which navigation aids are not operational, nor are they informed when failures are restored or\nnew aids are installed. As a result, international and coastal  shipowners have  lost  confidence  in\nthe  system  and  consider  the  Government\u2019s  management  of  the  system  unresponsive  to  their\nneeds. The level of navigational service that they receive is not worth the fees they are required to\npay  in  lights  dues.  Consequently  ship  operators  have  had  to  develop  and  rely  on  the  \"local\nknowledge\"  of  their  crews  in  order  to  deal  with  navigational  hazards.  As  a  result,  maritime\ntransport  in  PNG  is  inefficient  and  below  an  achievable  standard.  Gains  from  higher  standards\nand volume of maritime transport services, and lower maritime transport costs can be obtained by\nimproving the navigation aids system.\n\nii.\n\nSearch and Rescue Operations\n\n41.\nThe  importance  of  saving  lives  and  property  at  sea  is  reflected  in  the  comprehensive\ninternational  convention  regulations  that  govern  public  maritime  services  provision,  e.g.,\nregulations under Safety of Life at Sea and Search and Rescue (SAR) Convention of 1979 under\nInternational  Maritime  Organization.  Shore-based  services  include  constant  radio  monitoring,\noperation  of  high-speed  rescue  craft,  and  fire-fighting  equipment,  but  may  extend  to  rescue\nhelicopters, and medical and similar services. SAR services need to be integrated with shipborne\nSafety of Life at Sea equipment. This equipment reflects technological developments in materials\nand equipment.  The  International  Maritime  Organization  introduced  the  global  maritime  distress\nand safety system (GMDSS) in 1997. Land-based SAR arrangements must include highly efficient\ncoordination facilities, full-time monitoring services of radio distress frequencies, and of course the\nmeans to offer help at short notice and at high speed, which means life craft and helicopters on\nconstant standby. If there are offshore platforms in the zone, the SAR organization must also be\nequipped to deal with emergency calls from them.\n\n42.\nThe  SAR  function  within  MSB  receives  a  notification  of  missing  persons  at  sea,  and\ninvestigates and activates a search pattern if deemed necessary. The SAR coordinator has SAR\nresources  available  for  rescue  missions.  These  involve  funding  for  commercial  aircraft  services\nprovided  on  regular  flights  in  the  region,  or  hiring  of  a  fixed-wing  aircraft  or  helicopters  to\nimplement a search pattern. Delays are frequently experienced in reporting the  missing persons\nresulting in an expansion of the  search area.  A draft cooperative agreement between PNG and\nAustralia is under consideration for undertaking joint-SAR missions. This document  corresponds\nto the requirements of (i) the Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944, (ii) the International\nConvention on Maritime Search and Rescue 1979, (iii) the International Convention on Safety of\nLife at Sea 1974, and (iv) the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982.\n\nThe potential for loss of life at sea could be greatly  reduced  if  all  motorized  small  craft\n43.\nwere  registered,  compulsory  safety  equipment  and  sea-worthiness  requirements  (e.g.\nbuoyancy) were required on  small  craft,  and  reporting  requirements and  safety  procedures  as\nwell  as  preferred  routes  were  made  mandatory.  Implementation  of  these  are  proposed  to  be\ninvestigated under a TA for Remote Maritime  Route  Improvement  included  under  ADB\u2019s  2000\ncountry program for PNG.  Albeit  limited  in  its  current  coverage  to  only  commercial  craft, a bill\nhas also been drafted to cover small craft.\n\n\f10\n\n44.\nImplementation  of  IMO\u2019s  GMDSS  targets  modernization  of  ship  rescue  operations\nworldwide.  It  has  recommended  that  all  ships  in  international  waters  be  required  to  carry\ncommunications  equipment  for  GMDSS,  and  that  each  member  country  construct  land-based\nfacilities  to  support  the  system.  The  global  network  was  intended  to  be  fully  operational  by\nFebruary 1999.  To  meet  this  obligation,  in  1996,  Japan\u2019s  Telecommunications  Engineering  and\nConsulting  Service  recommended  that  GMDSS  coastal  radio  stations  be  installed  in  Port\nMoresby, Lae, Rabaul, and Wewak, at a total cost of about $8 million under Japanese grant-aid\nfunded  by  Japan.  A  later  International  Telecommunications  Union  study  estimated  this  system\nwould cost $4.5  million.  The Government  is currently  exploring  the  possibility  of  funding  such  a\nsystem through its telecommunications services.\n\niii.\n\nOil Spill Prevention and Disaster Response\n\n45.\nMSB  has  the  official  responsibility  of  coordinating  oil  spill,  and  safety  and  rescue\noperations in PNG. Oil-spill equipment was procured and delivered under the ADB project loan for\nTransport Infrastructure Development in 1998.6 These include oil spill booms, mechanical floating\nskimmers,  and  other  equipment  used  in  confining  and  removing  oil  from  waters.  Training  was\nprovided under the project, and most recently in April 2000. This, however, was intermittent and\nlimited,  and  the  preparedness  of  the  unit  is  minimal,  if  existent.  A  memorandum  of  agreement\nbetween PNG and Australia dated September 1997 provides for mutual assistance in case of an\noil-spill incident. The document is in accordance with the International Convention on Oil Pollution\nPreparedness, Response, and Cooperation, 1990.\n\nc.\n\nShipping Registration and Industry\n\n46.\nMSB of  DOTCA is  responsible for  ship  registration.  About  500  vessels  are  registered  in\nPNG. The registration certificate authenticates the main dimensions and tonnage under which the\nship is registered, and these certifications are used by nations whose waters are traveled by the\nvessel and are the basis on which dues are charged. The registry data includes details of vessel\nownership, mortgages, and transfer of interests.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nIn  1986,  the  ADB-funded  TA,  Navigational  Aids  Improvement  Study,7  recommended\n47.\nexpanding the navigation aids network by 58 new aids. Funding for these and oil spill equipment\nwith  associated  training  was  included  under  the  Transport  Infrastructure  Development  Project\n(footnote 6), with oil spill prevention training carried out in July 2000.\n\n48.\nThe  PNG  Maritime  School  has  received  assistance  from  the  Australian  Agency  for\nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  for  Maritime  School  Upgrading  Program  until  1998.\nCurricula was prepared, equipment procured, and training provided to upgrade the certification\nlevel to master mariner 2.\n\nCurrently,  the  sector  is  not  benefiting  from  ongoing  external  assistance  programs.  An\n49.\nexception to this is a series of workshops conducted by the South Pacific  Council, addressing\nregional  issues  including  standards  and  training  certification  of  seafarers,  oil  spills,  safety\nsurveying regulations, search and rescue, and maritime legislation.\n\n                                                       \n6 Loan 1153/1154-PNG: Transport Infrastructure Development Project, for $69 million, approved on 14 January 1992.\n7 TA 642-PNG: Navigational Aids Improvement Study, for $240,000, approved on 10 December 1984.\n\n\f11\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n50.\nThe  navigation  aids  component  of  the  Transport  Infrastructure  Development  project\nincluded  the  construction of 58  navigation aids, costing  about $13.5  million, of  which  the  loan\ncomponent  was  to  finance  $8.6  million.  While  tender  documents  and  prequalification  were\ncompleted  in  December  1994,  no  action  was  taken  on  the  component  by  1995  as  no\ncounterpart funds were available, primarily due to severe fiscal constraints. In 1997, K1 million\nwas  provided  in  the  development  budget  to  support  the  component,  of  which  K200,000  was\nprovided  by  the  Government  and  the  balance  under  the  loan.  This  amount  was  far  less  than\nrequired to carry out the project.\n\nIn  mid-1997,  in  view  of  the  prolonged  funding  constraint,  the  scope  of  the  component\n51.\nwas  reduced  from  58  navigation  aids  to  32,  and  later  that  year  to  10.  Concurrently,  the\nGovernment  requested  an  extension  of  the  loan  closing  to  December  1998,  partly  to\naccommodate  the  navigation  aids  component.  MTD  engaged  a  consultant  to  revalidate  the\nprequalified  tenderers  and  to  issue  a  new  tender,  and  it  hoped  to  mobilize  construction  in\nOctober 1997. However, the consultant\u2019s work was not finalized until  the  third quarter of 1999\n(i.e., long after the component had been canceled). In September 1997, the  entire  component\nwas  canceled  from  the  loans.  Subsequently,  the  Government  requested  that  ADB  consider  a\ndedicated  loan  for  the  navigation  aids.  The  causes  of  the  failure  to  utilize  funds  under  the\nTransport Infrastructure Development Project are the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iii)\n\nThe fiscal  system did not  include a formal  mechanism for  ensuring provision  of\ncounterpart  funding  in  a  timely  manner  and  sufficient  amount,  and  the\nGovernment  attempted  to  place  responsibility  on  MTD  to  provide  counterpart\nfunding from the latter\u2019s recurrent budget.\n\nIn 1997-1999, a severe delay was incurred in issuing the final tender, due to poor\nperformance  of  the  consultant.  This  disabled  implementation  of  even  the\nreduced-scope project in spite of availability of limited counterpart funds.\n\nLacking  project  implementation  and  management  mechanisms  in  the  project\ndesign, limitations of MSB staff, and chronic and unaddressed institutional issues\ncontributed to the poor implementation of the component.\n\nThe Government continuously failed to provide the counterpart funding to support\nthe project due to a fiscal crisis that dominated the macroeconomic environment\nduring the 1990s.\n\nThe new Government of July 1999 has instituted a number of significant policy changes\n52.\nand revamped the  budget  to  improve  confidence  in  PNG's  macroeconomic  management.  The\nfollowing actions of the Government have provided a basis to now move forward in this sector\nwith this Project:\n\n(i)\n\nThe  Government  has  indicated  and  demonstrated  a  high  priority  for  improving\ntransport efficiency and safety in air, land, and sea, and accepted significant aid\nassistance with considerable policy reform content and institutional development\ninitiatives in all three subsectors.\n\n\f12\n\n(ii)\n\nincorporating  a  greater  autonomy \n\nThe  Project  includes  a  detailed  implementation  strategy  to  address  institutional\ncapacity-building  requirements, \nthe\nExecuting Agency, DOTCA, and hence less dependence on fluctuating allocation\nof fiscal revenues through (a) establishment of a trust account under the control\nof DOTCA into which operating funds will be paid prior to commencement of the\nProject; (b) management strengthening and a thorough  reallocation of  recurrent\nfunding  to  support  the  navigation  aids  system;  (c)  strengthening  of  DOTCA  to\ncarry  out  the  respective  duties  including  planning,  acquiring,  and  managing\nresources  for  operation  and  investment;  and  (d)  the  subsequent  creation  of  an\nautonomous statutory authority for maritime safety.\n\nfor \n\n(iii)\n\nA  comprehensive  project  implementation  mechanism  has  been  prepared  to\nassume responsibility for project implementation and strengthening of DOTCA.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nGiven  the  critical  importance  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  transport  has\n53.\nremained a leading priority in ADB's strategy for PNG. Infrastructure and institutional interventions\nin  roads,  and  sea  and  inland  waterways  are  essential  and  prerequisites  for  the  delivery  of\neconomic and social services. They yield suitable economic returns. ADB is helping to restore the\nsystem  of  maritime  navigation  aids  as  part  of  a  broader  and  comprehensive  improvement\nprogram  encompassing  policy  and  institutional  frameworks.  The  Project  incorporates  ADB\u2019s\nconcerns  related  to  community  and  private  sector  participation  and  is  pro-poor  in  nature\ncorresponding to ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n54.\nPolicy  issues  relevant  to  sector  management  were  identified  and  discussed  with\nGovernment officers. These include (i) sector reorganization and establishment of an MSA, (ii)\nestablishment  of  a  sustainable  source  of  cost  recovery-based  funding  for  maritime  safety\nservices  with  a  direct  relationship  with  the  cost  of  services,  (iii)  reduction  in  vandalism  and\nimprovement in community relations and the navigation aids, and (iv) establishment of national\ncapability for hydrographic services.\n\n1.\n\nSector Reorganization\n\nInstitutional  weakness  is  the  most  serious  deficiency  in  the  maritime  safety  system.\n55.\nWhile  the  technical  aspects  of  the  system  have  deteriorated  over  many  years,  these  relate\nprimarily to institutional constraints. These constraints are evidenced in inadequate funding and\nhuman resources; the consequent lack of planning; limited commercial expertise and customer\nfocus;  weak  institutional  structure  and  unproductive  use  of  human  resources;  landowner\nfrustration  and  chronic  vandalism;  and  lack  of  information  management,  technology,  and\ncorporate culture to promote maritime safety. Due to these institutional weaknesses and lack of\nfunding,  MTD  and  DOTCA  are  unable  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  maritime  and  growth\nobjectives.\n\n56.\nImprovement  of  maritime  safety  involves  a  wide  range  of  areas  including  (i)  quality  of\nnavigational  skills,  (ii)  vessel  seaworthiness  and  integrity,  (iii)  updated  vessel  databases,  (iv)\ncapacity to rectify deficiencies immediately, (v) port state control, (vi) enforcement of regulations\naffecting  qualification  standards  of  ship  crews,  (vii)  survey  of  locally  registered  vessels,  (viii)\nreporting  of  navigational  changes  and  dissemination  of  updated  information  to  mariners,  (ix)\n\n\f13\n\nreporting and investigation of ship casualties, (x) protection of coastal marine environment and\ndisaster  remediation,  (xi)  hydrographic  surveys,  (xii)  search  and  rescue  operations,  and  (xiii)\nmodern  communications  and \nrestructuring  and\nstrengthening must be undertaken to address development of these functions.\n\ntechnology. \n\nInstitutional \n\ninformation \n\n57.\nThe  Government  is,  through  the  Project,  embarking  on  a  comprehensive  sector\nimprovement program  to establish effective  maritime  safety  services.  Its objective  is  to,  by  31\nDecember 2000, establish an autonomous MSA that is endowed with a sustained and efficient\ncapacity  to  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  the  rehabilitated  navigation  aids,  and  provide\nmaritime  safety  services  at  international  standards.  This  restructuring  program  is  central  to\nimproving  the  management  of  maritime  sector  services.  The  Government  will  implement  the\nprogram  as  part  of  its  maritime  sector  strategy.  This  requires  that  DOTCA  assume  financial\nresponsibility for operation and maintenance of the navigation aids system. It needs to have the\nauthority  to  set  and collect  charges from  users,  make  independent  management  decisions  on\nthe use of funds, and have management and technical expertise to ensure efficient operations\nand  investment,  to  control  expenditure  productively,  and  to  plan  effectively.  To  launch  the\nprogram, the Government will undertake the initial action program described in Appendix 4. This\ninitial  action  program  includes  (i)  establishment  of  a  trust  account  as  an  interim  financial\ndepository  of  the user  revenues;  (ii)  disengagement  of  the Sepura navigation aids  vessel  and\nthe  related  human  resources  from  DOTCA,  and  contracting  of  transport  services  from  the\nprivate  sector;  (iii)  establishment  of  a  maritime  safety  budget  on  a  cost  recovery  basis\nincorporating  out-sourcing  principles  and  maximizing  private  sector  participation;  (iv)  approval\nand  implementation  of  a  oil  pollution  levy;  and  (v)  submission  of  legislation  to  Parliament  for\nlegal establishment of the MSA.\n\n2.\n\nThe Maritime Safety Authority\n\n58.\nPromulgation of  the  submitted  Maritime  Safety  bill  commences  a  second  phase  under\nthe sector restructuring program. Principles that govern establishment of the MSA include that\n(i)  maritime  safety  remains  a  public  sector  responsibility,  (ii)  all  maritime  safety  functions  be\ncombined into one organization, (iii) this organization be financially  self-sufficient  with  services\nprovided on a user-pay basis, and (iv) as a body corporate, the MSA will have the ability to sue\nand  be  sued  and  have  the  legal  capacity  to  address  landowner  leases  and  service  contracts\nwithin the legal framework established by the Land Act 1996. The Project will finalize the MSA\nact  and  the  related  amendments  in  affected  acts,  and  prepare,  activate,  and  guide\nimplementation of the MSA.\n\n59.\nThe legislation establishing the MSA will enable the MSA to raise its own revenue from\nfees  and  charges,  to  retain  this  revenue  in  accounts  in  its  own  name,  and  to  apply  these\nrevenues  to  the  maritime  safety functions  specified  in  its  legislation.  The financial  objective  of\nthe  MSA  will  be  to  meet  all  of  its  own  expenses,  including  any  future  financing  of  capital\nrequirements,  from  its  own  revenues.  The  MSA  will  undertake  a  range  of  activities  that  are\nrelated to the provision of maritime safety, including provision and maintenance of navigation aids,\nvessel  surveys  and  registration,  port  state  control,  and  management  of  the  national  oil  spill\ncontingency plan, and search and rescue operations. Revenues associated with these functions\nwill,  consequently,  become  part  of  the  MSA's  income.  The  Project  includes  establishment  of\nnational hydrographic services, and the cost of maintaining this function over the longer term will\nbe borne by the MSA. The MSA will also coordinate national search and rescue operations. Both\nof these functions generate additional benefits for a wide range of beneficiaries in addition to the\ncommercial  shipping  industry.  Consistent  with  practice  in  other  countries,  additional  funding\nsources would be established accordingly. However, the financial analysis for the MSA has been\n\n\f14\n\ncarried  out  on  the  assumption  that  all  costs  incurred  by  the  MSA  will  be  met  from  internally\ngenerated revenues. A financial analysis of the MSA is in Appendix 5.\n\n3.\n\nSector Funding and Financial Management\n\na.\n\nBudget Allocations\n\n60.\nAs part of a government department, maritime safety is supported by annual allocations\nfrom  the Government\u2019s  consolidated budget.  Each  year,  DOTCA  submits  a  budget  request  to\nthe  national  budget  authority,  the  Department  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  which,  following\nNational  Executive  Committee  and  Parliamentary  approvals,  returns  an  allocation  in  the\nfollowing  year  that  reflects  maritime  safety\u2019s  political  priority  within  overall  Government\nspending.\n\n61.\nThe Government has recognized that the flow of funds to maintain and manage navigation\naids  over  the  past  several  years  has  been  minimal.  This  is  evident  as  maintenance  of  the\nnavigation aids has only been feasible when funds become available; most of the repair work  is\nleft pending until such time. Subsequently, service delivery performance of the navigation aids is\nnot  being  reported  and  is  not  at  a  desirable  standard.  The  maritime  navigation  aids  system  in\nPNG  has  deteriorated  over  the  past  10  years  to  a  poor  state.  Shippers  have  to  now  make\nexpensive  adjustments  to  voyage  routes  and  schedules  to  overcome  the  shortcomings  in  the\nnavigation aids system.\n\nb.\n\nExpenditures\n\n62.\nThe expenditures and  allocations for  MTD  activities fall  under  activities  101,  102,  103,\nand 104 of the Government\u2019s national budget document corresponding to the Office of Assistant\nDirector,  Maritime  Safety  Regulation  and  Management,  Maritime  Transport  Industry,  and\nHydrographic  Services.  Due  to  the  consolidated  public  accounting,  a  precise  breakdown  of\nexpenditures cannot be provided. About half of MSB\u2019s annual budget is, however, spent on the\ntwo  navigation  aids  vessels, Kulasi  and Sepura amounting  to  approximately  K1.2  million  per\nyear. Moreover, under the accounting  conventions adopted for  the public  sector,  the  recorded\ncost to DOTCA does not include ownership costs\u2014vessel depreciation and the cost of capital.\nThe  inclusion  of  these  costs  would  add  approximately  K1.0  million  per  year  to  the  cost\nestimates. Full crews and provisions are maintained for both  vessels,  despite the fact that the\nSepura has  not  been  operated  since  1996.  The  Kulasi  also  has  had  extended  periods  of\nidleness  in  recent  years,  partly  because  of  maintenance  requirements  and  partly  because  of\ncash  flow  problems.  During  these  idle  times,  DOTCA  has  met  the  full  cost  of  crewing  and\nprovisioning  the  vessels,  but  has  derived  no  value  from  it.  The  large  expenditure  on  these\nvessels has been unproductive.\n\n63.\nThe Sepura  is  not  seaworthy  at  present.  A  detailed  survey  indicated  a  range  of  major\ndefects including (i) excessive wear in the main engines, possibly necessitating replacement; (ii)\nexcessive  corrosion  on deck foundations  and  winch frames;  (iii)  significant deficiencies  to  life-\nsaving  equipment;  (iv)  dysfunctional  autopilot,  probably  requiring  total  replacement;  and  (v)\nsubstandard  or  defective  communications  equipment.  Repair  costs  are  estimated  at\napproximately $742,000.\n\nThe vessel was built to maintain gas-fired navigation aids and buoys, of which the former\n64.\nhave  been  and  the  latter  are  being  phased  out  from  PNG\u2019s  navigation  aids  assets.  These\nrequirements  have  now  largely  disappeared.  Further,  the  Sepura  is  an  expensive  vessel  to\n\n\f15\n\noperate with fuel costs for a day at sea estimated in excess of K4,000 per day; it has a crew of\n17. More fuel-efficient vessels with smaller crew requirements can satisfy transport needs of the\ntechnical  staff  to  maintain  navigation  aids.  Subsequently,  DOTCA  has  agreed  to  sell  Sepura.\nThe respective  redundancy payment for  the  related staff  is a  part of the  sector  reorganization\nprogram and will be treated as counterpart funding under the Project. The utility  of  Kulasi,  the\ntwo  6-meter  search  and  rescue  vessels,  and  the  hydrographic  surveying  vessel  under  MTD\u2019s\nassets will be investigated and contrasted with the  availability  of  private  sector  services under\nthe  TA  for  sector  reorganization.  Appropriate  substitute  vessels  have  been  hired  from  the\nprivate sector in the past.\n\n65.\nClose attention to the cost of vessel  services  is, therefore,  central to efficient  provision\nand maintenance of navigation aids. Private sector service contracts need to be developed for\nlogistical support to MSB\u2019s operations under which MSB pays only for the direct and productive\nuse  of  the  vessels,  helicopter,  or  land  transport,  and  will  no  longer  have  to  provide  for  their\ngeneral  maintenance  and  full-time  crews.  An  appropriate  structured  maintenance  program  for\nnavigation aids, a total of 150 vessel-days per year would be required. With the  allowance for\nnecessary  down  time,  this  constitutes  about  50  percent  employment  for  a  single  vessel.\nAdditionally,  the  community  involvement  strategy  proposed  under  the  Project  will  reduce  the\nneed  for  technical  teams  to  travel  to  the  sites  of  navigation  aids.  It  is,  thus,  unnecessary  to\nmaintain two vessels full time to achieve this.\n\nc.\n\nLight Dues\n\n66.\nThe current structure of navigation aids dues (light dues) under the Merchant Shipping Act\nof 19808 provides for two forms of payment (i) a voyage payment, which covers the ship only for a\nsingle voyage  in PNG waters; or  (ii) an annual payment,  which  covers the ship for an unlimited\nnumber of voyages within a 12-month period from the time of payment. All domestic shipowners\npay on an annual basis. Following recent increases, the per voyage charge is K25 per meter, and\nthe annual fee K60 per meter. The navigation aids fees are given in Appendix 6.\n\n67.\nUntil 1 April 2000, the navigation aids dues for overseas vessels calling at PNG ports were\ncollected by  the PNG  Harbours Board  (PNGHB),  which  retained  1  percent  of  the  revenue  as  a\nservice  charge.  PNGHB  withheld  a  fee  of  K16,652  in  1997.  Long  delays  have  frequently  been\nexperienced  in the payment  of fees  collected by PNGHB: payments for  the  last  two  quarters  of\n1998 were received in April and May of 2000 respectively, and no payments have yet been made\nfor any dues collected in 1999 or 2000.\n\n68.\nMSB  collects navigation aids dues from  coastal and international vessels.  The  revenues\nare  returned  to  the  consolidated  fiscal  revenues.  There  has  been  no  connection  between  the\ncollected fees and MSB\u2019s annual budget allocation. The procedures for collections have not been\nrigorous and arrears are substantial and growing.9\n\n 69.\nThe Government recognizes that the collection procedures are fragmented and ineffective,\nthat the level of arrears is unacceptable, and that there is  likely a  substantial  volume of unbilled\nshipping. Consequently, DOTCA discontinued PNGHB\u2019s collection service effective 1 April 2000.\nDOTCA also increased light dues by an average of 75 percent effective 1  January 2000  to K60\n\n                                                       \n8 The  annual  contribution  rate  under  the  Merchant  Shipping  (Navigational  Aids)  (Amendment)  regulation  1998  of\n\n9 DOTCA\u2019s authority to detain vessels for nonpayment of dues or other reasons under the Merchant Shipping Act is\n\nPNG.\n\nweak.\n\n\f16\n\nper meter for the annual fee and K25 per meter per visit. Regional officers of DOTCA have been\nformally appointed to collect the dues from shipowners.\n\n70.\nProcedures  for  the  collection  of  navigation  aids  dues  from  overseas  vessels  require\nimprovement. A total of K600,575 was collected between 1 April and 8 June 2000 in navigation\naids dues. Under the cash-based accounting of DOTCA, this comprised payments from PNGHB\nfor revenues collected during the second half of 1998, receipts from vessels visiting the Kumul oil\nterminal, and actual collections from overseas vessels during the period. The latter corresponded\nto  K122,000,  or  to  a  quarterly  collection  of  K160,000.  This  compares  poorly  with  the  average\nPNGHB  collections  of  K319,818  over  a  similar  period.  The  comparison  is  even  less  favorable\nwhen the recent increase in dues is taken into account.\n\nThe  collection process  relies on self-reporting by the ship\u2019s agent.  Upon  payment  of  the\n71.\nnavigation aids dues, DOTCA issues a certificate for the ships. No effective process is in place for\nchecking that a vessel calling at a PNG port has a valid navigation aids dues certificate nor is the\nprocess  practical  for  imposing  sanctions  on  a  vessel  not  in  possession  of  a  valid  certificate.\nFurther,  in  the  absence  of  an  arrangement  between  the  Department  of  Customs  and  DOTCA,\nphysical inspection for a valid navigation aids dues certificate is cumbersome for DOTCA officers.\nWhile  DOTCA  actively  seeks  information  from  PNGHB  and  the  ships\u2019  agents  on  the  vessels\ncalling  at  PNG  ports.  The  information  is  often  incomplete  and  provided  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.\nDOTCA\u2019s  navigation  aids  dues\u2019  records  are  kept  manually  in  a  logbook.  Finally,  for  domestic\nvessels the problem lies in enforcement of the payments as some shipowners regard the charge\nunreasonable as the navigational services have been poor.\n\nUnder the sector reorganization component of the Project, DOTCA will (i) require coastal\n72.\nshippers  to  pay  an  annual  fee  in  conjunction  with  the  renewal  of  their  vessel  license,  and  (ii)\nrequire the international ship operators to pay the fee prior to clearing customs at their first landing\nin PNG in a 12-month period.  DOTCA will  request  that customs  check for a  DOTCA  receipt for\nsuch  payment prior to  clearing vessels for  sailing.  The effectiveness of the  collection  procedure\nwill be strengthened under TA for sector reorganization.\n\nd.\n\nOil Spill Levy\n\n73.\nPNG is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from ships.\nTo  discharge  its  obligations  under  this  convention,  in  1996  the  Government  adopted  the\nNational  Oil  Spill  Contingency  Plan.  MSB  is  the  coordinating  agency  for  the  plan.  Under  the\nplan,  an  inventory  of  oil  spill  equipment  was  procured  and  a  recurrent  training  plan  is  being\ndeveloped under the Transport Infrastructure Development Project (footnote 6).\n\n74.\nHowever, there is no clear strategy for funding the facilities and activities to maintain an\nadequate  response  capability.  To  ensure  cost-center-based  financial  sustainability  of  the\nplanned MSA, DOTCA has prepared a draft policy paper on the introduction of a protection of\nthe sea shipping levy for approval of the National Executive Council (NEC). It recommends that\nthe  national  plan  be  funded  on  a  polluter-pays  basis,  using  a  levy  on  ships  most  likely  to  be\ninvolved in an oil spill incident.\n\n75.\nThe strategy proposes a  charge per net  registered ton  (nrt)  to be  levied on all  vessels\nwith a registered length exceeding 24 meters and carrying a minimum of 10 tons of oil on board\nat any time during a calendar quarter. While under this strategy the levy will be applied to most\nforeign  commercial  shipping  visiting  PNG,  its  impact  on  domestic  craft  is  less  clear.  Most\nregistered craft  are  less  than  24  meters  in  length,  and  no  data  is  available  on  the  number  of\n\n\f17\n\nvessels that can carry more than 10 tons of fuel. The proposed levy is K0.30 ($0.1) per nrt per\nquarter. The basis of the levy closely corresponds with the  exposure  of  the  vessel  to  possible\nincident in PNG waters. While the effective discount on navigation aids offered to regular callers\nis currently high, the benefit derived from the provision of the navigation safety function relates\ndirectly  to  the  number  of  calls  in  PNG,  and  thus,  the  more  approaches  negotiated  in  PNG\nwaters, the greater the level of exposure to oil spill risk.\n\n76.\nThe  revenues are estimated  to  yield  about K1.9  million  annually against  the  estimated\ncosts  of  maintaining  oil  spill  preparedness  under  the  plan  at  about  K1.8  million.  Thus,  the\nrevenues from the levy would recover the full cost of the plan. The levy should generate a small\nsurplus by the time the Project is completed. This surplus would be sufficient to cover about half\nof the recurrent costs of hydrographic operations. Analysis of the revenues is in Appendix 7.\n\ne.\n\nEstablishing a Trust Account\n\n77.\nInadequate funding  is  the  chief  reason  for  the  poor  performance  of  MSB  in  promoting\nmaritime safety. Additionally, experience with the Transport Infrastructure Development Project\n(footnote 6) regarding counterpart funding reflects a low priority assigned to the sector under the\nnational Government\u2019s development planning. The Government gives priority to such funding to\ngain confidence in the navigation aids system and implementation of the Project. Consequently,\nestablishment  of  a  trust  account  under  the  Public  Finances  Management  Act  of  1995  is\nnecessary as an interim measure to establish a link between the light dues\u2014a user charge for\nthe  navigation  aids  and  the  performance  of  the  navigation  aids  system.  Establishment  of  the\ntrust  account  needs  to  precede  the  promulgation  of  legislation  for  the  statutory  authority  for\nmaritime safety to ensure financial viability of the new authority.\n\n78.\nA  trust  account  will  allow  MSB  to  expend  the  collected  revenues  directly  in  support  of\nnavigation  and  maritime  safety  services.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  establish  a  trust\naccount  as  a  priority  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Project.  The  trust  fund  is  required  to\nensure (i) execution of the Government\u2019s policy to prioritize development of maritime transport,\n(ii) adequate financing of operation  and  maintenance of the  newly  established navigation  aids\nsystem,  and  (iii)  increased  confidence  of  the  shipping  industry,  which  is  paying  increased\nnavigation aids fees for the improved services.\n\n79.\nDOTCA will appoint a financial manager and a budget administrative officer for MSB to\nmanage and administer the trust account, develop a new collection methodology, and establish\ntransparent  revenue  and  expenditure  reporting.  This  is  also  a  step  in  establishing  an\nindependent financial  management  capable  of  migrating  to  the  planned  statutory  authority  for\nmaritime  safety.  The  incumbents  will  be  qualified  in  accounting,  financial  management,  and\ncomputerized database and information management systems.\n\n80.\nDOTCA  will,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  ensure  stakeholder\nconsultation, provide quarterly reports on the collection and expenditures for the Navigation Aids\nAdvisory Committee (NAAC) in addition to its internal reporting on the trust  account.  The trust\naccount will be maintained as an interim financial management instrument as a transitional step\nunder the sector reorganization program to establish a statutory authority for maritime safety.\n\n\f18\n\n4.\n\nCommunity Engagement Program\n\n81.\nThe  effects  of  continued  vandalism  is  the  primary  cause  for  repair  requirements  of  the\nnavigation  aids.  Over  one  third  of  the  network  is  inoperable  exclusively  because  of  vandalism.\nVandalism  is  motivated  by  both  landowner  dissatisfaction  and  theft.  The  Project  incorporates\nmainstreaming of a community engagement program that includes  (i) implementation  of  service\nagreements  with  community  core  groups  comprising  representatives  from  church,  women\u2019s\ngroups,  youth  organizations,  affected  landowners,  and  elected  village  officials  and  leaders;  (ii)\ndevelopment  of  small  routine  maintenance  contracts;  (iii)  a  public  information  campaign  on  the\nimportance of navigation aids; and (iv) strengthening of law enforcement. Details of the program\nwill  be  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  provincial  administrations.  Under  the  program,  core\ncommunity groups will be identified. These will have credibility and experience in social program\ndelivery at the grassroots level, and will be able to contribute their  well-developed networks and\ninsights to the program.\n\n5.\n\nHydrographic Capacity\n\n82.\nAs with other coastal nations, PNG depends  heavily on the marine environment and the\nresources of its coastal waters. An estimated 50 percent of the population lives on the coastline\nadjacent  to  these  waters,  with  direct  reliance  on  the  near-shore  marine  environment  for\nsubsistence  fishing  and  food,  transport,  and  waste  disposal,  particularly  in  rural  and  regional\nareas.  At  the  national  level,  PNG\u2019s  economic  resources  are  densely  concentrated  in  coastal\nregions  with  major  economic  dependencies  linked  to  marine  resources  including  tourism,\ncommercial fisheries and aquaculture, international and domestic shipping, port development, and\nhydrocarbon and mineral exploration. Combined with the fragile nature of the coral reef and other\necosystems in these waters, it is vital that these marine resources be managed in a sustainable\nway to support the subsistence needs of regional communities and for sustained economic growth\ninto the future.\n\n83. While the land-mass is  relatively  well mapped  with  many geographic  information  system\n(GIS)  data  sets  available  to  support  policy  and  decision  making  for  land-based  resources  and\nenvironmental management issues, 95 percent of the internal waters of rivers and coastal waters\nremain unsurveyed at modern standards. PNG currently lacks the basic charts, coral reef maps,\nand data sets that are required for effective management of these critical resources. The Project\naims  to  address  this  by  providing  the  basic  infrastructure,  database,  data,  and  training  as  a\nfoundation for development and implementation of a national integrated coastal marine resource\nmanagement program.\n\n84.\nPNG does not have a hydrographic and mapping function. The Royal Australian Navy has\nbeen carrying out hydrographic survey and chart compilation of PNG\u2019s waters. These have been\nrecompiled  from  older  charts  of  different  publishers  into  nautical  charts.  The  current  charts  that\ncover  the  PNG  waters  originate  in  Australia  and  United  Kingdom.  Hydrographic  basic  data  is\ngenerally from before 1944. Under the Project, the PNG Hydrographic Unit of MSB would emerge\nwith  the  capacity  to  undertake  hydrographic  surveys  and  marine  resource  management.  The\noutputs  include  IHO-standard  navigational  charts;  electronic  navigational  charts;  nautical\npublications; and delimitation of PNG\u2019s territorial sea, contiguous zone, and exclusive  economic\nzone to discharge its legal obligations under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea\n(UNCLOS 82).\n\n\f19\n\nAdditional  output  is  an  integrated  coastal  marine  resource  management  program\n85.\nsupported by a fully operational marine resource database with capacity to maintain and use the\ndatabase  and  GIS.  The  program  would  network  DOTCA  with  the  University  of  Papua  New\nGuinea,  University  of  Technology  in  Lea  and Port  Moresby,  and  Maritime  College  in  Madang,\nand  impact  on  key  government  and  nongovernment  stakeholder  agencies  responsible  for\nmanaging  coastal  marine  resources  in  PNG.  It  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  population,  in\nparticular, regional communities through more efficient maritime transport, reduction of pollution\nfrom  vessel  grounding,  improvement  in  tourism  planning  and  operations,  better  fisheries\nmanagement,  and  enhanced  waste  management  planning,  mineral  exploration,  and  overall\nsustainable  management  of  PNG\u2019s  coral  reef  environment.  The  benefits  of  hydrographic\ncapacity  include  (i)  safer  and  more  efficient  marine  transport,  (ii)  enhanced  management  and\ncontrol  of  fisheries  and  aquaculture,  (iii)  improved  marine  environmental  management  and\nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  (iv)  enhanced  opportunities  for  mineral  and  hydrocarbon\nexploration, (v) economic development of remote and regional communities, and (vi) improved\ncapacity for tourism development and management.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nAbout  half  of  the  population  of  PNG  live  in  the  coastal  provinces,  most  of  them  in\n86.\nconditions  of  extreme  isolation,  deprived  of  basic  social  services  and  economic  opportunities.\nThe delivery of traded food items, education, and health services all depend heavily on ocean\ntransport.  Integration of the  coastal  communities  with  the national economy,  on  which  income\nand  employment  opportunities  in  the  coastal  communities  ultimately  depend,  requires  great\nimprovement of the frequency, reliability, and safety of coastal maritime transport by commercial\nvessels  and  smaller  private  craft.  A  major  constraint  to  this  development  is  the  poor  and\ndeteriorating level of navigational services provided by the public sector in all coastal areas.\n\n87.\nProvision of navigation aids and other maritime safety services is a public good. Failure\nto  provide  the  services  has  been  due  to  (i)  a  weak  institutional  environment  and  (ii)  chronic\nlandowner  frustration  resulting  in  widespread  vandalism  against  navigation  aids  installations.\nVandalism  is  primarily  a  social  problem,  and  secondarily  a  financial  and  technical  problem.\nLandowner communities must understand the role of navigation aids in their communities and in\nPNG, and must support the network. They are willing to do this provided a  sustained financial\nand  social  commitment  to  their  needs  is guaranteed  by  the authority  managing  the  system  of\nnavigational services.\n\n88.\nThe  coastal  communities  are  frustrated  with  continuing  impoverishment  and  lack  of\nopportunity,  while  the  urban  segment  of  the  economy  grows  in  pace  with  the  increasing\nextraction  of  minerals,  petroleum,  and  timber  resources.  The  isolation  of  coastal  communities\nfrom the economy represents a serious economic loss and has become a social challenge. This\nhas resulted in a breakdown of peace and security conditions across the country, alienation of\ndisadvantaged communities, and economic disintegration.\n\n89.\nInstitutional  weakness  is  the  most  serious  deficiency  in  the  maritime  safety  system.  To\nimprove  maritime  safety  services,  the  Government  will,  through  the  Project,  embark  on  a\ncomprehensive  sector  improvement  program  to  establish  effective  maritime  safety  services.  Its\nobjective  is  to  establish  an  autonomous  MSA  that  is  endowed  with  a  sustained  and  efficient\ncapacity to manage, operate, and maintain the rehabilitated navigation aids, and provide maritime\nsafety  services  at  international  standards.  This  restructuring  program  is  central  to  improving\n\n\f20\n\nmanagement of maritime sector services; the Government will implement the program as part of\nits maritime sector strategy.\n\n90.\nThe  Project  supports  maritime  transport  in  PNG  to  contribute  its  full  potential  to\neconomic  growth  and  development  of  the  country.  The  Project  is  designed  to  (i)  restructure\nmaritime  sector  management  to  enable  provision  of  sustainable  and  effective  maritime  safety\nservices;  (ii)  lower  the  cost of  maritime  transport,  and  improve  safety  of  cargo  and passenger\nmovements into and between urban areas; (iii) improve the distribution of goods and services,\nand support the development of markets; and (iv) generate income opportunities in remote and\nimpoverished coastal rural areas.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n91.\nThe objective of the Project is to contribute to economic growth by releasing the potential\nof the maritime transport  sector. Specifically,  the Project  supports  (i)  geographic  integration  of\nthe  country,  including  remote  populations;  (ii)  distribution  of  goods  and  services  to  the  rural\npoor; (iii) improved affordability, reliability, and safety in travel along the coastal areas; and (iv)\ndevelopment of local markets, and increasing efficiency of trade with domestic and international\ncenters. The Project will significantly raise the confidence of mariners navigating in PNG coastal\nwaters  and  enable  them  to  provide  improved  transportation  services  at  lower  cost  and  lower\nrisk.\n\n92.\nThe  Project  will  (i)  restructure  sector  management  by  implementing  an  autonomous\nMSA, (ii) reconstruct the network of the navigation aids to an acceptable international maritime\nstandard,  (iii)  establish  a  self-reliant  hydrographic  service,  and  (iv)  institutionalize  sustainable\noperation and maintenance of the navigation aids, and (v) implement community programs that\ncontribute  to  effective  network  maintenance.  The  scope  of  the  Project  includes  the  following\ncomponents: sector reorganization; construction of new channels, restoration and rehabilitation\nof  navigation  aids;  provision  of  equipment  for  navigation  aids;  development  of  community\nengagement program; establishment of hydrographic infrastructure and management capacity;\nprovision of training; and project management.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n1.\n\nSector Restructuring\n\nThe  Government  has  embarked  on  a  comprehensive  sector  restructuring  program  by\n93.\nintroducing a 75 percent increase in the navigation aids tariffs and assigning revenue collection\nas a DOTCA responsibility. Sector reforms will be implemented with the support of the Project.\nThis includes the following reform measures:\n\n(i) \n\nEstablish a maritime safety trust account. The account will be an interim financial\ndepository  of  the  user  revenues  including  the  navigation  aids  dues  and  the  oil\npollution  levy.  The  trust  account  will  be  established  by  the  Minister  of  Finance\nunder the Public Finances Management Act by 15 August 2000. The account will\nensure \nreceive  adequate  operation  and\nmaintenance funding. It will establish confidence in the financial sustainability of\nthe  sector  and  the  planned  MSA.  Establishment  of  the  trust  account  is  a\ncondition of loan effectiveness.\n\nthat  all  physical \n\ninvestments \n\n\f21\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSubmit an oil pollution levy to NEC. Approval is anticipated in the very near future\n(with  submission  to  the  Parliament  a  condition  of  loan  effectiveness)  to  ensure\nthe  financial  sustainability  of  sector  operation,  and  in  particular,  to  establish\nPNG\u2019s capacity to address any possible oil spill situations in accordance with its\ninternational obligations as an oil exporting country.\n\nSell the Sepura navigation aids vessel. The Government will make the separation\npayments for the involved staff in accordance  with  its  policies for public  service\nstaff.  The  logistics  services  will  be  analyzed  to  establish  transport  services  for\nsector operations on a least-cost basis.\n\nSubmit  an  MSA  bill  to  NEC  and  Parliament.  This  will  establish  autonomous\nsector management under the auspices of a  self-financial  authority  with  its own\nlegal  entity  and  remuneration  schemes.  This  process  involves  legal  drafting,\ninterdepartmental  circulation,  NEC  approval,  and  three  readings  in  Parliament.\nEstablishment of the MSA will leave regulatory and policy functions with DOTCA\nand assume a role for execution of a regulatory regime.\n\n(v) \n\nEstablish  a  community  engagement  program.  This  will  ensure  integrity  of  the\nnavigation  aids  network  and  provision  of  up-to-date  maritime  navigational  and\nsafety services (para. 98).\n\n94.\nThe promulgation  of  the  submitted  MSA  bill  will  commence  a  second phase  under  the\nsector restructuring program.  The  component  supports establishment  of  the  MSA by finalizing\nthe  MSA  act  and  the  related  amendments  in  affected  acts.  The  component  will  prepare,\nactivate, and guide implementation of the MSA.\n\n95.\nInternational  consulting  services  are  required  from  an  international  firm  to  support  (i)\nsector  restructuring  to  ensure  effective  project  management,  (ii)  preparation  of  the  legal\nframework  for  establishing  and  implementing  the  MSA,  (iii)  regularization  of  community\nparticipation  in  MSA  operations,  and  (iv)  provision  of  a  staff  recruitment  and  training  program\ncovering managerial, technical, and community engagement for improved operation, promotion,\nand  maintenance  of  MSA's  maritime  safety  functions.  About  30  person-months  of  consulting\nservices  are  required  in  the  fields  of  maritime  sector  corporate  planning,  maritime  economics,\nfinancial  management  and  planning,  institutional  restructuring,  corporate  planning,  financial\nmanagement, administration and control functions, human resources management and training,\noutsourcing and contract management, and implementation of community-based development.\nDOTCA will select consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nThese consulting services will be funded by a grant from AusAID. Outline terms of reference are\ngiven in Appendix 8.\n\n2.\n\nNew Channels, Restoration, and Rehabilitation of Navigation Aids\n\n96.\nRehabilitation  and  establishment  of  new  navigation  aids  will  be  carried  out  over  five\nyears commencing with design work and implementation of a community engagement program.\nThe  work  under  the  Project  lays  the  foundation  for  the  recurrent  maintenance  program.  The\nselected  technical  solution  incorporates  (i)  minimum  maintenance  structures,  (ii)  helicopter-\nbased  inspection  of  navigation  aids  in  sites  difficult  to  reach,  (iii)  improved  design  to  prevent\nvandalism, (iv) restoration of aids with appropriate range and simplicity, and (v) standardization\nof  lighting and  power  supply equipment.  The program  has been prepared following  a  detailed\naudit  of  PNG\u2019s  network  of  navigation  aids  and  includes  repair  of  104  navigation  aids,\n\n\f22\n\nreplacement  of  45  navigation  aids,  and  construction  of  45  new  navigation  aids.  A  five-year\nmaintenance  program  commencing  at  Project  completion  will  link  with  the  rehabilitation  and\nconstruction  program.  The  program  will  be  implemented  through  (i)  external  contracts  for\nconstruction of new navigation aid structures, (ii) rehabilitation projects managed and executed\nby MSB, and (iii) implementation of a sector reorganization  plan.  The  three-pronged approach\nhas  been  designed  to  allow  for  maximum  on-the-job  training  opportunities  during  the  field\nprogram and benefits to the community. A summary of the program is in Appendix 9.\n\n3.\n\nEquipment for Maintenance of Navigation Aids\n\n97.\nThe  Project  requires  procurement  of  navigation  aids  lighting,  power  supply,  and  tower\nstructure  equipment.  These  include  lanterns,  radar  transponders,  batteries,  battery  charges,\nsolar  panels,  and  glass  reinforced  plastic  and  lattice  tower  structures.  This  equipment,\nparticularly  the  solar  panels,  and  lanterns  have  a  long  life  of  15  years  provided  appropriate\nmaintenance  is  carried  out.  A  detailed  procurement  program  will  be  established  under  the\nProject for timely provision of equipment inputs to the five-year restoration program.\n\n4.\n\nCommunity Engagement Program\n\n98.\nThe community engagement program aims  to  secure active  community  participation  in\nmaintaining  and  protecting  navigation  aids  installations.  This  will  include  (i)  light  maintenance\nservices, i.e., washing of solar panels and lanterns, painting of structures, and grass cutting; (ii)\nprevention of vandalism attacks against installations; and (iii) ongoing monitoring and reporting\nto  MSB  on  the  status  of  the  installation  in  their  community.  These  services  will  be  provided\nunder fee-based  service  contracts  with  the  core groups.  The  contracts  will be standardized to\nthe extent possible with the support of the community development specialist in conjunction with\nprovincial,  district,  and  local  governments.  The  program  focuses  on  about  200  coastal\ncommunities  in  the  14  maritime  provinces  and  the  national  capital  district.  The  following\nmechanisms will be implemented under the component:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nCore groups will be formed to ensure an inclusive participatory mechanism at the\nvillage  level.  Groups  will  compose  landowners,  village  leaders,  youth,  women's\norganizations, etc.\n\nRoutine  maintenance  service  agreements  with  the  core  group  will  include\npainting,  vegetation  control,  protection  of  installations  against  vandalism  by\npolicing and active community public information, and monitoring and reporting of\nstatus to MSB. The Project will explore provision of on-the-job training to the core\ngroups  to  undertake  more  advanced  routine  maintenance  activities  such  as\nchanging  of  bulbs  and  fuses,  and  checking  battery  liquid  levels.  Increasing  the\ntransfer of maintenance activities will reduce MSB\u2019s and later the MSA\u2019s cost of\ntravel  and  transport  hire  (helicopter,  maritime,  and  land  transport),  build  broad-\nbased community support for the navigation aids, and generate employment.\n\nLand lease conditions and payments required for new aids and of the backlog will\nbe  reviewed,  service  agreements  with  landowners  and  host  villages  will  be\nprepared to provide for regular payment for land access and services.\n\nTraining and education will strengthen the core groups' capacity to provide public\ninformation  functions  so  that  they  can  disseminate  information  to  the  village\nresidents on the importance and safety functions of the navigation aids.\n\n\f23\n\n(v)\n\nPublic  information  and  awareness  campaign  at  the  community  level  will  be\nprovided  by  the  core  groups,  and  include  community  meetings,  focused  group\ndiscussions,  and  workshops  to  increase  awareness  of  the  importance  of\nnavigation  aids  structures.  Information  materials  will  include  effective  posters,\ncomics, and other materials.\n\n5.\n\nEstablishment of Hydrographic Infrastructure and Management Capacity\n\n99.\nHydrographic charts are primary navigation tools. Accurate  charts  allow  vessels  to use\nthe  differential  global  positioning  system  (DGPS).  Inaccurate  charts  do  not  allow  the  use  of\nDGPS, and consequently prohibit night navigation in some areas, lead to increased risk of reef\ncollisions,  require  larger  quantities  of  expensive  navigation  aids,  and  prohibit  comprehensive\nunderstanding of national marine resources.\n\n100.\nThe  Project  will  establish  basic  infrastructure  and  equipment,  institutional  framework\nwithin the MSA with joint programs with the PNG defense forces, and management capacity to\nsupport  implementation  of  a  hydrographic  unit.  The  unit  will  implement  a  marine  resource\ndatabase  to  support  decision  making  on  marine  resource  management,  an  interagency\ninstitutional framework to support integrated usage of the data by all stakeholders, sustainable\nupgrading of skills in GIS database management, application of IHO standards in the production\nof navigational charts for the rivers and coastal waters, identification of baseline information to\nconfirm  PNG\u2019s  territorial  waters  and  exclusive  economic  zone  under  the  United  Nations\nConvention  of  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS  82),  and  promotion  of  data  availability  for  all\nrelevant users.\n\n6.\n\nTraining\n\nThe  Project  will  deliver  significant  skills  upgrading  to  improve  the  managerial  and\n101.\ntechnical capacity of MSB. Training programs will be developed and executed using transfer of\ntechnology,  on-the-job  training,  and  formal  internal  courses.  Training  is  also  required  for  the\nestablishment  of  a  self-reliant  hydrographic  service  and  includes  basic  training  in  navigation,\ngeodesy,  DGPS,  database  management  and  manipulation,  digital  map  production,  and\noperation of the specific system and equipment installed under the Project.\n\n102.\nFor  the  development  of  hydrographic  data  management  capacity,  technology  transfer\nwill  build  capacity  to  establish  surveying  methodologies  using  DGPS  techniques,  multibeam,\nprocessing bathymetric and digital data, and use and management of chart production software.\nOn-the-job training will be provided by a geodesy, operation of DGPS and navigation systems,\noceanography  and  tidal  environment  monitoring  systems,  and  establishing  routines  for\noperation  and  maintenance  of  these  systems,  database  management  and  quality  assurance\nroutines, accurate placing of the coastline, cartography, and chart production. In addition on-the-\njob training will be provided for the hydrographic services through seminars and courses using\nthe Maritime College in Madang, University of Technology in Lae, and the University of Papua\nNew  Guinea.  The  Project  consultants,  in  conjunction  with  these  institutions,  will  design  and\nexecute relevant training programs.\n\n7.\n\nSupport to Project Management\n\n103. Consulting  services  are  required  from  an  international  firm  to  (i)  support  project\nimplementation,  (ii)  establish  a  sustainable  maintenance  operation  for  the  navigation  aids,  (iii)\n\n\f24\n\nestablish a self-reliant hydrographic service, and (iv) support sector reorganization. This support\nwill concurrently strengthen MTD\u2019s  technical,  managerial, and financial  capacity  as a  maritime\nsafety  service  provider  capable  of  transforming  MTD  into  an  autonomous  authority.  These\nservices include extensive on-the-job training, and domestic and external formal training under the\nProject.  About  120  person-months  are  required  in  the  fields  of  (i)  engineering,  construction,\nrehabilitation,  upgrading, and  maintenance of navigation aids;  (ii)  navigation;  (iii)  financial  and\nproject  management;  (iv)  contract  documentation  and  supervision;  (v)  quality  control,  work\nmeasurement,  and  reporting;  (vi)  project  and  maintenance  management,  implementation  of\nworks, community development, and training; (vii) hydrographics, hydrographic data processing\nand database management, oceanography, cartograhpy, and geodesy; (viii) corporate planning;\n(ix)  maritime  economics;  (x)  financial  and  managerial  planning;  and  (xi)  human  resources\nplanning.  The  Project  will  also  cover  the  costs  of  any  external  auditing  that  may  be  required.\nThese consulting services will be financed from the loan funds. DOTCA will select appropriately\nqualified  counterparts  for  each  consultant  for  project  implementation.  DOTCA  will  select\nconsultants  in accordance  with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  Outline  terms  of\nreference are given in Appendix 10.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n104.\nThe total cost of the Project, including taxes, duties, and interest during  construction  is\nestimated  at  $30.12  million,  of  which  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  including  interest  during\nconstruction,  is  about $22.58  million  (75  percent)  and  the  local  currency  cost  (including  taxes\nand  duties)  is  about  $7.54  million  (25  percent).  The  estimated  costs  of  the  various  project\ncomponents are summarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 11.\n\nItem\nA.

Once such cofinancing is formally available, the corresponding loan amount will be canceled.\n   The cofinancing will be administered by ADB under an existing Channel Cofinancing Agreement.\nb  5 percent.\nc  5 percent on local currency expenditures; 2.4 percent on foreign exchange expenditures.\n\n\fE.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n25\n\n105.\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $20.60 million equivalent, representing about\n68 percent of the total cost of the Project. This loan would finance all the foreign exchange costs\nof the equipment, establishment of hydrographic services, training, and consulting services, and\nmost of the foreign exchange costs of the restoration of the navigation aids (72 percent). ADB\u2019s\nincreased  cost  sharing  of  the  Project  is  justified  as  (i)  the  loan  finances  only  the  foreign\nexchange  costs,  and  (ii)  the  Government  is  implementing  a  constrained  fiscal  policy  under  a\nstructural adjustment program with the International Monetary Fund.\n\n106. PNG will be the Borrower. The proposed loan will be made from ADB's ordinary capital\nresources and  be denominated  in  US  dollars.  It  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  25  years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  with  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  pool-\nbased variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent, and a\nfront-end fee of 1 percent of the total loan amount.\n\nThe  Government  is  securing  cofinancing  from  AusAID  for  $0.8  million  to  finance\n107.\nconsulting services for sector reorganization. Once such cofinancing is formally available, ADB\nwill administer these funds under an existing Channel Financing Agreement between ADB and\nAusAID in accordance with ADB guidelines; the corresponding loan amount will be canceled or\nreallocated  in  accordance  with  relevant  ADB  procedures.  Financing  of  the  project  costs  is\nshown in Table 1.\n\n108.\nThe balance of the  project  costs  will  be  met from  the  Government\u2019s  own  resources.  In\nthe special assurance to be incorporated in the loan agreement, the Government has committed\nto  financing  these  costs  at  a  minimum  of  K5.5  million  per  annum  over  the  five-year  project\nimplementation period from 2001 to 2005 and at K1.0 million in the initial year of 2000.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n109.\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  is  DOTCA  with  its  secretary  responsible  for  the\nproject activities as the project director. The Government will appoint a suitably qualified project\nmanager. The project manager will be qualified to provide training and become an instrumental\nstaff  member  in  the  planned  statutory  authority  for  maritime  safety.  MSB  will  be  the\nImplementing Agency for Phase I of the reorganization plan and will handle daily activities of the\nproject.  Activities  include  procurement,  administration,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  the\nconsulting services, works, and equipment. Contract supervision and quality control will be done\nby MSB assisted by international consultants.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nSteering Committee\n\n110. Since  1999,  NAAC,  established  under  the  Merchant  Shipping  Act,  has  convened  five\nmeetings,  which  were  chaired  by  DOTCA.  Its  membership  comprises  representatives  of  the\nDepartment  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring,  Department  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  PNG\nHarbours  Board,  and  shipping  companies  as  per  the  Merchant  Shipping  Act  1980.  While\nDOTCA chairs NAAC, a secretary will be selected from the private sector membership of NAAC.\n\n111.\nThe  Government  has  established  NAAC  as  the  project  steering  committee,  which  will\ninclude  a  representative  of  the  community  participants  under  the  Project.  The  steering\n\n\f26\n\ncommittee provides for broader representation of stakeholders in project implementation. It will\nmeet  every  quarter  to  discuss  and  resolve  emerging  issues  in  project  implementation,\nprocurement, land acquisition, the community engagement program, prioritization of works and\nlocation  of  new  navigation  aids,  hydrographic  surveys,  and  support  to  the  Project.  It  will  also\nreview the quarterly project reports for submission to ADB and issue its opinion on these reports\nto the Government and ADB. The steering committee will (i) monitor, guide, and facilitate project\nimplementation and progress; (ii) identify and mitigate constraints to project implementation and\nadvise  the project  manager on  action  to  be  taken;  (iii)  facilitate  community  support  programs;\n(iv) participate in the bid evaluation committees as an observing member and participate in the\npublic bid openings under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement; and (v) review the reports on the\nuse of the navigation aids trust account.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement\n\n112. Procurement  will  be  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  and\ninternational shopping, and use  DOTCA\u2019s own  technical services  (force account)  in  accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. All new navigation aids and major restoration works will\nbe procured under ICB. All civil works contracts equal to or greater than $1.0 million equivalent in\nvalue and contracts for procurement of goods (equipment) greater than $500,000 in value will be\nprocured under ICB. ICB contracts will be encouraged to include joint-venture arrangements with\nlocal  contractors.  Contracts  below  these  values  may  be  procured  using  international  shopping.\nPrequalification  of  contractors  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on\nProcurement. Contractors will be eligible to tender for one or more of the contract packages within\ntheir respective bid capacities. ADB approval prior to the award of contracts will be required for\nall  ICB  contracts.  Periodic  maintenance  activities  and  reequipping  of  navigation  aids  will  be\ncarried out by DOTCA. ADB will not be committed to financing contracts awarded without prior\nADB  approval.  Designs  and \nthe  Project\nimplementation consultants.\n\ntender  documentation  will  be  prepared  by \n\n113.\nThe  Government  has  requested  advance  recruitment  action  for  consulting  services  to\nexpedite  sector  restructuring.  These  services  will  be  funded  by  a  grant  from  AusAID\nadministered  by  ADB  through  an  existing  channel  financing  agreement  between  the  two\nfinancing  agencies.  The  recruitment  action  entails  DOTCA  proceeding  with  the  consultant\nselection process immediately after the Appraisal Mission and submitting tender documents to\nADB for its approval. Contract award will be subject to loan effectivity. ADB will not be liable for\nany  expense  accrued  under  the  contract  if  the  ADB  loan  is  not  declared  effective.  Tentative\nprocurement packages are in Appendix 12.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe Project will be implemented over five and half years including the first six months of\n114.\norganizational  and  preconstruction  activities  and \nrestoration  activities.\nEstablishment  and  implementation  of  a  community  engagement  program,  preparation  of\ndesigns, prequalification of contractors, and tendering will be carried out from loan effectiveness\nin  2000  until  mid-2001.  Establishment  of  the  hydrographic  system  will  begin  with  personnel\nrecruitment,  and  procurement  and  installation  of  equipment  in  the  first  quarter  of  2001,  and\ncontinue  with  survey  activity  from  early  2001  to  2005.  Production  of  hydrographic  charts  will\nbegin in the fourth quarter of 2001. Training will be integrated with these activities.\n\nfive  years  of \n\n\f27\n\n115. Sector reorganization began in April 2000 with the establishment of cost recovery, with\nDOTCA  collecting  increased  navigation  aids  dues.  The  navigation  aids  trust  account  will  be\nestablished during the third quarter of 2000. Reorganization will commence with mobilization of\nthe consultants in the third quarter of 2000 under advanced procurement action, rationalization\nof MSB resources, and establishment of a legal framework for the MSA. Upon promulgation of\nthe  MSA  bill,  the  MSA  will  be  implemented  commencing  with  the  establishment  of  corporate\nplans, staffing, managerial and operational procedures in early 2001. A technical review of the\nProject  will  be  conducted  jointly  with  the  Government  two  years  after  loan  effectivity.  The\nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 13.\n\n4.\n\nReporting\n\n116. DOTCA  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  concerning  financial  aspects,\nprocurement  of  equipment  and  services,  the  design  and  preconstruction  activities,  and\nconstruction  of  all  civil  works  included  in  the  Project.  Project  implementation  consultants  will\nassist  in  this  reporting  responsibility.  DOTCA  will  furnish  ADB  with  the  proposed  annual  MTD\nbudget at a  date prior  to  its  submission  to  the  Government.  To facilitate postevaluation  of  the\nProject,  the  Government  will  provide  ADB,  within  three  months  of  physical  completion  of  the\nProject,  a  completion  report  that  will  comprehensively  cover  details  of  project  implementation,\ncosts  and  potential  benefits,  and  any  other  information  that  may  be  requested  by  ADB\nconcerning  the  Project.  The  Government  will  provide  quarterly  and  annual  reports  on  the\nnavigation aids trust account, activities, and expenditures, and on progress in taking appropriate\naction  to  approve  and  implement  the  sector  reorganization  initiatives,  transport  policy  and\nregulations, and organizational changes and progress achieved in strengthening DOTCA.\n\n \n\n5.\n\nAccounts\n\n117. DOTCA  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  accounts  for  all  expenditures  under  the\nProject. It will furnish ADB with accounts and related financial statements reflecting the accounts\nfor each project-related contract. These financial statements will be audited using international\nauditing  guidelines  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  financial  statements  together\nwith the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within nine months of the end of each related\nfiscal  year.  The  chief  project  management  consultant  will  keep  detailed  costing  of  project\ncomponents and help DOTCA report, as required.\n\n118.\nThe  accounting  capability  of  the  Department  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  currently\nresides within the Finance Branch of the Finance and Administration Division,  which has 16.  Of\nthese,  two  positions  are  vacant.  Three  new  positions  are  being  established.  Three  levels  of\naccounting qualification are recognized in the PNG public service: (i) certificate-level qualification,\nwhich  requires  one  year  of  postsecondary  formal  training;  (ii)  diploma  level,  which  requires  two\nyears  of  university  training;  and  (iii)  degree  level,  which  requires  two  years  in  addition  to  the\ndiploma-level  course,  for  a  total  of  four  years  tertiary  training.  Two  officers  within  the  DOTCA\nFinance  Branch  have  degree-level  qualifications.  Both  of  these  officers  are  also  accredited\nmembers of the professional body of the accounting profession in PNG. The assistant director of\nfinance,  appointed  to  manage  the  trust  account  and  the  Project's  financial  activities,  is  one  of\nthese two officers. Most staff are familiar  with computerized accounting operations through their\nexposure to the Government\u2019s central accounting system.\n\nThe accounts of Government departments in PNG continue to be run on a cash basis.\n119.\nThe  focus  of  accounting  activity  in  the  DOTCA  Finance  Branch  is  on  financial  accounting:\nensuring that monies received and expended are properly accounted for, that cash budgets are\n\n\f28\n\nproperly  prepared,  and  that  the  status  of  expenditures  and  receipts  against  budget  is  known.\nUnder  the  sector  restructuring  program,  support  will  be  required  to  focus  on  management\naccounting  including  service  costing,  pricing,  financial  planning,  and  development  and\nmonitoring financial performance  indicators.  The overall  assessment  indicates  that the  staff  of\nthe Finance Branch, supported by a consultant, are able to perform the financial management\ntasks  required  to  administer  the  Project,  but  needs  improvement  to  conduct  financing\nresponsibilities of the MSA.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n120. Under the proposed implementation arrangements, the Government will allocate annual\ncounterpart funds for expenditures for five  consecutive  years.  The disbursement  will  be  made\nfor  eligible  expenditures  under  ADB's  Disbursement  Guidelines  following  ADB's  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. Under the proposed implementation arrangements, all applications for\nwithdrawal for the disbursement of the loan funds for eligible expenditures will be carried out by\ndirect  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures,  and  through  an  imprest  account.  Specific\nrequirements  for  disbursement  procedures  under  the  Project  were  prepared  during  the\nAppraisal  Mission.  The  initial  amount  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  $300,000  and  maximum\npayment $50,000.\n\n7.\n\nTechnical Review\n\n121.\nIn addition to a schedule of biannual regular review meetings to monitor the progress of\nthe  Project,  a  technical  review  will  be  carried  out  two  years  after  the  Project  has  become\neffective. The review will focus on determining the need for deviations from the original project\ndesign or implementation arrangements, cost overruns, loan reallocations, and other factors, if\nany,  including  assumptions  and  risks  that  might  constrain  satisfactory  project  implementation\nand achievement of development objectives.\n\n8.\n\nProject Performance Evaluation\n\n122. DOTCA  will  compile  and  analyze  data  to  facilitate  project  performance  monitoring  and\nevaluation.  It  will  forward  this  information  to  ADB  and  the  Government  in  accordance  with  an\nagreed  schedule  of  performance  measurement  indicators.  A  proposed  set  of  measures  were\nagreed  during  the  Appraisal  Mission.  These  measures  aim  to  assess  the  macroeconomic\nimpact of the Project, and include three major groups of activities: (i) benchmarking, to provide\nDOTCA and the sector management with objective reference points for  impact evaluation  that\nrespond  to  the  needs  of  the  users  of  navigation  aids  and  shipping  industry;  (ii)  benefit\nmonitoring, to ensure that the project benefits  indeed accrue  to  the  users; and  (iii)  postproject\nperformance  and  benefit  evaluation,  to  assess  overall  Project  effectiveness.  The  agreed\nperformance indicators are given in Appendix 14.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\n123.\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental\nexamination  was  prepared  and  a  summary  is  a  supplementary  appendix.  Significant  negative\nenvironmental  effects  resulting  from  the  construction  activities  are  not  anticipated  as  the\nmajority of navigation aids already exist. The physical area that will be disturbed for construction\nof  new  navigation  aids  is  very  small.  By  their  very  nature,  navigation  aids  are  constructed  in\n\n\f29\n\nareas  where  the  risk  of  marine  accidents  is  greatest,  thus  these  installation  sites  are  actually\nsited to have a positive environmental effect by reducing the potential for marine accidents and\nresulting environmental destruction. A detailed environmental impact assessment is not needed.\n\n124. Negative  environmental  effects  during  construction  will  be  insignificant  provided\nstandard  construction  practices  and  specifications  are  adhered  to.  Contracts  will  include\nenvironmental  impact  mitigating  requirements  for  construction  methodologies,  equipment\nstandards, waste management, and emergency contingency planning. For offshore installations,\nconstruction  specifications  will  require  that  sites  and  anchoring  locations  for  the  construction\nbarges  be  inspected  to  identify  locations  that  will  result  in  minimal  impact  on  the  marine\nenvironment. Where onshore, construction access will be via established road or pathways, and\nwill avoid any sensitive ecological areas that may have been identified.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n125.\nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  social  impact  throughout  the  country.  It  will  improve\noverall  quality  of  life,  particularly  among  coastal  communities,  which  will  directly  benefit  from\nimproved maritime services. The Project will facilitate efficient and safe sea transport, increase\naccess  to  social  services,  and  reduce  cargo  transport  costs.  Specifically,  the  maritime\nimprovements  will  contribute  to  improved  access  to  schools,  medical  care,  and  markets,\nparticularly  for  isolated  rural  communities.  Community  surveys  and  consultations  indicate\nwidespread  beneficiary  support  for  the  Project.  They  understand  the  need  for,  and  value  of\nnavigation  aids  to  their  villages.  The  Project  also  includes  extensive  community  involvement.\nThrough  the  community  engagement  program,  the  communities  will  contribute  directly  to  the\nongoing  sustainability of  the  system  of  navigation  aids.  In  return,  the  communities  will  directly\nbenefit from the fee for  service  agreements.  No  relocation  or  resettlement  of  households  and\ngardens will be required for the Project. An initial social analysis is a supplementary appendix.\n\n3.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n126.\nThe  rehabilitation  works  under  the  Project  consist  of  restoration  works  on  the  existing\nstructures.  For  new  works,  land  needs  to  be  procured  or  acquired  through  land-lease\nagreements for the new navigation aids. The Project involves no relocation. As necessary, land\nwill  be  procured  for  project  purposes  by  the  Government  in  accordance  with  the  consultative\nand  legal  process  under  its  Land  Act.  The  Government  will  acquire  this  land  or  rights  to  the\nrequired \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  policy  on  resettlement\ncompensation10  and  provide  compensation  including  crop  compensation,  as  required,  in\naccordance with ADB's relevant guidelines. Detailed designs will be sensitive to minimizing land\nacquisition. The land acquisition program is in Appendix 15.\n\ntimely  basis \n\nlands  on  a \n\nThe  Government,  through  DOTCA  and  with  the  support  of  the  project  implementation\n127.\nconsultants, will identify a program to resolve outstanding land claims. An allowance has been\nincluded in project budget for land acquisition and for gradually clearing backlog land claims.\n\n                                                       \n10\n\nADB. 1998.

Of  these  three  options,  fixed\nnavigation aids are considered the most feasible option for PNG. Electronic systems rely on, and\ngenerally  complement,  a  well-functioning  navigation  aids  system,  not  replace  it.  The  use  of\nelectronic  systems  is  severely  constrained  by  inadequate  telecommunication  and  information\ntechnology  standards,  affordability,  maintenance  requirements,  and \nthe  poor  quality  of\nhydrographic charts. Compulsory pilotage is cumbersome and  impractical,  and still  relies on the\nprovision of a system of navigation aids.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n129.\nThe  economic  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project  are  estimated  by  comparing  the\nsituations  with  and  without  the  Project.  The  economic  costs  of  the  six  project  components\ninclude  all  incremental  costs  associated  with  project  implementation,  such  as  detailed\nengineering  and  civil  works,  equipment,  community  programs,  hydrographic  service,  training,\nsector reorganization, and operation and maintenance. The project benefits stem from two key\nimprovements:  the  Project  will  result  in  a  significant  reduction  in  voyage  times  due  to  faster\nsailings,  shorter  sailing  distances,  and  less  voyage  restrictions,  such  as  allowing  voyages  at\nnight  or  during  times  of  poor  visibility.  Secondly,  there  will  be  considerable  improvement  in\nmaritime  safety.  The  Project  will  increase  the  total  number  of  fixed  navigation  aids  in  the\nnetwork  from  the  present  166  to  201,  and  will  more  than  double  the  number  of  presently\noperable navigation aids in the network. Full  implementation  of  the technical,  institutional, and\nsocial  components  of  the Project  will  improve  the  sustained  availability  of  each  light.  The  key\neconomic benefits result from the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nimproved efficiency in the provision of existing maritime transport services; as a\nresult  of  reduced  voyage  times,  the  shipping  subsector  will  be  able  to  (a)\ntransport  the  same  cargo  and  passenger  volume  using  less  vessel  capacity  at\nless  cost,  or  (b)  transport  more  cargo  and  passengers  with  the  same  vessel\ncapacity and cost;\n\nincreased passenger time savings and overall convenience resulting from faster\nand potentially more frequent vessel services;\n\nreductions in onboard cargo costs due to faster transit through coastal waters;\n\nimproved delivery of goods and services to coastal communities that depend on\nmaritime modes of transport;\n\nexpanded  network  coverage  by  opening  new  channels,  and  providing  shorter\nand safer routes; and\n\n(vi) \n\nreduced maritime risks of accidents and loss of lives, goods, and equipment.\n\n\f31\n\n3. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\n130.\nThe  opportunity  costs  for  not  undertaking  the  Project  were  estimated  by  calculating  an\naverage cost of a vessel day at K5,000 per vessel day ($1,700). This assumed benefit from time\nsavings  were  calculated  only  for  registered  vessels  exceeding  15  meters.  Smaller  vessels\u2014\nabundant  and  a  primary  transport  mode  in  PNG\u2014would  benefit  from  the  project  outputs  and\nincrease  the  cumulative  project  benefits.  Benefits  from  avoided  accidents  have  been  estimated\nusing the Government\u2019s estimates for damage from its incident records.\n\n131. Comparison  of  the  benefits  of  the  with-project  situation  with  the  without-project  case,\nyielded considerable benefits to the PNG economy. The resulting economic internal rate of return\nobtained was 25.12 percent. The results of sensitivity analyses, given in Table 2, testing Project\nviability for primary parameters also demonstrates robust economic viability of the Project. Details\nof the economic analysis are in Appendix 16.\n\nSensitivity Test\n\nBase Case\n1. 20 percent increase in costs\n2. 20 percent decrease in benefits\n3. 1 year delay in construction schedule\n4. 30 percent depreciation of local currency\n5.

Indirect impacts include (i) more convenient,  safer,  more  reliable,  and  more frequent\nmaritime passenger and cargo service; (ii) improved access to markets in adjacent communities\nand on other islands for purchasing and selling goods (produce and handicrafts) and services;\n(iii)  improved  access  to  social  services,  especially  health  and  education  services;  and  (iv)\nformation of a viable community social structure (the core groups) with capacity to disseminate\ninformation  and  to  coordinate  village  activities  to  support  village  welfare  beyond  the  activities\nrequired  to  maintain  the  navigation  aids.  While  the  Government  supports  ceilings  to  shipping\nrates due to competition among shipping companies within specific coastal areas, the shipping\nindustry  is  expected  to  translate  improved  vessel  performance  into  an  enhanced  vessel  fleet\nand reductions in the freight and passenger rates. The Project will also provide for direct income\nto  the  landowning  families  and  communities  in  the  form  of  lease  payments  and  maintenance\nservice  fees.  It  will  engage  individuals  in  the  communities  to  do  maintenance  work  such  as\nwashing solar panels, cutting grass, and painting. These arrangements will be financed from the\nDOTCA annual budget and later from the MSA's budget.\n\n\f32\n\n134. Women\u2019s groups will be directly involved in monitoring project components through their\nmembership in the community core group. The main goal is the facilitation of mutually beneficial\ncommunity  participation  income  arrangements  between  the  government,  nongovernment  and\ncommunity-based  organizations,  and  communities.  This,  together  with  land-lease  payments,\nservice fees, and improvement in access to safer coastal transport, for both commercial vessels\nand passenger boats, will contribute to improved economic activities and reduced poverty in the\ntarget areas.\n\nThe  share  of  poor  among  the  total  population  in  the  project  catchment  area  is  40.2\n135.\npercent. When  compared  with  the national  poverty  ratio  37.5  percent,  the  Project  qualifies  as\npro-poor  and  a  poverty-reducing  intervention.  Detailed  description  of  the  direct  and  indirect\nbenefits on the poor has been prepared as a supplementary appendix.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n136.\nThe Project is not subject to any unusual risks. The main risks are (i) economic shocks\u2014\ndownturns  in  international  trade  and  the  economy,  and  (ii)  the  shortage  of  counterpart  funds.\nThe  risk  of  economic  shocks  has  been  reduced  as  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  recent\neconomic  policies.  With  regard  to  counterpart  funding,  the  Government's  current  policy\nemphasizes the importance of transport safety and effective utilization of existing infrastructure\nassets.  The  project  design  seeks  to  minimize  the  risk  of  insufficient  counterpart  funds  by\ncombining design features and preventive conditions. These include establishment of navigation\naids  trust  accounts  that  would  hold  revenues  from  the  light  dues  and  increasingly  finance\noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  navigation  aids  network.  Land  acquisition  issues  are\naddressed as one of the main project components; the Project aims to establish a system under\nwhich land acquisition claims would be paid under a more acceptable format  than  in  the past.\nThe  Project  also  addresses  important  endemic  challenges  to  establishing  efficient  maritime\nsafety  services,  including  the  need  to  resolve  institutional  issues  and  recurring  vandalism.\nThese risk areas were identified early in the project development process and realistic programs\nfor institutional change and community development have been devised in detail.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n137.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDOTCA will  disengage from  the operation  of  the navigation  aids  vessel Sepura\nby 30 April 2001.\n\nBy  30 April  2001, the  Government  will  submit  a  reorganization  plan  to  ADB  for\ndiscussion  outlining  the  proposed  statutory  authority  for  maritime  safety,  its\nfunctions,  responsibilities,  financial  autonomy,  power  for  collecting  fees  and\ncharges, staffing, and management.\n\nBy 30 September 2001, the Government  will  submit to the  National Parliament,\ntaking  into account  the  recommendations  made under project  support  to  sector\nreorganization,  a  bill  providing  for  establishment  of  a  statutory  authority  for\nmaritime safety.\n\n\f33\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIn  the  event  that  the  set  user  fees  do  not  adequately  cover  the  financial\nobligations  and  operations  of  the  established  statutory  authority  of  maritime\nsafety, the Government will finance any shortfall of funds to ensure effective and\nefficient operation and maintenance of the navigation aids system and provision\nof maritime safety services.\n\nThe  Government  will  clear,  or  will  finance  clearance  of,  the  backlog  of  land\ncompensation  claims  that  relate  to  land  occupied  by  the  navigation  aids\ninstallations.  The  schedule  will  be  gradual,  clearing  20  percent  per  annum,\ncommencing immediately after establishment of the authority.\n\nIn  the  event  of  compensation  and  involuntary  resettlement  arising  from  land\nacquisition  required  for  the  Project,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  such\nresettlement  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  Government\nguidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  policies and  procedures  on  resettlement;  and  (b)  all  land\nrequired for  the Project  will  nevertheless be acquired  and  compensation  issues\nresolved prior to approval of tender for the respective construction contracts.\n\n(vii)  DOTCA  will  issue  public  quarterly  reports  and  budgets  for  the  forthcoming\nquarters  on  collection  and  expenditures  made  from  the  navigation  aids  trust\naccount for the review of NAAC, in addition to its internal reporting requirements.\n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  maintain  a  dialogue  with  ADB  on  the  status  of  relevant\ntransport  issues,  including  maritime  safety  and  rescue  operations  and  plans,  oil\nspill  prevention,  tariffs  for  user  charges,  sector  funding,  institutional  organization,\nand external assistance.\n\n(ix) \n\nThe Government will budget adequate counterpart  funding of a  least K5.5  million\nper annum for project implementation in accordance with the financing plan.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n138.\n\nThe Government has agreed to the following conditions for loan effectiveness:\n\nThe  Government  will  establish  a  maritime  safety  trust  account  and  deposit\nrevenues from the navigation aids dues and the oil pollution levy to the account\nas  an  interim  measure  prior  to  Parliamentary  promulgation  of  an  autonomous\nMSA.\n\nThe  Government  will  have  approved  the  submission  to  the  Parliament  an  oil\npollution levy to recover costs of oil pollution prevention, detection, and capacity\nfor cleanup, which will be paid to the maritime safety trust account.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n139.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $20,600,000 to the Independent State\nof  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  Rehabilitation  of  the  Maritime  Navigation  Aids  System  Project\nfrom ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's\n\n\f34\n\npool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans and with an amortization period of\n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  five  years,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the\nBoard.\n\n17 August 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPRESIDENT\n\n\fNo.\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page , para.)\n\n35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nVessel Traffic and Cargo Volumes, 1989-1999\n\nProject Framework\n\nOrganization Chart\n\nMaritime Sector Restructuring Action Plan\n\nFinancial Analysis of the Maritime Safety Authority\n\nSchedule of Navigation Aids Fees\n\nOil Spill Levy\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Advisory Consulting\nServices for Reorganizing the Maritime Sector\n\nNavigation Aids Proposed for Repair, Replacement, or\nNew Construction By Year\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Project Implementation\nand Establishment of Hydrographic Services\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nTentative Contract Packages\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nProject Performance Report\n\nLand Acquisition Plan\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available upon request)\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nInitial Social Analysis\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n47\n\n48\n\n50\n\n53\n\n54\n\n61\n\n62\n\n63\n\n64\n\n67\n\n68\n\n1, 3\n\n4, 15\n\n8, 36\n\n13, 57\n\n14, 59\n\n15, 66\n\n17, 76\n\n22, 95\n\n22, 96\n\n24, 103\n\n24, 104\n\n26, 113\n\n27, 115\n\n28, 122\n\n29, 126\n\n31, 131\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nTargets\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanism\n\nRisks/\nAssumptions\n\n1.

Light dues\nfor both domestic and international vessels were recently increased effective 1 January 2000\nby  75  percent  to  K60  per  meter  for  vessels  paying  annually.  The  navigation  aids  dues  are\nexpected  to  remain  at  the  current  levels  until  2002,  and  that,  in  line  with  the  proposal  of  the\nDepartment of Transport and Civil Aviation (DOTCA), a POSL of K0.30 per net registered ton\n(nrt) per quarter will be introduced prior to the establishment of  the  Maritime  Safety  Authority\n(MSA).\n\nA  total  revenue  from  minor  sources  relating  to  services  of  the  MSA,  including  survey\n2.\nfees,  chart  sales,  and  vessel  registration  fees,  is  estimated  at  K0.16  million  in  2001.  These\nrevenues  are  assumed  to  grow  in  real  terms  at  the  same  rate  as  the  domestic  vessel  fleet.\nRevenue from hydrographic services (chart sales and the sale of data) is assumed to increase\nover  five  years  to  about  four  times  the  current  level,  reflecting  establishment  of  the  national\nhydrographic  capability  and  development  of  an  appropriate  pricing  regime.  All  charges  are\nadjusted every two years for inflation.\n\nCash balances held by the MSA are assumed to be invested from time to time and the\n3.\ninterest credited to the MSA\u2019s account. The interest rate on such investments is included at 5\npercent per annum.\n\n2. \n\nVessels Volumes\n\ni. \n\nInternational Vessels Calling at Papua New Guinea ports\n\nAll  commercial  international  vessels  calling  in  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  ports  are\n4.\nassumed to pay both the navigation aids dues (light dues) and the proposed POSL. Total calls\nof overseas vessels increased steadily from 1,179 in 1988 to 3,159 per annum in 1996, before\nthe Asian crisis precipitated a sharp decline to 2,347 in 1998. While official data for 1999 and\nthe first half of 2000 is not available, with recovery of most Asian economies a resurgence in\nvessel numbers can be confidently expected. The number of calls in 2001 has been assumed\nto be 3,147\u2014the same number as in 1997.\n\n5.\n Eighty percent of overseas vessel calls are assumed to be made by vessels paying the\nannual fee: the remainder of calls are by vessels paying on a per voyage basis. On average,\nthese vessels are assumed to make three calls per quarter. These assumptions are consistent\nwith the amount of revenue that has been collected from overseas vessels by the Papua New\nGuinea Harbour Board (PNGHB).\n\nii.\n\nKumul Oil Terminal\n\n6.\nBased on navigation dues payments for the last five years, 60 vessels use the Kumul\noil terminal each year. All vessels calling at the Kumul oil terminal pay their light dues on a per\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nvoyage basis, implying that individual vessels will not make more than three voyages per year.\nEach  vessel  is  therefore  assumed  to  pay  both  navigation  aids  dues  and  the  POSL  on  each\ncall.\n\niii.\n\nDomestic\n\n7.\nAbout 420 domestic vessels registered in PNG exceed 15 meters (m) in length, and are\nthus required to pay navigation aid dues. About 60 percent of these exceed 24 m in length\u2014\nthe  proposed  threshold  for  the  POSL.  Fifty  percent  of  the  vessels  required  to  pay  light  dues\nare assumed to pay the POSL.\n\n8.\nOverseas  and  international  vessels  average  3,231  nrt  and  553  nrt,  respectively.  A\nfigure of 60,000 per vessel\u2014appropriate for vessels averaging 240 m in length  was  used  for\ncallers at the Kumul oil terminal.\n\n3.\n\nVessel size\n\n4.\n\nGrowth rates\n\nOverseas  vessel  calls  are  estimated  to  increase  by  3.7  percent  per  year:  This  is  one\n9.\nhalf  of  the  geometric  average  growth  rate  experienced  during  1988-1998,  and  approximates\nthe  long-term  growth  rate  of  international  maritime  trade.  The  average  vessel  size  in\ninternational trade increases by 2 percent per annum. The growth rate for the domestic fleet is\nestimated at 1.7 percent, in line with experience of the last decade. Exports from the Kumul oil\nterminal were assumed to remain at their current level throughout the forecast period.\n\n5.\n\nEffectiveness of Revenue Collection\n\n10.\nEvidence  suggests  effectiveness  of  revenue  collection  can  be  improved.  The  Project\nincludes  components  aimed  at  enhancing  revenue  collection  effectiveness.  Experience  with\nthe  collection  of  similar  dues  in  other  countries  suggests  that,  if  properly  implemented,  the\npayment  of  light  dues  will  be  difficult  to  evade,  and  with  the  proposed  support,  a  very  high\nproportion of potential revenues can be realized. Eighty-five percent of the revenues due from\nlight  dues  and  the  POSL  are  assumed  to  be  collected  in  2001,  95  percent  in  2002,  and  99\npercent in 2003 and the subsequent years.\n\nB. \n\nAssumptions Operating Expenses Estimation\n\n1.\n\nSalary Costs\n\n11.\nA summary of all operating expenses is  given  in  Table  A5.  A  first  draft  organizational\nstructure for the MSA was developed to estimate staff costs. This structure includes a total of\n50 permanent positions: 17 less than the staff complement of the Maritime Division of DOTCA\n(excluding  the  crew  of  Kulasi  and  Sepura).  Salary  levels  within  the  Maritime  Safety  Branch\n(MSB)  are  low,  and  the  salary  scale  compressed.  As  a  result,  MSB  has  difficulty  retaining\nqualified and experienced staff  in  technical  and  managerial  positions.  This  problem  needs  to\nbe  addressed  if  the  MSA  is  to  be  effective.  Thus,  the  assumed  salaries  will  in  general  be\nhigher than those  currently  paid  by  MSB.  The  differential  is  higher  for  more  senior  positions,\nranging  from  20  percent  for  base  grade  administrative  support  staff  to  60  percent  at  senior\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\nexecutive  levels.  The  total  salary  and  benefit  costs  were  estimated  at  K1,291,000  per  year.\nSalary costs were assigned to cost centers within the MSA.\n\n2.\n\nCorporate Expenses\n\n12.\nCorporate  expenses  include  the  salaries  of  the  chief  executive  officer  as  well  as  the\nthree divisional directors, the salaries of other corporate services offices, including accounting\nstaff. The financial analysis also includes a K21,000 per year allowance for board fees, based\non a 7-member board meeting monthly and a sitting fee of K250 per day. Annual rental costs\nare estimated at K250,000 per year\u2014in line with current rental costs at K21,000 per month. An\nallowance  of  K70,000  per  year  for  office  expenses  includes  provision  for  30  desktop\ncomputers  and  10  networked  printers  with  a  replacement  cycle  of  three  years,  as  well  as\nK25,000 per year for general office expenses.\n\n3.\n\nNavigational Aids Maintenance Costs\n\n13.\nEstimates for the several nonsalary cost components for navigational aids maintenance\ninclude cost of  spare  parts,  estimated  at  K200,000  per  year,  and  cost  of  training  at  K50,000\nper year. A comprehensive review of efficient logistics for the MSA is included under the sector\nreorganization component of the Project. The logistics support would be purchased in a cost-\neffective way from private providers through a competitive process. Costs are based on a daily\nvessel hire rate of K4,500 per day  (inclusive  of  fuel),  and  helicopter  hire  rates  of  K2,400  per\nflying hour. The services of a navigation aids vessel would be required for 150 days per year,\nand helicopter flying time for  20 hours per year. A total  of  100  days  of  vehicle  hire  has  been\nallowed.  The  total  costs  of  logistics  support  for  navigational  aids  maintenance  has  therefore\nbeen estimated at K735,000 per year. The cost of training, transport, and spare parts for the\nnavigational aids are assumed from the Project for the duration of the Project. These expenses\nare therefore attributed to the MSA budget from 2006 onward.\n\n4.\n\nCommunity Program\n\nA community engagement program is a central to the strategy for reducing vandalism.\n14.\nFive  full-time  staff  positions  are  allocated  for  the  program  with  salary  costs  estimated  at\nK102,000  per  year.  An  allowance  of  K400,000  per  year  is  included  for  annual  lease  and\nlandowner services payments and K400,000 is included in each of the five years 2001 to 2005\nto finance clearing the backlog of land compensation claims. Travel and per diem associated\nwith  landowner  liaison,  training  in  maintenance  practices  of  community  groups,  and  public\ninformation  and  awareness  activities  have  been  included.  These  expenditures  peak  in  the\nearly years as the program is established, and stabilize at a lower level from 2004. The cost of\ncommunity maintenance contracts is estimated at K1,200 per year per site. Most sites, but not\nall, would be covered by community contracts. These are assumed to increase to 180 by 2004,\nand remain at that level thereafter.\n\n5.\n\nHydrographic Services\n\n15.\nHydrographic  services  are  provided  by  two  full-time  professional  staff  within  the\nhydrographic unit. the PNG Defense Force (PNGDF) will also assist the hydrographic  unit  by\nseconding  one  person.  Field  surveys  are  the  major  recurrent  cost  for  hydrographic  services.\nMSA will contract vessel services for 120 days per year with a daily charter cost of a suitable\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nvessel of K5,000 per day. This variable cost will vary with new field survey work subject to the\ncapacity to fund such surveys.\n\n16.\n Chart production costs of K40,000 per year in 2002,  rising  to  100,000  in  subsequent\nyears, has been assumed. Provisions of K20,000 per year for office expenses, and K150,000\nper  year  for  equipment  maintenance  and  replacement,  has  also  been  included  in  the\nhydrographic budget.\n\nField survey and all equipment costs are assumed to be met from project funds during\n17.\nthe  project  period  and  from  2006  will  become  the  responsibility  of  the  MSA.  Salaries,  chart\nproduction, and office costs will be met by the MSA from inception.\n\nThe financial analysis assumes that chart prices  are  set  at  a  level  that  will  fully  offset\n18.\nthe avoidable costs of chart production and distribution. The precise value assumed for chart\nproduction costs therefore has little effect on the overall outcome of the analysis.\n\n6.\n\nSurveys and Examination\n\n19.\nThe  majority  of  the  costs  associated  with  ship  surveys  and  examinations  are  salary\ncosts.  Due  to  DOTCA's  considerable  difficulty  in  retaining  qualified  ship  surveyors,  ship\nsurveyors\u2019 salaries are increased from 40 and 50 percent. A provision for training of K50,000\nper  year  is  also  included.  Effective  and  efficient  survey  function,  and  port  state  control,  will\nimply a significant amount of travel by ship surveyors, and a travel budget of K30,000 per year\nis thus provided\n\n7.\n\nOil Spill Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nDepreciation of the value of oil spill equipment is assumed at K3,500,000, reflecting the\n20.\nvalue of equipment purchased under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan program1 with\nan  eight-year  depreciation  period.  The  cost  of  oil  spill  response  activities  is  estimated  at\nK155,000 per year including salary and benefits. Office and administrative expenses to cover\ntelecommunications, stationery, office equipment, and travel are K180,000 in the first year.\n\n8. \n\nInflation\n\nC. \n\nOther Assumptions\n\n21.\n\nA uniform inflation rate of 5 percent per annum is assumed.\n\n22.\nThe principal asset of the new MSA will be the stock of existing navigation aids with a\nreplacement value of  K36.6  million  based  on  an  average  replacement  value  of  K300,000  for\nthe  122  existing  installations  not  be  replaced  under  the  Project.  The  assumed  written  down\nvalue  of  these  installations  is  50  percent  of  their  replacement  value.  The  value  of  newly\nreplaced or additional navigation aids has been added to the MSA\u2019s balance sheet as they are\nconstructed. Funding of these facilities has been treated as an equity injection. Depreciation of\nnavigation  aids  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  a  15-year  economic  life.  A  progressive\nreplacement or complete refurbishment of navigation aids not replaced during the Project has\n                                               \n1 Loan  1153/1154-PNG: Transport Infrastructure Development Project,  for  $69  million,  approved  on  14  January\n\n1992.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\nbeen  allowed  immediately  following  the  completion  of  the  Project,  i.e.,  from  2006.  Oil  spill\ncontrol  equipment  is  valued  at  K3.5  million.  No  allowance  has  been  included  in  the  opening\nasset base for any land, buildings, or office furnishing that may be transferred to the MSA. This\nomission is not expected to impact on any of the key findings of the analysis.\n\n23.\nIn  the  cash  flow  analysis,  80  percent  of  revenues  are  assumed  to  be  received  in  the\nyear  in  which  it  becomes  due,  and  90  percent  of  nondepreciation  expenses  are  paid  in  the\nyear in which they become due. It is assumed that the MSA will not pay tax or dividends to the\nGovernment.\n\nD. \n\nPrincipal Results of the Financial Analysis\n\nThe  financial  analysis  indicates  that  a  self-financing  MSA  is  a  realistic  objective.  To\n24.\nachieve this, a real increase of 25 percent in navigation aids dues will be necessary in 2002.\nEven with this increase, the level of dues would be reasonable by international standards.\n\n25. With this increase and modest trade growth, the MSA is able to maintain an adequate\ncash balance, while meeting all of its own operating and capital needs. The risk that a properly\nmanaged  MSA  will  need  to  make  demands  on  consolidated  revenue  funds  is  therefore  low.\nAlthough  the  cash  position  of  the  MSA  should  be  sound  from  the  outset,  it  will  not  become\nconsistently profitable until around 2008. The strong projected cash position during the second\ndecade of operation suggests scope for real price reductions, or alternatively for the payment\nof a dividend to the Government during this period.\n\n26.\nThe MSA will create benefits to the broader community as well as the shipping industry.\nIn  particular,  the  hydrographic  services  and  the  MSA\u2019s  contribution  to  search  and  rescue\noperations  could  be  recognized  by  a  transparent  subsidy  from  Government.  However,  this\nwould  make  the  MSA\u2019s  finances  again  dependent,  in  part,  on  the  Government  budgetary\nprocess,  which  could  place  at  risk  many  of  the  Project's  benefits.  No  explicit  subsidy  is  thus\nassumed. It does, however, set rates and charges to the shipping industry at levels that, while\nthey  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  to  ensure  the  financial  autonomy  of  the  MSA,  yield  a\nsubcommercial  rate  of  return.  Under  these  price  assumptions,  the  return  on  equity  would\nstabilize  during  the  second  decade  of  operations  at  around  6  percent  per  annum.

international  vessels  calling  in  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  ports  are\n1.\nassumed to pay the levy. Total overseas commercial vessel calls increased steadily from 1,179\nin  1998  to  3,159  per  annum  in  1996,  before  the  Asian  crisis  precipitated  a  sharp  decline  to\n2,347  in  1998.  Although  official  data  for  1999  and  the  first  half  of  2000  is  not  available,  with\nrecovery  now  established  in  most  Asian  economies  a  resurgence  in  vessel  numbers  can  be\nconfidently expected. The number of calls in 2001  has  been assumed  to  be  3,147\u2014the  same\nnumber as in 1997. It is assumed that overseas vessels make, on average, 3 calls per quarter.\nSixty  vessels  use  the  Kumul  oil  terminal  per  year,  all  of  which  pay  their  light  dues  on  a  per\nvoyage basis, implying that individual vessels make  less  than  three  voyages per  year.  The  oil\nspill  levy  would  therefore  assumed  be  paid  on  each  call.  About  420  domestic  vessels  are\nregistered in PNG, of which 60 percent exceed 24 meters (m) in length. About 50 percent of the\nregistered fleet has been used in the revenue estimates.\n\nB.\n\nVessel size and Growth Rates\n\n2.\nAverage net registered tonnages (nrts) for overseas and international vessels are 3,231\nand  553,  respectively.  Vessels  calling  at  Kumul  oil  terminal  are  60,000.  Calls  by  overseas\nvessels  are  assumed  to  grow  by  3.7  percent  per  annum.  The  average  vessel  size  in  the\ninternational trade increases by 2 percent per annum.\n\nC.\n\nCosts\n\n3.\nThe purchase value of oil spill equipment is K3.5 million. The depreciation period of eight\nyears was retained. Staff costs are K180,000 per  year  including  salary  and  benefits based  on\nsix full-time equivalent positions with an average full-time remuneration package of K30,000 per\nyear. An allowance of 10 percent has been included to cover office and administrative expenses\nadding about K116,000 to the  budget  in  the first  year.  An  inflation  allowance of 5  percent per\nannum has been included in the estimation of all future cost components. Costs relating directly\nto individual incidents are generally recoverable from the responsible party. The majority of the\ncosts  included  in  the  analysis  are,  therefore,  associated  with  maintaining  the  response\ncapability, and are, as a consequence, fixed. The anticipated increase in ship traffic will result in\nincreased  revenues,  while  it  will  not  add  significantly  to  the  agency\u2019s  costs.  The  analysis,\ntherefore, assumes that the levy will be held constant in nominal terms throughout the forecast\nperiod, despite the increase in inflation.\n\nD.\n\nRevenue Collection\n\n4.\nThe proposed levy should be collected along with light dues. The analysis has assumed\nthat 85 percent of the revenue would be collected in 2001, rising to 95 percent in 2002 and to 99\npercent thereafter.\n\n\fTable A7: Estimated Costs and Revenues Associated with the Prevention, Detection, and Remediation of Oil Spills\n\nItem\nOil Spill Levy Revenue\n   Domestic revenue\n   International revenue\nTotal Revenue\n\nOil Spill Prevention Cost\n   Equipment storage and maintenance\n   Training (incl. travel and subsistence)\n   Casual labor\n   Materials, supplies, transport, & fuel\n   Spare parts\n   Membership of intl. organizations\n   Publications\n   Consultancy\n   Resource mapping fund\n  Equipment contingency fund\n  Departmental staff\n  Administrative & office overhead\n Depreciation\nTotal Expenses\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n      118,453       168,371       191,909       224,544       245,595       274,865       300,633       305,876       334,551       340,385\n    1,782,276     2,043,094     2,185,231     2,244,314     2,306,524     2,372,029     2,441,000     2,513,624     2,590,092     2,670,608\n    1,900,729     2,211,465     2,377,140     2,468,858     2,552,119     2,646,894     2,741,634     2,819,500     2,924,642     3,010,993\n\n        30,000         31,500         33,075         34,729         36,465         38,288         40,203         42,213         44,324         46,540\n        80,000         84,000         88,200         92,610         97,241       102,103       107,208       112,568       118,196       124,106\n      200,000       210,000       220,500       231,525       243,101       255,256       268,019       281,420       295,491       310,266\n      100,000       105,000       110,250       115,763       121,551       127,628       134,010       140,710       147,746       155,133\n        80,000         84,000         88,200         92,610         97,241       102,103       107,208       112,568       118,196       124,106\n        25,000         26,250         27,563         28,941         30,388         31,907         33,502         35,178         36,936         38,783\n        15,000         15,750         16,538         17,364         18,233         19,144         20,101         21,107         22,162         23,270\n      120,000       126,000       132,300       138,915       145,861       153,154       160,811       168,852       177,295       186,159\n      150,000       157,500       165,375       173,644       182,326       191,442       201,014       211,065       221,618       232,699\n      180,000       189,000       198,450       208,373       218,791       229,731       241,217       253,278       265,942       279,239\n      180,000       189,000       198,450       208,373       218,791       229,731       241,217       253,278       265,942       279,239\n      116,000       121,800       127,890       134,285       140,999       148,049       155,451       163,224       171,385       179,954\n      482,500       492,150       501,993       512,033       522,274       548,387       575,807       604,597       634,827       666,568\n    1,758,500     1,831,950     1,908,783     1,989,162     2,073,259     2,176,922     2,285,769     2,400,057     2,520,060     2,646,063\n\n4\n9\n\nNet Revenue\n\n      142,229       379,515       468,357       479,696       478,860       469,971       455,865       419,443       404,583       364,930\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n2\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 8, page 1\n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR\nADVISORY CONSULTING SERVICES FOR REORGANIZING THE MARITIME SECTOR\n\nStrengthening the Executing Agency for Project Implementation\n\nA.\n\n1.\n\nResponsibilities include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAdvise  and  help  manage  a  trust  fund  under  control  of  the  Maritime  Division\n(MTD) to finance the operation and maintenance of the navigation aids; support\npreparation  of  related  budgets  and  reporting  procedures;  and  train  financial\nmanagers  in  effective  management  of  the  account,  budgeting,  expensing,  and\nreporting  on  the  activities  of  the  trust  fund.

Standard arrears will be paid in\nadvance of signing leases for the navigation aids sites. Of the existing 166 navigation aids sites,\ncompensation claims have been received from 49 landowners. Many of these do not provide a\npractical  basis  for  resolving  the  issue.  Litigation  to  resolve  them  would  be  with  lengthy  and\nunaffordable delays. Consequently, under the Project, all navigation aids sites, whether a claim\nhas been lodged or not, will be treated on an equal basis, i.e., a standard arrears payment be\noffered for every existing site.\n\n2.\nThe  acquisition  of  land  access  rights  by  the  Government  will  be  progressively\nimplemented as navigation aids are either rehabilitated or newly constructed over the five-year\nimplementation period. The steps required to gain the rights and access to land required under\nthe Project are summarized in Table A15.\n\nTable A15: Land Acquisition Plan\n\nthe  Lands  Department  of \n\nActions\n1.  The  implementation  consultant  and  the  Maritime  Transport  Division  (MTD)\nnotify \nto  commence  navigation  aids\nrehabilitation and construction work on identified sites during the current year.\nAn indicative  5-year schedule  of  planned construction  activities,  which  is subject\nto  revision,  is  also  presented  to  the  Lands  Department  at  the  start  of  the\nimplementation period, and is updated annually.\n\nintention \n\nTime Period\nThe start of each\nimplementation year\n\n2. Identify a core group in each affected community, and develop close liaison\nbetween the core group, provincial authorities, and the MTD.\n\nOne month\n\n3. Appoint a provincial lands department representative(s) assisted by a\nrepresentative of MTD to conduct a survey of the land required at each site, and\nconduct a geneology investigation to determine the identities of the legitimate and\nrecognized owners of the land.\n\nOne week\n\n4. Document the land investigation reports and have them endorsed by authorized\nagencies, i.e., the provincial administrator, valuer-general, and Provincial Affairs.\n\nOne month\n\n5. Issue a valuation certificate by the valuer general, Lands Department, on the\nbasis of the survey report.\n6. Prepare a standard lease agreement that, in the case of an existing navigation\naid site, will include provision for advance payment of a standard charge covering\narrears.\n\nOne month, concurrent\nwith step 4.\nOne week\n\n7. If the landowner(s) agree with the conditions of the lease, appoint a provincial\nlands department representative(s) to attend the site to promulgate the lease\nagreement with the identified land owners. The function of the core group and\nprovincial authorities at this point of the process is to facilitate agreement of\nlandowners to the standard lease terms.\n\nOne week\n\n8. If the landowner(s) disagree with the lease conditions and refuse to sign the\nagreement, convene the core group with support from provincial authorities as\nrequired to resolve issues and obtain voluntary landowner agreement.\n9. The core group will administer all payments for land lease, arrears, and\nnavigation aids maintenance and security services to the proper individuals.\n\nUp to three months\n\nRecurrent\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 16, page 1\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nThe  Project  includes  (i)  sector  reorganization,  (ii)  installation  or  rehabilitation  of  198\n1.\nnavigation  aids,  (iii)  establishment  of  a  self-reliant  hydrographic  service,  (iv)  training,  (v)\ncommunity  engagement  program,  and  (vi)  support  to  project  management.  The  capital\ninvestment  includes  lighting  of  two  new  shipping  routes  along  the  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)\ncoast\u2014Nuakata and Nessup channels.\n\n2.\nThe  least-cost  analysis  of  the  Project  has  considered  three  alternative  technologies  to\nmeet  the  required  safety  and  efficiency  improvements  for  maritime  navigation:  (i)  fixed\nnavigational  visual  and  radar  aids,  (ii)  electronic  navigation  systems,  and  (iii)  compulsory\npilotage.  Economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  comparing  the  with-project  and  without-\nproject alternatives.\n\nB.\n\nLeast-Cost Alternatives\n\n1.\n\nFixed Navigational Visual Aids\n\nTraditionally,  maritime navigation has  relied exclusively  on  visual  sightings  to  establish\n3.\nvessel position.  For coastal  navigation,  natural  or  artificially  derived  visual,  and  more  recently\nradar, aids located on land or water mark navigable channels and warn of submerged hazards,\nwhile  celestial  aids\u2014the  sun,  moon,  and  stars\u2014have  been  used  to  navigate  through  open\nwaters. For several centuries, purposefully constructed navigation aids have been the mainstay\nof coastal maritime navigation, guiding vessels through shallow and difficult waters. Worldwide,\nnetworks of navigation aids remain a primary coastal navigation tool.\n\nCurrent navigation aids technology includes the use of high intensity, low voltage electric\n4.\nlighting  systems.  Most  navigation  aids  are  solar  powered,  and  capable  of  providing  high\nperformance light without the need for costly refueling. The navigation aids  generally  allow for\nseveral  years\u2019  operability  with  minimal  annual  or  semiannual  maintenance.  Structures\nsupporting the navigation aids are usually simple in design:  concrete pile  structures  located  in\nshallow water, floating buoys in deeper water, or towers on land.\n\n5.\nNavigation  aids  provide  visual  signals  to  mariners,  enabling  them  to  fix  position,  and\nguide  them  through  difficult  waters  or  into  port.  In  addition,  some  navigation  aids  incorporate\nradar transponder beacons (racons), allowing mariners to sight navigation aids in poor visibility.\nA navigation aids system is fundamental to maritime navigation, and its use is second nature to\nall  mariners.  Every  maritime  nation  maintains  a  navigation  aids  system;  this  is  considered  an\ninternational obligation.\n\n2.\n\nElectronic Navigation Systems\n\nAdvancements  over  the  past  two  decades  have  resulted  in  use  of  global  positioning\n6.\nsystems (GPS) by the maritime industry. Based on satellite technology, these systems provide\naccurate  positioning  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Where  coastal  hydrographic  charts  are\naccurate, commercially available GPS systems can establish positions in charted waters to an\naccuracy  of  a  few  meters.  Use  of  a  GPS  system  requires  commensurately  accurate\nhydrographic charts and provision of a GPS receiver system on board vessels.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\nIn practice, the system relies on the functioning of sophisticated equipment and accurate\n7.\ncoastal  charts.  The  charts  available  for  PNG\u2019s  coastal  waters  are  not  sufficiently  accurate  to\npermit reliance on a GPS for practical navigation purposes. Moreover, systems such as this fail\noccasionally, and backup systems must be concurrently available. For this reason, and due to\nmariners\u2019 instinctive reliance on visual sightings, GPS and other similar electronic systems are\nalways  complemented  by  a  fully  functioning  navigation  aids  network  of  navigation  aids.  Even\nwith  the  most  sophisticated  onboard  GPS  system,  mariners  always  check  vessel  position\nthrough visual sightings, wherever possible.\n\n8.\nThese systems are, therefore, complementary and additional to a network of navigation\naids, and are not an alternative to fixed navigation aids. This is the case even in the most highly\ndeveloped  nations,  where  navigation  aids  continue  to  play  a  key  role  in  maritime  navigation.\nThis  is  particularly  relevant  in  PNG,  due  to  the  low  level  of  technological  capabilities,\naffordability constraints, maintenance difficulties, and poor quality of hydrographic charts.\n\n3.\n\nCompulsory Pilotage\n\n9.\nIn  areas  of  difficult,  complex,  or  crowded  waters,  the  use  of  pilots  is  sometimes\ncompulsory. In this case, a specially trained pilot will take control of a vessel and steer it through\na  specified area.  Pilots are  considered  experts  in  their  jurisdictional  waters,  often  to  the  point\nthat  they  no  longer  need  the  guidance  of  local  navigation  aids.  It  is  theoretically  possible\ntherefore, that a comprehensive system of compulsory pilotage could be established to replace\nnavigation aids over part or all of the system.\n\nIn practice, however, compulsory pilotage would clearly be impractical as a replacement\n10.\nfor  the  entire  network  of  navigation  aids.  First,  pilots  still  need  to  rely  on  navigation  aids,  no\nmatter how experienced they are in certain areas. Second, with over 7,000 recorded sailings per\nyear of larger ships alone, the pilotage capacity required to avoid navigational bottlenecks would\nbe far greater than could be achieved in practice.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe provision of a network of navigation aids is considered a viable option. It provides a\n11.\nreliable,  low-technology  solution,  which  has  proven  sustainability  and  applicability  to  PNG.  A\nnetwork  of  navigation  aids  currently  exists  within  PNG,  and  with  careful  rehabilitation,\nexpansion,  and  support  can  provide  a  long-term  solution  for  navigational  needs.  While  the\nprovision of GPS or similar systems may be appropriate for PNG in the future, it should be seen\nonly  to  complement  a  navigation  aids  network,  not  replace  it.  The  alternative  of  exclusive\ncompulsory pilotage is not considered a viable option, and would also only complement parts of\nthe  network,  not  replace  it.  In  conclusion,  establishing  and  maintaining  a  navigation  aids\nnetwork  is  the  least-cost  technically  acceptable  option  to  provide  the  required  navigational\nimprovements.  Project activities  have  therefore  focused  on  the  development  of  an  affordable,\nappropriate system for the existing maritime sector.\n\nC.\n\nProject Costs\n\n12.\nThe  project  costs  for  economic  evaluation  comprise  civil  works  construction  costs,\nequipment for navigation aids, establishment of the hydrographic services, community program,\nsector  reorganization  and  project  management,  physical  contingencies,  and  incremental\noperation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  costs  were  derived  from  their  estimation  in  financial\nterms  on  the  basis  on  unit  rates  for  all  items  of  works  that  reflect  experience  under  past\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 16, page 3\n\ncontracts, international experience, and quotations for  the  lighting  and battery  equipment.  The\nfinancial cost values have been adjusted to economic values by extracting taxes and duties, and\nby  applying  conversion  factors  for  local  labor  of  0.85  and  0.96  for  technical  nontraded\ncomponents.\n\nOverall, benefits from the Project  primarily  stem from  two  key  improvements.  First,  the\n13.\nProject will result in significant reductions in voyage times due to faster sailings, shorter sailing\ndistances (in some cases), and in less voyage restrictions (such as allowing voyages at night or\nduring  times  of  poor  visibility).  Second,  there  will  be  considerable  improvements  in  maritime\nsafety.  Third,  vessel  cost  savings  have  been  estimated  from  the  opening  of  the  two  new\nchannels. Fourth, safety and fishing industry improvements resulting from improved surveys and\nhydrographic  charts  have  been  estimated.  The  Project  will  increase  the  total  number  of  fixed\nnavigation  aids  in  the  network  from  166  presently  to  201,  and  will  approximately  double  the\nnumber  of  presently  operable  navigation  aids  in  the  network.  Full  implementation  of  the\ntechnical, institutional, and social recommendations of the Project will dramatically improve the\nsustained availability of each light. The key economic benefits resulting from the Project include\nthe following:\n\n(i) \n\nimproved efficiency in the provision of existing maritime transport services; due to\nreduced voyage times, the shipping sector will be able to (a) transport the same\ncargo and passenger volume using less vessel capacity at commensurately less\ncost, or (b) transport more cargo and passengers with the same vessel capacity\nand cost;\n\n(ii) \n\nincreased passenger time savings and overall convenience resulting from faster\nand potentially more frequent vessel services;\n\n(iii) \n\nreductions in onboard cargo costs due to faster transit through coastal waters;\n\n(iv) \n\nimproved delivery of goods and services to coastal communities that depend on\nmaritime modes of transport;\n\n(v) \n\nexpanded network coverage; and\n\n(vi) \n\nreduced maritime risks of accidents and loss of lives, goods, and equipment.\n\n1.\n\nVoyage Cost Savings\n\n14.\nCurrently, the industry suffers from (i) inefficient routings between ports made necessary\nto avoid poorly marked hazards along more direct routes; (ii) longer than necessary layovers in\nports  to  make  sailing  times  coincide  with  daylight  hours  and  ideal  visual  conditions;  and  (iii)\nslower speeds to accommodate inadequate knowledge and warnings about the precise location\nof  hazards.  The  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency  by  reducing  current  constraints,  and\nenabling faster sailings, shorter sailing distances, and less voyage restrictions. Quantification of\nthis  benefit  has  been  performed  as  follows;  (i)  estimating  the  indicative  annual  cost  of  major\nmaritime shipping services in PNG, (ii) estimating overall cost savings as a result of the Project,\nand  (iii)  performing  an  economic  analysis  to  determine  economic  viability  gained  from  the\nbenefit. The estimate is based on calculating the economic cost of an average vessel day, and\nmultiplying this by the estimated number of vessel days within the sector (Table A16.1).\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\nTable A16.1: Total Shipping Cost Estimate (Economic Values, K)1\n\nParameter\nNumber of Vessels in PNG watersa\n\nNumber of working days per vessel/\nyear\nTotal number of working days\n\nCost per working day per vesseld\nTotal indicative cost/year\n\nAssumption\n\nCoastal (domestic) vesselsb\nInternational vesselsc\nTotal\nCoastal (locally registered) vessels\nInternational (in PNG waters)\nCoastal: 180 days x 420 vessels\nInternational: 90 days x 80 vessels\nTotal\nAverage\n82,800 vessel days x K5,000 per day\n\n420\n 80\n500\n180 days/yr\n 90 days/yr\n75,600 days/yr\n 7,200 days/yr\n82,800 days/yr\n\n             5,000 vessel-day\n\nK414,000,000\n\nSource: PNG Harbours Board.\n\nPNG=Papua New Guinea.\na  Registered vessels exceeding 15 meter (m) length are included in the estimate.\nb Source: Register of Vessels of Maritime Transport Division.\nc\nd  Costs per vessel-day depend  upon the  size  of  ship, its  workload, and its  condition.  Typical costs  range  between\nK3,000 (vessels less than 50 m length) to K10,000 (larger vessels). An average of K5,000 per vessel-day has been\nassumed. Financial cost of a vessel-day is derived from the standard operating cost of $2,000 for a coastal vessel\nof 50 m and of 1,500-2,000 tons, inclusive of fuel, lubricant oils, crew costs, insurance, and depreciation.\n\n15.\nThe economic costs of commercial fleets operating in PNG waters computes to a total of\nK414 million ($145 million) annually. This is an indicative cost to transport the 4.7 million tons of\ncargo and 365,000 passengers2 annually to, from, and within PNG.\n\n16.\nIn practice, the actual cost to  the  nation  will  most  likely  be  significantly  higher.  Several\nvessel groups do not register all shipping movements, such as many of the logging and fishing\nvessels. In addition, smaller vessels (less than 15 meter length) have not been included in the\nestimate. Also, conservatism has been used in estimating the number and cost of working days\nin the calculation (para. 15),  especially  in estimating  the average number  of  working days  per\nvessel  per  year.  It  is  concluded  therefore,  that  an  estimate  of  K414  million  ($145  million)  is\nconservative.\n\n17.\nA consensus view among shipping companies is that a fully rehabilitated navigation aids\nnetwork  would  enable  an  overall  improvement  in  transport  efficiency  of  up  to  20  percent  by\ncompanies that use the most heavily traveled routes (e.g., Port Moresby-Lae). This is reinforced\nby  the  industry\u2019s  universal  acceptance  and  enthusiasm  for  the  Project.  For  the  purposes  of\neconomic  analysis,  an  efficiency  benefit  to  maritime  transport  of  2  percent  is  assumed.  This\nassumption  is  considered  appropriate  as  a  conservative  industry  average.  The  assumed  2\npercent efficiency benefit equates to an overall benefit of K8.3 million ($2.9 million) per year to\nthe industry. There is also a high level of confidence that this benefit estimate is conservative,\nand that the actual benefit is significantly higher. First, not all vessel movements are included in\nthe estimate, which would naturally increase overall costs thereby increasing the level of benefit.\nSecond,  the  analysis  only  considers  savings  in  direct  shipping  costs,  and  not  the  additional\nbenefits  of  passenger  time  savings;  onboard  cargo  cost  savings  due  to  faster  transit,  or  the\nimproved  delivery  of  goods  and  services  to  coastal  communities  that  depend  on  maritime\nmodes of transport. Third, the analysis does not account for vessel movement growth over the\nplanning period.\n                                                       \n1\n\nShipping costs are estimated on a gross output basis and do not compare with the share of transport services of\ngross domestic product, which is calculated on a value-added basis.\n\n2 Source: PNG Harbours Board (1998).\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 16, page 5\n\n2.\n\nSafety Improvements\n\n18.\nAn  improved and  expanded  navigation aids  system  will  considerably  improve  maritime\nsafety.  An  analysis  of  an  incident  rate  and  quantification  of  the  associated  economic  cost\nrequired:  (i)  a  review  of  incident  records  for  PNG  and  identification  of  incidents,  which  can\nreasonably  be  attributed  to  current  navigation  aids  deficiencies,  and  (ii)  estimation  of  the\ncumulative economic benefit of preventing such incidents.\n\nAlthough  there  are  no  recent  Government  records  of  PNG  maritime  incidents,\n19.\ninformation  is  available  for  a  number  of  shipping  accidents  within  PNG  over  the  previous\ndecade.3  In  total, available  records have  been  reviewed  for  29  maritime  incidents  within  PNG\nwaters over the last eight years (1991-1998). Of these, 13 incidents have been determined to be\ncaused  wholly  or  partially  by  navigational  error.  A  summary  of  type  of  vessel  and  estimated\naccident cost is in Table A16.2.\n\nTable A16.2: Estimate of the Cost of Accidents Related to Poor Navigation aids in PNG\n1990-2000\n\nYear\n1991\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1993\n1993\n1993\n1994\n1994\n1994\n1995\n1998\n1998\n\nAccident\n\nAdhijuna Nugraha\u2014grounded\nMaritime Hibiscus\u2014grounded\nHand Cheong\u2014ran aground, heavy damage\nArmstrong\u2014ran aground in WNB\nCarlina\u2014ran aground, superficial damage\nPixy May\u2014ran aground\nTenyu Maru\u2014grounded\nDasa Sebelas\u2014grounded\nPapuan Chief\u2014grounded, heavy damage\nSamsun Brave\u2014grounded and sank, with 10 lives\nArmada Kasturi\u2014grounded\nNiugini Coast\u2014grounded\nStar Sun\u2014grounded and sank\nTotal\n\nWNB=West New Britain.\nSource: Lloyds Data.\n\nType of\nVessel\n\nLogs\nBulk carrier\nLogs\n\nLogs\n\nContainer\nFishing boat\nLogs\n\nLogs\n\nEstimated\nCost (K)\n100,000\n250,000\n150,000\n25,000\n15,000\n50,000\n50,000\n150,000\n250,000\n3,000,000\n50,000\n10,000\n1,000,000\n5,100,000\n\n20.\nTable A16.2 provides an indicative amount of the likely direct costs of the 13 incidents.\nSome  of  the  reported  incidents  were  only  minor  such  as  temporary  grounding,  whereas  the\nsinking in 1994 of the Samsun Brave resulted in the tragic loss of 10 lives plus the material loss\nof vessel and cargo. A conservative estimate of the total cost of all 13 incidents is K5.1 million\n($1.785 million). This equates to an average annual cost of approximately K0.64 million ($0.22\nmillion) per year.\n\n21.\nIn  practice,  the  available  maritime  incident  records  reviewed  represent  only  a  small\nfraction of total incidents occurring throughout PNG from 1991 to 1998. It therefore follows that\nthe  incidents  (13  incidents)  and  the  associated  annual  cost  of  K0.64  million  attributable  to\nnavigation  aids  deficiency  of  navigation  aids  (Table  A16.2)  are  also  grossly  underestimated.\n72\nAlso, the sample does not take into account the potential for a large maritime accident, such as\na passenger ferry or oil tanker sinking, both of which could result in major economic costs and\ntragic  human  and  environmental  losses.  Conversely,  it  can  be  argued  that  not  all  of  the  13\n\n                                                       \n3  Source: Shipping incident records of Lloyds.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 16, page 6\n\nincidents  analyzed  can  be  directly  attributable  to  deficiencies  of  the  navigation  aids.  In  other\nwords, even if the navigation aids system as proposed is not installed and functioning correctly,\na number of these incidents could still occur.\n\nThe  net  effect  therefore  is  that  there  have  most  likely  been  a  greater  number  of\n22.\naccidents  than  those  analyzed,  which  were  in  some  way  attributable  to  navigation  aids\ndeficiency, but that a proportion of those accidents would have occurred anyway, regardless of\nsystem  effectiveness.  For  the  purposes  of  analysis,  it  is  assumed  that  the  projected  loss  of\nK0.64  million  ($0.22  million) annually  is a  realistic  estimate  of  cost due  primarily  to navigation\naids system deficiency. This forms the basis of the economic benefit relating to maritime safety\nof the project proposals.\n\n3.\n\nEconomic Analysis of New Channels\n\n23.\nTwo  new  routes  will  be  established  under  the  Project:  (i)  Nuakata  Channel  to  the\nsoutheast  of  the  mainland  and  on  the  heavily  traveled  route  between  Port  Moresby  and  Lae;\nand  (ii)  Nessup  Channel,  to  the  west  of West  New  Britain and on  the  route  between  Lae  and\nKimbe and Rabaul. The first links major ports on the mainland, and the latter links a major port\non the mainland with two busy ports on New Britain Island.  The new routes were endorsed by\nthe Navigation Aids Advisory Committee (NAAC).\n\n24.\nNuakata  channel  would  serve  as  an  alternative  to  Raven  Channel  for  vessels\nproceeding  between  Port  Moresby  and  Lae.  A  survey  of  the  area  conducted  by  the  Royal\nAustralian Navy in 1991 indicates that the channel is relatively free from navigational hazards.\nThe recommended navigation aids include (i) new Hibwa light with a range of 10 nautical miles\n(nm) on the southern tip of Hibwa Reef, (ii) a 10-mile light with Racon on Badila-Dadubona, (iii)\na  5  mile-light  and  radar  reflector  on  Bagshaw  Patch,  (iv)  a  5-mile  light  and  radar  reflector\nNuakata West Spit, (v) radar reflector on northeast Hawki Hawki Shoal, (vi) a radar reflector on\nGypsy Shoal,  and  (vii)  radar  reflector on  Nibor  Reef.  These  aides  will provide good  visual aid\ncoverage  of  the  channel and  a  radar  beacon  will  assist  mariners  to  locate  the  southern  entry\npoint.\n\nThe new channel (i) will be a significantly safer route than the  passage  through  Raven\n25.\nChannel,  (ii)  is  a  significantly  shorter  (165  nm)  route  than  the  alternative  safe  passage  via\nJomard Strait; and (iii) lighting will provide a nighttime alternative passage for vessels in transit\nfrom Port Moresby to Lae and return. A minimum of 400 commercial vessel movements occur\nbetween  Port  Moresby  and  Lae  per  year.  Under  the  assumptions  that  (i)  70  percent  of  traffic\nnow  avoids  Raven  Channel  and  adopts  the  longer  safer  route;  (ii)  approximately  280  vessel\nmovements at an  average saving of  165  nautical  miles  would  result  from  the  use  of  Nuakata\nChannel; (iii) the average service speed of vessels is 10 knots; and (iv) the average economic\noperating cost of a vessel of the size and class that typically use the strait is K10,000 per day\n(K416 per hour), the total annual benefit of the route to shipowners is K1.9 million per annum.4\n\n26.\nNessup  Channel  is  an  alternative  route  for  vessels  proceeding  between  Lae  and  the\nNew  Britain  ports  (Kimbe  and  Rabaul).  This  is  a  significant  coastal  route  used  by  both\npassenger ferries and commercial cargo vessels. The following aids are proposed: (i) a pile with\nradar reflector on the shoal adjacent to Nessup Island, (ii) a light with range 10 nautical miles on\nNessup Island with red, white, and green sectors to the south, (iii) a 4-mile port hand (red) light\nand radar reflector on northwest Shoal, (iv) a 4-mile light starboard hand (green) light and radar\n\n                                                       \n4  Direct vessel operating costs = 280*(165/10) = 4,620 hours saved per year, or K1.9 million per annum.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 16, page 7\n\nreflector on southeast Shoal, (v) a light with range 10 nm on Cape Gloucester Reef to mark off-\nlying dangers on the route from Nessup Channel to Kimbe. This regime of aids will provide good\nvisual aid coverage of the channel and facilitate its use at night.\n\nNessup Channel (i) is a significantly  shorter  route  between  Lae  and Kimbe  Rabaul;  (ii)\n27.\nfeatures fixed structures marking the channel, which will overcome the lower reliability inherent\nwith the buoy that is currently the only aid in the vicinity, and thus improve safety; and (iii) will\nenable night passage for vessels that currently use the longer route around Umboi Island during\nhours of darkness. A  minimum of 300  commercial  vessel  movements occur between Lae and\nthe North Coast of New Britain per year. Under the assumptions that (i) 90 percent of traffic now\navoids Nessup Channel adopting the longer route around Umboi Island; (ii) approximately 270\nvessel movements at an average saving of 46 nm would result from the use of Nessup Channel;\n(iii) the average service speed of commercial vessels is 10 knots; and (iv) the average economic\noperating cost of a vessel of the size and class that typically use the strait is K10,000 per day\n(K416 per hour), the total annual benefit of the route to shipowners is K0.52 million per annum.5\n\nD.\n\nHydrographic Services\n\n28.\nThe Project establishes a national hydrographic service and a PNG hydrographic office\n(PNGHO)  within  the  Department  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  (DOTCA)  and  later  with  the\nmaritime safety authority (MSA). This will enable the PNGHO to carry out a full range of marine\nsurvey,  database  management,  and  maritime  navigational  charting  functions,  and  produce\naccurate nautical charts beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001. Chart production is maintained\nat a steady rate, allowing the PNGHO to address charting priorities in PNG waters by the end of\nthe project period (2006). Apart from enhancing general maritime safety in PNG coastal waters,\nthere  are  a  number  of  areas  of  national  interest  in  which  a  strengthened  charting  capability\nwould play an important role, some carry significant economic benefits.\n\n1. \n\nMarine Boundary Delineation\n\n29.\nMost  of  the  existing  nautical  charts  of  PNG\u2019s  coastline  are  old,  inaccurate,  and\ninconsistent with GPS satellite data. In particular, the precise boundaries of PNG\u2019s 12-mile limit\nand its 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are not known. The relevant charts needed to\ndepict  these  boundaries,  produced  using  varying  methods,  are  not  consistent  with  reference\npoints.  As  a  result,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  location  of  these  boundaries  to  enable\nprosecution  of  foreign  vessels  that  may  be  infringing  PNG\u2019s  rights  in  these  waters.  With\nassistance from the Forum Fisheries Agency in Honiara, the PNG National Mapping Bureau is\nconducting  a  study  of  the  relevant  charts  to  define  areas  of  survey  needs  to  identify  the\nboundaries and reference points. A strengthened PNGHO is vital to carrying out these surveys\nand producing the updated boundary charts.\n\n2. \n\nOffshore Minerals and Petroleum Prospecting\n\n30.\nPrecise  locations  are  clearly  required  for  offshore  prospecting  activities.  Prospecting\ncompanies  carry  out  their  own  seismic  surveys,  which  produce  data  on  depths  and  seabed\ncontours,  as  well  as  on  the  underlying  rock  strata.6  A  comprehensive  set  of  accurate\nhydrographic charts would assist in the initial identification of prospecting sites, and would be of\n\n                                                       \n5\n6 Considerable quantity of seismic data collected by prospecting companies is filed by the Department of Petroleum\n\nDirect vessel operating costs = 270*(46/10) = 1,242 hours per year saved or K0.52 million per annum.\n\nand Energy. These would provide additional data input for charting work of the PNGHO.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 16, page 8\n\nsignificant benefit  in  the  resource development  stage,  when  precise  siting  of  drilling  platforms\nand  associated  equipment  over  a  relatively  large  offshore  area  is  required.  A  full-fledged\nPNGHO  would  fill  a  useful  role  in  supporting  prospecting  and  development,  and  lowering  the\nrelated  costs.  In  particular,  it  is  envisaged  that  the  PNGHO  will  perform  as  a  commercial\ncontractor  to  prospecting  companies  for  specialized  surveying  and  charting  to  support\ndevelopment  of  identified  prospects.  Such  contracting  would  provide  promising  additional\nfinancial revenues to support the PNGHO. These services are currently being contracted from\nforeign  entities.  Such  surveying  and  charting  will  be  required  to  support  major  national\ndevelopments in the future.\n\n3. \n\nFisheries\n\nThe  emerging  local  fishing  industry  is  mainly  long-liner  fishing  for  sashimi-grade  tuna\n31.\nwithin PNG\u2019s exclusive economic zone. At present, 34 locally owned long-liner boats exist, each\nwith  an  average  of  10  crew,  with  an  annual  catch  valued  at  about  $30  million.7  All  long-line\nboats carry GPS for identification and recording the precise location of fishing equipment. Most\nof  the  fisheries  are  located  within  a  few  hundred  nm  of  Port  Moresby  to  ensure  international\nairfreight connections.\n\n32.\nMost hydrographic charts used by the long-liners around Port Moresby are outdated and\nhave been corrected on an ad hoc basis by the ships\u2019 captains, using their GPS. Potential new\nfishing  grounds  exist  in  long  stretches  of  unsurveyed  waters  on  the  north  coast  of  the  PNG\nmainland.  Expanding the fishery  to  these  waters  is  constrained  by  (i)  the  lack  of  surveys  and\naccurate  charts,  and  (ii)  greater  distance  from  international  air  freight  connections.  Despite\nthese  constraints, a  small amount  of  long-line  fishing  does  occur  on  the  north  coast,  with  the\ncatches shipped by air from Lae to Port Moresby. The main difficulty is the very large areas of\nunsurveyed coastline in the potential new areas. The PNGHO would materially assist expansion\nof the long-line tuna fish industry. While long-line fishing remains constrained by air freight, new\nfishing grounds can be opened in the currently unsurveyed waters on the north coast.\n\n33.\nThe  potential  for  expanding  the  fishing  industry  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of\nhydrographic information needed for assessing the catch potential in these waters. However, a\ncertain degree of commercial potential can be assumed due to the large extent of unsurveyed\nwaters.  The  current  landing  value  of  the  catch  is  $30  million  annually.  As  a  conservative\nestimate  of  potential  benefits  from  accurate  charting  of  the  entire  unsurveyed  portions  of  the\nnorth  coast,  a  10  percent  increase  in  long-line  fishing  catch  can  be  assumed  through  greater\nexploitation of the north coast waters. The economic benefit to the country of such an expansion\nwould be in the form of greater export earnings from the sale of fish, and greater employment\ngenerated by additional boats and downstream processing activities. Under the assumption that\nthe adjusted economic value of export earnings from a 10 percent increase in long-liner activity\n(and catch) is a minimum of $1.5 million (K3.75 million) per annum and extra employment for an\nestimated 40 workers (including  downstream  workers)  is  valued  at  K400,000  per  annum,  total\nestimated economic benefits associated with the fishery expansion induced by the production of\naccurate charts is K4.2 million per annum.\n\n                                                       \n7 For 340 mariners employed at K10,000/yr, the wage bill is K3.4 million. If employment is increased by 10 percent:\n\n(3 boats) 30 crew or 300,000/yr, not including downstream employment.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 16, page 9\n\n4. \n\nMaritime Search and Rescue\n\n34.\nMaritime accidents happen regularly and frequently in PNG waters. These involve both\nlarge  commercial  ships  and  overloaded  small  craft.  The  Maritime  Search  and  Rescue\n(MARSAR) records report numerous stranded small craft that have capsized or ran out of fuel.\nMany of these accidents are resolved, but frequently the rescue efforts are severely hampered\nby inaccurate or imprecise information about accident location. This occurs usually even when\nthe distressed craft is able to report its GPS location as a consequence of inaccurate charts on\nwhich rescue authorities plot the location of the distressed vessel incorrectly. This  significantly\nlengthens  the  search  process,  delays  rescue,  and  sometimes  has  led  to  fatal  consequences.\nTable A16.3 summarizes the most serious accidents recorded in 1998 and 1999.\n\nTable A16.3: Most Serious Vessel Accidents in 1998-1999\n\nDate\n6 April 1998\n\n15 April 1998\n\n20 July 1998\n\n5 October 1998\n\n6 October 1998\n\n10 June 1999\n\n28 July 1999\n\n31 July 1999\n\n28 September 1999\n26 November 1999\n\n30 November 1999\n\nIncident\nDive boat\u2014Cape Vogel, missing\ndiver\nFishing vessel from Kiribati ran\nout of fuel; drifted to Kavieng\nMV Etotonga traveling to Kavieng,\nran aground and wrecked\nA dinghy with 15 passengers was\nstranded in bad weather near\nMadang\n19 ft dinghy with 12 passengers,\nfrom Oro Bay to Tufi\nMV Kula with 81 passengers\nenroute from Woodward to\nLosuia, capsized\nMV China Steel Trader, ran\naground, spilling oil\nFMV Nila 3, ran aground and\nwrecked\nFishing boat, lost mariner\nMV Totol, Kimbe to Lae, person\noverboard\nFV San Andres, accident on\nboard\n\nCasualties\n1 dead\n\n2 dead\n\n30 passengers rescued by\npassing ship\n7 dead\n\n1 dead, 6 missing\n\n36 dead\n\nOil spill covered Vitiaz Strait\n\nVessel sunk\n\n1 dead\n1 dead\n\n2 dead, several injured\n\nAccurate  charts  covering  at  least  the  coastal  sectors  most  frequently  used  by  small\n35.\ncraft\u2014large portions of which are currently unsurveyed\u2014would help to save lives by improving\nthe accuracy of the accident location. Fifty-one fatalities were recorded at sea during 1998 and\n1999.  For  this  analysis,  more  accurate  charts  are  assumed  to  shorten  response  time  and  be\nresponsible  for  saving  at  least  two  lives  per  year,  the  economic  value  of  this  benefit  is  K1.4\nmillion per annum.8\n\nE.\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis\n\n36.\nThe  analysis  is  summarized  in  Table  A16.4.
