THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed  \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 3 of the Stepping Up Investments \nfor Growth Acceleration Program. \n \n2.  The program supplements coordinated support provided by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to strengthen investment-led growth in Indonesia. The program promotes higher and \nbetter-quality investment through sequenced reforms that (i) provide a more predictable and open \nbusiness  environment,  (ii)  improve  the  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \ninfrastructure market, and (iii) make the public procurement system more efficient and transparent. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Subprogram 3 is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan (2018\u20132020) for Indonesia as a deliverable in 2018.1 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach and budget support. The use of a programmatic approach \nwith  a  policy-based  loan  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  aligns  ADB\u2019s  support  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform program. It also provides incentives and capacity to complete the reforms \nwith the flexibility to add new priority reforms in subsequent subprograms. In September 2014, \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the programmatic approach for subprogram 1 of the Stepping \nUp  Investments  for  Growth  Acceleration  Program,  with  the  loan  amounting  $400  million. \nSubprogram 1 comprised 21 policy actions which established a structured, long-term engagement \nto improve the investment climate, focusing on reducing foreign equity restrictions and introducing \nelectronic procurement. 2 Subprogram 2 was approved in July 2016 with a loan of $500 million, \ncomprising 18 policy actions. It focused on streamlining business licensing regulations, providing \na foundation for public-private partnerships (PPP), and implementing public procurement reforms \nfor faster and higher-quality infrastructure delivery.3 At this time, the Board also approved the \ngovernment\u2019s request for the addition of a third subprogram to maintain momentum on investment \nclimate reforms. Subprogram 3 now focuses on consolidating reforms to stimulate and facilitate \nefficient public and private investment, and to support the successful implementation of earlier \nreforms. The inclusion of a post-program partnership framework, 2018\u20132022 continues ADB\u2019s \nengagement utilizing TA and policy dialogue. \n \n4.  The development problem. Indonesia faces interrelated challenges of increasing its \neconomic growth, alleviating poverty, and reducing income inequalities. From a peak of 6.4% in \n2010, growth slowed to an average of 5.0% from 2014\u20132017. Accelerating global demand \nsuggests modest improvements in growth to 5.3% in 2018. 4 However, current projections remain \nsignificantly below the bottom of the government\u2019s target range of 7.0%\u20139.0% as stated in the \nNational  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  2015\u20132019.5 Moreover,  since  2000, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

The Gini \nindex increased from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.40 in 2015, falling slightly to 0.39 in 2017.6 Disparities have \na regional dimension. In 2016, per capita income in Jakarta was approximately $15,656, 13 times \nhigher than the average of $1,195 in East Nusa Tenggara province.7 Access to public services \nand infrastructure levels show similar disparities.8  Inequality is driven by many factors, including \nthe  following:  job  creation  is  not  sufficient  to  reduce  Indonesia\u2019s  11  million  youth  not  in \nemployment, education, or training; access to public services (e.g., health and education) is not \nequal for all; and low-income families have poor resilience to external shocks. \n \n5.  Investment constraints have contributed to low growth. A medium-term perspective \nreveals  a  5-year  average  investment growth rate of just  4.7%  since 2013.9 Until recently, \nIndonesia performed poorly in global surveys of doing business and competitiveness. The World \nBank\u2019s 2015 Doing Business report ranked Indonesia 114th out of 189 countries.10 This compared \nunfavorably with many regional peers such as Malaysia (18th), the Philippines (95th), Thailand \n(26th), and Viet Nam (78th). A cumbersome business licensing regime has contributed to this \nhigh-cost  business  environment,  which  disproportionately  affects  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs).  In  addition,  investment  remains  relatively  inefficient  and  expensive \nconsidering that every $7 spent on investment produces only $1 of income, compared with a  \n$5 investment for $1 of income in neighboring countries.11 This reflects inefficiencies in capital \nbudget execution and slow procurement. Finally, from 2008 to 2012, as a share of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), public infrastructure spending averaged only 1.5% and private infrastructure \ninvestment 0.6% compared with an average of 3.6% for both public and private across Asia.12 \nConsequently, Indonesia\u2019s stock of infrastructure in per capita terms is just one-third of the \naverage for emerging markets, or one-eighth of the average for advanced economies.13 The \ncountry\u2019s annual infrastructure investment needs are estimated at approximately 7% of GDP.14 \n \n6.  The government has begun to address investment constraints. Beginning in 2015, \nthe government gradually introduced a series of 16 economic policy packages covering a range \nof reforms, including simplified business and trade regulations, improved trade logistics, and \nreduced  barriers  to  investment.  These  packages  have  also  been  particularly  effective  in \naddressing fragmentation of responsibilities and poor coordination across government agencies \nby unifying efforts under a shared set of results, answerable to the Office of the President of \nIndonesia. The government is working to facilitate PPPs in infrastructure and has made significant \nimprovements in public procurement, with 90% of the 2017 budget spending and almost 70% of \nthe 2017 infrastructure budget delivered by November 2017. These reforms contributed to \nIndonesia\u2019s sovereign credit being elevated to an investment-grade rating by both Standard & \nPoor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings in 2017. Compared to 2015, Indonesia jumped 42 places to be ranked \n72nd out of 190 countries in the World Bank\u2019s 2018 Doing Business report (para. 5).15 The reforms \nare also beginning to show up in improved investment data. Growth in investment picked up to \n                                                \n6  The Gini index ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). A Gini index above 0.36 is comparatively \nhigh by international standards. \n7  Government of Indonesia, Statistics Indonesia. 2017. Statistics Indonesia Yearbook.

", "3 \n6.2%  in  2017,  from  4.6%  in  2016,  and  foreign  direct  investment    grew  by  8.5%  in  2017  \nyear-on-year.16 The 2018 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article IV confirms these positive \ndevelopments, noting that public investment as a share of GDP has grown by more than a full \npercentage point between 2014 and 2017, from 1.7% to 3.3%.17 However, additional reform \nefforts are needed to accelerate investment and close Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure gap. \n \n7.  Binding constraints. While subprograms 1 and 2 achieved significant progress, several \nadditional challenges must be addressed to accelerate investment, boost growth, and promote \ninclusion. These include (i) further streamlining the high-cost business environment, which deters \nprivate investment, especially for SMEs, (ii) improving access and opportunities for citizens by \nleveraging private sector participation in infrastructure investment, and (iii) accelerating delivery \nof public investments by resolving inefficiencies in the public procurement system. \n \n8.  Despite recent improvements, the regulatory environment still imposes high costs \non businesses. Costs stem from a proliferation of regulations at national and subnational levels \nas well as complex, inefficient licensing practices. The combined average number of regulations \nissued by national and subnational governments increased from 453 per year during 1999\u20132003 \nto 1,789 per year during 2010\u20132014. Starting a business in Indonesia requires an investor to \nobtain 11 approvals, and the total process takes 22 days, compared with 5 approvals and 4.5 \ndays in Thailand. Outside of Jakarta, this increases to 12 approvals and 27 days.18 Regulations \nin Indonesia are often ad hoc and are not considered under a systematic framework that identifies \nbenefits and costs. Tax administration, particularly at the subnational level, is cumbersome and \nimposes costs that disproportionally affect SMEs and constrains inclusive growth. \n \n9.  An underdeveloped framework for private participation in infrastructure hampers \nIndonesia\u2019s ability to meet investment needs. Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure gap constrains access \nto  key  public  services  like  health  and  education,  and  limits  opportunities  for  growth  and \ndevelopment for citizens with the greatest need. An uncertain regulatory framework for PPPs and \nthe  absence  of  long-term  financing  for  investment  have  limited  private  sector  interest  in \ninfrastructure. Until 2017, the government did not have a dedicated unit or project development \nfacility to help prepare and test project proposals or provide transaction advisory services. A lack \nof capacity on risk management and pricing has further biased line agencies away from PPPs. \n \n10.  Public procurement systems are not optimized to promote efficient investment and \nproject execution. Inconsistent application of procurement guidelines and outdated systems \ncreate delays in project execution. For example, up to 2017, almost 40% of procurement was \nbunched  in  the  financial  year\u2019s  fourth  quarter.19 The  absence  of  a  strong  monitoring  and \nevaluation function in the National Public Procurement Agency (LKPP) limits the provision of key \nprocurement performance metrics to different levels of management. Central agencies have little \ndata on which to gauge performance of key line agencies, and few tools to promote more \nconsistent and timely application of procurement processes. Local governments are constrained \nby the lack of efficient procurement tools and electronic systems. These constraints result in \ndelays in project execution, cost overruns, and poor value for money in public investment \nmanagement, all of which restrict the government\u2019s ability to execute pro-poor fiscal policies. \n \n                                                \n16 Government of Indonesia, Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM). 2018.

The RPJMN identifies income inequality, disparities \nin regional service delivery, and low investment as constraints to growth and development. \nTargets include annual GDP growth rates of 8%, average annual investment growth of 10.2%, \nand a reduction in the Gini index to 0.36 by 2019 (footnote 7). To meet these objectives, the \nRPJMN calls for structural reforms to stimulate investment in job-creating industries, increased \nspending  on  core  services  like  education  and  skills  development,  and  more  infrastructure \ninvestment through both public and private financing channels. These priorities are emphasized \nin the 16 economic policy packages issued by the President of Indonesia (para. 6). These \npackages seek to address coordination constraints, cut through red tape, and  significantly \nimprove specific investment climate dimensions. Highlighted initiatives include regulatory reform \nto improve the business environment and facilitate investment, resolution of land acquisition and \nregistration issues that impede timely business development, and public procurement reform to \naccelerate investment and improve the quality of infrastructure. \n \n12.  The  policy  reforms. The  program  supports  the following  reform  areas:  (i)  a more \npredictable  and  open  business  environment;  (ii)  an  improved  framework  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  infrastructure  market;  and  (iii)  more  efficient  and  transparent  public \nprocurement.  During  the  processing  of  subprogram  2  in  2016,  the  government  agreed  to \naccomplish eight expected prior actions (or triggers) and 10 policy milestones as a basis for \nsubprogram 3.20 All eight prior expected actions have been completed. One policy milestone has \nbeen upgraded into an expected prior action to reflect the government\u2019s sustained commitment \nto improving the PPP enabling environment. One new expected prior action has been added to \nreflect the government\u2019s commitment to further expedite business licensing reforms. At the \ngovernment\u2019s request, ADB refined two policy milestones to streamline the policy matrix. Of these \ntwo, one policy milestone was completed and dropped from the policy matrix and the other policy \nmilestone  was replaced  to reflect  progress  in streamlining  conditions for  local government \nborrowing to finance infrastructure investments.21 These refinements have strengthened the \noverall impact of subprogram 3, which now contains 18 reform actions (10 expected prior actions \nrepresenting high-impact reforms and eight policy milestones), all of which have been completed.  \n \n13.  More  predictable  and open  business  environment.  Building  on  accomplishments \nunder subprograms 1 and 2, this output improves Indonesia\u2019s business and investment climate \nby establishing an institutional framework for good regulatory practice and implementing the \ngovernment\u2019s red tape reduction program. Mandated by a presidential instruction, the government, \nthrough the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (KKBP), established an interministerial \ntask  force  in  2016  to  oversee  implementation  of  economic  policy  packages  and  guide \ninstitutionalization of the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) program. A new RIA unit was also \nestablished within the KKBP, and the Ministry of Trade conducted a pilot assessment of costs \nand benefits on key trade regulations. The government also continued to implement a red tape \nreduction program. Major achievements included (i) the implementation of reforms to consolidate \nbusiness  licensing  and  company  registration  into  a  single  application  process,  eliminating \nadministrative fees and the need for regular extensions, and (ii) integrating the issuance of permits \nfor construction within local one-stop service centers. Cost reductions have had a major impact \non business growth\u2014from 2015 to 2017, company registrations increased from 84,210 to 182,741, \nand business license applications grew from 89,262 to 229,902.22 Cost reductions particularly \n                                                \n20 Prior actions are considered loan disbursement conditions and policy milestones that strengthen the program.  \n21 Summary Assessment of Policy Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Trade. 2018.  ", "5 \nbenefit SMEs, which are least able to bear high cost licensing regimes. Licenses issued by one-\nstop centers grew from under 10,000 in 2015 to more than 17,000 in 2017.23  \n \n14.  The government has also mandated a new round of business regulation and licensing \nreforms to expedite investment under Presidential Decree 91/2017, which targets rationalization \nof existing regulations. The decree also introduced an online single submission (OSS) system \nwhere investors have a single-entry point for business licensing, even where multiple licenses \nacross various sectors and levels of government may be required. The OSS system features a \nnew  mobile  application  that  facilitates  communication  between  investors  and  government \ninvestment  facilitation  task  forces  and  allows  real-time  progress  monitoring  and  complaint \nresolution. Finally, the government reduced barriers to land registration and acquisition, including \nthrough the national rollout of an online land registration system to expedite registration at the \nlocal level. Under this system, registration grew from 1.1 million parcels in 2016 to 5.2 million \nparcels in 2017. These various reform efforts helped improve Indonesia\u2019s overall ranking from \n114th place in the in the World Bank\u2019s 2015 Doing Business report to 72nd in the 2018 report \n(paras. 5\u20136) (Figure 1).

Together,  reforms  have  had  a  direct  impact  on \nIndonesia\u2019s PPP pipeline. Prior to 2016, the government had limited success in implementing \nPPPs other than a small number of toll road projects. Since 2016, 14 projects have been signed, \n12 projects are currently under construction (valued at $8.5 billion), and 2 projects have reached \nfinancial close and are being prepared for implementation (valued at $1.0 billion). The government \nhas continued to expand modalities for financing the public share of capital expenditures for PPPs. \nProject-based sukuk allocations increased to Rp16.8 trillion in 2017, up from Rp13.7 trillion in \n2016,  with  two  new  projects  financed  through  the  sukuk  modality.  At  the  same  time,  the \ngovernment has improved the selection process and criteria for project-based sukuk to improve \nthe quality, selectivity, and value for money of sukuk-financed projects. These innovative reforms \nrepresent one of ADB\u2019s first engagements on Islamic finance, with useful lessons for broader \nregional work in the sector. In all, 2017 the private sector invested about Rp8.2 trillion in \ninfrastructure, up from an average of Rp4.7 trillion per year during 2012\u20132016.28 \n \n16.  More efficient and transparent public procurement. The government has built on the \ntools and systems introduced under subprogram 2 to strengthen governance, transparency, and \nperformance under subprogram 3. Key achievements include the introduction of an enhanced  \ne-procurement system that integrates the reverse auction system, reducing procurement time and \nimproving  competitiveness  amongst  bidders.  The  government  has  also  strengthened  the \nmonitoring and evaluation role of the LKPP, initiating a procurement benchmarking performance \nprocess amongst key government contracting agencies. New procurement compliance controls \nto audit procurement processes have been introduced and piloted. These initiatives provide \ncritical information to department managers, the LKPP, and the government executive, with the \ngoal of identifying and addressing systematic procurement challenges. These reforms effectively \ncomplement other ADB support on public investment, including a TA loan to improve engineering \ncapacity for project preparation.29  The government has also strengthened subnational public \nprocurement by rolling out a local electronic procurement catalog and an electronic competitive \nbidding platform for the city of Jakarta.  Because of these efforts, total public procurement \nundertaken through electronic systems increased from Rp273 trillion in 2015 to Rp344 trillion in \n2017, generating an additional Rp62 trillion of savings.30 \n \n17.  Post-program partnership framework. While nonbinding, the post-program partnership \n(P3F)  framework  provides  for  an  ongoing  dialogue  over  the  medium  term  between  the \ngovernment and ADB on investment climate reform, as well as a framework for continuing TA \nsupport. To further reduce the costs of starting a business, ADB will support broader roll-out of \nthe government\u2019s good regulatory practice program (including the use of gender-sensitive RIA) \nthrough additional capacity building, as well as implementation of the OSS window for licensing \nthrough targeted review of reform action plans. ADB will also support innovative approaches for \nmunicipal financing of investment projects, including municipal bonds and credit guarantee \nfacilities. ADB proposes to support the P3F through a regional TA project that is currently under \n                                                \n28 World  Bank.

ADB\u2019s experience. Beginning with state-owned enterprise reform in 2001, ADB has \nsupported investment climate reforms through policy dialogue, loan programs, TA, and knowledge \nproducts. The 2006 Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (footnote 29) improved \nthe quality of infrastructure and connectivity across Indonesia and provided important lessons for \nfuture infrastructure engagements. By 2014, ADB began to focus on strengthening the investment \nclimate under an integrated sector approach. In 2016, ADB supported infrastructure delivery \nthrough a TA loan of $148 million to develop capacity for engineering services (footnote 29). This \nprogram complements other ADB support in Indonesia, including programmatic support on \nfinancial  market  development  and  inclusion,  an  inclusive  energy  program  to  strengthen \ninvestment conditions and improve access to core services, and programmatic support to better \nalign  fiscal  policy  and  expenditure  management  with  sustainable  development  goals. 32 \nDetermined to further capitalize on the reform momentum, the government has requested, and \nADB is considering, a second-generation investment climate reform program covering 2020\u20132025. \n \n19.   Lessons. The program design has benefited from the following lessons. First, a focused \napproach to reform is critical where operations cover multiple sectors. Reforms should be \nprioritized considering institutional readiness at all levels. For example, institutionalization of good \nregulatory practice lacked traction in Indonesia until the Ministry of Trade demonstrated readiness \nto serve as a concrete pilot for conducting RIA. Second, the complexity and multi-sector nature \nof investment climate reforms require an executing agency with strong convening power and the \nmandate and incentive to coordinate across multiple sectors. The program\u2019s partnership with the \n                                                \n31 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance Report: Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program.

Manila. ", "8 \nKKBP has proven effective in meeting the conditions necessary for reforms to the business \nenvironment. Third, complex multi-sector reforms demand a regular review of binding constraints \nand proposed solutions. The program\u2019s initial efforts focused primarily on the central government. \nHowever, the magnitude of Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure deficiency soon revealed that the gap can \nonly be filled with the engagement of multiple partners, particularly those outside the central \ngovernment. As such, the program deliberately chose to emphasize both local government and \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure investment in subprograms 2 and 3. \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB plays a lead role \nin  supporting  investment  climate  reform  in  Indonesia.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  and \nstructured policy dialogue has helped ensure that reform measures are well coordinated and \nproperly sequenced, and that policy actions were well designed. Under this program, ADB helped \nto identify and address business climate impediments, legal and regulatory issues constraining \nPPPs, and public procurement reforms. ADB supported a more open and predictable business \nenvironment by implementing good regulatory practices, including establishing the RIA oversight \noffice at the KKBP. ADB also supported operationalization of the OSS initiative. ADB has \ncontributed to the PPP policy framework and has supported a knowledge exchange with the \nPhilippines on the treatment of unsolicited PPP proposals, where it has strong experience. ADB \nalso supported the development of new selection criteria for projects financed by sukuk. ADB \nsupported procurement benchmarking exercises for spending agencies, which improved the \nanalytical basis for LKPP\u2019s monitoring and oversight function. These measures have improved \nthe speed, efficiency, and quality of public procurement in Indonesia. \n \n21.  Development partner coordination. German development cooperation through KfW \nprovided joint collaborative financing of $245 million in for subprogram 1, $225 million for \nsubprogram 2, and an indicative \u20ac200 million for subprogram 3. ADB and KfW have carried out \njoint  program  reviews  in  Jakarta  and,  together  with  the  government,  have  formulated  \nsubprogram 3. At a technical level, ADB coordinated with KfW on improving the legal and \nregulatory conditions for local government borrowing to finance infrastructure projects. KfW \nsupported a knowledge exchange and study program that contributed to streamlined procedures \nand other regulatory reforms. ADB also partnered with the Government of Switzerland on a $5 \nmillion TA project on local tax for the Jakarta government and other municipalities.33 ADB has \ncoordinated  with  the  World  Bank  and  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment on improving regulatory practice in Indonesia. The World Bank has developed an \nRIA toolkit and worked with Indonesia\u2019s National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) on \nits review of existing regulations, complementing ADB\u2019s capacity building efforts with the KKBP \nand  other  partners.  ADB  also  coordinated  with  the  Australian\u2013Indonesian  Partnership  for \nEconomic Growth to develop the OSS system for business licensing and the communications \nprotocols  to  manage  investor\u2013taskforce  interactions.  ADB  coordinated  with  the  IMF  on \nIndonesia\u2019s structural reform program and macro-fiscal framework. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n22.  Economic impact of the program. Strong investment is a key component of inclusive \ngrowth and helps countries overcome middle income constraints.34 The program is achieving \nresults: under subprogram 1, trade liberalization efforts reduced the amount of closed and \n                                                \n33 ADB. 2015.

", "9 \nrestricted industries from 276 to 220, and under subprogram 2, about 150 business and trade \nregulations were simplified or eliminated, and licensing authority was delegated from 22 agencies \nto  one-stop service  centers. These  efforts  contributed  to  an  increase  in  net foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows from 1.3% of GDP in 2013 to 1.7% in 2014 and 2016, and 2.0% in 2017 \n(footnote 18). Subprogram 3 continues with positive economy-wide effects. The program impact \nassessment estimates the potential net quantifiable benefits of the program at $8.7 billion under \nconservative discounting assumptions. Of this total, about $4.7 billion accrues from the impact of \nincreased trade and foreign investment inflows caused by strengthening the business climate, \nimproving the regulatory framework, and facilitating the ease of starting a business at the central \nand local levels. An additional $1.8 billion will be derived from improvements to the framework for \nPPP projects and streamlined land acquisition and local borrowing procedures. Improvements in \npublic procurement are also expected to have a net present benefit of $2.3 billion. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n23.  The government requested a single tranche loan of $500 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 3.35 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The average loan maturity is  \n9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. German development cooperation \nthrough KfW is providing collaborative financing for subprogram 3 (para. 21). The government\u2019s \ngross financing need in 2018 is $58.4 billion, with a budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP. To finance the \ndeficit, the government plans to raise $43.8 billion from the issuance of securities and $3.8 billion \nfrom official foreign loans. The size of subprogram 3 primarily reflects the government\u2019s financing \nneeds, the strength of the reform program, and the net economic benefits (para. 22). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The KKBP, the executing agency, will be responsible for coordinating the government\u2019s \neconomic reform packages. The Ministry of Finance, Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board \n(BKPM), Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning, PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (a state-owned \ninfrastructure  financing  company),  and  LKPP  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nimplementation of program policy actions will be monitored through a steering committee chaired \nby a deputy minister of the executing agency and consisting of senior representatives from the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  implementation  period  is  from  July  2016  to  June  2018  for \nsubprogram 3. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  Safeguards. The subprogram does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n26.  Poverty and social. The reforms supported under the program target sustainable and \ninclusive growth and will contribute to a reduction in income inequality and poverty reduction. \nInfrastructure investment helps connect the poor and marginalized with critical public services. A \nstronger investment climate helps support the growth of job-creating industries. Improvements in \n                                                \n35 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. ", "10 \nthe regulatory framework reduce the costs of starting a business, especially for SMEs. Given the \nmacro nature of the program\u2019s reforms, no gender benefits are directly observed.36 \n \n27.  Governance. Public financial management continues to improve. The recent introduction \nof new tools, such as the KRISNA integrated budget and planning system, have aligned planning \nand budget processes under a consolidated performance framework. 37 This has improved the \npolicy basis of budget planning and tracking. Efforts to improve financial controls have increased \nsignificantly, with more than 70% of government agencies receiving an unqualified audit opinion \nfrom the external audit agency in 2017, up from just 40% in 2009. The move toward electronic \ndelivery of licensing, procurement, and other government services increases automation and \nreduces further opportunities for human interference and leakages. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and KKBP. \n \n28.  Risks and Mitigating Measures. The program has one substantial risk.38 Effective \ncoordination  on  structural  reforms  is  necessary  for  successful  implementation.  To  date, \ncoordination risks have been mitigated by the strong role of the President\u2019s office through the \neconomic policy packages. However, there is a risk that new packages will become less strategic \nand will be politicized, especially in the context of the upcoming general elections in April 2019. \nTo  mitigate  this  risk,  ADB  is  working  with  the  KKBP  to  strengthen  their  role  to  lead  the \nimplementation of policy packages, and to facilitate and coordinate good regulatory reform \nthrough their role in steering institutionalization of RIA. Additionally, ADB is providing capacity \nbuilding to the KKBP to institutionalize the RIA process. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n29.  The government and KKBP have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Stepping  Up \nInvestments for Growth Acceleration Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular \nterms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n18 May 2018\n                                                \n36 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 This is a specialized budget module linked to the national integrated financial management system that was used by \nall line agencies for the preparation of the 2018 budget. \n38 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
