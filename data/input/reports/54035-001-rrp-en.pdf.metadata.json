of \nup  to  $65,500,000  in Indian  rupee  equivalent to  Electro  Solaire  Private Limited (ESPL) for the \nGujarat Solar Power Project in India. \n \n2. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other lenders propose to provide senior secured \nloans  of  $109.1  million  to  ESPL  to  construct  a  200-megawatt  (MW)  solar  photovoltaic-based \npower plant located in the state of Gujarat in India. The project will further diversify the energy \nmix of India in favor of renewable energy and help the Government of India meet its targets for \nnon-fossil-fuel-based electric power generation, leading to a reduction in the intensity of India\u2019s \ncarbon emissions. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. In May 2019, ESPL won a bid to develop 200 MW of photovoltaic \nsolar capacity on a build\u2013own\u2013operate basis under Phase III of Raghanesda Solar Park (700 MW \ncapacity) through competitive bidding conducted by state-owned electricity distribution company \nGujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL). ESPL is a special purpose vehicle incorporated on \n13 October 2015 to implement the project and is 100% owned by ENGIE Solar SAS (ESS), an \nentity incorporated and based in France, which holds the solar assets of the ENGIE group. ESPL \nhas  approached  ADB  to  arrange  a  senior  secured  loan  of  up  to  $109.1  million  to  fund  the \nconstruction of the project. ADB is providing up to $65.5 million and is facilitating cofinancing of \nup to $43.6 million from commercial lenders as a parallel loan. \n \nThe  project  provides  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  scale  up  its  clean-energy  financing.1 \n4. \nADB\u2019s initiative will actively support the government\u2019s target to achieve 175 gigawatts (GW) of \nrenewable  energy  generation  capacity  by  2022,  including  100  GW  from  solar  power.  As  of \nDecember 2019, operational solar generation capacity in India was about 33.7 GW (85.9 GW total \nrenewable  energy  capacity).2 The  government  expects  the  private  sector  to  lead  the  capacity \naddition. The unique reverse auction structure leading to discovery of the lowest tariff, favorable \nmovement in solar panel prices, creation of credible offtake intermediaries, and setting up of mega \nsolar parks and other enabling infrastructure have resulted in solar power tariffs declining to about \n\u20b92.7 ($0.04) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) from about \u20b95.2/kWh in fiscal year 2015, leading to improved \naffordability of solar power in India. \n \n5. \nProject design. ESPL signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with GUVNL \non 26 August 2019 at a tariff of \u20b92.65/kWh. The project has to achieve financial closure within 9 \nmonths of the date of execution of the PPA, with commissioning to occur within 15 months of the \nsame date (by 25 November 2020, the scheduled commissioning date or SCD). In case of a delay \nin commissioning of certain capacity beyond SCD but up to 6 months from SCD, GUVNL may \ndraw on ESPL\u2019s performance bank guarantee (PBG) calculated at \u20b913,111 per MW per day for \nsuch  capacity.  The  total  PBG  will  be  capped  at  \u20b9472  million  ($6.6  million).  Also,  for  capacity \ndelayed for more than 6 months beyond scheduled commissioning date, the tariff will be reduced \nby \u20b90.0050/kWh per day.  \n \n\n \n1  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n2  Government of India. Ministry of Power. Central Electricity Authority. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nThe project cost estimates include proposed 20% basic customs duty (BCD) on imported \n6. \nsolar modules, which is about 10% of project cost. The BCD was announced by the government \non 1 February 2020 to provide impetus to domestic manufacturers, however, the effective date \nhad not been declared as of end-February 2020. \n \n7. \nAs per the PPA, the contracted capacity utilization factor (CUF) for the project is 27.72%. \nGUVNL  is  required  to  grant  must-run  status  to  the  project.  For  any  grid  backdown  due  to  low \ndemand,  ESPL  will  be  compensated  at  50%  of  average  generation  during  the  month.  For \ncurtailment due to grid unavailability, ESPL will not be compensated. \n \n8. \nThe project is located in Raghanesda Solar Park in Gujarat, which is being developed by \nGujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL). ESPL signed an Implementation Support Agreement \nwith GPCL on 22 October 2019 to grant ESPL access to the common solar park infrastructure. \nGPCL has also provided ESPL with possession of 100% of the land that it requires for the project \n(939 acres). ESPL will sign the land lease agreement prior to financial closure. In addition, GPCL \nwill build the solar park\u2019s infrastructure and will charge annual operation and maintenance (O&M) \nfees to maintain this infrastructure.  \n \n9. \nGPCL  will  also  provide  all  power  evacuation  facilities.  The  project  will  connect  to  the \ninternal  substation  at  its  own  cost  through  an  underground  cable  for  which  GPCL  will  provide \nright-of-way. GPCL is constructing a 35-kilometer transmission line that will connect the internal \nsubstation to the grid substation at Khimanawas being constructed by Power Grid Corporation of \nIndia  Limited.  The  project  will  be  considered  to  have  been  commissioned  on  the  date  it  starts \nevacuating power into the grid substation. As confirmed by the lender\u2019s technical advisor (LTA), \nthe grid substation is ready for commissioning, and construction of transmission lines is already \nunderway. Of the 110 towers to be installed, piling work has been completed for 51 towers, 35 of \nwhich have been erected. It is expected that the solar park will be commissioned by September \n2020. As per the LTA, the project is expected to commission on schedule. \n \n10. \nGUVNL is the offtaker for the project. It is 100% owned by the state of Gujarat and is the \nholding company for the entities engaged in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution \nservices  in  Gujarat.  GUVNL  is  consistently  regarded  as  the  best  state  distribution  company  in \nIndia and has robust financials. It has a track record of making timely payments, including for two  \nADB projects for which GUVNL was the PPA counterparty: the 145 MW Grid Connected Solar \nProject  and  the  Solar  and  Wind  Power  Development  Project.3 ICRA  Limited,  an  independent \nrating agency based in India and a subsidiary of Moody\u2019s, has rated GUVNL domestic AA- (stable) \nas of March 2019. GUVNL reported revenues of $7.0 billion and a net profit of $140.0 million in \nFY2019. As of 31 March 2019, it had total assets of $11.4 billion and its net worth was $3.8 billion. \n \n11. \n \n12. \nBorrower  and  sponsor.  ESPL  is  the  special  purpose  vehicle  set  up  to  implement  the \nproject. It is 100% owned by ESS, which has more than 3 GW of solar assets, either operational \nor under construction, spread across France (about 1.3 GW), India (about 800 MW), Mexico (772 \nMW), and Brazil (296 MW). ESS is ultimately held by ENGIE SA, a French energy conglomerate \nwith operations in more than 70 countries. In addition to 800 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity in \nIndia,  the  ENGIE  group  has  another  480  MW  of  wind  projects,  either  operational  or  under \nconstruction in India. Its other significant business interests include Tractebel India, a well-known \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n3  ADB. \n\nIndia:  145  Megawatts  Grid-Connected  Solar  Project.  and  ADB. \n\nIndia:  Solar  and  Wind  Power \n\nDevelopment Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nengineering services provider, and Cofely Axima India, which specializes in climate engineering. \nAs of December 2019, ENGIE SA had 96.8 GW of installed power capacity, of which renewable \nenergy accounted for 28%. Its market capitalization was $44 billion as of 4 March 2020. \n \nESS owns and operates 619 MW of solar photovoltaic assets in India through Solairedirect \n13. \nEnergy India Private Limited (SEIPL), a 100% owned subsidiary. About 84% of SEIPL\u2019s portfolio \nhas been contracted with central government offtakers: Solar Energy Corporation of India (rated \ndomestic AA+ by ICRA Limited) and NTPC Limited (rated domestic AAA by ICRA Limited). The \nportfolio has performed robustly, with actual generation typically above P90 estimates. Average \naccounts  receivables  for  SEIPL\u2019s  projects  range  between  0  month  and  3  months,  except  for \nprojects  in  Telangana,  where  outstanding  receivables  stand  at  about  10  months.  Historically, \nSEIPL  has  supported  its  projects  to  meet  debt  obligations  through  additional  capital  infusions \nwhen required. In January 2020, as part of an asset monetizing strategy, SEIPL entered into a \nbinding agreement with Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus Fund to sell a 74% shareholding in \neach of its 12 projects. Once the sale is completed, SEIPL will use sale proceeds to develop new \nassets in India and repay loans from ESS. \n \n14. \nsupport to ESPL.

Its operational capacity increased from 154 MW on 31 March 2017 to 369 MW on \n31  March  2019  and  to  619  MW  on  28  February  2020.  Its  cash  flow  from  operations  declined \nsignificantly in FY2019 because of an increase in receivables at its 50 MW project in Telangana\u2014\nwhich  was  addressed  through  a  fresh  capital  infusion  (Table  1).

ADB\u2019s \nreview of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering \nor terrorism financing. No tax integrity due diligence was required. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nImpact. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) renewable energy generation \ncapacity  of  175  GW  achieved  by  2022,5 and  (ii)  share  of  non-fossil-fuel-based  electric  power \ngeneration capacity increased to 40% by 2030.6       \n \n18. \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: renewable power delivered to the \ndomestic grid increased.7 It will generate about 439 gigawatt-hours of clean energy per annum \nand help avoid the emission of 385,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually from 2022.

The outputs will be (i) solar power generation capacity increased by 200 MW, \n19. \n(ii) local employment generated, (iii) growth of local economy supported, and (iv) strengthening \nof human resources policy and practices to make it more gender-responsive. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is fully aligned with \nADB's Energy Policy, which prioritizes support for renewable energy development (footnote 1). \nThe project is consistent with the following operational priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability.8 It contributes to ADB\u2019s goal to provide climate finance of $80 billion cumulatively \nfrom 2019 to 2030. Total climate mitigation finance is estimated to cost $65.5 million, 100% of \nADB\u2019s own investments. No adaptation finance has been estimated for this project. It relates to \ntwo of the five core specializations of ADB: infrastructure and environment. The project will also \ncontribute to ADB\u2019s operational goal of scaling up private sector development and private sector \noperations,  including  supporting  private  sector  operations\u2019  long-term  cofinancing  target  where \nevery $1 in financing is to be matched by $2.50 of long-term cofinancing as per ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 (footnote 8). The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u2013\n2022,  which  calls  for  higher  efficiency  and  carbon  mitigation  through  power  generation  from \nrenewable sources.9 \n \n21. \nLessons from previous operations. Extended annual reviews of previous ADB wind and \nsolar projects in India financed by Nonsovereign Operations highlighted three key lessons: (i) the \nimportance of energy assessment, (ii) the risks associated with land acquisition, and (iii) the need \nfor adequate power evacuation facilities. The project\u2019s implementation arrangements incorporate \nthese lessons and ADB, as a key senior lender, will closely monitor these aspects. \n \nD. \n \n22. \n \n23. \n \nE. \n \n24. \n \nF. \n \n25. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n8  ADB.  2018.

The loan will have a tenor of 20 years with \n26. \na  fixed  repayment  schedule.  ESPL  will  be  bound  by  commercial  terms,  and  financial  and \noperational covenants stipulated in the financing agreements. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s assistance is critical as it will provide long-term financing, which continues to be \nchallenging  for  the  renewable  energy  sector  in  India.  Even  prior  to  COVID-19,  local  financial \ninstitutions having largely reached their exposure limits for the energy sector along with tightening \nliquidity in the domestic financial market had led to a renewed and prominent role for ADB support \nto overcome gaps in the availability of long-term finance. ADB\u2019s role is now expected to be even \nmore relevant in light of the expected significant disruptions in the commercial debt market due \nto COVID-19. As per the financing agreements, the project will be obligated to implement ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  thereby  adopting  internationally  recognized  environmental \nand social standards. ADB\u2019s involvement will also ensure that the project promotes gender equity. \nADB is also facilitating cofinancing through a parallel loan. \n \nC. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n31. \n \n32. \n \n33. \n \n34. \n \n35. \n \n36. \n \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n37. \nADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C),  and  indigenous \npeoples (category C). 10  \n \n\n10 ADB.

The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  ESPL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate.  \n\n39. \nEnvironment.  An  independent  consultant  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  report.  The  potential  environmental  impacts\u2014noise,  vibration,  dust,  waste \ngeneration, ground contamination, and soil erosion\u2014are generally associated with construction \nactivities.  These  impacts  are  generally  site-specific  and  short-term  and  can  be  effectively \nmanaged by implementing good engineering, construction, and project management practices as \nwell  as  preventive  and  control  measures  reflected  in  the  World  Bank  Group\u2019s  Environmental, \nHealth,  and  Safety  General  Guidelines,  as  detailed  in  the  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans. Potential climate-change induced impacts have also been assessed within \nthe initial environmental examination report. Occupational health and safety risks will be mitigated \nthrough the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, monitoring, \nand the provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational health and \nsafety  provisions,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements,  will  be \nincorporated into the contractor agreements. \n \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  in  a  solar  park  and  covers  about  939  acres.  The \n40. \nenvironmental and social assessment and ADB\u2019s due diligence found no legacy issues around \nthe  transfer  of  government  land  to  the  project.  The  land  is  saline,  sandy  (mostly  deprived  of \nvegetation), uncultivable, and not fit for agricultural usage. No private land has been acquired or \nleased for the project and no physical or economic displacement is envisaged. The transmission \nline linking the project to the grid substation is a shared facility being built by GPCL (and will also \nbe operated by it) for the entire solar park. The project is not located in an area inhabited or used \nby distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples or ethnic minority groups. No impact on indigenous \npeoples is envisaged. \n \n41. \nSome  gender  elements.  ESPL  commits  to  implement  measures  to  promote  gender \nequality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand  Development  (1998).
