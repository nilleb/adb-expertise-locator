Health \nsystems  will  be  strengthened  in  6  of  the  13  oblasts\u2014  the  oblasts  of \nBuhkara,  Fergana  (as  the  pilot  site),  Kashkadarya,  Khorezm,  and \nTashkent, and the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The selection of these \noblasts was based on poverty and poor health outcome criteria. The \nWCHDP  will  cover  36%  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  43%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  poor,  and  53%  of  the  country\u2019s  extremely  poor.  The  blood \nsafety  program  and  institutional  capacity  building  for  nurses  and \nmidwives  will  be  implemented  nationwide,  and  policy  initiatives  and \nstrategies will be strengthened at the national and local levels. \n \nThe  WCHDP  will  support  health  sector  reform  and  strengthen \nservices  that  have  (i)  positive  externalities,  as  it  focuses  on  primary \nhealth care; and (ii) merit goods, as it will directly impact woman and \nchild health, reduce unnecessary use of hospitals, and provide better \ninformation to consumers. \n \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  WCHDP  is  to  help  the  Government  achieve \nhealth  related  millennium  development  goals  by  reducing  maternal \nand  child  mortality  and  morbidity,  reducing  infectious  diseases,  and \nfocusing  on  the  rural  poor  and  vulnerable  populations.  To  achieve \nthis,  the  WCHDP  has  two  broad  objectives:  (i)  support  health  sector \nreform  initiatives  for  primary  health  care,  and  (ii)  improve  the \nefficiency of the health care delivery system for WCH. \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n \n\nEnvironmental  \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n \n\nRationale \n\nObjectives \n\n \n\n\fiii \niv \n\n \n\nThe  WCHDP  was  prepared  in  parallel  with  the World  Bank  Health-II \nproject; the projects have complementary components. The WCHDP \ncomprises  four  components:  (i)  strengthening  WCH  services;  (ii) \nstrengthening  finance,  information,  and  management;  (iii)  building  a \nblood  safety  program;  and  (iv)  improving  project  management. \nComponent 1 will build the primary care and first referral network for \nWCH, with improved quality of services and capacity of medical and \nparamedical personnel to offer international standards of health care. \nComponent  2  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  health  system  by \nimproving payment mechanisms, management, and access to timely \ninformation.  Component  3  will  reduce  the  spread  of  blood-borne \ninfectious  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  by  building  a  nationwide \nblood  safety  program.  Component  4  will  strengthen  MOH\u2019s  capacity \nfor project management, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nThe  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide a $40.0 million loan to finance the WCHDP. The Government \nwill provide $30.0 million as counterpart funds for the ADB loan.  \n \nOf  the  estimated  WCHDP  cost  of  $70.0  million  equivalent,  foreign \nexchange cost will be $35.8 million (51%) and local currency cost will \nbe  $34.1  million  (49%).  The  ADB  loan  of  $40.0  million  represents \n57%  of  the  total  WCHDP  costs.  The  Government\u2019s  share  is  $30.0 \nmillion  equivalent,  or  43%  of  total  WCHDP  costs.  ADB  will  fund  the \nentire foreign exchange cost, and 12% of the local currency cost. \n \n\n($ million equivalent)\n\nPercent \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development \nBank \nGovernment share  \nTotal  \n\nForeign \nExchange \n35.85 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n4.15 \n\n0.00 \n35.85 \n\n30.00 \n34.15 \n\nTotal \nCost \n40.00 \n\n30.00 \n70.00 \n\n57 \n\n43 \n100 \n\n \nParallel to the WCHDP, the World Bank will provide $40.0 million for \nthe  Health-II  Project,  with  Government  counterpart  funds  of  $78.1 \nmillion. In addition, the Government of Japan will provide $6.0 million \nfor  two  health  projects,  through  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency grant financing. \n\nA loan of $40.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum, conversion options that may be exercised in accordance \nwith  the  terms  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are set forth in the loan agreement. ADB will be entitled \nto withdraw from the loan account and pay to itself, on behalf of the \nborrower, the amounts required to meet payments, when due, of such \ninterest and commitment charges during project implementation.  \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n   \n\n \n\n\f \n\niv\n\n \nUntil 30 June 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services  MOH, \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nMinistry of Health (MOH) \n \nMOH  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  The  WCHDP  will  be \nimplemented  in  parallel  with  World Bank  Health-II  Project, under  the \noverall guidance of a project inter-agency steering committee, headed \nby  a  deputy  prime  minister.  A  joint  project  implementation  bureau \n(JPIB)  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation,  and  will  be \nsupported \nfor  day-to-day  administration  by  oblast-level  project \nimplementation offices.  \n \nMOH,  through  JPIB,  will  procure  goods  and  services.  Equipment \n(medical and non-medical), vehicles, and supplies will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding, \nlocal \ncompetitive bidding, or direct purchase. Civil works will be funded and \ncontracted by the local governments. \n \n\ninternational  shopping, \n\nthrough  consulting \n\nthrough  JPIB,  will  engage \n\ninternational  and  domestic \nconsultants individually, except for systems development and studies, \nwhere  consultants  will  be  recruited \nfirms. \nRecruitment of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for domestic \nconsultants.  ADB\u2019s  quality-and-cost-based  selection  method  will \napply for consulting firms. \n \nThe  WCHDP  will  support  health  sector  reform,  and  help  achieve \nefficiency  gains.  The  WCHDP  will  help  expand  financial  reforms  to \nrural clinics and will introduce incentives for hospitals to become more \nefficient.  Investments  are  designed  to  shift  some  resources  from \nhospitals in urban settings to rural clinics serving less accessible and \nless  prosperous  communities.  In  addition,  the  management  capacity \nof local governments, hospitals, and rural clinics will be strengthened, \nincluding the health management information systems. The WCHDP \nwill  improve  the  health  status  of  women  and  children,  reduce \nmaternal  and  infant  mortality  and  morbidity,  and  reduce  infectious \ndiseases, resulting in significant economic returns in terms of years of \nhealthy life gained. Blood safety programs supported by the WCHDP \nwill help reduce infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and provide \nsafe blood nationwide.  \n \nThe  WCHDP  will  focus  on  (i)  primary  health  care,  which  provides \nmore  than  proportionate  benefits  to  the  poor;  (ii)  health  facilities  in \nrural  areas,  where  most  poor  citizens  reside;  (iii)  WCH  issues  that \nimpact  disproportionately  on  the  rural  poor;  and  (iv)  relatively  poorer \nregions of the country. \n\n \n\n\fvi v \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \nIn  addition  to  the  emphasis  on  health  care  for  women  and  children, \nthe WCHDP has built in its components, institutional strengthening for \nretraining  of  health  personnel,  and  especially  to  improve  the  status \nand profile of nurses and midwives, who are primarily female. \n \nPrimary  concerns  are  (i)  the  ability  of  the  Government  to  finance \nrenovation  and  building  costs,  especially  in  the  relatively  poorer \nregions,  and  (ii)  the  increased  burden  on  local  governments  of \nnonsalary  recurrent  costs,  as  many  health  facilities  are  currently \nunderfunded.  Delays  by  the  Government  in  implementing  needed \npolicy  changes  could  delay  or  restrain  the  implementation  of  some \nproject components. \n \nTechnical  assistance  on  Capacity  Building  for  Woman  and  Child \nHealth  Development  of  $300,000  will  be  provided  to  (i)  strengthen \nits \nMOH\u2019s  capacity \nunderstanding  of  provider  and  consumer  behaviors,  and  the  causes \nof  morbidity  and  mortality;  (ii)  help  the  Government  optimize  and \nrationalize  services \nincluding  human  resource \nplanning; and (iii) increase the effectiveness and delivery of services \nthrough  quality  monitoring  and \ntechnical \nassistance  will  complement  the  WCHDP  by  strengthening  MOH\u2019s \ncapacity to make WCH care more efficient, effective, and sustainable. \n \n\nto  deal  with  health \n\nimprovements.

However, the situation has changed since then\u2014a result \nof  stagnating  and  in  some  cases  deteriorating  health  indicators.  The  maternal  mortality  ratio \n(MMR),  officially  estimated  at  34  per  100,000  live  births  in  2001,2  has  not  improved  since  the \nmid-1990s, with wide geographical disparities. The infant mortality rate (IMR) at 62 deaths per \n1,000  live  births  in  20023  has  changed  little  since  the  early  1990s;  rural  areas  report  almost \ndouble the rate of urban areas. Most infant deaths are in the first month of life, even though the \nmajority  of  births  take  place  in  hospitals  and  immunization  coverage  is  high.  The  incidence  of \ncommunicable diseases is increasing; HIV/AIDS4 registered cases have almost doubled in the \npast  2  years,  and  tuberculosis  incidence  has  doubled  over  the  past  decade.  If  this  trend \ncontinues, then Uzbekistan will be unable to achieve the health related millennium development \ngoals (MDGs), the trend of which is in Table 1.5 A health sector analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Uzbekistan: Relevant Health-Related Millennium Development Goals \nGoal \n2015 \n\n1993\u20131997 \n\n1988\u20131992 \n\n1998\u20132002 \n\nBaseline \n\n \n \n \nRelevant Goal for Health \nMaternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births) \nChild Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births)  \nInfant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births)  \nHIV/AIDS Prevalence (% 15\u201349 years) \n\n65 \n63 \n52 \n\u2014 \n\n35 \n\u2014 \n64 \n\u2014 \n\n34 \n73 \n62 \n<0.01 \n\n16 \n21 \n17 \n<0.01 \n\nNote:  \u2014=  not  available;  HIV/AIDS  =  Human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome;  Date  is \nindicated for approximate calendar period.                           \nSource:  Government  of  Uzbekistan.  1997.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  Preparing  the  Woman  and  Child  Health \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n\n2   Government  of  Uzbekistan.  Includes  mostly  registered  deaths,  rather  than  information  from  maternal  mortality  or \npregnancy outcome household surveys. The Government of Uzbekistan reports the MMR declined from 65 in 1991 \nto 21 in 1996, and rose to 34 in 2001. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund model estimates adjusted MMR to be 60 \nfor 1995. \n\n3  Government of Uzbekistan. 2004. Uzbekistan Health Examination Survey. Tashkent. The IMR reported by MOH is \nmuch lower, and is based on a definition of live births developed during the Soviet era. According to that definition, \na pregnancy that ends at less than 28 weeks gestation is considered premature if it does not survive 7 days and is \nclassified as a late miscarriage. The Government of Uzbekistan reported the IMR as 19 per 1,000 live births from \n1998\u20132002, based on registered events. \n\n4   HIV/AIDS is Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n5  The MDGs for health to be achieved between 1990 and 2015: MMR to be reduced by 3/4, infant and child mortality \nrate to be reduced by 2/3, births attended by skilled professionals to increase, and child malnutrition to be halved. \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nMany official health outcome statistics reported for the country may be inconsistent with \n3. \nthose  obtained  through  household  surveys.  Overall,  Uzbekistan  reports  good  health  care \ncoverage but quality is still lacking: about 95% of women receive antenatal care, but only 39% \nof these receive antenatal care within the first trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, 98% of women \ndeliver their babies at health facilities under the guidance of a skilled health attendant, but the \nprimary  cause  of  maternal  mortality  is  from  pregnancy  or  delivery  complications,  mainly \nhemorrhage  and  hypertensive  disorders.  This  evidence  suggests  that  prenatal  care  is  poor, \ndespite high attendance, and that high-risk cases are poorly managed.  \n  \n4. \nKey Issues. Causes of poor health outcomes include (i) outdated policy, protocols, and \nprocedures;  (ii)  poor  integration  of  the  health  delivery  system,  including  primary  health  care \n(PHC) (the Soviet era emphasized vertical and hospital-based health care); (iii) lack of strategic \nneeds-based  human  resource  planning,  and  of  continuing  education  for  medical  and \nparamedical  staff  (the  Soviet  era  medical  system  encouraged  specialized  medical  personnel \nover  generalists,  and  institutionalized  continuing  education  programs  were  absent);  (iv) \ninequitable budgetary support and inappropriate payment systems (in Soviet times, health care \nresources were allocated through general revenues, but since independence, the resource base \nhas declined drastically, and oblasts and rayons are expected to cover recurrent costs, with no \nchange in budgeting systems [they are currently input based], leading to significant inequities); \nand (v) weak initiatives for dissemination of knowledge and behavioral change (health education \nwas  not  traditionally  part  of  the  Soviet  health  system,  where  health  providers  did  not  inform \npatients of their health condition or services offered).  \n \n5. \nHealth Sector Policy Reform. The Government has embarked on several health-sector \nreform  initiatives,  since  the  mid-1990s.  In  1996,  a  Presidential  Decree  (UP-2107),  improving \nPHC for the rural population was introduced. In 1988, a comprehensive reform agenda, which \nintroduced  emergency  hospitals  and  initiatives  on  the  public-private  mix  for  secondary  health \nservices,  was  adopted  to  improve  equity  in  access  to  quality  and  affordable  health  care. \nThrough  these  initiatives,  several  efficiency  gains  were  achieved,  including  closing  hospital \nbeds, reducing hospital admissions, and improving outpatient care. A series of long-term state \nprograms for woman and child health (WCH), including the integrated management of childhood \nillnesses,  the  safe  motherhood  initiative,  promotion  of  breastfeeding,  micronutrient  deficiency \ncontrol  (primarily  iron  and  iodine),  and  family  planning  were  endorsed  in  2002.  These  were \nimportant steps to improve WCH. However, many programs were limited in terms of geographic \ncoverage,  and  budget;  they  lacked  integration  and  were  supported  solely  by  international \nagencies.  Overall,  the  country  is  making  progress  in  improving  health  care  for  the  population, \nbut considerable effort is required to accelerate reforms.  \n \n6. \nAid  Harmonization.  The  World  Bank,  active  in  the  health  sector  in  the  country  since \n1998,  has  been  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  PHC  initiative  in  selected  oblasts  under  the \nHealth-I  Project  implemented  between  1998  and  2004.  Under  the  Health-II  project,  the  World \nBank plans to extend its support for the PHC initiative to the rest of the country, and support the \nGovernment\u2019s health sector reforms related to PHC. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe  World  Bank  agreed  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  to  develop  parallel  and \ncomplementary  projects.  Both  projects  will  concentrate  on  the  primary  level.  In  addition,  the \nWCHDP  will  address  gaps  in  WCH  care  by  focusing  on  policy  reform,  providing  an  essential \nhealth care package, streamlining and integrating the health system, strengthening the capacity \nof  institutions  to  deliver  efficiently,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  health  care  providers  to \nprovide quality and cost-effective interventions for WCH services. \n \n\n \n\n\f  3\n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nWoman and Child Health Care Initiatives. WCH services are currently fragmented and \nparticularly limited at the Selski Vrachebny Punkt  (SVP or Russian terminology for rural medical \ncenter)  level.  Little  rationalization  has  taken  place  in  PHC  beyond  the  first  level  of  outpatient \ncare. SVPs are the first clinics providing PHC services. For women, although pre- and postnatal \ncare  as  well  as  counseling  is  provided  at  SVPs  and  policlinics,  obstetrical  care  takes  place  at \nhospitals.  The  central  rayon  hospitals  (CRHs)  provide  obstetrical  care  and  first  level  referral \ncare,  although  no  referral  links  are  created  from  SVPs.  Delivery  hospitals  offer  services  for \nnormal deliveries, but have little scope for care of complicated deliveries and high-risk neonates, \nand  limited  exposure  to  safe  motherhood  and  baby  friendly  hospital  initiatives.  In  addition, \nstandards, guidelines, and protocols of service delivery are outdated. The oblast or next referral \nhospitals  accommodate  delivery  complications,  although  referral  protocols  remain weak.  WCH \ncare rationalization and a service integration plan are needed within a health system framework. \nWCH receives little external support, and the Government has requested the assistance of the \nWCHDP in this area. \n \n8. \nPrimary  Health  Care  Initiatives.  Uzbekistan  inherited  a  comprehensive  network  of \nhealth  care  facilities,  with  an  eight-tiered  health  delivery  system  that  overemphasized  vertical, \nhospital-based health care, and gave little priority to PHC. Under the 1996 presidential decree, \nthe  Government  supported  PHC  initiatives  and  created  a  nationwide  system,  where  the  lower \nlevel  health  clinics  were  merged  to  form  SVPs,  staffed  with  general  medical  practitioners  and \nnurses,  and  equipped  for  preventive  and  basic  health  care  services.  Health-I  strengthened \nservices  for  the  SVPs  in  three  oblasts,  and  later  this  was  extended  to  two  additional  oblasts. \nThere is a need for the SVP services to be strengthened nationwide.  \n \n9. \nHIV/AIDS  Initiatives.  A  comprehensive  blood  safety  program  does  not  exist.  The \ncountry  lacks  a  defined  national  blood  safety  policy,  strategic  planning,  and  appropriate \nlegislation  and  regulations.  It  also  does  not  have  a  national  quality  management  system  or \nstandards of practice for the blood supply chain. Only about 60% of blood is said to be screened \nfor  blood-borne  infectious  disease  before  transfusion,  leading  to  risk  of  transmission  of \ninfectious  disease  such  as  HIV/AIDS.  Many  blood  donors  are  still  subject  to  old  standards, \nguidelines,  and  protocols,  which  do  not  follow  evidence-based  medicine.  Given  Uzbekistan\u2019s \nwidely  dispersed  population,  and  the  fact  that  the  foremost  cause  of  maternal  deaths  is \npostpartum  bleeding,  having  an  adequate  and  readily  accessible  blood  supply  at  the  point  of \nneed  is  a  top  priority.  The  current  blood  transfusion  supply  system  is  too  elaborate;  is  under-\nfunded;  and  lacks  quality  standards,  training,  and  supplies.  In  addition,  the  country  lacks  a \nreliable  and  healthy  blood  donor  base  and  registry.  The  Government  has  requested  the \nassistance of the WCHDP to establish a blood safety program in the country. \n \nHuman  Resource  Development  Initiatives.  Little  human  resource  planning  and \n10. \nmanagement  has  taken  place  for  the  health  sector  in  Uzbekistan.  The  country  currently  has \n250,000 nurses (or 10 nurses per 1,000 population), with 54 nursing colleges offering diploma \nprograms.  The  colleges have  outdated  curriculum  and  teaching  methodologies.  Nurses  play a \ncritical role in WCH; however, currently the nursing profession holds a low status in society and \nroles are not well defined. Although the Government has plans to improve higher education for \nnurse specialists, little effort is given to retraining of nurses and midwives for PHC and WCH.6 In \naddition,  little  effort  has  gone  into  upgrading  skills  of  professionals  such  as  obstetricians  and \n\n__________________________________ \n6   United  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development  (UK-DFID)  and  Health-I  introduced  a  patronage \n(community)  nurses  short  retraining  program.  Recently,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development-\nfunded ZdravPlus Project initiated a patronage nurses retraining program in Fergana oblast. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\npediatricians,  who  are  not  trained  in  the  modern  curriculum  of  international  standards,  and \ntherefore  often  use  outdated  procedures  and  protocols.7  The  WCHDP  has  an  opportunity  to \nstrengthen the human resource development and skills of health personnel working in WCH. \n \nHealth Care Financing.  The public sector resource allocation for health as a share of \n11. \ngross domestic product (GDP) has declined steadily since independence, and in particular since \nthe mid-1990s (from 4.6% in 1995 to 2.7% in 2002). 8 Although public sector health expenditure \nhas  increased  in  nominal  and  per  capita  terms,  it  has  declined  both  in  real  terms  and  as  a \nproportion of total government spending (from 10.1% in 1997 to 9.1% in 2002). Despite efforts \nto reform and develop PHC, in 2003 76% of the national budget and 65% of local budgets went \nto  hospitals.  In  addition,  personnel  remuneration  as  a  share  of  the  budget9  has  increased \nsignificantly  (from  40%  in  1990  to  63%  in  2002)  as  a  result  of  increased  wages,  but  without \nrationalization  of  public  sector  employees.  Staff-related  spending  as  a  proportion  of  recurrent \nexpenditures  therefore  accounts  for  70%  of  spending  overall,  while  in  PHC,  the  proportion  is \nover  80%.  These  shares  reflect  the  long-standing  practice  of  funding  facilities  by  inputs,  and \nresulted in acute deficits in nonsalary recurrent budgets.  \n \n12. \nFurther, wide inter-regional inequities in financing exist. Regions with a higher incidence \nof poverty spent less per capita on health care than richer regions. A recent study indicates that \nthe poorest income quintile spent about 22% of household consumption on health care, while it \nreceived just under 15% of the benefits of public spending, whereas, the highest income quintile \nreceived  about  30%  of  the  benefits  of  public  spending.10  Pooling  resources  at  the  oblast  level \nhas the potential to improve equity in spending.  \n \nIntroducing  different  financial  incentives  to  promote  greater  efficiency  has  considerable \n13. \npotential to reshape the system. In Fergana oblast, SVPs in a few pilot rayons are being funded \non  a  per  capita  basis  and  allowed  to  retain  savings,  a  move  that  appears  to  contribute  to \nimproved  financial  performance  and  increased  utilization.11  The  Government  is  committed  to \nrolling out this reform in SVPs throughout the country. Similarly, new financial incentives have \nthe potential to improve efficiency at CRHs and oblast hospitals.  \n \n14. \nProject  Rationale.  The  WCHDP  is  justified  on  grounds  that  it  will  support  the  health \nsector reform initiative, and strengthen services that have (i) positive externalities, given that it \nwill focus on PHC; and (ii) merit goods, as it will directly impact WCH, reduce unnecessary use \nof hospitals, and provide better information to consumers. \n \nLessons Learned. ADB has been providing assistance to the Government through TA \n15. \nand loans, since the mid-1990s. While other funding agencies have been active in the country\u2019s \nhealth  sector,  this  is  the  first  ADB  project  in  the  sector.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  health  related \nprojects,  and  other  development  agencies\u2019  experience  in  the  health  sector  in  Uzbekistan \n(Appendix 2) have provided several significant lessons that were considered in project design. \nThe importance of aid coordination to ensure consistent policy approaches is one of these. The \nWCHDP staff will work closely with other international agencies, and implement the WCHDP in \nparallel with Health-II.  \n__________________________________ \n7   United  States  Agency  for  International  Development-funded  project,  Project  Hope  will  develop  training  materials \n\nand train trainers in their project sites, targeting obstetricians and gynecologists at hospitals.  \n\n8   World Bank. 2004. Public Expenditure Review, (draft), Washington, DC. \n9  The Government of Uzbekistan budget is broken down into four chapters within recurrent expenditure: (i) personnel \n\nremuneration and benefits, (ii) medicine, (iii) operation and maintenance, and (iv) building repairs. \n\n10  World Bank. 2003. Uzbekistan Living Standards Assessment, Washington, DC. \n11  The  financial  system  of  per  capitation  of  SVPs  was  pilot  tested  with  support  from  Health-I  and  United  States \n\nAgency for International Development -funded ZdravPlus Project.  \n\n \n\n\f  5\n\n \n16. \nFew  retraining  programs  exist  in  the  country.  Health-I  found  that  when  equipment  was \nprovided  with  training  programs,  its  impact  on  beneficiaries  was  far  greater,  as  it  improved \nutilization  and  consumer  satisfaction  due  to  improved  quality  of  services.  In  addition,  the \nsustainability  of  training  programs  was  crucial.  The  WCHDP  stresses  continuing  training \nprogram development, and links equipment with the needed training. \n \n17. \nUnder  Health-I,  pharmaceuticals  were  to  be  procured  through  loan  funds.  However, \nnumerous  difficulties  were  faced  in procurement  and  distribution,  and  the  loan  funds  were  not \nutilized for drugs. Subsequently, the Government and World Bank decided that no drugs would \nbe procured through Health-II. The WCHDP takes a similar approach to procurement of drugs \nand  supplies.  To  address  the  lack  of  pharmaceuticals  in  many  health  facilities,  the  WCHDP \nincludes  appropriate  Government  assurances  to  address  the  issue  early  on.  Other  projects \nemphasize  that  the  provision  of  only  equipment  and  supplies,  without  strengthening  logistical \nand  distribution  systems,  will  not  have  the  needed  sustainable  impact.  The  WCHDP \nemphasizes  strengthening  these  systems:  blood  transfusion  supply,  health  management \ninformation, and provider payment. \n \n18. \nHousehold  surveys  have  indicated  that  the  poor  are  likely  to  live  in  rural  rather  than \nurban areas, the rural poor are more likely to use PHC clinics than hospitals, and rural WCH are \nlikely  to  be  at  lower  level  health  care  facilities.  The  WCHDP  takes  these  conclusions  into \nconsideration  in  project  site  selection  and  design,  to  have  the  greatest  impact  on  the \nbeneficiaries. \n \nImplementation  experience  under  several  projects  in  Uzbekistan,  including  a  regional \n19. \nproject for improving nutrition of mothers and children highlighted weak institutional capacity of \nGovernment  agencies  for  project  implementation.  To  reduce  the  risk  of  implementation \nproblems and delays, the WCHDP will provide training to the project implementation staff early \non, and monitor progress closely through a strengthened system of procurement, disbursement, \nand financial management. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n20. \nThe  WCHDP\u2019s  goal  is  to  help  the  Government  achieve  the  health  related  MDGs  by \nreducing  maternal  and  child  mortality  and  morbidity,  and  reducing  infectious  diseases  by \nfocusing  on  the  rural  poor  and  vulnerable  populations.  To  achieve  this,  the  WCHDP  has  two \nbroad objectives: (i) to support health sector reform initiatives, and (ii) to improve the efficiency \nof health delivery system for WCH. \n \n21. \nThe WCHDP aims to (i) support the reform agenda for integrating PHC into the medical \ncare  system;  (ii)  update  WCH  policy  to  international  standards,  strengthen  referrals,  and \nconsolidate  WCH  services;  (iii)  optimize  human  resource  development,  and  build  the \ninstitutional capacity for retraining; (iv) improve the capacity for preventing the spread of blood-\nborne  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS  by  building  the  nationwide  blood  safety  program;  and  (v) \nsupport  reform  efforts  in  health  care  finance,  and  build  capacity  to  manage  these  reforms  for \nequitable  access  to  services,  and  an  efficient  health  system.  The  project  framework  is  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nThe WCHDP will strengthen national and local programs. The health systems in 6 of the \n22. \n13 oblasts will be strengthened\u2014 the oblasts of Buhkara, Fergana (the pilot site), Kashkadarya, \nKhorezm,  and  Tashkent,  and  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan.  Additional  oblasts  may  be \nselected during the midterm review, subject to availability of resources. Poverty and poor health \noutcome  criteria  were  used  to  select  the  oblasts.12  The  WCHDP  covers  36%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation,  43%  of  the  country\u2019s  poor,  and  53%  of  the  country\u2019s  extremely  poor.  The  blood \nsafety  program  and  institutional  strengthening  for  retraining  of  nurses  and  midwives  will  be \nnationwide.  Some  national  policy  initiatives  and  strategies  will  be  developed.  Project  oblasts \ncharacteristics are described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n23. \nThe WCHDP and the Health-II Project. The ADB and World Bank health projects were \ndesigned  in  parallel  to  complement  each  other  and  will  be  implemented  in  parallel.  The \nconceptual  framework  of  components  1  and  2  of  the  WCHDP  build  on  results  from  Health-I. \nUnder component 1, the WCHDP, in collaboration with Health-II, will complete the strengthening \nof SVPs nationwide. The projects have a clear division of labor. The WCHDP will strengthen the \nfirst  referral  systems  at  the  CRH  level,  while  Health-II  will  strengthen  SVPs.  The  WCHDP  will \nbuild the capacity of nurses and midwives, while Health-II  will develop the capacity of general \nmedical  practitioners  nationwide.  The  WCHDP  will  develop  the  capacity  of  health  facility \nmanagers,  while  Health-II  will  develop  the  capacity  of  facility  financial  officers.  Both  projects \nsupport quality monitoring and improvement, but with different foci: the WCHDP will concentrate \non  aspects for  WCH  care,  while  Health-II  will  focus  on  general  PHC.  In  addition,  the  WCHDP \nintroduces some new elements to health sector policy for WCH, and focus on building a health \ndelivery  system  for  WCH  that  will  strengthen  and  streamline  the capacity  of  SVPs and  CRHs. \nThe results of the pilot in Fergana oblast will help replicate the model within the WCHDP sites. \nThe functional split between the two projects is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n24. \nUnder  component  2,  the  WCHDP  will  focus  on  new  initiatives  on  broad  health  care \nfinancing  issues,  while  Health-II  will  retain  the  focus  on  the  provider  payment  system,  and \nexpand  the  system  to  hospitals.  In  addition,  the  WCHDP  will  take  the  lead  in  developing  the \nframework for reforming the health management information system (HMIS). Under component \n3, the WCHDP will strengthen the blood safety program, and Health-II will focus on public health \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  increasing  activities  for  the  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and \ntuberculosis.  \n \n25. \nThe WCHDP and the Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s Project on Health. \nComplementing  the  WCHDP,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  is  funding  a \nhealth  project  focusing  on  developing  a  model  for  a  diploma  program  for  nurses  under  the  5-\nyear Nurses Education Improvement Project, and a model district health delivery system in one \noblast under the Comprehensive Healthcare Reform Program for Navoi oblast. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n26. \nThe  WCHDP  comprises  four  components:  (i)  strengthening  WCH  services;  (ii) \nstrengthening finance, information, and management; (iii) building a blood safety program; and \n(iv)  improving  project  management.  Component  1  will  build  the  primary  care  and  first  referral \nnetwork  for  WCH,  with  improved  quality  of  services  and  capacity  of  medical  and  paramedical \npersonnel  to  provide  international  standards  of  health  care.  Component  2  will  improve  the \nefficiency of the health system by improving payment mechanisms, management, and access to \n\n__________________________________ \n12  Project  site  selection  criteria  included  high  levels  of  maternal  mortality,  anemia  among  pregnant  women,  infant \n\nmortality, child malnutrition, prevalence of Tuberculosis, and poor access to water. \n\n \n\n\f  7\n\ntimely  information.  Component  3  will  reduce  the  spread  of  blood-borne  infectious  diseases, \nincluding  HIV/AIDS,  by  building  a  nationwide  blood  safety  program.  Component  4  will \nstrengthen the capacity of project management, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1. Strengthening Woman and Child Health Services \n\n27. \nThe component will support the Government in building a WCH component in the health \nsystem. It will support replication of a nationwide system of PHC at the first level of care (SVP), \nwith  the  goal  of  strengthening  the  quality  of  preventive  and  basic  curative  care.  It  will  support \nstrengthening  the  primary  and  referral  links  for  WCH  at  the  CRHs,  while  rationalizing  WCH \nservices  at  the  oblast  hospitals.  This  component  emphasizes  optimization  of  WCH  services, \ndemedicalization,  upgrading  medical  and  paramedical  skills  on  WCH  to  meet  international \nstandards, and quality monitoring. Community empowerment will be enhanced by disseminating \nhealth information. \n \n28. \nStrengthening  Referral  Links  for  WCH.  The  subcomponent  will  provide  technical \nsupport  to  the  Government  to  reorganize  the  health  system  for  WCH  in  the  project  oblasts. \nCRHs  should  provide  outpatient  and  backup  care  to  SVPs  in  pediatrics  and  obstetrics,  and \ncontinue to provide reproductive health care for labor, deliveries, and early neonatal care. The \nProject  will  consolidate  the  capacity  at  CRH  polyclinics  for  outpatient  care,  pediatric  services, \nand diagnostic and laboratory support services. The management and organization of the oblast \npediatric  and  maternity  hospitals  will  be  integrated  within  the  health  system  as  the  referral \nfacilities for patients transferred from CRHs, and that of providing intensive care services.   \n \nEquipping  for  WCH  Functions.  The  subcomponent  will  provide  support  for  WCH \n29. \nservices,  primarily  SVPs,  CRHs,  and  selected  WCH-related  oblast  hospitals  through  a  wide \nrange  of  inputs,  including  training,  capacity  building,  and  provision  of  equipment.  Local \ngovernments will support civil works (mostly renovations) and improve essential services, such \nas  the  regular  supply  of  clean  water,  sanitation,  heating,  and  appropriate  medical  and  non-\nmedical  waste  management  in  the  project  facilities.  The  Government  will  provide  ambulances \nfor CRHs and oblast hospitals, and recurrent costs for these facilities. \n \nThe  WCHDP  will  procure  equipment  for  WCH-related  facilities,  primarily  CRHs  and \n30. \noblast  hospitals,  subject  to  confirmation  by  MOH  and  satisfactory  to  ADB  that  SVP  upgrading \nand  equipping  will  be  covered  by  the  Government  or  through  external  funding. Equipment  will \nbe procured in two phases. In phase 1 (first 2 years of WCHDP) equipment will be procured for \nCRHs  and  oblast  hospitals  in  3\u20134  oblasts:  Fergana  (pilot  site),  Khorezm,  and  the  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan  (the  three  oblasts  where  Health-I  has  already  procured  equipment  for  SVPs), \nand a possible fourth oblast to be determined at the start of implementation in consultation with \nthe Government and Health II. In phase 2 (after the midterm review of WCHDP), equipment will \nbe procured in additional oblasts: Bukhara, Kashkadariya, and Tashkent. Following two years of \nimplementation, the midterm review will be held jointly with the Government, and in consultation \nwith  Health-II.  The  overall  progress  of \nthe \nconstruction/renovation  and  equipment  provision  for  SVPs,  CRHs,  and  oblast  hospitals.  If  the \nmidterm review is satisfactory and shows that adequate progress has been made in equipping \nSVPs in the project oblasts, the WCHDP will proceed with phase 2 procurement. If the midterm \nreview  notes  actual  or  anticipated  shortcomings  in  financing  for  equipment  of  SVPs,  then  the \nGovernment, ADB, and World Bank will jointly review options to address these shortcomings.13 \n\nthe  WCHDP  will  be  reviewed \n\nincluding \n\n__________________________________ \n13  The WCHDP has allocated budget for the equipment of SVPs in the Project site, incase project funds are required. \n\nOtherwise, these project funds will be allocated to equip the CRHs and oblast hospitals in additional oblasts. \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nIf  the  midterm  review  concludes  that  actual  and  anticipated  financing  for  SVPs  is  adequate, \nSVPs  have  been  constructed/renovated  according  to  set  standards,  and  that  the  essential \npackage of equipment for SVPs has been procured, then the WCHDP may consider including \nadditional oblasts (selected on project site selection criteria set out in footnote 12) to receive the \nessential package of equipment for CRHs and oblast hospitals. \n \n31.  With  support  from  the  Government  budget  and  external  funding,  793  SVPs  in  the  five \nproject oblasts will be provided with a basic package of essential PHC equipment, furniture, and \nsupplies. Health-I tested the use of the initial package of SVP equipment, which is rationalized \nto emphasize WCH, is standardized, and will be procured nationwide. The WCHDP will develop \nstandards and staff training for the appropriate use of equipment and medical supplies.  \n \nAt  least  81  CRHs  in  the  project  oblasts  will  be  provided  with  a  basic  essential  WCH \n32. \nequipment  package.  Rationalization  of  services,  equipment,  and  skills  has  resulted  in  an \nessential package of WCH equipment for WCH wards, neonatal care, and WCH diagnostics, to \nstart  building  the  WCH  system  for  CRHs.  The  essential  package  for  obstetrical  services \nincludes  normal  deliveries  to  cesarean  section,  anesthesia,  blood  replacement,  manual \nprocedures,  and  monitoring  of  labor.  The  essential  package  for  neonatal  care  includes \nresuscitation equipment for children. The basic biochemical laboratory equipment package will \nbe adopted by both the WCHDP and Health-II after a needs-assessment and inventory survey. \nWith support from the WCHDP, 6 oblast pediatric and maternity hospitals will be provided with a \npackage of essential WCH equipment. In addition, in the pilot site, a feasibility study and pilot \nwill  be  conducted  on  the  best  practices  and  most  cost-effective  intervention  to  address  a \nneonatal intensive care referral system for the oblast.  \n \n33. \nContinuing  Education  for  WCH.  The  subcomponent  will  provide  capacity  building, \ntraining,  and  a  basic  package  of  training  equipment  to  support  the  Government  in  raising  the \nquality of education for nurses and midwives to international standards. The subcomponent will \n(i)  support  the  reform  of  education  for  nurses  and  midwives,  strengthen  policy  dialogue  and \ndevelopment,  build  teaching  capacity,  and  strengthen  diploma  and  baccalaureate  programs; \nand  (ii)  build  a  nationwide  cascading  program  from  central  to  oblast  to  rayon  levels,  to  retrain \nnurses  and  midwives  currently  working  in  the  health  system.  Retraining  will  be  targeted  at \nnurses  and  midwives  in  CRHs  and  SVPs,  who  provide  outreach  services;  who  empower \ncommunities on aspects of public health, prevention, nutrition, and basic curative care; and who \nprovide services at facilities. Around 12,000 patronage nurses and midwives will be retrained.  \n \nIn addition, the WCHDP will support the Government in building a continuing education \n34. \nprogram to retrain the team of health care providers dealing with obstetrics and pediatrics in the \nproject oblasts. Activities will be supported at the national level by capacity building, curriculum \ndevelopment, and teacher training at the Tashkent Institute of Advanced Medical Education, the \ntwo  Tashkent  medical  institutes  (TASHMI  1  and  2),  and  the  Tashkent  Pediatric  Institute. \nRetraining  programs  will  be  focused  at  the  oblasts,  the  training  centers  will  be  linked  to  the \nnational  institutes,  and  capacity  strengthened  to  retrain  this  cadre  of  workers.  Generally,  the \nWorld  Health  Organization  recommended  modules  for  child  health:  integrated  management  of \nchildhood  illnesses,  breastfeeding  and  weaning  practices;  and  for  women:  safe  motherhood, \nand promoting effective perinatal care, will be adapted. The training will stress the team concept \nfor  WCH  care  (midwife,  obstetrician,  pediatrician,  neonatologist,  anesthesiologist,  operating \nroom staff, and laboratory staff). Approximately, 2,500 medical doctors will be retrained.  \n \n35. \nQuality  Monitoring  and  Improvement  of  WCH.  The  subcomponent  will  provide \ntechnical  support  to  the  Government  to  build  capacity  of  the  Tashkent  Institute  of  Advanced \n\n \n\n\f  9\n\nMedical  Education  to  develop  evidence-based  material  for  WCH  services.14  Clinical  pathway \nprotocols  will  be  developed  for  managing  clinical  conditions  for  neonatal  and  infant  mortality, \nand  maternal  mortality.  Guidelines,  including  indicators  and  procedures  necessary  for  referral, \nwill  be  developed  regionally  with  providers  from  all  levels  of  care  and  health  administrators \nparticipating.  Quality  improvement  training  will  be  conducted  for  senior  managers  of  oblast \nhospitals  and  CRHs.  In  addition,  the  WCHDP  will  build  supervisory  capacity  at  national  and \noblast levels to monitor and improve quality of care provided for WCH services.  \n \nHealth  Education  for  WCH.  The  subcomponent  will  provide  technical  support  to  the \n36. \nGovernment to build and compile health education materials for WCH. The Republican Institute \nof Health will be involved in preparing the new messages. Patronage nurses and midwives will \nplay a key role in disseminating information.   \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2. Strengthening Finance, Information, and Management \n\nThe  component  will  support \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  reform  of  health  care \n\n37. \nfinance, \nmanagement,  and  information  systems.  It  will  build  on  ongoing  reform  efforts,  and  introduce \nselected  new  efforts  to  the  country.  While  the  component  has  a  national  focus,  much  of  the \ncapacity building will take place at district or local levels. This component will support a national \nrollout of initiatives finance and management, and will test other new initiatives. A major element \nof  this  component  is  HMIS  reform,  to  streamline  data  and  decision-making,  move  toward \nevidence-based practices, and support the decentralization of health system management.  \n \n38. \nImplementing  Financial  Reforms  to  Encourage  Efficiency.  The  subcomponent  will \nsupport  the  Government  through  capacity  building  and  training,  in  the  implementation  of  the \nrural  PHC  finance  and  management  model  developed  under  Health-I  with  support  from  the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  This  will  be  implemented  in  the  project \nsites.  A  case-based  hospital  payment  mechanism  will  be  developed,  and  initially  tested  in  the \nhospitals  in  the  WCHDP  pilot  region.  The  WCHDP  will  support  Government  initiatives  to  pool \nresources for health at the oblast level.  \n \n39. \nStrengthening  Management  Capacity  and  the  Health  Management  Information \nSystem. The subcomponent will support the Government in three elements of HMIS: capacity \nbuilding,  training,  and  the  provision  of  computer  hardware  and  software.  First,  it  will  support \nefforts to expand the population-based database in the five project oblasts piloted under Health-\nI.  Second,  the  WCHDP  will  take  the  lead  in  the  following  initiatives  at  the  national  level:  (i) \nstreamlining  and  refining  data  elements;  (ii)  setting  common  infrastructure  standards,  and \ncreating the Uzbek national health data dictionary; (iii) developing the computer literacy training \ncenter  at  the  Republican  Information  and  Analytical  Center;  and  (iv)  automating  MOH  offices. \nThird,  a  blood  bank  information  system  will  be  developed  (under  component  3).  The  ongoing \nsystem will be reviewed, and a modernized system piloted before being replicated nationwide. \n \n40. \nSupporting  Health  Sector  Policy  Reform  for  WCH.  The  WCHDP  will  strengthen \ndialogue with the Government, in coordination with other funding agencies, as well as provide \ntechnical  support  to  MOH  in  its  effort  to  update  and  strengthen  ministerial  orders  related  to \nWCH, such as maternal and child health and antenatal care. \n \n\n__________________________________ \n14  The two Tashkent medical institutes (TASHMI 1 and 2), and the Tashkent Pediatric Institute will provide technical \n\nguidance in the preparation of materials at the Tashkent Institute of Advanced Medical Education. \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3. Building a Blood Safety Program \n\n41. \nThe  WCHDP  will  support  the  Government  in  establishing  the  framework  for  a  national \nblood safety program by beginning to establish a nationwide blood provision system based on \nWorld Health Organization and International Red Cross principles. The program will be oriented \ntoward  public  health,  giving  foremost  attention  to  screening  of  blood  against  blood-borne \ninfectious  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS;  addressing  the  needs  of  all  the  population  equitably; \nensuring the use of appropriate clinical practices; and developing a sustainable national blood \nsystem.  The  collection,  distribution,  local  storage,  and  rotation  of  blood  and  blood  inventories \nwill  need  to  be  organized  and  managed  more  efficiently,  with  greater  reliance  on  routine \ntransportation  connections  between  central  blood  service  facilities  and  CRHs  and  oblast \nhospitals.  This  component  will  (i)  reform  the  organization  of  the  blood  safety  program,  (ii) \nrestructure the blood provision system, and (iii) improve the safety of donating blood. \n \n42. \nEstablishing a National Comprehensive Blood Safety Program. The subcomponent \nwill  provide  advisory  support  to  the  Government  on  restructuring  the  organization  and \nmanagement of the blood safety program. MOH should be the accountable agency for the blood \nsafety  program.  An  intersectoral  national  committee  will  need  to  be  established  under  a  high \nauthority. The committee\u2019s mandate is to (i) set policies and strategies, and build consensus for \na nationwide blood safety program; (ii) serve as a platform for consensus; (iii) identify financing \nsources;  (iv)  oversee  the  establishment  of  an  appropriate  payment  mechanism;  (v)  oversee \nappropriate  allowance  provided  for  nonsalary  recurrent  costs  in  the  budget;  (vi)  oversee  the \nfunctioning  of  the  internal  audit  system;  (vii)  oversee  the  establishment  of  a  progressive \nimplementation plan; and (viii) oversee the establishment and maintenance of quality standards \nfor regional blood establishments and laboratories, the provision of plasma derivatives through a \ncontrolled pharmaceutical production, and the improvement of operations and service. This first \nstep in program development should precede restructuring of the regional blood supply system. \n \nRestructuring the Regional Blood Transfusion Supply System. The subcomponent \n43. \nwill provide technical support to the Government for restructuring and institutional strengthening \nof  a  blood  transfusion  supply  system.  The  proposed  model  is  three tiered:  (i)  a  national  blood \ncenter for planning, coordination, needs assessment, supply of reagents, quality monitoring, and \ntraining; (ii) regional blood establishments for procurement, maintaining adequate supplies, and \ndonor  management;  and  (iii)  local  operations  for  patient  care  under  the  hospital  blood  banks, \nmaintaining rational and appropriate clinical use of the blood supplied. The WCHDP will initiate \nthe  work  through  a  pilot  site,  identified  for  this  project  component  as  the  Tashkent  region \n(including Tashkent city and oblast); initiate the national blood center; and develop the regional \nblood  establishment  and  local  operations.  At  completion  of  the  pilot,  the  results  will  be \nassessed, and the program refined and replicated nationwide. \n \nThe  subcomponent  will  provide  an  equipment  package  for  the  national  blood  center, \n44. \nregional establishments, and hospital blood banks, and will provide reagents for the first year.  \nBeyond  the  first  year,  the  Government  budget  will  support  the  reagents  and  supplies.  In \naddition,  a  training  needs-assessment  will  be  conducted,  training  modules  developed,  and \ntraining  conducted  for  the  staff  working  in  blood  transfusion  supply  system.  Evidence-based \nprotocols  for  the  appropriate  use  of  blood  and  blood  products  will  be  developed  under \ncomponent  1.  The  quality  control  mechanism  will  be  established,  the  HMIS  developed \n(component  2),  and  the  financial  sources  and  payment  mechanisms  restructured.  At  the \nnational level, the WCHDP will work with the Tashkent Institute of Advanced Medical Education \nto develop training modules and train trainers. Training will eventually be available in the oblasts \n\n \n\n\f  11\n\nand  facilities.  The  Government  will  provide  transport  facilities  for  blood  services,  building \nrepairs, as well as recurrent budgets for operations and maintenance. \n \n45. \nthe \nEncouraging  Voluntary  Blood  Donors.  The  subcomponent  will  support \nGovernment  in  its  efforts  to  encourage  regular  voluntary  nonremunerated  as  opposed  to \nnonvoluntary blood (paid and family/replacement) donors for blood donorship. Through the use \nof  public  education  campaigns,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Republican  Institute  of  Health, \nmessages  will  be  created  and  disseminated.  Nongovernment  organizations  such  as  the \nUzbekistan Red Crescent Society will be encouraged to assist in planning and implementation.  \n \nC.  \n\nSpecial Features \n\nis \n\ninitial  environmental  examination \n\nEnvironmental Assessment. Environmental conditions in the country\u2019s health facilities \n46. \nare  grossly  deficient  posing  health  risks  to  patients  and  medical  staff,  and  raising  concerns \nabout the sustainability of the environmental infrastructure. The principal weaknesses are in the \nareas of (i) water supply quantity, reliability, and quality, as few facilities have a reliable source \nof running water; (ii) sanitation, as sanitary toilets and washing facilities are often inadequate or \nunavailable;  (iii)  heating,  insulation,  indoor  air  quality,  and  ventilation  are  inadequate;  (iv) \ninadequate  clinical  waste  management;  and  (v)  solid  waste  management,  as  collection  and \ndisposal  of  waste  are  inadequate.  Many  of  these  problems  are  exacerbated  by  poor  and \nunreliable off-site services from public utilities. While these need to be addressed in the context \nof  countrywide  policies  and  comprehensive  municipal  services  programs,  the  WCHDP  is \ndesigned  to  sufficiently  mitigate  the  identified  health  risks  and  to  ensure  that  proposed \ninvestments  are  sustainable.  The  summary \nin \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n47. \nSocial Analysis. The WCHDP\u2019s investments are aimed directly at benefiting WCH, and \nits  activities  specifically  address  constraints  often  faced  by  the  poor  when  seeking  health \nservices. The WCHDP is classified as a poverty intervention, and will focus on (i) PHC, which \nprovides more than proportionate benefits to the poor; (ii) health facilities in rural areas where \nmost of the poor reside; (iii) WCH issues that impact disproportionately on the rural poor; and \n(iv)  relatively  poorer  regions  of  the  country.  In  addition  to  the  WCHDP's  emphasis  on  WCH, \ncomponents include institutional strengthening for retraining of health personnel, especially to lift \nthe status and profile of nurses and midwives who are primarily female. The summary poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  4.  During  project  preparation,  two  coordinated \nsocial  assessment  studies  focused  on  (i)  consumers  of  health  services  and  (ii)  health  care \nproviders. The summary of the social analysis study is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n48. \nEconomic Analysis and Fiscal Impact. The cost-effectiveness analysis shows that the \nmost  frequent  causes  of  death  among  infants  can  be  addressed  during  the  WCHDP,  over  5 \nyears  between  25%  to  40%  of  deaths  could  be  eliminated,  and  over  20  years,  approximately \n60%.  While  the  analysis  focuses  on  infant  deaths,  many  of  these  interventions  should  also \nreduce infant distress and morbidity. Consequently, the total health benefits, as measured by a \ncomposite  measure  such  as  disability-adjusted  life  years  would  be  significantly  greater.  The \nrecurrent budget implications of the WCHDP for the Government amounts to about $1.3 million \nannually. This is about 4.3% of the annual health budgets of the five oblasts, or about 1.2% of \nthe  total  annual  national  health  budget.  If  the  recurrent  budget  implications  of  Health-II  is \nincluded,  the  total  health  budget  would  increase  by  2.4%  annually.  Most  of  this  additional \nnonsalary  recurrent  cost  should  already  be  a  part  of  the  Government  budget,  given  that  the \nWCHDP  does  not  involve  any  new  construction.  However,  several  facilities  are  currently \nunderfunded  for  nonsalary  recurrent  share.  The  Government  is  committed  to  providing \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nnonsalary recurrent budget. The incremental cost of the WCHDP to the Government is limited, \nand  sustainable  beyond  the  project  cycle.  The  summary  economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  5, \nand economic and financial analyses in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nD.  \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n49. \nThe cost of the WCHDP is estimated at $70.0 million equivalent. The Government asked \nADB  to  provide  a  $40.0  million  loan  to  partially  finance  the  project  cost.  The  Government  will \nprovide  $30.0  million  as  the  counterpart  funds  for  the  ADB  loan.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum, \nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  ADB  will  be \nentitled  to  withdraw  from  the  loan  account  and  pay  to  itself,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  the \namounts  required  to  meet  payments,  when  due,  of  such  interest  and  commitment  charges \nduring  project  implementation.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the bases of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication of advice from ADB.   \n \n51. \nOf the estimated WCHDP cost of $70.0 million equivalent, foreign exchange costs will be \n$35.8  million  (51%)  and  local  currency  costs  will  be  $34.1  million  equivalent  (49%).  The  cost \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\f  13\n\nestimates  are  expressed  in  2004  prices  and  include  provisions  for  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, currency movements and interest, and other charges during construction. Import \nduties  and  taxes  have  been  included  at  applicable  rates  in  the  local  currency  cost  estimates. \nThe  ADB  loan  of  $40.0  million  represents  57%  of  the  total  WCHDP  cost.  The  Government\u2019s \nshare  is  $30.0  million  equivalent,  or  43%  of  the  total  WCHDP  cost.  The  latter  share  includes \nfinancing  civil  works;  goods  delivery  cost,  registration,  customs  clearance,  certification,  taxes, \nand duties; salaries, social charges, and income taxes for oblast project implementation bureau \nstaff;  social  charges  and  income  tax  for  central  project  implementation  bureau  staff;  training \ncosts;  health  education  promotion  activities;  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  ADB  will \nfund the entire foreign exchange cost, and 12% of the local currency cost.

MOH will be the Executing Agency for the WCHDP. The project coordinator will be the \ndeputy  minister  of  the  Maternal  and  Child  Health  Department  of  MOH.  An  interagency  project \nsteering  committee,  headed  by  a  deputy  prime  minister,  will  provide  overall  guidance  for  the \nWCHDP.  The  committee,  which  will  oversee  the  parallel  implementation  of  the  WCHDP  and \nHealth-II  will  be  comprised  of  representatives  at  the  deputy  minister  level  from  the  Cabinet  of \nMinisters,  and  ministries  of  economy,  finance,  health,  labor  and  social  protection,  and  other \nInstitutions  concerned;  and  representatives  from  ADB  and  World  Bank.  Representatives  from \nthe  international  aid  community  may  be  invited  to  attend  the  steering  committee  meetings  as \nobservers.  The  project  coordinator  will  be  the  secretary.  The  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished  before  loan  effectiveness,  and  will  meet  on  a  quarterly  basis  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n54. \nA  joint  project  implementation  bureau  (JPIB)  will  be  established  within  MOH,  to \nimplement and ensure close coordination between WCHDP and Health-II. The bureau director \nwill head the JPIB, and financed either under Health-II or jointly with Health-II and the WCHDP, \nin  which  case  he/she  will  be  selected  on  an  individual  basis,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The bureau director will report to the project coordinator. \nMeetings will be held with the JPIB, monthly or as often as may be required, and headed by the \nproject coordinator. The JPIB organizational framework is in Supplementary Appendix F. Under \nthe  JPIB  and  the  direction  of  the  bureau  director,  three  departments  will  be  set  up:  (i)  joint \nadministrative unit, (ii) technical unit for the WCHDP, and (iii) technical unit for Health-II. Under \nthe  WCHDP,  11  full-time  staff  (10  for  the  JPIB,  and  1  to  support  the  oblast  project \nimplementation  bureaus  [OPIB]),  will  be  hired  for  project  implementation,  and  financed  by  the \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nloan. These staff will be contracted on an individual basis, in accordance with transparent and \ncompetitive  recruitment  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  JPIB  will  be  responsible  for \nprocurement, accounting, financial management, office management, and related administrative \ntasks;  the  team  will  be  funded  through  the  WCHDP  and  Health-II.  Under  the  WCHDPs \nadministrative unit, 5 full-time staff will be hired under the loan, including financial management, \naccounting and disbursement, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and office management. \nEach project will staff its own technical units. For the WCHDP\u2019s technical unit, 5 full-time staff \nwill be hired under the loan, including deputy project manager, and 4 component coordinators: \nmedical/public  health;  blood  banking;  finance,  management,  and  information;  and  training \ncoordinator. In addition, an OPIB will be established in each of the project oblasts. Each OPIB \nwill  have  two  professional  government  staff:  (i)  OPIB  manager,  and  (ii)  oblast  technical \ncomponent  coordinator.  The  staff  of  the  OPIBs  will  be  employed  and  financed  by  the \nGovernment,  and  will  be  housed  in  the  offices of  the  oblast  health  department,  through  which \nthey  will  closely  coordinate  their  activities.  OPIB  staff  will  report  to  the  bureau  director,  and  to \nthe head of the oblast health department, and meet with the JPIB through monthly or quarterly \nmeetings.  The  OPIBs  will  oversee  WCHDP  activities  within  their  respective  oblasts,  including \ncivil works, delivery and installation of equipment, training, and related follow-up at local levels. \nOne full-time environmental engineer will be hired  under the loan specifically for the OPIBs to \nmonitor quality of civil works and to ensure equipment placement and use.  \n \nTo  ensure  coordination  of  similar  or  related  components,  a  number  of  working  groups, \n55. \nworking  on  a  voluntary  basis,  will  be  formalized  (many  of  the  first  steps  were  taken  during \nproject  preparation).  Of  the  eight  working  groups,15  some  will  be  joint  with  Health-II.  Some \ngroups are already established, and others will be established before loan effectiveness\u2014each \nwith representation from the WCHDP, Health-II, MOH, other relevant government agencies, and \nother  funding  agencies  where  appropriate.  Working  groups  will  coordinate  activities,  prepare \nissues papers, prepare implementation plans, and follow up on concerns. They will report to the \nproject coordinator, and will meet at least once in a quarter, or as frequently as required. The \nJPIB and all consultants will consult closely with the working groups. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  WCHDP  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  approximately  January  2005  to \n\n56. \nDecember 2009. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n57.  MOH  will  procure  all  goods  and  related  services  and  civil  works  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  JPIB  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement,  and  the \nJPIB\u2019s  technical  team  will  be  responsible  for  the  procurement  packaging.16  A  list  of  indicative \nprocurement  packages  is  in  Appendix  8.  The  local  governments  will  be  responsible  for \nfinancing,  procurement  and  monitoring,  and  civil  works  contracts,  which  consist  of  the \nconstruction or renovation of SVPs, and renovation of WCH units and laboratories in the CRHs \nand oblast hospitals, training centers, and blood centers in targeted oblasts. \n\n__________________________________ \n15 Working groups include: (i) continuing medical education for WCH care medical and para-medical staff, (ii) nursing \nprogram,  (iii)  blood  banking,  (iv)  finance  and  management,  (v)  HMIS,  (vi)  civil  works  and  environmental \nmanagement, (vii) WCH policy reform, and (viii) restructuring health delivery system. \n\n16  Equipment and supply contracts valued in excess of $500,000 will be carried out through international competitive \nbidding. Equipment and supply contracts valued $500,000 or less will be procured following international shopping \nor  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Supply  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  or  less  may  be  procured  following \nlocal competitive bidding or direct purchase procedures. \n\n \n\n\f  15\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n(115  person-months)  and  16  domestic  consultants \n\n58.  MOH will recruit international and domestic consultants. The consultants will be engaged \nby the JPIB either individually or through consulting firms. Recruitment of consultants will follow \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \ndomestic  consultants.  Advance  recruitment  action  will  be  used  for  consultants.  ADB\u2019s  quality-\nand-cost  based  selection  method  will  apply  for  consulting  firms.  Twenty-two  international \nconsultants \n(239  person-months) \nspecializing in (i) medical education, (ii) nursing/ midwifery education and retraining, (iii) medical \nequipment, (iv) quality monitoring and evidence-based medicine, (v) blood safety program and \ntransfusion, (vi) health systems, (vii) management, (viii) HMIS, (ix) economics and finance, and \n(x) project management. Tentative consulting services requirements are in Appendix 9.  \n \n59. \nThe WCHDP will also carry out a wide range of training programs at the national, oblast, \nand  rayon  levels.  Several  training  institutions  have  been  selected  to  provide  training  at  the \ncentral  level  given  their  ongoing  leadership  and  potential  to  build  capacity  for  these  training \nprograms.  In  the  oblasts,  the  WCHDP  will  identify  the  potential  training  institutions  to  be \nconnected to clinical practice training opportunities, such as hospitals or clinics, and to provide \ntraining. A summary of training programs is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n60. \nThe withdrawal of loan proceeds will be in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, as amended from time to time. The JPIB will use the imprest account and statement \nof  expenditure  procedures.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  within  1  month  of  loan \neffectiveness  in  a  reputable  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  initial  amount  of \n$500,000  is  expected  to  cover  expenditures  for  6  months.  Total  advances  to  the  imprest \naccount should not exceed 10% of the loan amount. The statement of expenditure procedures \nwill be used to reimburse, liquidate, and replenish the imprest account for eligible expenditures \nnot exceeding $20,000 per payment.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nto  accounting  standards  acceptable \n\nThe Government will ensure that records, accounts, and related financial statements are \n61. \nadequately  maintained  according \nto  ADB  (using \ninternational  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  benchmarks).  The  reports  should  identify \ngoods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  The  JPIB  will  maintain  separate  project \naccounts, and will prepare the project accounts and the related financial statements, including \nfor  the  imprest  account  and  records  of  the  statement  of  expenditures.  Project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. ADB \nwill finance the audit. Certified copies of such audited accounts and financial statements will be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  in  English  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  fiscal  year  to  which  the  report \nrelates. The costs related to the annual auditing of the project accounts will be financed from the \nloan proceeds provided that the qualification, selection, and terms of reference of the auditors \nare  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  will  inform  the  JPIB  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited \nfinancial statements and the penalties for noncompliance.  \n \n62. \nDuring  project  preparation  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  Central  Project \nImplementation  Bureau  of  MOH  under  Health-I  was  assessed.  The  assessment  was  to \ndetermine  the  adequacy  of  the  agency\u2019s  financial  management  practices  and  procedures  for \nimplementing the proposed loan. The financial management assessment concluded that Central \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nProject  Implementation  Bureau  procedures  are  sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  the  loan,  but \nidentified  areas  that  could  be  strengthened.  The  summary  and  recommendations  of  the  study \nare in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nThe JPIB will submit reports on the implementation of project-funded activities within 30 \n63. \ndays  after  the  end  of  each  quarter.  The  quarterly  reports  will  include  progress  made  against \nestablished targets, problems encountered during the quarter, steps taken and steps proposed \nto resolve the problems, compliance with loan covenants, and project activities to be undertaken \nduring the next quarter. All reports will be submitted in English. Within 3 months after physical \ncompletion, the JPIB will submit a project completion report to ADB. The completion report will \ninclude an evaluation of the WCHDP\u2019s impact on the beneficiaries. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n64. \nThe indicators selected for project monitoring and evaluation are itemized in the project \nframework (Appendix 3). The JPIB will be responsible for overall data collection, analysis, and \nreporting  to  interested  parties,  including  ADB.  Service  delivery  and  health  impact  will  be \nmonitored through regular reports, monitoring and evaluation unit set up at the JPIB, and routine \ndata collection through the HMIS. Qualitative methods to assess beneficiary impact will be used \nfor the midterm review and at the end of the WCHDP.  \n  \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n65. \nAt  WCHDP  inception,  a  baseline  study  will  be  conducted  within  the  first  6  months  of \nproject  effectiveness,  and  prior  to  any  major  disbursements.  Pilot  tests  on  new  strategies  in \ncomponent 1 will be carried out in Fergana oblast. Their results will be evaluated and reflected \nin the procurement packages, training curricular, before replication in the project oblasts. ADB, \nthe Government, JPIB, and the World Bank will jointly review project progress at least twice a \nyear, and will undertake a midterm review of the WCHDP and Health-II during the third year of \nProject  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  implementation \narrangements,  and  other  relevant  issues  in  light  of  the  Government\u2019s  health  reform  and \ndevelopment  strategies  and  policy  framework;  (ii)  identify  changes  since  the  time  of  the \nappraisal relating to sector issues and resource management and allocation, and reassess their \nimpact  on  future  project  implementation  and  sustainability;  (iii)  review  implementation \nperformance of all components; (iv) review progress in achieving the measurable objectives of \nthe  WCHDP; \nformulate  appropriate \nrecommendations  for  corrective  action.  The  midterm  review  will  also  assess  the  status  of  the \nconstruction/renovation and equipment provision for SVPs, CRHs and oblast hospitals. If there \nare  actual  or  anticipated  shortcomings  in  financing  for  equipment  of  SVPs,  the  Government, \nADB, and World Bank will jointly review options to address these shortcomings. \n \n\nidentify  problems  and  constraints;  and \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n66. \nThe TA will complement the WCHDP by strengthening MOH\u2019s capacity to address WCH \nservice  delivery  more  efficiently  and  effectively,  and  to  sustain  its  development.  The  TA  will \nhave  three  components:  (i)  conduct  a  study  on  the  causes  of  child  mortality,  (ii)  carry  out  an \noptimization exercise to rationalize and integrate health delivery services and human resources, \nand (iii) develop a strategy to improve quality monitoring of WCH services. \n \n67.  MOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA.  The  TA  will  provide  8  person-months  of \ninternational consulting, with specialists in the areas of morbidity and mortality surveys, health \n\n \n\n\f  17\n\nsystems  development,  human  resource  planning,  and  quality  monitoring.  The  TA  will  also \nprovide  24  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  with  specialists  in  health  surveys,  health \nsystems  development,  quality  monitoring,  and  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks.  The  domestic \nconsultants will be part of the team working with the international consultants. The international \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  individually  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for domestic consultants. International \nconsultants will nominate suitable candidates for domestic consultants for ADB\u2019s engagement. \nProcurement of office equipment will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n68. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $353,000  equivalent,  of  which  $230,000  is  the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $123,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $300,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of $230,000 and \n$70,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal currency cost through the provision of counterpart staff, office space, and furniture for TA \nadministration,  workshop  facilities,  and  transport  and  allowances  of  government  officials.  The \nTA is to be financed by ADB on a grant basis through the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The detailed description of the TA is in Appendix 11. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n69. \nEquitable Access to Health Services for the Poor and Vulnerable Population. The \nWCHDP  targets  the  rural  poor  and  vulnerable  populations,  and  focuses  its  investments  to \nbenefit the poor, shifting resources normally allocated to hospitals in urban settings to PHC. The \nWCHDP will allocate about 60% of the loan and counterpart investments for PHC. \n \n70. \nIncreased Efficiency. The WCHDP will introduce financial reforms designed to improve \nefficiency while shifting resources to the poor. Allocating budgets to SVPs on a per capita basis, \neliminating  input-based  budgeting  in  local  hospitals,  and  introducing  retention  of  savings  are \nexpected to stimulate greater efficiency. In the long run, if the financial reforms introduced in the \nWCHDP  are  effective,  hospitals  are  expected  to  have  fewer,  but  better  paid  staff,  which  is \nexpected to reduce informal payments that hamper access to services by the poor. \n \nStrengthened  Institutional  Capacity.  Building  institutional  capacity  for  retraining \n71. \nmedical  and  paramedical  staff,  providing \nfor  health  service  managers,  and \ntraining \nstrengthening  the  HMIS,  will  improve  decision-making  at  every  level  of  the  health  system. \nStrengthened capacity will improve quality of services, and effectiveness of health delivery. \n \n72. \nImproved Health Status. The WCHDP is expected to reduce both the MMR and IMR. \nMeasuring progress in the MMR over the 5-year life of the WCHDP may be difficult, as maternal \ndeaths are rare and a large number of births are required to track changes accurately over time. \nThe IMR offers better opportunities for measuring change. Estimates suggest that over half of \ninfant  deaths  under  1  year,  are  within  the  first  7  days\u2014attributable  largely  to  asphyxia  and \nsepsis.  These  and  related  causes  are  being  addressed  by  several  WCHDP-supported \ninterventions  and  their  impact  is  expected  to  be  substantial\u2014an  almost  40%  decrease  in  the \nIMR is anticipated in the project oblasts in 5 years and about 60% over 20 years. \n \nControl  Of  Infectious  Diseases.  Unsafe  blood,  and  its  inappropriate  use,  can  have  a \n73. \nsubstantial, even devastating, impact on the incidence of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and other blood-\nborne infections. The incidence of HIV/AIDS in Uzbekistan is still low but rising rapidly. Hepatitis \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nC, contracted through contaminated blood and other body fluids, is common among paid blood \ndonors. The WCHDP will help build the blood collection system, move away from paid donors, \nimprove blood-screening techniques, and strengthen the manufacturing of blood products. Even \nwith a safer blood supply, a risk is involved every time blood is administered. The introduction of \nclinical  protocols  for  safe  and  appropriate  blood  use  by  physicians  will  help  conserve  blood \nresources and further reduce untoward incidences. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n74. \nFinancing  Capital  Costs.  Local  governments,  especially  in  the  relatively  poorer \nregions, may be unable to allocate sufficient resources for building renovation and construction, \nespecially those oblasts where both the WCHDP and Health-II will be active. One risk is that not \nall  civil  works  may  be  completed  satisfactorily.  Of  particular  concern  are  the  improvements \nrequired  in  water,  sanitation,  heat,  and  waste  disposal.  This  risk  may  be  mitigated  by  special \nbudgetary  support  provided  by  the  central  Government  to  support  local  governments.  The \nGovernment  has  given  assurances  that  financial  support  will  be  provided  by  the  central \nGovernment to the relatively poorer regions in the event of budgetary gaps. \n \n75. \nFinancing  Recurrent  Costs.  The  ability  of  local  governments  to  finance  increased \nrecurrent costs is of concern. The Government spent about $40 million equivalent for nonsalary \nrecurrent  expenditures  for  health  care  in  2001.  Budgets  show  that  nonsalary  recurrent \nexpenditures have decreased in real terms, in favor of the share for staff remuneration. During \nthe  life  of  the  WCHDP,  local  governments  will  have  to  make  additional  investments  for \nnonsalary recurrent expenditures, as many facilities are currently underfunded. The WCHDP will \npursue  various  mechanisms  for  efficiency  gains:  (i)  pooling  oblast  health  care  resources, \nthereby ensuring equitable distribution of funds and reducing administrative costs; (ii) supporting \nreform  of  payment  mechanisms  at  SVPs  and  CRHs,  and  retention  of  facility  savings,  thereby \nproviding incentives for better performance and for use of these savings for nonsalary recurrent \nexpenditure gaps; (ii) consolidating health facilities, and rationalizing services, thereby reducing \nthe more expensive hospital admissions, and increasing the more cost-effective SVP outpatient \nservice utilization; (iv) conducting human resource needs-based assessment and optimization; \nand (v) encouraging the Government to assess health needs, and reallocate resources to PHC.  \n \n76. \nDelays  in  Policy  Reform.  Delays  in  creating  a  supportive  policy  framework  and \napproving  necessary  policy  reforms  could  hamper  the  WCHDP\u2019s  implementation.  An  updated \nministerial order (500) in November 2003 for WCH care sets in place the necessary rules and \nguidelines for reforms in maternity and infant care. However, policy changes are still needed for \nnursing education, antenatal care, blood safety, HMIS, and health finance. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOH  have  given  the \n\n77. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n78. \nSector Reforms. The Government shall continue to implement the health care system \nreform  measures, adopted by Presidential Decree UP-2107 of 10 November 1998,  in a timely \nmanner to optimize the impact of the measures promoted under the WCHDP. \n \n\n \n\n\f  19\n\n79.  Maternal and Child Health Care. MOH shall review and update the maternal and child \nhealth  care  regulations,  including  Ministerial  Order  500  of  13  November  2003,  annually  to \nincorporate the best practices emanating from evidence-based medical practices, international \npractices,  and  lessons  learned  under  the  WCHDP.  This  should  be  achieved  within  1  year  of \nloan effectiveness. \n \n80. \nAntenatal Care. MOH shall revise Ministerial Order 100 of 19 March 2001 on antenatal \ncare  to  adopt  international  standards  of  care  and  practices  in  WCH,  which  shall  then  be \nimplemented  in  the  project  oblasts.  This  should  be  achieved  within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n \n81. \nNurse  and  Midwife  Education  Reform.  The  Government  shall  undertake  reform \nmeasures  with  respect  to  the  education  system  for  nurse  and  midwives.  In  particular,  the \nGovernment  shall  prepare  and  adopt  a  comprehensive  education  and  training  plan  including \nproposed revision of the current curriculum within 2 years of loan effectiveness.  \n \nEssential  Drugs.  MOH  shall  develop  an  essential  drug  list  for  PHC  and  WCH,  in \n82. \naccordance with World Health Organization recommendations and guidelines, and prepare and \nadopt a plan of action for the continued availability of such drugs in SVPs and  CRHs within 1 \nyear of loan effectiveness. \n \n83. \nBlood  Safety  Program.  The  Government  shall  (i)  prepare,  adopt,  and  implement  a \nnational  program  on  blood  safety  that  includes  measures  to  encourage  regular,  voluntary, \nnonremunerated  as  opposed  to  nonvoluntary  blood  (paid  and  family/replacement)  donations; \nand  (ii)  establish  an  intersectoral  national  committee  (comprising  representatives  of  MOH, \nInstitute  of  Hematology,  municipalities,  centers  for  disease  control  and  prevention,  relevant \ntraining institutes, the oblasts, and health facilities) to oversee the implementation of the national \nprogram  and  provide  guidance  on  developing  related  services.  The  committee  shall  meet  at \nleast once every quarter, or as frequently as necessary. \n \n84. \nOrganizational  Framework.  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOH  shall  develop \nand  carry  out,  on  a  pilot  basis,  an  organizational  framework  and  implementation  plan  for  an \nimproved  WCH  care  delivery  system,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  ensure  that  (i)  WCH \nwards/services/facilities  in  the  rayons  are  supported  within  the  CRH  management,  and  (ii) \neffective  referral  links  for  service  and  functions  for  WCH  care  are  created  within  and  between \nvarious facilities at community, SVP, CRH, and oblast levels.  \n \n85. \nservices and staff for WCH within 1 year from loan effectiveness. \n \nEnvironment.  MOH  shall,  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  ensure  the  project \n86. \noblasts (i) prepare in consultation with municipalities, related agencies, and MOH, development \nplans including the cost for upgrading health facilities for each oblast under the WCHDP; and (ii) \nestablish  design  and  supervision  committees  for  civil  works  in  the  oblasts  with  terms  of \nreference and composition acceptable to ADB. MOH shall also ensure that (i) Project facilities \nare  designed,  constructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nmanagement plans and the environmental rules and regulations of Uzbekistan and ADB; and (ii) \nremedial  measures  specified  in  the  environmental  management  plans  are  implemented  in  a \ntimely manner. \n\nHuman Resource Optimization. MOH shall prepare an optimization plan to rationalize \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\nFinancial  Assistance  to  Oblasts.  In  addition  to  the  loan  proceeds,  the  Government \n87. \nshall provide, in a timely manner, financial support to project oblasts to renovate SVPs, CRHs, \nand other medical facilities.  \n \nFinancial  and  Administrative  Reforms.  The  Government  shall  take  necessary \n88. \nmeasures, within 6 months of loan effectiveness, to ensure that (i) the reforms for financing and \nmanaging  the  rural  PHC  system  are  replicated  at  the  national  level,  including  pooling  of  the \nfunds  allocated  for  rural  PHC  services  at  the  oblast  level;  (ii)  the  reforms  for  hospital \nmanagement  with  respect  to  secondary  level  services  are  carried  out  in  the  Project  oblasts, \nincluding pooling of the hospital funds at the oblast level; and the hospital case-based payment \nmechanism is adopted in such hospitals; and (iii) SVPs and CRHs in the project oblasts achieve \nincreased  autonomy  in  their  respective  management  and  financing.  The  Government  shall \nensure  that  the  planned  treasury  mechanisms  of  the  Government  do  not  conflict  with  the \nfinancial  and  managerial  independence  of  the  health  delivery  services  with  respect  to  the \npooling of resources referred to under (i) and (ii). \n \n89. \nFinancing  Civil  Works.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  governments \ncomplete  the  civil  works  to  upgrade  the  physical  infrastructure  of  health  facilities  in  a  timely \nmanner prior to procuring the necessary equipment under the WCHDP. \n \n90. \nGovernment  Financing  and  Sustainability  Plan.  The  Government  shall  allocate  the \nrequired counterpart funding for the first year of project implementation in a timely manner; and \nwill  prepare  an  annual  development  plan  for  the  project  period  (5  years),  under  which \ninformation will include the number of facilities to be constructed/renovated each year, and the \ncost implications of the capital and recurrent costs of those facilities.  \n \n91. \nFinancing of SVP Equipment. If by the time of the midterm review, resources needed \nfor  SVP  equipment  procurement  in  the  Project  oblasts  are  not  available  through  Health-II  or \nother  externally  funded  projects,  then  the  Government  shall  provide  through  budgetary \nallocation, and in a timely manner, the necessary resources required to procure the equipment.   \n \n92. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Involuntary  Resettlement.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that \nthe  rehabilitation  work  undertaken  on  the  Project,  does  not  entail  any  land  acquisition, \ninvoluntary resettlement or negative environmental impact. \n \nB. \n \n93. \nThe  following  are  the  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  shall  have \nestablished (i) the JPIB and selected the bureau director in a manner satisfactory to ADB; and \n(ii) the project steering committee with terms of reference and composition acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n94. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$40,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Woman  and  Child  Health  Development \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n Tadao Chino \nPresident \n\n31 August 2004 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\n \n\n \n\nHEALTH SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nUzbekistan\u2019s Underlying Demographic and Epidemiological Situation \n\n1.  \n \nUzbekistan\u2019s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $450, is growing at about 4.2% \n1. \nper annum in 2002.1 The national income is growing at a faster rate than the population, which \nis  currently  growing  at  a  rate  of  1.9%.  About  27.5%  of  the  population  lives  in  poverty;  about \n3.3%  lives  in  extreme  poverty  in  2001.2  The  official  unemployment  rate  is  4.4%  for  2002, \nalthough  the  unofficial  rate  is  expected  to  be  higher.3  The  inflation  rate  is  declining  and  is \nreported at about 22% in 2002.4  \n \n2. \nUzbekistan,  with  a  population  of  25.3  million  in  2002,  is  undergoing  a  demographic \ntransition. The total fertility rate has declined to about 2.9 births per woman, and is projected to \nreach  a  net  reproduction  rate  of  1  by  2010.5  The  declining  fertility  rate  is  expected  to  be  the \nconsequence  of  the  new  family  planning  policy  announced  by  the  President  in  mid  1990s,  to \nensure  low-risk  pregnancy  and  safe  motherhood,  and  to  reduce  complications  due  to  closely \nspaced  pregnancies  and  pathological  conditions  among  women  of  reproductive  age.  This \ncampaign  was  supported  by  high  literacy  among  women  (83%),  women\u2019s  labor  force \nparticipation  (47%),  rising  age  at  marriage,  and  subsequently  the  1991  to  1995  economic \nrecession.  Contraceptive  prevalence  reached  65%  in  2002.  Despite  the  fall  in  birth  rates,  the \npopulation  will  keep  on  growing  in  the  coming  decade,  a  result  of  population  momentum,  and \nwill show signs of decline by 2020. Life expectancy at birth is at about 70 years overall, 66 years \nfor men, and 73 years for women. In 2000, almost 38% of the population was under 15 years of \nage, and about 4% were above 65 years, however, by 2010, the young will make up 25% of the \npopulation, and the proportion of elderly will have almost doubled. The dependency ratio of 72% \nis expected to decline substantially over the next decade, as a result of the growing labor force \nage group, and declining birth and death rates. \n \nMalnutrition  status  among  children  under-5  is  high;  in  1996  almost  31%  were  stunted, \n3. \n19%  underweight,  and  4%  of  babies  born  with  low  birth-weight.  Although  the  prevalence  of \nbreastfeeding  is  high,  only  4%  of  mothers  practice  exclusive  breastfeeding  among  under  3-\nmonth-old children.6 Hence, the health care programs need to promote practices of appropriate \nbreastfeeding, adequate weaning diet, and micronutrient deficiency. \n \n4. \nIncidence  of  infectious  disease  among  children  has  declined  substantially,  and  is \nexpected  to  be  a  result  of  high  immunization  coverage,  and  preventive  health  care  programs. \nOverall,  96%  infants  received  measles  vaccination  in  2000.  Hepatitis-B  vaccines  have  been \nintroduced,  but  coverage  remains  low.  The  infant  mortality  rate  has  been  declining;  officials \nreport  it  at  19  per  1,000  live  births  between  1998-2002.7  This  figure  cannot  be  compared \n\n__________________________________ \n1   Asian  Development  Bank.  2004.

However,  among  the  Central  Asian  republics,  Uzbekistan  reports  the  best \nachievements  in  infant  mortality  rate.  Causes  of  infant  death  are  still  related  to  infectious \ndiseases, with acute respiratory infection being the primary cause of death, and almost 50% of \ninfants  dying  within  the  first  month  of  birth.  Causes  of  child  morbidity  and  mortality  are  often \ninfluenced  by  care  given  to  the  fetus  during  pregnancy.  To  achieve  continued  improvement  in \nmaternal and infant morbidity and mortality, the country needs to provide appropriate attention \nto programs focusing on women\u2019s health care.  \n \n5. \nAbout 95% women receive antenatal care, but only 39% of these receive antenatal care \nwithin  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy\u2014many  report  iron  deficiency  anemia.  In  addition,  most \nwomen deliver at health facilities under the guidance of trained health staff (most deliveries are \nconducted  by  doctors).  However,  the  primary  cause  of  maternal  mortality  is  pregnancy  or \ndelivery complications, such as hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders. Abortions are at 90 per \n1,000  live  births.  A  1995  study  indicated  that  the  causes  of  deaths  were  primarily  due  to  ill-\nprepared  health  personnel,  insufficient  supplies,  and  inadequate  diagnostic,  treatment,  and \nreferral mechanisms. Maternal mortality has declined over the past decade and officials report it \nat  about  34  per  100,000  live  births  in  2001,  but  may  be  increasing  in  some  provinces.  This \nhighlights the importance of focused attention on the quality of health care received by women, \nand the need to better understand maternal mortality, and address concerns. \n \n6. \nAmong  adults,  a  rising  trend  is  reported  in  reemerging  infectious  diseases,  such  as \ntuberculosis  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases.  Tuberculosis  prevalence  is  about  109  per \n100,000 population and has increased in the past decade; Republic of Karakalpakstan reports \nthe  worst  tuberculosis  prevalence.  Syphilis  was  reported  at  47  cases per  100,000  in  1997,  as \ncompared with about 2 cases per 100,000 in 1991. HIV/AIDS8 prevalence is still low at less than \n0.01%, and is primarily reported among male intravenous drug users; the incidence has doubled \nover the past 2 years. \n \n7. \nUzbekistan  is  undergoing  an  epidemiological  transition,  and  the  country  reflects  a  dual \nburden of disease with both communicable and noncommunicable diseases. For example, most \nhospital  adult  admissions  are  due  to  respiratory,  digestive,  infectious,  and  cardiovascular \nproblems.  In  addition,  the  country  faces  high  adult  mortality  due  to  lifestyle  changes.  The  top \ncauses  of  adult  morality  are  circulatory  system,  respiratory,  cancer,  and  injury  and  poisoning. \nDiabetes  mortality  in  Uzbekistan  is  among  the  highest  in  the  Central  Asia  republics.  Smoking \nprevalence is high, especially among adult men (41%), but not among adult women (1%).   \n \n8. \nAmong  the  population,  60%  live  in  rural  areas.  Water  and  sanitation  access  remains \npoor overall. A mere 18% of the total population, and 46% of the urban population has access to \nadequate sanitation. Sixty-two percent of the total population, and 40% of the rural population \nhave  access  to  safe  and  running  water.  Water-borne  diseases  are  prevalent,  and  digestive \ndisorders,  including  diarrhea,  viral  hepatitis,  Hepatitis  A,  and  chronic  liver  disorders,  are \ncommon. \n \nThe  results  from  this  section  suggest  that  in  the  short-run  (10  years),  the  country  will \n9. \nface high demand for health and social care for children, and for communicable diseases. In the \nmedium-term (20 years), the demand for health needs of the young and the adults will increase, \nwith a rising trend in noncommunicable diseases, although communicable concerns will remain, \nif not addressed urgently. In the long-term, the health system will face the challenge of a shift to \n\n__________________________________ \n8   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n23\n\n \n\n \n\nOverview of Uzbekistan\u2019s Health System \n\nhealth  care  concerns  of  the  elderly  and  adults,  which  may  primarily  be  noncommunicable  in \nnature. \n \nB. \n \n10.  Management  Structure  and  Health  Programs.  The  Uzbek  health  system  was \ndeveloped under the former Soviet Union, with a strong focus on secondary and tertiary health \ncare, and an extensive network of health care facilities and specialists. Before 1991, health care \npolicy was developed, managed, and regulated from Moscow, although post-independence, this \nrole  has  shifted  to  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  headed  by  the  President.  The  role  of  the  Uzbek \nMinistry  of  Health  (MOH)  was  limited  to  implementing  the  policies  developed  in  Moscow,  but \nnow  it  includes  developing  health  care  legislation  and  regulation,  setting  standards  for  quality, \nmonitoring  quality  of  care,  monitoring  health  of  the  population,  issuing  licenses,  developing \ncurricula,  and  coordinating  international  aid  for  health.  MOH  is  responsible  for  (i)  capital \ninvestment for construction and equipment, and pharmaceuticals, (ii) maternal and child health, \n(iii)  sanitary  and  epidemiological  services,  (iv)  human  resources  and  education,  and  (v) \nmanagement and supervision of health services. In parallel to this are the health care services \ncatering  to  government  employees  and  military.  MOH  is  responsible  for  their  administration, \nwhile  medical  institutions  are  responsible  for  management  and  resources.  The  regional  health \nfacilities are administered by the regional governors (khokim) appointed by the President. \n \n11. \ndecade: \n\nThe country has several public health programs; many were introduced within the past \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nillnesses  was \n\nintroduced,  although \n\nImmunization  program  with  basic  coverage  against  childhood  diseases  now \nincludes hepatitis. Tetanus toxoid vaccines are offered for all pregnant women.  \nIntegrated  management  of  childhood \ncomprehensive coverage is yet not offered countrywide. \nA tuberculosis directly observed therapy program has been introduced, with the \ntuberculosis  notification  rate  at  80%,  and  detection  rate  at  2%.  However,  the \nrates  fluctuate  between  provinces,  and  vary  drastically  over  time,  suggesting \nfurther  investment  required  in  strengthening  the  system.  The  directly  observed \ntherapy program was fully implemented in only 2 western oblasts. \nThe  drug  abuse  and  treatment  program,  targeting  needle  exchange,  was \nestablished in 2001. \nThe  country  still  needs  to  focus  on  many  other  public  health  programs.  Water \nand sanitation coverage is poor. HIV/AIDS national policy is still not developed, \nalthough  in  1998,  the  Government  introduced  the  Republican  HIV/AIDS \nPrevention Center in Tashkent, with branches operating throughout the country.   \nThe  healthy  lifestyle  program  was  introduced  in  1997,  with  functions  to  prevent \nand  help  citizens  quit  smoking,  and  promote  healthy  nutrition  behavior.  The \nInstitute  of  Health  was  established  in  1998,  and  is  expected  to  take  on  the \nresponsibility of health education. \n\n(vii)  MOH is responsible for sanitary and epidemiological services and has stations in \nrural areas. The stations are responsible for health education activities. Reform in \nthe area is slow and inconsistent. \n\n(viii)  The  Family  Planning  program  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Maternal  and  Child \nHealth  (MCH)  Department  within  MOH.  Induced  abortion  is  legal  within  the  first \n12 weeks of pregnancy. \n\n \n12. \nHealth Care Finance. General revenues are the main source of financing Government \nhealth expenditures. After independence, in addition to overall decline in the GDP, public sector \n\n \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nresources for health declined from 4.6% (1995) to 2.7% (2002) of GDP.9 Although public sector \nhealth expenditure has increased in nominal and per capita terms, it has declined both in real \nterms and as a proportion of total government spending (from 10.1% in 1997 to 9.1% in 2002).10 \nPrivate  sector  health  expenditure  share  increased,  (ranging  between  0.6%  [1990]  and  2.6% \n[2002]  of  GDP),  and  contributed  to  about  one-fourth  of  total  health  expenditures  in  2002.  The \nGovernment budget is broken down to four chapters within recurrent expenditures: (i) personnel \nremuneration  and  benefits,  (ii)  medicine,  (iii)  operation  and  maintenance,  and  (iv)  building \nrepairs.  Resources  are  allocated  based  on  inputs,  such  as  beds,  population,  and  staff.  While, \nfunds  for  tertiary  and  specialized  facilities  are  retained  at  the  national  level,  districts  are \nresponsible for investment and maintenance of lower-level facilities. All public sector are on the \nGovernment\u2019s  payroll.  A  physician  receives  approximately  $60\u201380  per  month.  Private \nphysicians are officially permitted to charge user fees. Personnel remuneration as a share of the \nbudget  has  increased  significantly  (from  40%  in  1990  to  63%  in  2002),  while  the  salaries  of \nhealth  providers  remain  among  the  lowest  in  the  country.  In  the  health  sector,  staff-related \nspending  as  a  proportion  of  recurrent  expenditures  accounts  for  more  than  70%  of  spending, \nwhile in primary level facilities the proportion is more than 80%. Assessments show that facilities \nneed renovation, drugs are in short supply, equipment is outdated, and supplies are lacking. \n \n13. \nDespite  the  reform  agenda,  which  aims  at  developing  PHC,  76%  of  the  republican \nbudget and 65% of the local budget go to hospitals (2003). For hospitals, a prospective payment \nmethod  is  used,  based  on  historical  patterns,  and  reimbursements  are  not  adjusted  for  case \nmix.  For  outpatient  services,  a  lump-sum  payment  mechanism  is  used  for  patient  visits. \nHowever, specialized diagnostic tests, such as ultrasound, are paid through direct user charges. \nLittle  information  is  available  to  show  how  much  is  allocated  for  public  health  programs. \nGenerally, PHC services have no formal fees at public sector health facilities. However, informal \npayment for health care is prevalent in Uzbekistan.11 One household survey suggested that 11\u2013\n30% of those seeking medical consultation paid for the services. The poor paid more frequently; \n70%  of  those  among  the  lowest  income  quintile  paid  for  health  care.  In  addition,  the  poorest \nincome quintile reported spending about 22% of household consumption on health care. \n \n14. \nHealth Infrastructure. WCH care has traditionally been located in the secondary health \ncare  facilities.  In  rural  areas,  the  network  of  health  facilities  include  (i) midwifery  clinics  as  the \nfirst  contact  level  with  very  basic  primary  health  care  (PHC);  (ii)  polyclinics  as  the  second \ncontact  with  additional  PHC  services;  and  (iii)  district-hospitals  and  maternity  homes,  which \nprovide basic secondary health care and basic maternity and delivery care. In the urban areas, \npolyclinics are the first level of contact, and provide secondary level of care. The specialists in \npediatrics, obstetrics, internal medicine and dentistry are housed in these polyclinics. The recent \nintroduction of rural doctoral points as the first entry point instead of midwifery clinics will provide \nPHC diagnostics, basic treatment, infectious diseases prevention, and basic reproductive health \ncare.  In  1997,  specialized  hospitals  were  introduced  to  deal  with  tuberculosis  and  sexually \ntransmitted  diseases.  The  Government  set  up  and  strengthened  the  emergency  health  care \nfacilities throughout the country. Tertiary or specialized hospitals are mostly concentrated in the \nurban cities. \n \n \nOver  the  past  decade  the  Government  has  vigorously  pursued  privatization,  although \n15. \ncontinued  effort  is  required.  Several  polyclinics  and  hospitals  were  privatized  by  contracting \nprivate services at public facilities. Private doctors are permitted to charge a fee for service, but \n\n__________________________________ \n9   World Bank. 2004. Public Expenditure Review.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\nmust provide at least 20% of health services within the state system, which is then paid for by \nthe Government. Service quality and fees are not regulated. \n \n16. \nUzbekistan closed many unused hospital beds over the past decade. The country had 6 \nhospital  beds  per  1,000  people  in  2000,  as  compared  with  12  per  1,000  a  decade  ago.  The \nrates are now closer to that of Greece and Italy. Since 1989, several hospital beds were closed \nbecause  of  low  bed  occupancy  rate  and  the  shift  to  day-care  services.  Because  budgets  are \ninput-based,  this  rationalization  has  resulted  in  hospital  budgets  decreasing  by  almost  50%. \nAccording to a simulation, if hospital beds are currently at 165,000, and inpatient admission rate \nis  at  0.13%,  then  the  bed  occupancy  rate  is  at  75%.  According  to  some  reports,  the  bed \noccupancy rate averages about 50\u201360%, and in many hospitals, as few as 20% beds may be \noccupied. Thus several more unused beds could be closed, and perhaps facilities merged, on \nbasis of economies of scale. However, this may be a politically sensitive subject, and unless the \nbudgetary  process  changes  from  input-  to  output  based,  there  will  be  little  incentive  to  close \ndown hospital beds. \n \nHealth Personnel. The country has about three doctors per 1,000 people; less than 1% \n17. \nwork  in  the  private  sector.  Most  physicians  are  specialists;  in  the  former  Soviet  system  little \nemphasis  was  given  to  general  practitioners.  The  doctor-to-population  ratio  in  Uzbekistan  is \nhigher than the average of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2.8), \nwhich  faces  a  higher  burden  of  noncommunicable  diseases  that  require  specialized  care. \nUzbekistan rates are closer to that of Australia and Finland. In 1995, the Government introduced \na licensing system, and only licensed physicians are permitted to practice in the private sector. \nFewer than about 1% of physicians are expected to be in the private sector. The new policy on \nprivatizing  the  provision  of  health  care  and  introducing  fees  for  health  services  raise  greater \nconcerns about equity and access. \n \n18. \nFor the WCH program, the Government employs about 6,000 obstetricians (or 0.24 per \n1,000 population), 20,000 midwives (0.8 per 1,000 population), and 12,000 pediatricians (or 0.5 \nper  1,000  population)  in  2001.  In  1999,  the  Government  created  a  post  of  general  practice \nphysicians for PHC facilities, and offered a program of postgraduate training of general practice \nphysicians  at  medical  schools.  These  physicians  are  supposed  to  work  at  the  rural  doctoral \npoints,  and  provide  preventive  and  basic  curative  health  care  to  all  patients,  including  women \nand  children.  The  specialists,  placed  at  the  secondary  or  rayon  hospitals,  provide  referral \nsupport  for  PHC,  and  conduct  delivery  and  postnatal  care  for  women  and  neonatal  care  for \nchildren.  The  specialists  at  tertiary  or  oblast  hospitals  provide  referral  support  to  secondary \nhealth facilities, and supervise staff in the lower level health facilities. However, supervision of \nrecently trained physicians working in these newly created positions and newly developed rural \ndoctoral  points  is  problematic\u2014their  supervisors  are  specialists  who work  in  the  higher  levels, \nand who have received little training and work in the older less developed health facilities. \n \n19. \nIn addition, Uzbekistan has about 10 nurses per 1,000 population. The average ratio of \nnurse-to-population  in  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  is  about \n7.5.  The  Government  aims  to  keep  the  ratio  of  physicians  to  nurses  at  1  to  7.  To  accomplish \nthis,  they  recently  reduced  the  admission  rates  to  medical  colleges,  and  simultaneously \nincreased the admission rates to nursing colleges. At this point, many nurses are employed in \nthe system; many are redundant. The quality of nursing programs is outdated and is in question. \n \nPharmaceuticals.  Pre-independence,  drug  regulation  and  procurement  system  was \n20. \nunder Moscow\u2019s control. In 1995, MOH set up the Department of Drug and Medical Equipment \nQuality Control. In 1997 the first act on drugs and pharmaceutical activities was developed; the \n\n \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nthrough \n\nnational  drug  policy  was  adopted  in  1999.  The  comprehensive  list  of  drugs  procurement \npermitted  in  the  country  come  to  about  3,500.  The  essential  drug  list  was  introduced  in  1998, \nand includes 240 of these products. Currently, the country is dependent on imported drugs; only \n10%  are  manufactured  locally,  most  are  herbal.  Only  3%  of  drugs  on  the  essential  list  are \ndomestically produced. The public sector supplies 20% of the country\u2019s need. Dori-Dormar, 51% \nstate-owned,  imports  drugs  for  the  public  sector  from  the  newly  independent  states,  and \nUzbekmedexports,  a  parastatal  company,  imports  drugs  for  the  public  sector  from  other \ncountries.12  In  addition,  Medtechnica,  is  the  national  semiautonomous  agency  for  medical \nequipment,  and  Uzmedtekhnika  is  the  main  supplier  of  medical  equipment  from  domestic  and \nimported suppliers. The drugs are in central warehouses and distributed by the state Farmatsija \nsystem \nthrough  sanitary \nthe  regional  divisions.  All  vaccines  are  distributed \nepidemiological  services.  Since  1994,  60%  of  pharmacies  have  been  privatized,  which  means \nthat  all  drugs  for  ambulatory  care  have  copayments,  although  in-patient  care  drugs  are \nsubsidized. MOH subsidizes at least 20 of the most basic drugs on the essential drug list. The \nlicensing committee of MOH certifies pharmacies, distributors, and manufacturers. \n \nHealth  Service  Utilization.  Pre-independence  the  average  length  of hospital stay  was \n21. \nalmost  15  days.  MOH  enforced  regulations  and  reduced  this  to  12  days,  and  for  maternity \ndelivery  to  9  days  (2  days  before  and  7  days  after  delivery).  Additional  rationalization  is \nrequired.  Per  capita  visits  for  outpatients  is  at  about  8  annually,  and  10%  of  patients  receive \nservices from the private sector. The inpatient admission rate was at 0.24%, primarily due to the \ndisproportionate number of specialists in the health care system creating induced demand, and \npoor  quality  of  services  at  the  primary  level  of  health  care.  Through  health  sector  reform \nregulations, and day-care services, inpatient admission has declined to 0.13%. \n \n22. \nPoorer  income  groups  are  less  likely  to  seek  health  care.  Whereas  almost  55% \nindividuals  in  the  highest  income  quartile  sought  health  care,  only  44%  in  the  lowest  income \nquartile sought health care. The higher income groups are more likely to use secondary/tertiary \nhealth  facilities  relative  to  the  lower  income  groups,  who  rely  more  on  outpatient  centers  and \nclinics.  Individuals  from  the  lowest  income  groups  rely  most  heavily  on  PHC  facilities.  The \nhigher income groups are 30\u201350% more likely to go to the central rayon polyclinic or hospital or \nthe  city  polyclinic  or  hospital,  are  more  likely  to  be  admitted  to  hospitals,  and  have  longer \nhospital stays. \n \n\nTable A1.1: Health Statistics on Uzbekistan (1999\u20132002) \n\nRate \n\nSource \n\nIndicators \nEconomy: \nGross domestic product (GDP) per capita, US$ \n \n \n \nGDP Growth Rate  \n \n \n \nUnemployment rate  \n\n \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nInflation Rate  \n \nPopulation Living Below the Poverty Line  \nShare of Poorest Quintile in National Income or Consumption  9.2% \nAid as a Percent of gross national income \n \nHealth Sector: \nHealth expenditure per capita  (current, US$)  \n \nHealth expenditure as % of GDP  \n\n \n \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.6 (1996) \n1.4 (2001) \n\n__________________________________ \n12 European Observatory. 2001.

\n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nA. \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \nThe Government does not have an official \nnational poverty reduction program. \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n    No \n\n \n\n Yes \n \n  No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nprovided  technical  assistance  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive  medium-term  strategy  for \nimproving  living  standards,  built  on  the \nStandards \nWorld \nAssessment.  The \nis \nexpected  to  be  the  basis  for  subsequent \ndialogue with the Government. \n\nresulting  strategy \n\nBank\u2019s \n\nLiving \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan: \nImprovement  in  health  will  have  a  multiplicative  effect  in  reducing  poverty,  improving  learning  and  productivity,  and \nthereby  uplifting  economic  growth.  Health  is  an  important  sector  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  country.  The  Project  will \nimprove the quality of and accessibility to health care, improve health care and health seeking behavior and knowledge \nof the population, and therefore improve the health status of women and children in the country. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA  specific  poverty  analysis  is  not  required.  The  Living  Standards  Assessment  was  conducted  in  2002,  and  the \nDemographic Health Survey will provide results in 2003. These surveys provide data for further analysis in this section.  \nIn  Uzbekistan,  overall,  27%  of  the  population  lives  below  poverty  line,  with  almost  69%  of  the  poor  living  in  rural \nareas.  Past  data  are  not  comparable,  but  the  1996  household  poverty  incidence  is  estimated  at  21%.  The  southern \nregion,  Kashkadarya  and  Sukhandarya,  reported  the  worst  poverty  incidence,  followed  by  the  northern  region, \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm;  together  these  regions  comprise  28%  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  but  over  55%  of  the \nshare of poor and extremely poor. Kashkadarya oblast reported the worst incidence of poverty and extreme poverty in \nthe country.  \n\nPoverty Classification:  Poverty Intervention \n\nSome health indicators are influenced by poverty. Poorer income groups are less likely to seek health care. While \nalmost  55%  of  individuals  in  the  highest  income  quartile  sought  health  care,  only  44%  in  the  lowest  income  quartile \nsought health  care. The higher income  groups are more likely to use secondary/tertiary  health facilities relative to the \nlower income groups, which rely more on outpatient centers and clinics. Individuals from the lowest income groups rely \nmost  heavily  on  primary  health  care  (PHC)  facilities.  The  higher  income  groups  are  30\u201350%  more  likely  to  go  to  the \ncentral raion  polyclinic or hospital or the city polyclinic or hospital, are more likely to be admitted to hospitals, and have \nlonger hospital stays. (Family Income and Expenditure Survey, 1996; World Bank. 2002. Uzbekistan, Living Standards \nAssessment:  Health,  Nutrition,  and  Population.  Washington,  DC;  Cashin,  C.  2001.  Access  to  Health  Care  in  Rural \nFergana Oblast, Uzbekistan. Study prepared by ZdravPlus, USAID, Tashkent). \n        The Project will have a poverty intervention focus. The project sites will be selected using the following criteria: (i) \npoverty profile, (ii) poor maternal mortality and anemia, (iii) poor infant mortality and malnutrition, (iv) high incidence of \ntuberculosis, and (v) poor access to water. Based on these selection criteria, the oblasts of focus have tentatively been \nidentified as Bukhara, Karakalpakstan, Khorezm, Kashkadarya, and Tashkent (does not include Tashkent city). \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nProject preparation included a social analysis, and a participatory beneficiary and stakeholder analysis, to include the \nconcerns  of  local  authorities,  the  Mahallah  Fund  (nongovernment  organization  providing  social  assistance  to \ncommunities),  community-based  organizations,  women\u2019s  groups,  and  citizens).  The  results  were  used  in  the  project \ndesign. \nD.  Gender Development \n\n  Yes \n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n   No \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nCulturally, women may not have an equal status in society. The Project focuses on women by providing education and \ntraining to women\u2014nurses and midwives especially. Beneficiaries are mostly women between the ages of 15\u201349 years \n(55% of all women). \nThe Project will (i) focus on women and children\u2019s health care, (ii) target areas with relatively low maternal mortality ratio \n(MMR), (iii) have a human development focus, and (iv) help upgrade the status and profile of nurses and midwives\u2014\nwho are women health care providers. \nIn general, gender differentials in health outcome are not significant in the country.  Women\u2019s overall health conditions \nin Uzbekistan are relatively better than in other Central Asian countries. However, since 1994, Uzbekistan has not seen \n\n \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nmuch  improvement  in  its  MMR.  In  addition,  in-country  differentials  are  noted.  MMR  in  Bukhara  oblast  is  twice  the \nnational  average.  Anemia  among  pregnant  women  is  highest  in  Karakalpakstan  oblast.  In  addition,  pregnant  women \nfrom rural areas are less likely to visit doctors than nurses, than are women from urban areas.   \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n No \n\nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n \n \nItem \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\nNot required \n\nHave been assessed in social and poverty analyses. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  target  the  poorer  oblasts;  (ii)  have  a  human \ndevelopment focus; (iii) support health financing and management \nreforms;  and  (iv)  assist  the  Government  in  health  personnel \ncareer  development, \nimproving \nperformance of health service providers.  \n\nincentives \n\nincluding \n\nfor \n\nGenerally,  PHC  services  have  no  formal  fees  at  public \nsector health facilities. However, informal payment for health care \nis prevalent in Uzbekistan. One household survey suggested that \n11\u201330%  of  those  seeking  medical  consultation  paid  for  the \nservices. The poor paid more frequently, as 70% of those among \nthe  lowest  income  quintile  paid  for  health  care.  In  addition, \naccording  to  a  household-based  study,  the  poorest  income \nquintile  reported  spending  about  22%  of  household  consumption \non  health  care.  (World  Bank.  2002.  Uzbekistan  Living  Standards \nAssessment: Health, Nutrition, and Population. Washington, DC).  \nNot required. \n\nin \n\nfound \n\nHave been assessed in social and poverty analyses.  \nSeveral  ethnic  groups  are \nthe  country.  Uzbeks \npredominate in the east, Karakalpakstan in the far west, Russians \nlive  primarily  in  and  around  Tashkent.  People  living  in  deserts  in \nthe center and west of the country are most dispersed, and those \nliving in the mountainous regions of Kashkadarya have few good \nroads. Both face great problems reaching sources of health care, \nbut  it  is  distance  and  the  cost  of  transportation,  not  the  fact  that \nthey  are of one or another ethnic group, that is the key factor in, \nfor  example,  higher  rates  of  maternal  mortality  and  general \nmorbidity  in  these  environments.  Russians  living  in  and  around \nTashkent  are,  as  a  group,  wealthier  than  Uzbeks  in  the  same \narea,  but  many  have  lost  jobs  and  find  it  difficult  to  pay  for  the \ngenerally higher priced services of that urban area. Some areas of \nthe country have been resettled under schemes sponsored under \nthe former Soviet Union. Citizens from various ethnic groups have \nbeen  brought  together  in  these  areas  and  been  challenged  to \nlearn  how  to  live  in  close  proximity,  away  from  traditional  areas. \nWe  concluded  that  in  none  of  these  circumstances  is  there \njustification  for  addressing  the  needs  of  any  particular  minority \ngroup.  It  is  therefore  not  appropriate  to  elaborate  an  indigenous \npeoples\u2019 plan for any group in Uzbekistan.     \n\nNot required. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAffordability \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nLabor \n\n Significant \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5   \n\n39\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nPublic  intervention  in  the  health  sector  typically  has  a  number  of  justifications:  public \ngoods, positive externalities, and merit goods. A limited number of health goods are technically \n\u201cpublic\u201d goods,1 where the marginal cost of providing services to an additional person is zero or \nnear zero. Services that have positive externalities2 should generally be provided at low or zero \ncost  to  patients  either  through  direct  service  provision  or  demand-side  subsidies.  Merit  good3 \njustification  is  strengthened  when  technical  information  about  services  is  complex  or  where \nsubstantial  counter-information  pushes  consumers  toward  the  wrong  choices.  This  Project  is \njustified on grounds that it will provide services that have (i) positive externalities, given that it \nwill focus on primary health care (PHC) and will address issues of family planning; and (ii) merit \ngoods as it will directly impact woman and child health (WCH), through antenatal care and care \nof  sick  children,  reduce  unnecessary  use  of  hospitals,  and  provide  better  information  to \nconsumers.  \n \n2. \nFor the economic analysis of the Project, costs (financial and non-financial) and benefits \n(mainly  health)  of  the  Project  are  examined.  These  include  (i)  reduced  travel  time  from \ntreatments PHC facilities; and (ii) reduced opportunity cost of patient care resulting from shorter \nstays  in  hospital.  Computing  these  likely  benefits  has  not  been  possible.  However,  their \ninclusion would improve the following highlighted cost-effectiveness ratios. \n \n3. \nThe key outcomes of interest are the infant mortality rate (IMR) and  maternal mortality \nratio  (MMR).  The  problem  with  MMR  is  that  it  is  such  a  rare  event  that  it  requires  a  large \npopulation just to measure accurately let alone show a significant impact from an intervention.4 \nIn contrast, a much smaller population is required to measure and show a significant effect on \nthe IMR.5 Given this increased reliability we focus on the impact of project inputs on the IMR. \nProcess indicators that are thought to be highly correlated with MMR include skilled attendance \nat birth and improved access to comprehensive obstetric facilities.  \n \n4. \nOfficial figures put the IMR at around 16.5 per 1,000 live births (2002). Reports from both \nthe  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  Demographic  Health  Survey  reports  suggest  that  the \nfigure  is  substantially  higher,  at  between  52  and  62.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  we \nassume the initial national rate is currently 606 and slightly higher in poorer oblasts. Estimates \nsuggest that around 53% of IMR is attributable to the perinatal period (up to 7 days after birth) \nand  the  remaining  share  to  the  period  between  7  and  365  days.  Estimates  made  by  the \npreparation  team  suggest  the  majority  of  mortality  in  the  perinatal  period  is  attributable  to \nasphyxia,  sepsis,  and  prematurity,  while  causes  of  post-perinatal  mortality  are  probably \n\n__________________________________ \n1   A limited number of examples of public goods in the health sector including water supplies and zoonotic control. In \n\nmaternal health there are few if any examples. \n\n2  A rather larger number of health goods exhibit positive externalities whereby the consumption of the service by one \nperson  provides  benefits  to  others  that  are  not  directly  receiving  the  service.  These  services  include  vaccination \nand family planning.  \n\n3   Merit goods are those goods that are undervalued by consumers because technical information on benefits cannot \nbe properly made available and assimilated by consumers. Good examples are formula milk, where the advertising \nof  multinationals  has  led  to  substantial  misinformation  and  confusion  about  the  merits  of  breastfeeding,  and \ndiagnostic services where providers are often able to convince consumers that they require more services than are \nnecessary. \n\n4   Probably over 10,000,000 when the rate is around 50. \n5   When the IMR is around 30 for a population of around 300,000 and when it is 50 of around 120,000. \n6 This baseline figure has the added advantage of being the base estimate for projections of IMR used in World Bank \n\ndemographic projections http://devdata.worldbank.org/hnpstats/files/UZB_pop.xls. \n\n \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nattributable mainly to bacterial infections and diarrhea.

These  assumptions  generate  a  time  series  for  infant  deaths  and  IMR  based  on \nestimates of birth rate and population size. To compute the net impact the calculated difference \nbetween  this  series  and  projections  for  IMR,  are  multiplied  by  the  number  of  projected  infant \n\n__________________________________ \n7   Based on United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimates of infant mortality. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5   \n\n41\n\ndeaths to obtain deaths averted. Years of life gained are computed by multiplying this estimate \nin each year by the discounted life expectancy at year one.  \n \n6. \nMany of these interventions should also reduce infant distress and morbidity and so the \ntotal health benefits, as measured by a composite measure such as disability adjusted life years \n(DALY)  would  be  significantly  greater.  The  years  of  life  gained  figures  are  also  converted  to \nindicate  the  number  of  disability  adjusted  life  years  saved  although  these  are  for  the  mortality \nsavings  only  and  so  are  likely  to  underestimate  the  overall  project  benefit.  Benefits  are \ndiscounted  to  the  present  to  get  a  net  present  value  of  years  of  life  gained  plus  disability \nadjusted life years over 10 and 20 years. Since, the benefits target only the project oblasts, only \nthe cost components attributable to these oblasts are included. This requires apportioning only a \npercentage of the national components, human resource development, and blood banking. \n \n7. \nthree  different  rates.  The  recommended  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  rate  of  12%  is  used,  together  with  a  6%  rate  used  for  many \ninternational  comparisons.  Finally  a  lower  rate  of  3%  is  used  to  discount  benefits.  The \njustification  for  discounting  health  benefits,  when  not  expressed  in  dollar  terms,  is  well \nestablished  in  the  literature  on  the  basis  that  the  value  of  health  effects  grow  over  time  as \nincomes and other factors increase. The United Kingdom\u2019s department of health, for example, \nsuggests that while costs are discounted at 6%, health benefits should be discounted at 3.5%. \nWe use 3% here as this is the rate used in the international calculation of disability adjusted life \nyears.  \n \n\nResults  are  discounted  using \n\nTable A5.2: Cost Per Years of Life Gained and Disability Adjusted Life Years Gained \n\n \n\nDiscount Rates \nBenefits \n3% \n3% \n6% \n12% \n\nCosts \n6% \n12% \n6% \n12% \n\nCost per DALY \n\nCost per YLG \n\n10 years \n $39 \n $26 \n $24 \n $42 \n\n20 years \n $39 \n $20 \n $28 \n $51 \n\n10 years \n $20 \n $13 \n $47 \n $23 \n\n20 years \n $19  \n $10  \n $55  \n $27  \n\nNote: DALY = disability adjusted life years, YLG = years of life gained.                              . \nSource: World Bank. 1999.

The  TA  complements  the  Project  by \nstrengthening  MOH  capacity  to  address  woman  and  child  health  care  service  delivery  more \nefficiently and effectively and to sustain its development. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  TA  has  three  components:  (i)  a  study  to  understand  the  causes  of  child  (under-5 \nyears) mortality, (ii) an optimization exercise to rationalize and integrate the health care delivery \nsystem, and (iii) a strategy to improve information base for quality monitoring.  \n \n3. \nLimited data is available on causes of infant (first year of life) or childhood (years 1\u20135) \nmortality  in  Uzbekistan  and  virtually  all  available  data  is  based  on  passive  reporting  via  the \ndeath  certificate  registration.  Current  data  reports  exaggerated  levels  of  death  due  to  acute \nrespiratory  infection  largely  because  physicians  did  not  know  the  cause  of  death  and  use  this \ncategory as a convenient catchall. Child mortality causes are not well known either because of \ninsufficient  diagnostic  skills  or  testing  facilities,  or  because  health  providers  are  discouraged \nfrom reporting the actual cause. Many underreported neonatal deaths are believed to be due to \nasphyxia  or  prematurity  that  is  misclassified  when  cause  of  death  is  given.  To  date,  little  is \nknown about actual causes of death. The TA will conduct a verbal autopsy study (retrospective \nmortality  cases  will  be  followed  through  to  asses  cause  of  death),  and  the  results  will  help \nidentify  the  true  causes  of  death,  help  gain  information  for  evidence-based  medicine,  and \nidentify training needs for health providers. \n \nA  fundamental  issue  to  be  addressed  in  undertaking  optimization  is  the  change  in  the \n4. \nnumbers  and  mix  of  health  services  and  staff.  While  incentives  provided  through  payment \nsystems  act  to  encourage  efficiency,  a  coordinated  plan  for  human  resources  that  is  not \nconfined to a single facility or area is needed. Up to now human resource planning has occurred \nmainly within rayons, where staff have shifted from hospital to primary care facilities. A variety of \nother options are available to address both excess staffing and lack of the appropriate skill mix \nincluding  early  retirement,  retraining,  redundancy  with  help  in  getting  alternative  employment, \nand  transfer  to  other  institutions.  Developing  oblast  plans  would  be  a  first  stage  to  adopting a \ncoordinated strategy for optimizing services and developing a human resources strategy. These \nplans should be linked to plans for training new medical staff, so that the output of medical and \nnursing colleges is related to the demand for staff within the health system. The TA will conduct \na study on optimization of health services, and on human resources in the health sector. This \nwill help to develop a national strategy for financing a smooth transition from current staffing and \nskill  levels  to  those  required  in  a  more  efficient  system.  The  study  will  analyze  the  expected \nfuture  supply  of  different  types  of  staffing  cadres  and  skills  under  current  levels  of  natural \nattrition and training outputs of medical schools, colleges, and institutes. It will also examine the \ndemand for staffing based on the skills and levels required to deliver good quality woman and \nchild-care  and  other  essential  care  and  other  services,  using  updated  protocols.  Finally,  the \nstrategy  would  examine  how  to  bring  supply  and  demand  for  human  resources  into  balance \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nincluding  investigation  of  geographic  mal-distribution,  retention  of  the  best  staff  through \nincentives, and redundancy issues including costs. \n \n5. \nWhile a lot of information is collected, much of its value is lost because managers do not \nuse it for analysis and decision-making. Throughout Uzbekistan, heads of hospitals, clinics, and \nhealth administration offices are doctors who have been assigned managerial responsibility but \nhave little or no training to help them carry out their duties. Many managers see themselves first \nas  doctors  and  secondly  as  mere  custodians.  Few  see  themselves  as  proactive  decision \nmakers. Recently, in part because of various reform initiatives now under way, managers within \nthe  health  system  are  beginning  to  realize  the  potential  of  information  to  help  them  plan  and \nmanage  their  organizations.  The  TA  will  help  develop  an  information  system  strategy  for  the \nhealth sector, which will provide timely and reliable data. \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n6. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $353,000  equivalent,  of  which  $230,000  is  the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $123,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nasked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  finance  $300,000,  covering  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost of $230,000 and $70,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government \nwill  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff, \noffice  space  and  furniture  for  TA  administration,  workshop  facilities,  and  transport  and \nallowances of government officials. The TA is to be financed by ADB on a grant basis through \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.
