Natural  disasters  causing  1.2  million  tons  shortfall  in  rice \nproduction  adversely  affected  the  food  security  of  25  million \npeople.  Soaring  food  prices,  driven  by  rising  international  prices, \ncompounded  the  food  insecurity  of  millions  of  people.  An \nadditional  12  million  people  have  fallen  below  the  poverty  line \nfollowing the surge in food prices. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  food  security  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  people  in  the  face  of  rising  food  prices.  It  will  provide \nshort-term  transitional  support  to  help  the  Government  meet \nunexpected  high  expenditures  for  safety  net  programs  based  on \nthe  needs  assessment conducted  jointly  with  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) and World Bank with the support \nof  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations \n(FAO),  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  United  States  Agency \nfor \n(USAID),  and  World  Food \nProgramme (WFP).   \n \nThe major outputs of the Project are the following:  \n \n\nInternational  Development \n\n  Output 1:  Strengthened open market sales of food grains, \nwith wider coverage to ensure food security for 1.1 million \nperson-months of targeted poor and vulnerable people.  \n\n  Output  2:  Enhanced  food  entitlements  for  5.4  million \nperson-months  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  to  survive \nshort-term food deficits.  \n\n  Output  3:  Enhanced  purchasing  power  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  by  generating  rural  employment  for  1  million \nperson-months.  \n\n(iv)  Output  4:  A  more  effective  and  efficient  food  security \n\nmonitoring system.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nin  poverty \n\nreduction  and \n\nThe  surge  in  prices  of  food  grains  has  eroded  the  purchasing \npower  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  placing  them  at  great  risk  of \nhunger and malnutrition. Soaring food prices are undermining the \ngains  in  poverty  reduction  and  have  pushed  large  numbers  of \npeople  back  below  the  poverty  line.  An  additional  8.5%  of \nhouseholds  have  fallen  below  the  poverty  line  in  2008\u2014this \ntranslates  into  an  additional  2.5  million  households  or  12  million \npeople.  People  below  the  poverty  line  experienced  income \nerosion  of  36.7%  from  January  2007  to  March  2008  because  of \nhigher  food prices.  In  light  of  these risks,  the  Government  needs \nto  strengthen  safety  net  programs  immediately  for  the  most \nvulnerable  population  to  cope  with  the  drastic  rise  in  their  food \nbills.  The  proposed  support  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall \ncommitment made by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May \n2008  to  provide  urgent  budgetary  support  to  the  hardest  hit \ncountries for safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable in the \nface  of  rising  food  prices.  Those  most  vulnerable  to  food  price \nshocks  need  to  be  protected  from  nutritional  deprivation,  erosion \nin  their  real  purchasing  power,  and  asset  shedding.  Failure  to \nprotect  the  poor  from  income  erosion  could  seriously  undermine \nthe  political  and \nrecent  gains \nmacroeconomic stability of the country.  \n \nThe  overall  policy  and  institutional  environment  is  sound.  The \nGovernment  has  taken  bold  actions  to  reduce  subsidies  by \nsubstantially  raising  fertilizer  and  energy  prices,  with  freed \nresources  exclusively  targeting  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through \nstrengthened  safety  net  programs.  The  Government  has  a  good \nrecord  of  managing  public  food  distribution  through  well-targeted \nand  well-managed  programs,  so  there  is  a  solid  basis  for \nsupporting the envisaged safety net programs. The food for work \nprogram  also  supports  the  construction  and  maintenance  of \nriver  embankments, \nessential \nirrigation, and other public facilities. Only short-term solutions will \nbe  covered  by  the  emergency  loan.  Medium-  and  longer-term \nmeasures  to  ensure  food  security  through  increased  agriculture \nproductivity will be covered under the regular country operational \nprogram  in  support  of  the  national  food  policy  and  the  plan  of \naction for its implementation. \n \nThe  main  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  to  prevent  poverty  from \nrising.  The  Project  will  improve  the  food  security  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  people  affected  by  repeated  natural  disasters  and \nrising \nthe \nGovernment  so  that  5  million  poor  and  vulnerable  people  have \nbetter  access  to  food.  It  will  reduce  the  poverty  levels  of  low-\nincome  groups.  The  focus  of  the  Project  will  be  on  improving \naccess of the poor to food, income, and livelihood support. It will \nassist  in  relieving  the  immediate  fiscal  pressures  caused  by  a \nsharp  rise  in  safety  net  expenditures.  It  will  also  assist  in \nsustaining  the  external  balance,  aggravated  by  higher  import \ncosts for food grains.   \n\ninfrastructure\u2014rural \n\nIt  will  contribute \n\nthe  efforts  of \n\nfood  prices. \n\nroads, \n\nto \n\n\f \nProject Investment Plan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $1,293 million. \n \nThe  Government  has  already  diverted  significant  resources  from \nits  general  development  priorities  to  meet  the  increasing  social \nsafety net requirements. In light of adverse fiscal performance, the \nGovernment  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  concessional  loan \nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  104,247,000  (equivalent  to \n$170 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n  \nThe  World  Bank  is  preparing  parallel  financing  of  the  Project  (in \nan  amount  preliminarily  estimated  at  $100  million)  based  on  the \njoint needs assessment. JBIC and the Islamic Development Bank \nare also considering the possibility of cofinancing the Project with \nADB.  If  all  the  sources  of  external  funding  materialize,  the \nGovernment  will  be  able  to  recoup  a  portion  of  the  safety  net \nthe  ongoing  National  Food  Policy \nexpenditures.  Following \nCapacity  Strengthening  Program,  implemented  by  FAO  and \nfunded  by  the  European  Commission  (EC)  and  USAID,  further \nassistance  is  under  consideration  by  EC  and  USAID  for  about \n$5 million  each  for  food  policy  implementation  and  monitoring, \ncomplementary to ADB assistance.  \n \n31 December 2009 \n \n30 June 2009 \n\n \nFinance Division, Ministry of Finance  \n \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  provide  funds  to  the  Implementing \nAgency, \nthe  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management \n(MoFDM). Overall project coordination will be provided by a food \nsecurity  steering  committee  (FSSC),  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nthe  Finance  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  FSSC  will \ninclude representatives at joint secretary level from the Economic \nRelations  Division  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of \n(MOA),  MoFDM,  Planning  Commission,  and \nAgriculture \nDirectorate of Food and Directorate of Relief and Rehabilitation of \nMoFDM.  The  FSSC  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the \npolicy and governance issues addressed by the Project.   \n \nTo ensure timely implementation of the Project, ADB will delegate \nresponsibility  for  ADB\u2019s  project  administration  to  its  Bangladesh \nResident  Mission,  which  has  extensive  experience \nin \nadministering  similar  projects.  The  resident  mission  will  closely \nmonitor compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements under the Project to \nensure  quality  control  and  accelerated  implementation  through \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks  \n\n \n\ninternational  prices  of \n\nclose  follow-up  and  guidance  to  the  relevant  ministries  and \nagencies on project implementation matters.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  $170  million  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s \nurgent  additional  financing  requirements  for  food  security.  In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy,  the  financing  will  only  be  used  for  expenditures  of  goods \nidentified to implement the Government\u2019s safety net programs and \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  Management  has \nagreed to provide retroactive financing for a maximum 30% of the \ntotal loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred not earlier than \n1  April  2008,  provided  that  the  expenditures  are  in  accordance \nwith agreed procedures, are certified by the Finance Division, and \nthe certification is acceptable to ADB. ADB will reserve the right to \naudit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. \n \nThe Project will provide emergency assistance to the Government \nto  expand  targeted  safety  net  programs  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  at  a  time  when  there  are  inadequate  budgetary \nresources for financing these programs. The Project will assist in \nsustaining  domestic  and  external  balances,  affected  by \nheightened \nfood  grains  and  other \ncommodities.  The  assistance  will  foster  macroeconomic  stability \nby  reducing  the  need  for  domestic  borrowing,  thus  dampening \ninflationary  pressures  and  avoiding  the  crowding  out  of  domestic \ninvestment.  Fiscal  space  will  be  created,  making  it  possible  to \nreallocate  resources  to  other  essential  public  expenditures.  The \nProject  will  help  restore  the  purchasing  power  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  who  are  at  a  greater  risk  of  hunger  and  malnutrition. \nThose most vulnerable to food price shocks will be protected from \nnutritional deprivation, erosion in real income, and asset shedding. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  the  poor\u2014including  men,  women,  and \nchildren\u2014by  enhancing  their  access  to  food,  livelihood  support, \nand employment.  \n \nBecause of the huge volume of emergency food to be distributed, \nthere  are  some  risks  in  the  areas  of  storage  and  distribution, \nleakages,  and  lack  of  financial  accountability  in  safety  net \nprograms.  Over  time,  Bangladesh  has  developed  good  capacity \nand  long  experience  in  managing  public  food  grain  distribution, \nand has strengthened the safeguards necessary to implement the \nsafety  net  and  public  food  distribution  programs  and  systems \neffectively.  Recent  measures,  such  as  the  establishment  of  a \nworking  group  with  donor  participation  to  monitor  the  public  food \nprograms,  will  also  mitigate \nthese  risks.  The  Project  and \nassociated technical assistance (TA) include fiduciary oversight of \nthe components of the funds provided and disbursed for safety net \nspending.  Another  risk  is  the  recurrence  of  natural  disasters  and \nrelated  extensive  damage,  which  would  strain  the  country\u2019s \n\n\fadministrative  capacity  in  distributing  food  and  other  essentials \nand  exert  fresh  pressures  on  the  budget,  involving  additional \nimport  of  these  items.  This  risk  is  addressed  by  adopting \nappropriate  mitigation  and  cost-effective  adaptation  measures \nagainst  floods  and  cyclones,  including  capacity  building,  which \nwould reduce damage from future disasters.  \n \nTA  of  $600,000  for  Strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  Institutional \nCapacity  for  Improving  Food  Security  will  be  provided  to  support \nreform measures and fiduciary oversight supported by the Project, \ncomplementing  ongoing  and  planned  TA  support  by  EC  and \nUSAID  for  food  policy  implementation  and  monitoring.  The  TA \nproject aims to assist in improving the Government\u2019s capacity for \nplanning  and  undertaking  mid-  and  long-term  interventions  to \nimprove  food  security,  including  strengthening    monitoring  for \nincreasing the efficiency of ongoing safety net programs.   \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Food  Security \nProject.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  the \nGovernment\u2019s Institutional Capacity for Improving Food Security, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  world  is  witnessing  a  drastic  rise  in  food  prices.  Soaring  food  prices  have  led  to \nserious hardship for poor and vulnerable people who spend a substantial part of their incomes \non  food.  Food  prices  in  international  and  domestic  markets  have  reached  all-time  highs.  Over \nthe past year, the price of rice in the international market has risen by 196% (from $325 per ton \nin May 2007 to $963 per ton in May 2008).1 Wheat prices in the international market have risen \nby 72% (from $203 per ton in May 2007 to $349 per ton in May 2008). In Bangladesh, the retail \nprice of coarse rice has risen by 61% to Tk32.1 per kilogram (kg) in April 2008 from Tk19.9/kg in \nApril 2007, while the price of wheat has increased by 56% to Tk30.6/kg from Tk19.6/kg over the \nsame period. Despite harvest of a bumper boro rice crop (estimated at 17 million tons), the retail \nprice  of  coarse  rice  further  increased  to  Tk33.4/kg  in  early  July  2008  following  upward \nadjustments in domestic energy and fertilizer prices (Appendix 2). The prices of all other major \nfood commodities have surged in the international and domestic markets.  \n \n3. \nFalling stocks, increased demand, high energy and fertilizer prices, steep depreciation of \nthe  dollar,  and  trade  restrictions  imposed  by  some  countries  have  amplified  the  price  surge  in \nfood  grains.  In  the  face  of  a  shortfall  in  production,  attempts  to  build  stocks  have  heightened \nprice  pressures.  Although  some  of  the  cyclical  factors,  such  as  weather-related  impacts,  are \nlikely to fade, strong structural factors are pushing up food prices and these have some mutually \nreinforcing  effects.  Structural  factors  are  much  more  prominent  in  explaining  the  rise  in  food \ngrain prices. Over the past decades, growth in the production of food grains has failed to keep \npace with growth in consumption, contributing to dwindling global food grain stocks. Growth in \nyields has slowed significantly. The surge in energy prices, driven by structural factors\u2014with the \nresultant rise in prices of fertilizers, irrigation pumps, and transportation costs\u2014has fed into the \nproduction cost, raising food grain prices further. Rapid urbanization and competing demand for \nland  for  commercial  rather  than  agriculture  purposes,  and  growing  scarcity  of  fresh  water  for \nagriculture, have adversely affected production growth. The diversion of cereal use from food to \nproduce biofuel has also contributed to the food crisis. Rising income in emerging countries has \nsteadily  increased  demand  for  food  grain  consumption.  With  higher  income,  the  demand  for \nmeat  and  dairy  products  has  increased.  Production  of  meat  and  dairy  products  requires  large \namounts  of  grain  for  livestock  feed.  In  many  countries,  policy  inadequacies,  weak  institutions, \nand lack of needed investment have inhibited the growth in agriculture production.  \n \n4. \nFood  grain  prices  are  expected  to  moderate  somewhat  eventually  because  of  the \nincreased  supply  response  of  farmers.  However,  the  structural  factors  are  likely  to  dominate \ncyclical  factors\u2014causing  high  prices  to  persist  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Although  the \ninternational prices of many agricultural commodities have started to fall, they are unlikely to fall \n\n                                                 \n1   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 2008. FAO database. Available: www.fao.org. \n\n \n\n\fsignificantly  because  of  several  reasons,  including  the  higher  cost  of  inputs. 2 A  number  of \ndemand factors, such as the need to replenish stocks and expected increases in utilization, are \nkeeping  prices  high  despite  a  favorable  global  production  outlook.  The  most  influential \ndevelopment  in  pushing  up  international  prices  of  basic  foods  has  been  the  low  level  of \nexportable  supplies,  resulting  from  utilization  outstripping  production  for  several  crops  in  a \nnumber of major exporting countries. Rising utilization levels would necessitate more than one \ngood  season  to  bring  about  a  needed  replenishment  of  stocks  and  hence  a  reduction  in  price \nvolatility.   \n \n5. \nThe surge in prices of food grains especially that of rice, has become a matter of serious \nconcern  for  net  food  grain  importing  countries,  such  as,  Bangladesh.  The  erosion  of  the \npurchasing  power  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  places  them  at  greater  risk  of  hunger  and \nmalnutrition. Soaring food prices are undermining the gains in poverty reduction and could push \nlarge  numbers  of  people  back  below  the  poverty  line.  The  Government  needs  to  strengthen \nsafety net programs for the most vulnerable population to cope with the drastic rise in their food \nbills.  Those  most  vulnerable  to  food  price  shocks  need  to  be  protected  from  nutritional \ndeprivation,  erosion  in  their  real  purchasing  power,  and  asset  shedding.  Failure  to  protect  the \npoor from income erosion could seriously undermine recent gains in poverty reduction and the \npolitical  and  macroeconomic  stability  of  the  country  before  the  general  elections  scheduled  in \nDecember 2008.  \n \n6. \nThe  overall  policy  and  institutional  environment  is  sound.  The  Government  has  taken \nbold actions to reduce subsidies by substantially raising fertilizer and energy prices, with freed \nresources  exclusively  targeting  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through  strengthened  safety  net \nprograms.  The  Government  has  a  good  record  of  managing  public  food  distribution  through \nwell-targeted and well-managed programs, so there is a solid basis for supporting the envisaged \nsafety  net  programs.  The  food  for  work  program  also  supports  the  construction  and \nmaintenance  of  essential  infrastructure\u2014rural  roads,  river  embankments,  irrigation,  and  other \npublic facilities. \n  \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1.  Food Price Shocks \n\n  \n7. \nIn Bangladesh, a net food importing country, domestic food grain production, public and \nprivate  stocks,  and  international  trade  determine  food  grain  availability.  Bangladesh  has  been \nseriously  affected  by  food  price  shocks,  driven  by  soaring  international  prices  and  domestic \nproduction shortfall following successive natural disasters. Surging food prices have hit the poor \nand food-insecure households the hardest. The net food buyers3 in rural Bangladesh and fixed \nincome groups in urban areas (including urban slum dwellers)\u2014which represent the majority of \npoor households\u2014are adversely affected. Adjustments in the rural economy, which can create \nnew income opportunities, would take time to reach the poor. The nutrition of the poor is also at \nrisk  when  they  are  not  insulated  from  price  rises.  Higher  food  prices  lead  poor  people  to  limit \ntheir  food  consumption  and  shift  to  less  balanced  diets,  causing  widespread  nutritional \ndeprivation. \n \n8. \nBangladesh  is  still  a  least  developed  country  with  per  capita  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  of  $554  in  FY2008.  However,  over  the  past  three  decades,  it  has  achieved  near  self-\n\n                                                 \n2   FAO. 2008. Food Outlook.  Available: www.fao.org. \n3    Rural households who buy more food than they sell.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fsufficiency in rice production from a chronic food deficit. The significant rise in rice production is \ndue  to  policy  improvement,  which  induced  significant  increases  in  irrigated  areas.  Since \nFY2000, annual food grain production in the country rose by 2.9% or 0.7 million tons. Per capita \nfood  grain  production  has  grown  at  the  comfortable  rate  of  1.3%  per  year  and  availability  has \nrisen  by  2%  annually.  Food  security  remains  elusive,  though,  particularly  in  years  when \nproduction is affected by natural disasters. The devastating floods during July\u2013September 2007 \nand a cyclone during 15\u201316 November 2007, affecting 25 million people in 51 districts, caused \nsevere damage to agriculture, livelihoods, and infrastructure. The combined losses of the floods \nand  cyclone  are  estimated  at  $2.8  billion  or  3.6%  of  GDP.  The  severe  flooding  and  cyclone \nseriously  affected  the  aman  rice  crop;  production  is  estimated  at  9.7  million  tons  in  FY2008, \nwhich  is  1.2  million  tons  lower  than  the  preceding  year.  Although  larger  imports  in  FY2008 \nhelped offset the food grain production shortfall, prices in the domestic market soared because \nof rising international prices and seasonality reinforced by the floods and cyclone. The market \nsurplus of available food grains4 is estimated at 3.9 million tons in FY2008, higher than in recent \nyears  (Appendix  2).  However,  availability  of  food  in  aggregate  terms  does  not  guarantee  food \nsecurity for all at the current level of prices\u2014especially not for the poor and vulnerable.  \n \n9. \nThe  Government  discontinued  administrative  actions,  such  as  anti-hoarding  measures \nthat failed to arrest upward trends in prices. The domestic cost of rice production has increased, \neven with subsidized agriculture inputs such as diesel and urea fertilizer. Responding to market \nsignals, driven by soaring international and domestic prices, the Government fixed the boro rice \nprocurement  price  at  Tk28/kg,  56%  higher  than  the  last  boro  season.  Boro  procurement  runs \nfrom 16 April to 31 August 2008. Even after a bumper boro crop, rice prices did not moderate, \nimplying  that  high  food prices  are  likely  to  persist  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Despite  a  bumper \nboro crop, a supply shortage is possible if the next aman or boro crops are affected by natural \ndisasters  or  other  factors.  Considering  such  risks,  the  Government  is  planning  to  raise  the \nstocks  under  the  public  food  distribution  system  (PFDS)  to  1  million  tons  by  the  end  of  June \n2009 (from 0.6 million tons at the end of June 2008) through domestic procurement and imports \nfor  distribution  to  priced  and  non-priced  safety  net  programs  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The \nboro  procurement  target  of  the  current  season  is  about  1.2  million  tons  (in  terms  of  rice \nequivalent), which is about 50% higher than average boro procurement in the last 5 years and \n7% of expected boro rice production of the current fiscal year. The budgetary implication for this \nprocurement  is  $490  million.  For  the  operation  of  the  PFDS,  public  commercial  imports  in \nFY2009  are  expected  to  rise  to  1.3  million  tons  or  $620 million  from  an  estimated  0.7  million \ntons or $290 million in FY2008 (Appendix 3). The readily available and useable storage capacity \nin the public food grain distribution system is 1.2 million tons, unable to accommodate peak time \nstorage demands. The Government is planning to expand the storage capacity in the PFDS with \na focus on public-private partnership in building and maintaining food grain storage.  \n \n\nPoverty and Macroeconomic Impacts  \n\n2. \n \n10. \nRepeated natural disasters and soaring food prices seriously affected Bangladesh, with \nsignificant  poverty  and  macroeconomic  implications.  Impacts  of  the  rise  of  food  prices  on  the \nhousehold  incomes  and  key  macroeconomic  variables  are  assessed  using  a  computable \n\n                                                 \n4   Market food grains availability in Bangladesh may be defined as follows: \n \n\nFA=NP+OT+PI-DP \nwhere  FA  =  market  food  grains  availability;  NP  =  net  production  (0.9  \u00d7  domestic  gross  production);  \nOT  =  government  off-take;  PI  =  private  imports;  and  DP  =  government  domestic  procurement.  This  definition \nincludes  stocks  held  by  private  traders  that  may  not  reflect  immediate  availability  for  consumption.  Data  on \nprivate food grain stocks are not available.    \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fgeneral  equilibrium  model. 5  The  model  is  calibrated  to  a  social  accounting  matrix  for \nBangladesh for 2005. Two simulations are carried out: one for a 20% rise in the price of food \nitems, and the other for a 60% rise. A rise in food price transmits to the domestic economy by \naffecting  general  prices,  real  wages,  aggregate demand,  supply,  and  real  income. The  results \nshow that the inflation is highly sensitive to a rise in food prices; and a rise in food prices causes \na decline in real household income, household welfare, and real GDP (Table 1). \n\n \nTable 1: Impact of Food Price Rise \n \nSimulation of 60% Rise \n\nItem \nGeneral Price Level \nReal Household Income  \nWelfare (equivalent variation) \nReal GDP \n\n2.16 percentage points \n\n\u20131.612 \n\u20130.905 \n\u20130.787 percentage points \n\nSimulation of 20% Rise \n0.59 percentage points \n\n\u20130.501 \n\u20130.314 \n\u20130.231 percentage points \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, Dhaka Secretariat. \n \nPoverty  Impact.  The  surge  in  prices  of  food,  mainly  rice,  has  seriously  eroded  the \n11. \npurchasing capacity of people living below the poverty line as well as government employees, \nindustrial  workers,  and  others  with  fixed  incomes.  Rice  contributes  to  71%  of  the  total  calorie \nintake/person/day in rural Bangladesh and 60% in urban areas.6 Food accounts for 69% of total \nexpenditures for the poorest 30%. Both urban and rural households in Bangladesh face welfare \nlosses in the short term, even with a 10% increase in the price of rice.7 The losses are higher in \nthe  lower  quintiles.  Households  in  the  poorest  rural  quintile  earn  on  average  63%  of  their \nincome from on- and off-farm wages. The majority of the rural households are net food buyers; \nonly  12%  are  net  food  sellers.  These  characteristics  show  that  the  poorest  households  are \nhighly vulnerable to food price increases and experience large welfare losses. Marginal farmers \nand sharecroppers did not get their due share of the price rise because many of them sold their \ncrops to the landowners at a lower price before the harvest. \n \nHigh  food  inflation  has  two  important  implications  for  the  poor.  First,  it  increases  the \n12. \nprice  of  food  relative  to  that  of  non-food  items.  Since  a  higher  proportion  of  the  consumption \nbasket of the poor in Bangladesh is allocated to food items, the poor have serious difficulty in \nallocating funds in response to food price shocks. Therefore, the poor bear almost the full brunt \nof food inflation. Second, since food inflation reduces the real income of the poor, there is less \nmoney  left  after  food  purchases  to  consume  other  necessary  goods  and  services  such  as \neducation, health, water, sanitation, and energy. In other words, the income effect hurts the poor \nmore.  \n  \n13. \nIn Bangladesh, where about 40% of population is under the upper poverty line and 25% \nis below the lower poverty line,8 a 50% rise in rice prices would reduce the intake of the hard-\ncore  poor  significantly\u2014close  to  a  starvation  diet.  According  to  the  preliminary  findings  of  a \nrecent study,9 considering the weighted inflationary impact of price of rice, an additional 8.5% of \n                                                 \n5   Developed and maintained by the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, Dhaka Secretariat. \n6   Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2005.

Bangladesh  Economy  in  FY2008,  An  Interim  Review  of  Macroeconomic \nPerformance. Dhaka. The survey takes the household income and expenditure survey 2005 data as a reference \npoint.  The  World  Bank  is  currently  preparing  a  poverty  assessment  for  Bangladesh  which  will  include \ncomprehensive analysis of impact of recent rise in food prices on poverty.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fhouseholds  have  fallen  below  the  poverty  line  in  2008.  This  translates  into  an  additional  2.5 \nmillion households or 12 million people falling below the poverty line. The study also reveals that \nthe  heightened  inflation,  particularly  soaring  food  prices,  seriously  affected  the  poor  and \nvulnerable and fixed income earners. People below the poverty line experienced income erosion \nof 36.7% from January 2007 to March 2008.  \n  \n14.  Macroeconomic Impact. The immediate effect of rising food prices is on inflation, fiscal \noutlays,  and  external  balance.  The  surge  in  food  prices  (58.8%  weight  in  the  consumer  price \nindex)  is  pushing  inflation  higher.  Consumer  price  index  inflation  rose  to  10%  on  an  annual \nbasis in March 2008, up from 7% in March 2007. During this period, food inflation rose to 11.8% \nfrom 8%. For FY2008, the fiscal implications of the Government\u2019s response to food price shocks \nand  natural  disasters  are  sizeable  (e.g.,  food  safety  net  spending  of  $0.69 billion  or  0.9%  of \nGDP)  and  subsidies  on  fertilizer  ($0.50  billion  or  0.6%  of  GDP)  and  energy  ($0.84  billion  or \n1.1% of GDP). The fiscal deficit in FY2008 is estimated at 4.7% of GDP (foreign financing 2.4% \nof GDP), from 3.2% of GDP (foreign financing 1.2% of GDP) in the preceding year. The fiscal \npressures  will  be  heightened  in  FY2009  because  of  an  expanded  food  safety  net  program  for \nthe  poor  (1.5%  of  GDP)  and  a  continued  uptrend  in  international  prices  of  fuel  and  fertilizers \n(Appendix 4).  \n \n15. \nConsidering the fiscal pressures of low administered prices of energy and fertilizers, the \nGovernment increased the price of domestic compressed natural gas by 98% at the end of April \n2008. It also increased the price of urea by 108% effective 10 June 2008, and raised fuel prices \nby  34%\u201350%  effective  1  July  2008.  Following  these  price  adjustments,  freed  resources  will \nexclusively target the poor and vulnerable through a strengthened safety net program. Although \nthese adjustments in prices of energy and fertilizers will substantially reduce subsidies, the fiscal \ndeficit  is  projected  to  rise  to  4.9%  of  GDP  in  FY2009  as  international  prices  of  energy  and \nfertilizer  continue  to  rise.  To  finance  the  rising  fiscal  deficit,  the  Government  is  mobilizing \nadditional external assistance to avoid excessive domestic bank borrowing, which is expensive \nand inflationary and crowds out the private sector. Higher food prices significantly contributed to \na  surge  in  the  trade  deficit  (estimated  at  6.8%  of  GDP  in  FY2008).  However,  the  balance  of \npayment impact of higher food prices has been partly offset by higher aid flows and a surge in \noverseas workers\u2019 remittances.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Strategy and Response to Address Food Security \n\n \nIn  2006,  the  Government  approved  the  national  food  policy, 10 which  details  the  key \n16. \nelements of national food security initiatives through (i) adequate and stable supply of food; (ii) \npeople\u2019s  increased  purchasing  power  and  access  to  food;  and  (iii)  adequate  nutrition  for  all, \nincluding women and children. The national food policy emphasizes both short-term solutions to \ncope  with  unexpected  domestic  and  external  shocks  following  natural  disasters,  and  medium- \nand  longer-term  measures  to  ensure  food  security  through  increased  agriculture  productivity. \nWhile  short-term  responses  are  urgently  needed  to  meet  present  food  security  needs  in  the \naftermath of the natural disasters in late 2007 and in the face of rising international prices, over \nthe  medium  to  long  term,  measures  are  needed  to  ensure  continued  availability  of  food.  The \nimmediate  priority  is  to  ensure  food  security  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  In  addition,  farmers\u2019 \nproduction  incentives  will  be  sustained  in  the  immediate  term.  The  coverage  of  safety  net \nprograms  will  be  expanded  to  those  whose  food  security  status  has  been  affected  by  soaring \nprices.  The  Government  aims  to  improve  targeting,  make  delivery  mechanisms  more  cost-\n\n                                                 \n10   Ministry of Food and Disaster Management. 2006. National Food Policy. Dhaka (14 August). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\feffective  and  transparent,  and  reduce  leakage  and  administrative  hurdles  in  the  food  security \nsystem. It also plans to strengthen food stock management by involving the private sector.  \n \n17. \nIn the medium term, food security will be enhanced primarily through technology-driven \nproductivity improvements rather than by the provision of government subsidies. The focus will \nbe on technological improvement, boosting investment in agriculture, adoption of higher yielding \ncrop  varieties,  and  strengthening  the  agro-input  distribution  system  (quality  seeds,  fertilizers, \nwater  and  irrigation  costs,  credit,  etc.).  With  support  of  the  development  partners,  the \nGovernment recently developed a plan of action for implementing the national food policy with \n26  areas  of  intervention  and  314  targeted  actions  (Appendix  5).  The  plan  is  expected  to  be \napproved within 2008 and implementation commenced. The Government is aware of the large \ninvestment  needs  in  agriculture,  particularly  the  food  grain  subsector.  It  considers  that  its \ncooperation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the agriculture sector should prioritize \nfood  crop  production,  seed  development  and  agricultural  research,  extension,  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and support services.  \n\n \nFollowing  successive  natural  disasters  in  the  second  half  of  2007  and  in  the  face  of \n18. \nrising  international  prices,  the  Government  responded  to  soaring  food  grain  prices  in  several \nways, including cutting the import duty on food items, raising food grain imports, launching an \nextensive  flood  and  cyclone  recovery  program,  focusing  on  higher  boro  rice  production,  and \nwidening  social  safety  net  programs  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  It  banned  the  export  of \nnonaromatic varieties of rice for 6 months and negotiated to import a substantial quantity of rice \n(500,000 tons) from India. Bangladesh Bank is following a more flexible approach in exchange \nrate management to contain the pass-through of rising international prices to domestic prices. It \nis encouraging banks to provide credit facilities on softer terms to new importers, easing letter of \ncredit margins for food items, and extending the time limit for importers. The Government has \ntaken  bold  actions  to  reduce  subsidies  by  substantially  raising  fertilizer  and  energy  prices; \nresources freed from these actions exclusively fund additional safety net programs. However, it \nis not possible for the Government to address such a severe crisis from its own resources, so it \nhas requested the development partners to fund the substantial financing gap.    \n \n19. \nIn  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation  (JBIC)  and  World  Bank\u2014supported  by  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization \n(FAO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID)  and  World  Food  Programme  (WFP)\u2014conducted  the  needs  assessment  to  determine \nthe country\u2019s immediate safety net requirements, evaluate its program,  and agree on areas of \nassistance  to  be  provided  by  the  development  partners  with  the  concurrence  of  the \nGovernment.  ADB\u2019s  emergency  assistance  will  focus  on  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  food \nsafety net programs.  \n \n\n4.  Needs Assessment  \n \n20. \nThe needs assessment mission conducted jointly with the JBIC and World Bank with the \nsupport of FAO, IMF, USAID, and WFP focused on immediate assistance measures needed by \nthe Government in the face of food price shocks. The findings of the needs assessment mission \nare as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nFollowing the national food policy, the policy measures available in the short run \ninclude  expanding  safety  net  programs  and  social  protection  for  the  vulnerable \nand  poor  affected  by  unexpected  domestic  and  external  shocks,  such  as  in  the \naftermath  of  natural  disasters  and  rising  food  prices.  Several  priced  and  non-\n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\npriced safety net programs under the PFDS can support the purchasing power of \nthe poor without distorting incentives for domestic food production (Appendix 6).  \nSafety  net  programs  related  to  food  security  include  open  market  sales, \nvulnerable  group  development,  vulnerable  group  feeding,  test  relief  (food),  food \nassistance,  and  food  for  work.  These  safety  net  programs  are  targeted  on  the \nbasis of low income groups and poverty concentration areas. The Government is \nplanning  to  strengthen  these  safety  net  programs  further,  with  an  emphasis  on \ntargeting efficiency in addition to increased spending and expanded coverage, to \nprotect  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  the  food  price  shocks.  The  channel-wise \nfood  distribution  under  the  expanded  safety  net  program  compared  to  earlier \nyears is given in Appendix 7. \nLearning  from  the  experience  of  neighboring  countries  (e.g.,  India),  the \nGovernment  has  introduced  a  new  100-day  employment  scheme  for  8  million \nperson-months  or  2  million  beneficiaries  to  address  joblessness  in  poverty-\nstricken  rural  areas.  The  sustainability  and  effectiveness  of  the  scheme  will  be \nreviewed by independent research agencies.  \nThe  Government  will  need  to  increase  safety  net  program  spending  for  food \nsecurity in FY2009 to $1.29 billion or 1.45% of GDP from $0.69 billion or 0.88% \nof  GDP  in  FY2008  (Table  2).  Expanded  safety  net  programs  are  needed  to \nprovide income, food, and livelihood support to the poor and vulnerable for 58.41 \nmillion  person-months  in  FY2009  from  43.70  million  person-months  in  FY2008, \nincreasing coverage by 34%.  \n\n \n\nTable 2: Social Safety Net for Food Security \n \n\n \n \nSafety Net Program \n \n \n\n \nOpen Market Sales \n\nCoverage \n(million person-\nmonths) \n \n\nFY2008 \nFY2009 \nFY2008 \nEstimate Budget  Estimate \n \n8.50 \n\n \n269.53 \n\n \n6.84 \n\nVulnerable Group Development \n\n8.83 \n\n8.83 \n\n105.10 \n\nVulnerable Group Feeding \n\n20.93 \n\n22.50 \n\n124.64 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n\n% of \nGDP \n \n0.35 \n\n0.13 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.03 \n\nFY2009 \nBudget \n \n389.93 \n\n121.96 \n\n103.22 \n\n92.05 \n\n29.36 \n\n% of \nGDP \n \n0.44 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.03 \n\nTest Relief (Food) \n\nGratuitous Relief (Food) \n\nFood Assistance in Chittagong \nHill Tracts \n\n \n\nFood for Work Program \n\n100-Day Employment Scheme \n\n1.43 \n\n3.20 \n\n0.71 \n\n1.76 \n\n0.00 \n\n1.91 \n\n3.20 \n\n59.91 \n\n25.36 \n\n0.71 \n\n29.74 \n\n0.04 \n\n34.68 \n\n0.04 \n\n4.76 \n\n8.00 \n\n73.32 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.00 \n\n229.98 \n\n291.55 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.33 \n\nTotal \n\n43.70 \n\n58.41 \n\n687.60 \n\n0.88 \n\n1,292.73 \n\n1.45 \n\nFY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on Finance Division data. \n\n  \n21. \nThe  safety  net  programs  in  Bangladesh  have  been  evaluated  by  several  key \ndevelopment  partners  including  International  Food  Policy  Research  Institute,  WFP,  and  World \nBank in addition to regular monitoring and evaluation by relevant government agencies. Since \nthe early 1970s, safety net programs have had a tremendous impact on the improvement in the \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\noverall food security and nutrition status of the poorest people in Bangladesh. These programs \nhave  helped  the  poor  and  vulnerable  to  improve  their  livelihoods;  health  and  nutrition  status, \nparticularly  for  women  and  children;  and  income  generation.  Women  have  become  more \nempowered and their ability to make decisions, mobilize resources, and exercise choices over \nvarious aspects of their lives has improved. Income transfers from the safety net programs have \nalso  played  an  important  role  in  protecting  and  expanding  the  asset  bases  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable.  The  programs  have  made  major  contributions  toward  reduction  of  the  national \npoverty  level,  by  protecting  against  a  worsening  hunger  situation  and  avoiding  a  major \njoblessness  situation.  They  have  also  played  a  key  role  in  developing  and  improving  the \ncountry\u2019s infrastructure, including rural roads, flood protection, and irrigation facilities (especially \nthrough  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  embankments  and  channels  by  low-income \ncommunities).  Based  on  recent  evaluations,  these  programs  are  particularly  beneficial  for  the \npoor and vulnerable at times of natural disasters and food insecurity. Among the different forms \nof  transfer,  the  biggest  improvement  is  in  food  security  of  the  extreme  poor.  Considering \nBangladesh\u2019s  level  of  income  and  size  of  population,  these  programs  are  limited  in  scale  and \ncoverage. Their efficiency, in terms of targeting and coverage, needs to be improved; and their \nadministrative  capacity  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  enhance  their  quality  and  effectiveness \n(Appendix 8).  \n \n\n5.  ADB's Assistance to Address Food Security \n\n \n22. \nADB  supported  policy  reforms  and  innovative  interventions  for  increasing  food  grain \nproduction, agriculture inputs liberalization, agribusiness, diversifying crops, and developing the \nlivestock and fisheries sectors. ADB has also assisted in conserving the environment, creating \nand  developing  irrigation  systems,  fostering  small-scale  water  resources,  building  flood \nprotection, and ensuring greater access to markets for villagers. This support has made a major \ncontribution  to  raise  agriculture  productivity  over  recent  decades.11 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh  for  2006\u20132010 12 \u2014jointly  developed  with  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID),  Government  of  Japan,  and  World  Bank\u2014\nemphasizes  (i)  intensification,  diversification,  and  value  addition  of  crops  to  boost  agricultural \nproductivity,  improve  food  security,  and  foster  rural  nonfarm  enterprise  development;  (ii) \nstrengthened farm-to-market linkages; and (iii) sustained growth of agriculture and agribusiness \nto generate productive on- and off-farm employment to raise rural income.  \n \n23. \nConsistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  and  complementing  support  by  other \ndevelopment partners, ADB assistance to Bangladesh in the agriculture sector over the medium \nto  long  term  will  continue  to  focus  on  expanding  access  to  irrigation  and  associated  flood \nprotection  through  increased  support  in  both  large-  and  small-scale  water  resources \nmanagement;  and  on  improving  rural  infrastructure  and  raising  agriculture  productivity.  In \naddition  to  its  ongoing  support  for  intensification,  diversification,  and  production  of  high  value \ncrops, ADB will intensify its assistance in capacity development, research, extension, and field \nlevel support services aimed at raising food production. To this end, ADB will refocus the Crop \nDiversification Project II planned for 2010 toward production of staple food crops. ADB will also \nenhance  its  support  in  developing  and  adapting  productivity  enhancing  technologies  and \nstrengthening farm-to-market linkages\u2014complementing ongoing and planned assistance in the \nagriculture sector (Appendix 9).  \n \n\n                                                 \n11      ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n\fAs a regional multilateral development bank, ADB responded quickly to address the food \n24. \ncrisis  in  Asia  and  Pacific  countries,  including  Bangladesh,  by  allocating  $500  million  in  urgent \nbudgetary support to the hardest hit countries for safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable \nin the face of rising food prices. It formed a task force, which prepared a comprehensive report \nto address the crisis in its member countries. In response to the Government\u2019s request, a needs \nassessment  mission  was  fielded  from  27  May  to  15  June  2008  to  develop  the  emergency \nassistance needed  for  food  security  in  Bangladesh,  jointly  with  JBIC  and  World  Bank  with  the \nsupport of FAO, IMF, USAID, and WFP. The mission held discussions with the Government on \nkey issues relating to safety net programs, subsidies, and macroeconomic implications over the \nshort, medium, and longer term. \n \n25. \nSubsidies  for  fuel  and  fertilizer  are  increasingly  becoming  unsustainable  because  of \nrising international prices. The recent upward revisions in energy and fertilizer prices are timely \nand will contribute to containing the fiscal deficit in FY2009. Under the Project, the Government \nwill  further  review  options,  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  to \naddress the sustainability of various subsidies affecting the agriculture sector. The Government \nenvisions a phased move to more sustainable pricing, but an immediate increase to world price \nlevels would be too disruptive. In close coordination with other development partners, ADB will \ncontinue  to  support  the  various  policy  reforms  to  reduce  subsidies  on  energy  and  agriculture \ninputs to sustainable levels under its ongoing and planned projects/programs for Bangladesh.  \n  \n\n6.  Response by other Development Partners \n\n \n26. \nFood  security  assistance  from  multilateral  agencies  mainly  focuses  on  budgetary \nsupport  for  implementing  government  safety  net  programs.  Support  from  bilateral  and  UN \nagencies  have  focused  on  food  procurement  and  distribution  through  a  well-coordinated \napproach.  In  FY2008,  funding  has  been  secured  from  development  partners  for  relief  and \nreconstruction  following  natural  disasters,  including  transitional  support  credit  from  the  World \nBank and balance of payments support from IMF. Responding to the food crisis, the World Bank \nis preparing budgetary support for the Government based on the joint needs assessment with \nADB and JBIC parallel to ADB\u2019s emergency assistance loan. JBIC and the Islamic Development \nBank  are  considering  cofinancing  the  Project  with  ADB.  Following  the  ongoing  National  Food \nPolicy  Capacity  Strengthening  Program,  implemented  by  FAO  and  funded  by  EC  and  USAID, \nEC  and  USAID  are  considering  further  assistance  of  about  $5  million  each  for  food  policy \nimplementation  and  monitoring,  complementary  to  ADB  assistance.  DFID  is  initiating  a \ncomprehensive  study  on  the  food  crisis.  EC  is  also  working  on  a  global  response  strategy \ncomprising  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  measures  at  the  country  levels,  which  will  cover \nBangladesh.  In  the  meantime,  USAID  will  continue  funding  the  Jiban  O  Jibika  (life  and \nlivelihood) and  Shouhardo (friendship) programs aimed at improving the use of technology for \nincreasing crop productivity. USAID is also contributing $40 million of food aid to Bangladesh\u2014\n$30 million  will  be  distributed  over  3  years  for  the  school  feeding  program  and  $10  million  is \nemergency  food  aid;  this  follows  $20  million  in  emergency  food  assistance  after  the  2007 \ncyclone.  In  addition  to  its  earlier  contribution  of  A$9.5  million  for  communities  affected  by  the \n2007 cyclone, the Government of Australia will provide A$1.2 million in humanitarian assistance \nto  meet  the  essential  needs,  including  for  food,  of  the  vulnerable  communities  in  Bangladesh. \nDanish International Development Agency (DANIDA) is also stepping up support for integrated \nagricultural development, for enhancing food production. \n  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n7.  Portfolio Restructuring \n\n \n27. \nIn formulating the proposed emergency food assistance, the possibility of loan portfolio \nrestructuring and potential use of Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan savings under ongoing \nprojects  were  carefully  assessed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  disaster  and  emergency \nassistance. 13  The  portfolio  assessment  was  made  as  part  of  the  comprehensive  country \nportfolio  review  in  2008 14  and  regular  project  reviews  in  close  consultation  with  relevant \ngovernment agencies. Over the past 5 years, ADB has emphasized regular portfolio review to \nidentify  and  cancel  ADF  loan  savings,  by  examining  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of \nongoing  projects  and  adjusting  their  scope  and  design.  During  2007,  a  total  of  $157  million  in \nADF loan savings were cancelled.15 As a result, the scope for identifying additional loan savings \nby restructuring the ongoing portfolio became limited. However, after careful review and detailed \nconsultations  with  relevant  executing  agencies  (EAs),  further  loan  savings  of  $46  million  were \nidentified  during  the  2008  country  portfolio  review  from  eight  loans  for  cancellation  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s request.  \n \n\n8.  Governance and Corruption \n \n28. \nDespite  efforts  by  successive  governments,  weak  governance  was  a  key  challenge  in \nBangladesh  until  the  current  caretaker  Government  was  installed  in  January  2007.  The \nGovernment  has  accomplished  some  critical  governance  reforms  during  the  last  18  months, \nwhich  include  (i)  reconstitution  and  operationalization  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission, \n(ii) ratification  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  against  Corruption,  (iii)  submission  of  asset \ndeclarations by members of the civil service, (iv) making the judiciary independent by separating \nit  from  the  executive,  and  (v)  reconstitution  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  and  revision  of \ncivil  service  recruitment  rules  to  ensure  merit  and  transparency  in  the  civil  service  selection \nprocess.  The  Government  is  expected  to  enact  a  law  soon  on  the  right  to  information  to \nenhance  transparency,  accountability,  and  public  sector  responsiveness  and  efficiency.  ADB \nhas been supporting the Government in implementing most of these critical governance reforms \nunder  the  Bangladesh  Good  Governance  Program. 16  The  Government  is  also  preparing  a \ncomprehensive  National  Integrity  Strategy  with  ADB  assistance  to  address  corruption \nholistically. 17 These governance reforms are expected to reinforce the Government\u2019s efforts to \ncurb public sector corruption effectively.   \n \n29. \nPublic procurement, generally associated with a high level of corruption, is undergoing a \nmajor  reform  program  supported  by  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners \nfollowing  new  public  procurement  regulations  that  became  effective  in  October  2003.  To \nenhance  transparency,  the  Government  made  the  Public  Procurement  Act  effective  from \n31 January 2008. At the sector level, the Government has appointed a focal point in each line \nministry,  including  the  MoFDM,  to  address  public  complaints  and  establish  an  effective \ngrievance handling mechanism in all public sector agencies. MoFDM is among the 16 Medium \n                                                 \n13   ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.

An  integrated  budgeting  and  accounting  system  has  been  developed  to  facilitate \nthe centralization of all accounting data from districts and ministries. Strengthening of financial \nmanagement  and  auditing  has  also  been  aided  by  training  provided  under  ADB  TA  to  the \nForeign Aided Projects Audit Directorate (FAPAD) of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor \nGeneral of Bangladesh.18  \n \n30.  MoFDM has a well-functioning and reliable monitoring system to ensure transparency in \nthe procurement and distribution of food grains (the PFDS). The food planning and monitoring \nunit under MoFDM provides a daily countrywide report on the PFDS by collecting data from food \nsilos,  ports,  and  other  food  warehouses  located  at  the  district  and  subdistrict  level.  The \nDirectorate  of  Food  also  has  an  internal  audit  unit,  reporting  directly  to  its  director  general,  to \nconduct  concurrent  and  post-audit  of  all  transactions  in  the  directorate.  The  proposed  Project \nand  attached  TA  incorporate  several  measures  to  help  further  enhance  efficiency  and \ntransparency  in  food  procurement  and  distribution\u2014including  (i)  provisions  for  strict  financial \nmanagement  with  strengthened  government  accounting,  auditing,  and  special  audit  as  part  of \nFAPAD auditing, supported by the TA consultants; (ii) strengthened capacity of the internal audit \nunit;  (iii)  establishing  a  computerized  network  with  the  silos,  ports,  and  district  level  food \nwarehouses;  (iv)  strengthened  government  monitoring  and  strong  project  supervision  of  the \nsafety net programs; and (v) independent spot checks by ADB staff and the TA consultants.  \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThe  main  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  to  prevent  poverty  from  rising.  The  Project  will \nimprove the food security of poor and vulnerable people affected by repeated natural disasters \nand  rising  food  prices.  It  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  so  that  5  million  poor  and \nvulnerable  people  have  better  access  to  food.  It  will  reduce  the  poverty  levels  of  low-income \ngroups. The focus of the Project will be on improving access of the poor to food, income, and \nlivelihood  support.  It  will  assist  in  relieving  the  immediate  fiscal  pressures  because  of  a  sharp \nrise in safety net expenditures. It will also assist in sustaining the external balance, aggravated \nby higher import costs for food grains.  \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  provide  short-term  transitional  support  to  help  the  Government  meet \nunexpected high expenditures for safety net programs for the poor and vulnerable affected by \nsoaring  food  prices.  It  will  provide  $170  million  to  finance  the  programs.  In  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the financing will only be used for essential \nimports  identified  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  safety  net  programs  for  food  security \n(Appendix 10). Following are the major outputs of the Project:  \n \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\nOutput  1:  Strengthened open market sales of food grains with wider coverage \nto  ensure  food  security  for  1.1  million  person-months  of  targeted  poor  and \nvulnerable  people.  The  hardship  of  poor  people  affected  by  higher  food  prices \n\n                                                 \n18   ADB.  1999.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Strengthening  Project  Portfolio \n\nPerformance. Manila.  \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nwill  be  mitigated  with  expanded  coverage  and  improved  efficiency  under  open \nmarket sales.    \nOutput 2: Enhanced food entitlements for 5.4 million person-months for the poor \nand  vulnerable  to  survive  short-term  food  deficits.  The  poor  and  vulnerable  will \nhave  better  access  to  food  through  various  safety  net  programs,  such  as  the \nvulnerable  group  development  program,  vulnerable  group  feeding  program,  test \nrelief  (food),  gratuitous  relief,  food  assistance  for  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  tribal \npeople, and the food for work program. Employment opportunities will be created \nfor the poor and vulnerable, disadvantaged groups, and functionally landless and \nlow-income  earners  through  food  grain  transfer,  which  will  help  improve  rural \ninfrastructure development through the participation of low-income communities.    \nOutput 3: Enhanced purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable by generating \nrural employment for 1 million person-months. Employment guarantee schemes \nwill  create  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  in  poverty-\nstricken areas when unemployment is at its peak.  \nOutput  4:  A  more  effective  and  efficient  food  security  monitoring  system.  This \ncomponent will be assisted by the attached TA to support reform measures and \nfiduciary  oversight  to  strengthen  monitoring  for  increasing  the  efficiency  of \nongoing safety net programs, complementing assistance from other development \npartners. \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\nC. \n \n33. \nConsultation,  Coordination,  and  Partnerships.  The  Project  was  formulated  and \nprepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  Government  and  Bangladesh\u2019s  development  partners. \nThe  project  design  incorporates  feedback  from  beneficiaries,  including  vulnerable  groups, \nduring  the  needs  assessment.  The  Project  is  based  on  the  joint  needs  assessment  of  the \nGovernment,  ADB,  JBIC,  and  World  Bank  with  the  support  of  other  development  partners \nincluding  FAO,  IMF,  USAID  and  WFP.  Food  security  assessments  by  Bangladesh  Institute  of \nDevelopment Studies were also considered in formulating the design of the Project.  \n \n34. \nLoan  Terms.  While  the  Project  is  being  processed  as  an  emergency  assistance  loan \nunder ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, regular ADF project lending terms are \nbeing  proposed  in  consultation  with  the  Government.  Regular  ADF  lending  term  already \nprovides an extra fiscal space. The Government\u2019s urgency is to mobilize adequate cash flow for \nproviding  transitional  safety  nets  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  Without  the  proposed  loan,  the \nGovernment would be forced to seek additional funding from the banking system at a high rate \nof interest for a shorter repayment period. This would adversely affect the Government\u2019s fiscal \nbalance as well as private sector operations. It would crowd out the private sector from available \nfinancing  sources,  and  could  cause  an  extended  impact  throughout  the  community.  The \nproposed loan will provide the necessary cash flow to provide urgent, transitional support to the \nsafety net programs for the poor and vulnerable. In these circumstances, the ADF lending terms \nare considered appropriate to accommodate this requirement. \n\n \nFlexible  Approach  and  Procurement.  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \n35. \namended  from  time  to  time)  provide  special  exemptions  for  emergency  assistance  that  are \nadopted for this Project.19 Previously, during natural disasters, exporting ADB member countries \nhave sold food supplies to Bangladesh on terms and conditions lower than normal world trade \n\n                                                 \n19     ADB.  2007.  Procurement  Guidelines.  Section  3.18.  Procurement  under  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance. \n\nManila. Available: www.adb.org/documents/guidelines/procurement/Guidelines-Procurement.pdf. \n\n\fprices.  Therefore,  under  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines,  wheat  and  rice  imports  may  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  for  emergency \nprocurement  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  due \nconsideration to economy and efficiency.  \n \n36. \nQuick  Disbursing.  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  expressly \ncontemplates  the  inclusion  of  quick-disbursing  components  in  emergency  assistance  loans  to \nfinance imports considered necessary. The drawdown for the retroactive financing and the one \nadvance to the imprest account will be quick-disbursing as provided under the policy.  \n  \nD. \n \n37. \n \nE. \n\nThe total cost of the government food safety net program is estimated at $1,293 million.   \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nfrom \n\nThe  Government  has  already  diverted  significant  resources \n\nits  general \n38. \ndevelopment  priorities  to  meet  public  food  requirements.  In  light  of  the  adverse  fiscal \nperformance  (para.15),  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  Special \nDrawing Rights 104,247,000 (equivalent to $170 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nto help finance the Project. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and other terms as those set out in the Loan Agreement. The Government will bear the \nforeign exchange risk. \n \n39. \nThe  Government  has  requested  financing  from  other  development  partners.  If  all  the \nsources of external funding materialize, the Government will be able to recoup a portion of the \nsafety net program expenditures.  \n \n40. \nCofinancing Opportunities. An underlying objective of ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance Policy is to coordinate with development partners, minimize duplication, encourage \ncofinancing,  and  have  a  catalytic  effect  on  the  provision  of  additional  resources.  Several  of \nthese  partners  may  be  willing  to  complement  ADB\u2019s  funds  for  the  Project  through  cofinancing \nand/or parallel financing. ADB has typically sought the approval of ADB\u2019s Board of Directors for \nthe administration of loan or grant funds from co-financiers only when cofinancing commitments \nare in place. ADB has received indications from some development partners of their interest in \nproviding loans and grants to finance the Project. JBIC and the Islamic Development Bank are \nconsidering cofinancing the Project with ADB. The World Bank is preparing parallel financing of \nthe  Project  (in  an  amount  preliminarily  estimated  at  $100  million).  As  it  is  envisaged  that \ncofinancing in the form of loans and/or grants will be provided from donors, which ADB will be \nrequested  to  administer,  the  scope  of  the  overall  project  financing  requirements  reflects  this \nlikely additional funding. In the event such financing does not materialize, the Government will \nfill  the  financing  gap.  Given  the  need  for  expediency  and  efficiency  in  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the \nfood crisis, ADB Management requests Board approval of the administration of such cofinanced \nfunds  obtained  from  development  partners  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval. \nManagement  will  confirm  and  approve  such  cofinanced  funds,  and  report  to  the  Board  in \naccordance  with  the  standard  reporting  procedures.  Any  proposed  cofinancing  that  would \nmaterially  affect  the  objectives,  purpose,  or scope  of  the Project  will be  processed  as  a  major \nchange  of  scope  and  circulated  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Administration \nInstructions 5.04 and the usual practice.  \n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nThe Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the EA and  MoFDM  will be the \n41. \nImplementing Agency. The loan will flow to the budget of the Government, which will contribute \nfunds  to  MoFDM\u2019s  account  through  the  budget  allocation  process.  MoFDM  will  arrange  the \nprocurement of eligible imports. All transactions will be conducted through bank accounts, with \nno  cash  changing  hands.  Overall  project  coordination  will  be  provided  by  a  food  security \nsteering  committee  (FSSC),  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  Finance  Division,  Ministry  of \nFinance.  The  FSSC  will  include  representatives  at  joint  secretary  level  from  the  Economic \nRelations  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  MoFDM,  Planning \nCommission,  and  Directorate  of  Food  and  Directorate  of  Relief  and  Rehabilitation  of  MoFDM. \nThe  FSSC  will  be  responsible  for  addressing  the  policy  and  governance  issues  addressed  by \nthe Project. \n \nTo ensure timely implementation, ADB will delegate the responsibility for ADB\u2019s project \n42. \nadministration  to  the  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission,  which  has  extensive  experience  in \nadministering  similar  projects,  and  will  closely  monitor  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements \nunder the Project to ensure quality control and accelerated implementation through close follow-\nup and guidance to the relevant ministries and agencies on project implementation matters. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nAs the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be substantially \n\n43. \ncompleted by 30 June 2009. \n  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n44. \nEssential  imports  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Management  has  agreed  to  provide \nretroactive  financing  for a  maximum  30%  of  the  total  loan  amount  for  eligible imports  incurred \nnot  earlier  than  1  April    2008,  provided  that  the  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  agreed \nprocedures,  are  certified  by  the  Finance  Division,  and  the  certification  is  acceptable  to  ADB. \nRetroactive  financing  will  be  approved  under  the  following  conditions:  (i)  in  accordance  with \nagreed  procedures,  (ii)  verified  by  ADB,  (iii)  certified  by  the  Finance  Division,  and  (iv)  the \ncertification  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  advised  the  Government  that  provision  of  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. For the balance of the loan \nfunds, procurement details are outlined in para. 35. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nNo  consulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  emergency  assistance  loan.  \n\n45. \nConsulting services support for implementation will be provided under the attached TA project.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Monitoring and Anticorruption Measures \n\n46.  Strong  Oversight  Mechanisms  to  Manage  Fiduciary  Risks.  Emergency  assistance \nmust  be  supported  by  sound  financial  management  and  operational  procedures,  as  well  as \nmonitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Strengthened fiduciary risk mitigation measures\u2014such \nas  quality  government  audit  as  well  as  performance  audit, and  independent  monitoring  by  the \n\n \n\n\fImplementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED)  under  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nexternal audit by FAPAD\u2014are widely adopted under all ADB-assisted projects. Considering the \nGovernment\u2019s  expanded  safety  net  program,  joint  fiduciary  oversight  arrangements  will  be \nestablished  with  the  participation  of  major  development  partners  including  ADB,  JBIC,  and \nWorld Bank. To strengthen field level monitoring, the Government recently established a high-\nlevel  working  group  on  food  grain  management  (with  the  participation  of  FAO,  USAID  and \nWFP),  headed  by  the  director  general  of  the  Directorate  of  Food,  to  ensure  efficient  food \ndistribution  to  the  poor  and  effective  monitoring.  MoFDM  will  submit  quarterly  reports  in  an \nappropriate format to the Finance Division, FSSC, and ADB no later than 3 weeks after the end \nof  each  quarter.  The  quarterly  reports  will  cover  progress  and  distribution  through  different \nsafety net programs, and the expected completion date of the procurement of food grains. \n  \n47.  More resources will be allocated through the attached TA project for additional support in \nspecific  areas.  Based  on  recent  evaluation  of  the  Government\u2019s  safety  net  programs,  the  TA \nproject  complementing  ongoing  and  planned  support  by  EC  and  USAID  will  help  develop \nresults-based  monitoring  through  the  integration  of  an  impact  evaluation  system  to  track \nqualitative  changes  over  time  and  promote  active  participation  of  partners  in  the  monitoring. \nGreater emphasis will be placed on developing independent monitoring by IMED and external \naudit  by  FAPAD,  as  well  as  building  the  monitoring  capacity  of  the  line  agencies  to  minimize \nleakage.  Because  of  low  administrative  capacity  within  ministries,  options  for  contracting  out \nprogram monitoring to independent and competitively selected agencies will be considered with \nthe assistance of the development partners.  \n  \n48. \nCapacity development support will be provided  under the attached TA to manage food \nprocurement  and  distribution  in  a  transparent  and  effective  manner.  The  anticorruption \nmeasures adopted under the emergency assistance loan include (i) strict financial management \nwith submission of annual audited accounts and internal audit report by the EA; (ii) strengthened \ngovernment  monitoring;  (iii)  strong  project  supervision  with  appropriate  TA  consultancy  input; \n(iv) periodic reviews of accounts, statements of expenditure, and close monitoring of the safety \nnet  programs;  and  (v)  random  and  independent  spot  checks  by  ADB  staff  and  the  TA \nconsultants in coordination and consultation with the Government.  \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy   \n\n \n\n49. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  applied \nin  project \nimplementation.  \n \n50. \nThe  Government  and  EA  agree  to  cooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and  extend \nnecessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  well  as \nengagement  of  independent  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such \ninvestigations. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n All  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n51. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  or  as  agreed  with  ADB.  An  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished  by  the  EA  in  Bangladesh  Bank.  The  EA  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fadministering  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nThe specific additional arrangements are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRetroactive  financing.  Withdrawal  applications  must  be  accompanied  by  a \ncertificate  of  the  EA  confirming  that  the  value  of  the  eligible  expenditures  is \ngreater than the loan amount claimed for disbursement.  \nImprest  fund  procedure.  Withdrawal  applications  must  be  accompanied  by  a \ncertificate of the EA confirming that the amount of eligible expenditures to be paid \nfor  by  MoFDM  during  the  period  from  loan  effectiveness  to  30  June  2009  is \nprojected to be greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal. Payments \nfrom  the  imprest  account  should  only  be  used  for  financing  essential  imports \n(Appendix  10).  Advances  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  liquidated  with \nappropriate  supporting  documentation  as  agreed  by  ADB.  ADB  will  reserve  the \nright  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s documentation. \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n52. \nThe EA will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods financed by the \nloan  proceeds.  Project  accounts  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles. \nThe EA will ensure that the consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited annually by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh. The audited \nreports  and  related  financial  statements  in  English  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  6 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate.  The  audits  include  the  auditor\u2019s \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  procedures  for  imprest  account  and  statement  of  eligible  imports.  In \naddition to the government audit, for the procurement of goods financed from this loan, ADB or its \nagents  will  undertake  a  special  audit  in  coordination  with  FAPAD  and  IMED,  as  part  of  the  TA \nproject.  The  MoFDM  will  provide  ADB,  through  the  EA,  an  overall  project  completion  report \nproviding  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  performance,  social  and  economic \nimpact, and other details as requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n53. \nThe  EA  will  carry  out  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  will  report  to \nADB  on  a  monthly  basis.  Baseline  indicators  and  targets  are  indicated  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). The monthly reports and other outputs will provide inputs to \nthe Project\u2019s quarterly and overall progress reporting.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  throughout  project  implementation.  Given  the \n54. \nimplementation  period  and  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  midterm  review  will  be \nconducted unless ADB and the Government deem it necessary.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n55. \nTA  for  Strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  Institutional  Capacity  for  Improving  Food \nSecurity will be provided to support reform measures and fiduciary oversight supported by the \nProject (Appendix 12). The objective of the TA project is to improve the Government\u2019s capacity \nfor  planning  and  undertaking  mid-  and  long-term  interventions  to  improve  food  security, \nincluding strengthening  monitoring for increasing the efficiency of ongoing safety net programs. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  activities  of  MoFDM  will  focus  on  improving  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  ministry  to \nadminister,  manage,  and  monitor  safety  net  programs.  Activities  under  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  (MOA)  will  help  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  its  policy,  planning,  and \ncoordination  unit  for  planning  of  food  production,  input  requirement,  and  procurement  and \ndistribution  of  inputs.  The  cost  of  the  TA  project  is  estimated  at  $660,000.  ADB  will  provide \n$600,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. MoFDM will be the EA for the TA, \nand MOA will be the coordinating agency. An interministerial steering committee chaired by the \nsecretary  of  MoFDM  will  oversee  and  monitor  activities  under  the  TA  project.  MoFDM  will \nappoint a project director and MOA will appoint a project coordinator, both at the joint secretary \nor equivalent level. The TA project will commence on 1 September 2008 and will continue for 10 \nmonths.  Activities  under  this  TA  project  will  be  undertaken  in  close  coordination  with  the \nongoing and planned TA project for food policy implementation and monitoring, funded by EC \nand USAID and executed by FAO. \n   \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  provide  emergency  assistance  to  the  Government  for  expanding \ntargeted safety nets for the poor and vulnerable at a time when there are inadequate budgetary \nresources  for  financing  these  programs.  It  will  assist  in  sustaining  domestic  and  external \nbalances, affected by heightened international prices of food grains and other commodities. The \nincreased  availability  of  food  grains  caused  by  the  larger  imports  (facilitated  by  this  financing) \nwill  exert  downward  pressure  on  food  grain  prices.  The  assistance  will  foster  macroeconomic \nstability  by  reducing  the  need  for  domestic  borrowing,  thus  dampening  inflationary  pressures \nand avoiding crowding out domestic investment. Fiscal space will be created, making it possible \nto  reallocate  resources  to  other  essential  public  expenditures.  The  quick-disbursing  nature  of \nthe  Project  will  also  imply  that  the  assistance  would  be  provided  timely  to  the  targeted \nbeneficiaries.  Well-coordinated  and  targeted  safety  net  programs  will  provide  direct  support  to \nthe neediest at a substantially lower cost than more broad-based actions.  \n \nB. \n \n57. \nThe Project will help restore the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable who are at \na  greater  risk  of  hunger  and  malnutrition.  Those  most  vulnerable  to  food  price  shocks  will  be \nprotected from nutritional deprivation, erosion in real income, and asset shedding. A summary of \nthe  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  13.  The  Project  will  benefit  5  million \npeople\u2014including men, women, and children\u2014by creating and enhancing their access to food, \nlivelihood,  and  employment.  Poor  and  female-headed  households  will  receive  special \npreference  while  designing  such  programs  according  to  the  Government\u2019s  current  policy  and \npractice.  These  households  will  also  benefit  from  the  increased  supply  of  essential  food \ncommodities  at \nrequirements. \nDisadvantaged  groups\u2014including  the  landless,  indigenous  people,  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups\u2014will be covered under the programs. The Project will benefit the most vulnerable with \nshort-term relief of food and basic necessities in times of food crisis. The employment guarantee \nscheme  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  will  address  extreme  poverty  by  providing  employment \nopportunities in poverty-stricken areas. The TA project will help identify bottlenecks in delivering \nthe  safety  net  programs,  suggest  mechanisms  to  improve  the  programs\u2019  effectiveness  and \ncoverage,  and  reduce  leakages  from  the  targeted  programs.  These  will  also  benefit  the  poor \nand vulnerable. The TA project will also suggest means to ensure that indigenous peoples and \nother vulnerable groups have greater access to the benefits of the safety net programs.  \n\nthe  market,  helping  women  manage  household \n\nfood \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\nA  resettlement  framework  was  not  prepared  since  the  Project  involves  budgetary \n\n58. \nsupport for safety net programs, with no provision for any land acquisition or resettlement. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  category  C,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n\n59. \n(2002). Therefore, no environmental assessment was required.  \n  \nE. \n\nRisks \n\n60. \nBecause of the huge volume of emergency food to be distributed, there are some risks \nin the areas of storage and distribution, leakages, and lack of financial accountability in safety \nnet  programs.  Over  time,  Bangladesh  has  developed  good  capacity  and  long  experience  in \nmanaging  public  food  grain  distribution  and  has  strengthened  the  safeguards  necessary  to \nimplement the safety net and public food distribution programs and systems effectively. Recent \nmeasures, such as the establishment of a working group with donor participation to monitor the \npublic food programs, will mitigate these risks. Moreover, the Project and associated TA include \nfiduciary  oversight  of  the  components  of  the  funds  provided  and  disbursed  for  safety  net \nspending.  Another  risk  is  the  recurrence  of  natural  disasters,  and  the  related  extensive \ndamages, which would strain the country\u2019s administrative capacity in distributing food and other \nessentials, and exert fresh pressures on the budget, involving additional import of these items. \nThis  is  addressed  by  adopting  appropriate  mitigation  and  cost-effective  adaptation  measures \nagainst  floods  and  cyclones,  including  capacity  building,  which  would  reduce  damage  from \nfuture disasters.  \n  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n  \n61. \nhave given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, Finance Division, and MoFDM \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n    Public  food  distribution.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MoFDM  will \nfurther  improve  the  implementation  procedures  of  the  Government  public  food \ndistribution system to enhance the public food procurement procedures and the \nmanagement, distribution, and storage systems for public food. \n\n    Improving  effectiveness  of  safety  net  programs.  Within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness,  MoFDM,  in  coordination  with  the  relevant  government  agencies \nwill  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  safety  net  programs  by \nintegrating improved mechanisms to reach really needy vulnerable groups in the \nremote areas and including good governance measures. \n\n(iii)      Submission  of  quarterly  progress  reports.  MoFDM  will  submit  quarterly \nreports  to  the  EA  and  ADB  on  the  status  and  progress  of  the  project-related \nsafety net programs no later than 3 weeks after the end of each quarter.   \n(iv)       Audits.  The  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of  Bangladesh  will  conduct  an \nindependent  financial  audit(s)  during  project  implementation  to  determine  the \ndegree  to  which  project  funds  were  utilized  observing  standard  financial \npropriety,  practices,  and  regularity.  Other  audits,  as  required  under  ADB\u2019s \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  including  a  performance  evaluation \nof the safety net programs supported by this loan, will be undertaken.  \n\n\f(v) \n\n    Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning.  The  EA  will  ensure  performance  evaluation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nsafety  net  programs  and  other  project  services  by  IMED  and  submission  of  its \ninspection  report  to  ADB  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  completion  of  each \nfiscal year.  \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi)      Anticorruption.  Consistent  with  its  Anticorruption  Policy  and  commitment  to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate directly, or through its agents, any possible financial or management \nimpropriety in implementing the Project.  \nFocal  point  to  handle  complaints.  The  EA  will  appoint  a  focal  point  in  the \nrespective agencies to address any public complaints on financial irregularities in \nprocurement  and  distribution  of  food  grains,  and  other  services  relevant  to  this \nloan  and  will  ensure  that  appropriate  grievance  procedures  are  effectively \nimplemented.  The  EA  will  provide  a  biannual  review  and  report  to  ADB  on \ncomplaints received and resolutions undertaken. \n\n(viii)  Subsidies.  The  Government  will  undertake  dialogue  and  continue  to  review \noptions with the assistance of ADB and other development partners, to address \nthe sustainability of various subsidies affecting the agriculture sector. \nRoad map to increase agriculture productivity. The Government will approve \nand  implement  the  plan  of  action  that  has  been  developed  to  implement  the \nnational food policy within 26 identified areas of interventions with the assistance \nof the development partners. \n\n(ix) \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n \n62. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\n    the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 104,247,000 \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Emergency  Assistance  for  Food \nSecurity Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at \nthe  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter;

It plays a \n\u2018social insurance\u2019 role through alleviating miseries of the poor and vulnerable or those at risk of \nhunger due to any irreparable physical or economic shocks. Since the early 1970s, safety net \nprograms have had a tremendous impact on the improvement in the overall food security and \nnutrition status of the poorest people in Bangladesh. These programs have helped the poor and \nvulnerable  to  improve  their  livelihoods,  health  and  nutrition  status,  particularly  for  women  and \nchildren, and income generation. Women became more empowered than before and their ability \nto make decisions, mobilize resources, and exercise choices over various aspects of their lives \nhave improved. Income transfers from the safety net programs also played an important role in \nprotecting  and  expanding  asset  bases  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  While  safety  net  programs \nare an important component of the government\u2019s social protection strategy, expenditure on the \nprograms  is  fairly  low  and  lower  than  what  other  countries  at  similar  levels  of  development \nspend on these programs.  \n \n2. \nSafety net programs are mainly administered through the Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement,  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare,  and  the  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children\u2019s  Affairs \n(Appendix 6). Many of the programs are implemented in collaboration with the nongovernment \norganizations  and  are  often  cofinanced  by  the  development  partners.  While  the  largest \nprograms  are  food-based,  conditional  cash  transfers  have  become  increasingly  important, \nincluding  improved  access  to  schooling  for  children,  particularly  for  the  girl  children.  But  the \nfiscal constraints inhibit the program coverage to its desired level. \n \n3. \nFood  security  safety  nets  operation  is  a  system  that  has  been  carried  out  through  the \npublic food distribution system (PFDS) under the Directorate of Food, developed over the years \nwith  support  of  development  partners.  The  PFDS  plays  three  key  roles:  (i)  providing  price \nincentives  to  Bangladeshi  farmers  for  increased  production,  through  domestic  procurement  of \nrice and wheat; (ii) maintaining a security stock of food grains to meet emergencies arising from \ndisasters such as floods and cyclones; and (iii) supplying food-grains to various groups of the \npopulation. The PFDS\u2019 stocks of food grains must be rotated to accommodate new stocks and \nto prevent losses resulting from quality deterioration. The PFDS operates through 15 distribution \nchannels  that  broadly  fall  into  two  groups:  monetized  and  non-monetized  channels.  The  latter \nare  comprised  of  the  food-based  safety  net  programs,  accounting  for  71%  of  the  total  PFDS \ndistribution. \n \n4. \nSafety  net  programs  made  major  contributions  toward  price  stabilization,  particularly  of \nfood-grains, as well as in the reduction of the national poverty level, through protection from the \nfurther  worsening  of  the  hunger  situation  and  the  avoidance  of  a  major  joblessness  situation. \nThose who were extreme poor but lived closer to the poverty line were able to escape extreme \npoverty.  These  programs  also  played  a  major  role  in  developing  and  improving  the  country's \ncommunication  through  building  roads,  flood  protection  and  improvement  of  the  irrigation \nfacilities specifically through the construction and maintenance of embankments and channels, \n\n                                                 \n1     This section is based on the following reports:  \n       World  Bank.  2005.

The national poverty reduction strategy also emphasizes \nand recognizes safety net programs as a strategy for mitigating the sufferings of the poor and \nvulnerable groups including hardcore and ultra poor. \n \nSince the last decade, Government\u2019s safety net spending for food security has been less \n5. \nthan  1%  of  GDP  with  coverage  of  about  4  million  people  in  each  year.  But  spending  and \ncoverage varies in times of natural disasters and subsequent food-grain production shortfall. In \nFY2009, the Government will need to increase safety net expenditures for food security to $1.3 \nbillion or 1.5% of GDP for 5 million people because of higher domestic and international price of \nfood grains. The number of people covered under various safety net programs represents only a \nfraction of those in needs.  Increasing the coverage and maximizing the effect of the programs \nare therefore the major challenges. Attention is needed to: (i) increase the focus on programs \nthat  contribute  to  human  capital  development,  (ii)  reduce  the  impact  of  seasonality  in  the \navailability of work, (iii) increase the focus on the urban poor, and (iv) increase focus on other \ndisadvantaged  groups.  Right  targeting  play  important  role  in  maximizing  impacts  of  the \nprograms.  By  improving  currently  followed  targeting  criteria,  the  safety  net  programs  can  be \nmade  more  effective.  To  improve  targeting,  households  will  be  targeted  using  criteria  that  are \nmost  closely  related  to  occupation  and  income  rather  than  assets  such  as  land.  Targeting \ncriteria need to be consistent across programs.  \n \nLeakage  in  safety  net  programs  remains  an  important  issue.  Monetization  addresses \n6. \nsome of the concerns regarding leakages from food transfer programs. But it is not sufficient to \novercome the problem entirely. Minimizing the number of intermediaries in program delivery and \nmaking  the  decisions  of  intermediaries  transparent  has  been  considered  as  another  option. \nEven  when  benefits  have  been  monetized,  transfers  that  involve  intermediaries  making \ndecisions about variable entitlements can lead to leakage if decisions are not transparent. Food \ntransfers should also be based on transparent procedures that guarantee full delivery and are \nmonitored  to  ensure  that  intermediaries  are  accountable.  Leakage  can  go  undetected  for  long \nperiods, undermining a program, if there is little or no monitoring and evaluation. Realigning the \nincentives for service delivery is also a critical step in reducing leakages. Problems of leakage \nand  misallocation  may  go  undetected  because  of  inadequate  program  monitoring  and \nmanagement  capacity.  Putting  greater  emphasis  on  external  monitoring  as  well  as  building \nmonitoring  capacity  of  the  line  agencies  would  minimize  leakage.  Because  of  weak \nadministrative  capacity  within  ministries,  more  program  monitoring  could  be  contracted  out  to \nindependent  and  competitively  selected  agencies.  While  line  ministries  should  enhance  their \ncapacity to monitor programs on a day-to-day basis, this could be complemented by monitoring \ncarried  out  on  a  random  basis  by  external  agents  that  would  visit  sites  to  monitor  how \nbeneficiaries are targeted and selected, assess whether beneficiaries are receiving appropriate \nbenefits  in  a  timely  manner,  and  assess  whether  the  ministry  is  adequately  monitoring  its \nprograms.  Channels  should  be  developed  to  ensure  that  these  results  feed  back  into  the \nplanning  process  and  are  used  to  make  informed  decisions  on  redesigning  the  programs  if \nnecessary.  Attention  should  also  be  given  to  designing  alternative  qualitative/participatory \nbeneficiary assessment. Consideration also needs to be given to the application of randomized \nevaluation techniques for programs which are still at their early stages of development. \n \nPlanned  in  the  national  context,  all  safety  net  programs  cannot  equally  address  the \n7. \nregional  specificities \nriver-erosion  and  seasonal \nfrequent \nunemployment.  Disbursement  frequencies  and  amounts  of  benefits  for  such  areas  should  be \ndifferent  from  the  nationally  common  ones.  For  example,  duration  of vulnerable  group  feeding \n\nlike  proneness \n\nfloods, \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n33 \n\nschemes in Monga-prone areas2 of the Northern Bangladesh need to be expanded from three \nmonths  to  five  months.  In  flood  prone  river-basin  areas,  people  need  resettlement  and  house \nreconstruction loans as well as food subsidy during rainy seasons. While amount of vulnerable \ngroup feeding support needs to be increased in these areas especially during monsoon, food for \nwork scheme can be considered as viable safety-net option during other periods of the year.  \n \n8. \nFurther  sharpening  and  improvement  of  the  safety  net  programs  require:  (i)  more \ninvestment  in  building  management  capacity  of  the  national  partners  and  Government, \n(ii) assessing sustainability issues of the project benefits with particular focus on graduation of \nthe  participants  into  mainstream  development  programs  and  continued  access  to micro-credit, \n(iii) skills training  trades  and  process,  (iv)  involvement  of  male  family  members  in  the  relevant \nawareness  building  sessions  to  make  the  gender  mainstreaming  more  effective,  (v)  further \nstrengthening the role of nongovernment organizations in the women selection, and (vi) improve \nresults  based  monitoring  through  the  integration  of  an  impact  evaluation  system  to  track  the \nqualitative changes over time and promote active participation of partners in the monitoring. The \nabove recommendations are being and will be continued to be implemented with support of the \ndevelopment  partners  including  European  Commission,  World  Food  Program,  Food  and \nAgriculture Organization, United States Agency for International Development, and ADB. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Monga is seasonal food insecurity in ecologically vulnerable and economically weak parts of northwestern \n\nBangladesh. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9  34 \n \n\nBANGLADESH AGRICULTURE SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nThe Sector \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  FY2007,  agriculture  sector  contributed  22%  and  the  rural  non-farm  sector  largely \n1. \nlinked  with  agriculture  sector  contributed  about  33%  of  GDP.  Small  farm-size  and  rice- \ndominated  farming  systems  with  180%  cropping  intensity  are  the  key  features  of  Bangladesh \nagriculture.  About  85%  of  the  poor  in  Bangladesh  live  in  rural  areas  and  depend  directly  or \nindirectly  on  on-farm  activities  for  their  livelihoods.  Agriculture  comprising  of  crops,  livestock, \nfishery  and  forestry  subsectors  employs  two  thirds  of  the  total  labor  force  of  the  country. \nEnsuring  food  security  for  the  growing  population  and  reducing  poverty  are  intimately  linked. \nConsidering  food  availability  and  affordability  of  common  people,  agricultural  development \nremains  at  the  forefront  of  the  country\u2019s  development  agenda.  Despite  a  declining  direct \ncontribution  of  agriculture  to  GDP,  faster  growth  in  agriculture  sector  is  still  vital  for  ensuring \nfood security and sustainable poverty reduction in Bangladesh.  \n \n\n1.  Performance \n \n2. \nIn  Bangladesh,  the  performance  of  crops  (mostly  rice)  dominated  agriculture  sector  is \nlargely dependent on weather condition. As a disaster prone country, Bangladesh faces natural \ndisasters like flood, cyclone almost every year, but severity, intensity, and frequency differ from \nyear  to  year.  During  the  past  decades,  agriculture  sector  performed  reasonably  well  despite \nnatural  calamities,  comparatively  low  investment  and  inadequate  importance  attached  to  the \nsector by domestic policy makers and the development partners. Growth averaged 3% over the \nperiod from FY1990 to FY2007 despite numerous problems and constraints including increasing \nhigh cost of production inputs.     \n \n\n2.  Challenges and Opportunities  \n\n \n3. \nAt  present,  the  net  cultivable  area  stands  at  about  9  million  hectares  out  of  total  land \narea  of  about  14.8  million  hectares.  The  cultivable  land  is  declining  due  to  rapid  urbanization, \nhousing  and  other  infrastructure  development  including  industry  and  an  expanded  roads \ntransport  network. 1 Another  important  shift  is  the  increased  proportion  of  small  farm  holdings \nwith  declining  trend  of  medium  and  large-sized  farms.  Currently,  the  key  sector  challenges \ninclude  (i)  stagnant  farm  productivity;  (ii)  ensuring  availability  of  critical  production  inputs \n(fertilizers,  irrigation  water,  quality  seeds,  and  credit)  at  farmers\u2019  level;  (iii)  poor  marketing \nsystems  for  agricultural  commodities;  (iv)  absence  of  adequate  processing,  value  addition \nfacilities and lack of enabling environment for agribusiness development; and (v) low efficiency \nof public agencies in providing extension and technology services to the farmers.   \n \nBecause  of  agro-climatic  suitability,  many  economically  important  crops  including \n4. \ncereals can be grown throughout the year in most of the cultivable areas, which creates ample \nopportunities  for  undertaking  judicious  efforts  for  intensification  and  diversification  of  crops, \nparticularly in the flood free zones. Over the years, the share of agriculture expenditures (crops, \nlivestock, fisheries and forestry) in the Government budget has declined. Development partners\u2019 \nsupport  during  the  last  decade  for  the  sector  also  witnessed  declining  trend.  Despite  all \nchallenges, since independence in 1971, the annual food production increased almost two times \n(about  29.0  million  tons  in  FY2008  as  against  15  million  tons  in  FY1973)  and  simultaneously \n\n                                                 \n1   The  cultivable  land  has  shrunk  from  about  66%  in  1974  to  59%  in  1995,  mostly  because  of  rapidly  increasing \nurban and residential encroachment. The net cropped area has decreased by 6% from 59% to 53% during 1974 \nto 1996. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n35 \n\npopulation  also  almost  doubled  (74.3  million  in  1973  and  142.4  million  in  2008).  Despite  the \nachievement  of  a  near  self-sufficiency  in  rice  production  over  the  past  decades,  food  security \nremains elusive, especially in the years when production is affected by natural disasters. \n \nThe  strategies  for  moving  ahead  in  addressing  these  challenges  include  (i)  a  two-\n5. \npronged  approach  for  intensification  of  major  cereal  crops,  particularly  rice,  and  diversification \ninto high value horticultural crops; (ii) ensuring availability of critical production inputs at farmers \nlevel  at  reasonable  price;  (iii)  creating  enabling  environment  for  improving  processing,  value \naddition,  storage,  marketing  and  agribusiness  development;  (iv)  increasing  efficiency  of  public \nservice providing agencies; and (v) building adequate food reserve for quick market intervention \nby the Government.     \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n \n6. \nRecognizing  the  importance  and  impacts  of  agricultural  development,  the  Government \nprepared and adopted national agriculture policy, national land use policy, national water policy, \nand  national  agricultural  extension  policy  during  last  decades.  The  Government  took  various \nmeasures  to  transform  these  policies  into  actions,  but  in  many  cases  deficiencies  were \nobserved in reinforcing the agreed actions and regulations. In recognition of main driver of rural \ngrowth, major source of generating rural employment, ongoing private sector led transformation \n(commercial orientation) in agriculture sector, and intimate link between agricultural growth and \nrural  non-farm  economic  activities,  the  Government  has  identified  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment as a topmost development agenda for faster poverty reduction and ensuring food \nsecurity to the fast growing population of the country.  \n \nThe  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (NPRS) 2  identified  four  areas  of  focus  for \n7. \nagriculture  and  rural  development:  (i)  intensification  of  major  cereal  crops  including  rice;  (ii) \ndiversification  of  high  value  non-cereal  crops  (vegetables,  fruits,  pulses,  and  spices);  (iii) \ndevelopment of non crop agriculture (fishery and livestock including poultry); and (iv) promotion \nof rural non-farm activities (rural infrastructure, transport and services). The NPRS emphasized \nfood  security,  including  availability,  access  and  utilization  of  food.  It  calls  for  increased \nproductivity  through  ensuring  inputs  supply;  agricultural  trade  liberalization;  ensuring  national \nand local level stock of critical food items; assuring low cost food supply including disaster relief; \ntargeted  safety  nets  and  food  distribution  programs;  policy  support;  and  food  related \ninfrastructure  development.  Reflecting  the  strategic  focus  of  the  NPRS,  the  Government \napproved  in  2006  the  National  Food  Policy,  to  ensure  adequate  food  and  food  security  to  the \npoor and vulnerable.  \n\n \n8. \nIn  view  of  the  soaring  food  prices  and  limited  availability  of  cereal  grains  in  the \ninternational  market  for  import,  the  Government  is  placing  greater  emphasis  on  enhancing \ndomestic  food  production,  increasing  food  reserves  through  both  domestic  food  procurement \nand imports, improving and widening distribution  of staple food items, and improving efficiency \nin  food  procurement  and  distribution  system.  The  Government  quickly  responded  to  the  food \ncrisis  with  a  number  of  measures,  which  include  widening  and  improving  safety  net  programs \nand ensuring availability of critical inputs like fertilizer, irrigation water and improved seed and \ncredit  support  for  boosting  domestic  food  production  for  the  coming  season.  The  FY2009 \nnational budget is more friendly to farmers and pro-poor oriented and has significantly greater \nallocation for agriculture, rural development and poverty reduction.  \n \n                                                 \n2   Government of Bangladesh. 2005. Unlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction. \n\nDhaka.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9  36 \n \n\nADB Assistance in the Agriculture Sector \n\nC. \n \n9. \nADB  supported  policy  reforms  and  innovative  interventions  for  increasing  food  grain \nproduction,  inputs  liberalization,  agribusiness,  diversifying  crops,  and  developing  the  livestock \nand fisheries sectors. ADB has also assisted in conserving the environment, creating irrigation \nsystems,  fostering  small-scale  water  resource,  building  flood  protection,  and  ensuring  village \npeople\u2019s greater access to markets.  \n\n \nUnder  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh  for  2006\u201320103,  more  focused \n10. \ninterventions  on  crop  intensification  and  diversification,  agribusiness  development,  livestock \nentrepreneurship  development,  and  water  resources  management  are  undertaken,  aiming  to \nincrease farm productivity, enhance income of small and marginal farmers and ultimately benefit \nthe  rural  poor.  All  these  interventions  are  impacting  positively  on  improving  livelihoods  of  the \nproject  beneficiaries  including  farmers.  As  of  April  2008,  ADB  provided  51  concessional  loan \nprojects/programs amounting to $1.65 billion for the agriculture and natural resources sector, or \n10.4% of the country\u2019s total portfolio. Currently, six loan projects amounting to $205 million are \namong  the  ongoing  portfolio.  In  addition,  ADB,  as  a  long  standing  development  partner, \nsupported rural infrastructure development in Bangladesh, which contributed significantly to the \nimprovement  in  rural  connectivity  that  helped  marketing  of  agricultural  commodities  more \nefficiently by the farmers.  \n \n11. \nADB  through  its  recently  completed  country  programming  mission  confirmed  several \npipeline investment projects for the agriculture and natural resources sector during 2009\u20132011, \nwhich include (i) crop productivity and value adding support project, (ii) participatory small-scale \nwater  resources  development  project,  (iii)  second  command  area  development  project,  (iv) \nsustainable  rural  infrastructure  development  project,  and  (v)  third  participatory  livestock \ndevelopment  project.  In  addition,  ADB  will  assist  the  Government  with  technical  assistance \ngrant for institutional capacity building and for project preparation in the agriculture and natural \nresources sector.       \n \nD. \n\nFood Price Shocks \n \nRecent surge in food grain prices (particularly rice and wheat) and food shortage have \n12. \ncaused  tremendous  concern  around  the  world  and  in  particular  for  the  least  developed \ncountries,  such  as,  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh  faced  two  consecutive  devastating  floods  and  a \nsevere  cyclone  in  late  2007,  which,  among  others,  caused  significant  food  production  losses. \nThese  production  losses  combined  with  soaring  food  prices  in  the  international  markets \naggravated  the  situation,  which  contributed  adversely  to  the  significant  price  increase  for  food \ngrains and other food items in the domestic market.      \n \nSoaring  food  prices  have  hit  hard  the  poor  including  vulnerable  groups,  who  presently \n13. \nneed  to  spend  about  69%  of  their  income  on  buying  staple  food.  This  crisis  situation  has \nseriously eroded purchasing power of the poorer section of the population. If the current crisis is \nnot addressed properly and timely, the consequent effects would be continued food insecurity, \nmalnutrition  and  increased  hunger  among  poorer  section  of  the  population,  which  may \njeopardize  fight  against  poverty  and  slowdown  economic  growth  in  the  coming  years.  This \nprevailing food crisis warrants immediate response from the Government and the development \npartners.  \n  \n\n                                                 \n3    ADB. 2005.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nBangladesh being an importer of food grains faced tremendous pressure balancing the domestic need and supply of food in \nthe recent months. The country lost agricultural production due to several consecutive natural disasters like floods and cyclone \nin 2007. These combined with the food price shocks driven by higher international prices made the country struggle to ensure \naccess to food by all its citizens, especially the poor. Access to enough food for active healthy life is essential to sustain human \ndevelopment and economic growth. Availability, access and utilization of food are determined by domestic production, external \ntrade and efficient distribution. The Government had to face the dual challenge of controlling price and ensuring food security \nthrough  various  safety  net  programs  while  domestic  food  stock  was  depleting  before  the  boro  harvesting  season.  Ensuring \nadequate  stock  of  food,  timely  supply  of  agricultural  inputs,  efficiency  in  distribution  etc.  have  been  identified  as  means  to \novercome the challenge. ADB in the past has supported several projects in the agriculture and irrigation sectors contributing \ntoward increased agricultural productivity. The ongoing Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation Project contributed toward \nimport  of  food  to  support  the  Government  developing  its  food  stock,  which  are  contributing  towards  food  security.  The \nproposed Emergency Assistance for Food Security Project offers to be instrumental in supporting the government in expanding \nthe safety net programs for restoring income and livelihood of the poor and vulnerable affected by the rise in food prices.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  make  a  significant  contribution  in  cutting  poverty  by  ensuring  food  security  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable, which is consistent with the national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS). The NPRS emphasized on food security, \non  the  basis  of  availability-access-utilization  of  food.  It  calls  for  increased  productivity  through  ensuring  inputs  supply; \nagricultural  trade  liberalization;  ensuring  national  and  local  level  stock  of  critical  food  items;  assuring  low  cost  food  supply \nincluding  disaster  relief;  targeted  safety  net  and  food  distribution  program;  policy  support;  and  food  related  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  Ensuring  availability  of  food  at  a  reasonable  cost  at  the  time  of  need  is  critical,  which  is  dependent  upon \navailability  of  stock  and  smooth  distribution  mechanism.  The  Government  has  taken  a  multi-pronged  approach  to  face  the \ncrisis, which include the above mentioned areas and a proposed guaranteed employment program. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government  to  import  essential  food  items  for  stock  and  distribution  through  various  safety  net \nprograms including open market sale, food for work and the proposed guaranteed employment program.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-H) \n1. Key Issues \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nBangladesh  though  witnessed  a  modest  poverty  reduction  since  early  1990s,  it  remains  one  of  the  poorest  countries  of  the \nworld  with  40%  of  its  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  as  of  2005.  A  major  cause  of  poverty  in  the  country  is  loss  of \nassets,  lives  and  income  due  to  natural  disasters.  Since  independence  in  1971,  the  country  faced  many  disasters  like \ncyclones,  floods  and  droughts,  which  particularly  increased  hardship  of  the  poor.  The  floods  and  cyclone  of  2007  seriously \ndamaged livelihoods and income of millions of people. The livelihoods and food security of already weakened households were \nat jeopardy especially for the rural landless, small and marginal farmers and the microfinance beneficiaries. Impact on health \nwas  also  tremendous  causing  mostly  waterborne  disease,  including  diarrhea  and  subsequent  malnutrition  and  morbidity. \nHungry and grief stricken people resorted to relief and the Government had to initiate and expand several targeted safety net \nprograms and the food stock depleted.  \n \nTo make the matters worse, the food price rose to a level beyond reach of these helpless people. The high food price driven by \nhigh  international  price  and  internal  shortfall  due  to  several  disasters  drove  the  low  income  groups  in  great  food  insecurity. \nExpenditure on food rose to about 69% for about 30% of the poorest, especially on rice cutting expenditure on health and other \nnon-food  items.  The  domestic  cost  of  rice  production  increased  even  with  subsidized  agricultural  inputs  such  as  diesel  and \nurea fertilizer.  Bottlenecks in distribution and hoarding also aggravated the domestic price situation. Non-availability of food in \ninternational  markets  due  to  export  restrictions  imposed  by  different  countries  caused  severe  shortfall  in  domestic  stock \nsituation.  The  rising  food  inflation  affected  household  consumption  negatively  especially  for  the  poor  and  fixed  income \nhouseholds who had to incur high welfare loss.  The poor made up the depletion of real income due to inflation mainly through \nskipping meals or cutting protein consumption, which will have long-term effects on health and nutrition at the household level. \nThese  may  lead  to  further  sell  of  assets,  resorting  to  money  lenders  and  rural  urban  migration.  Many  of  the  negative \nconsequences are hidden and cannot be quantified. Women and poor and in some cases children had to seek additional jobs \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13   45 \n\nin  informal  sector  often  compelling  them  to  work  for  long  hours.  In  some  cases  children  had  to  skip  school  to  queue  up  to \ncollect rice from the markets. The marginal farmers and share croppers also suffered losses while they had to procure other \nitems  at  a  high  price  selling  their  own  products.  The  rise  in  food  price  also  led  to  more  unequal  distribution  of  income  and \nexpenditure as well as pushed the poor to hard core poor category as food takes the greater share of the total expenditure of \nthe poor families.  \n \nThe NPRS and the National Food Policy emphasize on extending the coverage of effective safety net and social protection for \npoverty  reduction.  The  proposed  Project  is  to  support  in  this  area.  The  Project  will  provide  budgetary  support  to  the \nGovernment  for  import  of  foods  for  ensuring  priced  and  non-priced  safety  net  programs  for  poor  and  vulnerable.  The \nGovernment will ensure the access of the poor to food through intensive and extensive targeted safety net programs. The poor \nof various regions of the country, especially the famine stricken areas, the char lands and other remote areas. will be covered \nunder  the  specific  safety  net  programs  like  food  for  work,  vulnerable  group  development,  guaranteed  employment  program \ndesigned  for  various  target  groups  and  during  disasters.  The  TA  attached  to  the  Project  will  support  the  Government  in \nincreasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  targeted  safety  net  programs.  It  will  also  ensure  that  the  indigenous  people  are  covered \nunder such programs.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe project design includes features that will help reduction of poverty directly or indirectly. These are: \n(i) \nFinancial  support  to  the  Government  budget  to  import  foods  to  assist  in  reducing  the  fiscal  pressure  on  the  budget \narising from expanded programs for safety nets. The import of food items will contribute towards sustained food supply through \nincreased stock and distribution through various effective safety net programs.   \n \n(ii) \nThe  Project  will  help  implement  the  Government\u2019s  medium  and  long-term  food  security  road  map  as  outlined  in  its \nNational Food Policy and the plan of action for implementation of the National Food Policy through a TA support. The TA will \nalso review the distribution efficiency and coverage of the safety net programs in reaching the poor rural households and will \nsuggest means to improve them.  \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot applicable \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIt was observed that the poor were hard hit by the natural disasters (floods and cyclone) and food price hikes.  After the initial \nshock  of  disasters  people  wanted  employment.  Opportunities  for  wage  employment,  considered  the  first  priority  among  the \npoorest  were  decreased.  Fertilizer,  seeds,  poultry  feed  and  capital  were  the  needs  of  the  farmers.  Poor  faced  challenge  of \nreduction  of  employment  opportunities  coupled  with  reduction  in  real  wage  due  to  inflation.    The  poor  women  lost  self-\nemployment opportunities and faced the challenge in managing the household food security and nutritional needs.  \n \nProduction and stock are not indicators of accessibility of food by the vulnerable groups.  Employment, income, availability of \nfoods in market, efficient safety net programs, efficiency in distribution, affordability etc. are important issues. Because of the \nvarious  bottlenecks,  access  to  food  was  severely  hampered.  The  food  price  hike  not  only  caused  reduction  in  food \nconsumption  but  also  deteriorated  the  quality  of  consumption  affecting  the  nutrition  level  negatively  with  possible  long-term \nhealth impacts.  In some cases, school going children had to miss school or day laborers had to skip work hours for collecting \nfood grain from the open market sale system, where they had to be in the queue for long hours.   \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation.  \n \nThis  is  an  emergency  response  project  and  assessment  and  consultation  schedule  was  drawn  jointly  with  Government  and \nother development partners to ensure participation of relevant stakeholders. The relevant Ministries in the Government  were \nconsulted  on  the  basis  of  the  consultation  schedules.  A  participatory  process  was  adopted  to  identify  the  needs  and \ncomponents  of  the  Project  during  the  joint  ADB-JBIC-World  Bank  Mission.  Simultaneously,  ADB  identified  the  areas  to  be \nsupported  under  an  ADB-financed  loan  jointly  with  the  Government.  Consultation  with  civil  society  was  done  and  regular \ninteraction continued with various agencies during the assessment. ADB support for strengthening safety nets for the poor and \nvulnerable  was  supported  by  the  stakeholders.  The  outputs  of  the  mission  were:  (i)  formulation  of  a  project  design  and \ncomponents  to  be  supported,  (ii)  formulation  of  a  list  of  import  items  to  be  supported  under  the  Project,  and  (iii)  estimate  of \nbudget  support.  In  addition,  mechanisms  to  ensure  benefits  of  poor  and  women  through  improved  safety  net  programs  and \nemployment guarantee schemes were discussed, and identified. A TA was proposed to help implement medium and long term \nfood  security  strategy  and  road  map  by  the  Government  and  suggest  means  to  improve  the  distribution  efficiency  and \ncoverage of the safety net programs in reaching the poor.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13  46 \n \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment  \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, consultant \ninput, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nIn view of the emergency nature of the Project to provide budgetary support to the Government, a full-fledged C& P plan was \nnot prepared.   \n \nResources have been provided for a TA to assess the existing safety net programs and recommend measures to improve the \neffectiveness of the existing programs reaching the poor, women and other vulnerable groups. The civil society including local \ngovernment  institutions  will  be  involved  in  consultation  while  implementing  the  TA.  NGOs  are  involved  in  delivery  and \nmonitoring of some safety net programs and will continue to remain engaged.   \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  Strategy to maximize impacts on women:  Women are generally the ones to face the challenge of managing \nhouseholds' food security and nutrition needs. During the disasters and food crisis they were the ones hard hit in managing the \nhouseholds'  food  supply.  Female  headed  households  were  the  worst  sufferers.  Normally  women  are  the  ones  to  forgo  their \nfood and nutrition in favor of other members of the family with severe consequences on their own health. The project will help \nthe Government create stock of essential food items for ensuring household food security during crisis periods. The targeted \nsafety  net  programs  and  employment  guarantee  schemes  will  be  focused  on  the  poor  households  especially  the  female \nheaded ones.  Since women constitute majority of the poor population, the targeted programs will ensure their access to food.  \n   \n2.  Key  Actions.
