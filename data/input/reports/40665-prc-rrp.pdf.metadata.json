A  summary  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nalong  with  two  environmental  management  plans  on  11  July  2008,  and \nuploaded to the ADB website on 11 July 2008.  \n \nThe Project is a key urban environmental improvement initiative of the Jilin \nprovincial  government  (JPG),  and  the  Heilongjiang  provincial  government \n(HPG) to control pollution in the Songhua River Basin (SRB). It is classified \nas  a  targeted  intervention  because  it  contributes  to  achieving  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7, Target 10, which calls for the halving of the proportion \nof people without access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation by \n2015.  The  Project  will  help \nreduce  water  pollution, \n(ii)  protect  water  resources,  (iii)  address  water  shortages  (by  recycling \neffluent) and meet the demand for high-quality treated water through 2015, \n(iv)  control  nonpoint  source  pollution \nthrough  effective  solid  waste \nmanagement (SWM), (v) promote sustainable economic development, and \n(vi)  improve  the  environment  and  living  conditions  in  the  project  counties \nand cities (see footnotes 9 and 10 in the main text) in Jilin and Heilongjiang \nprovinces. The Project has three components, five subcomponents, and 20 \nactivities. The components are (i) an improved and expanded water supply \nand wastewater services in 11 counties and cities in Heilongjiang province; \n(ii)  improved  and  expanded  wastewater  facilities  and  SWM  in  15  counties \nand  cities  in  Jilin  province;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  and  training  on \nproject management, institutional and SWM and wastewater management, \nand tariff reform for all the project implementing agencies (IAs). The Project \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP)  which  includes  the \ngoals  of  improving  living  conditions  and  health  in  cities  and  promoting \nsustainable  economic  development.  It  also  supports  the  Songhua  River \nBasin  Water  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Master  Plan  (SRBPCMP), \nwhich calls for improving water quality in the SRB from the current class IV, \nV and below V to class III by 2020.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  catalyzes  both  government  and  private  investments \naimed  at  reducing  pollution  in  the  SRB.  The  ADB  East  Asia  Department \n(EARD)  and  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  are \nadopting  a  public\u2013private  partnership  approach  to  address  the  large \nwastewater  treatment  funding  needs  of  Heilongjiang  Province.  PSOD  is \npreparing a project for the Tsinghua Tongfang Water Engineering Company \nLimited  (TTWE)  which  is  currently  managing  the  largest  wastewater \n\n\fii \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\ntreatment plant in Harbin. The PSOD project would support TTWE through \nthe provision of equity of $12 million, or 20% of equity capital, whichever is \nlower,  and  loans  for  the  management  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  in \nother cities in Heilongjiang. TTWE is focusing on the water and wastewater \nis  exploring  private\u2013public  participation  (PPP) \nsector  business  and \nopportunities with the local governments. Through an equity investment of \n$3.4  million,  TTWE  is  a  minority  shareholder  in  the  Qitaihe  City  Central \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and effluent reuse subproject included \nin the proposed Project. This subproject will be financed by the ADB loan, \nlocal  government  counterpart  funds,  and  private  sector  funds.  The  TTWE \ninvestment would (i) solve the funding shortage at Qitaihe, and (ii) improve \nthe  management  and  operational  efficiency  at  Qitaihe  through  training \nprovided by TTWE. This pilot demonstration subproject could be replicated \nin other subprojects in Heilongjiang, and then in Jilin province.   \n \nThe proposed Project would significantly increase the wastewater treatment \ncapacity in medium-sized and small cities and counties in Heilongjiang and \nJilin provinces. ADB is also conducting a study on nonsovereign lending in \nurban  infrastructure  development  in  the  PRC.  The  public\u2013private  sector \napproach  to  the  wastewater  treatment  sector  could  be  replicated  in  Jilin \nprovince  and  elsewhere  in  the  PRC.  HPG  and  JPG  plan  to  invest  $1.655 \nbillion to increase wastewater treatment capacity and reduce pollution in the \nSonghua River in the 11th FYP. The proposed Project accounts for 23% of \nthis effort, demonstrating its strong catalytic impact in mobilizing resources \naimed at SRB pollution control. \n \nThe  project  counties  and  cities  of  Heilongjiang  province  (with  an  urban \npopulation  of  7.04  million)  and  Jilin  province  (an  urban  population  of  2.90 \nmillion) are located along the SRB. The SRB is the third largest river basin \nin the PRC, and it covers sections of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and \nthe  autonomous  region  of  Inner  Mongolia. The  Songhua  River  is  severely \npolluted with organic chemicals, heavy metals, and conventional pollutants, \nand  this  constrains  sustainable  economic  development  in  the  region. \nUnderdevelopment  of  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  in  the  project \ncounties  and  cities  in  Heilongjiang  province  and  Jilin  province  leads  to \nuntreated  wastewater  being  discharged  into  local  rivers,  and  eventually  to \nthe  pollution  of  the  SRB.  Water  quality  in  some  sections  of  the  Songhua \nRiver  and  its  tributaries  does  not  meet  class  V  of  the  PRC  Surface  Water \nQuality Standard. The lack of adequate wastewater management degrades \nlocal rivers, poses a threat to public health, and adversely affects the quality \nof life in the project counties and cities. Those in Heilongjiang province rely \nprimarily on surface water for their water supply. Under normal conditions, \nwater  demand  is  expected  to  exhaust  developed  capacity  in  the  project \ncounties and cities by 2010. These counties and cities experienced supply \nproblems  during  a  severe  episode  of  drought  in  2004,  leading  to \ndangerously  low  water  levels  in  the  reservoirs  and  a  resulting  loss  of \neffective treatment plant capacity. They also experienced low pressure and \nsupply  interruptions.  The  project  counties  and  cities  in  Jilin  province  have \ndomestic  SWM  featuring  domestic  waste  pick-up,  extensive  informal \nrecovery  of  recyclables,  and  disposal  in  a  managed  landfill.  Given  that \nexisting landfill sites will be fully utilized within 2 years, construction of new \n\n\fiii \n\nfacilities  is  urgently  needed.  The  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to \ncontrol of water pollution in the local rivers and in the SRB. It will also help \nsolve the current water shortage problems in the project cities and meet the \nfuture demand for high-quality treated water. \n  \nIn  2002,  during  the  processing  of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project \n($100  million),  ADB  had  extensive  discussions  with  the  Government  on \naddressing  pollution  control  in  the  SRB.  Consequently,  ADB  provided  a \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project  for  the  Songhua  River  Basin  Water \nQuality and Pollution Control Management. The TA, which was considered \nhighly  successful,  provided  strategic  policy  inputs  to  the  SRBPCMP.  The \nSRBPCMP  is  a  Government-approved  action  program  that  sets  pollution \ncontrol  targets  from  2006  to  2010  and  is  designed  to  control  urban \nenvironmental pollution and ecological damage by 2010.  \n \nThe  Jilin  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Development  (JWSSD)  Project \n($100  million),  approved  in  2005,  was  the  first  major  ADB  investment \ndirectly addressing pollution control in SRB. The Jilin Urban Environmental \nImprovement  (JUEI)  Project  ($100  million),  approved  in  2007  was  the \nsecond,  and  follows  the  priority  list  of  SRBPCMP.  The  proposed  Project, \nwith  an  indicative  ADB  loan  of  $200  million,  will  be  the  third  major  ADB \ninvestment in the SRB, and follows the priority list of SRBPCMP. A \u201cleading \ngroup\u201d  with  members \nthe  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission;  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection;  Ministry  of  Water \nResources; and the provincial governments of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Inner \nMongolia, is responsible for overseeing the preparation and implementation \nof the SRBPCMP. The proposed Project will complement the SRB pollution \ncontrol  efforts  underway  through  the  ongoing  JWSSD  and  JUEI  projects. \nThis  comprehensive  strategic  approach  to  addressing  pollution  control  in \nthe SRB will serve as a model for demonstration and replication elsewhere \nin the PRC. \n \nThe Project will enhance the urban environment and improve public health \nand the quality of life for urban residents in the project cities and counties in \nthe provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. This will be achieved by increasing \nwastewater treatment coverage, enhancing SWM, and improving the supply \nof  potable  water.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  less  pollution  and \nbetter water supply, wastewater management, and SWM in the SRB.  \n\nfrom \n\nThe investment cost of the project is estimated at $396.3 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $11.06 million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niv \n \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nState bonds, Heilongjiang \nLocal government equity, Heilongjiang \nState bonds, Jilin \nLocal government equity, Jilin \nTariffs \nPrivate sector equity (Tsinghua Tongfang) \nDomestic banks \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million equivalent) \n200.0 \n46.4 \n44.6 \n19.7 \n78.4 \n3.5 \n3.4 \n0.3 \n396.3 \n\n \n% of Total \n50.5 \n11.6 \n11.3 \n5.0 \n19.7 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.1 \n100.0 \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB will provide a loan of $200 million to finance 50.5% of the project cost, \nincluding  financing  charges  during  construction.  The  Government  will \nfinance  49.5%  through  a  combination  of  water  and  wastewater  tariffs, \ndomestic  bank  loans,  state  bonds,  and  capital  infusions  from  the  county \nand city governments.  \n \nADB\u2019s loan of $200 million will come from its ordinary capital resources and \nwill be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  for  US  dollar  loans.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending,  a  commitment  charge  of 0.15%  per  year,  and  such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.  \n \nFrom  the  total  loan  proceeds,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  will  make \n$100 million available to HPG and $100 million to JPG. HPG and JPG will \nmake  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  concerned  county  and  city \ngovernments on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan; \nthe loan proceeds will then be onlent to the implementing agencies (IAs) on \nthe  same  terms  and  conditions.  The  IAs  will  bear  the  risks  of  foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation for their portion of the loan proceeds, \nand  undertake  to  perform  the  obligations  as  provided  in  the  Project \nAgreement applicable to the IAs.   \n \nUntil 30 June 2014  \n\n \n31 December 2013 \n\n \nHPG is the Executing Agency (EA) for the Heilongjiang component. JPG is \nthe  EA  for  the  Jilin  component.  HPG  and  JPG  have  established  project \nleading groups (PLGs), each chaired by a vice governor. These will provide \noverall policy guidance, facilitate inter-agency coordination, and resolve any \ninstitutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  The  Heilongjiang \nPLG  consists  of  members  from  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Development \nand  Reform  Commission,  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Finance  Bureau,  the \nHeilongjiang  Provincial Audit  Bureau,  and  the  Heilongjiang  Environmental \nProtection  Department.  The  Jilin  PLG  consists  of  members  of  the  Jilin \n\n\fv \n\nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Jilin  Provincial  Finance \nBureau, and Jilin Provincial Environmental Protection Department. As they \nare  members  of  the  leading  group  for  the  SRBPCMP,  the  two  vice \ngovernors  will  be  able  to  ensure  effective  coordination  between  the  two \nprovinces  in  implementing  the  proposed  Project.  HPG  and  JPG  have  also \nestablished  project  management  offices  (PMOs),  each  with  a  director  and \nstaff.  The  project  county  and  city  governments  in  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin \nhave established similar organization structures including PMOs chaired by \nvice  mayors.  The  county  and  city  PMOs  will  maintain  interdepartmental \ncoordination and work closely with Heilongjiang and Jilin PMOs. \n \nHeilongjiang provincial government, Jilin provincial government  \n\n \nAll procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for \nworks estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for \nworks estimated to be equal to or less than the above ICB values, but more \nthan $100,000, will be procured on the basis of national competitive bidding \nprocedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), \nsubject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works \nestimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using  shopping \nprocedures. \n \nFor  Heilongjiang,  about  25  person-months  of  international  consultant \nexpertise  and  83  person-months  of  national  consultant  expertise  will  be \nrequired.  For  Jilin,  about  20  person-months  of  international  consultant \nexpertise  and  71  person-months  of  national  consultant  expertise  will  be \nrequired.  Consulting  services  are  required  for  (i)  providing  design  review \nand  advisory  services  to  ensure  that  the  technical  specifications,  detailed \ndesign  drawings,  and  implementation  schedules  properly  address  all \ntechnical  issues,  complying  with  engineering  norms,  and  are  up  to  date; \n(ii)  supporting  project  management; \nthe  project \nperformance management system; (iv) preparing a strategy for reduction of \nnonrevenue  water  along  with  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  water  supply; \n(v)  conducting  social,  environmental,  and \nresettlement  monitoring; \n(vi)  supporting  financial  management;  (vii)  helping  with  private  sector \nparticipation  initiatives;  (viii)  providing  training  on  project  management, \nprocurement, and construction supervision as well as on how to operate the \nwastewater collection and treatment facilities, SWM facilities, and the water \nsupply treatment and distribution systems; and (ix) improving operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M).  Two  consulting  firms  (one  for  each  province)  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\n(iii)  establishing \n\n  \n\nExecuting \nAgencies \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \n\n\fvi \n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  9.94  million  urban  residents  in  the  project \ncounties and cities in Heilongjiang province and Jilin province, whose living \nconditions and public health standards will be improved by (i) better water \nsupply,  wastewater  services,  solid  waste  management,  and  less  nonpoint \nsource pollution through increased SWM capacity; (ii) a lower incidence of \nwaterborne  diseases  to  below  2007  levels  (to  be  monitored  through  the \nproject  performance  management  system);  and  (iii)  saved  water  through \nwater reuse and a reduction in unaccounted-for water. \n \nThe  Project  will  result  in  better  management  and  utilization  of  water \nresources,  and  a  reduction  in  pollution  in  the  SRB,  bringing  positive  and \ntransjurisdictional  benefits  to  the  provinces  of  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin.  The \nwater  quality  improvements  in  the  SRB  will  also  contribute  to  integrated \nwater \nresource  management  and  pollution  control,  a  basin-wide \nmanagement program; and transboundary pollution prevention and control. \nThe  Project  will  secure  the  provision  of  clean  and  reliable  water  supply  to \nthe project counties and cities in Heilongjiang province by developing new \ndrinking  water  sources.  The  proposed  extension,  replacement,  and \nrehabilitation of water distribution systems will increase the proportion of the \npopulation with access to piped water supplies. These improvements in the \ndistribution  system  will  reduce  water  losses  and  reduce  the  risk  of \ncontamination  of  treated  water  within  the  distribution  system.  Recycling \nwastewater will reduce water pollution and address the water shortage.  \n \nOf  the  total  beneficiary  population,  about  325,000  persons  in  Heilongjiang \n(4.62%),  and  355,000  persons  in  Jilin  (12.24%)  are  classified  as  poor \nmeasured  by  the  weighted  average  local  urban  poverty  line  of  CNY2,196 \nper person per year. Major social measures to protect urban residents from \nfalling  into  poverty  include  (i)  a  living  allowance  for  laid-off  employees, \n(ii)  unemployment  insurance,  and  (iii)  a  social  support  program  under  the \nminimum-living-standard scheme. Further, the county and city governments \nhave  agreed  to  implement  poverty  reduction  measures,  including  (i) \nproviding  lifeline  tariffs,  (ii)  offering  water  bill  discounts  or  cash  rebates \namounting to 20\u201330% of monthly water bills for households living below the \npoverty line, and (iii) connecting the poorest households to tap water. The \nProject  will  create  a  minimum  of  1,380  person-years  of  direct  long\u2013term \nemployment  during  operation  of  the  facilities,  and  6,620  person-years  of \ndirect short-term employment during the 5-year construction period. About \nhalf of the construction jobs are unskilled and will be probably be filled by \ncurrently  unemployed  persons.  Public  health  benefits  will  accrue  through \n(i) a reduction in waterborne and airborne diseases, (ii) savings on medical \ntreatment  costs,  and  (iii)  improved  workforce  productivity.  The  Project  is \ntechnically  sound,  affordable \nfinancially  and \neconomically viable. \n \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  the  timely  implementation  and  economic \nviability  of  the  Project,  and  reduce  its  benefits:  (i)  amendments  and \nchanges  to  the  project  county  and  city  master  plans;  (ii)  lack  of  proper \noperation and maintenance of project facilities; (iii) ineffective organizational \nstructures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  IAs,  which  could  result  in \n\nto  beneficiaries,  and \n\n\fvii \n\ninefficient  project  development  and  delayed  implementation;  (iv)  delays  in \nthe provision of counterpart funding; (v) failure of the project county and city \ngovernments to increase water, wastewater, and solid waste tariffs to meet \ncost recovery targets; and (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement \nissues,  which  could  constrain  the  efficient  implementation  of  the  project \nworks and the restoration of livelihoods of the affected persons. The Project \ndoes not have any unusual technical risks.  \n \nThe  project  components  will  use  technology  that  conforms  to  international \nstandards.  Specific  construction  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the  use  of \nexperienced  consultants \nto  prepare  designs  and  monitor  project \nimplementation. \n\n  \n\n\f118  00'Eo\n\n130

China (PRC) for the Songhua  River  Basin Water Pollution Control \nand Management Project. \n \n2. \nIn line with its long-term goals to improve the urban environment and control pollution in \nthe  Songhua  River  Basin  (SRB),  the  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  to  help  increase  the  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste  management \n(SWM) capacity in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces in the northeast of the PRC. The Project is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy1  and  will  help  the  PRC  achieve  Millennium  Development \nGoal  7,  target  10  which  calls  for  a  halving  of  the  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  safe \ndrinking water and improved sanitation by 2015. This report is based on the findings of the Loan \nFact-Finding  Mission  and  discussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments,  relevant \nagencies, and community organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSince  the  PRC  initiated  economic  reforms  in  1978,  continuous  economic  growth  has \nbeen accompanied by rapid urbanization. The urban population has grown from 160 million in \n1975 to about 577.1 million in 2006. The urbanization rate increased from 17% to 43.9% in the \nsame  period,  and  is  expected  to  reach  55%  (or  about  700  million)  in  2030.  This  rapid \nurbanization over three decades of economic reform was largely fueled by the transformation of \nsuburban areas from farming to nonfarming activities, and by the massive migration of surplus \nrural labor to urban areas. The number of cities in the PRC increased from 193 in 1978 to 661 in \n2006. There  are  also  19,522  towns.  Of  the  total  urban  population  of  577.1  million  in  2006,  an \nestimated  115.5  million  (20%)  live  in  small  cities  and  239.1  million  (41%)  in  towns.2  The \nGovernment  highlighted  sustainable  urbanization  as  a  key  policy  priority  in  the  11th  Five-Year \nPlan (FYP), 2006\u20132010. \n \n4. \nRapid urbanization in the PRC has taken a severe toll on the environment, and has also \nchallenged  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to  promote  good  governance,  effective  planning \nand management, sustainable financing, and timely delivery of public services. While significant \nprogress has been made in building urban infrastructure over the past two decades, it tends to \nbe  concentrated  on  the  more  highly  developed  eastern  and  southern  coastal  plains.  The \nexpansion and upgrading of public services has not kept pace with rapid industrial growth. The \nmigration  to  urban  centers  currently  taking  place  in  the  inland  regions  (in  response  to \ngovernment  policies  to  promote  economic  development  and  job  creation  in  these  areas)  is \nputting a further strain on urban infrastructure and services.  \n \n5. \nCities in the north and west and around the SRB are experiencing widespread pollution \ncaused  by  the  discharge  of  untreated  wastewater  and  improper  management  of  solid  waste. \nShortages  of  safe  drinking  water  are  also  common,  particularly  in  the  north  of  the  PRC.  The \nGovernment has classified more than 108 cities as having serious water problems, and 60 as \nbeing critically short of water. The situation has been exacerbated by the pollution of raw water \nsources  by  the  discharge  of  inadequately  treated  agricultural,  municipal,  and  industrial \nwastewater.  \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2   Data  for  towns  are  adapted  from  \u201c2006  China  Urban  Development  Report\u201d,  and  for  small  cities  from  China \n\nEconomic Information Network.  \n\n\f2 \n\n       \n\n6. \nThe enormous volume of wastewater and solid waste generated by PRC\u2019s urban areas \nposes a major environmental threat to the country\u2019s rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers. In \n2006, the PRC generated about 54.0 billion cubic meters (m3) of wastewater3\u2014about 55% from \nmunicipal  sources  and  45%  from  industrial  sources.  Currently,  about  90%  of  industrial \nwastewater  is  treated  before  discharge  to  municipal  sewers.  Municipal  wastewater  is  a  major \ncontributor to the pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes. As of 2006, only about 57% of urban \nwastewater was treated (compared with 34% in 2000); the rest was discharged untreated into \nrivers and lakes. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) maintains a network of 3,200 \nwater  quality  monitoring  stations  nationwide. According  to  the  2005  State  of  the  Environment \nReport,4  about  41%  of  the  water  in  the  seven  major  river  basins5  does  not  meet  the  class  III \nnational  water  quality  standard.6  Of  the  50  lakes  that  are  regularly  monitored,  13  are  partially \npolluted,  19  are  seriously  polluted,  and  only  18  meet  the  class  III  standard.  Surface  water \nsources serving municipal water supply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under the \ncurrent water quality standards.  \n \n7. \nThe  amount  of  solid  waste  generated  by  urban  areas  has  also  expanded  rapidly.  In \n2006,  the  PRC  generated  186  million  tons  of  solid  waste\u2014an  increase  of  57%  over  the  2001 \nvolume of 118 million tons. However, the increase in treatment capacity has not kept pace, and \nthe capacity that has been developed is mainly for large cities. Few small cities and towns have \nwastewater and solid waste facilities. In addition to direct adverse impacts on public health, the \ngrowing  and  uncontrolled  disposal  of  solid  waste  contributes  to  increasing  contamination  of \ngroundwater supplies through inadequate leachate collection systems.  \n \n8. \nIn  the  11th  FYP,  the  Government  prioritized  environmental  issues,  including  water  and \nair  pollution,  through  policy  reform,  more  investment,  and  better  urban  infrastructure \nmanagement.  Recognizing  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and  pollution  controls  are \nessential  for  sustainable  economic  growth,  the  Government  has  incorporated  environmental \nprotection  as  a  national  priority  in  its  development  strategy.  In  addition  to  enacting \nenvironmental  protection  laws  and  implementing  regulations  that  emphasize  preventive \nmeasures,  the  polluter  pays  principle,  and  decentralized  environmental  management,  the \nGovernment  has  also  undertaken  numerous  programs,  including  those  for  wastewater \nmanagement.7  Industries  were  ordered  to  treat  wastewater  to  meet  the  national  wastewater \ndischarge  standards  by  the  end  of  2000;  municipalities  have  5-year  plans  to  address \nwastewater collection, treatment, and disposal; and pollution control plans have been developed \nand partially implemented for the key river basins. The Government has decreed8 that, by 2010, \nthe wastewater treatment rate in all cities of the PRC should not be lower than 60%, and that it \nshould  not  be  lower  than  70%  for  the  major  cities9  with  secondary  treatment  facilities.  The \ntreatment  level  required  is  dependent  on  the  water  environmental  functions  or  quality  class  of \nthe  receiving  water  body.  To  achieve  water  quality  class  I,  II,  or  III,  secondary  wastewater \ntreatment would normally be required.  \n                                                 \n3   State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  2006.

Class I is pristine, \nwhile class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal water \nsupply. \n\n7  The PRC Water Prevention and Control Law was first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The law was enacted \nto  prevent  and  control  water  pollution,  protect  and  to  improve  the  environment,  safeguard  human  health,  and \nensure  effective  utilization  of  water  resources.  The  law  also  establishes  standards  for  water  environment  quality \nand  for  discharge  of  water  pollutants  and  enumerates  the  planning,  supervision,  and  management  of  the \nprevention and control of water pollution. \n\n8  Ministry of Construction. 2000.

PRC. \n9  These include cities directly under the central Government, provincial capital cities and key tourist cities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on:  (i)  developing  water  sources;  (ii)  protecting \n9. \nexisting sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution; (iii) introducing water-efficient \ntechnologies  and  operations;  and  (iv)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to  encourage \nconservation  and  generate  necessary  funds  for  operation,  maintenance,  and  investment.  The \nGovernment\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that all water supply \nand  wastewater  projects  be  financially  sustainable  and  capable  of  cost  recovery.  An  urban \nsector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nKey  problems  and  opportunities  include  (i)  a  shortage  of  good  quality  drinking  water,  \n(ii) inadequate wastewater treatment capacity, (iii) inadequate SWM facilities and services, and \n(iv)  making  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  self-financing  through  tariff  reforms.  The \nproposed  Project  covers  five  counties  and  six  cities  in  Heilongjiang  Province;10  and  seven \ncounties, seven cities and one special administrative district in Jilin Province.11 A brief profile of \neach county and city is given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n11. \nSonghua River Basin (SRB). The SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC after \nthe  Yangtze  and  Yellow  rivers.  It  has  an  area  of  557,000  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  a \npopulation of 62 million. The SRB contains major cities, including Changchun and Harbin, and \nthe  PRC\u2019s  largest  oil  fields. Agriculture  is  well  developed  and  there  is  a  large  industrial  base. \nThe Songhua River catchment covers portions of three provinces and one autonomous region\u2013\nHeilongjiang,  Jilin  and  Liaoning  provinces  and  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  (IMAR). \nAbout  48.4%  of  the  catchment  is  located  in  Heilongjiang  province  (covering  59.4%  of  the \nprovincial  territory),  24.1%  in  Jilin  province  (71.6%  of  the  provincial  territory),  27.4%  in  IMAR \n(12.9%  of  the  autonomous  region\u2019s  territory)  and  0.1%  in  Liaoning  province  (0.36%  of  the \nprovincial  territory).  The  Songhua  River  has  two  headwaters;  in  the  west,  the  Nenjiang  River \noriginates from Yilehuli Mountain of the Greater Hinggan mountain range; and in the south, the \nSecond  Songhua  River  originates  from  the  Heavenly  Lake  on  top  of  the  Changbaishan \nMountain. The two rivers converge at Sanchakou (border of Heilongjiang and Jiin provinces) to \nform the Songhua river which joins the Heilongjiang River, enters the Russian Federation, and \neventually discharges to the sea.  \n \n12. \nThe  SRB  is  seriously  polluted  and  is  acknowledged  by  the  MEP  to  be  one  of  the  four \nmost polluted river basins in the PRC. Water pollution in the SRB, especially in relation to the \nprotection  of  drinking  water  resources  for  the  municipality  of  Harbin,  has  received  increased \nnational and international attention following a widely publicized pollution incident in the SRB in \nNovember  and  December  2005. The  Songhua River  is  contaminated  with  a  number  of  known \nand  suspected  trace  organic  chemicals,  metals,  and  conventional  pollutants.  It  is  classified  by \nthe Government as class IV in some sections of the Songhua River (and even falls below class \nV  during  the  6-month  low-flow  winter  season),  and  is  considered  unsuitable  for  municipal \ndomestic  water  use.  In  March  2003,  ADB  approved  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project  ($100 \nmillion)12  to  address  the  needs  of  Harbin  City,  with  a  population  of  3  million,  for  clean  and \nreliable drinking water from an alternative water source (Lalin River), since the existing source \n\n                                                 \n10    The five counties are: Fangzheng, Nenjiang, Tangyuan, Tonghe, and Yanshou. The six cities are Fujin, Harbin, \n\nJiamusi, Qitaihe, Qiqihar, and Shuangyashan. \n\n11    The seven counties are: Fusong, Fuyu, Huinan, Jingyu, Liuhe, Tonghua and Tongyu. The seven cities are Da\u2019an, \nDehui, Gongzhuling, Huadian, Jiaohe, Meihekou, and Yushu. The special administrative district is the Changbai \nMountain Administrative District.  \n\n12    ADB. 2003.

Because  of  the  deteriorating  water  quality  in  the \nSonghua  River,  the  Harbin  Municipal  Government  expedited  construction  of  the  Harbin  Water \nSupply Project, which was completed 1 year ahead of the original schedule. \n \n13. \nThe Government is focusing more attention on improving the SRB water quality during \nthe current and the next two FYPs. The PRC top leadership has expressed strong support for \npollution reduction and water quality improvement in the SRB, and the overall target is to ensure \nwater  quality  in  the  SRB  meets  the  PRC  class  III  water  quality  standards  by  2020.  The \nupgrading  of  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  (SEPA),  which  led  the \npreparation of the SRB  Water Pollution Prevention and Control Master Plan (SRBPCMP), into \nthe  MEP  will  further  strengthen  that  effort.  With  support  from  the  National  Development  and \nReform  Commission  (NDRC),  the  MEP  will  take  the  lead  while  each  of  the  provinces  will \nimplement their respective shares of the SRBPCMP.   \n \n14. \nProject Rationale. During the processing of the Harbin Water Supply Project, ADB held \nextensive  discussions  with  the  Government  on  addressing  pollution  control  in  the  SRB. \nConsequently,  in  2002 ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  water  quality  and  pollution \ncontrol management in the Songhua River Basin.13  \n \nThe TA,  which  was  highly  successful,14  had  the  following  impacts.  First,  it  developed  a \n15. \nlong-term vision for the SRB, consisting of a strategic plan identifying water quality objectives, \ntargets  and  reforms  and  strengthening  of  the  existing  river  basin  and  pollution  control \nmanagement  practices,  and  proposed  a  long-term  physical  investment  program.  Second,  it \nstrengthened \nfor  pollution  control  and \nmanagement at both the river basin and regional level, and prepared a road map outlining the \nkey milestones leading to the development of a river basin management framework within the \nPRC.  Third,  it  identified  knowledge  gaps  relating  particularly  to  nonpoint  sources  of  pollution, \nwater  quality  assessment  (notably  micropollutants),  and  water  quality  inventories.  Fourth,  it \ndeveloped an overall strategic plan for the SRB, both refining and prioritizing existing strategic \nplans developed by different institutions at different levels (river basin and provincial level). The \nstrategic plan includes the identification of an investment plan to be implemented over 15 years. \nFifth, it (i) assisted the Government to develop a long-term water pollution control plan for the \nSRB beyond 2010, and (ii) provided strategic policy inputs to the 11th FYP and the SRBPCMP. \nThe  SRBPCMP  (2006\u20132010),  approved  by  the  State  Council  on  29  March  2006,  is  an  action \nprogram  to  set  pollution  control  targets  from  2006  to  2010,  requiring  that  urban  environmental \npollution  and  ecological  damage  be  controlled  by  2010.  Untreated  wastewater  is  a  major \nproblem  in  the  SRB  and  the  SRBPCMP  specifies  that  the  wastewater  treatment  rate  in  large \nand medium-sized cities should not be less than 70% by 2010. The significant increase in the \nwastewater  treatment  capacity  under  the  proposed  Project  would  contribute  to  the  target  of \nimproving the water quality in the SRB, from the current class IV and V to class III by 2020.  \n \nThe  Jilin  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Development  (JWSSD)  Project  ($100  million),15 \n16. \napproved  in  2005,  was  the  first  major ADB  investment  directly  addressing  pollution  control  in \nSRB. The  Jilin  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  (JUEI)  Project  ($100  million),16  approved  in \n2007 was the second, and it follows the priority list of SRBPCMP. The proposed Project, with an \nindicative  ADB  loan  of  $200  million,  will  be  the  third  major  ADB  investment  in  the  SRB,  and \n\nthe  capacity  of  key  organizations  responsible \n\n                                                 \n13      ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\nmillion, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nfollows  the  priority  list  of  SRBPCMP.  This  comprehensive  strategic  approach  to  addressing \npollution control in the SRB will serve as a model for demonstration and replication elsewhere in \nthe  PRC.  The  proposed  Project  will  help  the  concerned  counties  and  cities  in  Heilongjiang \nprovince  to  achieve  a  wastewater  treatment  rate  of  70%  by  2012.  It  will  also  help  the  project \ncounties and cities in Jilin to achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 90% by 2012. Key areas for \nreplication  include,  (i)  the  approach  to  studying  the  complex  issues  of  SRB  water  quality  and \npollution  control  management;  (ii)  the  river  basin  approach  to  managing  water  quality;  \n(iii) the strategic pollution control action plan, which combines technical assessment, identifying \ninvestments on a prioritized basis, and institutional planning; and (iv) prioritized investments and \nrelated capacity building. \n \n17. \nThe  underdeveloped  wastewater  collection  and  wastewater  treatment  in  the  project \ncounties  and  cities  leads  to  the  discharge  of  untreated  wastewater  into  local  rivers,  and \neventually to the pollution of the SRB. Water quality in some sections of the Songhua River and \nits  tributaries  does  not  meet  class  V  of  the  PRC  surface  water  quality  standard.  The  lack  of \nadequate  wastewater  management  degrades  local  rivers,  poses  a  threat  to  public  health,  and \nadversely affects the quality of life in the project counties and cities. There is an urgent need to \nexpand  the  sewer  network  and  wastewater  treatment  capacity  in  project  counties  and  cities. \nHeilongjiang has identified 13 subprojects, focusing on water supply and wastewater treatment. \nJilin has identified 20 subprojects, focusing on wastewater treatment, solid waste management, \nand  river  improvement.  Sector  and  project  lending  were  thoroughly  discussed  and  considered \nas  alternative  approaches.17  The  Government  expressed  a  strong  preference  for  the  project \nlending approach because all subprojects have been identified and the feasibility study reports \nhave  been  completed,  and  there  was  an  urgent  need  to  implement  the  subprojects  in \naccordance with the SRBPCMP. All subprojects have one common impact, which is to improve \nthe urban environment and enhance the quality of life in project counties and cities, and they will \nall contribute significantly to pollution control in the SRB.  \n \nThe project counties and cities in Heilongjiang Province18 rely primarily on surface water \n18. \nfor  their  water  supply.  Under  normal  conditions,  water  demand  is  expected  to  exhaust \ndeveloped  capacity  in  the  project  counties  and  cities  by  2010.  These  counties  and  cities \nexperienced  supply  problems  during  a  severe  episode  of  drought  in  2004  leading  to \ndangerously  low  water  levels  in  the  reservoirs  and  loss  of  effective  treatment  plant  capacity. \nThey also experienced low pressure and supply interruptions.  \n \n19. \nThe project counties and cities in Jilin province have domestic SWM featuring domestic \nwaste  pick-up,  extensive  informal  recovery  of  recyclables,  and  disposal  in  a  managed  landfill. \nGiven  that  their  existing  landfill  sites  will  be  fully  utilized  within  2  years,  timely  construction  of \nnew  domestic  solid  waste  treatment  facilities  is  urgently  needed.  The  inadequate  solid  waste \nmanagement capacity causes nonpoint source pollution which contaminates the ground drinking \nwater supplies.   \n \n20. \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives  in  the  PRC  to  make  markets \nwork  more  efficiently  through  infrastructure  development  and  to  promote  environmental \nsustainability.  \n \n21. \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  builds  on  and  furthers  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  in  several  key  areas  including:  (i)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform,  (ii)  wastewater \nmanagement,  (iii)  upstream  and  basin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control,  (iv)  water \nconservation,  (v)  corporate  governance  and  enterprise  reform,  and  (vi)  private  sector \n                                                 \n17  During  a  mission  to  Beijing  in  January  2007,  detailed  discussions  were  undertaken  with  the  Government  on  the \n\nMFF, sector, and project lending modalities for the proposed Project. \n\n18  It includes Fujin City, Tangyuan County, Tonghe County, and Yanshou County. \n\n  \n\n\f6 \n\n       \n\nparticipation.  The  cost  recovery  regulations  are  stipulated  in  the  national  guidelines  on  water \nsupply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management. ADB has supported the water tariff \nreform  process  through  two  water  tariff  TA  projects19  with  the  Ministry  of  Construction  under \nwhich  the  market-oriented  National  Guidelines  on  Water  Tariffs  (NGWT)  were  developed, \npromulgated,  and  implemented.  The  water  tariff  TA  projects  (i)  strengthened  the  financial \nsustainability  of  municipal  water  supply  companies;  (ii)  piloted  implementation  of  the  national \nguidelines  in  the  selected  case  study  cities  of  Chengdu,  Fuzhou,  and  Zhangjiakou;  and  \n(iii)  recommended  financial  regulations  for  water  supply  companies  and  designed  nationwide \ntraining programs. The NGWT requires water supply companies to adopt full cost recovery as \ntheir  main  objective  when  they  set  water  tariffs. The  full cost  recovery  formula  for  water  tariffs \nalso  includes  a  return  on  equity  to  attract  private  investors.  The  NGWT  is  being  implemented \nnationwide. In 2002, ADB provided a TA project on Preparing the National Guidelines for Urban \nWastewater Tariffs and Management Study.20 The TA was completed in 2003 and assisted the \nGovernment to refine the wastewater tariff principles, develop national guidelines for wastewater \ntariffs,  and  improve  urban  wastewater  management.  In  2000, ADB  approved  a  TA  project  on \nstrengthening urban SWM.21 Completed in 2003, the TA assisted the Government to develop a \nnational  policy  framework  and  plans  for  urban  SWM,  refine  the  National  Guidelines  on  Solid \nWaste Tariffs,  and  conduct  related  capacity  building.  It  established  a  strong  foundation  for  the \nformulation of the national urban wastewater tariff guidelines for large and medium cities in the \nPRC.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  Government  to  develop  national  policy  frameworks  for \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  tariffs, including  tariff  calculation  methodologies  focusing  on  small \ncities and towns.22 All the project county and city governments have firm plans to increase water \ntariffs  on  an  average  basis  from  CNY2.50/m3  to  CNY2.80/m3  and  wastewater  tariffs  from  \nCNY 0.50/m3 to CNY0.80/m3 by 2009. This indicates the support for tariff reform in the project \ncounties and cities.23 The policy dialogue is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n22. \nIncreases in the tariff for water supply and wastewater treatment under the Project are \nimportant  for  full  cost  recovery,  which  is  needed  to  attract  private  sector  participation.  An \nassurance requires the project counties and cities to ensure that water and wastewater tariffs be \nset at a level that ensures full cost recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M), depreciation, \nand financial costs, including debt service obligations and a reasonable profit margin for water \nand  wastewater  treatment  during  the  project  operational  phase.  This  will  also  ensure  the \nfinancial sustainability of the Project.  \n \n23. \nADB  has  also  provided  TA  support  to  the  Government  on  the  use  of  market-based \ninstruments  to  enhance  private  sector  partnership  in  public  utilities,  mainly  for  water  supply, \nwastewater,  and  SWM.24  This  TA  analysed  the  issues  in  the  context  of  international  best \npractices  and  how  these  could  be  adopted  in  the  PRC.  The  PRC  resident  mission  and  the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department (PSOD) conducted a seminar in Beijing on 25 July 2007 \non  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  lending  for  the  provinces  of  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin.  ADB  is  also \nconducting a study on nonsovereign lending in urban infrastructure development in the PRC.25 \nThe  proposed  Project  will  create  the  environment  necessary  for  eventual  private  sector \nparticipation  by  pursuing  tariff  reform,  full  cost  recovery,  enterprise  reform,  and  improved \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1997.

Other  types  of  private  sector \nparticipation,  including  leasing  contracts  and  joint  ventures,  were  also  reviewed. Tariff  reforms \nand increases would make the IAs financially sustainable, and enable them to generate funds \nfor  future  water  and  wastewater  expansion  projects.  Consequently,  tariff  reforms  and  capacity \nbuilding under the Project would contribute to improved governance. \n \n24. \nExternal Assistance. Since 1992, ADB has provided 26 loans totalling $2,904 million to \nthe PRC for urban development and environment projects (Appendix 3). ADB has also provided \nabout  $52.7  million  for  more  than  75  TA  studies  to  prepare  these  projects,  and  to  review  and \nstudy  key  issues  in  water  resources,  urban  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  pollution \ncontrol  and  heating.  External  assistance  to  Heilongjiang  province  and  Jilin  province  has \nprincipally been provided by ADB and the World Bank.  \n \nLessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s  water  supply  loan  projects  in  the  PRC  have  generally  been \n25. \nimplemented  well.26  The  lessons  identified  from  evaluation  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \nprojects  highlight  the  importance  of  integrating  both  supply  and  demand  concerns  into  project \ndesign.  Encouraging  broad  reforms,  such  as  commercial  management,  and  introducing \ncompetition  will  promote  efficient  and  responsive  delivery  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices. Appropriate pricing policies for water and sanitation services are also required. Other \nlessons include the need to (i) review technical designs thoroughly; (ii) consider local conditions \nand constraints; (iii) support financial reform, particularly in establishing autonomous wastewater \nentities  and  tariff  increases  to  ensure  sustainability;  (iv)  strengthen  institutions,  particularly  by \ngiving  them  managerial  autonomy;  (v)  educate  the  public  in  environmental  improvement;  \n(vi)  consult  the  public  and  involve  the  community;  (vii)  address  resettlement  issues  early;  and \n(viii)  support  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment.  For \nexample,  the  PPTA  consultants  worked  closely  with  the  local  design  institutes  to  review  the \ndemand and supply side analysis for each subproject, through the use of historical and national \nbaseline  data  and  technical  design  standards.  This  resulted  in  adjustments  in  the  selection  of \ntechnologies  and  equipment,  optimization  of  the  engineering  designs  which  has  led  to \nreductions  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  Full  cost  recovery  through  a  phased \napproach  was  assessed  in  detail  and  this  was  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  EAs  and  IAs. \nTraining  and  institutional  strengthening  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project \ndesign  including,  among  others,  public  education  activities  on  environmental  health  and \nsanitation. \n \n26. \nA  recently  completed  portfolio  performance  review  of  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  and \nwaste management sector identified successes and deficiencies. It also acknowledged lessons \nfrom  portfolio  performance27  and  the  PRC  country  assistance  program  evaluation. Among  the \nmajor issues identified were (i) delays in the start-up of projects and in procurement, (ii) weak \ninstitutional arrangements for project implementation and sustainable operations, and (iii) a low \nproportion  of  civil  works  financing,  resulting  in  loan  savings  and  cancellation  of  surplus  loan \namounts.  During  project  processing,  lessons  were  taken  into  consideration  by  (i)  thoroughly \nevaluating  the  technical  designs  and  technologies;  (ii)  ensuring  an  adequate  debt\u2013equity  ratio \nfor the project IAs; (iii) undertaking rigorous sensitivity analysis of cash flows, and financial and \neconomic  analysis;  and  (iv)  incorporating  institutional  strengthening  measures  to  improve  the \nlevel of corporate governance to complement the capacity development components included in \nthe  Harbin  Water  Supply,  JWSSD  and  JUEI  projects.  The  proposed  Project  addresses  three \n\n                                                 \n26 In the project completion reports, the Dalian Water Supply Project was rated \u201cgenerally successful\u201d; and the Anhui \nEnvironmental Improvement Project, Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, and Suzhou Creek \nRehabilitation Project were all rated \u201chighly successful\u201d. The project performance audit report for the Dalian Water \nSupply Project rated it \u201chighly successful\u201d.  \n\n27 ADB. 2005.

This  will  be  achieved  by  increasing  wastewater  treatment  coverage, \nenhancing SWM, and improving the supply of potable water. The outcome of the Project will be \nreduced pollution and improved water supply, wastewater management, and SWM in the SRB.  \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  components  include  better  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  Heilongjiang \nprovince;  improved  wastewater  facilities,  SWM,  and  river  improvement  in  Jilin  province;  and \ninstitutional  capacity  building  for  efficient  project  implementation  and  management  for  both \nprovinces. The Project has three components, broken down into five subcomponents (outputs) \nand 20 activities as indicated in the design and monitoring framework. These will contribute to \nand support the 11th FYPs of the provincial governments in Heilongjiang and Jilin and the SRB \nWater  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Master  Plan  (SRBPCMP)  by  (i)  reducing  pollutant \nloading  to  the  SRB  through  direct  collection  and  treatment  of  wastewater  (point  sources)  and \nmunicipal solid wastes (nonpoint sources) in the project counties and cities; (ii) addressing the \nwater  shortage  problem  through  effluent  reuse;  (iii)  providing  a  supply  of  reliable  and  high-\nquality potable water in four counties and cities of Heilongjiang province; (iv) reducing both point \nand nonpoint sources of pollution in the Changbaishan Administrative District; (v) reducing the \nincidence of waterborne diseases; (vi) increasing the efficiency and management capacity of the \nfor  basin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control;  and  \nIAs;  (vii) \n(viii) improving cost recovery through a better tariff structure, with gradual increases to achieve \nfull cost recovery. A detailed description of project components is in Appendix 4.  \n \nComponent  I.  The  Heilongjiang  component  has  two  subcomponents:  (i)  water  supply \n29. \nand  (ii)  wastewater  treatment.  The  first  subcomponent  includes  the  construction  of  four  water \ntreatment plants (WTPs) with a cumulative capacity of 49,500 m3/day and 120 kilometers (km) \nof  water  transmission  pipelines.  The  second  includes  the  construction  of  nine  wastewater \ntreatment  plants  (WWTPs)  with  a  total  treatment  capacity  of  381,000  m3/day  and  199  km  of \nsewer pipelines.   \n \n30. \nComponent II. The Jilin component has three subcomponents: (i) wastewater treatment, \n(ii) SWM, and (iii) river improvement. The first subcomponent includes the construction of nine \nWWTPs  with  a  total  capacity  of  178,000  m3/day  and  368  km  of  sewer  pipelines.  The  second \nsubcomponent  includes  the  construction  of  10  sanitary  landfill  facilities  with  a  total  capacity  of \n2,400  tons  per  day  with  service  life  ranging  from  13  to  22  years.  The  third  subcomponent \nincludes  river  improvement  at  the  source  of  the  Songhua  River  including  (i)  two  WWTPs  with \ntotal capacity of 3,100 m3/day, (ii) three solid waste transfer stations with a total capacity of 40 \ntons per day, and (iii) 3.8 km of sewer pipelines.  \n \nComponent  III.  This  Component  provides  for  institutional  capacity  development  for \n31. \neffective  project  management  including  (i)  providing  training  to  strengthen  organizational \n\nintegrating  approaches \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2007.

The  proposed  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the \nbasin-wide  Songhua  water  resources  management  initiative,  and  the  SRBPCMP.  It  will \ncomplement the ongoing JWSSD Project and the JUIE Project to address pollution control in the \nSRB. The water quality improvements will contribute to integrated water resource management \nand  pollution  control,  a  basin-wide  management  program,  and  transboundary  pollution \nprevention and control. The proposed Project reflects a continuation of ADB\u2019s effort to improve \nthe  environment  of  the  SRB  following  the  JWSSD  Project  and  the  JUEI  Project.  Lessons \nlearned from the JWSDD Project and the JUEI Project regarding the integration of wastewater \ntreatment,  water  reuse,  and  water  resource  protection  are  continued  and  improved  under  the \nproposed  Project.  The  Project  focuses  on  strengthening  the  environmental  management \ninstitutions and the policy dialogue on integrated river basin management and pollution control \nin the SRB, resulting in improved environmental performance.  \n \n33. \nPublic\u2013Private Participation. The proposed Project is catalyzing additional public and \nprivate  sector  investments  in  reducing  pollution  in  the  SRB.  The  ADB  East  Asia  Department \n(EARD)  and  PSOD  are  adopting  a  public\u2013private  partnership  approach  to  address  the  large \nwastewater  treatment  funding  needs  for  Heilongjiang  province.  PSOD  is  preparing  a  project29 \nfor the Tsinghua Tongfang Water Engineering Company Limited (TTWE), a private firm, which is \ncurrently managing the largest WTP in Harbin. The PSOD project will provide an equity injection \nand  credit  lines30  to  the  TTWE  to  undertake  the  management  of  WTPs  and  WWTPs  in  other \ncities  in  Heilongjiang.  TTWE  is  the  borrower  and  the  sponsor  is  the  Tsinghua  Tongfang \nCompany  Limited,  a  publicly  listed  company,  which  is  an  integrated  solution  provider  in  the \ntechnology and environmental protection sector. TTWE is focusing on the water and wastewater \nsector  business  and \nlocal \ngovernments. TTWE, with an equity investment of $3.4 million, is a minority shareholder in the \nQitaihe City Central WWTP and an effluent reuse subproject included in the proposed Project. \nFor this subproject, the ADB loan will be used along with the local government counterpart funds \nand  private  funds.  The  TTWE  investment  would  (i)  solve  the  funding  shortage  problem  at \nQitaihe, and (ii) improve the management and operational efficiency at Qitaihe through training \nprovided by TTWE. This pilot demonstration subproject could be replicated in other subprojects \nin  Heilongjiang,  and  then  in  Jilin  province. TTWE  has  firm  plans  to  invest  in  six  other  cities  in \nHeilongjiang province. Further, two other foreign companies are actively involved in joint venture \ninvestments in wastewater treatment in Heilongjiang province.  \n \nTariff  Reform.  Some  of  the  project  counties  and  cities  have  committed  to  generate \n34. \nfunds  to  finance  the  water  and  wastewater  subcomponent  of  the  Project  from  water  and \nwastewater tariff increases amounting to $3.5 million. 31 \n \n                                                 \n29    Proposed  Songhua  River  Basin  Water  Pollution  Control  and  Management  Project  Private  Sector  Facility. \n\nis  exploring  private\u2013public  participation  opportunities  with \n\nManagement approved the concept paper on 17 October 2008. \n\n30    At the concept clearance stage, this tentatively includes (i) equity investment, the lower of $12 million and 20% of \nthe equity capital in TTWE; (ii) direct loans up to $35 million, in USD or CNY subject to ADB\u2019s funding availability, \nwith a tenure of up to 12 years; and (iii) B-loan up to $100 million through the complementary financing scheme \nof  ADB  in  USD.  Exact  amounts  and  detailed  terms  of  the  equity  investment,  direct  loans,  and  B-loans  will  be \nfirmed up during the due diligence and negotiations. \n\n31   The cities include Jiamusi in Heilongjiang ($1.24 million), Dehui ($0.75 million), Fuyu ($0.93 million), and Liuhe \n\n($0.54 million) in Jilin Province.   \n\n  \n\n\f10 \n\n       \n\n35. \nCatalytic  Impact.  The  policy  dialogue  on  pollution  control  in  the  SRB  that  started  with \nthe  preparation  of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project  and  the  cumulative  efforts  up  to  the \nproposed Project have had a large catalytic impact on mobilizing resources to reduce pollution \nin  the  SRB.  The  proposed  Project  is  catalyzing  both  additional  government  and  private \ninvestments to reduce pollution in the SRB.    \n \nD. \n \n36. \nThe  project  investment  is  estimated  at  $396.3  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and \nduties.

The  Government  of  the  PRC  will  make  the  loan  proceeds \navailable  to  the  HPG  and  JPG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the ADB  loan. \nHPG  and  JPG  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  concerned  county  and  city \ngovernments on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan; the loan proceeds will \nthen be onlent to the IAs on the same terms and conditions. The IAs will bear the risks of foreign \nexchange  and  interest  rate  variation  for  their  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds,  and  undertake  to \nperform the obligations as provided in the Project Agreement applicable to the IAs. The flow of \nfunds and the onlending arrangements are shown in Appendix 6. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n40. \nHPG  is  the  Executing Agency  (EA)  for  the  Heilongjiang  component.  JPG  is  the  EA  for \nthe  Jilin  component.  HPG  and  JPG  have  established  project  leading  groups  (PLGs),  each \nchaired by a vice governor. The PLG will provide overall policy guidance, facilitate interagency \ncoordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  The \nHeilongjiang  PLG  consists  of  members  from  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Development  and \nReform Commission, Heilongjiang Provincial Finance Bureau, the Heilongjiang Provincial Audit \nBureau,  and  the  Heilongjiang  Environmental  Protection  Department. The  Jilin  PLG  consists  of \nthe Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission, Jilin Provincial Finance Bureau, and \nJilin  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department.  Effective  project  coordination  between \nHeilongjiang  and  Jilin  would  be  ensured  through  (i)  the  SRBPCMP  leading  group,  which  is \nchaired by the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), and consists of, among others,34 the \nvice governors of Heilongjiang and Jililn as members; (ii) three coordination meetings between \n\n                                                 \n32 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Construction Bank. \n33  State  bonds  issued  by  the  central  Government,  which  allocates  these  grant  funds  to  the  provinces  based  on \npriority. HPG and JPG in turn allocate the state bond grant funds to the subprojects included in the SRBPCMP. \n34 Ministry of Finance, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, and Ministry of \n\nConstruction. \n\n  \n\n\f12 \n\n       \n\nthe Jilin and Heilongjiang project management offices (PMOs); and (iii) ADB review missions. As \nthey are members of the leading group for the SRBPCMP, the two vice governors will be able to \nensure effective coordination between the two provinces in implementing the proposed Project. \nHPG and JPG have also established PMOs, each with a director and staff. The project county \nand  city  governments  in  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  have  also  established  similar  organization \nstructures,  including  PMOs  chaired  by  their  vice  mayors. The  county  and  city  level  PMOs  will \nmaintain interdepartmental coordination and work closely with Jilin and Heilongjiang PMOs. \n \n41. \nAll  the  IAs  listed  in Appendix  4  are  limited  liability  companies  incorporated  under  PRC \nCompany  Law.35  The  board  of  directors  of  each  IA  will  oversee  the  financial  and  operational \nmatters  of  each  IA,  including  (i)  hiring  and  firing  of  senior  management,  (ii)  reviewing  staffing \nand  remuneration  plans,  (iii)  reviewing  the  progress  of  construction  and  approving  annual \nconstruction  plans,  (iv)  reviewing  and  approving  annual  financial  budgets,  (v)  reviewing  the \ninvestment  plans  and  accounts  of  the  IAs,  and  (vi)  approving  the  procurement  of  major \nequipment and civil works contracts. The IAs will increase their staff strength significantly for the \nconstruction  period  and  when  operations  begin.  The  internal  controls  and  accounting  and \nauditing  procedures  of  the  IAs  were  reviewed  through  a  financial  management  assessment \n(FMA)  and  these  are  generally  in  order.  The  FMA  for  the  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  IAs  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. The IAs\u2019 technical and institutional capacities have been assessed, \nand  these  are  adequate  for  project  implementation.  The  IAs  will  retain  the  services  of  design \ninstitutes, specialist procurement agencies, and construction supervision companies to assist in \nthe  implementation  activities.  The  PMOs  and  IAs  will  have  a  number  of  their  staff  trained  in \nproject  management  and  relevant ADB  procedures  during  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \ninstitutional  and  capacity  building  needs  for  provincial,  county,  and  city  PMOs  and  IAs  have \nbeen assessed and are described in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n \n42. \nBased on discussions with each IA, each subproject implementation schedule has been \nfinalized. The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from 2009 to 2013 although \nsome  of  the  subprojects  are  planned  for  earlier  completion  (Appendix  7).  The  estimated \nimplementation  period  is  based  on  the  project  scope,  central  and  local  government \nrequirements,  and  construction \nimplementation \nschedule is considered realistic and achievable based on discussions with each IA because the \nproject  implementation  structure  is  already  in  place,  and  the  preparatory  works  have  already \nstarted. For some subprojects, the preliminary designs are underway.  \n \n\ntechnology  requirements.  The  attached \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n \n43. \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).36 Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and \ncontracts  for  works  estimated  to  cost  equal  or  less  than  the  above  ICB  values  but  more  than \n$100,000  shall  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  in \naccordance  with  the  PRC Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  modifications  agreed \nwith ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured \nusing  shopping  procedures.  For  ICB  invitations  for  bids,  invitations  for  prequalification,  draft \nprequalification  documents,  draft  bidding  documents,  and  prequalification  and  bid  evaluation \nreports are to be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. For NCB, the first draft English \n                                                 \n35 PRC Company Law. 1993. \n36  ADB  will  require  the  PMO  to  use  ADB-approved  standard  bidding  documents  (to  be  developed  as  necessary  to \n\nensure high quality and consistency of the documents) that will facilitate ADB review. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nlanguage  version  of  the  procurement  documents  should  be  submitted  for  ADB  review  and \napproval  regardless  of  the  estimated  contract  amount.  The  ADB-approved  procurement \ndocuments should then be used as a model for all NCB procurement financed by ADB for the \nProject, and need not be subjected to further review. ADB will review the bid evaluation report \nand  award  of  contract  on  a  post-review  basis.  For  shopping,  ADB  will  review  the  award  of \ncontract on a post-review basis. Procurement plan for subprojects in both provinces are being \nprepared  and  to  be  finalized.  The  summary  procurement  plans  for  the  subprojects  in  both \nprovinces  are  presented  in  Appendix  8,  and  the  detailed  procurement  plans  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n44. \nHPG  and  JPG  requested  (i)  advance  contracting,  which  includes  tendering  and  bid \nevaluation  for  civil  works  contract  packages,  preparation  of  tender  documents  and  bid \nevaluation for the procurement of materials, plant, equipment, and vehicles, and recruitment of \nconsultants;  and  (ii)  retroactive  financing  (Supplementary Appendix  G)  of  eligible  expenditures \nup  to  $10  million  (equivalent  to  10%  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  Heilongjiang),  and  $20  million \n(equivalent  to  20%  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  Jilin)  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness,  but  not \nearlier than 12 months before signing of the Loan Agreement. The issuance of invitations to bid \nunder  advance  procurement  action  will  be  subject  to ADB  approval. All  advance  procurement \nactions  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  or  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  as  appropriate. \nContracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  The  Government,  HPG,  JPG,  and  the  IAs  have  been  advised  that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nFor  the  Heilongjiang  component,  the  Project  provides  funding  for  an  estimated  25 \n45. \nperson-months of international and 83 person-months of national consulting services to support \nthe Heilongjiang PMO, local governments, and IAs in project implementation management and \ncapacity  building.  For  the  Jilin  component,  the  Project  provides  funding  for  an  estimated  20 \nperson-months of international and 71 person-months of national consulting services to support \nthe Jilin PMO, local governments, and IAs in project implementation management and capacity \nbuilding. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  (80:20)  and  requesting  full \ntechnical  proposals.  Consulting  services  are  required  for  (i)  providing  design  review  and \nadvisory  services  to  ensure  that  the  technical  specifications,  detailed  design  drawings,  and \nimplementation  schedules  are  properly  addressing  all  technical  issues,  complying  with \nengineering  norms,  and  are  up  to  date;  (ii)  project  management;  (iii)  establishing  the  project \nperformance  management  system  (PPMS);  (iv)  preparing  a  strategy  for  reducing  nonrevenue \nwater  along  with  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  water  supply;  (v)  social,  environmental,  and \nresettlement monitoring; (vi) financial management; (vii) helping with private sector participation \ninitiatives; (viii) providing training related to project management, procurement, and construction \nsupervision  as  well  as  specific  training  on  such  issues  as  how  to  efficiently  operate  the \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  facilities,  the  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  treatment \nfacilities and the water supply treatment and distribution systems; and (ix) improving O&M. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services is provided in Supplementary Appendix H.   \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n\f14 \n\n       \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Policy \n\n \n46. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998  and  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  HPG,  JPG,  local  governments  concerned,  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be \nincluded  in  the  loan  covenants  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright  of ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  HPG,  JPG,  concerned  county \nand city governments, and the IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  For  the  Project,  HPG  and  JPG  will  undertake  the \nfollowing  anticorruption  actions:  (i)  involve  government  officials  from  the  concerned  provincial \nand municipal departments in bidding and construction to enhance construction quality control \nand  supervise  effective  work;  (ii)  introduce  a  dual-signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works \ncontract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iii) periodically inspect \nthe  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (iv)  engage  the  project \nmanagement consultant to support PMO and the IAs to ensure good governance, accountability, \nand  transparency  in  project  operations;  (v)  in  consultation  with  relevant  central  government \nministries,  update  rules  and  regulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance  and  anticorruption \nand enhance transparency of the IAs\u2019 operations; and (vi) disclose audited financial statements \nand  project  accounts  and  contract  awards  on  the  project  websites  of  JPG  and  HPG,  the  local \ngovernments concerned, and the IAs. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n47. \nThe loan proceeds for the proposed Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and funds flow, two imprest accounts will be set up upon loan effectiveness at a \ncommercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  One  imprest  account  will  be  managed  by  Heilongjiang \nProvincial  Finance  Bureau,  and  the  other  by  the  Jilin  Provincial  Finance  Bureau.  The  initial \nadvance to be deposited in the respective imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of \nestimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  For  the  contracts  of \nlarge works under the Project, direct payment procedures will apply. If the Government initially \nfunds eligible expenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedures will be used. \nTo  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation  process,  the  statement  of  expenditures \n(SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  imprest  accounts  and \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual  payment.  The \npayments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on \nfull supporting documentation.     \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n48. \nA  loan  covenant  will  require  the  IAs  to  submit  independently  audited  annual  financial \nstatements and project accounts to ADB. The IAs will keep records to allow the identification of \ngoods  and  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds,  following  accounting  principles  and \npractices  prescribed  by  the  PRC  Accounting  Law,37  which  requires  enterprises  to  prepare \nfinancial statements and generally follow internationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs \nwill  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records.  The  financial  statements  of  the  project \naccounts and the annual corporate financial statements for IAs will be subject to external audit \n\n                                                 \n37 Accounting Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China was adopted by the Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of \n\nthe Sixth National People\u2019s Congress on 21 January 1985. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nby the concerned local government Audit Bureaus, the Heilongjiang Provincial Audit Bureau, the \nJilin Provincial Audit Bureau, and the State Audit Administration. The audits will be carried out in \naccordance  with  regulations  for  auditing  approved  by  the  State  Council  and  will  meet  ADB \nrequirements.  The  audit  reports  shall  include  a  separate  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the \nimprest  accounts  and  SOE.  The  IAs\u2019  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  audited  project \naccounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year for the \nentire  implementation  period. The  HPG,  JPG,  concerned  local  governments,  and  the  IAs  have \nbeen informed about the ADB policy requiring the submission of audited financial statements on \ntime. \n \n49. \nHPG, JPG, and the IAs will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  IA  performance.  The  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin \nPMOs  will  prepare  and  submit  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  (i)  progress  in  project \nactivities,  (ii)  problems  encountered  and  action  taken  during  the  period  under  review,  (iii)  the \nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  (iv)  progress  expected  in  the  next  half  year.  A  project \ncompletion  report  shall  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  3  months  after  the \ncompletion of the project facilities. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n50. \nThe initial PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were discussed \nwith  the  PMOs  and  IAs  during  project  preparation,  including  (i)  SRB  pollution  reduction;38  \n(ii)  service  levels;  (iii)  nonrevenue  water,  water  conservation,  and  treated  water  quality;  \n(iv) treated wastewater quality and other operational performance measures; (v) percentage of \nwastewater  collected  and  treated;  (vi)  solid  waste  collection,  transportation  and  treatment \nefficiency;  (vii)  public  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment;  (viii)  economic  data  to  monitor \nproject  impacts  on  improved  living  conditions  and  economic  opportunities;  (ix)  health  and \ngender data; (x) incidence of water-, vector-, and airborne diseases; and (xi) increase in public \nawareness of environmental protection.  \n \n51. \nAt  the  beginning  of  the  Project,  the  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  PMOs  and  the  IAs,  with  the \nassistance  of  consultants,39  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  generate \nsystematic  data  on  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  subprojects,  as  well  as  the  indicators  noted \nabove  to  measure  project  impact.  The  PMOs  and  IAs  will  (i)  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  (ii) \nconfirm  achievable  goals,  (iii) \nfirm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  \n(iv) establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. Under the \nPPMS  framework,  baseline  and progress  data will  be  reported  at  regular  time  intervals  by  the \nPMOs and the IAs, including semiannual reporting of the environmental management plan. The \nPMOs  and  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data  through  their \nmanagement information system, established at the time of loan implementation. The PPMS will \nbe  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. The PMOs and IAs, with the assistance of the \nconsultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB twice a year on the physical \nimplementation  and  financial  aspects  of  the  Project  from  commencement  until  2  years  after \nproject  completion,  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in  line  with  ADB \nrequirements.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n38 The loan consultants  will further review and indicate  3\u20134  specific indicators, e. g., chemical oxygen  demand and  \n\nbiological oxygen demand. \n\n39 The Jilin and Heilongjiang PMOs with the assistance of the consultants will review and incorporate as appropriate \n\nthe monitoring indicators for environmental protection and pollution control developed by MEP for the SRB. \n\n  \n\n\f16 \n\n       \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n52. \nADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation at least twice a year. \nIn addition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years \nafter  the  start  of  project  implementation.  This  will  include  a  detailed  review  of  the  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on \nthe  agenda  for  policy  reform  and  capacity-building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS \nactivities will be analyzed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Impacts and Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n53. \nThe Project will directly benefit about 9.94 million urban residents in the project counties \nand cities in Heilongjiang province and Jilin province, whose living conditions and public health \nstandards will be improved by (i) improved quality of water supply and wastewater services and \nsolid waste management and a reduction in nonpoint source pollution through increased SWM \ncapacity; (ii) reduced incidence of waterborne  diseases to below 2007 levels (to be monitored \nthrough the PPMS); and (iii) saved water through water reuse and a reduction in unaccounted \nfor water. \n \n54. \nThe Project will result in improved management and utilization of water resources, and a \nreduction  in  pollution  in  the  SRB,  bringing  positive  and  transjurisdictional  benefits  in  the \nprovinces  of  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin.  The  water  quality  improvements  in  the  SRB  will  also \ncontribute  to  integrated  water  resource  management  and  pollution  control,  a  basin-wide \nmanagement  program,  and  transboundary  pollution  prevention  and  control.  The  Project  will \nsecure  the  provision  of  a  clean  and  reliable  water  supply  to  the  project  counties  and  cities  in \nHeilongjiang  Province  by  developing  new  drinking  water  sources.  The  proposed  extension, \nreplacement, and rehabilitation of water distribution systems will increase the proportion of the \npopulation with access to piped water supplies. These improvements in the distribution system \nwill  reduce  water  losses  and  reduce  the  risk  of  contamination  of  treated  water  within  the \ndistribution  system.  Recycling  wastewater  will  reduce  water  pollution  and  address  water \nshortages.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n \n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \nResettlement impacts have been identified and resettlement plans have been prepared \n55. \nin accordance with PRC laws and regulations governing land acquisition and resettlement and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program  is \ndesigned to ensure that affected persons will be better off (or at least not worse off) as a result \nof  the  Project.  Overall,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  of  the  Project  will  be \nsignificant. A total of three full resettlement plans and 18 short resettlement plans with three due \ndiligence reports, and six statements of land acquisition and resettlement40 have been prepared \nby the IAs with the assistance of the local design institute. The 33 subprojects in Heilongjiang \nand  Jilin  province  will  require  the  permanent  acquisition  of  272.6  hectares  (ha)  of  land, \ntemporary  acquisition  of  125.5  ha,  and  dismantling  of  11,180.64  m2  of  residential  and  non-\nresidential structures. In total, 287 households with 1,523 persons will be permanently affected \nby land acquisition, 331 households with 1,067 persons by temporary land occupation, and 68 \nhouseholds with 238 persons by residential and nonresidential house demolition.  \n \n                                                 \n40  Statements  here  refer  to  the  subcomponents  that  involve  state-owned  land  to  be  acquired.  This  does  not  affect \n\nvillage committee and farmer households.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n56. \nThe total cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated to be CNY238.1 million \n($34.0  million).41  Of  the  total  resettlement  costs,  CNY46.0  million  ($6.6  million)  is  for \nHeilongjiang province and CNY192.1 million ($27.4 million) is for Jilin province. The measures \nfor  economic  rehabilitation  include:  (i)  provision  of  job  opportunities  to  the  affected  persons \nduring the project construction and operational phases, (ii) provision of basic social insurance to \naffected persons whose land is newly acquired, (iii) development of crops with higher economic \nvalue,  (iv)  promotion  and  development  of  new  enterprises  and  self-employed  secondary  and \ntertiary  businesses,  and  (v)  provision  of  technical  training  to  the  affected  persons  to  increase \ntheir skills. The PMOs and IAs will supervise implementation to ensure that vulnerable persons \nreceive  adequate  compensation,  housing  arrangements,  access  to  the  special  fund  and  the \nminimum living guarantee, and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes.  \n \n57. \nThe summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 9. HPG, JPG, the project county and city \ngovernments,  and  the  IAs  have  implemented  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005), \nwhich  requires  full  disclosure  of  the  resettlement  activities,  by  (i)  distributing  copies  of  the \nresettlement  information  booklet  to  affected  households  and  village  offices  on  10  July  2008,  \n(ii) posting the resettlement plans in village offices or resident committees on 15 July 2008, and \n(iii)  posting  English  versions  of  the  resettlement  plans  on  the  ADB  website  following  their \nendorsement by the project county and city governments, HPG, JPG, and the ADB Environment \nand Social Safeguard Division on 28 July 2008.  \n \nADB  requires  both  internal  and  external  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \n58. \naffected  persons  during  implementation.  The  IAs  will  report  progress  regularly  to  the  PMO, \nwhich  in  turn  will  summarize  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  progress  in  quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB. The PMO will also engage an independent monitor who will visit the \nsubprojects every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general welfare of those \naffected, (ii) make recommendations to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide advice \nto IAs and local officials. The monitor will pay special attention to vulnerable groups, including \nwomen  and  the  poor,  to  assess  whether  they  have  fully  regained  their  standard  of  living. \nMonitoring  and  evaluation  reports will  be  prepared  every  6  months  during  implementation  and \nannually  for  2  years  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be  submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, PMOs, and the IAs, and will be uploaded onto the ADB website.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\n \n59. \nPoverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB  guidelines  to  collect \ndetailed social information to inform project design and implementation. The analysis was also \nused to identify poverty reduction and social development objectives, outcomes, and indicators. \nIn  addition  to  the  socioeconomic  survey,  public  consultations  were  conducted  with  consumer \ngroups, business communities, government agencies, people affected by the Project, and civil \nsociety organizations. A participatory approach was adopted for project design and will continue \nduring project implementation. The poverty and social analysis identified vulnerable groups and \nopportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions  and  social  action  measures,  and  outlined  the \nparticipation and mitigation plans to help achieve positive social benefits. The Summary Poverty \nReduction  and  Social  Strategy  has  been  prepared  and  is  provided  in Appendix  10. The  social \nand poverty impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n60. \nThe Project will directly benefit an urban population of 9.94 million including 7.04 million \nin  Heilongjiang  province  and  2.9  million  in  Jilin  province.  Of  the  total  direct  beneficiary \npopulation,  about  6.85%  (4.62%  of  the  beneficiaries  in  Heilongjiang  Province,  and  12.24%  of \nthose  in  Jilin  Province)  are  classified  as  poor  based  on  the  weighted  average  local  urban \n\n                                                 \n41 The base resettlement costs excluding contingencies are estimated at CNY150.6 million ($21.52 million). \n\n  \n\n\f18 \n\n       \n\npoverty  line  of  CNY2,196  per  year.  Ethnic  minorities  are  scattered  across  the  project  counties \nand  cities  and  represent  4.1%  of  the  population. The  social  analysis  determined  that  they  are \nsocially and economically integrated with the majority population and will not be subject to any \nadverse impacts of the project as a result of the their minority status.  \n \nThe  Project  will  lead  to:  (i)  a  better  urban  environment,  including  more  sanitation, \n61. \npollution  control,  provision  of  clean  water,  and  a  reduction  in  wastewater  and  solid  waste \npollution in the project counties and cities; (ii) temporary jobs during the construction phase and \npermanent  jobs  during  the  operational  phase;  (iii)  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  water-  and \nvector-related  diseases,  with  an  associated  reduction  in  medical  costs,  and  in  the  number  of \nworkdays and school days lost; (iv) more environmental awareness; (v) fewer risks of pollution \nto  downstream  water  users;  (vi)  value-added  benefits  from  local  procurement;  and  (vii)  better \ninvestment  conditions  to  stimulate  the  local  economy  to  create  new  and  to  accelerate  the \nrehabilitation  of  the  ecological  system  of  the  project  counties  and  cities.  The  health  impact \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n62. \nThe  Project  will  create  6,620  person-years  of  direct  short-term  employment  with \nearnings  totalling  CNY89.1  million  per  year  during  the  project  construction  phase,  and  1,380 \nperson-years  of  direct  long-term  employment  with  wages  totalling  CNY18.4  million  per  year \nduring  the  project  operation  phase.  About  30%  of  the  short-term  employment  opportunities, \nincluding the jobs of manual labourers for excavation, material handling, vehicle operation, and \nfood provision, will be filled by the poor, women and minorities, earning CNY26.7 million during \nthe project construction phase.   \n \n63. \nTo ensure that vulnerable groups will gain maximum benefits from the Project, (i) priority \nwill be given to the vulnerable groups for the employment and training opportunities generated \nfrom  the  project  construction  and  operation  phases;  (ii)  the  selected  contractors  will  be \nsensitized to the need to provide maximum benefits to the vulnerable; and (iii) the contractors \nwill be required to adopt pro-active measures, such as quota systems and training programs for \nthe vulnerable group (e.g., the contracts of the contractors will specify that at least 15% of total \njobs and training opportunities will be provided to women and 15% to the poor and members of \nminorities).  \n \nBased on the health data provided by the respective local health bureaus and the results \n64. \nof the health impact analysis, it is estimated that the annual health cost savings in 2007 directly \nfrom the urban environmental improvement in the project area of SRB totals CNY509.3 million, \nand the net present value (NPV) of health benefits during from the period 2011\u20132032 is about \nCNY908.1  million.  The  result  is  consistent  with  WHO  reports  supporting  the  conclusion  that \nimproving water supply and sanitation can have a significant impact on human health. However, \nfor the full health benefits to be realized, close coordination will be carried out by each IA with \nthe  existing  public  environmental  awareness  and  hygiene  education  program  of \nthe \nimplementation,  a  social \nenvironmental  protection  and  health  bureaus.  During  project \ndevelopment specialist will be recruited to document and monitor the intensity of activities under \nthe public awareness programs. \n \nThe  affordability  of  water  and  wastewater  services  for  the  poor  has  been  assessed \n65. \nbased  on  the  proposed  tariffs  and  household  income  statistical  data.  These  indicate  that \naverage  households  and  households  in  the  lower  income  class  will  find  the  tariff  increase \naffordable,  since  it  will  represent  a  small  percentage  of  their  total  income.  The  impact  on \nhouseholds in the lowest income bracket may be significant, but it will be mitigated through the \nexisting  tariff  reduction  and  subsidy  program. These  subsidies  are  in  addition  to  the  minimum \nliving guarantee. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n66. \nA  participatory  process  has  been  used  throughout  the  project  preparation  and  this  will \ncontinue during project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A number of key indicators \nwill be used to monitor the poverty and social aspects of the Project.  \n \nC. \n \nA  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2008 \n67. \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation.  Incremental  benefits  and  costs  were  derived  by  evaluating  the  financial  position  of \nthe  IAs  under  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return \n(FIRR)  for  the  Project  was  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  7.6%  for  the  water  supply \nsubprojects,  and  6.7%  for  the  wastewater  subprojects,  which  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital in real terms of 2.8%. The financial analysis is in Appendix 11, \nand  the  detailed  financial  analysis  and  financial  projections  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K. \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  includes  examination  of  the  risk  that  (i)  project  costs  will  increase  by \n10%,  (ii)  O&M  costs  will  increase  by  10%,  and  (iii)  project  implementation  and  subsequent \nrealization of benefits will be delayed by a year. An affordability analysis was undertaken based \non  proposed  tariffs  and  household  income  data  from  the  social  survey.  Detailed  verification  of \nthe  local  financing  plan  indicates  that  the  equity  contributions  are  on  average  about  5%  of \nannual revenues from the concerned county and city governments, indicating minimal risk. The \ncounty  and  city  governments  have  sufficient  financial  resources  to  take  on  responsibility  for \nguaranteeing  the  loan  repayments,  and  have  provided  assurances  that  they  accept  this  risk. \nTariffs  under  the  Project  are  considered  affordable  if  the  combined  average  water  and \nwastewater  charges  are  less  than  5%  of  monthly  household  income.  The  estimated  tariffs  on \nthis  basis  are  affordable  to  the  average  household  (for  whom  they  represent  3.0%  of  monthly \nincome),  and  to  the  poorest  10%  of  households  (for  whom  they  represent  less  than  4%  of \nmonthly income before  accounting for poverty reduction measures that exist now or that have \nbeen committed to).  \n \n68. \nThe IAs agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included \nas  loan  covenants  covering  capital  structure  (debt\u2013equity),  debt  service  cover,  and  liquidity.  \nFinancial  projections  estimate  the  tariffs  required  for  an  appropriate  level  of  financial \nperformance.  Periodic  tariff  reviews  will  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor  financial \nperformance or of unexpected changes in tariff income. The financial sustainability of the Project \nwas  verified  through  a  financial  analysis  of  the  IAs.  Generally,  the  current  levels  of  tariffs  for \nwater supply and wastewater treatment in the provinces are sufficient to cover the costs of basic \noperation and maintenance. Tariffs will need to be increased to allow for full cost recovery when \nthe ADB-financed facilities come into operation. To this end, the Government has assured ADB \nthat (i) tariffs will be increased in phases and (ii) subsidies will be provided to ensure sustainable \nO&M of the project facilities. The Project will provide capacity building support for tariff reforms \nand tariff setting, and for financial management to ensure that sufficient funds are allocated for \nsustainable  O&M  of  the  project  facilities.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  subprojects  was \ndetermined. Annual  funds  required  for  capital  expenditures  during  project  implementation,  and \nO&M and debt services during operation were forecast and relevant debt coverage ratios were \nestimated. The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \n \n69. \nThe results of the financial management assessment (FMA) indicate that the EAs have \nsound financial management systems and adequate experience of managing projects funded by \nforeign  financial  institutions.  The  IAs  operate  as  state-owned  enterprises.  Accounting  and \nfinancial  management  systems  for  financial  reporting  and  accounting  were  adequate  for  loan \nimplementation, although there is potential to improve internal control procedures. As some of \nthe IAs do not have experience of working with externally funded projects, training for the IAs on \nADB  procedures  and  requirements  related  to  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  reporting, \n\n  \n\n\f20 \n\n       \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nmonitoring,  internal  control,  financial  management,  and  anticorruption  safeguards  will  need  to \nbe provided under the training component of the Project.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ongoing  provincial,  municipal,  and  river  basin \n70. \nenvironmental  programs,  contributing  significantly  to  pollution  control  in  the  SRB.  Public \nperceptions  and  preferences  have  been  evaluated  using  household  and  business  surveys. \nThese  showed  that  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  and  solid  waste  management \n(SWM)  rank  highest  in  priority  when  compared  with  a  range  of  other  public  services.  A \nquantitative  economic  analysis  also  demonstrates  the  value  of  the  Project.  The  economic \nanalysis was conducted for 25 years (including project construction) in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Project benefits and costs were estimated on \na with-project and without-project basis. Costs were divided into tradable and nontradable costs, \nand benefits were adjusted to account for nonincremental and incremental benefits. Incremental \neconomic  benefits  were  valued  on  the  basis  of  willingness  to  pay.  For  the  Heilongjiang \nsubprojects, the estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) ranges from 13.6% to 34.7%, \nwith an average EIRR of 19.5%. For the Jilin subprojects the EIRR ranges from 17.2% to 20%, \nwith an average EIRR of 18.4%. The EIRR for the Heilongjiang and Jilin components exceeds \nthe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  assumed  at  12%.  The  economic  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 12. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nE. \n \n71. \nThe  Government  has  met  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002). \nExtensive  public  consultations  involving  meetings  with  stakeholders,  focus  group  discussions, \nand  surveys  were  undertaken  twice  during  the  preparation  of  the  domestic  environmental \nimpact  assessments  (EIAs).  The  EIAs  summarize  the  environmental  impacts,  mitigation \nmeasures, and monitoring plans. The environmental management plan (EMP), prepared as part \nof  the  EIA,  will  guide  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  under  the  Project.  All  the  EIAs \nhave  been  approved  by  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department \n(HEPD)  and  Jilin  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department  (JEPD).  The  summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  the  EMP  have  been  confirmed  by  the \nGovernment. The SEIA concludes that the Project will have substantial positive environmental \nand socioeconomic benefits. The SEIA was circulated to the ADB Board and posted on the ADB \nwebsite on 11 July 2008.  \n \n \nThe  environmental  benefits  of  the  Project  include:  (i)  reducing  pollution  loads  to \n72. \nSonghua River and its tributaries significantly by intercepting and treating raw sewage currently \ndischarged into the rivers and its tributaries;42 (ii) significantly improving the quality of water for \nHarbin residents by reducing wastewater discharge into the river; (iii) improving sanitation and \nhygiene by providing clean water;43 and (iv) improving the quality of life by enhancing SWM.44 \nThe  SEIA  and  EIA  reports  concluded  that  adverse  impacts  on  the  physical  and  natural \nenvironment during the construction and operational stages of the Project would be insignificant \nwhen the mitigation measures specified in the SEIAs and EMPs are appropriately implemented. \nThe  incremental  costs  required  for mitigation  implementation  are  negligible  compared  with  the \ncost of the Project. The two EMPs will be further detailed in the design and construction phases. \n\n                                                 \n42 In Fangzheng County, Fujin City, Harbin City, Jiamusi City, Nenjiang County, Qiqihar City, Shuangyashan City, and \nTangyuan  County  of    Heilongjiang  Province  and  Dehui  City,  Gongzhuling  City,  Fusong  County,  Jingyu  County, \nLiuhe County, Tonghua County, Yushu City, and Changbaishan Mountain Administrative Area of  Jilin Province.  \n43 For the residents of Fujin City, Tangyuan County, Tonghe County, and Yanshou County of Heilongjiang Province. \n44 In Da\u2019an City, Fusong County, Huadian City, Huinan County, Jiaohe City, Jingyu County, Meihekou City, Tongyu \n\nCounty, Yushu City, and Changbaishan Mountain Administrative Area of Jilin Province. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe EMPs will be implemented by IAs, monitored and supervised by professional environmental \nmanagement  specialists  and  local  environmental  monitoring  centers,  and  reported  to  the  Jilin \nand Heilongjiang PMOs, HEPD, JEPD, and ADB. \n \nF. \n \n73. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns with proven records of reliable performance are adopted for water supply, wastewater \nmanagement,  and  SWM.  During  project  implementation,  the  consultants  will  support  the  two \nPMOs and IAs to ensure delivered equipment and works comply with the design requirements \nand  quality  standards.  The  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  or  economic \nviability,  and  reduce  the  benefits  of  the  Project:  (i)  amendments  and  changes  to  the  project \ncounty  and  city  master  plans;  (ii)  lack  of  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (iii)  ineffective \norganizational  structures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  IAs,  which  could  result  in  inefficient \nproject  development  and  delays  in  implementation;  (iv)  delays  in  the  provision  of  counterpart \nfunding;  (v)  failure  of  the  project  counties  and  cities  to  increase  water,  wastewater,  and  solid-\nwaste tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; and (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement \nissues, which could constrain the efficient implementation of the project works and restoration of \nlivelihoods of the affected persons. \n \n74. \nRisk  (i)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronizing  the  project  design  and  implementation \nschedules with other planned projects in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, which will also have \nspecific  assurances  similar  to  those  covenanted  in  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  proposed \nProject.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  the  provision  of  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment  for  the  IAs  with  the  support  of  consultants.  Risks  (iv)  and  (v)  will  be  mitigated \nthrough covenanted assurances from the project county and city governments on the provision \nof  counterpart  funding  and  regular  tariff  review  and  increases.  Risk  (vi)  will  be  mitigated  by \nstrengthening the internal monitoring and supervision by the two PMOs, project county and city \nPMOs,  and  the  IAs,  and  by  engaging  a  qualified  external  agency  to  monitor  and  evaluate \nresettlement.  Several  other  measures  will  also  help  mitigate  the  project  risks:  (i)  the \nappointment  of  project  implementation  and  monitoring  consultants,  including  environmental \nmonitoring  consultants, \n(iii)  EMP \nenvironmental  management  training,  and  (iv)  specific  assurances  from  the  project  county  and \ncity  governments  that  the  project  leading  group  and  PMOs  are  retained  for  the  entire  loan \nimplementation  period  and  beyond.  Regarding  the  enforcement  of  environmental  laws  and \nregulations,  the  PRC  is  taking  this  very  seriously  and  significant  progress  has  been  made  on \nthis front. Upgrading the State Environmental Protection Agency into the MEP is one example of \nsuch  seriousness.  This  is  a  relatively  small  risk  and  the  policy  dialogue  and  capacity  building \nunder the Project would mitigate it.   \n \n\n(ii)  EMP  monitoring  and  mitigation  arrangements, \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n75. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  PRC  Government,  HPG,  JPG,  and  county \nand  city  governments  provided  the  following  assurances  which  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nLoan and Project Agreements. The full list of assurances is in the Loan and Project Agreements \nand Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nCounterpart  financing.  HPG  and  JPG  will,  and  will  cause  the  concerned \ncounty/city  governments  to,  ensure  that  all  local  cost  financing  including  cash \ninjection  and  equity  contribution  is  provided  for  the  Project  on  a  timely  basis  to \nenable  the  full  and  timely  completion  of  the  Project.

For  some  cities,  drinking \nwater quality still does not comply fully with national standards, e.g., for concentrations of iron \nand magnesium. Pipelines are underdeveloped. Low pressure and supply interruptions are not \nuncommon. Leaks occur frequently because of aging pipelines, which results in unaccounted for \nwater.   \n \n2. \ninadequate and insufficient water supply in Heilongjiang.  \n \n3. \nAccording  to  the  statistical  yearbooks  of  the  project  counties  and  cities,  total  water \nconsumption  (including  domestic  and  industrial  water  consumption)  for  each  county  and  city \nranged from 0.7 million m3 to 2.55 million m3 for 2005 and from 0.9 million m3 to 2.55 million m3 \nfor 2006. The length of water supply network for each project county and city ranged from 23.6 \nkilometers (km) to 58.9 km in 2005 and from 26.2 km to 61 km in 2006. At present, Fujin City \nhas two water treatment plants (WTPs), Tangyuan County and Yanshou County have one WTP, \nand  Tonghe  County  does  not  have  any  water  treatment  facility.  All  project  counties  and  cities \nproposed  one  new  WTP  to  be  built  during  the  period  of  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP),  with \ncapacity  ranging  from  9,500  m3/day  to  20,000  m3/day.  The  proposed  length  of  water  supply \npipelines  to be  built  during  the  11th  FYP  period  in  the  project  counties and  cities  ranges  from \n16.5 km to 39.7 km. \n \n4. \nAs  indicated  in  the  feasibility  study  reports  of  the  water  supply  subprojects  in \nHeilongjiang, the projected quantity of water demand for each project county and city by 2010 \nwill  increase  to  between  19,000  m3/day  and  40,000  m3/day,  with  water  supply  coverage \nbetween 75% and 95% of the total population. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nBecause  of  the  rapid  industrialization  in  recent  years,  water  quality  in  the  SRB  has \ndeteriorated seriously. In 2005, a basin-wide water quality assessment indicated that 34% of the \nmonitored sections within the Songhua River Basin had water quality at or below class V of the \nPRC National Surface Water Quality Standards (GB3838-2002). In low-flow or frozen seasons, \nthis  may  even  increase  to  45%.  The  most  polluted  tributaries  include  the  Hulan,  Anbang, \nNamo\u2019er,  Huifa,  Yinma,  Yitong,  Ashi,  Woken,  and  Mudanjiang  rivers.  Water  quality  in  these \nrivers is at class V, and this has caused significant pollution of the mainstream of the Songhua \nRiver. Some counties and cities still do not have any wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and \nthe untreated wastewater is discharged directly into local rivers which empty into the Songhua \nRiver. The lack of adequate wastewater management degrades local river water quality, poses \nthreats  to  public  health,  and  adversely  affects  the  quality  of  life  and  economic  growth  in \nHeilongjiang and Jilin provinces. Meanwhile, because of the poor water quality in the Songhua \nRiver  and  its  tributaries,  many  counties  and  cities  are  taking  groundwater  or  reservoir  as \ndrinking water sources. The proposed Project provides an integrated plan to improve the water \nsupply and wastewater management in the SRB. \n \n6. \nIn  the  project  counties  and  cities  of  Heilongjiang  province,  the  total  volume  of \nwastewater discharged (including domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater) ranged from \n\nWastewater Management for Heilongjiang and Jilin \n\n  \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n1.65  million  m3  to  154.77  million  m3  in  2006.  The  length  of  the  sewers  in  each  project  county \nand city ranged from 6.1 km to 158.0 km in 2006. Available data indicate that none of the project \ncounties or cities have WWTPs in place, except for Harbin and Qiqihar which have two WWTPs \neach.  During  the  period  of  the  11th  FYP,  all  project  counties  and  cities  proposed  one  new \nWWTP to be built, with treatment capacity ranging from 6,000 m3/day to 100,000 m3/day. The \nlength of the proposed sewage networks ranges from 2.5 km to 48.5 km for the project counties \nand cities. \n \nIn Jilin province, the total volume of wastewater discharged for each project county and \n7. \ncity ranged from 3.36 million m3 to 26.65 million m3 in 2006. The length of sewers in the project \ncounty and cities ranged from 12.8 km to 225.0 km in 2006. None of the project counties and \ncities  has  a  WWTP,  except  for  Gongzhuling  City  which  has  one  plant.  All  the  project  counties \nand  cities  have  plans  to  build  one  or  two  WWTPs  during  the  11th  FYP  period,  with  treatment \ncapacity ranging from 15,000 m3/day to 100,000 m3/day. The length of proposed sewers to be \nbuilt during the same period ranges from 19.4 km to 65.9 km. \n \nRecognizing that adequate environmental protection and pollution controls are essential \n8. \nfor sustainable economic growth, the Heilongjiang and Jilin provincial governments and project \ncounties  and  cities  have  incorporated  environmental  protection  as  a  first  priority  in  their \ndevelopment strategy. In the 11th FYP, both provinces plan to build more wastewater treatment \nplants. As set forth in the 11th FYP for environmental protection of Heilongjiang Province, the \nurban wastewater treatment capacity will be expanded by 1.80 million m3/day, requiring a total \ninvestment  of  CNY5.453  billion  ($790.3  million).  According  to  the  Jilin  provincial  11th  FYP  for \nenvironmental  protection,  the  urban  wastewater  treatment  capacity  will  be  expanded  by  1.845 \nmillion  m3/day;  1,631  km  of  new  sewage  network  will  be  built;  and  491,000  m3/day  of  effluent \nwill be re-used, requiring a total investment of CNY5.965 billion ($864.5 million). \n \n9. \nA  total  of  40  WWTPs  in  Heilongjiang  Province  and  38  in  Jilin  Province  will  be \nconstructed during the 11th FYP period as part of the Songhua River Basin Water Quality and \nPollution Control Management Plan. The feasibility  study reports of each subproject, note that \nthe  projected  quantity  of  wastewater  discharged  from  each  project  county  and  city  in \nHeilongjiang Province by 2010 will range from 9,000 m3/day to 333,000 m3/day and that of Jilin \nProvince  will  range  from  3,000  m3/day  to  31,000  m3/day.  The  proposed  Project  will  help  the \nproject counties in Heilongjiang achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2012. It will also \nhelp the counties and cities in Jilin province achieve a 90% wastewater treatment rate by 2012. \n \nThe proposed WWTPs under the Project will help to (i) reduce pollutant discharge loads \n10. \nsignificantly to the tributaries of Songhua River by intercepting direct discharges of raw sewage \ninto  the  rivers,  (ii)  significantly  improve  the  water  quality  of  the  drinking  water  source  to \ndownstream  counties  and  cities  by  reducing  wastewater  discharge  into  the  river,  (iii)  improve  \nsanitation  and  hygiene  for  urban  residents  by  improving  wastewater  management  in  project \ncounties  and  cities,  and  (iv)  facilitate  local  sustainable  economic  growth  by  water  reuse  and \nimproved water quality in the receiving rivers. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  PRC  is  experiencing  a  fast  increase  in  solid  waste  quantities.  In  2006,  PRC \nsurpassed  the  United  States  as  the  world\u2019s  largest  waste  generator,  and  by  2030,  the  PRC\u2019s \nannual  solid  waste  quantities  will  increase  by  another  150%\u2014growing  from  about  150  million \ntons in 2006 to over 480 million tons in 2030. The social, financial, and environmental impacts of \nthis  growing  waste  stream  are  significant.  By  2004,  a  domestic  solid  waste  collection  service \n\nDomestic Solid Waste Management \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nwas provided to a total population of 12 million people in the urban areas of Jilin Province. Of \nthe estimated 6.1 million tons per year total domestic solid waste generated, 94.6% of the total \nwas properly collected, and only about 17.5% of the total was disposed of properly by sanitary \nlandfills and incineration plants.  \n \n12. \nThere are six sanitary landfills under construction and one operational sanitary landfill in \nJilin  province  with  a  total  treatment  capacity  of  5,210  tons/day  and  a  total  investment  of  \nCNY502.5  million.  The  only  existing  sanitary  landfill  has  a  design  capacity  of  2,600  tons/day. \nOnly five out of 49 counties and cities in Jilin province have sanitary landfills under construction \nor  operation.  Under  the  11th  FYP,  the  proper  disposal  rate  for  the  domestic  solid  waste  will \nincrease  from  17.5%  to  60%  by  the  end  of  2010.  Currently,  about  250  tons/day  of  sludge  is \ngenerated by the water treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants in Jilin province. The \nsludge is disposed of in landfills operated by the municipal water service authorities. \n \n13. \nThe Government started to levy a solid waste disposal fee of about CNY3 to CNY5 per \nhousehold per month in the five major cities of Jilin Province in 2008. Construction of sanitary \nlandfills  and  waste  transfer  stations  is  a  major  undertaking  for  the  government;  the  designed \ntotal capacity of about 2,400 tons/day under the proposed Project accounts for about 14% of the \ntotal  domestic  solid  waste  generated  in  Jilin  province,  and  thus  contributes  significantly  to \npollution controls and the Government\u2019s

The  construction  of  the  Project  will  have  significant  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts. The implementing agencies (IAs) with the support of the respective design \ninstitutes prepared five short resettlement plans, two due diligence reports, and six statements of \nland acquisition and resettlement (LAR)1 for the Heilongjiang component. Three full and 13 short \nresettlement  plans  (one  of  which  had  a  due  diligence  report)  were  prepared  for  the \nsubcomponents for Jilin component. The primary objective of the resettlement plans has been to \nensure that the affected people improve their living standards or are at least not made worse off \nbecause of the Project. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe construction of the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management \nProject  will  affect  287  households  or  1,523  persons  by  permanent  land  acquisition  and  331 \nhouseholds or 1,067 persons by temporary land occupation. The residential and nonresidential \nhouses of 68 households or 238 persons will be demolished. In total, 272.6 hectares (ha) of land \nwill  be  affected  permanently,  33%  of  which  (90.2  ha)  is  cultivated  land;  125.5  ha  of  rural \ncollective  and  state  land  will  be  occupied  temporarily;  and  11,180.6  m2  of  residential  and \nnonresidential structures will be demolished. \n \n \n\nTable A9.1: Summary Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nTotal Area \n(ha/m2) \n\nOf which \nFarmland (ha) \n\nAffected \nHouseholds (no.) \n\nAffected \nPersons (no.) \n\nType of Impact \n\nA.

The demolition of residential structures will lead to the relocation of 14 households \nor 51 persons. In total, 68 ha of land will be affected permanently, 40.4% of which is cultivated \nland; 54.7 ha of rural and state land will be occupied temporarily; and 2,035.6 m2 of residential \n\n                                                 \n1 Statements here refer to the subcomponents that involve state-owned land to be acquired. They do not include land \n\nowned by village committees or farmers\u2019 households that are affected. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\nhouses  will  be  demolished.  For  the  Jilin  component,  the  construction  of  the  proposed \nsubprojects will affect 246 households or 1,374 persons by permanent land acquisition and 169 \nhouseholds or 538 persons by temporary land occupation. Demolition of buildings, including two \nenterprises and two shops, will require the relocation of 54 households or 187 persons. Of the \ntotal  affected  persons,  10  households  or  19  persons  are  from  vulnerable  groups.  In  total,  \n204.6 ha of land will be affected permanently, of which 30.6% is cultivated land; 70.8 ha of rural \ncollective  and  state  land  will  be  occupied  temporarily,  including  31.5%  of  cultivated  land;  and \n9,145  m2  of  houses  will  be  demolished.  In  addition,  associated  productive  assets,  ground \nattachments,  and  basic  infrastructures  and  facilities  will  be  affected  as  result  of  both  the \nHeilongjiang  and  Jilin  components.  In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  there  was  close  consultation  with  the  local  officials  and  village  committees  and \nstreet  committees  during  the  preliminary  and  final  feasibility  study,  and  during  the  preliminary \ndesign stages.  \n \nC. \n \nCompensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \n4. \nPRC  (1998)  and  the  State  Council  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land \nAdministration (Document 28 dated in November 2004). Compensation for house demolition is \nbased  on \nthe  Provincial  and  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolishment  Administration \nRegulations. The resettlement plans comply with PRC laws and regulation of resettlement and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Based  on  consultations  with  local  governments \nand  those  affected,  and  general  practice  in  relevant  counties  or  cities,  a  set  of  compensation \nstandards was adopted by the respective county or city project management offices (PMOs) and \nIAs.  The  resettlement  principles  established  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by  using  alternative \ndesigns;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  are  based  on  replacement  value  and  must  be \nsufficient to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-project standard of living, with the \nprospect  of  improvement;  (iii)  the  amount  of  land  temporarily  occupied  and  the  period  for \ndisruption  are  to  be  kept  to  a  minimum;  (iv)  all  the  people  affected, legal  and  illegal,  are  to be \ntaken into consideration and accounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after land acquisition \nshould  be  sufficient  to  maintain  previous  livelihood  standards;  (vi)  where  land  allocation  per \ncapita  is  not  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood  standards,  other  income-generating \nactivities will be provided for; (vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups with \nregard to compensation, payment of special fund, minimum living guarantee, and employment; \n(viii)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately  informed  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and \nstandards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) close monitoring \nand timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any problems.  \n \nD. \n \n5. \nFor land acquisition, land compensation will be paid in cash to the affected villages to be \nused  for  improving  village  infrastructure  and  farming  conditions.  A  resettlement  subsidy  and \nstanding  crops  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  persons.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential \n(enterprises  and  shops)  houses  to  be  demolished,  compensation  will  be  paid  to  owners, \nincluding  those  without  house  certificates.  The  payment  will  be  made  in  cash  according  to  the \nappraised value of the property. Households that have to relocate will also receive a relocation \nallowance.  Compensation  for  standing  crops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets  will  also  be  paid \ndirectly  to  the  affected  persons.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced  production  sales  and \nwages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. \n \n\nCompensation, Income, and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\nsmall-scale \n\nThe  measures \n\nfor  economic  rehabilitation \n\nsalons,  dry-cleaning  businesses, \n\n55 \n \nThe  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  (i)  the  replacement  of  housing,  and  (ii)  the \n6. \nrestoration  of  livelihoods  and  income.  For  people  losing  housing  in  rural  areas,  there  are  two \nresettlement  options\u2014to  receive  cash  compensation  or  cash  compensation  plus  provision  of \nhouse plot for house construction by  themselves. Assistance will be provided to enable affected \npersons to construct new houses or find available housing close to their original homes, if that is \ntheir  preference.  The  respective  county  or  city  PMOs,  IAs  and  local  governments  will  provide \nassistance for house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. \n \ninclude:  (i)  provision  of  employment \n7. \nopportunities during construction and operational phases; (ii) provision of basic social insurance \nto  affected  persons  whose  land  is  newly  acquired;  (iii)  development  of  economic  crops  with \nhigher  economic  value;  (iv)  promotion  and  development  of  new  enterprises  and  self-employed \nsecondary  and  tertiary  businesses  (e.g.,  auto  accessory  manufacturing  plants,  community \nservices,  hairdressing \nsupermarkets, \ntransportation, entertainment and catering services); and (v) provision of technical training to the \naffected persons to increase their skills.  \n \n8. \nThe survey results indicate that nine households and 28 persons are vulnerable people \naffected  by  construction  of  four  subprojects  in  Jilin  Province.  For  these  vulnerable  people,  the \nrespective  municipal  PMOs  and  IAs  will  establish  a  special  assistance  one-time  payment  of \nCNY2,000  per  capita  for  them  to  improve  their  living  standards.  In  addition,  the  vulnerable \nhouseholds will be provided with additional assistance for their relocation and rehabilitation. The \nPMO and IA will supervise implementation to ensure these vulnerable persons receive adequate \ncompensation,  housing  arrangements,  special  assistance  payments  and \nlivelihood \narrangements, and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n \nE. \n \nThe people affected were notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan before \n9. \nADB  loan  fact-finding.  On  various  occasions  during  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local \nrepresentatives  and  affected  persons  have  participated  in  the  planning  process  and  their \nconcerns have been integrated into the resettlement plans. The resettlement information booklet \nfor  each  subproject  has  been  distributed  to  affected  villages  and  households.  The  final \nresettlement plans have been provided to village offices and resident committees and posted on \nthe  ADB  website  on  28  July  2008.  The  project  IAs  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  to \nsupervise implementation, continuing public consultation, monitoring progress and responding to \ngrievances.  The  grievance  address  procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nEach PMO will have at least one person and each IA will have at least two full-time staff \nresponsible  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Staff  from  each  subproject  resettlement  unit \nwill take the lead in coordinating the planning, implementation, financing, and monitoring of land \nacquisition and resettlement. They will work closely with village officials, land resource bureaus \nand  house  demolition  administration  offices,  and  will  be  responsible  for  supervision  and \nmonitoring  of  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration of incomes, provision of replacement land and other economic measures). A training \nprogram will be organized for the resettlement officers.  \n \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n\nInstitutional Arrangement and implementation Schedule \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ntaxes, \n\nBudget \n\nG. \n \n11. \nThe total costs for the LAR are estimated at CNY238.1 million ($34 million), including a \ncontingency.  Of  the  total  LAR  costs,  CNY46.0  million  ($6.6  million)  is  for  the  Heilongjiang \ncomponent  and  CNY192.1  million  ($27.4  million)  for  the  Jilin  component.  The  estimated  costs \ninclude compensation for permanent land acquisition, temporary land occupation, demolition of \nresidential houses and auxiliaries, relocation allowance, basic infrastructure and special facilities, \nland-related \ntraining,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  contingency  and  other  costs.  \nResettlement  implementation  will  precede  construction  schedules.  Most  resettlement  activities \nwill  occur  between  February  2008  and  December  2009.    Resettlement  implementation  will  be \ncompleted  before  subproject  construction.  Detailed  measurement  surveys  will  be  conducted  in \neach  village,  neighborhood,  enterprise,  and  shop,  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be \nnegotiated  and  signed  with  village  committees,  households  and  enterprises.  Based  on  these \nsurveys, the resettlement plans will be updated and submitted to ADB for review and approval \nbefore commencement of construction activities if there are changes to the scope of the LAR or \npolicies. \n \nH. \n \n12. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  plan  implementation  will  be  conducted. \nMonitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement  plans.  Internal  supervision  and \nmonitoring will be done by each IA to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement \nplan.  The  PMO  and  IAs  have  agreed  to  a  set  of  supervision  milestones  with  ADB,  to  ensure \ntimely and effective implementation of resettlement activities. External monitoring and evaluation \nwill be carried out by an independent agency under contract to the PMO of Heilongjiang and Jilin \nprovince.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  be  prepared  every  6  months  during \nimplementation  and  annually  for  2  years  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  External \nmonitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMOs, IAs, and ADB and will be uploaded on \nADB website. \n \n \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n57 \n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\nProject Loan \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nEast Asia Department, Social \nSectors Division \n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n\n \nThe  Songhua  River  is  a  crucial  watershed  and  priority  development  and  environmental  zone  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC) Government, as noted in the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP). The Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and \nManagement Project (SRBWPCMP)  will improve  environmental  quality  in the SRB and enhance the quality  of life for 9.94 \nmillion people in the participating counties and cities of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces. The Project is consistent  with the \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  water  policy.  It  will  help  the  PRC  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  of \nenvironmental  sustainability  (MDG  Goal  7),  and  specifically  address  MDG  Target  10  (to  halve  the  proportion  of  people \nwithout  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015).  The  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  in  the  PRC  to  make  markets  work  more  efficiently  through  (i)  urban  infrastructure  development,  (ii) \npromotion of environmental sustainability, and (iii) pro-poor equitable and inclusive growth. The Project is consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s priorities in the 11th FYP of addressing environmental issues including water and air pollution. \n\n \nThe SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC after the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. It has a catchment area of 556,800 \nsquare kilometers (km2) and serves a population of approximately 62 million. The urbanization rate for the area is relatively \nhigh, with 50% of the population living in counties and cities of SRB. The SRBWPCMP will improve water pollution control \nand drinking water sources in the SRB through the provision of clean and stable water supplies, wastewater and solid waste \nmanagement  and  integrated  river  rehabilitation.  It  will  upgrade  the  urban  environment  in  the  project  counties  and  cities  of \nHeilongjiang  and  Jilin  provinces.  In  turn,  it  will  also  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction  directly  and \nindirectly in the project areas by promoting:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n\nimproved urban environmental conditions and enhanced sanitation through pollution control in the SRB;  \nincreased  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities,  including  temporary  job  creation  during  the \nconstruction phase and permanent job creation during the operational phase;  \nincreased environmental awareness and public hygiene;  \nreduction  in  the  incidence  of  water-,  vector-  and  air-borne  diseases,  with  associated  reductions  in  medical \ncosts, and in the number of workdays and school days lost;  \nincreased yields and values of irrigated crops, fishery and animal husbandry;  \nreduced risks of pollution to downstream water users;  \nvalue-added benefits from using local procurement to the extent possible;  \nimproved investment conditions  to stimulate the development of local  economy, create  new  jobs  and income \ngenerating opportunities and accelerate the rehabilitation of the ecological system of the Project counties and \ncities;  \naccelerated development of the tourism industry in the project counties and cities;  \nincreased land and property values for local residents in the Project areas; and, \nprovision of low-cost water for industrial uses which in turn could reduce the price of associated products.  \n\n \nEnvironmental and socioeconomic benefits will accrue to the local populations in the SRB, thus enhancing their quality of life \nand health. Benefits  will  be felt especially  by the poor  who are  most vulnerable to environment-related diseases and poor \nurban environments. Vulnerable populations and women will be particularly targeted for employment opportunities generated \nby the project investments. The Project will complement the PRC\u2019s efforts to ensure environmental sustainability and reduce \nurban poverty. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                       Targeting Classification:  Targeted intervention (M7 T10)   \n1.  Key Issues \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  MDG-TI.  It  directly  addresses  MDG  7  to  ensure  environmental  sustainability  and  particularly \nTarget 10 to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \nIt  will benefit  more than 9.94 million urban residents in the  project areas of SRB, of  whom 6.85% or 680,890 persons are \npoor and currently living under the minimum living guarantee (MLG) which ranges from CNY145 to CNY245 per capita per \nmonth  in  Heilongjiang  Province  and  from  CNY100  to  CNY143  per  capita  per  month  in  Jilin  Province.  The  social  analysis \nrevealed that these poor are mostly living in areas without running water supplies, wastewater and solid waste collection and \ntreatment  services.  They  often  suffer  from  serious  water  supply  shortages,  poor  water  quality,  wastewater  pollution,  and \npoor urban environmental sanitation. They have less capacity to cope with the pollution and degraded environments and in \nturn  suffer  from  increased  exposure  and  risks  to  surface  and  ground  water  and  air  pollution,  which  further  add  to  their \npoverty. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nThrough  the  provision  of  clean  and  stable  water  supply  and  wastewater  management,  solid  waste  management,  and \nintegrated river rehabilitation  components in the project counties and cities, the Project  will improve the living  environment \nand health status of the local urban residents. The Project is consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities in the 11th FYP of \naddressing environmental issues, including water and air pollution. The poor who are most vulnerable to environment-related \ndiseases  and  poor  urban  environments  and  lack  of  financial  resources  will  receive  environmental  and  socioeconomic \nbenefits from the Project. They will particularly benefit from the targeted employment opportunities. \n2. Design Features \nThe  designs  for  all  subprojects  have  attempted  to  reduce  impacts  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  resettlement \nplans,  in  consultation  with  local  communities,  have  outlined  and  agreed  upon  the  mitigation  plans.  Project  assurances \nensure  targets  for  employment  of  local  labor,  especially  the  poor,  women,  and  ethnic  minorities  (20%).  The  Social  Action \nPlans (SAPs) outline strategies for mitigating adverse impacts and promoting positive benefits such as employment, initiating \ncommunity-based environmental and hygiene awareness programs and ensuring HIV/AIDS awareness training is carried out \nby contractors. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe Project will directly benefit more than 9.94 million urban residents in the project areas of the SRB (including 7.04 million \nurban residents in the direct project area (DPA) of Heilongjiang province and 2.9 million urban residents in the DPA of Jilin \nprovince). Of the total beneficiary populations, about 48% are women, 6.85% (4.62% in Heilongjiang Province, and 12.24% \nin Jilin Province) are classified as poor based on the weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY183 per month, and \n4.1% are members of ethnic minorities scattered across the project counties and cities. \n \nHealth Benefits. The implementation of the Project will lead to an improvement in the clean water supply and in wastewater \nand solid waste collection and treatment. It will contribute to a reduction in morbidity and mortality rates from water-, vector- \nand airborne diseases and contribute to savings in associated medical costs and the loss of healthy working days. Health is \noften  both  a  cause  and  a  result  of  poverty.  Health  sector  studies  in  the  PRC  have  shown  that  infectious  and  parasitic \ndiseases  particularly  afflict  the  poor.  The  poorest  quintile  suffers  three  times  the  infectious  disease  rate  of  the  wealthiest \nquartile. As the poor are often elderly and disabled, they are more susceptible to diseases and have less financial capability \nto  cope  with  the  costs  associated  with  them.  A  public  environment  and  hygiene  awareness  program  in  parallel  with  the \nexisting environment and health programmes and close coordination with the environmental protection bureaus and health \nbureaus in the project counties and cities will be carried out during the implementation of the Project.  \n \nEmployment Benefits. The Project will create 6,620 person-years of direct short-term employment during the construction \nphase  and  1,380  direct  long-term  jobs  during  the  operation  phase.  Based  on  discussions  with  the  implementing  agencies \n(IAs), it has been agreed that, of the total employment generated, a target of 30% short-term employment opportunities will \nbe filled by the poor and minorities (15%) and women (15%) during the construction phase (earning CNY26.74 million) and \nlong-term employment opportunities during the operation phase (earning CNY5.52 million) will be adopted. These jobs are \nmost likely to be filled by currently laid-off or unemployed persons, meaning that the poor will particularly benefit from this job \ncreation.  \n \nAffordability.  The  affordability  assessment  indicates  that  the  average  households  and  households  in  the  lowest  income \nclass will not be adversely affected by the tariff increase since the share of income expended on the service is below 5% of \ntheir total income. The impact on households in the lowest income bracket can be potentially significant but will be mitigated \nthrough the existing tariff reduction and subsidy program. These subsidies are in addition to the minimum living guarantee. \nThe  results  of  the  focus  group  discussion  for  the  poor  groups  indicate  that  the  poor  households  support  the  improved \nservices if they can afford the tariff increase.  \n \nEthnic Minorities. Ethnic minorities represent a small percentage of the total population (4.1%) and are scattered across the \nproject  counties  and  cities.  The  social  analysis  determined  that  they  are  socially  and  economically  integrated  with  the \nmajority population and will not be subject to any adverse impacts of the Project as a result of their minority status, including \nland acquisition and resettlement. Priority will be given to them for employment. \n \nIn addition, improved health and quality of life will improve the human capital and promote local economic development. The \ncurrent  loss  of  agricultural,  fishery  and  animal  husbandry  production  and  lower  prices  of  agricultural,  fishery  and  animal \nhusbandry  products  can  be  mitigated  through  the  improved  quality  of  water.  The  improved  water  quality  and  urban \nenvironment  will  promote  sustainable  economic  development  and  accelerate  the  development  of  tourism.  The  poor  and \nwomen are particularly likely to find opportunities in this industry. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n59 \n \n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. The technical assistance (TA) used various participatory methods for poverty and social impact assessment, including a \nrandom  sampling  socioeconomic  survey  of  1,000  respondents  in  both  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  provinces,  stakeholder \nconsultation  workshops,  meetings,  seminars,  focus  group  discussions,  and  key  informant  interviews  on  issues  related  to \nprevention  and  control  of  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  solid  waste  management,  and  integrated  river \nrehabilitation  subcomponents.  Development  of  the  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) involved two rounds of public consultation. Separate socioeconomic surveys, community meetings, \nopinion surveys and specific impact studies were conducted for the resettlement plans. The EMP and resettlement plans set \nout detailed ongoing public participation plans.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing       \n\n Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nPublic disclosure of all project documents at the PMO and on the ADB website including the project information document \n(PID),  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF),  resettlement  plans,  SEIA,  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President \n(RRP),  public  sector  legal  agreement,  project  administration  memorandum  (PAM),  social  and  environmental  monitoring \nreports  are  available  or  will  be  available  after  approval.  A  PID  has  been  prepared  for  each  subproject.  Resettlement \ninformation  booklets  outlining  the  resettlement  plans  have  been  distributed  to  each  affected  household  and  disclosure \nmeetings  have  been  held.  Copies  of  the  booklets  have  been  available  at  the  respective  PMO  offices,  and  each  affected \nvillage office. To enhance the environmental and health benefits of the Project, a public environment and hygiene awareness \nprogram in the communities in parallel with the existing environment and health programmes and in close coordination with \nthe  environmental  protection  bureaus  and  health  bureaus  in  the  project  counties  and  cities  will  be  carried  out  during \nimplementation.  \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \nResults from the household survey and focus group discussion indicate that women are primarily responsible for collection of \nhousehold  water,  wastewater  disposal  and  management,  household  garbage  disposal  and  management,  and  care  for  the \nsick and elderly. Time and efforts spent on these activities will be significantly reduced, enabling women to be engaged in \nincome-generating activities and family or leisure time. Lack of water supply, wastewater disposal and collection, and solid \nwaste  disposal  and  collection  contribute  to  gender  inequities  and  add  to  the  burden  of  household  work.  The  poverty  and \nsocial assessment indicates that women strongly support the Project across all of the subprojects. Women have perceived \nthat the Project will improve their living environments, create employment opportunities, and reduce the incidence of water-, \nvector- and airborne diseases. \n \n2.  Key Actions \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n   Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nProject  assurances  prioritize  women  for  employment  and  skills  training.  Of  the  total  employment  generated,  a  15%  target \nhas been set for women during the project construction and operation phases. This has been agreed to by the IAs and will \nbe monitored by the Project. Job training will be provided at the beginning of their employment. Core labor standards and an  \nHIV/AIDS awareness training are included for all contractors in the loan assurances. The community-based environmental \nand hygiene awareness program will directly address women\u2019s needs and health risks. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nIssue \nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \nSignificant \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n Full Plan \n Short Plan \n Resettlement \n\nFramework \n\n No Action \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nA resettlement plan for each \nsubproject has been prepared in \naccordance with the PRC laws and \nregulations and ADB policy.a The \nresettlement plans will be \ndistributed to the affected people \nand the public. Internal and \nexternal monitoring arrangements \nwill be put into place. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \nIssue \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \nNo Impact \n\nLabor \n\n \n\n Employment opportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \n\nSignificant \n\nAffordability \n\nLimited \n\nNo Impact \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers (conflict, political \n\ninstability, etc), please \nspecify \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n Plan \n Other Action \n Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n No Action \n\n Action \n Other Action \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n No Action \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \nEthnic minorities represent a small \npercentage of the total population \n(4.1%) scattered across the project \ncounties and cities. The social \nanalysis determined they are fully \nintegrated into the majority \npopulation, with similar customs \nand socioeconomic activities. \nPriority will be given to them for \nemployment generated by the \nProject in the loan assurance. \nThe Project will provide 6,620 full-\ntime employment opportunities \nduring construction and 1,380 full-\ntime jobs during the operation \nphase. Project assurances will \nensure that all employment and \ncore labor standards as provided in \nthe applicable laws and regulations \nare complied with. Assurances \naddress: core labor standards and \nprioritize local labor basic training \nand skill promotion. \nThe affordability of services by the \npoor has been assessed based on \nthe proposed tariffs and household \nincome data. For average \nhouseholds and households in the \nlowest income class the share of \nincome expended for the services \nwill be below the 5% benchmark. \nImpacts on households in the \nlowest income class may be \nsignificant but will be mitigated \nthrough the existing tariff reduction \nand subsidy program provided by \nthe respective local government. \nThe project construction workers \nwill be engaged locally. HIV/AIDS \ntraining and sensitization will be \nprovided to the contractors, \nensured in the loan assurances \nand monitored in the social action \nplans. No other social risks and/or \nvulnerability are also anticipated as \na result of the Project, except for \nthe resettlement and land \nacquisition addressed in the \nresettlement plans.  \n \n\nIV.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?  \n   Yes     \na    A  total  of  three  full  RPs  and  18  short  RPs  with  three  due-diligence  reports,  and  six  statements  of  land  acquisition  and \n\n   No      \n\nresettlement have been prepared. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n61 \n \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nFinancial  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Financial  Management  and \n1. \nAnalysis of Projects (2005) of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB). Cost estimates were made \nin  domestic  currency  units,  with  foreign  exchange  costs  converted  into  yuan  at  the  projected \npurchasing  power  parity  exchange  rate,  taking  into  consideration  the  potential  impacts  of \ninternational and domestic inflation. Taxes and duties have been disclosed as part of the base \ncosts. The projected financial statements for each subproject were prepared in current terms for \nthe  period  2008  to  2017  to  cover  the  construction  period  and  several  years  of  commercial \noperation.  Construction  is  assumed  to  be  completed  in  about  4  years  for  each  subproject, \nfollowed by a year of trial operations.   \n \n2. \nAn assessment of the financial management capability of the executing agencies (EAs) \nand implementing agencies (IAs) of each subproject was made. The EAs have sound financial \nmanagement  systems  and  adequate  experience  of  managing  projects  funded  by  foreign \nfinancial institutions. The IAs operate as state-owned enterprises. The accounting and financial \nmanagement  systems  of  IAs  for  financial  reporting  and  accounting  were  adequate  for  loan \nimplementation, although there is potential to improve internal control procedures. As some of \nthe IAs may have no experience of externally funded projects, training on ADB procedures and \nrequirements  related  to  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  reporting,  monitoring,  internal \ncontrol, and anticorruption safeguards will need to be provided under the Project.  \n \nB.  \n\nFinancial Forecast \n\n \n \nBased  on  previous  financial  statements,  financial  models  were  developed  for  all  of  the \n3. \nsubprojects  to  assess  their  current  financial  situation  and  to  forecast  their  performance  during \nthe construction period and up to several years of operations. The major assumptions used to \ncalculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) were: (i) all calculations are made in 2008 \nprices;  (ii)  capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the  construction \nand  purchase  of  equipment  under  the  project,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest \nduring  construction;  (iii)  operating  and  maintaining  costs  include  all  annual  incremental \nexpenses  incurred  in  operating  the  facilities,  but  exclude  depreciation  and  debt  repayment \nprovisions;  and  (iv)  operating  revenues  from  tariffs  used  in  the  financial  projections  are  also \nadjusted  to  2008  prices.  Overall,  the  FIRR  for  the  water  supply  subprojects  computed  on  an \nafter-tax basis is 7.6% and 6.7% for wastewater subprojects.  \n \n\n2.   Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) \n \n4. \nThe WACC has been calculated in real terms for each subproject. Funding sources are \nthe  ADB  loan,  counterpart  funds  from  the  Government,  and  state  bonds.  In  addition  to  these \nsources, domestic loans will also be used to finance selected water supply subprojects. For the \nADB  loan,  the  applicable  10-year  fixed  swap  rate  plus  a  provision  for  ADB\u2019s  spread  of  0.20% \nwas used. An estimated interest cost of 7.8% per annum was used for the domestic loan funds, \nwhile the opportunity cost of equity and state bonds was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt \nwas also adjusted to reflect the impact of income taxes of 25%. \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n \n1. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nItem\n\nADB Loan\n\nEquity\n\nTotal\n\nTable A11: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nFinancing Component\nDomestic \nLoan\n\nGovernment\n\n396.33\n100.00\n\nAmount in ($ million)\n\n0.29\n0.07\n7.80\n25.00\n5.85\n5.00\n0.81\n0.00\n\n200.00\n50.46\n4.87\n25.00\n3.65\n0.80\n2.83\n1.43\n\n189.16\n47.73\n8.00\n0.00\n8.00\n5.00\n2.86\n1.36\n\nNominal Cost (%)\nTax Rate (%)\nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost (%)\nInflation Rate (%)\n\nA.\nB.

The  subprojects  are  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable. \nSensitivity  tests  were  conducted  under  various  adverse  conditions  that  would  cause  the \nsubprojects\u2019 FIRR to fall below the WACC. The results of the sensitivity tests indicate that these \nconditions are unlikely to occur.  \n \n\n6.88\n1.74\n8.00\n0.00\n8.00\n5.00\n2.86\n0.05\n\n2.84\n\n \n\nProjected Tariffs  \n\n3.  \n \n6. \nThe existing tariff will be reviewed and increased gradually to a level that will ensure full \ncost  recovery.  The  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  tariffs  will  be \nincreased periodically during the implementation period through the Government\u2019s consultative \nprocess, including public hearing and assessment of affordability for domestic users, especially \nfor low-income households. In addition, the IAs will take measures to improve their operations to \naddress  system  losses  and  nonrevenue  water,  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  collection. \nImplementation of these measures will be appropriately covenanted.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12        63 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nPolicies, Targets, Rationale, and Tariffs \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Songhua  River  Basin  (SRB)  is  seriously  polluted  and  is  acknowledged  by  the \n1. \nMinistry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP)  to  be  one  of  the  four  most  polluted  river  basins  in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Water pollution issues in the SRB, especially in relation \nto  the  protection  of  drinking  water  resources  for  the  municipality  of  Harbin,  have  received \nincreased national and international attention due to a widely publicized pollution incident in the \nSRB in November and December 2005. The Songhua River is contaminated with a number of \nknown  and  suspected  trace  organic  chemicals,  metals,  and  conventional  pollutants,  and  is \nclassified  by  the  Government  as  class  IV1  (falling  below  class  V  during  the  6-month  low-flow \nwinter season), and is considered unsuitable for municipal domestic water use.  \n \n2. \nIn 2006, with the approval of the State Council, the SRB Water Pollution Prevention and \nControl Master Plan (SRBPCMP) was released by the MEP. A total of 40 wastewater treatment \nplants (WWTPs) will be constructed in Heilongjiang province and 38 in Jilin province during the \n11th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP)  period  as  part  of  the  SRBPCMP.  Recognizing  that  adequate \nenvironmental  protection  and  pollution  controls are  essential  for  sustainable  economic  growth, \nthe  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  provincial  governments  and  project  counties  and  cities  have  made \nenvironmental protection one of the main priorities in their development  strategies. In the 11th \nFYP, both provinces plan to build more WWTPs. As set forth in the 11th FYP for environmental \nprotection of Heilongjiang province, the urban wastewater treatment capacity will be expanded \nby  1.80  million  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day)  requiring  a  total  investment  of  CNY5.453  billion \n($790.3  million).  According  to  the  Jilin  provincial  11th  FYP  for  environmental  protection,  the \nurban wastewater treatment capacity will be expanded by 1.845 million m3/day; 1,631 kilometers \n(km)  of  new  sewage  network  will  be  built;  and  491,000  m3/day  of  effluent  will  be  re-utilized, \nrequiring a total investment of CNY5.965 billion ($864.5 million). \n \n3. \nIn  theory,  market  mechanisms  such  as  permits  and  taxes  can  be  used  to  control \nemissions  efficiently.  However,  in  the  water  and  solid  waste  sectors,  neither  a  tradable  permit \nsystem nor a pollution tax attain the least-cost solution in the way that theory suggests, because \nof regulated firms\u2019 strategic behavior, regulatory capture, and asymmetric information (between \nthe regulator and the firms). Limited private sector investment is expected since the cost-based \npricing rule will be used in utility sectors, given the pressure on the Government from inflation  \nand the need to ensure distributional justice. The investment by this project will not crowd out \nprofit-driven private sector investments.  \n \nAs  for  tariff  reform,  in  addition  to  the  goals  of  safe  and  affordable  water  for  all  and \n4. \nmaximum net social benefits, there are several key criteria, such as financial sustainability, the \nuser  pays  principle,  simplicity,  and  transparency. Typically,  water  supply,  wastewater  and  solid \nwaste  sectors  are  only  covered  from  their  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  and  a \nfraction  of  capital  costs.  Historical  tariffs  were  often  established  by  price  bureaus  in  a  political \nprocess that has resulted in insufficient revenues and a need for subsidies from the municipality. \nThere  are  at  least  four  reasons  for  a  periodic  review  and  gradual  increase  in  tariffs:  \n(i)  mandatory  public  hearings,  (ii)  ensuring  a  good  tariff  collection  rate,  (iii)  higher  tariffs  for \nresidential  users  to  eliminate  the  industry  to  household  cross-subsidy  eventually,  and  (iv)  a \nreasonable  level  of  profitability  for  the  utility  companies  in  order  to  encourage  private \n\n                                                 \n1  The  PRC  water  quality  standards  have  five  classes  of  quality  covering  about  40  pollution  parameters.  Class  I  is \n\npristine, while class V is suitable only for industrial use.   \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nDemand Forecast and Least Cost Analysis \n\nparticipation. The concern with distributional justice should not be a problem, since even under \nthe most stringent circumstances, the average household would pay 1.5% to 2.9% of income for \nservices, while the poor household would pay only 2.2% to 3.6%.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nA  demand  forecast  for  each  subproject  was  carried  out  by  the  Executing Agency  (EA) \nand  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants.  This  concluded  that  the \nrisk associated with the demand forecast is minimal because the project\u2019s supply will be lower \nthan  the  total  demands  for  water  supplies  and  wastewater  treatment  services  in  the  six  cities \nand five counties2 in Heilongjiang province. \n \nTwo methods, lowest average incremental economic cost (AIEC) and net present value \n6. \neconomic  cost  (NPVEC),  are  applied  in  the  least-cost  analysis  for  Heilongjiang  province.  All \ncosts  and  outputs  are  derived  from  a  with-project  and  without-project  comparison,  and \ndiscounted  at  the  economic  discount  rate  of  12%.  The  NPVEC  equalizes  net  present  value \nincluding incremental capital investment costs and O&M costs, and the AIEC is the net present \nvalue  of  incremental  capital  investment  costs  and  O&M  costs  divided  by  the  present  value  of \nincremental output. For water sources comparison, the ground water source is found to be more \ncost-effective  than  the  surface  water  option.  For  the  wastewater  treatment  process  for  Harbin \nCity Xinyigou District WWTP, it is concluded that the A2O process is the best process. However, \nfor the Qiqihar City WWTP, the CASS process is found to be more cost-effective than the A2O \nprocess.  \n\n \n\nGeneral Parameters \n\nLeast-cost analyses of the Jilin component confirm the proposed technologies and sites \n7. \nare  the  least-cost  options.  For  example,  in  several  of  the  WWTP  subprojects,  Biolak  and A2O \ntechnologies were compared. Using the equalizing discount rate approach, it is found that the \nBiolak option always has a lower discounted cost stream between 4% and 15% discount rate. In \nproject  site  selection,  all  subprojects  carefully  selected  the  sites  with  lowest  land  acquisition \ncost, treatment cost, and negative spillovers for local residents. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe economic analysis is on a 25-year basis inclusive of the project construction period. \nEconomic  benefits  and  costs  are  denoted  in  terms  of  the  domestic  price  numeraire  and \nexpressed in constant 2007 prices. International costs are converted to local currency costs at \nan exchange rate of CNY7.0 per $1, and are adjusted annually based on a purchasing power \nparity assumption. Project costs and benefits are estimated on a without- and with-project basis \nappropriately  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  nonincremental  and  incremental  project  effects  in \naccordance  with  the ADB  Guidelines  for  the  Economic Analysis  of  Projects  and  Handbook  for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects.  Tradable  components  are  adjusted  to \neconomic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.013, and nontraded components are \nvalued at domestic market prices.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nBase costs plus physical contingencies of the Project and each of the subproject capital \ncosts  have  been  estimated  and  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  tradable,  nontradable,  and  skilled \nand unskilled labor costs. Similarly, O&M costs for each subproject and the overall Project are \n                                                 \n2  The  six  cities  are  Fujin,  Harbin,  Jiamusi,  Qiqihar,  Qitaihe,  and  Shuangyashan.  The  five  counties  are  Fangzheng, \n\nCosts \n\nNenjiang, Tonghe, Yanshou, and Tangyuan. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12        65 \n\nProject Benefits \n\nestimated, apportioned on the basis of tradable and nontradable works, consumables, services, \nequipment  and  machinery,  and  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  valued  in  economic  prices,  i.e., \nshadow  wage  rate  factors.  Additional  conversion  factors  are  used  when  necessary  and \nappropriate.3 Domestic transfer payments are excluded in the valuation of the cost estimates in \neconomic prices. Physical contingencies are added to capital costs. \n \nE. \n \nThe  monitoring  results  and  water  pollution  episodes  strongly  suggest  serious  water \n10. \npollution damage in SRB. Previous research and field investigations by the consultants suggest \nthat  there  are  three  broad  categories  of  water  pollution  damage:  damage  to  public  health; \ndamage to the surrounding ecosystems including agriculture and fisheries; and other damage, \nincluding to industrial production and residential property values. The project\u2019s primary benefits \nfor water-related subprojects include the following.   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nPublic  health  benefits.  These  may  include  reduced  incidence  of  cancer, \ndiarrhea, and respiratory ailments.  \nAgricultural,  aquacultural,  and  husbandry  benefits.  Use  of  sewage  or \npolluted  water  for  irrigation  leads  to lower  production  and  lower  product  quality; \nuse of polluted grain as food or animal fodder results in damage to health. \nIndustry  cost  savings.  There  will  be  less  need  to  treat  polluted  water,  and \nproduct quality will improve. \nIndustrial  water  shortages.  Water  pollution  directly  influences  the  quality  of \nsome industrial products, so a better water supply leads to economic benefits.  \nindustrial \nIndustrial  relocation  cost  savings.  Assuming  enforcement  of \npollution  abatement  standards,  fewer  industrial  facilities  would  have  to  relocate \nbecause of the cost of constructing on-site treatment facilities to achieve effluent \ndischarge standards.  \nFactory resource cost savings. A better centralized wastewater collection and \ntreatment system will lead to savings in on-site treatment costs by industry. \nLand  and  property  value  increases.  The  provision  of  wastewater  collection \nservices to existing and future residential areas within the project area will greatly \nincrease the value of these properties. \n\nThe categories and components of the economic costs are summarized in Table A12.1.  \n\n \n11. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3 A standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used.  Border prices were used for all imported items, 2.0 for skilled labor, \nand 0.67 for unskilled labor.  Taxes and duties were excluded.

Solid  waste  disposal  and  management  projects  are  primarily  concerned  with \nenvironmental health hazards created by the lack of waste collection services in less developed \nareas or the inappropriate handling of solid waste at landfill sites. Landfills in most municipalities \nand  townships  within  the  SRB  urgently  need  to  be  expanded  or  new  landfills  need  to  be \nestablished  at  other  locations.  Most  existing  landfill  facilities  are  already  operating  beyond  the \nfull capacity and are located in areas with large populations. The suggested alternatives in the \nFSRs  will  meet  sanitary  standards  as  the  best  alternative,  based  on  environmental  impact \nconsiderations.  Both  the  WTP  approach  and  direct  environmental  benefit  valuation  approach \nyield sufficiently high economic return to justify the subprojects. The benefits of the solid waste \nprojects are listed in Table A12.2.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12        67 \n\n \n\nCategory \nHealth effects from \ngroundwater pollution  \n\nAgricultural effects from air \npollution  \n\nVisual and odor \ndisamenity  \nGlobal warming  \n\nTable A12.2: Economic Benefits of Solid Waste Management \n\nImpacts and Unit Values \n(CNY) \n\nAggregate Economic Value \n(CNY/annum) \n\nRestricted Activity Days 225,  \nYOLL acute effects 465,000,  \nYOLL chronic effects 252,000 ECU  \nDamage costs via:  \nSO2 0.00042 CNY/ton of MSW  \nNO 0.3587 CNY/ ton of MSW  \nNumber of affected households: 400,000 hh  \nAverage Impact: CNY 100 hh/year  \nExternal valuation for 1 tonne CO2: $3.6   \n\nMortality: 16,505,000  \nMorbidity: 9,134,800  \n\nAgricultural damage: 301,500 \n\nDisamenity value: \u2245 40 million \n\nGlobal warming damage: $1,959,200 \n(or CNY13,714,000) \n\n \n\n \n\nCNY79,655,300 per annum \nTotal Monetary Costs  \nCO2 = carbon  dioxide, hh = households, MSW = municipal solid  waste, NO = nitrogen  oxide, SO2 = sulfur dioxide, \nYOLL = years of life lost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIn  the  current  study,  to  avoid  possible  double  counting,  land  and  property  value \n13. \nappreciation is not included in the quantification because visual and odor disamenity reduction \nis added. Note further that the average disamenity value per household is assumed at CNY100 \nper  year,  which  is  very  conservative  (in  studies  on  developed  countries,  it  can  be  over  \u20ac300). \nNevertheless, the aggregate disamenity reduction value is still quite high because of the large \nnumber of affected households.   \n \n14. \nThe demand forecast is in line with the empirical research on the relationship between \nsolid waste growth and gross domestic product (GDP) growth,4 which has found that for every \n1% increase in GDP, there is a 0.4056% increase in solid waste. This study showed that there is \na unilateral casual relationship between GDP growth and solid waste growth in the PRC.  \n \nF. \n \n15. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Heilongjiang component is calculated \nfor each subproject and for the whole component. The EIRR calculation takes into account only \nthe  main  benefits  of  different  components  but  includes  all  project-related  costs.5  For  the \nsubprojects,  this  approach  yields  EIRRs  that  range  from  13.6%  to  36.9%.  For  the  whole \ncomponent, the EIRR is 19.6%. For the Heilongjiang component, sensitivity analysis shows that \nthe  EIRR  will  decrease  to  (i)  17.5%  if  the  whole  project  experiences  a  capital  cost  overrun  of \n10%; (ii) 15.0% if the benefits are reduced by 10%; (iii) 17.1% if the commissioning year of the \nProject is delayed by one year; (iv) 11.5% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen.

However, if \nthe WTP is used, health benefits should be removed from the benefits, partly to avoid double counting, unless the \nWTP does not cover positive externality effects of the health benefits. To be conservative, the calculation analysis \ndid not include health benefits because the WTP was used in all the components whenever it is applicable.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.3: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return (Heilongjiang Subprojects) \nEIRR (%)\n28.0 \n14.5 \n17.4 \n15.6 \n15.2 \n19.2 \n14.1 \n34.7 \n25.7 \n36.9 \n15.7 \n14.2 \n13.6 \n19.6 \n\nSubprojects \nFujin City Water Supply Expansion \nTangyuan County Water Supply \nTonghe County Water Supply Expansion \nYanshou County Water Supply Expansion \nFangzheng County WWTP + Sewerage Network \nFujin City WWTP \nHarbin City Xinyigou District WWTP \nJiamusi City East District WWTP + Effluent Reuse \nNenjiang County WWTP + Sewerage Network \nQiqihar City WWTP (Phase II) \nQitaihe City Effluent Reuse \nShuangyashan City WWTP \nTangyuan County WWTP \nHeilongjiang Component \n\n EIRR = economic internal rate of return, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \n Source: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n \n16. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  Jilin  component  is  calculated  for  each  subproject  and  for  the  whole \ncomponent.  The  EIRR  calculation  takes  into  account  only  the  main  benefits  of  different \ncomponents  but  includes  all  project-related  costs.  For  the  subprojects,  this  approach  yields \nEIRRs ranging from 16.4% to 20.0%. For the whole component, the EIRR is 18.4%. Sensitivity \nanalyses  are  performed  for  each  subproject  (details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L).  For  the \nEIRR of the whole Project, sensitivity analysis shows the EIRR will decrease to (i) 16.4% if the \nProject  experiences  a  cost  overrun  of  10%;  (ii)  15.8%  if  the  benefits  are  reduced  by  10%;  \n(iii) 15.5% if the Project experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 12 1% if (i), (ii), \nand (iii) all happen. Table A12.4 summarizes the EIRRs for all Jilin subprojects. \n \nThe risk analysis was carried out to confirm the viability of the Project. The risk analysis \n17. \nwas carried out using the Monte Carlo simulation technique under a 1,000 simulation basis. The \ninputs for the risk analysis are taken from the base case benefit analysis/cost. The correlation \nbetween  risk  variables  is  explicitly  considered  before  the  simulation  to  avoid  generation  of \nunrealistic project scenarios. The risk analysis for EIRR selected five variables, viz., capital cost, \noutput, input prices, implementation delay, and exchange rate fluctuations. The expected EIRR, \nbased  on  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations,  is  17.8%  (with  a  standard \ndeviation of 2.7%), about 2.9% lower than the base case value without consideration of project \nrisks.  The  probability  for  the  EIRR  to  be  below  the  considered  discount  rate  of  12%  is  1.8%.  \nThe  very  low  economic  risk  is  intuitively  expected  because  the  project  generates  sound \nenvironmental benefits. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12        69 \n\nTable A12.4: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return (Jilin Subprojects) \n\nEIRR (%) \n \n19.1 \n19.8 \n18.3 \n17.9 \n18.0 \n18.2 \n18.7 \n18.8 \n19.5 \n \n16.4 \n19.9 \n18.0 \n19.1 \n19.3 \n17.2 \n19.2 \n19.0 \n19.3 \n18.6 \n \n20.0 \n18.4 \n\nSubprojects \nWWTP \nDehui City WWTP \nFusong County WWTP \nFuyu County WWTP \nGongzhuling City Fanjiatun Town WWTP \nGongzhuling City Sewage Network Upgrade \nJingyu County WWTP \nLiuhe County WWTP \nTonghua County WWTP \nYushu City WWTP \nSWM \nDa\u2019an City SWM \nFusong County SWM \nHuadian City SWM \nHuinan County SWM \nJiaohe City SWM \nJingyu County SMW \nLiuhe County SWM \nMeihekou City SWM \nTongyu County SWM \nYushu City SWM \nRiver Improvement \nChangbaishan Mountain Administrative Committee \nJilin Component \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SWM = solid waste management, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nH. \n \n18. \nThe distribution analysis is based on the proportion of poor households in each county. \nThe  distribution  analysis  for  the  Jilin  component  is  illustrated  in  Table  A12.5.  The  differences \nbetween  the  net  economic  benefits  (NEB)  and  the  net  financial  benefits  (NFB)  give  rise  to \nlosses  and  gains  among  the  project  participants.  Considering  the  overall  result  of  an  NFB  of \nnegative CNY275.1 million and an NEB of CNY4120.6 million for the Project, the NEB exceeds \nthe  NFB  by  CNY3845.5  million.  At  a  discount  rate  of  12%,  the  economy  will  gain  \nCNY1504.9 million, mainly from operating costs. The share of the NEB of the Project accruing \nto the poor is 14.18%. Since the ratio is higher than the poverty ratio (estimated at 7.4% in the \nproject  area),  the  analysis  concludes  that  the  Project  is  pro-poor.  The  14.18%  share  of  NEB \ndoes not include indirect the benefits of the Project.  \n \n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.5: Distribution of Project Benefits and Poverty Impact (Jilin Component) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n2,313.5 \n\n2,313.5  \n\nAccounts \n\nDifference \n\nGovernment \n\n1,409.1  \n2,412.3  \n\n1,406.7  \n1,195.5  \n\n            2.4 \n1,216.8 \n\n         (2.4)  \n(1,216.8)  \n\nFinancial \nAccounts \n4,539.5  \n\nEconomic \nAccounts \n6,853.0  \n\n \nTotal \n \n \n \n \n\n      130.3  \n          0.0  \n2,732.4  \n4,120.6  \n\n       (27.1) \n     (285.7) \n(1,532.0) \n3,845.5  \n\n \nConsumers  Economy \n\nBeneficiaries \n \nLabor \n \n \n \n \n\n \n    157.3  \n \n    285.7  \n \n4,264.4  \n    275.1 \n \nPoverty Impact \n \nBeneficiaries in Financial and Economic Accounts \n \nNet Financial Benefits \n\n \n \nItem \nBenefits \nCosts \nCapital Costs \nOperating \nCosts \nLabor \nTaxes \nTotal Costs \nNet Benefits \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProportion of Poor \n \nBenefits to Poor \n \nPoverty Impact Ratio \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19. \nThe distribution analysis for Heilongjiang component of the Project is provided in Table \nA12.6.
