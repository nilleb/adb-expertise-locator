THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) a proposed grant both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Toktogul Rehabilitation Phase \n3 Project. The report also describes the proposed partial administration of a loan to be provided \nby the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) to the Kyrgyz Republic for the purposes of this \nproject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the partial administration of the EDB loan. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed the rehabilitation of the first two turbine-\ngenerator units and secondary electrical equipment of the largest and most important power \nplant in the Kyrgyz Republic under the Power Sector Rehabilitation Project (Phase 1) and the \nToktogul Rehabilitation Phase 2 Project.1 Implementation of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects \nis ongoing.2 The proposed phase 3 project aims to (i) complete the rehabilitation of the Toktogul \nhydroelectric power plant (HPP) by replacing the two remaining turbine-generator units and \nrefurbishing the civil structures of Toktogul dam, (ii) overhaul the dam monitoring systems at five \ndams along the Naryn cascade, (iii) continue the information campaign to educate the public on \nsector reforms, (iv) conduct corporate financial audits and business operation assessments of \neight state-owned power and heat companies, and (v) implement a management modernization \nprogram for the power generation company.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  power  sector  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  characterized  by  aging  assets,  high \ncommercial losses, and poor performance of the sector companies. Most assets are more than \n30 years old and approaching the end of their economic lives. Given the increased demand for \npower in the Kyrgyz Republic, rehabilitation, replacement, and augmentation of power sector \nassets  are  critical for  energy  security  in  the  country.4 The  economy  has  shown  sustained \ngrowth, averaging 5% in 2011\u20132015. However, growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to slow to \n1%\u20132% because of a slowdown in the economies of key neighboring trade partners.5  \n \n4.  The Kyrgyz Republic is rich in renewable energy sources. More than 3,070 megawatts \n(MW) of the total 3,786 MW of installed power generation capacity come from hydropower, \nalthough the hydropower potential amounts to more than 18,500 MW. About 80% of power \ngeneration is from hydropower and the rest is from two combined heat and power plants in \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Manila \n(L2671/G0218).  \n2  For Phase 1 project, all major contracts were awarded and at advanced stage of implementation, last consultancy \ncontract is expected to be awarded in Q4 2016. One of the project outputs was successfully completed.  For Phase \n2,  project  implementation  consultant  commenced  work  since  April  2016  and  bidding  documents  for  major \ncomponent are expected to be tendered in end-August 2016.  Both projects are currently \u201con track\u201d.   \n3  The project is included in ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Kyrgyz Republic, 2016\u20132018.

Washington, DC.  \n5   ADB. 2016. Asian Development Outlook 2016. Manila. ", "2 \nBishkek and Osh where electricity is generated as a byproduct. Almost 100% of the population \nis connected to the electricity grid; however, with the increase in demand, outages occur in the \nwinter months when hydropower is not available.  \n \n5.  The power sector consists of two generation companies (Open Joint-Stock Companies \nElectric  Power  Plants  [EPP]  and  Chakan  GES);  a  transmission  company;  four  electricity \ndistribution companies; and a district heating company. The Ministry of Economy (MOE) has \ntemporarily taken over strategic planning, policy development, and forecasting from the Ministry \nof Energy and Industry, which was abolished at the end of 2015 to optimize the activities of \nstate agencies.6 Restructuring of state agencies is underway so that a new agency will be \nappointed to assume the former ministry\u2019s function. The State Agency for Regulation of Fuel \nand  Energy  has  tariff-setting  and  licensing  authority,  while  the  National  Energy  Holding \nCompany was established in early 2016 to manage the power sector.  \n \n6.  The country is the largest net exporter of electricity to the 500-kilovolt Central Asian \nPower System (CAPS), with average annual exports of 1,600 gigawatt-hours during 2007\u20132014. \nExports of hydro-based electricity to CAPS occur during summer when electricity production \nexceeds domestic demand, which is associated with water release for regional irrigation needs.7 \nAlong with electricity imports to augment supply, fossil fuels are imported during winter to supply \nthermal power plants.  \n \n7.  Toktogul HPP, located on the Naryn River in Jalal\u2013Abad Province and in service since \n1975, is the largest and most important power plant in the Kyrgyz Republic. It has installed \ncapacity of 1,200 MW and available capacity of 1,192 MW. Producing 40% of the country\u2019s \naverage electricity output (both base and peak load), the Toktogul HPP plays a critical role as a \npower source for domestic use and export, and provides voltage and frequency regulation \nservices to CAPS. Toktogul HPP has had an increasing number of critical failures since 2009 \nbecause of the dilapidated state of its equipment and, as a result, was using only 50% of its \ninstalled capacity in the winter of 2015/2016.  \n \n8.  The  government\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  Reforming  the  Energy  Sector,  supported  by \ndevelopment partners, has yielded some good results: the appointment of a regulator, the \nreduction of losses, and the adoption of a Medium-Term Tariff Plan, 2014\u20132017 (MTTP).8 The \ngovernment achieved a substantial reduction in electricity losses, from nearly 40% of generation \nin 2008 to 22% in 2014. Further reform efforts on corporate governance, operational efficiency, \nand the financial viability of power companies identified by the action plan are required to \nimprove the operational performance of the power sector. The project will assist the sector by (i) \nauditing the financial performance of the eight power and heat companies, (ii) assessing the \nsector\u2019s operational efficiency, and (iii) implementing a business process reengineering program \nfor EPP as a pilot for the sector. These components will increase transparency in power sector \nactivities, streamline business processes, and modernize management and decision-making \nprocesses. \n \n                                                \n6  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2015.

At the start of MTTP implementation, the residential tariff was increased in 2014 by 10 to \n208%  while  the  commercial  consumer  tariff  was  increased  by  92%.9 The  government  will \ngradually increase the weighted average tariff to Som1.67 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) by 2017 to \nachieve cost recovery.10 The main objective of the MTTP is to ensure sustainable financing and \nreliable supply in the face of electricity shortages caused by declining output and the need to \nimport electricity. The government was successful in raising the residential tariff in 2014 and \n2015 without causing social unrest thanks to a public information program funded under the \nphase 1 project, which made the population more aware of the benefits of sector reforms. The \ncampaign  will  be  continued  as  part  of  phase  3  to  inform  the  public  about  recent  sector \ndevelopments and the benefits of an effective tariff policy.  \n \n10.  Development of the energy sector is a critical priority for the Government of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic.11 The project aligns with the government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \n2013\u20132017: (i) focus on reliable power supply, (ii) increase energy security, (iii) expand regional \npower exports, and (iv) improve sector management and operational performance.12 \n \n11.  ADB maintains dialogue with the government on energy sector reform and development, \ncapacity enhancement, and good governance. In 2012, the Power Sector Regional Master Plan \nprepared under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program defined investment \npriorities and a development plan.13 From 2016 to 2018, the government will prepare a 10-year \nmaster plan under the phase 2 project, which will provide long-term demand projections and \nspecify priority projects to secure sustainable and reliable power. The plan will also assess \nrenewable energy capacities and the government\u2019s energy efficiency strategy. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project impact will be aligned with increased reliability of national and regional \npower systems (National Sustainable Development Program, 2013\u20132017). The outcome will be \nimproved operational performance of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s power sector. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The  project\u2019s  physical  outputs  will  be  the  (i)  rehabilitation  of  the  Toktogul  HPP  by \nreplacing two turbine-generator units (including associated auxiliary equipment) and refurbishing \nthe  civil  structures  of  Toktogul  dam,  and  (ii)  overhaul  of  the  dam  monitoring  systems  at \nToktogul,  Kurpsai,  Tashkumyr,  Shamaldy-Sai,  and  Uch  Kurgan  dams.  The  Toktogul  HPP \nrehabilitation is expected to result in (i) a fully refurbished plant that is operational for an \nadditional 35 years, (ii) an increase in generation capacity by 120 MW, and (iii) more reliable \ndomestic and regional power supply.14 The project\u2019s nonphysical outputs will be better public \n                                                \n9  Prior to implementation of MTTP, the residential tariff was Som0.70 per kWh and the industrial tariff was Som1.32 \nper kWh. In 2014, the tariff was increased to Som0.77 per kWh for consumption below 700kWh and to Som2.16 for \nthose above, while commercial tariff was increased to Som2.24 per kWh.  \n10  According to the MTTP, the residential tariff will be increased by 20% in 2016 and 2017. For consumption above \n700 kWh and other consumer groups, the tariff will be increased based on the weighted average tariff plus cost of \nelectricity import with an annual inflation adjustment. In 2014, the cost-to-service weighted average residential tariff \nwas Som1.20 per kWh and Som1.38 per kWh for other consumer groups, while in 2017, the cost-to-service \nweighted average residential tariff will be Som1.47 per kWh and Som1.69 per kWh for other consumer groups.  \n11  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The project will replace turbine-generator units 1 and 3 and all associated equipment \nand repair the dam\u2019s civil structures. This will bring benefits by (i) increasing unit power output \nfrom 300 MW to 360 MW, (ii) increasing unit efficiency from 90.0% to 92.5%, and (iii) improving \navailability from 80.0% to 95.0%. The economic life of the rehabilitated units will be 35 years.   \n \n24.  The need to repair Toktogul dam\u2019s civil structures and overhaul the dam monitoring \nsystems at five dams was identified in the Naryn Cascade Dam Safety Assessment carried out \nunder phase 1. The recommended dam repairs involve (i) corrosion protection, (ii) repair of \ninspection galleries, (iii) overhaul of walkways and ladders, and (iv) implementation of measures \nto protect the civil structures from rock fall and landslides. The overhaul of the dam monitoring \nsystems  will  improve  the  acquisition  of  critical  automated  data  relating  to  safety  and \n ", "    7 \nmanagement of the dam under both normal and extreme loading conditions (occurs during \nearthquakes and flooding). Detailed technical specifications will be finalized by the PMC.  \n \n25.  Suitable  replacement  equipment  is  available  in  the  international  market.  Technical \nspecifications for the design, manufacture, installation, and commissioning of the new turbine-\ngenerator units were prepared under phase 2. Firms qualified to perform the turnkey contract \nare available in the international market. Training of EPP staff on operation and maintenance \nwill be provided by the contractors.   \n \n26.  Initial  screening  rated  the  project  at  high  risk  from  future  climate  change  impacts \nbecause of the expected changes in water availability.  The climate change impact on the \nhydrology of the Syr Darya river basin, which supplies the Toktogul reservoir, was assessed so \nas to ensure climate-proofing measures in the detailed design.16 The hydrology specialist\u2019s \nreport  supports  the  Toktogul  HPP  rehabilitation  and  states  that  (i)  the  reservoir  and  dam \nspillways can safely cater for water inflows that will first increase (owing to melting glaciers) and \nthen decrease, (ii) average energy production will decrease by 11.0% over the next 40 years \n(0.3% per year), and (iii) sediment transport will not decrease the volume of the reservoir.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27.  The economic internal rate of return is calculated at 29%, which compares favorably with \nthe 12% opportunity cost of capital. The project\u2019s economic viability takes into account streams \nof costs and benefits resulting from the rehabilitation of Toktogul HPP and operation over the \nproject\u2019s life. Without the project, the performance of existing units will continue to deteriorate, \nand they will eventually cease to operate. The project will rehabilitate the power station and \nincrease its generation capacity. The benefits of the project come from avoided power outages \nand major incidents. Regional economic benefits are not included in the economic internal rate \nof return calculations since they accrue to countries other than the Kyrgyz Republic. Sensitivity \nanalysis on key issues such as capital cost increase, completion delay, and slower deterioration \nof the existing units also indicate economic viability of the project. \n \n28.  The financial internal rate of return is calculated at 12.54%, which compares favorably \nwith the weighted average cost of capital of 2.00%. Financial viability was gauged by comparing \nthe  revenue  and  cost  streams  of  scenarios  with  and  without  the  project.  The  result  of  a \nsensitivity analysis confirms that the project\u2019s economic and financial viability is robust even \nunder unfavorable circumstances. The financial internal rate of return is based on proposed \ntariff  increases  under  the  MTTP.  In the  event  of  a tariff  increase  not  being  implemented, \ngovernment assurances to provide for debt servicing and operation and maintenance coverage \nat EPP have been sought through a legal covenant to assure financial sustainability of the \nproject. The government agrees to provide at least 60% of incremental heat and electricity \nrevenues resulting from the implementation of the MTTP to EPP as additional revenues to \nimprove EPP\u2019s financial situation.  \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  A financial management assessment, including a risk management assessment, was \nconducted following ADB guidelines. Similar to the country\u2019s weak public financial management, \nEPP\u2019s  financial  management  capabilities  are  also  weak  but  improving  compared  with  the \nprevious assessment. EPP has been implementing the phase 1 and phase 2 projects since \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Enabling Climate Change Interventions in Central and West Asia. Manila. (TA \n7274-REG). \n ", "8 \n2012 and has submitted an external audit report on its project financial statement on time and \nwith no material qualifications. Consequently, the financial management arrangements now in \nplace for phase 1 are considered acceptable for the phase 3 project. Building up financial \nmanagement  capabilities  and  effective  internal  control  and  auditing,  and  strengthening \nprocurement capacity and procedures are critical to improve corporate performance. These will \nbe addressed under the business operations assessment and EPP management modernization \ncomponent.   \n \n30.  A procurement risk assessment concluded that the project risk is medium. To mitigate \nthe risk, a procurement risk management plan was proposed.17 \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and EPP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  Poverty.  The  general  population  will  benefit  from  a  transparent,  accountable,  and \nefficient power sector. During power cuts, the poor are disproportionally affected because they \nmust  rely  on  more  expensive  (nonelectric)  energy  sources.  The  project  will  not  impact \naffordability or operational employment opportunities, but without the project, energy security \nwill be compromised and will affect industries and therefore jobs. Benefits for women will be in \nthe form of less time required to do housework because they will be able to use reliable \nelectrical appliances under reliable electricity supply.  \n \n33.  During construction, civil works contractors will be required to ensure equal opportunities \nfor all social groups, equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, and prohibition of child \nlabor. The contractors will also be required to undertake HIV/AIDS awareness activities with \nconstruction workers. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  Environmental assessment. The project (including the EDB-financed part) is classified \ncategory  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental \nexamination with an environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared in accordance with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement, as guided by the framework financing agreement between \nADB and EDB. Public consultation was carried out, and the records were included in the initial \nenvironmental  examination. The report  was  endorsed  by  EPP  and  approved  by  the  State \nAgency for Environmental Protection and Forestry in early February 2016, and posted on the \nADB and EPP websites in February 2016. The initial environmental examination will be updated \nby the PIU as necessary, based on the detailed design by the turnkey contractor.   \n \n35.  The main environmental impacts of the project are (i) occupational health and safety at \nthe project site; (ii) handling of used oil and grease waste; (iii) disposal of scrap metal and other \nsolid waste; (iv) civil works for dam refurbishment; (v) transportation of construction materials \nand heavy equipment to the project site; and (vi) removal of generated waste from the project \nsite. The EMP specifies adequate mitigation measures and monitoring plans to cover these \nimpacts. Released oils and scrap metals will be kept safe at the on-site storage area, which will \nbe improved with financing under the phase 1 project for usage throughout the whole Toktogul \n                                                \n17 Project Procurement Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "    9 \nrehabilitation program. EPP is responsible for ensuring that licensed companies, under the \nmonitoring and supervision of the PMC and PIU, recycle and dispose oils and scrapmetals. \n \n36.  The PIU will be responsible for EMP implementation with assistance from the PMC and \nstaff of EPP\u2019s Service of Reliability and Safety Department. An environmental and hazardous \nwaste management specialist will be hired under the project as part of the PIU, for in-house \ncapacity building of EPP during the implementation of the whole Toktogul rehabilitation program. \nEnvironmental monitoring will be performed by the PMC. Monitoring results will be included in \nthe project quarterly progress reports and semiannual environmental reports. \n \n37.  The costs of EMP mitigation measures will be included in the turnkey contract, and the \ncost for environmental monitoring will be included in the consulting services of the PMC.  \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified category \nC for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. A due diligence report was prepared to support the C categorization. All civil works \nwill be carried out within the confines of the existing Toktogul HPP, so no land acquisition or \nlivelihood impacts will occur. A transport management plan will be developed by the turnkey \ncontractor for the delivery of turbines and other oversized materials and equipment. EPP will \ncoordinate the plan with the National Traffic Police and local governments. The project is not \nexpected to affect indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements on \nindigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.   Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The overall assessment is that risks were \nidentified and mitigated, and that the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak financial management,  The government will implement an action plan to improve the financial \ninternal control, and risk  management systems and business operations of eight power and heat \nmanagement  companies under MOE.
