The Project, consistent with the sector approach\nand  the 1995 Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP), comprises\n(i) policy and institutional  reforms to make local communities\nand  the  private  sector  full  partners  in  forest  resource\ndevelopment  and  management,  (ii)  technical  and  operational\ncapacity  building  of  the  Executing  Agency  (the  Ministry  of\nForestry  and  Environment  [MFE])  and  the  participating\ncommunities to improve their effectiveness, and (iii) investments\nfor increasing forest resource production from public and private\nlands.\nMFE will implement the Project in about 10 subproject areas\n(SPAs).  Subprojects  will  use  integrated  forest  resource\ndevelopment  and  management  that  is  responsive  to  the\ndevelopment  needs  of  the  local  communities  and  the  forest\nsector at large. Based on detailed needs assessments in the\nthree core SPAs   (Anuradhapura, Badulla and Nuwara Eliya,\nand  Ratnapura)  forest  resource  development  and  livelihood\nimprovement  packages  were  developed  and  project\nimplementation  strategies  identified  in  consultation  with  the\nstakeholders. The remaining seven SPAs have been selected in\naccordance  with  agreed  upon  criteria  between  MFE,  Forest\nDepartment,  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Project\nactivities  in  these  areas  will  be  based  on  detailed  feasibility\nstudies    that    will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  a\npredetermined schedule. Project implementation in the noncore\nSPAs  will  be  enhanced  by  the  experience  gained  during\nimplementation in core SPAs.\nClassification: Primary     -   Environment\nSecondary -  Poverty Reduction\nEnvironment Category  -   B\nAssessment: An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken and\nsummary IEE is included in an appendix.\nRationale: Increasing  forest  loss  and  degradation,  and  accompanied\nimpoverishment of the  communities whose livelihoods depend\non forests are dual challenges faced by Sri Lanka. Poverty and\nfood insecurity is increasing especially among people living near\ntraditional forest areas or plantations. Consequently, they are\nincreasingly  encroaching  on  the  forest,  resulting  in  forest\nconversion and degradation.  In the long run, impoverishment\nand    land  degradation  lead  to  food  deficits  that  necessitate\nfurther   extension   of   agriculture  to  the  adjacent   forestlands,", "iii\nintensifying land-use conflicts and tension between the Forest\nDepartment and the local communities. Addressing the genuine\nfood security and livelihood needs of these communities, and\ntheir involvement in developing alternative forest use strategies\nand  practices,  are  a  prerequisite  to  the  institutionalization  of\nsustainable  forest  management.    By  employing  the  sector\napproach, the  Project  will  (i)  rationalize and  bring  coherence\namong macro- and micro-level policies and among institutional\nand management structures and practices, (ii) enhance private\nand public sector capacities for collaborative development and\nmanagement of state forests, and (iii) increase wood and timber\nproduction from public and private lands.\nThe    1995-2020  FSMP  lays  out  the  long-term  sector\ndevelopment  priorities  and  investment  strategies.  This  is\ncomplemented  by  the  new  National  Forestry  Policy  that\nemphasizes participatory forest management principles and is in\nline with the forest sector policy of ADB.\nMFE (i) has developed a seven-year implementation plan that\ncorresponds  to  the first part of  the  FSMP,  (ii)  has  proposed\npromulgation  of  a  forestry  ordinance  to  implement  the  new\nNational  Forest  Policy,  (iii)  has  successfully  implemented\nparticipatory  and  community  forestry  projects,  and  (iv)  is\nimplementing watershed conservation projects. Thus, MFE has\ndemonstrated the  technical and managerial capability required\nto  undertake  a  sector  project  to  meet  the  development  and\nmanagement challenges faced by Sri Lanka.\nObjectives The overall  goal of the  Project  is  to  increase  the  value  and\nand Scope: sustainability  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  forests  by  creating  a  policy  and\ngovernance  framework  to  enable  local  communities  and  the\nprivate sector to participate in forest resource development and\nmanagement. The objectives of the Project are to (i) establish\nparticipatory  sustainable  forest  management  of  a  permanent\nforest area, to increase its protection and production; and (ii)\nenhance  access  of  the  local  communities,  in  particular  the\neconomically disadvantaged people, to gainful employment and\nother  income  generation  activities.  In  addition  to  income\ngeneration,  the project activities will  help improve the overall\nskill base of the poorest of the poor to enable them to influence\ndecisions and access programs that have an impact on their\nlivelihoods.\nThe Project has three components. (i) Participatory  planning,\nmanagement, and awareness campaigns will involve potential\nbeneficiaries, official policy and decision makers including the\njudiciary, and civil society at large. The campaigns will ensure\nthat  there  is  a  consensus  about  the  national  forest\u2019s\nadministrative boundaries and the management objectives and\npriorities for its use. (ii) Sustainable forest resource development\nand management activities will involve local communities, the\nprivate sector at large, and the Forest Department  in increasing\nforest conservation,  enhancing production  of  wood  and timber,", "iv\nand  improving  environmental  services  for  public  and  private\nlands.  This  will  include  establishing  agroforestry  and  woodlot\nplots  on  forests  that  are  degraded  and/or  encroached\nforestlands, to help increase food security and reduce poverty\namong the poor forest dependent communities. (iii) Institutional\nstrengthening  for  improved  sector  performance  will  include\nimproving the technical knowledge base of Forest Department\nprofessional  and  extension  staff,  participating  beneficiaries,\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  community-based\norganizations  (CBOs)  for  establishing  the  best  forest\nconservation and resource management practices.\nCost Estimates: The total project costs are estimated at $40.0 million equivalent\nconsisting of $5.7 million in foreign exchange costs and $34.3\nmillion in local currency costs.\nFinancing Plan: $ million\nSource      Foreign          Local         Total     Percent\n    Currency      Currency      Cost\nADB        5.7 21.3 27.0    68\nGovernment        0.0 10.0 10.0    25\nBeneficiarie        0.0 3.0 3.0      7\ns\nTotal        5.7 34.3 40.0 100\nLoan Amount The equivalent in various currencies of SDR20.6 million ($27.0\nand Terms: million)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  (i)  with  a\nrepayment  period of 32 years including a grace period of 8\nyears, (ii) an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the\ngrace  period  and 1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  (iii)\npayable semiannually.\nPeriod of Utilization: Until 30 June 2008.\nMinistry of Forestry and Environment\nExecuting Agency:\nMFE will be responsible for overall planning,  monitoring, and\nImplementation supervision of project implementation.

The  project  implementation  responsibilities  and\nbenefit sharing among NGOs, CBOs, Forest Department, other\nland-owning  agencies,  and  participating  communities  will  be\nagreed  upon  with  them  prior  to  implementation.  Surveys\ninvolving  delineation,  demarcation,  and  mapping  of  forest\nboundaries will be undertaken by  the Forest Department in a\nfully  participatory  manner  and  in  accordance  with  an  agreed\nupon time-bound plan acceptable to ADB. This activity will be\ncarried out with close collaboration with the Survey  Department,", "v\nwhich has agreed to work closely with the Forest Department in\nimplementing this component of the Project.\nProcurement: All supplies, equipment, and services to be financed by ADB will\nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on\nProcurement. Most of the items, such as basic equipment and\nmaterials (herbicides, fungicides, seeds, fertilizers, and seedling\nbags), to be used over a wide area will be procured centrally in\nbulk for cost efficiency. They will be procured in accordance with\nthe Government\u2019s domestic procurement procedures acceptable\nto ADB. Supply contracts for  equipment  or  materials  are  not\nanticipated to exceed the equivalent of $500,000, so purchasing\nwill be carried out through international shopping.

A  total  of  about  50,000\nbeneficiary  households  will  benefit  from  the  Project.  The\nbeneficiaries are the poor and disadvantaged sections of rural\ncommunities  consisting  of  landless  people,  sharecroppers,\nhouseholds  headed by  women,  and  ethnic  minorities.  Of  the\nhouseholds in the core subproject areas, 40-65 percent is below\nthe poverty line and will benefit directly from improved access for\nproductive activities in forestlands, where they will have greater\nsecurity  of  tenure,  and  from  employment  generated  by  the\nProject. Direct benefits will be derived from the sale or home\nconsumption    of  timber    products.  Other  important  benefits\ninclude reduction of soil erosion,  conservation of biodiversity,\nand  further  development  of  participatory  forest  management\nstrategies. The estimated economic internal  rates of return for\nthe core subprojects range from 13 to 20 percent. The estimated\nfinancial internal rates of return of several reforestation activities\nrange from 13 to 16 percent.", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Forest Resources Management\nSector Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Government of Sri Lanka sought assistance from the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) in 1997 to finance a project aimed at promoting sustainable forest resource management.\nThe preparation of the Project was carried out under ADB technical assistance (TA).1 Following\ncompletion of the TA, fact-finding was carried out in 1999 and ADB appraised the Project from\n8-23 March 2000.2 This report has been based on the feasibility  study  and  the  mission\u2019s\ndiscussions with the representatives of Government agencies, nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs), communities, beneficiaries, and bilateral and multilateral aid agencies in Sri Lanka.\nThe project design is summarized in the project framework in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. Forest Sector in Sri Lanka\n1. Sector Description\n3. Sri Lanka\u2019s national forests cover about 28 percent of the country\u2019s 6.6 million hectares\n(ha) land area, with 1.65 million ha under natural forests.3 These forests exhibit high levels of\ndiversity and some of the rarest plant species in the world are found in them. Dry-mixed\nevergreen forests are the most widespread forest type in the country, and are home to some of\nthe poorest segments of the country\u2019s population. Moreover, Sri Lanka\u2019s forests play a crucial\nrole in maintaining soil, water, and nutrient cycles that support and sustain agriculture and allied\nactivities.\n4. Over the last century, forests have been converted for agriculture, plantation corps,\nshifting cultivation, and human settlements. Although commercial logging in the natural forests\nwas banned in early 1980s, population and development pressures have resulted in an annual\ndeforestation rate of 1.1 percent during 1990-1995; this rate is the second highest in South\nAsia.4 Conflicting and unsound policies and undefined national forest boundaries have abetted\nthe land conversion, deforestation, and forest area fragmentation activities. The present forests\nare  in  blocks  ranging  from  less  than  20  to  several  hundred  hectares,  with  a  few  blocks\nmeasuring 10,000 ha or more. Several of the forests that are in urgent need of conservation are\nnot surveyed and thus are not legally gazetted (publicly recorded) and demarcated, thereby\nlimiting the effectiveness of efforts to conserve them. The fragmented and dispersed nature of\nthe forest area has overstretched the administrative and management capacity of the Forest\nDepartment (FD).\n                                               \n1  TA 3047-SRI: Forest Resource Management Project, for $800,000, approved on 20 July 1998.\n2 The Mission comprised Toshio Kondo, Sr. Project Economist/Mission Leader; J. H. Mir, Forestry Specialist; R.\nO\u2019Sullivan, Counsel; I. Simbolon, Social Development Specialist; S.T. Qadri, Sr. Environment Specialist; and L.\nSaunders, Staff Consultant/Natural Resource Economist. J. Cooney, Resident Representative; S. Ranawana of\nSri Lanka Resident Mission, and H. Imamura, Programs Officer, assisted the Mission.\n3    Forests that have remained unmodified in terms of species composition and structure, and depend on natural\nregeneration for their renewal.\n4 For the same period, Nepal ranked first in deforestation rates in South Asia.", "2\n5. The administration and management responsibilities for the national forest estate are\nprimarily shared by FD (1.06 million ha) and the Department of Wildlife Conservation (0.78 million\nha). Because many forestlands have been converted to other land uses, the traditional forest area\nboundaries have become obsolete. Hence, FD\u2019s administrative and managerial jurisdiction is not\nwell defined and this undermines its capacity to effectively protect and manage forests. FD\u2019s\npreoccupation with enforcement of timber transport regulations and centralized decision making\nhas resulted in inadequate attention to improving the productivity of the forests. Consequently, the\nforests produce less than 1 cubic meter (m3) of wood per hectare per year. This is far less than\ntheir full potential of 3-4 m3 per year. Low forest production has resulted in increasing shortages of\nraw  materials  for  the  domestic  saw  milling  and  plywood  industries,  and  extraction  from\nnonsustainable sources.\n6. The Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP), developed in 1995, identified that wood for the\ndomestic saw milling, plywood, and manufacturing industries would be significantly lacking\nwithin 10-15 years. Current industrial wood demand is estimated at 2.1million m3 of which 26\npercent is imported. The plantation estate sector contributes 30 percent, home gardens 32\npercent, and illegal logging from natural forests is estimated to account for 20-28 percent of the\ndomestic industrial wood supply. Industrial plantations contribute less than 10 percent to local\nwood production, but supply the construction and furniture  manufacturing  sectors.  Present\ntrends in decreasing forest cover and wood supply clearly indicate present domestic sources\ncan not meet the demand.\n7. Raw material supply problems of the wood industry are exacerbated by the monopolistic\nrole of the State Timber Corporation (STC), and perverse policies and regulations governing\ntransport of privately grown timber. This has resulted in poorly formed market channels and\nlinkages. STC\u2019s de facto monopoly over harvesting, transporting, and marketing of logs from FD\nplantations discourages private sector involvement in forestry. STC\u2019s monopoly and inefficiencies\nalso cause high production costs and losses of wood harvested. Consequent wood shortages\ncontribute to overexploitation of the state forests.\n8. In 1998, the forest sector contributed about 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP),\nand  primary  and  secondary  wood  industries  employed  about  60,000  people.  However,  the\ncontribution of the forest sector to national and local economies is not fully captured by the current\neconomic and financial accounting systems. For example, nonwood forest products have a role in\nthe rural economy. About 14 million rural people, or about 80 percent of the national population,\ndepend on forests to supply a wide range of such products. In the Knuckles region alone, on an\naverage, about 16 percent of the total family income is derived from such products. In some\nplaces, cultivation of cardamom in the forests provides about 26 percent of the total family\nincome. The undervaluation of financial returns from the sector causes policy and decision-\nmakers to underestimate its revenue mobilization capacity. Sri Lanka\u2019s forest sector has not\nreceived the investment support commensurate with its development challenges.\n9. In response to increased forestland conversion and increasing wood product demand,\nSri Lanka initiated in 1870s a plantation program that was intensified in the 1950s. To date,\n135,000  hectares  of  plantations5  have  been  established  to  serve  environmental  and\ndevelopmental objectives. Because of declining areas of natural forests, the importance of\ncommercial plantations has increased. However, the plantations often suffer from insufficient\nsilvicultural management, resulting in suboptimal growth. Thus, the plantations realize less than\n30 percent of their potential because of delays in harvesting caused by STC\u2019s monopoly.\nConsequently, STC is often unable to meet harvesting targets, and substantial wood production\nand revenue are lost.\n                                               \n5  The most common plantation species are teak, eucalyptus, pine, and mahogany.", "3\n2. Rural Poverty in Sri Lanka\n 10. Although Sri Lanka has strong social indicators compared with other countries in South\nAsia, its incidence of poverty is high, with 21 percent of the total 18.8 million population still\nliving  in  poverty.  Despite  the  high  priority  that  the  Government  has  assigned  to  poverty\nreduction in recent years, the number of poor people has not declined significantly. According to\nthe preliminary findings of the Government\u2019s, ongoing poverty study,6 poverty is predominantly a\nrural phenomenon in Sri Lanka, with over 85 percent of the poor in rural areas. Most of the poor\nare concentrated in the provinces where agricultural growth has been slow due to adverse\nagroecological conditions and insufficient infrastructure such as roads and markets. Malnutrition\nis widespread especially among children and mothers. Sri Lanka\u2019s food balance sheets for 1993\nand 1994 show low per capita availability of calories, which is just above the recommended\nminimum of 2,100 calories per day.\n \n 11. Despite the introduction of the welfare-driven Samurdhi social safety net programs,7 Sri\nLanka does not have a specific poverty policy. The Government began its Poverty Reduction\nStudy in 1998, with a view to developing a comprehensive poverty framework for the country.\nThe Government is coordinating Sri Lanka\u2019s first integrated survey of poverty, which will provide\nvaluable additional information about the household, social, and economic characteristics of\npoverty. The Government\u2019s framework for poverty reduction under the study advocates a three-\npronged strategy to achieve poverty reduction: (i) improving economic and social opportunities\nfor the poor, and broadening the range of people who benefit from growth; (ii) providing security\nto people unable to participate in mainstream economic activities and protecting excluded,\nmarginalized, and vulnerable groups; and (iii) empowering people to have a voice in decision\nmaking and development.\n12. The  contributing  causes  of  poverty  in  the  rural  area  are  (i)  lack  of  remunerative\neconomic activities, associated with high levels of unemployment; and (ii) landlessness and lack\nof secure land and tree tenure. The dry zone areas have the highest incidence of poverty in the\ncountry. Near forest reserves in the dry zone, 38 percent of the population is below the poverty\nline and 57 percent is just above it.8 Most of the households near forest reserves, regardless of\nincome, are on encroached lands. Where land is still available, most households engage in\nshifting cultivation on state land that can supply 20 percent of the household income and\nprovide subsistence grain and vegetables. Communities near forest reserves in the dry zone\nareas also depend on forest resources for self-employment activities. The condition in the wet\nzone  areas  is  slightly  better.  Socioeconomic  surveys  show  that  households  near  forest\nperipheries  receive  45-65  percent  of  their  income  from  tea.  Although  50  percent  of  the\nhouseholds earn SLRs3,000-8,000 ($41-$109) per month in the wet zone areas, in some areas\n13  percent  of  households  fall  below  the  poverty  line.  While  income  levels  are  definitely\ncorrelated to landholding size, all income groups are found to have encroached on forestland,\nand encroached upon lands account for 26 percent of total landholdings. Home gardens, which\nare usually managed by women on encroached lands, are an important source of multiple\nproducts, from fruit to minor export crops to wood.\n                                               \n6 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank support the ongoing poverty study.\n7 Since its introduction in 1994, the Samurdhi Program has become the Government\u2019s principal poverty alleviation\nand social safety net program. In 1998 the program budget amounted to 4 percent of government expenditure.\nThe welfare transfer component, accounting for 85 percent of program budget, provides needy households with\nin- kind transfers using a system of food stamps. There are six categories of eligible households, with the highest\nlevels of transfers being SLRs1,000 per month for those categorized as ultra poor, and SLRs500 per month for\nthose categorized as poor.\n8 The poverty line is SLRs3,540 ($48) per household per month.", "4\n13. In rural areas the poor are partly the cause, but are also the victims, of the forest\ndegradation  problem.  The  extent  and  patterns  of  dependence  on  the  forest  vary  among\ncommunities,  depending  on  the  nature,  magnitude,  and  accessibility  of  forest  resources.\nHowever, the primary dependence of certain forest communities, especially in the dry zone, on\na rapidly depleting resource is one of the major causes of deprivation. Poverty among the\ncommunities  near  forest  reserves  has  increased  pressure  on  forest  resources  through\nincreased land encroachments, degradation, and deforestation. On the other hand, insecurity of\nland rights for long-term use or lease arrangements over the encroached land has discouraged\nmany forest communities from making a long-term investment in the land. The inability of the\nresource base to regenerate itself because of the heavy pressure of exploitation and uncertainty\nof  land  rights  sets  up  a  resource  depletion-poverty  cycle,  which  reinforces  the  poverty-\nenvironment degradation nexus.\n14. Reducing poverty by meeting the legitimate needs of poor people dependent on forests\nby providing income-earning opportunities, household energy, and fodder for cattle can break\nthis vicious cycle. In this context, security of tenure over forestland is a prerequisite for local\ncommunities to participate in activities to ensure they share in the output.\n15. NGOs9  in  Sri  Lanka  also  play  an  important  role  in  poverty  reduction.  They  help\nimplement afforestation and community development programs. Given their experience in rural\nself-employment programs and the development of microenterprises, their services can be used\nin poverty reduction programs to enhance community participation through social mobilization\nand  training  of  poor  rural  communities.  Moreover,  NGOs  can  facilitate  the  formation  of\ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs) dedicated to poverty reduction and forest resource\nmanagement, and provide critical support to nascent CBOs of the rural poor, until they become\nself-reliant.\nB. Government Policies, Plans, and Programs\n1. Strategic Framework, Policies, and Legislation\n16. The Government has recognized that to solve the problem of the diminishing forest\nresource base and the fragmented nature of the forest estate, the cooperation and participation\nof  all  stakeholders  is  required  for  instituting  sustainable  forest  management.  Stakeholder\nparticipation, especially of the local communities is essential for (i) establishing, delineating, and\nenforcing forest area boundaries and thereby forest protection; (ii) increasing wood production\noutside the state forests through social forestry programs, thereby increasing the production\nbase and easing the pressure on natural forests; and (iii) ensuring conservation of protected\nareas. This shift from the traditional protectionist approach to a participatory one is essential to\nensure  that  the  management  systems  respond  to  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  the  local\ncommunities, and reduce poverty by generating employment and income. To establish genuine\nparticipatory forest management, stakeholder participation has to be secured for the Project\u2019s\nfull planning and implementation cycle. This has to be complemented with secure tenurial\narrangements for sharing the benefits from the assets created. However, the implementation of\nthis strategy requires (i) transparency with regards to technical, financial, and administrative\naspects  of  development  interventions;  (ii)  full  accountability  of  all  actions  involved  in\nimplementing development activities; and (iii) institution of an independent monitoring system.\n                                               \n 9 SST: REG 99027: Special Evaluation Study of the Role of Nongovernment Organizations and Community-Based\nOrganizations in Asian Development Bank. The study reveals that NGO/CBO involvement enhances consultative\nand participatory project development, which is positively linked to project quality. Evidence exists that the use of\nNGOs/CBOs  improves  the  effectiveness  of  projects  where  beneficiary  consultation  and  participation  are\nimportant.", "5\n17. The adoption of the new National Forest Policy (NFP)10 in 1995 reflects government\ncommitment to policy and institutional reforms to institute participatory forest management. The\nforest policy acknowledges concern for safeguarding the remaining natural forests for posterity.\nIt emphasizes the importance of retaining the present natural forest cover and increasing the\noverall tree cover, and the need for an effective forest protected area system to conserve\nbiodiversity,  soil, and  water  resources.  The  production forests,  including  plantations  under\nsustainable forest management, are to provide for the growing demand for forest products.\nFurthermore,  the  NFP  recognizes  the  crucial  role  to  be  played  by  home  gardens  and\nnonforestlands  through the use of social forestry and  agroforestry  technologies.  The  NFP\nenvisages broadening the institutional framework for forest management with clearly defined\nroles  and  responsibilities for the forest  resource development partners.  The public  sector,\nfarmers, local communities, NGOs, and small- and medium-scale commercial entrepreneurs all\nhave a role in activities such as protecting the forests; growing trees to meet the wood and\nbioenergy requirements; supplying raw material for wood-based industries; and harvesting,\ntransporting, processing, and marketing various forest products.\n18. The  FSMP  conforms  to  the  spirit  of  the  NFP  by  providing  a  sector  development\nframework  for  1995-2020.  The  FSMP  takes  into  account  lessons  learned  from  various\ndevelopment programs, and emphasizes a participatory approach to address issues faced by\nthe forest sector. The lessons include  (i) ensuring that rural communities are empowered to\nmanage multiple-use forests for their own benefit; and (ii) in case of natural forests, striking a\nbetter  balance  between  the  production  and  protection  functions  by  ensuring  participatory\nsustainable  forest  management  is  practiced  by  all  willing  and  capable  stakeholders.  The\nreorientation  accomplished  through  the  NFP  led  FD  to  develop  the  1997  Five-Year\nImplementation Program (FYIP). The FYIP prescribes a balance between conservation and\nsustainable forest management supported by public and private sector smallholder participation\nin commercial forestry, and provided a sectoral implementation framework of the FSMP.\n19. During the last three years, planned investment for implementation of the FYIP has been\ndelayed  by  limited  public  sector  financial  resources  and  delays  in  the  establishment  of\nappropriate legislation and institutional reform to support the policy environment. The FYIP has\nbeen  updated  and  renamed  the  Seven-Year  Implementation  Plan  (SYIP).  It  includes  a\ndevelopment plan to facilitate investments in the sector by ADB and other interested funding\nsources. The SYIP stresses the need to demarcate zone forestlands  as a prerequisite  to\nprograms dealing with forest resources management, biodiversity conservation, conservation of\nsoil and water resources, forest plantations, social and agroforestry development, and wood-\nbased industries. The FSMP and SYIP also highlight the need for private sector participation. In\nresponse to ADB\u2019s concerns, policies have been developed that will facilitate commercialization\nof selected State operations, introduce a proper permit system for utilizing the forest resources,\nreduce  and  refine  State  control,  and  confirm  proper  tenure  arrangements.  Implementing\nlegislation and institutional reforms (including restructuring and capacity building of FD) have\nbeen developed and are currently in the process of being formalized. The SYIP also includes (i)\naccelerating the development and implementation of forest management plans, (ii) creating\nsecure conditions for long-term investments by private firms in commercial forestry; and (iii)\nderegulating the timber trade. The SYIP, which commences in the year 2000, provides an\nappropriate framework for investment.\n20. While the Forest Ordinance of 1907 provides the legal framework for the forest sector, it\nis not fully responsive to participatory objectives of the NFP. Thirteen amendments since 1907\n                                               \n10  The basic principle of ADB\u2019s involvement in forestry is to ensure the balance of protection and production\nthrough the participation of stakeholders, according to Asian Development Bank. 1995.  ADB Policy on Forestry,\nManila.", "6\nhave  updated  the  framework  but  most  of  these  emphasize  protectionist  and  regulatory\napproaches  to  forest  sector  development.  In  recognition  of  the  imperative  to  make  the\nlegislation fully responsive and aligned with the letter and spirit of the NFP, the Government is\nconsidering promulgating new legislation or amending the ordinance. The proposed legislation\nis being prepared by the Ministry of Forestry and Environment (MFE) for submission to the\nCabinet prior to its consideration by Parliament.\n2. Institutional Framework and Forestry Sector Development\n21. MFE is primarily responsible for the development of forestry policies, coordination of\nsector development programs, preparation of overall policy guidance on the forestry sector, and\nsupervision of key sector institutions, including FD and STC. Other government agencies also\naffect the forestry sector activities. The Department of Wildlife Conservation11 administers over\n12  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  land  as  protected  areas.  FD  and  Department  of  Wildlife\nConservation share common concerns with biodiversity and soil conservation.\n22. STC12 is responsible for the extraction of timber from state forests and plantations, and\nsale of logs and of sawn wood and furniture produced in its plants. Its jurisdiction was extended\nin 1982 to the import of timber, afforestation works and forest management, and agricultural\nproduction.\n23. As  enunciated  in  the  NFP,  the  Government  stresses  that  institutional  reforms  are\nimportant  to  allow  the  implementation  of  integrated  forest  resources  management  plans\n(IFRMPs)  and  institutionalize  in  MFE  sound  forest  resources  management  practices  and\nprocedures.  The  Government  also  recognizes  that  active  participation  of  all  stakeholders\nincluding NGOs and CBOs is required to successfully implement the IFRMPs. Activities of many\nNGOs  and  CBOs  are  associated  with  forests.  However,  most  such  organizations  stress\nenvironmental conservation rather than sustained yield forest management. While NGOs are\nlarge organizations with national level presence and local-level branches, CBOs are localized\npeoples' organizations that espouse particular causes. Some of them undertake reforestation\nwhile others are associated with soil and water conservation and rural development. Given the\nmandate for their involvement in forestry under the NFP, NGOs and CBOs are likely to play an\nimportant role in managing and protecting forest resources.\n24. NGOs in Sri Lanka have played an important role in poverty reduction. They have\nhelped implement afforestation and community development programs. Given their experience\nin rural areas in support of self-employment programs and the development of microenterprises,\ntheir services can be utilized in poverty reduction programs to enhance community participation\nthrough  social  mobilization  and  training  of  poor  rural  communities.  Moreover,  NGOs  can\nfacilitate the formation of CBOs dedicated to poverty reduction and environmental management,\nand provide critical support to nascent CBOs of the rural poor until they become self-reliant.\n25. FD must realign itself and gear itself to play the changing role associated especially with\nthe (i) emphasis on peoples\u2019 participation in the protection, conservation, development, and\nmanagement of natural forests and plantations; (ii) strengthening of NGOs and CBOs to act as\npartners  in  facilitating  the  implementation  of  the  NFP;  and  (iii)  development  of  a  closer\nrelationship between the forest dependent communities and FD staff, as the two are equal and\nimportant parts of the forest resources development process. In recognition of this change in\nperspective  from  the  traditional  policing  function,  FD  has  committed  to  realign  itself  and\n                                               \n11  Under the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs.\n12  A Government corporation established through provisions of the 1957 Industrial Corporation Act, under the MFE\npurview in 1968.", "7\ndecentralize its administration, devolve authority to field-based units, and bring its staff closer to\nthe forests and away from the policing functions.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n26. Since 1975, the forest sector of Sri Lanka has received an estimated $100 million of\nbilateral and multilateral assistance. Major sources of assistance have included ADB, the World\nBank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and bilateral aid agencies such as\nthe United States Agency for International Development (USAID); the Overseas Development\nAdministration (ODA), now the Department for International Development (DFID) of United\nKingdom (UK); the Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA); and the Australian\nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID).  The  focus  of  external  assistance  was\nconventional  reforestation  in  1980s,  which  gradually  shifted  in  the  1990s  to  sustainable\nmanagement  of  forest  resources  through  participatory  approaches,  while  strengthening\ninstitutional capacities of FD.\n27. ADB's assistance began in 1982 with the Community Forestry Project.13 The project,\nwhich was successfully completed in 1991, aimed at addressing the problem of declining forest\nresources by conventional reforestation in a block plantation program and a small social forestry\ncomponent involving tree cultivation by rural communities. 8,100 ha of block plantations and\n1,200 ha of farmers' woodlots were established. This was followed by the ongoing Participatory\nForestry Project.14 This project increased production of forest and tree products, enhanced\nemployment opportunities and income, and rehabilitated environmentally degraded areas in the\ncountry through beneficiaries\u2019 participation. AusAID cofinanced the project in the form of food\naid paid to farmers as compensation for time spent in tree planting and maintenance activities.\nADB\u2019s Upper Watershed Management Project15 addresses the forest and land degradation and\npoverty  in  the upper  watersheds by  increasing forest  cover  in  critical  watersheds  through\nintegrated and participatory approaches, with the added objective of increasing productivity and\nsmall-scale farmers\u2019 income by promoting conservation-oriented farming systems.\n28. External assistance  (Appendix  2)  has  also  played  an  important  role  in  the  sector,\nparticularly in the development of the Forestry Master Plan in 1983, funded by the World Bank\nand FINNIDA. In 1991, the World Bank, FINNIDA, DFID, and UNDP provided assistance to the\nForestry  Sector  Development  Project  to  help  the  Government  improve  forestry  sector\nperformance in line with Sri Lanka's economic, social, and environmental requirements by\ndeveloping and implementing a five-year portion of the FSMP.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n29. The forest sector findings of the Country Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Sri\nLanka (1997),16 lessons learned from the forestry projects funded by ADB,  and other aid\nagencies in Sri Lanka point to a number of issues that need to be addressed in the forest sector\nincluding reforms in policy, legislation, and institutional matters. The issues include (i) sustained\nand full participation of the local communities and their access to secure land and tree tenure,\n(ii)  deregulation  of  harvesting  and  transportation  of  timber  grown  on  private  lands;\n(ii) reorientation  and  redeployment  of  the  FD  staff  to  focus  on  practicing  sound  forest\nmanagement  as  opposed  to  policing;  (iii)  enhancement  of  FD\u2019s  institutional  capacity  and\n                                               \n13  Loan 568-SRI: Community Forestry Project, for $10 million, approved on 25 March 1982, and closed on 30\nSeptember 1992.\n14  Loan 1183-SRI: Participatory Forestry Project, for $10.5 million, approved on 5 November 1992.\n15  Loan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project, for $16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.\n16   Postevaluation Office.

Asian\nDevelopment Bank, Manila.", "8\nparticipating  communities  by  restructuring  FD,  including  decentralizing  and  devolving  its\nauthority; and (iv) public awareness of the reform process for promoting people's participation in\nforest resource management activities. The lessons learned from the forestry related projects in\nSri Lanka and other countries are detailed in Appendix 3. Experience in the region indicates that\nparticipatory  and  community-based  national  resources  management  approaches  are  more\neffective than other methods in creating positive ecological and social impacts. Such impacts\ninclude improved soil conservation, stabilization of hydrological systems, and creation of wind\nshelters.\nE. ADB's Sectoral Strategy\n30. ADB's Country Operational Strategy for Sri Lanka (1998)17 recommends that sustainable\nnatural resources management should be one of the key areas for ADB\u2019s involvement to reduce\npoverty and ensure long-term sustainability of economic growth. Criteria that will guide ADB's\ninterventions include (i) achieving a balance between the economic and ecological functions of\nthe environment, (ii) addressing poverty-related causes of environmental degradation, and (iii)\npreventing and minimizing economic damage to existing environmental infrastructure. Forest\nand biodiversity conservation and management are focal areas for ADB\u2019s assistance, together\nwith sustainable development and management of coastal  resources  and  integrated  water\nresource management.\n31. ADB's policy on forestry encompasses three basic principles: protection, production, and\nparticipation. Based on these principles, ADB\u2019s assistance stresses activities that (i) enhance\nprotective functions of forests with respect to soil, water, and biodiversity; (ii) carry out cost\neffective  and  sustainable  harvesting  of  natural  and  plantation  forests;  and  (iii)  promote\ninvolvement  of  affected  communities  in  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  forestry\ndevelopment activities. Focus on interventions to reduce poverty as ADB\u2019s overarching goal has\nbeen highlighted in natural resources management projects and enhanced through employment\nof participatory approaches. Based on these considerations, the Project has been designed\nprimarily to improve livelihoods of poor rural people.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n32. The Government has formulated and adopted the NFP and gained experience from\nimplementing ADB-assisted forestry projects. The Government and ADB agrees that policy and\ninstitutional  reforms  with  an  enabling  legislative  framework  are  necessary  to  facilitate\nimplementation of the NFP. Priority actions in this context include (i) the deregulation of permits\nfor transport of timber grown by the private sector; (ii) private sector (both formal and informal)\nparticipation in harvesting, establishment, and management of state-owned plantations; (iii) the\ngranting  of  25  year  leases  or  management  rights  to  forestlands,  with  secure  tenure\narrangements for participating stakeholders, and delegation of power to the conservator of\nforests  (CF)  to  issue  such  leases;  (iv)  the  reorganization of  FD  to  establish and  practice\nsustainable  forest  management;  and  (v)  minimizing  of  the  intersectoral  incursions  that\nundermine the long-term sustainability of the national forests. For example, the promotion of tea\ngrowing under the small-scale tea farmers program has increased pressure on the national\nforests. The Government recognizes the need for comprehensive land-use planning and inter-\nsectoral policy coordination to minimize the negative impact of such externalities, and sees the\nProject as a means of addressing these issues.\n                                               \n17      STS: SRI: 98017: Country Operation Strategy Study, Sri Lanka, November 1998.", "9\n1.  Legislative Reforms\n33. The Government concurs that current legislation and regulations hamper integrated and\nsustainable development of the sector. Consequently, the Government has demonstrated its\nwillingness to revise the forest legislation and regulations to make them responsive to the NFP.\nThe Government has assured ADB that it is committed to reforms in legislation to facilitate (i)\npeople-oriented forestry and plantation development, and (ii) participation of the private sector.\nThe reforms are needed to enhance productivity and sustain forestry sector development. To\nthat end, the Government has also assured ADB that a new bill on forest legislation and\nregulations will be developed to facilitate deregulation of timber and  wood  harvesting and\ntransport.\n34. The Government stresses the importance of the role of local communities in sustainable\nforest  resources  management  and  the  need  for  their  access  and  participation.  Increasing\npoverty in rural areas, especially of the communities near the natural forests and plantations,\nhas contributed to continued degradation, deforestation, and encroachment. The Government\nhas agreed to issue appropriate instructions to guarantee private sector and local community\nparticipation in forest resources management. This will include (i) removing disincentives to the\nprivate sector for growing trees, such as the requirement of transport permits for privately grown\ntimber; and (ii) opening the harvesting and management of state-owned plantations through\ncompetitive bidding. The Government recognizes that for the forest sector to achieve its full\neconomic potential, policies that result in inefficient use of forest resources and commercial\nplantations must be reformed. The Government has agreed to phase out STC\u2019s monopoly on\nharvesting timber from the national forests over a period of three years.\n35. In this context, the Government has agreed to implement the following: (i) during 2001,\n2002, and 2003, STC will have guaranteed access to state forest plantations with annual\nharvesting rights over 1,200 ha (the level earmarked for 2000), provided the area harvested by\nSTC during 2001, equals or exceeds the 1,200 ha allocation. If STC is unable to meet the 2001\nharvesting target, the annual allocation  for 2002 and 2003 will be limited to the maximum area\nthat STC harvested during 2001;  (ii) for the remaining area (not less than 600 ha in 2002 and\n2003) that is available for harvesting under the existing management plans or the IFRMPs, free\nand open competitive bidding is to be available to STC and the private sector equally. The\nbidding will be conducted in accordance with open and competitive procedures that are to be\nintroduced  and  that  (a)  incorporate  appropriate  safeguards  (such  as  prequalification  of\nleaseholders, guarantees, and performance bonds), (b) ensure adherence to sound forestry\noperational practices, (reflecting the Forestry Code of Practice approved by the Food and\nAgriculture  Organization),  and  (c)  create  equal  opportunities  for  public  and  private  sector\nparticipation; and (iii) at the end of year 2003, STC\u2019s special allocation of harvesting rights will\nbe  reviewed by an  independent  committee  comprising  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  experts\nselected in consultation with ADB with the objective of enhancing private sector participation.\n36. In concert with a thorough public awareness campaign, the Government agreed  to\nderegulate the harvesting and transport of timber species grown privately, for eight rare and\nvaluable species. The deregulation, to be conducted nationwide, will occur in a phased manner\ncovering 49 species by the end of 2001, 18 more species by the end of 2002, and 60 more by\nthe end of 2003. The deregulation will be monitored annually and will eliminate excess stock\nexaminations  in  all  private  wood  enterprises  by  end  of  2001.  By  the  end  of  2003,  the\nGovernment will review the deregulation of jak18 timber harvesting and transport.\n                                               \n18\nJack Fruit tree.", "10\n2.  Reforms in Long-term Land Use/Lease Arrangements\n37. The Government has confirmed that long-term land-use and lease arrangements are\nessential for committed management by participating stakeholders and has agreed that long-\nterm leases and management rights will be given to all farmers participating in agroforestry and\nwoodlot programs and that leases will be cosigned by spouses, if both are living. The long-term\nland-use/lease  arrangement  (25  years)  with  cost-benefit  sharing  arrangements  has  been\nimplemented. The Government agreed that this practice would be improved through delegating\nforestland-leasing powers to the CF in order to minimize administrative delays and transaction\ncosts  to  potential  beneficiaries,  and  to  facilitate  instituting  participatory  sustainable  forest\nmanagement. Until the delegation is formalized, the CF will keep the Land  Commissioner\ninformed of lease proposals, and the Government agreed that the Land Commissioner will\nfacilitate the leasing process with the provision of renewal for another 25 years, if the lessee has\nperformed adequately. Rules and procedures for private sector leasehold management of state\nforest plantations, in line with the NFP, will also be adopted and formalized.\n3. Institutional Reforms\n38. The Government has agreed to reform FD. The MFE, in consultation with ADB, has\nproposed an institutional structure that is to be approved by the Government. The structure\nincludes the following, which have been accomplished: (i) the creation of four new positions to\nenhance the implementation of IFRMPs, (ii) the decentralization and devolution of appropriate\nadministration  and  management  authority  to  the  CF  and  regional  forest  officers  by  loan\nnegotiations, to facilitate effective implementation of the Project, and (iii) the constitution of a\nnational project implementation unit and the assignment of staff to the restructured FD at the\nnational, regional,  and district officers level. The reorganized FD is establishing an ecosystem-\nand  area-based  integrated  forest  resources  management  system  where  the  primary\nresponsibility  of  FD  staff  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  field-level  forest  management  and\ndevelopment  practices.  This  will  also  require  rationalization  and  realignment  of  the\nadministrative  and  forest  management  unit  boundaries  along  with  a  corresponding  staff\nredeployment program. In addition, organizational procedures for improved work planning and\nfor management information systems are to be implemented throughout FD.\n39. The details of the agreements reached with the Government in accordance with a time-\nbound action plan consequent to policy dialogue are given in Appendix 4.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n40. Poverty among forest dependent communities is closely linked with deforestation, land\ndegradation, and land and tree tenure  insecurities. Causes  of  poverty  in forest-dependent\ncommunities in the rural areas include unclear forest boundaries leading to insecure land and\ntree tenure, inadequate technical and extension capacity of the FD, and government decision\nmakers\u2019  lack  of  awareness  about  the  value  of  the  forests  to  livelihood  improvement  and\neconomic development. Because people do not have secure land and tree tenures, they do not\nmake long-term investments in forest and tree growing, and  limit  their  participation  in  the\nmanagement of forest resources that affect their life. The Project will help reduce deforestation\nand  degradation of  lands  and  soils  on  which  these  communities  depend  for  subsistence.\nMoreover,  strengthening  of  FD\u2019s  extension  and  technical  capacities,  in  conjunction  with\nboundary demarcation and integrated forest management, will increase their income generating\nopportunities.  The  Project\u2019s  participatory  approach  will  ensure  participation  of  forest\ncommunities,  NGOs,  and  CBOs.  This  will  accelerate  the  participatory  forest  resource", "11\ndevelopment and environmental awareness in which local communities see themselves as the\nbeneficiaries of the process. Close consultation and participation of local communities in forest\ndemarcation  and  delineation,  together  with  the  reform  in  long-term  forestland  lease\narrangements, will help create security of tenure for the poor households and in turn, will\nencourage a long-term productive investment.\n41. FD\u2019s  current  organizational  structure  and  decision-making  procedures  emphasize\nadministration and policing, which limits community participation in forest management. FD\u2019s\npreoccupation with administering a dispersed and undemarcated estate on its own has resulted\nin piecemeal efforts being made to improve forest management and productivity. Furthermore,\nthe STC monopoly on timber harvesting, and timber transport regulations, have discouraged\nprivate sector and local communities from becoming full partners in increasing production and\nimproving the management of the forest estate.\n42.   The  FSMP  lays  out  the  long-term  sector  development  priorities  and  investment\nstrategies.  This  is  complemented  by  the  new  NFP,  which  emphasizes  participatory  forest\nmanagement principles and is in line with ADB\u2019s forest sector policy. However, to implement the\nsector  approach  and  to  institutionalize  participatory  sustainable  forest  management,\ncomprehensive  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  are  required  and  must  be\ncomplemented by clear delineation and demarcation of the national forest areas.\n43. Moreover, to reduce poverty among the forest dependent communities, investments will\nbe needed to provide them with secure land and tree tenure. This effort can be strengthened by\ndelineating and demarcating of permanent forest estate, implementing institutional reforms to\nimprove governance and performance of the forest sector by enhancing community and private\nsector participation, and upgrading FD\u2019s operational and technological capacities for improved\nforest protection and production.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n44. The overall goal of the Project is to increase the value and sustainability of Sri Lanka\u2019s\nforests. The goal is to be achieved by creating a policy and governance framework that enables\nparticipation of local communities and the private sector in forest resource development and\nmanagement.  The  objectives  of  the  proposed  Project  are  to  (i)  establish  and  implement\nparticipatory sustainable forest management of demarcated permanent forests, to increase their\nprotection and production; and (ii) enhance access of the local communities (in particular, the\neconomically disadvantaged people) to gainful employment and human resource development\nopportunities, leading to poverty reduction.\n45. The Project will cover 17 of the 19 existing territorial forest divisions. If the security\nsituation improves, the Project will be extended to cover the remaining two divisions. The\nProject will support the first part of FSMP, to be implemented during seven years. The Project\nwill include activities aimed at implementing the NFP. Consistent with a sector approach and the\nNFP, the Project will help the Government improve forest sector governance by establishing\nlegal and functional boundaries of the forest areas. This will allow improved management and\nprotection. At the same time, timber transport and trade will be deregulated; the STC monopoly\non harvesting timber on state forestlands will be phased out; and local communities and the\nprivate  sector  will  be  involved  in  rehabilitation,  regeneration,  and  management  of  state\nforestlands and plantations.\n46. The Project will be implemented in about 10 subproject areas (SPAs), each covering up\nto three forestry divisions. A comprehensive study was successfully concluded in three core-\nSPAs (Anuradhapura, Badulla and Nuwara Eliya,  and  Ratnapura) during  the TA  identified", "12\nintervention packages for implementation under the Project. These interventions are equally\napplicable to the additional seven SPAs that have been selected. However, the work and its\nphasing will be tailored to specific needs and requirements of each SPA. Most SPAs conform to\nthe existing forest division boundaries, although divisions with similar agroecological features\nhave been combined to form a single SPA to ensure consistency with an integrated ecosystem\nmanagement approach. The other criteria for the constitution and selection of the SPAs include\n(i)  the  interventions  within  each  subproject  must  be  compatible  with  the  overall  project\nobjectives  and  interventions  in  the  core  SPAs;  (ii)  beneficiary  communities  must  have\nestablished their willingness and ability to participate; (iii) land ownership must not be disputed;\n(iv) each component must be technically feasible; (v) the areas for specific interventions must\nbe accessible; (vi) most potential beneficiaries should belong to landless and/or low income\nhouseholds and should be willing and able to participate; (vii) each subproject must have an\neconomic internal rate of return of at least 12 percent; and (viii) the potential environmental\nimpacts  must  be  within  acceptable  levels  as  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental guidelines,19 and should include the provision for mitigation, if necessary. FD will\napprove the remaining subproject feasibility reports as long as they are in conformity with the\ncriteria.\n47. The Project consists of three components; (i) participatory forest planning, management,\nand  awareness;  (ii)  sustainable  forest  resource  development  and  management;  and  (iii)\ninstitutional strengthening for improved sector performance.\n1. Participatory Forest Planning, Management, and Awareness\na.  Delineation, Demarcation, Survey, and Mapping\n48. In the 17 forest divisions covered, the Project will support surveying and demarcating\nboundaries with the close consultation, and participation of local communities. A total of 17,500\nkilometers (km) of surveying and demarcation will be completed to establish permanent forest\nareas and facilitate integrated forest resource management planning and implementation. The\ninitial estimates of the total periphery of the forest areas are 13,000 km for natural forests and\n4,500 km for the forest plantations, with priority given to the demarcation of blocks exceeding 20\nha. The procedure for surveying will involve community consultation to obtain a consensus\nabout the locations of forest boundaries. Concrete boundary pillars will then be installed. Next,\nthe survey maps and records will be updated. Consistent with the NFP management categories,\nFD will produce forest type and management maps based on the results of the participatory\nforest planning and demarcation process.\nb. Integrated Management Planning\n49. The SYIP will be implemented at the forest division level. The Project  will  support\npreparation of IFRMPs by FD in consultation with the participating stakeholders. IFRMPs will\ninclude  forest  mapping,  classification,  assessment  of  growing  stocks  and  assessments  of\nforests in terms of species diversity, as a basis for determining principal management regimes,\npractices, and annual harvesting levels. Moreover, IFRMPs will be developed for each forest\nmanagement  unit.  IFRMP  preparation  will  be  complemented  by  workshops  for  local\ncommunities and key provincial agencies, to link district development plans and land resource\ndevelopment initiatives to forest sector needs and priorities.\n                                               \n19 Asian Development Bank. 1991.

Enhancing  MFE\u2019s  and  FD\u2019s  capacity  for  implementing  an  effective  awareness  and\nextension campaign will strengthen their participatory forestry capacities. Assistance will be\nprovided to MFE and FD through equipment for the media unit, and the development of an\nawareness and extension program. The awareness campaign will highlight timber transport and\ntrade  deregulation  and  its  role  in  promoting  tree  growing,  sustainable  forest  resource\nmanagement, and the economic and financial value of forests. The campaign will also promote\nother policy and institutional changes to encourage participatory forest sector development.\nMedia campaigns pertaining to the role of forests and forestry in the well-being of people will be\ntargeted at planners, politicians, nonforestry institutions, and local communities. To support the\nawareness program, the Project, through the local schools, will help establish a network of\nenvironmental societies, with a total membership of 100,000 people.\n51. Demonstration plots will be established to introduce the best practices in forest and short\nrotation woodlot management, and in agroforestry, with a special focus on the participating\ncommunity members. Other government extension agencies, NGOs, and CBOs with requisite\ncapacity, will be mobilized to provide TA to the communities living near forest boundaries. The\nProject will help increase the productivity of agricultural crops and/or livestock, and provide\nother supporting services such as marketing intelligence and information.\n2. Sustainable Forest Resource Development and Management\n52. The Project  will  support  field  interventions  that  are  technically  appropriate,  socially\nacceptable, financially viable, and directly contribute to achieving the project objectives. Field\nactivities will include (i) participatory forest resource development and management of degraded\nand non-degraded forestlands, (ii) participatory rehabilitation and management of protected\nforests, and (iii) management of production forests.\na. Participatory Forest Resource Development and Management\ni. Community-Based Agroforestry and Social Forestry\nDevelopment\n53. The proposed agroforestry woodlot model will help reestablish permanent tree cover on\nshifting cultivation forestlands by improving tenurial rights. The Project will help the participants\nsecure long-term lease that cover at least 1 harvest cycle (rotation), provide tree seedlings for\ngrowing timber and fruit trees in combination with agriculture crops, and fund labor costs for tree\nplanting and maintenance over a two-year period. Beneficiaries will ensure protection and long-\nterm  maintenance  of  the  woodlots  during  the  first  rotation,  and  will  be  responsible  for\nestablishing the trees for a second rotation. FD will receive 20 percent of the final harvest from\nthe first rotation, to pay for woodlot establishment costs. Use of the agroforestry model will\nincrease  the  functional  boundaries  of  the  forest  estate;  enrich  local  agroecosystems;  and\ndiversify product and income streams, thus increasing the income to the local communities. The\nspecies mix and technical specifications to be developed during the participatory  land-use\nplanning exercise will be tailored to maximize benefits to women and other household workers\nwho currently contribute most of the labor to land management activities. CBOs/NGOs will\nfacilitate the exercise for households that have a lease agreement.\n54. This model is estimated to be implemented on 8,600 ha of smallholder agroforestry\nwoodlots. Of this area, about 2,500 ha are in the core SPAs with an indicative target of 6,100 ha\nin the additional SPAs. An estimated 7,500 households will benefit from the activity. Households\nheaded by women will participate through participatory land-use planning, decision making", "14\nabout species mix and management regimes, secure land and usufruct tenurial agreements in\ntheir names, and preferential targeting of project inputs such as FD\u2019s extension assistance. FD\nwill use these sites as demonstration models to extend improved coppicing and tree tending\ntechniques.\nii. Improved Management of Existing Woodlots\n55. The Project will assist approximately 8,000 farmers to increase their ability to generate\nincome from existing woodlots by providing support for establishment of long-term tenure to\ntheir plots. This support will include surveying of boundaries, their registration with FD, and\nprovision  of  technical  extension  and  marketing  to  support  improved  decision  making  to\nmaximize the value of existing crops and returns from the reforestation program. To reinforce\nand institutionalize FD\u2019s forestry extension capacity, Regional Forest Officers will develop a\nplanned and programmed extension package for woodlot lessees. The Project will support the\ndevelopment of demonstration plots on selected woodlots where farmers will be able to \u201clearn\nby doing\u201d woodlot maintenance and management. The Project will provide technical extension\nmaterials and manuals for distribution to participating farmers (including wall charts, marketing\ninformation services, and techniques for estimating the value of tree crops). The extension\nmaterials will be developed for both teak and eucalyptus woodlots. The total scope for improving\nexisting woodlot management is 7,300 ha, of which about 2,500 ha is estimated to be in core\nSPAs and 4,800 ha in the additional SPAs. The assistance to be provided by the consultants\nwill aim at increasing the plantation productivity and financial returns on investment.\niii. Rehabilitation and Management of Degraded Plantations\n56. Local  CBOs  and  beneficiaries  will  be  encouraged  to  convert  FD\u2019s  unproductive\nplantations into financially viable plantations. The Project includes the extraction of existing\ncommercial grade  timber or fuelwood,  and  reestablishment of  plantations  with  appropriate\nspecies mix and adequate post-planting maintenance. A total of 12,600 ha (equivalent to 40\npercent of the current area of productive plantations) will be rehabilitated and converted into\nproductive  and  financially  viable  plantations.  Site  preparation,  including  felling  and  stump\nremoval, will be bid out competitively. The core SPAs have about 3,800 ha of such sites, and\nthe additional SPAs about 8,800 ha more.\nb. Participatory Rehabilitation and Management of Protected Forests\ni. Buffer Zone Development for Multiple-Use Forestry\n57. The Project will support intensification of agricultural production and enhanced farm\nincomes in encroached areas as a means to reduce forest conversion. The Project will support\nthe delivery of extension services from appropriate agencies, development of community-based\nparticipatory land-use planning, building of conflict management capacity through provision of\nfacilitators, and group processes.  Existing  CBOs  will  be  fully  involved  in  such  processes.\nWherever  CBOs  cannot  be  found,  experienced  NGOs  will  be  involved  in  mobilizing  the\ncommunities  and  facilitating  farmer  participation.  Assessing  the  potential  uses  of  natural\nresources will be supported to determine allowable harvest levels and to develop strategies for\nbuffer zone land and biomass resource development. The Project will support such activities on\nabout 2,800 ha (1,400 ha in core SPAs and about 1,400 ha in the additional SPAs).", "15\nii. Enrichment Planting20 and Management of Protection and\nOther Natural Forests\n58. The Project will support FD\u2019s conservation operations and protection of the natural\nforests. This will include increased forest protection to encourage natural regeneration, and\nenrichment planting with appropriate species to enhance forest diversity. Under this component,\nenrichment  planting  will  be  carried  out  in  areas  where,  due  to  reduced  rainfall  and/or\ndegradation,  natural  regeneration  may  not  occur.  In  these  areas,  the  Project  will  support\nenrichment planting of appropriate species and monitor their development to identify the most\npromising species for natural forest restoration. This component is estimated to cover 1,300 ha\n(400 ha in the core SPAs and about 900 ha in additional SPAs).\nc. Production Forest Management\ni. Improvement, Rehabilitation, and Management of Degraded\nPlantations\n59. The Project will support FD to (i) upgrade existing and introduce new technologies for\nimproved planting stock production; harvesting techniques; and forest stand establishment,\nrehabilitation, and maintenance; and (ii) improve stand regeneration and restoration practices\nfor  establishing  and  managing  commercially  viable  plantations.  To  ensure  adequate\nregeneration and return on investments, and acceptable growth rates and yields, the Project will\nsupport three years of post planting maintenance. The Project will also support the import of\nseeds for improving the planting stock. Private sector participation in stand maintenance and\nharvesting will be facilitated using open tender systems to improve the cost effectiveness,\naccountability,  and  transparency  of  forestry  operations.  The  Project  will  support  the\ndevelopment of open tendering systems and train private sector contractors in the forestry\ncodes of practice to be adopted by FD. Harvesting techniques that reduce waste, including\ndirectional felling, will be employed. The total scope under this component is 5,600 ha (1,800 ha\nin core SPAs and 3,800 additional SPAs).\nii. Private Sector Pilot Leasehold Management of\nState Plantations\n60. The Project will facilitate pilot-level private sector investment in the management and\ndevelopment of state forest plantations. The Project will facilitate the transfer of management\nrights (including rights to harvest the existing stock) of plantations from FD to the private sector.\nThe areas to be transferred will be identified during IFRMP feasibility studies and private sector\nentities will be responsible for reestablishing and maintaining second rotation crops. The Project\nwill facilitate the involvement of up to five private sector entities, each to manage no less than\n1,000 ha of existing plantations and 200 ha of degraded plantations.\n61. The Project  will  support  FD  in  the development of  legal  documentation,  tendering,\ntransfer of assets, development of environmental safeguards and guidelines, and development\nof monitoring and evaluation processes. This will include the development of prequalification\ntechniques, development of an appropriate tendering and negotiation process, preparation of\nbid documentation, and the establishment of holding companies as appropriate. A total area of\n6,000 ha is included in this activity (about 2,400 ha in core SPAs and 3,600 ha in additional\nSPAs).\n                                               \n20 A method of planting seedlings under existing forest covers to enhance the forest\u2019s productivity and commercial\nvalue.", "16\n3. Institutional Strengthening for Improved Sector Performance\n62. This component consists of human resources development and technical support for\npolicy  and  institutional  reforms.  Human  resources  development  will  be  achieved  through\nappropriate training activities for FD staff and participating growers and farmers. FD\u2019s regional\nand divisional operations will be strengthened through provision of equipment and adequate\noperating  budgets.  Workshops,  seminars,  and  hands-on  training  for  the  participating\ncommunities will be included in this component. Women at all levels will be encouraged to\nparticipate in training and the Project will proactively try to ensure that at least 40 percent of\ntrainees at all levels are women. To facilitate increased decentralization in the reorganized FD,\nthe Project will provide facilities in the field for (i) three new regional deputy CFs along with\nnecessary equipment and resource inputs and offices and quarters; and (ii) the establishment of\noffices and quarters for one Divisional Forest Officer and one Regional Forest Officer.\n63. The  Project  will  help  upgrade  and  strengthen  the  training  capacities  of  Sri  Lanka\nForestry Institute (SLFI). First, a plan will be put  in  place  to  upgrade  the  knowledge  and\nexpertise of the institute teaching staff. On a rotating basis and over two years, each staff\nmember will be attached to a consultant team and will help prepare IFRMPs, thereby gaining\nfirsthand experience in applied forestry. The consultant team will provide hands-on training and\nensure  knowledge  transfer  to  the  SLFI  staff.  Then,  each  staff  member  will  undertake  an\nintensive training course in his or her area of specialization, including a two-month intensive\ncourse in teaching methods. In the second year, in addition to the in-class teaching, the trained\nstaff will assist the IFRMP teams in providing hands-on training to trainees and FD field staff.\nThis mode of training will orient new FD staff to the practice of forestry rather than purely\nadministration work. On completion of training, the foresters will be able to transfer their skills\nand knowledge to the other FD staff. Regional Forest Officer trainees will have at least six\nmonths of in-class training to consolidate their skills and knowledge base in applied forestry.\nSLFI facilities will also be expanded, including the construction of an auditorium.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n64. The Project cost is estimated at $40.0 million, of which $5.7 million is foreign exchange\ncost and $34.3 million is the local currency cost. Table 1 summarizes these cost estimates. The\ndetailed cost estimates are set out in Appendix 5.\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nComponent 1: Participatory Forest Planning, 2.3 14.5 16.8\nManagement, and Awareness\nComponent 2: Sustainable Forest Development 0.8 16.7 17.5\nand Management\nComponent 3: Institutional Strengthening for 2.2   3.1   5.3\nImproved Sector Performance\nTotal Base Cost 5.3 34.3 39.6\nInterest Charge 0.4  0.0   0.4\nTotal Cost to be Financed 5.7 34.3 40.0", "17\nD. Financing Plan\n65. It is proposed that ADB finance  $27.0 million equivalent (68 percent of the project cost)\nincluding $5.7 million of the foreign exchange costs and $21.3 million of local currency cost\nequivalent. The Government will provide $10.0 million in local costs including taxes and duties.\nIn addition, beneficiaries will contribute, in kind, a total of $3.0 million through labor for various\nreforestation activities. Table 2 summarizes the indicative financing plan.\nTable 2:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource of    Foreign Local Total Percent\nFinancing Exchange Currency       Cost\nADB        5.7        21.3        27.0        68\nGovernment        0.0        10.0        10.0        25\nBeneficiaries        0.0          3.0          3.0          7\nTotal        5.7        34.3        40.0      100\n66. The level of local currency for financing proposed by ADB takes into account the uncertain\nmedium-term economic prospects of the country and the Government\u2019s inability to finance a\nsubstantial proportion of the investment program. The program is required to enable Sri Lanka to\nmove to a higher level of development and reduce its high rate of poverty. In recent years, the\nGovernment has recognized severe limits on public sector financing of the country\u2019s investment\nprogram. Accordingly, the Government has taken a number of important actions to mobilize\nnonbudget investment, including an ambitious privatization program in key sectors such as civil\naviation, telecommunications, and the plantation industry. In 1997 and 1998, the Government\ncounter-guaranteed private sector borrowing on the international capital market under ADB\u2019s\nguarantee scheme. In addition, the Government has secured substantial private investment in\ncapital intensive industries such as power supply and ports. The Government, with ADB support,\nhas initiated an ambitious private sector development program in 2000, aiming to further privatize\nand restructure state-owned enterprises and address labor market rigidities to accelerate private\nsector investments and raise industrial productivity and cost efficiency.\n67. Nevertheless, the Government\u2019s capacity to self-finance the public investment program in\nthe coming years is expected to remain limited, as debt servicing and the costs related to the\nongoing civil conflict continue to absorb about 50 percent of budget outlays. The 1999 budget\ndeficit was 8.0 percent of GDP. While this was better than the 9.2 percent of GDP in 1998, it is still\nhigh. The deficit was largely because receipts from the goods and services tax introduced in 1998\nwere lower than anticipated and the outlays on capital investment and defense were higher. While\nthe Government intends to reduce the budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2002, in 2000, it has\nbeen projected at 7.6 percent of GDP, a slight improvement over 1999. Therefore, continued ADB\nsupport  for  local  cost  financing  is  justified  in  view  of  the  (i)  prevailing  difficult  country\ncircumstances, (ii) need for a substantial investment program to successfully move to a higher\ngrowth path, and  (iii) the Project\u2019s predicted impact on the level of poverty in the areas adjacent to\nthe natural forests.", "18\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization and Management\n68. MFE will be the Executing Agency for the Project. Within MFE, FD will carry out day-to-\nday implementation of the Project. To ensure effective implementation of the sector approach,\nan  adequately  staffed  national  project  implementation  unit  (NPIU)  and  a  project  steering\ncommittee (PSC) will be constituted at MFE. The NPIU will provide the required administrative\nand  implementation  support  to  FD  at  the  MFE  level  to  ensure  timely  and  uninterrupted\nimplementation of field activities. A project director was appointed before loan negotiations to\nhead the national NPIU. The project director is a senior officer with adequate technical and\nadministration experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB. Adequate administrative and\ntechnical staff will support the NPIU. The NPIU will be responsible for (i) overall coordination\nand liaison of project activities with departments and agencies outside MFE; (ii) administrative\nand implementation support to FD to ensure timely project implementation;  (iii) coordination of\nthe  submission  of  the first  two  subproject feasibility  reports  to  ADB for  approval,  and  for\nensuring that approval of the remaining subprojects is obtained in accordance with criteria\nagreed with ADB; (iv) assuring that the approvals for in-country and overseas training are\nprovided in a timely fashion; and (v) benefit monitoring and evaluation. MFE will provide office\nspace for consultants within its existing building and transportation support.\n69. Within FD, the officers to whom the required financial and administrative authority will be\ndelegated  will  implement  field  operations.  The  CF  for  operations  will  be  responsible  for\npreparation of  IFRMPs  and  the  subproject  feasibility  reports,  capacity  building  operations,\nprovision of guidance to the consultants, and implementation of all field activities through the\nrestructured FD in accordance with the prescriptions of IFRMPs. In the preparation of subproject\nfeasibility reports and the IFRMPs, the CF for operations will be assisted by (i) a technical\nservices team comprising FD\u2019s policy planning and monitoring, social forestry and extension,\nconservation and production, and law enforcement divisions; and (ii) a team of consultants.\n70. Regional project implementation units (RPIUs) with adequate professional and technical\nstaff will be set up at the regional levels, and divisional project implementation units (DPIUs) will\noversee day-to-day operations and supervise all field operations. The regional Deputy CF will\nhead the RPIU. Consistent with the IFRMP, each DPIU in consultation with the RPIU and\nparticipating  stakeholders,  will  prepare  an  annual  operating  plan  giving  the  physical  and\nfinancial dimensions of the activities. The NPIU, guided by the RPIUs, will aggregate this into a\nproject-level annual work plan and budget. The project director will ensure timely budgetary\nallocation and flow of funds to the operating levels. DPIUs will be responsible for microplanning\nand  monitoring  microlevel  Project  implementation.  The  organization  chart  for  project\nimplementation is provided in Appendix 6.\n2. Project Implementation Schedule\n71. The Project will be implemented over a period of seven years (2001-2007). The NPIU\nwas  established  and  adequately  staffed  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB  prior  to  loan\nnegotiations. The Government will ensure that the divisional forest officers have  adequate\nauthority,  especially  technical  and  management  decision  making  powers,  to  effectively\nimplement the activities prescribed in the IFRMPs. To ensure effective implementation, loan\neffectiveness will be contingent upon (i) establishment of the PSC, (ii) assignment of the CF for\noperations and his or her support staff, (iii) establishment of DPIUs in each core subproject\ndivision,  and  (iv)  preparation  of  proforma  agreements  for  implementing  partners.  The\nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 7.", "19\n72. The  first  year  of  Project  implementation  will  be  devoted  to  (i)  making  the  NPIU\noperational and constituting  the PSC at  MFE;  (ii)  mobilizing and  deploying personnel;  (iii)\nfinalization  of  the  new  forest  legislation  and  regulations;  (iv)  procuring  required  materials,\nequipment, and vehicles, and engagement of consultants; (v) initiating IFRMP processes, and\npreparation of feasibility studies for the first set of additional subprojects; and (vi) commencing\nthe surveys and delineation and demarcation of permanent forest estates. The preparation of\nfeasibility studies and IFRMPs for additional SPAs will be phased in within two years after\ninception. The CF in operations, with the assistance of the technical service team and the\nproject  consultants,  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  feasibility  studies  for  the  remaining\nsubprojects and the IFRMPs. This will be phased in over the first two years of the Project. This\nexercise  will  run  concurrently  with  the  three  core  subprojects.  The  first  two  additional\nsubprojects\u2019 feasibility reports will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval.\n3.  Beneficiary Participation\n73. Beneficiary participation and bottom-up planning have been incorporated in the project\ndesign to ensure full commitment and ownership by potential beneficiaries of the development\nactivities. The prospective beneficiaries must continue to participate in project implementation.\nOngoing  forestry  projects  and  pilot  projects  show  that  farmers  benefit  most  through  their\nparticipation in project planning and implementation. Participating  farmers  know that  these\nactivities  will  deliver sustainable  benefits  to  them,  although  not  immediately  after  the  tree\nplanting. The Project will provide financial incentives to the beneficiaries by providing them with\nseeds, seedlings, fertilizers, and extension information that has proven to be successful in\nenhancing the active participation of beneficiaries. Qualified CBOs/NGOs will be engaged by\nRPIUs to assist the active participation of beneficiaries. Criteria for selecting CBOs and NGOs\ninclude (i) experience relevant to the project activities, (ii) ties with the project area, (iii) financial\ncapability, and (iv) record of proven competence in group formation.\n4.  Subsidies\n74. The Project will provide incentives or subsidies amounting to $6.0 million  (15 percent of\nthe total cost) to farmers. The inputs for planting and maintaining trees on public land will be\nprovided free of charge, and farmers will be paid for their labor. Cost of the incentives will be\nrecovered in full through the sale of harvested trees on the basis of the cost-sharing formula\nagreed between the beneficiaries and FD. The subsidies are essential to encourage land and\nresource poor farmers to participate in the project implementation, and will have no recurrent\nbudgetary implications, as these will be terminated upon the completion of the Project. The\nsubsidies are justified because (i) most trees are to be planted on Government land and at a\ncost  20-30  percent  lower  than  that  of  the  traditional  reforestation  approaches;  (ii)  the\nenvironmental benefits of the Project in terms of increased soil and water conservation will\nexceed the cost of the subsidies; and (iii) a substantial proportion of the subsidized activities\ninvolve beneficiaries who are living below the poverty line and can not donate their labor at this\nstage.\n5. Project Coordination\n75. To  maintain  transparency  in  project  implementation  and  to  facilitate  national  level\ncoordination with various agencies and institutions, the PSC will be constituted prior to loan\neffectiveness. The PSC will be chaired by the secretary, MFE with the project director as the\nmember and secretary. Members will include directors of the External Resources Department,\nNational Planning Department of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, secretaries of related", "20\nministries,21 and NGOs. The PSC will meet every six months to discuss progress of project\nimplementation, identify and address constraints, resolve conflicts, and provide policy direction,\nif any.\n76. At the division level of FD, coordination will be provided by a divisional coordination\ncommittee (DCC) headed by the district secretary, with the Divisional Forest Officer as the\nmember and secretary and representatives of the concerned departments and agencies, CBOs,\nand participating NGOs as members. The DCC will be constituted prior to loan effectiveness\nand will meet every quarter to discuss progress of Project implementation, identify and address\nconstraints, resolve conflicts, and ensure that there is no duplication or overlap of Project\nactivities.\n6. Operational Maintenance\n77. MFE will be responsible for maintaining (and replacing if necessary) the Project facilities,\nincluding civil works, equipment, and other investments under the Project. The Government will\nensure that all additional staff required for maintenance of the project facilities are appointed in\na  timely  manner.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  provision  for  up-keep  and\nmaintenance is provided in each annual budget. Protection and maintenance of natural forests,\ncommercial plantations, and buffer zones in conservation areas and reforestation activities, will\nbe carried out through participatory arrangements with CBOs and private companies (in case of\nprivate sector commercial plantations) under the FD\u2019s overall supervision. The exact manner of\nprotection and maintenance will depend on the nature of the activity and will be governed by the\nterms and conditions of agreements and leases entered into with beneficiaries, CBOs, and other\nstakeholders.\n7. Project Reviews, Monitoring, and Evaluation\n78. Project  activities and performance are  to be  monitored  through  regular  reviews.  In\naddition  to  regular  ADB  review  missions,  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  and  detailed\nevaluation of the Project will be undertaken jointly by ADB, MFE, and FD in the third year. The\nmidterm review will be linked to completion of the feasibility studies for additional SPAs. Using\nbase  line  socioeconomic  data  generated  through  the  initial  social  analysis,  the  detailed\nevaluation will include (i) the assessment of the project design and scope as formulated at\nappraisal; (ii) enhancement of FD\u2019s capacity for effective implementation, and effectiveness of\nPIUs  in  implementing  the  Project;  (iii)  physical  and  financial  progress  of  implementation\n(including contracts and disbursements), and performance of consultants; (iv) performance and\nparticipation of CBOs, poverty reduction impacts, and level of women\u2019s participation; and (v)\nperformance of private sector enterprises. Based on these evaluations, the project design may\nbe modified and the project scope and implementation arrangements adjusted, and another\ncomprehensive review will be carried out in the sixth year of implementation to assess the initial\nimpact of the Project.\n79. Project evaluations will employ independent sample socioeconomic surveys with formats\nconsistent  with  the  1999  baseline  survey,  using  repeat  measurements  and  the  same\nparticipants.  In  addition,  the  harvests  in  farmers\u2019  agroforestry  woodlots,  and  commercial\nplantations will be surveyed, covering records of harvest, magnitude of participant benefits, and\nuse of forest-derived income. These data will serve as inputs to the benefit monitoring and\nevaluation of the Project. In addition  to  standard  socioeconomic  indicators  such as family\nincome and employment generation, benefit monitoring and evaluation will specifically include\n                                               \n21  Including the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, (under which ADB\u2019s proposed Protected Area\nManagement and Wildlife Conservation Project is being prepared), and the Survey Department and Land\nCommissioner Department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands.", "21\nquantifiable indicators of the participation of women and vulnerable groups in project activities.\nThe benefit monitoring and evaluation will take due account of the approaches and guidance\nprovided under the ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A Handbook for Bank Staff, Staff\nof the Executing Agencies and Consultants of March 1992.\n8. Procurement of Goods and Services\n80. All  supplies,  equipment,  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Most of the items to be procured, such as\nbasic equipment and materials (herbicides, fungicides, seeds, fertilizers, seedling bags) will be\nspread over a wide area in various subprojects and therefore will be procured centrally for cost\nefficiency. They will be procured in accordance with the Government\u2019s domestic procurement\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Supply contracts for equipment or materials not anticipated to\nexceed the equivalent of $500,000 will be carried out through international shopping. Other\nmiscellaneous equipment and supplies, with each package valued below the equivalent of\n$100,000, will be procured by direct purchase procedures.\n81. Civil  works  include  construction  of  the  SLFI  auditorium;  the  regional  offices  in\nAnuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya  and Badulla and Ratnapura; staff quarters in the field; and the\nroad  in Sinharaja  reserve forests.  As  qualified  local  contractors  are  available  and  foreign\ncontractors are unlikely to be interested in bidding, local competitive bidding procedures will be\napplied for civil works contracts. The Government has agreed to show that it has allocated\nannual maintenance budgets for regular upkeep of the roads and the buildings constructed\nunder the Project.\n82. Boundary  surveys  will  be  contracted  by  the  NPIU  following  the  demarcation  of\nboundaries in a fully participatory manner by FD. The demarcation will be carried out in close\ncollaboration with the Survey Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, which will\nsupervise the registered surveyors contracted by each forest division. Boundary demarcation\nwill be completed 15 months after the loan effectiveness. The Survey Department has agreed to\nwork closely with FD in implementing this component, and the two departments have signed an\nagreement to this effect. The Survey Department will (i) review the bidding documents and help\nthe project director collaborate with FD in prequalification and short-listing of firms based on the\nDepartment  Survey  regulations  cleared  by  ADB,  and  (ii)  supervise  the  field  work.  The\ncontracting will be through the project director using the Survey Department\u2019s usual contract\nprocedures and will involve a prequalification process, a performance bond, and provision to\nsupport field staff.\n9.  Consulting Services\n83. Consulting services will be provided by an internationally recruited consulting firm in\nassociation with a local consulting firm, engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements on the use of domestic consultants satisfactory\nto ADB. Services of NGOs will be acquired by MFE/FD in consultation with ADB based on\nagreed  criteria  acceptable  to  ADB.  Consulting  services  will  assist  project  implementation.\nConsulting services will comprise 77 person-months of international and 153 person-months of\ndomestic consultants. Appendix 8 provides the outline terms of reference for consultants.\n10. Training, Workshops, and Seminars\n84. MFE/FD, with the assistance of consultants and in consultation with other associated\nagencies, will prepare a comprehensive training program for ADB\u2019s approval within six months\nof loan effectiveness. The training will be undertaken within Sri Lanka as far as possible. The", "22\ntraining program will specify (i) the number of staff to be trained each year, (ii) criteria for\nselection of candidates, (iii) institutions proposed, (iv) types of training courses, (v) duration of\ntraining, and (vi) estimated cost. In supporting these training programs as a means to capacity\nbuilding, the officials who benefit from training will be assigned responsibilities commensurate\nwith the new skills they will acquire through the training. Accordingly, the trainees will have to\nagree to be retained in their positions in accordance with Government guidelines.\n85. Workshops  and  seminars  in  the  field  for  buffer  zone,  forest  protection,  farmers\u2019\nagroforestry  woodlots,  plantation  interventions,  public  awareness,  and  social  sensitization\n(including gender sensitization of CBOs and FD field staff and participants) will be coordinated\nand organized by SLFI, with expertise from appropriate sources. The workshops and seminars\nwill be targeted at CBOs and community organizers, village leaders, private sector investors,\nand the concerned FD field staff.\n11. Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n86. To ensure timely release of loan proceeds, an imprest account will be established in Sri\nLanka\u2019s central bank immediately after the effective date of the Loan Agreement in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of June 1996. The initial deposit will be based on\nestimated expenditures for the first four months of project implementation but will not exceed an\nequivalent of $200,000. The deposit will be used for payment of all eligible local and foreign\nexpenditures financed under the loan. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will\nbe used for reimbursement or liquidation of the advance in the imprest account, for expenditure\nunder contracts not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000.\n87. MFE will establish and maintain separate accounts for expenditure under the Project. All\nfinancial transactions for the Project, including those under the ADB loan, will be recorded\nseparately in the accounts in a manner that allows identification of expenditures on the project\nfacilities provided under the loan. The accounts, together with a record of expenditures, will be\naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of\nreference  are  acceptable  to  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards.  The\nauditor\u2019s opinion on the use of SOE procedures and the imprest account should be set out\nseparately in the audit report. Within one year after the end of the fiscal year, MFE will submit to\nADB, certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements.\n88. MFE will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB within one month\nand a half after the period under review. The reports will include information on the progress of\nproject implementation, the proposed program for the following quarter, problems encountered,\nand measures adopted for their resolution. The reports will summarize financial information\nsuch as Project expenditures incurred, withdrawal applications submitted, disbursements made\nunder the loan, and the Government budget allocations received. The reports will also be\nsubmitted to the PSC and DCCs. Within six months of the completion of the Project, FD will\nprepare a project completion report for submission to ADB.\n12. Advance Procurement Action\n89. Upon  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  Management  has  approved  advance\nprocurement action to facilitate timely implementation of the Project. Advance procurement\naction  was  required  for  procurement  of  urgently  needed  consultant  services;  materials,\nequipment, and vehicles, and preparation of bidding documents and finalization of  service\ncontracts for surveying, delineating, demarcating, and mapping of forests, as well as early\nestablishment of the media center at the MFE. These are time consuming processes and\nadvance procurement action will facilitate implementation of the Project\u2019s urgently required", "23\nactivities. MFE was advised that approval of advance procurement action does not commit ADB\nto finance the Project.\nF. The Executing Agency\n90. MFE, as the Executing Agency, has primary responsibility for policy planning, legislative\nand institutional reform, and monitoring. FD is responsible for forestry management. Both MFE\nand FD have satisfactorily implemented several externally funded projects. MFE is the core\nagency for environmental protection and natural resource management. MFE has staff with\nexperience in externally assisted projects. MFE has developed the SYIP that corresponds to\npart of the  FSMP; proposed promulgation  of  a forestry  ordinance  to  implement  the  NFP;\nsuccessfully implemented participatory and community forestry projects; and is implementing\nwatershed conservation projects. Thus, MFE has demonstrated the  required  technical and\nmanagerial  capability  to  implement  a  sector  project  to  meet  the  development  and  forest\nconservation challenges faced by the country.\n91. However, MFE and FD traditional structures and procedures emphasize a top-down and\ncentralized approach to forest sector development and decision making. The emphasis has\nbeen on protection and regulatory functions rather than improving the overall performance of the\nforest  sector.  MFE  has  had  limited  impact  on  influencing  the  cross-sectoral  policies  that\nadversely impact forest conservation and development. FD\u2019s current operational structures and\npractices provide limited opportunity for practicing participatory forestry. Furthermore, frontline\nforestry staff, who are often more in tune with the needs and challenges of forestry, have limited\ndecision making powers and thus often can not be proactive and innovative in their functioning.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  The Environment\n92. The  Project  is  classified  under  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental\nexamination (IEE) was undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.22 The\nIEE shows that no significant adverse environmental impact is anticipated and that a detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. The IEE also shows that the project design\nwill improve the quality of the environment and the welfare of the people living in the project\narea. Among the Project\u2019s positive contributions to the environment are (i) reduced soil erosion,\n(ii)  reduced  sedimentation of  reservoirs,  (iii)  increased  conservation  of  natural forests  and\nwildlife  sanctuaries,  (iv)  increased  coverage  of  plantation  forests,  (v)  increased  fuelwood\nproduction, (vi) better land-use planning, and (vii) efficient land tenure rights. The summary IEE\n(Appendix 9) was prepared and endorsed by the Government.\n93. The three core SPAs represent the major ecological zones in Sri Lanka: the dry zone\n(Anuradhapura district), montane zone (Badulla and Nuwara Eliya districts), and wet  zone\n(Ratnapura district). The three core SPAs demonstrate the different degrees and  types  of\ndependence of the communities on the forest reserves that subsequently reflect their levels of\nand strategies to cope with poverty.\n2.  Social Measures\n94. The 1994 demographic survey recorded 676,197 people in Anuradhapura dry zone\ndistrict. Farmers in the dry zone have fewer economic alternatives to escape poverty than\n                                               \n22  Asian Development Bank, 1991, Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agriculture and Natural Resources\nDevelopment Projects, Manila.", "24\nfarmers in other zones. Most households engage in shifting cultivation on state land, which\nsupplies about 30 percent of household income. Income from forest products was approximately\n5 percent of the total income across households. Anuradhapura District has the lowest average\nhousehold income among all districts in Sri Lanka in 1990. The average monthly household\nincome was SLRs2,600 ($35) compared to SLRs3,540 ($48) for Sri Lanka. The PPTA23 survey\nfound that 70 percent of all sample households receive Samurdhi (welfare) payments for the\npoor. The fluctuations in the income received by the farm households and its direct linkage with\nseasonality would have made a majority of the farmer households eligible for Samurdhi benefits.\nOf households sampled by the PPTA study, 38 percent were at or below the poverty line while\nmost farmers are just above poverty line. The 1994 survey estimates the population of 750,000\npeople in Badulla and 671,000 in Nuwara Eliya districts. According to the 1990/1991 survey,\nhouseholds in Badulla and Nuwara Eliya districts earned 80-84 percent less than the national\naverage of SLRs3,540 ($35) per month. The incidence of poverty in Badulla was 36.8 percent\nand  in  Nuwara  Eliya,  22.6  percent.  In  Badulla,  36  percent  of  children  aged  3-5  were\nunderweight in 1993. In Walapane Division in Nuwara Eliya District, 40 percent of the children\nwere underweight. Ratnapura District had 917,000 people in 1994. Communities near forest\nreserves in Ratnapura are less dependent on forest products due to tea production. The Tea\nLand Survey in 1994/1995 observed that 84 percent of the tea producers in Ratnapura District\nwere tea smallholders with less than 0.4 ha. The income received from tea ranged between 37\nand 58 percent of the household income for those owning 0.5-1.5 ha. A socioeconomic survey\nof 17 wet zone conservation forests showed that 90 percent of the households extracted forest\nproducts for their domestic use.\n95. The full participation of women will be needed to make any changes of land use in and\naround forest reserves. The Project will actively seek women\u2019s input in the integrated forest\nresource  planning  process  through  socioeconomic  surveys  of  household  uses  of  forest\nresources and resource inventories carried out by women. Buffer zone development activities\nwill  invite  the  participation  of  households  that  have  encroached  on  forestlands  and  offer\nassistance in tea production, leadership training, and savings mobilization. The assistance will\nhave a direct impact on household income and provide additional opportunities for women to\nparticipate in the market economy.\n96. Project interventions have been designed to encourage the communities to see the need\nfor  reducing  forest  exploitation  and  adopting  conservation  measures.  Public  awareness\ncampaigns will provide information on the value of local forests for (i) community water sources,\n(ii) rice irrigation, and (iii) creation of beneficial microclimates for tea production. At the same\ntime the Project will demonstrate that additional income can be generated through improved\nmanagement  of  the forest  reserves  and  long-term  investment  in  the  existing  smallholding\nwoodlots, tea plantations, home gardens and other cultivated land. The Project will complement\nongoing Government efforts to address widespread poverty among  its forest  communities.\nAppendix 10 details the social assessment on poverty alleviation.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic and Financial Analyses\n1.  Economic Analysis\n97. Economic analysis was carried out for the three core SPAs, which represent the major\nagroecological zones and are considered to be representative of the wider project area. To\nquantify costs and benefits associated with the distinct physical characteristics of each SPA, the\n                                               \n23   TA 3047-SRI: Forest Resource Management Project, for $800,000, approved on 20 July 1998.", "25\nmajor field intervention activities were grouped into (i) new agroforestry plots on encroached FD\nland, (ii) management of existing community woodlots, (iii) management of encroachment into\nbuffer zones and forest reserves, (iv) enrichment of protection plantations, (v) rehabilitation of\ndegraded FD plantations, (vi) improved management of teak and eucalyptus plantations, and\n(vii) pilot private sector concessionaires.  All costs and benefits have been divided into tradable\nand nontradable components. The former is expressed in border prices and the latter in the\nvalue of foreign exchange. The border prices were estimated from domestic prices using a\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9. The analysis is undertaken using with and without project\napproaches.\n98. The costs at the subproject level include those incurred in the physical development of\nthe  field  interventions,  including  extension  inputs,  planting  and  labor,  survey  and  lease\nagreements,  and  marketing.  In  addition,  costs  of  the  intermediate  services  and  goods\n(component 1) required to successfully implement the Project along with the prerequisite human\nresource development and institutional strengthening (component 3) are apportioned to the core\nSPAs (35 percent) and the additional SPAs (65 percent) based on the relative proportion of field\ninterventions. A standard conversion factor was applied to domestic prices in line with recent\nADB estimates. The opportunity cost of labor was derived from applying a shadow wage rate\nfactor of 0.8 to unskilled labor, which was converted to border prices by applying the standard\nconversion factor.24\n99. Direct and indirect benefits are included. The direct benefits are realized on-site, such as\nthe  value  of  incremental  output  of  commercial  logs  and  poles  and  of  limited  agricultural\nproduction. The indirect benefits are limited to the enrichment of protection forests in the upland\nagroecological zone and include the loss of hydroelectric generating capacity based on past\nlocal data sets. Where appropriate, income foregone is included as a negative benefit to reflect\nthe without project scenario. Several benefits are not quantified due to the paucity of data.\nThese include the value of additional carbon sequestration and the intrinsic value of habitat\nsaved from ongoing conversion to agricultural use. Carbon sequestration can be estimated but\nthere is little indication of a willingness to pay for the carbon sequestering potential within Sri\nLanka. Habitat values have been estimated for lowland wet zone forests; however these are not\nlikely to reflect the average willingness to pay for lesser-known sites in Sri Lanka. Without a\nsubstantial research project there is inadequate data to assign such values. The project benefits\nwill accrue from sustainable forest management that will provide logs, poles, and agricultural\ncrops. Border prices were used for valuing logs and were adjusted for transport and handling\ncharges.\n100. The estimated economic internal rates of return (IRR) for the core subprojects range\nfrom 13 percent for Badulla and Nuwara Eliya to 20 percent for Ratnapura. The variation reflects\nthe  differing  production  systems  and  the  high  proportion  of  rehabilitation  and  enrichment\nplanting in the Ratnapura SPA. Details are shown in Appendix 11.\n2.  Financial Analysis\n101. Financial viability was tested only for production systems that require a profit incentive\nfor the beneficiary to support the adoption in the project area. Four activities are analyzed, each\nwith the private sector as the primary beneficiary: (i) local communities convert the use of land\nfrom shifting cultivation to diversified agroforestry; (ii) involving woodlots owned or managed by\nlocal community members who have little or knowledge on silviculture or marketing of trees;\n                                               \n24 A shadow wage rate of 0.8 has been used following ADB\u2019s Loan 1716-SRI: Coastal Resource Management\nProject, for $40 million, approved on 7 December 1999.", "26\n(iii) the  intensification  of  agricultural  practice  in  encroached  land,  based  on  lowland  tea\nproduction; and (iv) the establishment of private sector forest concession operations.\n102. The characteristics of the production systems and the financial IRR calculations are\nshown in Appendix 11. The financial IRRs of 13-16 percent reflect the sustainability of the forest\nmanagement regime to meet the return on labor necessary to demonstrate that participants can\nafford  to  invest  their  labor.  The  analysis  is  based  on  partial  cost  recovery  through  labor\ncontributions from beneficiaries and the provision of free forestry materials.\n3. Risks\n \n 103. The  major  risks  to  the  Project  are  (i)  delays,  and  noncompliance  with  policy  and\ninstitutional reforms needed for better sector performance, (ii) failure of potential beneficiaries to\nactively participate, and (iii) inefficient coordination between relevant government agencies.\n104. Specific safeguards against these risks have been incorporated in the Project design.\nFor (i), some reforms may not be easily carried out due to the lack of understanding among\npeople and political resistance from vested interest groups. This risk will be minimized through\nan effective awareness and extension campaign. The Project includes assistance to establish a\nmedia unit and undertake an awareness and extension program to establish a constituency of\nbeneficiaries,  NGOs,  CBOs,  and  civil  society  to  demand  adherence  to  the  policy  and\ninstitutional reforms. It was agreed that public awareness campaign and extension program will\nbe undertaken within 6 months after loan effectiveness. Furthermore, frequent policy dialogue\nand close monitoring of the time- bound policy and institutional reforms and timely corrective\naction from ADB will minimize this risk. For (ii), the extension programs and financial incentives\nwill facilitate beneficiaries\u2019 participation. NGOs and CBOs are expected to play an important role\nin promoting the participatory approach to minimize the risk. For (iii), project implementation will\nbe carried out through several coordination mechanisms. Through close consultation among\nrelevant agencies the NPIU and DCC at the field level will serve as effective coordination\nbodies. MFE is experienced with coordinating various activities. Relevant agencies, including\nMFE and FD, have recognized that illegal logging and the high demand for industrial wood\ncontribute to forest depletion and have taken strong measures to avoid overexploitation by\ncommercial interests. This matter will be discussed during the coordination meetings.\nB. Environment\n105. The Project is designed to enhance the environmental conditions of the core SPAs,25\nand  is  to  be  undertaken  through  participatory  and  bottom-up  planning  approaches.  The\nenvironmental  impact  screening  has  not  identified  any  significant  adverse  environmental\nimpacts. Minor adverse impacts under the commercial forest management, which far outweigh\nthe benefits, can easily be mitigated.\n106. The  main  benefits  expected  from  the  protection  forestry  interventions  and  public\nawareness  and  extension  services  in  the  wet  zone  are  (i)  biodiversity,  soil,  and  water\nconservation in southwest Sri Lanka, an area with an unusually high concentration of species\nand with exceptionally high levels of endemism and over 95 percent of the country\u2019s threatened\nplant and animal species; (ii) global importance for the conservation of the world\u2019s floristic\ndiversity  in  the  highly  threatened  area  of  southwest  Sri  Lanka;  (iii)  the  awareness  of\nconservation among peripheral communities of protection and conservation forests and the\ngeneral public; and (iv) publication of information relevant to conservation and biodiversity.\n                                               \n25  Project interventions are expected to generate similar positive environmental benefits in the additional SPAs.", "27\n107. Reforestation provides a range of environmental benefits and services. Increasing tree\ncover can increase soil fertility by improving moisture retention, soil structure, and nutrient\ncontent. Tree cover helps to reduce rapid runoff of rainwater, thereby regulating stream flow and\nimproving  water  quality  by  reducing  sediment  in  surface  waters.  Incorporating  trees  into\nagricultural systems can improve crop yields by improving soil and the microclimate.\n108. Commercial plantation activities provide increased revenue to the Government, private\nsector involvement in plantation activities, and a continuous supply of wood from plantations.\nAgroforestry  woodlot  activities  will  reduce  the  area  under  shifting  cultivation  and  provide\npermanent supplementary income to farmers. Improvements to existing farmer woodlots will\nincrease the quality and quantity of wood coming to the market. The project interventions will\nimprove the protection, conservation, and management of forests urgently needing protection by\nreducing or halting the encroachments and illicit felling of timber. The Project will also increase\nthe awareness of conservation among peripheral communities and in the general public. If the\nProject is not implemented, the degradation of resources in these forest reserves will continue.\nThe proposed restructuring of FD will allow efficient management of forest resources in the\ncountry, which will contribute to the protection of the environment.\n109. The sustainable management of dry zone forest  reserves under the  social forestry\ninterventions  will  increase  the  benefit  flow  to  surrounding  communities.  Land  leased  for\nagroforestry woodlots will provide continued income to the farmers and discourage shifting\ncultivation. Improved management of existing woodlots will provide incentives for continued\nsmallholder management.\nC. Impacts on Poverty\n110. The Project will benefit about 50,000 households and directly generate about 6 million\nperson-days of work for the rural sector. It will have an impact on reducing poverty in the rural\narea, where 35 percent of the population live under the poverty line. The Project will increase\nemployment and income generation opportunities through increasing the activities within the\nforest and allied sectors. In rural communities, livelihood adjacent to forest reserves will be\nsupported in order to stabilize land use and create greater tenurial certainty over land and trees.\nIn Anuradhapura, approximately 2,500 marginal and landless women and men will receive long-\nterm leases to FD land for agroforestry plots and farmer woodlots (2,500 ha). The provision of\nsupplemental  income  from  the  wood  portion  of  these  plots  helps  to  reduce  household\nvulnerability during years of poor rainfall. About 2,500 farmers with woodlots will benefit from\ntraining and marketing activities, and will thus increase their income. An annual increase of\nhousehold income is estimated at SLRs1,000-2,000 ($14-27) depending on the agroforestry\nmodel.\n111. The forest reserve buffer zone development intervention will be implemented in critical\ncommunities of Ratnapura wet zone district to provide financial training and alternatives to\nexpanding the tea garden areas. Assistance for savings mobilization and access to existing\nfinancial institutions is expected to help tea smallholders manage their finances for other income\ngenerating activities. Additional interventions in Ratnapura include rehabilitation of degraded\nplantations (1,250 ha) and enrichment and management of protection forests (400 ha), which\nwill have a long-term impact on increasing income and reducing poverty.\n112.  A  total of about 50,000 beneficiary  household  will  directly benefit  from  the  Project\nthrough participation in the reforestation activities. Of the households in core SPAs, 40-65\npercent are below  the  poverty  line  and  will  benefit  from  improved  productive  activities  in\nforestlands, where they will have greater security of tenure, and from employment opportunities\ngenerated by the Project. By deregulating the sector operations and adopting multistakeholder", "28\nand  community-based  resource  development  and  management,  the  Project  will  help  the\nGovernment improve the governance of the sector by making all parties involved in the forest\nsector  more  accountable.  Furthermore,  the  operating  procedures  and  implementation\narrangements will ensure transparency. More importantly, institutionalization of participatory\nforestry management will help make benefit-sharing from forest resources more accessible to\nthe local poor and improve the socioeconomic status of the local communities. This will enable\nthem to  maximize  their  chances for  being  able to  access and  influence  the  development\nprograms and projects that can enhance their livelihoods.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n113.  The specific assurances are as follows:\n(i) MFE  and  FD,  in  consultation  with  the  Survey  Department  of  the  Ministry  of\nAgriculture  and  Lands,  will  prepare  a  time-bound  operational  plan  to  survey,\ndelineate,  demarcate,  map,  and  redraw  forest  boundaries  using  agreed  upon\necological criteria, and the MFE and FD will ensure that a management unit that\ncontains similar prescriptions is not split as a result of the demarcation.\n(ii)  During 2001, 2002, and 2003, STC will have guaranteed access to state forest\nplantations with annual harvesting rights over 1,200 ha (the level earmarked for\n2000) provided the area harvested by STC during 2001, equals or exceeds 1,200 ha\nallocation. If STC is unable to meet the 2001 harvesting target, the annual allocation\nfor 2002 and 2003 will be limited to the maximum area that STC harvested during\n2001. Free and open competitive bidding for the remaining area (not less than 600\nha in 2002 and 2003) that is available for harvesting under the existing management\nplans or the IFRMPs, is to be made available to STC and the private sector equally,\nin accordance with open and competitive bidding procedures. At the end of 2003,\nSTC\u2019s special allocation of harvesting rights will be reviewed by an independent\ncommittee comprising a multidisciplinary team of experts selected in consultation\nwith ADB, with the objective of enhancing private sector participation.\n(iii)  The  Borrower  will  issue  long-term  lease/management-rights  to  all  participating\nfarmers in the woodlots program, and ensure that (a) the CF has delegated power to\nissue  leases  over  state  land;  (b)  until  the  delegation  is  formalized,  the  Land\nCommissioner will facilitate the leasing process; and (c) for private sector leasehold\nmanagement  of  state  forest  plantations  rules  and  procedures  in  line  with  the\nNational Forestry Policy are adopted and formalized.\n(iv)  MFE  will  (a)  undertake  a  thorough  public  awareness  campaign  for  forestry\nmanagement  and  deregulation;  (b)  deregulate  nationally,  timber  and  wood\nharvesting and transport for agreed species found on private lands, in the agreed\nphased manner, with an annual review conducted jointly; (c) eliminate excess stock\nexaminations of all private wood enterprises by the end of 2001; and (d) conduct a\nreview by end of 2003 for deregulation of jak timber harvesting and transport with\nthe Ministry of Agriculture and Lands.\n(v)  By 31 December 2001, the Borrower will submit to Parliament, a bill to amend or\nreplace the Forest Ordinance and will approve associated regulations to bring the\nlegislative framework in line with the imperatives and strategies enunciated in the\nNational Forest Policy.", "29\nB. Conditions of Loan Effectiveness\n114.

Asian Development Bank (ADB) Projects in Sri Lanka\n1.  Community Forestry Project\n1. The Community Forestry Project,1 with $10.0 million financed by ADB, was completed in\n1991.  This  project  aimed  at  supplying  Sri  Lanka  with  needed  fuelwood  and  timber  from\nconventional reforestation in block plantations and a small social forestry component designed\nto  pursue  tree  cultivation  through  community  involvement.  The  Country  Synthesis  of\nPostevaluation in Sri Lanka2 rated the project as generally successful. The report concluded that\nthe project had made positive ecological impacts, including soil conservation, stabilization of\nhydrological systems, and creation of wind shelters.\n2. The project concept was sound, with a lower risk plantation component being combined\nwith a more innovative community forestry component. However, community participation in\nreforestation can only be fully achieved if the community is involved throughout the project cycle\nincluding the planning and monitoring phase. Tree planting can conflict with peak agricultural\nactivities,  which  should  be  considered  when  scheduling  implementation  and  determining\ncompensation. Individual farm households need immediate compensation, such as food for\nwork, to enable them to undertake tree cultivation, particularly during peak season for work on\nagricultural crops. To assure the needed level and means of community participation in a\nreforestation project, appropriate disciplinary expertise must be employed during the preparation\nof the feasibility study and appraisal. Participating families need secure rights and benefits to\nharvest final products with appropriate lease/management agreement.\n2. Participatory Forestry Project\n3. The ongoing Participatory Forestry Project3 commenced in 1993  and  was originally\nscheduled for completion in 1999. The project may be extended into 2000. The project is\ncofinanced  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  which  has\nprovided 30,000 tons of wheat as food aid. The food aid component is to provide farmers with\nas  compensation  for  time  spent  on  tree  planting  and  maintenance  activities.  The  main\nobjectives of the project are to increase villagers\u2019 incomes through participation in reforestation,\nto increase tree planting, and to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Forest Department\n(FD). This project built upon the lessons learned from the Community Forestry Project.\n4. ADB\u2019s midterm review in 1996 confirmed that the project had achieved 70 percent of its\nplanting target. By the end of project implementation, the planted area is expected to reach 150\npercent of the 15,000 hectares target.\n5. Useful lessons can be derived from the project implementation. For example, some\nleases do not extend until the harvest age of trees being grown, and most leases are signed by\nmen, although women play a critical role in woodlot establishment and maintenance. While FD\nhas demonstrated strong skills in meeting reforestation targets through the use of community\nlabor, the gradual shift of allowing farmers greater decision-making in woodlot designs and\n                                               \n1\nLoan 568-SRI: Community Forestry Project, for $10 million, approved on 25 March 1982.\n2  Country Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Sri Lanka, December 1997, Asian Development Bank.\n3  Loan 1183-SRI: Participatory Forestry Project, for $10.5 million, approved on 5 November 1992.", "Appendix 3, page 2\n41\nlonger-term rights over land and products should be encouraged. Successful and sustainable\nsocial forestry programs will depend on the strengthening of community groups and farmer\norganizations to develop their own methods for incorporating trees into farming systems.\n3. Upper Watershed Management Project\n6. The  ongoing  Upper  Watershed  Management  Project4  commenced  in  1998  to  (i)\nrehabilitate, sustainably manage, and protect critical watersheds; (ii) improve incomes of project\nbeneficiaries; and (iii) strengthen the capacity of watershed management agencies, including\nFD. The project is currently being implemented and is performing satisfactorily.\nB. Other External Assistance to the Forestry Sector in Sri Lanka\n1.  Forest Resources Development Project\n7. The World Bank and the Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA) invested\n$11.4 million between 1983 and 1986 for the Forest Resources Development Project. The\nobjectives were to (i) prepare a forest master plan (FMP), (ii) conduct a forest inventory and\nestablish a data base, and (iii) strengthen FD\u2019s institutional capacity. Although the FMP was\nadopted  in  1990,  it  was  criticized  for  not  being  based  on  adequate  consultation  with\nstakeholders, lacking in conservation orientation, and being too concerned with the production\naspects of forestry. However, the FMP did provide a valuable data and technical base to\nprepare subsequent planning in the forestry and forest industries sector. This led to planning of\nthe Forestry Sector Development Project, described next.\n2.  Forestry Sector Development Project\n8. The World Bank, FINNIDA, the United Kingdom\u2019s Overseas Development Administration\n(ODA),  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  invested  $46.4  million\nbetween 1991 and 1996 to help the Government improve the performance of the forest sector in\nline with Sri Lanka\u2019s economic, social, and environmental requirements by implementing five\nyears (990-1994) of the FMP. The project objectives were to (i) achieve intensive management\nof plantations and natural forests, (ii) establish an environmental management system, (iii)\nexpand the forest resource base by establishing new plantations, (iv) augment professional and\ntechnical education and training of farmers, and (v) strengthen FD\u2019s institutional base. The\nproject developed a forest sector master plan that provides a long-term sector development\nframework from 1995 to 2020, taking into account lessons learned from the FMP and putting\nmore emphasis on participatory approaches in forestry resource management.\n9. The implementation completion report summarized the lessons learned as follows: (i)\nplantation sites should be clearly identified in order to ensure land is available for plantations; (ii)\nthe performance of FD was not satisfactory, in part due to understaffing, outdated financial\nregulations,  and  over-centralized  decision-making;  (iii)  realistic  interventions  should  be\nenvisaged  (including  more  private  sector  participation)  as  a  result  of  institutional  capacity\nanalysis; and (iv) any sector reform needs to overcome possible strong resistance from vested\ninterest groups.\n10. The World Bank expressed concern at the lack of progress in addressing important\npolicy  issues such  as  review  of  stumpage  charges  and  restructuring  of  the  State  Timber\n                                               \n4  Loan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project, for $16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.", "Appendix 3, page 3\n42\nCorporation (STC). It was recognized that these issues needed to be addressed in future as an\nintegral part of any investment projects in the forestry sector, to allow them to yield positive\nresults.\nC. Lessons Learned and their Incorporation in the Project\n1. Deregulation of Forest Related Activities\n11. Many  forest-related  activities,  including  transportation  of  timbers  and  harvesting  of\nconsiderable  numbers  of  species  grown  on  private  land,  are  currently  subject  to  strict\nregulations. Deregulation should be promoted to enable the field-level FD staff to be more\nactively involved in forest resource management activities with local communities, rather than in\nlegal enforcement activities.\n12. The Government agreed that regulation of timber and wood felling would be phased out\nwith specified time-bound targets. The targets specify the names and numbers of species that\nwill be exempt from permits nationwide at the agreed time. In year three, the jak felling and\ntransport will be deregulated and the findings of the review used to guide the decision making\nabout possible deregulation of felling jackfruit trees. The Project, at the same time, will support\nthe development of media capacity and campaigns for public awareness about the benefits of\nderegulation and other policy reforms.\n2. Delineation and Demarcation of the State Forests\n13. Ambiguousness in the boundaries of state forests has encouraged encroachment and\nillicit harvesting. Clear delineation and demarcation of the forests and appropriate legislation is\nimperative for more efficient and effective enforcement forest boundaries and to protect the\nremaining natural forest. This is also a prerequisite for planning and implementing integrated\nforest resources management.\n14. A  bill  will  be  introduced  in  the  Parliament  to  amend  or  replace  the  1907  Forest\nOrdinance and approve associated regulations with provisions for classification forests under\nFD\u2019s jurisdiction. The Project will support the demarcation of legal boundaries on the ground\nthrough the surveying and demarcation of the forest in close consultation and participation of\nlocal communities. A total of 17,500 km of surveying and demarcation will be completed to\nestablish a permanent forest area and facilitate integrated ecosystems based forest resource\nmanagement planning and implementation.\n3. Institutional Reforms\n15. To facilitate integrated forest resource management at regional level, FD\u2019s institutional\ncapacity should be enhanced through organizational restructuring including decentralization and\ndevolution  of  authority  and  redeployment  of  field  level  staff.  The  Government  agreed  to\nestablish four regional Conservators of Forest (CFs), devolve the authority to regional CFs, and\nto divisional, range, and beat forest officers, and rationalize the head office structure in line with\nthe decentralization. Range and beat boundaries will be redrawn to ensure appropriate and\neffective integrated forest resource management.", "43\nAppendix 3, page 4\n4. Monopoly of the State Timber Corporation (STC)\n16. Distortion and inefficiency of markets results from STC\u2019s de facto monopoly. STC enjoys\na monopoly on harvesting and sale of wood from state natural forests and plantations. Because\nSTC pays a very low stumpage fee, STC has not had to become commercially oriented and\ninstitutionally  efficient.  Efforts  to  establish  a  more  fair,  competitive,  and  efficient  market\nenvironment are of particular importance.\n17. The Government  will  promote  private  sector  participation  in  all  forestry  operations,\nincluding harvesting, reforestation, and silviculture of state-owned plantations through an open\ncompetitive bidding process. To enable STC to adjust to a competitive environment, the annual\nminimum area for harvesting will be allocated to STC for the next three years. At the end of\nProject year three, the protection of STC will be independently reviewed.\n5. Rights for Land Use\n18. Beneficiaries of existing social forestry have expressed concerns about their rights to\nland-use because the lease and management agreements are not extended until the trees\nreach a harvestable age; and required periodical renewal of targets. New legislative framework\nwill  be  introduced  to  allow  appropriate  leasing/management  contract  arrangements  that\nauthorize FD to enter into partnerships with smallholders and private sector firms for longer term\nmanagement agreements for tree farms, woodlots, and plantations. These contracts will be\ncosigned by both spouses (if both are living).\n6. Public Awareness\n19. Public awareness is key for promoting participation in forest resource  management\nactivities and for the success of policy and institutional reforms, which may attract resistance\nfrom vested interest groups. The Project will support the development of media capacity and\nmedia campaigns for public awareness about the benefits of deregulation and other policy\nreforms by assisting the establishment of a media center within the Ministry of Forestry and\nEnvironment.\nD. ADB's Forestry Sector Projects in Other Countries\n1.  Bangladesh5\n20. In Bangladesh, severe population pressure has resulted in continued deforestation and\ndegradation of the country's remaining forestry resources. Bangladesh has received substantial\nexternal  assistance  for  forestry  since  1980.  This  includes  two  ADB  projects  (Community\nForestry Project in 1981 and Upazila [Thana] Afforestation and Nursery Development Project in\n1989)6,  both  of  which  aimed  at  promoting  people-oriented  forest  development.  Given  the\ncontinued  resource degradation  and  deficits faced by  country, the  Government,  with ADB\nassistance, formulated  the  Forestry  Sector  Mater  Plan  (FSMP),  which  provides  an  overall\nstrategy for forest sector development through policy and institutional reforms and investment\nplans for over 20 years, incorporating a people-oriented forest resource management approach.\n                                               \n5\nLoan 1486-BAN: Forestry Sector Project, for $50 million, approved on 21 November 1996.\n6     Loan 555-BAN(SF): Community Forestry Project, for $11 million, approved on 3 December 1981 and Loan 956-\n        BAN(SF) Upazila Afforestation and Nursery Development Project, for 43.5 million, approved on 30 December\n1989.", "Appendix 3, page 5\n44\n21. ADB approved the Forestry Sector Project in 1996. It is the first major intervention to\npromote forest resource management activities in line with the FSMP. The Project adopted a\nsector approach because of the importance of institutionalizing sustainable forest management\nthrough local community participation, accompanied by institutional capacity building and policy\nreforms. The sector approach was justified by the need to enhance the institutional capacities of\nFD, executing agency of the Project. The scope of the Project includes (i) institutionalization of\ncommunity participation in forest management, thereby increasing overall wood production and\npromoting forest conservation, and (ii) enhancement of capacity of FD and nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs).\n2.  Pakistan7\n22. The capacity of Pakistan\u2019s forest sector to meet the country's wood demand was being\nseverely reduced by the rapid depletion of forests, largely due to the country's rapid population\ngrowth (3 percent a year). The Government had implemented a number of externally funded\nprojects, but they were only partly successful in mitigating the high rate of depletion of the\nforestry  resources.  With  the  aim  of  developing  long-term  solution  to  the  problem,  the\nGovernment  in  1992  prepared  an  FSMP  with  ADB's  assistance.  The  FSMP  describes  a\ncomprehensive forest sector development strategy.\n23. ADB approved the Forestry Sector Project in 1995 as a first major effort to implement\nPakistan\u2019s FSMP. The Project was formulated using a sector approach to expand the models of\nbeneficiary in designing, planning, and implementing project-related activities, which had been\ntested under past projects. This approach was to develop an institutional environment and apply\nthese  models  consistently  in  all  forestry  activities  throughout  the  targeted  provinces,  thus\nensuring  the  sustainability  of  forestry  resources.  Community-based  organizations  were\norganized and involved in the design and execution of the integrated resource management\nplans, including participatory village lands-use planning within the subprojects.\n24. Further enhancement of institutional capacity of the Department of Forests, Fisheries,\nand Wildlife (DFFW), the executing agency of the Project, was an important component of the\nProject; while DFFW had demonstrated its  capability  to  implement forest  projects,  several\nactivities were identified to make DFFW to be better prepared to meet the requirements of social\nforestry with its decentralized and community-oriented mandate. Legal reform was also required\nin the context of the Project so that the legal framework for the forestry sector would be\nconsistent with the Government's policy, and complement and provide an impetus to the full\ndevelopment of social forestry.\n                                               \n7\nLoan 1403-PAK: Forestry Sector Project, for $42.6 million, approved on 9 November 1995.", "POLICY REFORM AND IMPLEMENTATION MATRIX\nPolicy Reforms/Issues Proposed Action Action by Action Date Risks/Constraints\n1.

Introduction\n1. This report presents the summary initial environmental examination of activities proposed\nunder the Forest Resource Management Project (the Project). The report is based on information\ngathered during the feasibility study, review of reports available in the core subproject areas\n(SPAs), and data collected by the project preparation technical assistance team. The three core\nSPAs, corresponding to the existing forest divisions, were selected to represent the various\nclimatic  and  ecological  conditions.  This  report  follows  the  initial  environment  examination\nprocedures developed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and listed in ADB\u2019s Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Agriculture and Natural Resources Development Projects, 1991 and\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review, 1993.\nB. Description of the Project\n2. Selected core SPAs are in the north central dry zone, the southwest and center of the\nlowland wet zone, and the up-country wet and intermediate zones. The objectives of the proposed\nProject  are  to  (i)  assist  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and  Environment    (MFE)  and  the  Forest\nDepartment  (FD)  in  their  efforts  at  sustainable  development,  effective  protection,  and\ndecentralized management of forest resources by facilitating establishment of a permanent forest\nand  instituting  appropriate  ecosystems-based  integrated  resource  management,  including\nparticipatory  rehabilitation and  management of  degraded  natural  forests  and  plantations;  (ii)\nprovide support to people-oriented forestry and private sector participation in forest resource\ndevelopment and management; and (iii) strengthen the capacity of MFE and FD as well as the\ncommunity-based organizations, and enhance their institutional effectiveness.\n3. To achieve the objectives, the Project will support the implementation of the Five-Year\nImplementation Plan in 17 of the 19 forest divisions.1 Activities to be supported include the\nForestry Sector Master Plan and National Forest Policy that are directly linked to the project\nobjectives of integrated ecosystem-based forest resource management.\n4. The Project follows a sector approach. The selected SPAs conform to the existing forest\ndivisions, with some of the divisions being combined because of their similar agro-ecological\nfeatures. Other criteria for constituting the SPAs include (i) size, (ii) security, (iii) resource base,\n(iv) willingness of the communities to participate, (v) population pressure, and (vi) environmental\npriority.  Three  core  SPAs  (Anuradhapura  Division,  Badulla  and  Nuwara  Eliya  divisions\n[combined], and  Ratnapura  Division),  were  selected for  a  detailed  assessment  during  the\nfeasibility study as they appropriately represent the nature and distribution of forests in the\ncountry and the entire range of proposed interventions. The additional seven SPAs include the\nremaining secure 13 forest divisions and exclude divisions that are otherwise inaccessible or do\nnot conform to the agreed selection criteria.\n5.  The identified activities for each SPA include (i) agroforestry woodlots, (ii) improved\nmanagement  of  existing  woodlots,  (iii)  improved  management  of  commercial  forests,  (iv)\nrehabilitation and management of degraded plantations, (v) private sector management of state\n                                               \n1\n   Because of the lack of access and security concerns in the remaining two divisions of (Ampara and Vavuniya),\nonly 17 were included in the Project.", "57\nAppendix 9, page 2\nplantations, (vi) enrichment and management of protection and other natural forests, and (vii)\nbuffer zone and encroachment management, including multiple use forestry.\n6.  In addition to the investment interventions, the Project will support the legal definition of\nboundaries through surveying (delineation) and demarcation of the national forests. A total of\n13,800 kilometers of surveying and demarcation will be completed to establish a permanent forest\narea  and  facilitate  integrated  ecosystems-based  forest  resource  management  planning  and\nimplementation.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies\nthrough  institutional  reforms,  including  institutional  restructuring  and  streamlining  of  FDs\u2019\nadministrative systems to provide the organizational needs of the wider sector policy. Support\nservices will include capacity building, and public awareness and extension. The Project will\nsupport preparation of an integrated forest resources management plan to develop a participatory\nplanning and operational basis for integrated forest resource management at the divisional level.\nC. Description of the Environment\n7. The project activities will be carried out in three core SPAs representing all agroclimatic\nzones of the country: Anuradhapura (dry zone); Badulla and Nuwara Eliya (wet and intermediate\nzones), and Ratnapura (wet zone).\n1. Physical Resources\na. Topography\n8. Most of the forests in the Ratnapura core SPA have a parallel ridge and valley topography\nwith an east-west trend. The general elevation of the division ranges from 30 to 2,135 meters (m)\nabove mean sea level. In Badulla-Nuwara Eliya SPA, elevation varies from about 900 to 2,400 m\nand the SPA has a variety of complex of landform features such as mountain ranges, plateaus,\nplains, valleys, and slopes. Topographically, Anuradhapura  core SPA belongs to the  lowest\npeneplain with gently undulating lands. The average elevation of the area is 178 m.\nb. Geology and Soil\n9. Ratnapura SPA has a highland series of Precambrian rocks that are widely distributed in\nthe northern part of the division. The southern part has two important rock types: a southwestern\ngroup of meta sediments and a highland group of khondalites and charnokites. The predominant\nsoil type in Ratnapura division is \"red-yellow podsols (ultisols). This soil type is found in steeply\ndissected, hilly, and rolling terrain and is developed on a wide variety of parent materials. In\nmountainous areas, red-yellow podsolic soils and mountain regosols are found.\n10. Badulla-Nuwara Eliya SPA belongs to the highland series of the Precambrian complex.\nThe major rock types are quartzites, marble, and granites. The dominant types of soil include red-\nyellow podsols, reddish-brown latosols, and immature brown loams and regosols. The red-yellow\npodsolic soils are widely distributed throughout Nuwara Eliya. Anuradhapura division belongs to\nthe highland series of Sri Lanka, and its underlying rocks are charnokite, quartzite, and marble.\nThe soil in the dry zone is classified as an alfisol, which broadly corresponds to the reddish-brown\nearths. Chemically, this soil type is considered moderately rich soil but poor in phosphorus and\nnitrogen.", "Appendix 9, page 3\n58\nc. Climate\n11. Ratnapura SPA receives between 3,810 and 5,080 millimeters (mm) of rainfall annually,\naveraging more than 3,000 mm, and has no dry season. The highest rainfall and the lowest\ntemperature  are  recorded  in  Nuwara  Eliya.  Watawala  receives  the  highest  annual  rainfall,\nexceeding 5,588 mm. Nuwara Eliya experiences the lowest monthly average temperature of\nabout 7.2\u00baC, and the temperature occasionally falls below freezing. The average annual rainfall in\nBadulla is around 2,000 mm. The average annual temperature of the division varies between\n20.0\u00baC and 25.0\u00baC depending on the altitude. Anuradhapura\u2019s dry zone has an annual rainfall of\n1,329 mm and mean annual temperature of 27.3\u00baC.\n2. Ecological Resources\na. Forest Cover\n12. The latest forest inventory (1992) showed dense natural forest cover in 24 percent of Sri\nLanka\u2019s land area, and 7 percent of the land covered with sparse, open forests. The FD and\nDepartment of Wildlife Conservation control the natural forests.\n13. Nearly 14 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s land area is protected area. All categories of reserves\nmanaged by the Department of Wildlife Conservation are regarded as protected areas. The man\nand biosphere reserves, protection and conservation forests (30), Sinharaja World Heritage Site,\nand  Knuckles  and  Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya  forest  reserves  managed  by  FD  are\nconsidered to be protected areas.\n14. Forest  resources  in  Ratnapura  SPA  include  a  large  number  of  high-value  forest\nreserves\u201449,038 hectares (ha) of proposed forest reserves and forest reserves. Badulla-Nuwara\nEliya SPA has the smallest area of natural forests (38,392 ha of proposed and existing reserves)\nof the three core SPAs, and Anuradhapura, the largest (180,776 ha). However, the forest reserve\narea in the north and eastern portion of the division is not accessible at this time due to terrorist\nactivities.\nb. Forest Formations\n15. Vegetation in Ratnapura SPA can be classified as lowland rain forest, submontane and\nupper montane rain forest, wet patana grassland, and tree savanna. The dominant vegetation\ntype is lowland rain forest. The lowland wet zone forests in Ratnapura SPA are classified as Wet\nEvergreen Forest Climax, Wet Tropical Evergreen Forest, Toona-Dipterocarpus-Mesua series.\n16. The  vegetation  of  the  submontane  area  in  Ratnapura  is  described  as  the  Toona-\nCalophyllum-Syzygium series. The forests of this series are shorter  than  lowland evergreen\nforests; lack huge large buttressing roots; and have a large number of species descending from\nupper altitudes, in particular the family Lauraceae.\n17. Natural vegetation in Badulla-Nuwara Eliya SPA includes submontane rain forest, upper\nmontane rain forest, tree savanna, and dry patana grassland. The vegetation of the submontane\nforest is described as the Toona-Calophyllum-Syzygium series. Physiognomically, the forests of\nthis series are shorter than the lowland evergreen forests; lack large buttressing roots; and have a\nlarge number of species descending from upper altitudes, in particular the family Lauraceae. The\nupper montane rain forests in the core SPA replace the lower montane rain forests above 1,500\nm. The upper montane rain forests are rich in epiphytes, orchids, mosses, and filmy ferns. The\ntrees are stunted, with umbrella-shaped crowns and twisted branches. The forest is single-storied.", "59\nAppendix 9, page 4\nUnderstory vegetation is sparse due to lack of sunlight, which cannot penetrate through the dense\ncanopy.\n18. Natural  vegetation  in  Anuradhapura  core  SPA  includes  dry-mixed  evergreen  forest\n(synonyms: monsoon forest, seasonal forest, and moist deciduous forest); scrublands; riverine\nforest; villu grassland; and tree-savanna. The dominant forest is dry-mixed evergreen of shorter\nstature and with less biomass than lowland rain forest. It is also deciduous to a considerable\ndegree. Dry mixed evergreen is the most widespread forest formation in Sri Lanka and is very\ncharacteristic of the lowland dry zone below 600 m.\nc. Biodiversity\n19. The southwestern part of Sri Lanka (Galle, Kalutara, Matara, and Ratnapura) is one of the\n18 \u201chot spots\u201d of the world because of the high number of endemic plant species. Among the flora\n(3,600 flowering plants), as much as 23 percent of plant species are endemic to Sri Lanka, and 94\npercent of the endemics are confined to the forests in low and upcountry wet zones. Eighteen\npercent of the ferns and 16 percent of the terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to the country, and\nmost of them are contained in natural forests of the wet zone. Closed canopy natural forest covers\naround 10 percent of the wet zone land area and occurs in blocks scattered throughout the area.\nSri Lanka has 426 threatened flowering plants. The 1997 National Conservation Review survey\nrecorded 216 species of threatened flowering plants in the wet zone forests.\n20. The fauna exhibits a similar pattern of endemicity and distribution. The number of species\nand the percentage of endemic species in some faunal groups are as follows: fish, 59 (of which 27\npercent are endemic); amphibians, 37 (51 percent); reptiles, 139 (50 percent); birds, 237 (8\npercent); and mammals, 85 (14 percent). The vast majority of endemic species, particularly\namong fish, amphibians, and reptiles, are confined to the wet zone forests.\n3. Human and Economic Development\n21. According to the demographic survey of Sri Lanka in 1994, the population in Ratnapura\nDivision was 917,349. The rate of population growth in Ratnapura was estimated to be about 1\npercent annually from 1990 to 1994. In Anuradhapura, the total population in 1994 is 676,197.\nFarmers in the dry zone have few economic alternatives to farming. Most households engage in\nshifting cultivation on state land, which supplies about 30 percent of household income. Women\nand children provide most of the labor for cultivation while men attend to rice paddies, either their\nown or as wage laborers. Landless households (those with only sufficient land for a home and\nsmall  garden,  generally  less  than  0.1  ha)  are  potential  participants  in  smallholder  forest\nmanagement in the dry zone.\n22. Anuradhapura has the lowest average household income in Sri Lanka (SLRs2,600 per\nhousehold versus SLRs3,540 nationwide). In recent surveys (1997), 45 percent of children under\nthe age of five were malnourished, with 26 percent stunted. Because of the displacement by the\nethnic conflict in the north and east of the country and dependence on farming in an area of\nseasonal and varied rainfall, the populations are vulnerable to starvation and malnutrition.\n23. The population of Badulla and Nuwara Eliya is 749,549 and 671,344, respectively, based\non the 1994 demographic survey. Of the population, 56 percent live in the rural villages and 38\npercent on the estate plantations. The Tamils, who live mostly on the estate plantations in Nuwara\nEliya, comprise 44 percent of the population. Outside the estate plantations, the great majority of\nthe population are Sinhalese.", "Appendix 9, page 5\n60\n24. The highland areas dominated by the tea estates are populated by Indian Tamil estate\nworkers. The primary earners (with low wages) in the family are women who are employed as tea\npickers from 10 to 12 months a year.  Men are barely able to find work for three months in the\nyear. As an alternative, they turn to encroachment on state lands for vegetable and potato\nproduction.\n25. The middle hill areas are predominately occupied by Sinhalese. Men are the primary wage\nearners in agriculture and marketing.  Women tend home gardens, process saleable foods, and\nengage in handicrafts. The 1990/1991 Household Income and Expenditure Survey in Badulla and\nNuwara Eliya shows earnings are 80 to 84 percent less than the national average.2 The incidence\nof poverty was 36.8 percent in Badulla and 22.6 percent in Nuwara Eliya. Nationally, the average\nis 30.4 percent.\n4. Quality of Life Values\n26. The percentage of poverty is highest in the rural areas (35 percent), and lowest in the\nurban areas (18 percent). Malnutrition is widespread, especially among children and mothers. The\n1993 and 1994 Sri Lanka Food Balance Sheets show low average availability of calories per\ncapita from all food sources against a recommended minimum of 2,100 calories per day. The\ninfant mortality rate (up to age one) is 16 per thousand births. Of the 17 divisions where project\nactivities  are  being  carried  out,  6  are  considered  educationally  disadvantaged  divisions:3\nAnuradhapura, Badulla and Nuwara Eliya, Hambantota, Monaragala, and Polonnaruwa.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Environmental Benefits and Mitigation Measures\na. Environmental Impacts due to Project Location\n27. The Project will support the survey and demarcation of permanent forest estates, which\nincludes  surveying  the  boundaries  of  forest  reserves,  proposed  forest  reserves,  and  FD\nplantations. The establishment of forest reserve boundaries using a participatory approach will\ncreate awareness of the importance of reserves and discourage further encroachments. This will\nimprove the biodiversity and soil and water conservation in all protection and conservation forests\nidentified by National Conservation Review in the wet zone. Management of the protection and\nconservation forests will restrict encroachment for tea cultivation. Development of buffer zones in\nprotection and conservation forests and other forest reserves will benefit communities with limited\naccess to forests.\n28. Selection of land for farmer woodlots in the dry zone may cause land-use conflicts if not\ndone through a participatory process. The area of land for grazing and food production could be\nreduced. The development of agroforestry and plantations  may cause  significant social and\nenvironmental impacts if the locations are not properly selected. The use of FD land for farmer\nwoodlots under the participatory forestry program will raise the issue of short- or long-term tenure\nagreements and usufruct rights. Effective participation of people depends on their rights to the\nplanted trees and tenure for at least one rotation. The commercial plantation management activity\nwill also have a positive impact on the environment. Proper care, however, will be needed in the\nselection of sites with high productive potential and accessibility.\n                                               \n2  The 1990 national average was SLRs3,549 per month.\n3\nEconomic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka, 1998. Central Bank of Sri Lanka.", "61\nAppendix 9, page 6\nb. Potential Environmental Impacts due to Harvesting\nand Reforestation\n29. Agroforestry plots for production of wood and agricultural crops near settlements facilitate\nfarmers\u2019  access  to  these  goods  and  reduce  pressure  on  forests  (illegal  felling  and\nencroachments). Increasing tree cover can increase soil fertility by improving moisture retention,\nsoil structure, and nutrient content. Incorporating trees into agricultural systems can improve crop\nyields by improving soil and the microclimate.\n30. The establishment of large commercial plantations may cause adverse environmental\nimpacts during site preparation. The impacts may include accelerated erosion, disruption of the\nhydrologic cycle, compaction of soil, loss of nutrients, and a decline in soil fertility. Many of these\nimpacts can be short-term until the vegetation cover is reestablished by replanting. The severity of\nthe impacts depends in large part on site conditions prior to planting, site preparation techniques,\nspecies to be planted, treatments during rotation, length of rotation, and harvesting methods.\nReforestation in dry areas can deplete soil moisture and lower the water table. Soil compaction\nand damage can occur during the harvest season and site preparation. Erosion can occur in\nplantations with incomplete canopy closure or limited undergrowth. Accumulation of leaf litter\nunder plantations increases the risk of fire and decreases rainwater infiltration. In monocultures,\ntree leaf litter may change the chemical and biological characteristics of the soil.\nc. Potential Environmental Impacts Associated with Project Design\n31. Dry zone reserves under the Project will be  managed through participatory  land-use\nplanning in communities within and surrounding the reserve. The lands will be identified for\nmultiple uses such as forest protection, grazing, and agroforestry woodlots (AFWs). Priority will be\ngiven to individuals and communities within or in the periphery of the six reserves. AFW models\nwill need to be properly established to suit selected sites in the dry zone and fulfill the farmers\u2019\nneeds to avoid potential adverse environmental impacts. Evaluation of existing AFW models and\ndesign and testing of new models in the dry zone can provide lessons on how to minimize\npotential  adverse  impacts.  At  present,  people  collect  poles  and  fuelwood  from  abandoned\nswiddens, degraded forests, and scrublands. It may be important to survey the demand for poles\nand fuelwood before establishing plots in an area.\nd. Potential Environmental Impacts from Construction\n32. The civil works under this Project will include (i) the construction of (a) three units of 150\nsquare meters (m2) for regional offices in Anuradhapura; (b) quarters for the divisional forest\nofficers in Matara, Nuwara Eliya, and Ratnapura; (c) three offices (one at the range forest officer\nlevel and two at the beat forest officer level); and (d) an auditorium (400 m2) at the Sri Lanka\nForestry Institute, Nuwara Eliya; and (ii) improvement of the access road to Sinharaja forest\nreserve to enhance protection and facilitate ecotourism. Construction activities will generate noise\nand dust that could be significant when close to a populated area. Therefore, selection of sites will\nbe important consideration to mitigate the impacts. Access roads for harvesting and reforestation\nof commercial forest plantations in the upcountry wet and dry zones should be designed to\nminimize soil erosion during rainy season.\n33. Improvement of the access road to Sinharaja forest reserve will result in better protection\nof the resource, as it will facilitate inspections by senior FD officers. To avoid potential adverse\nimpacts from excessive numbers of visitors, FD will regulate the number through a permit\nsystem  that  will  be  monitored  closely.  Potential  impacts  of  erosion  resulting  from  road\nimprovement works can be avoided by ensuring adequate and well designed drainage along the", "Appendix 9, page 7\n62\nroad. Given the high rainfall in the area, the side and cross drainage will have to be constructed\nin concrete to safeguard the environment and enhance longevity of the improved road.\ne. Potential Environmental Impacts from Project Operations\n34. No major adverse environmental impacts are expected during the project operational\nphase. The socioeconomic impacts of social forestry interventions will be monitored regularly.\nHarvesting and reforestation of teak and eucalyptus plantations will have several adverse impacts.\nThe major impact due to harvesting and reforestation of eucalyptus plantations in the upcountry\nwet zone (Nuwara Eliya) is soil erosion. These impacts can be avoided by adopting appropriate\nand environmentally sound harvesting and reforestation techniques.\n2. Plantation Development and Mitigation Measures\na. Environmental Enhancement and Proposed Mitigation Measures\n35. Demarcation and marking of forest reserve boundaries in the wet zone, using concrete\nposts and participatory forest management, are expected to minimize the encroachment into\nforest. Protection forestry interventions will increase awareness among villagers in buffer zones of\ntargeted protection and conservation forests.\n36. Support services, training of MFE and FD field and head office staff, and reorganization of\nFD into a more responsive and effective structure will increase the performance of the forest\nsector. Deregulation of cutting and transport permits for timber and timber-based products will\nreduce transaction and compliance costs that currently impede and distort productive investment\nin the sector.\n37. A  workshop with farmers  in the  targeted  area generated proposals for new woodlot\nmodels. These are (i) an agroforestry model with low-density timber trees at 280  trees  per\nhectare, which would retain 50 percent growing space for annual crops and would allow farmers\nto plant about 20 fruit trees per hectare; and (ii) an agroforestry model designed to produce poles\nand crops.\nb. Mitigation Measures for Harvesting and Reforestation Impacts\n38. Environmental impacts of harvesting and reforestation could be mitigated using low-impact\nlogging  techniques  and  reforestation  with  species  matched  to  site  characteristics  on  an\nappropriate time schedule. Project interventions will improve forest protection and conservation,\nforest management, and forest plantation management.\n39. Soil  erosion  is  the  anticipated  negative  environmental  impact  of  harvesting  and\nreforestation of eucalyptus plantations in the upcountry wet zone is soil erosion. This can be\nmitigated in several ways: (i) replanting as soon as possible after cutting of trees, (ii) avoiding\nclear-cutting of large areas, (iii) limiting harvest to seasons of low rainfall, (iv) planning of felling to\nminimize log skidding and avoiding skidding logs parallel to the slope, (v) stabilizing skid trails\nafter use, and (vi) using animals or cable logging systems instead of skidders for extraction.\nKeeping branches and other debris on the ground can mitigate the loss of nutrients from the\nharvested area. Planting cover crops and adding fertilizer to compensate for nutrient loss is also\nrecommended.\n40. It is extremely important to monitor the harvesting and reforestation of teak and eucalyptus\nplantations  to  ensure  that  loggers  and  harvesters  adhere  to  the  contracts  designed  in  the", "63\nAppendix 9, page 8\nmanagement  plan  for  each  plantation,  to  minimize  environmental  impacts.  Frequency  of\nmonitoring depends on site conditions and the extent of the plantation. A trained forester will\nmonitor actual harvesting at least weekly.\nc. Overall Environmental Benefits\n41. The  main  benefits  expected  from  the  protection  forestry  interventions  and  public\nawareness and extension  services  in  the  wet  zone  are  (i)  biodiversity,  and  soil  and  water\nconservation in southwest Sri Lanka (being a concentration area of species with exceptional\nlevels of endemism and over 95 percent of the country\u2019s threatened plant and animal species); (ii)\nglobal importance (for conserving the world\u2019s floristic diversity in the biodiversity problem area of\nsouthwest Sri Lanka); (iii) awareness among peripheral communities and the general public of the\nneed for  protection  and  conservation  forests;  and  (iv)  publication  of  information  relevant  to\nconservation and biodiversity.\n42. The  sustainable  management  of  dry  zone  forest  reserves  under  the  social  forestry\ninterventions will increase the benefit to surrounding communities. Land leased for AFWs will\nprovide continuing income to farmers and discourage shifting cultivation. Improved management\nof existing woodlots will provide incentives for continued smallholder management.\nE. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n43. MFE will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate and supervise policy and planning\nreforms. Implementation of field and technical activities will be  conducted  through  FD.  An\nappropriately qualified project administrator at MFE will be appointed by the Government for\neffective implementation of the Project.\n44. A project management unit (PMU) will be constituted at the national level. The project\ndirector will head the PMU, and four conservators of forests will be members. The NPIU will\nassist the national project director by providing necessary technical and administrative support\nto the conservators of forests in the field, to ensure effective and timely project implementation.\nThe national project director, with assistance of the PMU, will be responsible for the overall\ncoordination and planning of project inputs, outputs, and activities, including (i) coordination with\nthe project administrator at MFE, and  with other  projects  and  programs  in  the sector;  (ii)\npreparation of feasibility study reports for the additional subprojects and their submission to\nADB through the project administrator; (iii) assistance to the project administrator in drawing up\nspecifications and tender documents for centralized procurement of all materials, equipment,\nand vehicles required by the Project as well as for the survey, delineation, demarcation, and\nmapping  contracts;  (iv)  maintenance  and  submission  of  project  accounts  to  the  project\nadministrator for onward submission to ADB; (vi) drafting and approval of contracts within its\nauthority  and  submission  of  contracts  not  within  its  authority  for  approval  to  appropriate\nauthorities;  (v)  review,  compilation,  and  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  and  other\ndocuments  to  the  project  administrator  for  reimbursement  by  ADB;  (vii)  engagement  of\nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  the\nGovernment procedures; (viii) selection of participants for in-country and overseas training in\nconsultation with relevant agencies; and (ix) preparation of quarterly and annual reports for\nsubmission to ADB and the appropriate Government agencies through the project administrator.\nThe government will ensure that the project administrator and national project director have the\nassistance of administrative and other support staff to ensure efficient and effective delivery of\ntheir responsibilities.", "Appendix 9, page 9\n64\n45. To  facilitate  national  level  coordination  with  various  agencies  and  institutions  and\nmaintain transparency, a project steering committee will be set up at the national level within\ntwo months of loan effectiveness.\n46. At the forest division level, coordination will be provided by a divisional coordination\ncommittee headed by the divisional secretary, with the division forest officer as the member\nsecretary and representatives of the concerned departments and agencies as members. The\ndivisional coordination committee will meet quarterly each year to discuss the progress of\nproject implementation, identify and address constraints, resolve conflicts, and ensure that there\nis no duplication or overlap in project activities.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n 47. Comprehensive  periodic  reviews  and  detailed  evaluation  of  the  Project  will  be\nundertaken jointly by ADB, MFE, and FD in the third year (linked to completion of the feasibility\nstudies for additional SPAs) and the sixth year of implementation.\n \n48. Using FD\u2019s available biodiversity baseline data, the sixth year evaluation will include the\nimpact of project interventions on biodiversity in the natural forests. This evaluation will require\nsample measurements of the permanent sample plots established by FD in the natural forests\nwithin the SPAs. This activity will be carried out in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Protected Area\nManagement and Wildlife Conservation Project. The Project will support the dry zone farmers\nby leasing state lands for social forestry activities and including them in a participatory process\nto manage forest reserves in Anuradhapura.\n49. The Project is designed in harmony with the environmental conditions of the core SPAs\nand  is  to  be  undertaken  through  participatory  and  bottom-up  planning  approaches.  The\nenvironmental impact screening has not identified significant adverse environmental impacts\nexcept under the commercial forest management.\nG. Conclusions\n50. Commercial plantation activities provide increased revenue to the Government, private\nsector involvement in plantation activities, and a continuous supply of wood from plantations.\nAgroforestry  woodlot  activities  will  reduce  the  area  under  shifting  cultivation  and  provide\npermanent supplementary income to farmers. Improvements to existing farmer  woodlots  will\nincrease the quality and quantity of wood coming to the market. The project interventions will\nimprove  the  protection,  conservation,  and  management  of  high-priority  protection  and\nconservation forests by reducing or halting the encroachments and illegal felling of timber. It will\nalso increase the awareness of conservation among peripheral communities and the general\npublic. If the Project is not implemented, the degradation of resources in these forest reserves will\ncontinue. The proposed restructuring of FD will allow efficient management of forest resources in\nthe country.", "65\nAppendix 10, page 1\nSOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n1. The  forest  in  Sri  Lanka  is  being  seriously  depleted  through  overexploitation  by\ncommercial interests and traditional users, and through inadequate management by the\nForest Department (FD). Most of the forest\u2019s users are seriously disadvantaged by their\npoverty, lack of organization and information, lack of secured access to productive resources\nsuch land and tress, lack of capital, and low levels of effective access to social services and\ninfrastructure. They have little direct access to markets, and are not organized to voice their\nviews  regarding  the  state  of  the  forest  or  its  management.  While  there  are  some\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  are\nworking among the forest communities, their programs show lack of focus on sustainable\nmanagement of the forest resources. Without dialogue and effective working arrangements\nbetween FD as the legal custodian of the forest and the forest-dependent communities who\nare  mostly  poor,  the  current  alarming  trends  will  surely  continue.  Thus,  participatory\nmanagement  strategies  fully  involving  all  stakeholders  will  need  to  be  developed  and\nimplemented.\n2. Social  development  concerns  such  as  gender,  poverty,  and  participation  was\nincorporated into all stages of project preparation. Poverty, gender, and participation issues\nwere basic to approaches used in socioeconomic and forest community data collection. The\nthree core subproject areas (Anuradhapura, Badulla-Nuwara Eliya and Ratnapura) were\nstudied in detail. The social and economic issues were reflected in the selection and design\nof the agroforestry and woodlot programs, land lease arrangements, land-use planning and\nboundary survey.\nA.  Socioeconomic Profile of the Forest Communities in the Project Areas\n3. Anuradhapura  District  has  the  lowest  average  household  income  in  the  country\n(SLRs2,600 per household per month compared to SLRs3,540 nationwide). Indicators of well\nbeing show the rural dry zone population to be vulnerable. In recent surveys (1997) 45\npercent of children under the age of five were malnourished with 26 percent of them stunted.\nDisplacement by the ethnic conflict in the north and east of the country as well as the\ndependence on farming in an area of seasonal and varied rainfall has created vulnerable\npopulations. Although land is relatively abundant with only 83 people per square kilometer\n(km2), parcels of irrigated land are small. In areas with no irrigation, where agriculture is\nhighly unreliable most households depend on seasonal wage labor. The majority of the\ntargeted beneficiaries of social forestry interventions engage in shifting cultivation; about two\nthirds have irrigated rice fields. The incidence of poverty is high. Of households sampled by\nthe project preparatory technical assistance team, 38 percent were at or below poverty line\nwhile most farmers were just above the poverty line. The farmer households are highly\nvulnerable to income fluctuations and weather, and thus 70 percent of them depend on\nSamurdhi welfare benefits. Most households have encroached on lands, but hesitant to put a\nlong-term investment in them for productive purposes. Approximately 2,500 marginal and\nlandless farm households will receive long-term leases to FD land for agroforestry plots and\nfarmer woodlots (2,500 ha) in Anuradhapura. Cost sharing will be provided for establishing of\nthe tree portion of the leased plots, which also permits annual cropping. The provision of\nsupplemental income from the wood portion of these plots helps to reduce household\u2019s\nvulnerability during years of poor rainfall. Greater participation of the community in land use\nplanning and decisions regarding forest reserve land use provides opportunities to invest in\nimproved grazing and other resources that can provide sources of income not dependent on\nrainfall. Improved management of existing woodlots will target more than 2,000 participatory\nproject farmers who have planted teak.", "Appendix 10, page 2\n66\n4. Population density in Nuwara Eliya was 354 per km2  in 1981. Over 70 percent of the\nNuwara Eliya population and over 80 percent of the Badulla population are engaged in\nagriculture,  fisheries,  or  forestry.  Population  pressure  in  highland  areas  has  led  to\nencroachment on forest reserves for vegetable cultivation. The area under highland tea is\ndeclining as eroded land is moved out of tea production and new planting takes place for\nlowland tea. Improved management of commercial plantations will target planting 1,155 ha of\neucalyptus and rehabilitating and managing an additional 1,381 ha of degraded plantations.\nSocial forestry interventions are limited to improvement of existing farmer woodlots and\nforest reserve buffer zone development in areas of high priority. Because of land scarcity and\nthe need to protect existing forest reserves, FD can not reserve land for agroforestry or\nfarmer woodlots. The project will benefit a total of 2,749 woodlot farmers through training and\nmarketing activities.\n5. The population density in Ratnapura is 700 people/km2. Due to population pressure,\nthe area under forest cover has been declining and with much of the remaining forest occurs\nin isolated fragments. The region is highly integrated into a cash crop economy with tea,\nrubber, cinnamon, and coconut as principal cash crops. The beneficiaries of the project in\nthis area live in the periphery of the forest reserves. Most of them cultivate tea and other\ncash crops, such as rubber and cinnamon. Although the incidence of poverty is low, there\nare pockets of poverty where 13 percent of the population are at or below the poverty line.\nMost residents, regardless of income levels, have encroached on lands. The high labor\ndemand for tea cultivation and steady income derived from tea sales has reduced rural\nhousehold dependency on forest product sales. However, many rural households continue to\nharvest forest products, especially fuelwood and timber, for home consumption.\nB.  Gender and NGOs/CBOs Participation\n6. In the dry zone, households headed by women have fewer wage labor options and\nare paid lower wages. Much of women\u2019s income comes from agricultural activities. Training\nfor agroforestry plots, which seeks to stabilize shifting cultivation, will be targeted to women\nfarmers. The Project will ensure equal opportunity for women and men to sign/cosign the\nland tenure leases. The participation of NGOs and CBOs in the project preparation and\nimplementation will enhance the effectiveness of project intervention to reduce poverty.\nC.  Social and Economic Benefits as Perceived by the Project Beneficiaries\n7. To see the possible benefits of the project to the poor, the staff consultant during\nappraisal investigated the beneficiaries of the 1998 social forestry project initiated by FD in\nMaha Hamillawa, Kahatagasdilliya in Anuradhapura District. The beneficiaries of the recent\nsocial forestry project perceived the following short-term (immediate) and long-term benefits\nthrough the project (tables A10.1 and A10.2).", "67\nAppendix 10, page 3\n1.

Economic Analysis\n1. The economic analysis for the Project focuses on the three core subprojects, which are\nassumed to represent the range of physical conditions that prevail in the project areas and affect\ndevelopment and/or rehabilitation of natural forests and plantations. Specific field interventions\nwere identified for implementation at each core subproject area (SPA) and were deemed replicable\nin the agro-ecological zones of the sector project. The results of the economic analyses of the core\nsubprojects are deemed sufficient  to  reflect  the  likely  range  of  returns for  the  whole project\nincluding the SPAs. The economic analysis makes the following assumptions with respect to\nforeign exchange rate, opportunity cost of labor, subproject costs, subproject benefits, and period\nof analysis.\n(i) Economic Prices: Economic border prices (world price) are used in the economic\nanalysis. Costs and benefits were broken into traded, nontraded, labor, and tax\nfactors and converted to world prices. For nontradables, a standard version factor of\n0.9 was applied to derive economic prices, which is consistent with recent standard\nconversion factors (SCFs) applied in Asian Development Bank and World Bank\nprojects. Economic prices were estimated by identifying the tradable (e.g., logs and\ntea) and nontradable output.  The  economic  price  of  timber  (Table A11.1)  was\nderived from the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price in local currency adjusted\nfor transport and handling costs; domestic prices were adjusted to border prices\nusing the SCF. The prices for internationally traded commodities are based on\nWorld Bank commodity price projections and adjusted for quality differences. The\neconomic prices for nontradables were derived from their financial prices that are\nassumed to remain unchanged in real terms (constant 2000 prices).\n(ii) Labor: The Government minimum wage rate is SLRs135 per day; however, casual\nworkers demand a daily wage of between SLRs185 per day (with food and transport\nprovided)  and  SLRs200  per  day  (excluding  food  and  transport)  during  peak\nseasons. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.811 is applied to unskilled labor in line with\nseasonal unemployment and underemployment in the SPAs.\n(iii) Subproject  Costs:  The  economic  costs  of  each  subproject  were  derived  by\nadjusting  the  financial  cost  of  forest  field  development  including\nreforestation/afforestation (excluding price escalations, taxes, and duties) by the\nopportunity cost of labor and the SCF. Added to these are the subproject\u2019s share of\nproject costs, relating to intermediate goods in component one (planning, boundary\ndemarcations, and awareness and extension) and sector capacity strengthening in\ncomponent three (civil works, vehicles, equipment, training, consulting services).\n(iv) Subproject Benefits: For all but one core subproject intervention only  directly\nquantifiable  benefits  have  been  included  in  the  economic  analysis.  The  direct\nbenefits are the value of incremental wood production and agricultural production\n(annual crops, fruit crops, and tea) generated under this project in the subprojects.\nTimber production has been calculated from the trees\u2019 mean annual increment\n(measured in cubic meters per hectare) and rotation age under specific silviculture\nregimes and agro-ecological conditions. Any stock standing stock at the end of the\nperiod of analysis is valued at its stumpage value and included as a residual value.\n                                                  \n1\nLoan 1716-SRI, Coastal Resources Management Project, for $40 million, approved on 7 December 1999 used the\nshadow wage rate of 0.8.", "Appendix 11, page 2\n69\nIndirect benefits are included with the enrichment of protection forests on the steep\nslopes in the central and upland region of Sri Lanka. These forests were established\nto protect soil from erosion but high stocking monoculture stands resulted in no\nunderstorey and often no ground litter. Such sites are at risk from erosion, and initial\nestimates for monoculture pines indicate as much as 27 tons/hectare (ha)/year (yr)\nof soil is likely being eroded. The sediment created has a high probability of being\ndelivered  into  one  of  two  important  dams  for  generating  hydroelectricity\u2014the\nVictoria or Ratambe dam.\n(v) Period of Analysis: The project period of analysis is set at 33 years to reflect a full\nrotation based on the project interventions occurring over the 7-year project period.\nB. Economic Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis\n2. Using the above assumptions on costs and benefits at the subproject level, economic\ninternal rates of return were calculated for each core subproject as the base case summarized in\nTable A11.2. Two sensitivity cases were also developed: (i) a reduction in benefit stream by 10\npercent, which is indicative of lower mean annual increments; and (ii) a 10 percent increase in\ncosts reflecting increased costs due to site factors and cost overruns. Details are in Table A11.3.\nTable A11.2: Economic Internal Rates of Returns/Results of Sensitivity Tests\nCore Subproject Base Costs Decrease of 10% Combination\n10% Increase in of\nin Benefits Costs 2 Adverse\nCases\nAnuradhapura 15 12 13 11\nBadulla/N. Eliya 13 12 13 12\nRatnapura 20 19 19 19\nTotal Core Subprojects 15 14 14 13\nC.  Financial Analysis\n3. A financial analysis was carried out to demonstrate the financial returns that could be\nrealized  from  investments  in  improving  the  present  management  and  utilization  of  natural\nresources in the core subprojects.  Four activities are analyzed, each with the private sector as the\nprimary beneficiary. First, cultivated land is converted into a diversified agroforestry plot.  Second,\ninvolving woodlot owners who have limited knowledge on silviculture or marketing of trees. Third,\nthe intensification of agricultural practice in encroached land based on lowland tea production.\nFourth,  the  establishment  of  private  sector  forest  concession  operations.  Remaining  field\ninterventions target Forest Department operations where the decision to invest is based on the\neconomic rate of return as opposed to the private profits, and therefore were not assessed within a\nfinancial framework.", "Appendix 11, page 3\n70\n1. Agroforestry Model\n4. This model (for 1 ha) is based on the planting of multipurpose trees (timber and fruit) in a\nlow density that enables continued annual cropping. Within the Sri Lankan context, the model\nreflects an extended version of the home garden. In the \u201cwithout\u201d project analysis, income is\nderived  from  swidden  farming2  systems,  that  is  converted  into  an  annual  land  rental  of\nSLRs17,500/ha/yr. The annual rental is used to reflect the foregone income from such land when it\nis converted from swidden farming. The output of the model is based on production of annual\ncrops  (chilis,  gram,  corn,  soya,  and  millet),  with  medium-term  income  from  jack  fruit  trees,\nmangoes, lime, tamarind, and margosa followed by longer term income from acacia poles and teak\nlogs.  The levels of financial rates of return vary marginally based on the proportion of family labor\nrelative to the total labor demand. A financial rate of return of 14-16 percent was derived under\ndiffering hired labor scenarios with the higher rate associated with higher family labor input (Table\nA11.4).\n2. Woodlot Model\n5. The  woodlot  model  is based  on the current community woodlot model  that  assumes 1\nha/individual in the community. Current land use is based on past tree planting programs where\ncommunity members were provided incentives to plant trees. Since then, there has been no follow\nup and many of the stands are currently of poor form and mixed species some of which have little\neconomic value.  There is also uncertainty about the ownership of such plots and the trees on\nthem.  The ownership will be clarified and reinforced through the issuance of long-term leases,\nalong with input to maximize the value of the existing stand through pole harvesting and thinning.\nAssistance will be provided in harvesting and silviculture training and the establishment of a\nsecond rotation.  The financial returns are estimated to be about 15 percent after incorporating the\nlikely market value of existing trees in the model (Table A11.5). The \u201cwithout\u201d project case is based\non delayed harvesting and no replanting.\n3. Buffer Zone Management\n6. This 1 ha model is used as an indicative buffer zone intensification intervention and is\nbased  on  the  actual  data  from  the  Tea  SmallHolder  Association  extension  program  for  tea\nintensification. The \u201cwithout\u201d project analysis is based on a continuation of the current yields and\ninputs. Under the \u201cwith\u201d project case, yields are increased in response to improved management\ninputs and the use of mulches and fertilizer. The costs of implementing the three-year extension\nprogram are excluded as there is currently no cost recovery for the extension program. The rates\nof return are estimated to be 14 percent using the conservative estimate of yield response that has\nbeen achieved to date in the program.\n4. Private Sector Concessions\n7. The private sector concessionaire model is based on forming private sector corporate entity\nto  own  a  1,200  ha  forest  concession.    Under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  project  scenario,  all  production  is\nconsidered to be incremental as there is no production in a \u201cwithout\u201d project scenario.
