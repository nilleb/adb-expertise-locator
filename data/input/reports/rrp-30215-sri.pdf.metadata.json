Poverty  and\nfood insecurity is increasing especially among people living near\ntraditional  forest  areas  or  plantations.  Consequently,  they  are\nin  forest\nincreasingly  encroaching  on  the  forest,  resulting \nconversion  and  degradation.    In  the  long  run,  impoverishment\nand    land  degradation  lead  to  food  deficits  that  necessitate\nfurther   extension   of   agriculture  to  the  adjacent   forestlands,\n\nClassification:\n\nEnvironment\nAssessment:\n\nRationale:\n\n\fiii\n\nintensifying  land-use  conflicts  and  tension  between  the  Forest\nDepartment and  the  local  communities.

A  total  of  about  50,000\nbeneficiary  households  will  benefit \nthe  Project.  The\nbeneficiaries  are  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  sections  of  rural\ncommunities  consisting  of \nlandless  people,  sharecroppers,\nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  and  ethnic  minorities.  Of  the\nhouseholds in the core subproject areas, 40-65 percent is below\nthe poverty line and will benefit directly from improved access for\nproductive  activities  in  forestlands,  where  they  will  have  greater\nsecurity  of  tenure,  and  from  employment  generated  by  the\nProject.  Direct  benefits  will  be  derived  from  the  sale  or  home\nconsumption    of  timber    products.  Other  important  benefits\ninclude  reduction  of  soil  erosion,    conservation  of  biodiversity,\nand  further  development  of  participatory  forest  management\nstrategies.  The  estimated  economic  internal    rates  of  return  for\nthe core subprojects range from 13 to 20 percent. The estimated\nfinancial internal rates of return of several reforestation activities\nrange from 13 to 16 percent.\n\n\f\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Democratic  Socialist  Republic of Sri  Lanka for  the  Forest  Resources  Management\nSector Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  sought  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) in 1997 to finance a project aimed at promoting sustainable forest resource management.\nThe preparation of the Project was carried out under ADB technical assistance (TA).1 Following\ncompletion of the TA, fact-finding was carried out in 1999 and ADB appraised the Project from\n8-23  March  2000.2  This  report  has  been  based  on  the  feasibility  study  and  the  mission\u2019s\ndiscussions  with  the  representatives  of  Government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs),  communities,  beneficiaries,  and  bilateral  and  multilateral  aid  agencies  in  Sri  Lanka.\nThe project design is summarized in the project framework in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nForest Sector in Sri Lanka\n\n1.\n\nSector Description\n\n3.\nSri Lanka\u2019s national forests cover about 28 percent of the country\u2019s 6.6 million hectares\n(ha) land area, with 1.65  million ha  under  natural forests.3  These forests  exhibit high  levels of\ndiversity  and  some  of  the  rarest  plant  species  in  the  world  are  found  in  them.  Dry-mixed\nevergreen forests are the most widespread forest type in the country, and are home to some of\nthe poorest segments of the country\u2019s population.  Moreover, Sri  Lanka\u2019s forests play  a  crucial\nrole in maintaining soil, water, and nutrient cycles that support and sustain agriculture and allied\nactivities.\n\n4.\nOver  the  last  century,  forests  have  been  converted  for  agriculture,  plantation  corps,\nshifting cultivation, and human settlements. Although commercial logging in the natural forests\nwas banned in early 1980s, population and development pressures have resulted in an annual\ndeforestation  rate  of  1.1  percent  during  1990-1995;  this  rate  is  the  second  highest  in  South\nAsia.4 Conflicting and unsound policies and undefined national forest boundaries have abetted\nthe land conversion, deforestation, and forest area fragmentation activities. The present forests\nare  in  blocks  ranging  from  less  than  20  to  several  hundred  hectares,  with  a  few  blocks\nmeasuring 10,000 ha or more. Several of the forests that are in urgent need of conservation are\nnot  surveyed  and  thus  are  not  legally  gazetted  (publicly  recorded)  and  demarcated,  thereby\nlimiting the effectiveness of efforts to conserve them. The fragmented and dispersed nature of\nthe  forest  area  has  overstretched  the  administrative  and  management  capacity  of  the  Forest\nDepartment (FD).\n\n                                               \n1 \n2\n\nTA 3047-SRI: Forest Resource Management Project, for $800,000, approved on 20 July 1998.\nThe Mission comprised Toshio  Kondo,  Sr.  Project  Economist/Mission Leader;  J.  H.  Mir, Forestry  Specialist;  R.\nO\u2019Sullivan, Counsel; I. Simbolon, Social Development Specialist; S.T. Qadri, Sr. Environment Specialist; and L.\nSaunders, Staff Consultant/Natural Resource Economist. J. Cooney, Resident Representative; S. Ranawana of\nSri Lanka Resident Mission, and H. Imamura, Programs Officer, assisted the Mission.\n\n3       Forests  that  have  remained  unmodified  in terms  of  species  composition  and  structure,  and  depend  on  natural\n\n4\n\nregeneration for their renewal.\nFor the same period, Nepal ranked first in deforestation rates in South Asia.\n\n\f2\n\n5.\nThe  administration  and  management  responsibilities  for  the  national  forest  estate  are\nprimarily shared by FD (1.06 million ha) and the Department of Wildlife Conservation (0.78 million\nha). Because many forestlands have been converted to other land uses, the traditional forest area\nboundaries have become obsolete. Hence, FD\u2019s administrative and managerial jurisdiction is not\nwell  defined  and  this  undermines  its  capacity  to  effectively  protect  and  manage  forests.  FD\u2019s\npreoccupation with enforcement of timber  transport regulations and  centralized  decision  making\nhas resulted in inadequate attention to improving the productivity of the forests. Consequently, the\nforests produce less than 1 cubic meter (m3) of wood per hectare per year. This is far less than\ntheir full potential of 3-4 m3 per year. Low forest production has resulted in increasing shortages of\nraw  materials  for  the  domestic  saw  milling  and  plywood  industries,  and  extraction  from\nnonsustainable sources.\n\n6.\nThe Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP), developed in 1995, identified that wood for the\ndomestic  saw  milling,  plywood,  and  manufacturing  industries  would  be  significantly  lacking\nwithin 10-15  years.  Current  industrial  wood  demand  is  estimated  at  2.1million  m3  of  which  26\npercent  is  imported.  The  plantation  estate  sector  contributes  30  percent,  home  gardens  32\npercent, and illegal logging from natural forests is estimated to account for 20-28 percent of the\ndomestic industrial  wood supply.  Industrial  plantations contribute  less than 10  percent  to  local\nwood  production,  but  supply  the  construction  and  furniture  manufacturing  sectors.  Present\ntrends  in  decreasing  forest  cover  and  wood  supply  clearly  indicate  present  domestic  sources\ncan not meet the demand.\n\n7.\nRaw material supply problems of the wood industry are exacerbated by the  monopolistic\nrole  of  the  State  Timber  Corporation  (STC),  and  perverse  policies  and  regulations  governing\ntransport  of  privately  grown  timber.  This  has  resulted  in  poorly  formed  market  channels  and\nlinkages. STC\u2019s de facto monopoly over harvesting, transporting, and marketing of logs from FD\nplantations discourages private sector involvement in forestry. STC\u2019s monopoly and inefficiencies\nalso  cause  high  production  costs  and  losses  of  wood  harvested.  Consequent  wood  shortages\ncontribute to overexploitation of the state forests.\n\n8.\nIn 1998, the forest sector  contributed about 2 percent of gross domestic product  (GDP),\nand  primary  and  secondary  wood  industries  employed  about  60,000  people.  However,  the\ncontribution of the forest sector to national and local economies is not fully captured by the current\neconomic and financial accounting systems. For example, nonwood forest products have a role in\nthe rural economy. About 14 million rural people, or about 80 percent of the national population,\ndepend on forests to supply a wide range of such products. In the Knuckles region alone, on an\naverage,  about  16  percent  of  the  total  family  income  is  derived  from  such  products.  In  some\nplaces,  cultivation  of  cardamom  in  the  forests  provides  about  26  percent  of  the  total  family\nincome.  The  undervaluation  of  financial  returns  from  the  sector  causes  policy  and  decision-\nmakers  to  underestimate  its  revenue  mobilization  capacity.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  forest  sector  has  not\nreceived the investment support commensurate with its development challenges.\n\n9.\nIn  response  to  increased  forestland  conversion  and  increasing  wood  product  demand,\nSri  Lanka  initiated  in  1870s  a  plantation  program  that  was  intensified  in  the  1950s.  To  date,\n135,000  hectares  of  plantations5  have  been  established  to  serve  environmental  and\ndevelopmental  objectives.  Because  of  declining  areas  of  natural  forests,  the  importance  of\ncommercial  plantations  has  increased.  However,  the  plantations  often  suffer  from  insufficient\nsilvicultural management, resulting in suboptimal growth. Thus, the plantations realize less than\n30  percent  of  their  potential  because  of  delays  in  harvesting  caused  by  STC\u2019s  monopoly.\nConsequently, STC is often unable to meet harvesting targets, and substantial wood production\nand revenue are lost.\n\n                                               \n5 \n\nThe most common plantation species are teak, eucalyptus, pine, and mahogany.\n\n\f2.\n\nRural Poverty in Sri Lanka\n\n3\n\n 10.\nAlthough Sri Lanka has strong social indicators compared with other countries in South\nAsia,  its  incidence  of  poverty  is  high,  with  21  percent  of  the  total  18.8  million  population  still\nliving  in  poverty.  Despite  the  high  priority  that  the  Government  has  assigned  to  poverty\nreduction in recent years, the number of poor people has not declined significantly. According to\nthe preliminary findings of the Government\u2019s, ongoing poverty study,6 poverty is predominantly a\nrural phenomenon in Sri Lanka, with over 85 percent of the poor in rural areas. Most of the poor\nare  concentrated  in  the  provinces  where  agricultural  growth  has  been  slow  due  to  adverse\nagroecological conditions and insufficient infrastructure such as roads and markets. Malnutrition\nis widespread especially among children and mothers. Sri Lanka\u2019s food balance sheets for 1993\nand  1994  show  low  per  capita  availability  of  calories,  which  is  just  above  the  recommended\nminimum of 2,100 calories per day.\n \nDespite the introduction of the welfare-driven Samurdhi social safety net programs,7 Sri\n 11.\nLanka does not  have  a  specific poverty  policy.  The  Government  began  its  Poverty  Reduction\nStudy in 1998, with a view to developing a  comprehensive poverty framework for  the  country.\nThe Government is coordinating Sri Lanka\u2019s first integrated survey of poverty, which will provide\nvaluable  additional  information  about  the  household,  social,  and  economic  characteristics  of\npoverty. The Government\u2019s framework for poverty reduction under the study advocates a three-\npronged strategy to achieve poverty reduction: (i) improving economic and social opportunities\nfor the poor, and broadening the range of people who benefit from growth; (ii) providing security\nto  people  unable  to  participate  in  mainstream  economic  activities  and  protecting  excluded,\nmarginalized,  and  vulnerable groups;  and  (iii)  empowering  people  to  have  a  voice  in  decision\nmaking and development.\n\n12.\nThe  contributing  causes  of  poverty  in  the  rural  area  are  (i)  lack  of  remunerative\neconomic activities, associated with high levels of unemployment; and (ii) landlessness and lack\nof secure land and tree tenure. The dry zone areas have the highest incidence of poverty in the\ncountry. Near forest reserves in the dry zone, 38 percent of the population is below the poverty\nline and 57 percent is just above it.8 Most of the households near forest reserves, regardless of\nincome,  are  on  encroached  lands.  Where  land  is  still  available,  most  households  engage  in\nshifting  cultivation  on  state  land  that  can  supply  20  percent  of  the  household  income  and\nprovide  subsistence  grain  and  vegetables.  Communities  near  forest  reserves  in  the  dry  zone\nareas also depend on forest resources for self-employment activities. The condition in  the  wet\nzone  areas  is  slightly  better.  Socioeconomic  surveys  show  that  households  near  forest\nperipheries  receive  45-65  percent  of  their  income  from  tea.  Although  50  percent  of  the\nhouseholds earn SLRs3,000-8,000 ($41-$109) per month in the wet zone areas, in some areas\n13  percent  of  households  fall  below  the  poverty  line.  While  income  levels  are  definitely\ncorrelated to landholding size, all income groups are found to have encroached  on forestland,\nand encroached upon lands account for 26 percent of total landholdings. Home gardens, which\nare  usually  managed  by  women  on  encroached  lands,  are  an  important  source  of  multiple\nproducts, from fruit to minor export crops to wood.\n\n                                               \n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank support the ongoing poverty study.\nSince its introduction in 1994, the Samurdhi Program has become the Government\u2019s principal poverty alleviation\nand social safety net program. In 1998 the program budget amounted to 4 percent of government expenditure.\nThe welfare transfer component, accounting for 85 percent of program budget, provides needy households with\nin- kind transfers using a system of food stamps. There are six categories of eligible households, with the highest\nlevels of transfers being SLRs1,000 per month for those categorized as ultra poor, and SLRs500 per month for\nthose categorized as poor.\nThe poverty line is SLRs3,540 ($48) per household per month.\n\n\f4\n\n13.\nIn  rural  areas  the  poor  are  partly  the  cause,  but  are  also  the  victims,  of  the  forest\ndegradation  problem.  The  extent  and  patterns  of  dependence  on  the  forest  vary  among\ncommunities,  depending  on  the  nature,  magnitude,  and  accessibility  of  forest  resources.\nHowever, the primary dependence of certain forest communities, especially in the dry zone, on\na  rapidly  depleting  resource  is  one  of  the  major  causes  of  deprivation.  Poverty  among  the\ncommunities  near  forest  reserves  has  increased  pressure  on  forest  resources  through\nincreased land encroachments, degradation, and deforestation. On the other hand, insecurity of\nland rights for long-term use or lease arrangements over the encroached land has discouraged\nmany forest  communities from  making a  long-term  investment  in  the  land.  The  inability  of  the\nresource base to regenerate itself because of the heavy pressure of exploitation and uncertainty\nof  land  rights  sets  up  a  resource  depletion-poverty  cycle,  which  reinforces  the  poverty-\nenvironment degradation nexus.\n\nReducing poverty by meeting the legitimate needs of poor people dependent on forests\n14.\nby  providing  income-earning  opportunities,  household  energy,  and  fodder  for  cattle  can  break\nthis  vicious  cycle.  In  this  context,  security  of  tenure  over  forestland  is  a  prerequisite  for  local\ncommunities to participate in activities to ensure they share in the output.\n\nNGOs9  in  Sri  Lanka  also  play  an  important  role  in  poverty  reduction.  They  help\n15.\nimplement afforestation and community development programs. Given their experience in rural\nself-employment programs and the development of microenterprises, their services can be used\nin  poverty  reduction programs  to  enhance  community  participation  through  social  mobilization\nand  training  of  poor  rural  communities.  Moreover,  NGOs  can  facilitate  the  formation  of\ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs)  dedicated  to  poverty  reduction  and  forest  resource\nmanagement, and provide critical support to nascent CBOs of the rural poor, until they become\nself-reliant.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies, Plans, and Programs\n\n1.\n\nStrategic Framework, Policies, and Legislation\n\n16.\nThe  Government  has  recognized  that  to  solve  the  problem  of  the  diminishing  forest\nresource base and the fragmented nature of the forest estate, the cooperation and participation\nof  all  stakeholders  is  required  for  instituting  sustainable  forest  management.  Stakeholder\nparticipation, especially of the local communities is essential for (i) establishing, delineating, and\nenforcing forest area boundaries and thereby forest protection; (ii) increasing  wood production\noutside  the  state  forests  through  social  forestry  programs,  thereby  increasing  the  production\nbase  and  easing  the  pressure  on  natural  forests;  and  (iii)  ensuring  conservation  of  protected\nareas. This shift from the traditional protectionist approach to a participatory one is essential to\nensure  that  the  management  systems  respond  to  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  the  local\ncommunities, and reduce poverty by generating employment and income. To establish genuine\nparticipatory forest  management,  stakeholder  participation  has  to  be  secured  for  the  Project\u2019s\nfull  planning  and  implementation  cycle.  This  has  to  be  complemented  with  secure  tenurial\narrangements for sharing the benefits from the assets created. However, the implementation of\nthis  strategy  requires  (i)  transparency  with  regards  to  technical,  financial,  and  administrative\naspects  of  development  interventions;  (ii)  full  accountability  of  all  actions  involved  in\nimplementing development activities; and (iii) institution of an independent monitoring system.\n\n                                               \n 9\n\nSST: REG 99027: Special Evaluation Study of the Role of Nongovernment Organizations and Community-Based\nOrganizations in Asian Development Bank. The study reveals that NGO/CBO involvement enhances consultative\nand participatory project development, which is positively linked to project quality. Evidence exists that the use of\nNGOs/CBOs  improves  the  effectiveness  of  projects  where  beneficiary  consultation  and  participation  are\nimportant.\n\n\f5\n\nThe  adoption  of  the  new  National  Forest  Policy  (NFP)10  in  1995  reflects  government\n17.\ncommitment to policy and institutional reforms to institute participatory forest management. The\nforest policy acknowledges concern for safeguarding the remaining natural forests for posterity.\nIt  emphasizes  the  importance  of  retaining  the  present  natural  forest  cover  and  increasing  the\noverall  tree  cover,  and  the  need  for  an  effective  forest  protected  area  system  to  conserve\nbiodiversity,  soil,  and  water  resources.  The  production  forests,  including  plantations  under\nsustainable  forest  management,  are  to  provide  for  the  growing  demand  for  forest  products.\nFurthermore,  the  NFP  recognizes  the  crucial  role  to  be  played  by  home  gardens  and\nnonforestlands  through  the  use  of  social  forestry  and  agroforestry  technologies.  The  NFP\nenvisages  broadening  the  institutional  framework  for  forest  management  with  clearly  defined\nroles  and  responsibilities  for  the  forest  resource  development  partners.  The  public  sector,\nfarmers, local communities, NGOs, and small- and medium-scale commercial entrepreneurs all\nhave  a  role  in  activities  such  as  protecting  the  forests;  growing  trees  to  meet  the  wood  and\nbioenergy  requirements;  supplying  raw  material  for  wood-based  industries;  and  harvesting,\ntransporting, processing, and marketing various forest products.\n\nThe  FSMP  conforms  to  the  spirit  of  the  NFP  by  providing  a  sector  development\n18.\nframework  for  1995-2020.  The  FSMP  takes  into  account  lessons  learned  from  various\ndevelopment  programs,  and  emphasizes a  participatory  approach  to  address  issues  faced  by\nthe  forest  sector.  The  lessons  include    (i)  ensuring  that  rural  communities  are  empowered  to\nmanage multiple-use forests for their  own  benefit;  and  (ii)  in case  of natural forests,  striking a\nbetter  balance  between  the  production  and  protection  functions  by  ensuring  participatory\nsustainable  forest  management  is  practiced  by  all  willing  and  capable  stakeholders.  The\nreorientation  accomplished  through  the  NFP  led  FD  to  develop \nthe  1997  Five-Year\nImplementation  Program  (FYIP).  The  FYIP  prescribes  a  balance  between  conservation  and\nsustainable forest management supported by public and private sector smallholder participation\nin commercial forestry, and provided a sectoral implementation framework of the FSMP.\n\nDuring the last three years, planned investment for implementation of the FYIP has been\n19.\ndelayed  by  limited  public  sector  financial  resources  and  delays  in  the  establishment  of\nappropriate legislation and institutional reform to support the policy environment. The FYIP has\nbeen  updated  and  renamed  the  Seven-Year  Implementation  Plan  (SYIP).  It  includes  a\ndevelopment  plan  to  facilitate  investments  in  the  sector  by  ADB  and  other  interested  funding\nsources.  The  SYIP  stresses  the  need  to  demarcate  zone  forestlands  as  a  prerequisite  to\nprograms dealing with forest resources management, biodiversity conservation, conservation of\nsoil  and  water  resources,  forest  plantations,  social  and  agroforestry  development,  and  wood-\nbased industries. The FSMP and SYIP also highlight the need for private sector participation. In\nresponse to ADB\u2019s concerns, policies have been developed that will facilitate commercialization\nof selected State operations, introduce a proper permit system for utilizing the forest resources,\nreduce  and  refine  State  control,  and  confirm  proper  tenure  arrangements.  Implementing\nlegislation  and  institutional  reforms  (including  restructuring  and  capacity  building  of  FD)  have\nbeen developed and are currently in the process of being formalized. The SYIP also includes (i)\naccelerating  the  development  and  implementation  of  forest  management  plans,  (ii)  creating\nsecure  conditions  for  long-term  investments  by  private  firms  in  commercial  forestry;  and  (iii)\nderegulating  the  timber  trade.  The  SYIP,  which  commences  in  the  year  2000,  provides  an\nappropriate framework for investment.\n\n20. While the Forest Ordinance of 1907 provides the legal framework for the forest sector, it\nis not fully responsive to participatory objectives of the NFP. Thirteen amendments since 1907\n                                               \n10  The  basic  principle  of  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  forestry  is  to  ensure  the  balance  of  protection  and  production\nthrough the participation of stakeholders, according to Asian Development Bank. 1995.  ADB Policy on Forestry,\nManila.\n\n\f6\n\nhave  updated  the  framework  but  most  of  these  emphasize  protectionist  and  regulatory\napproaches  to  forest  sector  development.  In  recognition  of  the  imperative  to  make  the\nlegislation fully responsive and aligned with the letter and spirit of the NFP, the Government is\nconsidering promulgating new legislation or amending the ordinance. The proposed  legislation\nis  being  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and  Environment  (MFE)  for  submission  to  the\nCabinet prior to its consideration by Parliament.\n\n2.\n\nInstitutional Framework and Forestry Sector Development\n\nMFE  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  development  of  forestry  policies,  coordination  of\n21.\nsector development programs, preparation of overall policy guidance on the forestry sector, and\nsupervision of key sector institutions, including FD and STC. Other  government agencies also\naffect the forestry sector activities. The Department of Wildlife Conservation11 administers over\n12  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  land  as  protected  areas.  FD  and  Department  of  Wildlife\nConservation share common concerns with biodiversity and soil conservation.\n\nSTC12 is responsible for the extraction of timber from state forests and plantations, and\n22.\nsale of logs and of sawn wood and furniture produced in its plants. Its jurisdiction was extended\nin  1982  to  the  import  of  timber,  afforestation  works  and  forest  management,  and  agricultural\nproduction.\n\n23.\nAs  enunciated  in  the  NFP,  the  Government  stresses  that  institutional  reforms  are\nimportant  to  allow  the  implementation  of  integrated  forest  resources  management  plans\n(IFRMPs)  and  institutionalize  in  MFE  sound  forest  resources  management  practices  and\nprocedures.  The  Government  also  recognizes  that  active  participation  of  all  stakeholders\nincluding NGOs and CBOs is required to successfully implement the IFRMPs. Activities of many\nNGOs  and  CBOs  are  associated  with  forests.  However,  most  such  organizations  stress\nenvironmental  conservation  rather  than  sustained  yield  forest  management.  While  NGOs  are\nlarge organizations  with  national  level  presence  and  local-level  branches,  CBOs  are  localized\npeoples'  organizations  that  espouse  particular  causes.  Some  of  them  undertake  reforestation\nwhile others are associated with soil and water conservation and rural development. Given the\nmandate for their involvement in forestry under the NFP, NGOs and CBOs are likely to play an\nimportant role in managing and protecting forest resources.\n\n24.\nNGOs  in  Sri  Lanka  have  played  an  important  role  in  poverty  reduction.  They  have\nhelped implement afforestation and community development programs. Given their experience\nin rural areas in support of self-employment programs and the development of microenterprises,\ntheir services can be utilized in poverty reduction programs to enhance community participation\nthrough  social  mobilization  and  training  of  poor  rural  communities.  Moreover,  NGOs  can\nfacilitate the formation of CBOs dedicated to poverty reduction and environmental management,\nand provide critical support to nascent CBOs of the rural poor until they become self-reliant.\n\n25.\nFD must realign itself and gear itself to play the changing role associated especially with\nthe  (i)  emphasis  on  peoples\u2019  participation  in  the  protection,  conservation,  development,  and\nmanagement of natural forests and plantations; (ii) strengthening of NGOs and CBOs to act as\npartners  in  facilitating  the  implementation  of  the  NFP;  and  (iii)  development  of  a  closer\nrelationship between the forest dependent communities and FD staff, as the two are equal and\nimportant  parts  of  the  forest  resources  development  process.  In  recognition  of  this  change  in\nperspective  from  the  traditional  policing  function,  FD  has  committed  to  realign  itself  and\n\n                                               \n11  Under the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs.\n12  A Government corporation established through provisions of the 1957 Industrial Corporation Act, under the MFE\n\npurview in 1968.\n\n\f7\n\ndecentralize its administration, devolve authority to field-based units, and bring its staff closer to\nthe forests and away from the policing functions.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nSince  1975,  the  forest  sector  of  Sri  Lanka  has  received  an  estimated  $100  million  of\n26.\nbilateral and multilateral assistance. Major sources of assistance have included ADB, the World\nBank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and bilateral aid agencies such as\nthe  United States  Agency for  International  Development  (USAID);  the  Overseas  Development\nAdministration  (ODA),  now  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  United\nKingdom  (UK);  the  Finnish  International  Development  Agency  (FINNIDA);  and  the  Australian\nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID).  The  focus  of  external  assistance  was\nconventional  reforestation  in  1980s,  which  gradually  shifted  in  the  1990s  to  sustainable\nmanagement  of  forest  resources  through  participatory  approaches,  while  strengthening\ninstitutional capacities of FD.\n\nADB's  assistance  began  in  1982  with  the  Community  Forestry  Project.13  The  project,\n27.\nwhich was successfully completed in 1991, aimed at addressing the problem of declining forest\nresources by conventional reforestation in a block plantation program and a small social forestry\ncomponent  involving  tree  cultivation  by  rural  communities.  8,100  ha  of  block  plantations  and\n1,200 ha of farmers' woodlots were established. This was followed by the ongoing Participatory\nForestry  Project.14  This  project  increased  production  of  forest  and  tree  products,  enhanced\nemployment opportunities and income, and rehabilitated environmentally degraded areas in the\ncountry  through  beneficiaries\u2019  participation. AusAID  cofinanced  the  project  in  the  form  of  food\naid paid to farmers as compensation for time spent in tree planting and maintenance activities.\nADB\u2019s Upper Watershed Management Project15 addresses the forest and land degradation and\npoverty  in  the  upper  watersheds  by  increasing  forest  cover  in  critical  watersheds  through\nintegrated and participatory approaches, with the added objective of increasing productivity and\nsmall-scale farmers\u2019 income by promoting conservation-oriented farming systems.\n\n28.\nExternal  assistance  (Appendix  2)  has  also  played  an  important  role  in  the  sector,\nparticularly in the development of the Forestry Master Plan in 1983, funded by the World Bank\nand FINNIDA. In 1991, the World Bank, FINNIDA, DFID, and UNDP provided assistance to the\nForestry  Sector  Development  Project  to  help  the  Government  improve  forestry  sector\nperformance  in  line  with  Sri  Lanka's  economic,  social,  and  environmental  requirements  by\ndeveloping and implementing a five-year portion of the FSMP.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n29.\nThe  forest  sector  findings  of  the  Country  Synthesis  of  Postevaluation  Findings  in  Sri\nLanka  (1997),16  lessons  learned  from  the  forestry  projects  funded  by  ADB,  and  other  aid\nagencies in Sri Lanka point to a number of issues that need to be addressed in the forest sector\nincluding reforms in policy, legislation, and institutional matters. The issues include (i) sustained\nand full participation of the local communities and their access to secure land and tree tenure,\nlands;\n(ii)  deregulation  of  harvesting  and \n(ii) reorientation  and  redeployment  of  the  FD  staff  to  focus  on  practicing  sound  forest\nmanagement  as  opposed  to  policing;  (iii)  enhancement  of  FD\u2019s  institutional  capacity  and\n\ntimber  grown  on  private \n\ntransportation  of \n\n                                               \n13  Loan  568-SRI:  Community Forestry Project,  for  $10  million,  approved  on  25  March  1982,  and  closed  on  30\n\nSeptember 1992.\n\n14  Loan 1183-SRI: Participatory Forestry Project, for $10.5 million, approved on 5 November 1992.\n15  Loan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project, for $16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.\n16   Postevaluation  Office.

The lessons learned from the forestry related projects in\nSri Lanka and other countries are detailed in Appendix 3. Experience in the region indicates that\nparticipatory  and  community-based  national  resources  management  approaches  are  more\neffective  than  other  methods  in  creating  positive  ecological  and  social  impacts.  Such  impacts\ninclude  improved  soil  conservation,  stabilization  of  hydrological  systems,  and  creation  of  wind\nshelters.\n\nE.\n\nADB's Sectoral Strategy\n\nADB's Country Operational Strategy for Sri Lanka (1998)17 recommends that sustainable\n30.\nnatural resources management should be one of the key areas for ADB\u2019s involvement to reduce\npoverty and  ensure  long-term  sustainability  of  economic  growth.  Criteria that  will  guide  ADB's\ninterventions include (i) achieving a balance between the economic and ecological functions of\nthe  environment,  (ii)  addressing poverty-related  causes of environmental  degradation, and  (iii)\npreventing  and  minimizing  economic  damage  to  existing  environmental  infrastructure.  Forest\nand biodiversity conservation and management are focal areas for ADB\u2019s assistance, together\nwith  sustainable  development  and  management  of  coastal  resources  and  integrated  water\nresource management.\n\n31.\nADB's policy on forestry encompasses three basic principles: protection, production, and\nparticipation.  Based  on  these  principles,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  stresses  activities  that  (i)  enhance\nprotective  functions  of  forests  with  respect  to  soil,  water,  and  biodiversity;  (ii)  carry  out  cost\neffective  and  sustainable  harvesting  of  natural  and  plantation  forests;  and  (iii)  promote\ninvolvement  of  affected  communities  in  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  forestry\ndevelopment activities. Focus on interventions to reduce poverty as ADB\u2019s overarching goal has\nbeen highlighted in natural resources management projects and enhanced through employment\nof  participatory  approaches.  Based  on  these  considerations,  the  Project  has  been  designed\nprimarily to improve livelihoods of poor rural people.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n32.\nThe  Government  has  formulated  and  adopted  the  NFP  and  gained  experience  from\nimplementing ADB-assisted forestry projects. The Government and ADB agrees that policy and\ninstitutional  reforms  with  an  enabling  legislative  framework  are  necessary  to  facilitate\nimplementation of the NFP. Priority actions in this context include (i) the deregulation of permits\nfor transport of timber grown by the private sector; (ii) private sector (both formal and informal)\nparticipation in harvesting, establishment, and management of state-owned plantations; (iii) the\ngranting  of  25  year  leases  or  management  rights  to  forestlands,  with  secure  tenure\narrangements  for  participating  stakeholders,  and  delegation  of  power  to  the  conservator  of\nforests  (CF)  to  issue  such  leases;  (iv)  the  reorganization  of  FD  to  establish  and  practice\nsustainable  forest  management;  and  (v)  minimizing  of  the  intersectoral  incursions  that\nundermine the long-term sustainability of the national forests. For example, the promotion of tea\ngrowing  under  the  small-scale  tea  farmers  program  has  increased  pressure  on  the  national\nforests. The Government recognizes the need for comprehensive land-use  planning  and  inter-\nsectoral policy coordination to minimize the negative impact of such externalities, and sees the\nProject as a means of addressing these issues.\n\n                                               \n17      STS: SRI: 98017: Country Operation Strategy Study, Sri Lanka, November 1998.\n\n\f1. \n\nLegislative Reforms\n\n9\n\n33.\nThe Government concurs that current legislation and regulations hamper integrated and\nsustainable  development  of  the  sector.  Consequently,  the  Government  has  demonstrated  its\nwillingness to revise the forest legislation and regulations to make them responsive to the NFP.\nThe Government has  assured  ADB  that  it  is committed to  reforms  in  legislation to facilitate  (i)\npeople-oriented forestry and plantation development, and (ii) participation of the private sector.\nThe  reforms are needed  to  enhance  productivity  and  sustain  forestry  sector  development.  To\nthat  end,  the  Government  has  also  assured  ADB  that  a  new  bill  on  forest  legislation  and\nregulations  will  be  developed  to  facilitate  deregulation  of  timber  and  wood  harvesting  and\ntransport.\n\n34.\nThe Government stresses the importance of the role of local communities in sustainable\nforest  resources  management  and  the  need  for  their  access  and  participation.  Increasing\npoverty  in  rural areas, especially  of  the  communities  near  the  natural  forests  and  plantations,\nhas  contributed  to  continued  degradation,  deforestation,  and  encroachment.  The  Government\nhas  agreed  to  issue  appropriate  instructions  to  guarantee  private  sector  and  local  community\nparticipation in forest resources management. This will include (i) removing disincentives to the\nprivate sector for growing trees, such as the requirement of transport permits for privately grown\ntimber;  and  (ii)  opening  the  harvesting  and  management  of  state-owned  plantations  through\ncompetitive  bidding.  The  Government  recognizes  that  for  the  forest  sector  to  achieve  its  full\neconomic  potential,  policies  that  result  in  inefficient  use  of  forest  resources  and  commercial\nplantations  must  be  reformed.  The Government has  agreed to phase  out  STC\u2019s  monopoly  on\nharvesting timber from the national forests over a period of three years.\n\n35.\nIn this context, the Government has agreed to implement the following: (i) during 2001,\n2002,  and  2003,  STC  will  have  guaranteed  access  to  state  forest  plantations  with  annual\nharvesting rights over 1,200 ha (the level earmarked for 2000), provided the area harvested by\nSTC during 2001, equals or exceeds the 1,200 ha allocation. If STC is unable to meet the 2001\nharvesting target, the annual allocation  for 2002 and 2003 will be limited to the maximum area\nthat STC harvested during 2001;  (ii) for the remaining area (not less than 600 ha in 2002 and\n2003) that is available for harvesting under the existing management plans or the IFRMPs, free\nand  open  competitive  bidding  is  to  be  available  to  STC  and  the  private  sector  equally.  The\nbidding  will be  conducted  in  accordance  with  open and  competitive  procedures  that are  to  be\nintroduced  and  that  (a)  incorporate  appropriate  safeguards  (such  as  prequalification  of\nleaseholders,  guarantees,  and  performance  bonds),  (b)  ensure  adherence  to  sound  forestry\noperational  practices,  (reflecting  the  Forestry  Code  of  Practice  approved  by  the  Food  and\nAgriculture  Organization),  and  (c)  create  equal  opportunities  for  public  and  private  sector\nparticipation; and (iii) at the end of year 2003, STC\u2019s special allocation of harvesting rights will\nbe  reviewed  by  an  independent  committee  comprising  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  experts\nselected in consultation with ADB with the objective of enhancing private sector participation.\n\n36.\nIn  concert  with  a  thorough  public  awareness  campaign,  the  Government  agreed  to\nderegulate  the  harvesting  and  transport  of  timber  species  grown  privately,  for  eight  rare  and\nvaluable species. The deregulation, to be conducted nationwide, will occur in a phased manner\ncovering 49 species by the end of 2001, 18 more species by the end of 2002, and 60 more by\nthe  end  of  2003.  The  deregulation  will  be  monitored  annually  and  will  eliminate  excess  stock\nexaminations  in  all  private  wood  enterprises  by  end  of  2001.  By  the  end  of  2003,  the\nGovernment will review the deregulation of jak18 timber harvesting and transport.\n\n                                               \n18\n\nJack Fruit tree.\n\n\f2. \n\nReforms in Long-term Land Use/Lease Arrangements\n\n10\n\n37.\nThe  Government  has  confirmed  that  long-term  land-use  and  lease  arrangements  are\nessential  for  committed  management  by  participating  stakeholders  and  has  agreed  that  long-\nterm leases and management rights will be given to all farmers participating in agroforestry and\nwoodlot programs and that leases will be cosigned by spouses, if both are living. The long-term\nland-use/lease  arrangement  (25  years)  with  cost-benefit  sharing  arrangements  has  been\nimplemented. The Government agreed that this practice would be improved through delegating\nforestland-leasing powers to the CF in order to minimize administrative delays and transaction\ncosts  to  potential  beneficiaries,  and  to  facilitate  instituting  participatory  sustainable  forest\nmanagement.  Until  the  delegation  is  formalized,  the  CF  will  keep  the  Land  Commissioner\ninformed  of  lease  proposals,  and  the  Government  agreed  that  the  Land  Commissioner  will\nfacilitate the leasing process with the provision of renewal for another 25 years, if the lessee has\nperformed adequately. Rules and procedures for private sector leasehold management of state\nforest plantations, in line with the NFP, will also be adopted and formalized.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Reforms\n\n38.\nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  reform  FD.  The  MFE,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  has\nproposed  an  institutional  structure  that  is  to  be  approved  by  the  Government.  The  structure\nincludes the following, which have been accomplished: (i) the creation of four new positions to\nenhance the implementation of IFRMPs,  (ii)  the  decentralization  and  devolution of appropriate\nadministration  and  management  authority  to  the  CF  and  regional  forest  officers  by  loan\nnegotiations,  to  facilitate  effective  implementation  of  the  Project,  and  (iii)  the  constitution  of  a\nnational  project  implementation  unit and  the  assignment  of  staff  to  the  restructured  FD  at  the\nnational, regional,  and district officers level. The reorganized FD is establishing an ecosystem-\nand  area-based \nthe  primary\nresponsibility  of  FD  staff  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  field-level  forest  management  and\nthe\ndevelopment  practices.  This  will  also  require  rationalization  and  realignment  of \nadministrative  and  forest  management  unit  boundaries  along  with  a  corresponding  staff\nredeployment program. In addition, organizational  procedures for  improved  work  planning  and\nfor management information systems are to be implemented throughout FD.\n\nforest  resources  management  system  where \n\nintegrated \n\nThe details of the agreements reached with the Government in accordance with a time-\n\n39.\nbound action plan consequent to policy dialogue are given in Appendix 4.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nPoverty among forest  dependent  communities  is  closely  linked  with deforestation,  land\n40.\ndegradation,  and  land  and  tree  tenure  insecurities.  Causes  of  poverty  in  forest-dependent\ncommunities in the rural  areas  include unclear forest boundaries  leading  to  insecure  land  and\ntree tenure,  inadequate technical  and  extension  capacity  of  the  FD,  and  government  decision\nmakers\u2019  lack  of  awareness  about  the  value  of  the  forests  to  livelihood  improvement  and\neconomic development. Because people do not have secure land and tree tenures, they do not\nmake  long-term  investments  in  forest  and  tree  growing,  and  limit  their  participation  in  the\nmanagement of forest resources that affect their life. The Project will help reduce deforestation\nand  degradation  of  lands  and  soils  on  which  these  communities  depend  for  subsistence.\nMoreover,  strengthening  of  FD\u2019s  extension  and  technical  capacities,  in  conjunction  with\nboundary demarcation and integrated forest management, will increase their income generating\nopportunities.  The  Project\u2019s  participatory  approach  will  ensure  participation  of \nforest\ncommunities,  NGOs,  and  CBOs.  This  will  accelerate  the  participatory  forest  resource\n\n\f11\n\ndevelopment and environmental awareness in which local communities see themselves as the\nbeneficiaries of the process. Close consultation and participation of local communities in forest\ndemarcation  and  delineation, \nlease\narrangements,  will  help  create  security  of  tenure  for  the  poor  households  and  in  turn,  will\nencourage a long-term productive investment.\n\ntogether  with \n\nthe  reform \n\nforestland \n\nlong-term \n\nin \n\n41.\nFD\u2019s  current  organizational  structure  and  decision-making  procedures  emphasize\nadministration  and  policing,  which  limits  community  participation  in  forest  management.  FD\u2019s\npreoccupation with administering a dispersed and undemarcated estate on its own has resulted\nin piecemeal efforts being made to improve forest management and productivity. Furthermore,\nthe  STC  monopoly  on  timber  harvesting,  and  timber  transport  regulations,  have  discouraged\nprivate sector and local communities from becoming full  partners  in  increasing production and\nimproving the management of the forest estate.\n\n42.\n  The  FSMP  lays  out  the  long-term  sector  development  priorities  and  investment\nstrategies.  This  is  complemented  by  the  new  NFP,  which  emphasizes  participatory  forest\nmanagement principles and is in line with ADB\u2019s forest sector policy. However, to implement the\nsector  approach  and \nforest  management,\ncomprehensive  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  are  required  and  must  be\ncomplemented by clear delineation and demarcation of the national forest areas.\n\ninstitutionalize  participatory  sustainable \n\nto \n\n43.\nMoreover, to reduce poverty among the forest dependent communities, investments will\nbe needed to provide them with secure land and tree tenure. This effort can be strengthened by\ndelineating  and  demarcating  of  permanent  forest  estate,  implementing  institutional  reforms  to\nimprove governance and performance of the forest sector by enhancing community and private\nsector participation, and upgrading FD\u2019s operational  and  technological  capacities for  improved\nforest protection and production.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n44.\nThe overall goal of the Project is to increase the value and sustainability of Sri Lanka\u2019s\nforests. The goal is to be achieved by creating a policy and governance framework that enables\nparticipation  of  local  communities  and  the  private  sector  in  forest  resource  development  and\nmanagement.  The  objectives  of  the  proposed  Project  are  to  (i)  establish  and  implement\nparticipatory sustainable forest management of demarcated permanent forests, to increase their\nprotection and  production; and  (ii)  enhance access  of  the  local  communities  (in  particular,  the\neconomically disadvantaged people) to gainful employment and  human  resource  development\nopportunities, leading to poverty reduction.\n\n45.\nThe  Project  will  cover  17  of  the  19  existing  territorial  forest  divisions.  If  the  security\nsituation  improves,  the  Project  will  be  extended  to  cover  the  remaining  two  divisions.  The\nProject will support the first part of FSMP, to be implemented during seven years. The Project\nwill include activities aimed at implementing the NFP. Consistent with a sector approach and the\nNFP,  the  Project  will  help  the  Government  improve  forest  sector  governance  by  establishing\nlegal and functional boundaries of the forest areas. This  will  allow  improved  management  and\nprotection. At the same time, timber transport and trade will be deregulated; the STC monopoly\non  harvesting  timber  on  state  forestlands  will  be  phased  out;  and  local  communities  and  the\nprivate  sector  will  be  involved  in  rehabilitation,  regeneration,  and  management  of  state\nforestlands and plantations.\n\n46.\nThe Project will be implemented in about 10 subproject areas (SPAs), each covering up\nto  three  forestry  divisions.  A  comprehensive  study  was  successfully  concluded  in  three  core-\nSPAs  (Anuradhapura,  Badulla  and  Nuwara  Eliya,  and  Ratnapura)  during  the  TA  identified\n\n\f12\n\nintervention  packages  for  implementation  under  the  Project.  These  interventions  are  equally\napplicable  to  the  additional  seven  SPAs  that  have  been  selected.  However,  the  work  and  its\nphasing will be tailored to specific needs and requirements of each SPA. Most SPAs conform to\nthe  existing  forest  division  boundaries,  although  divisions  with  similar  agroecological  features\nhave been combined to form a single SPA to ensure consistency with an integrated ecosystem\nmanagement approach. The other criteria for the constitution and selection of the SPAs include\n(i)  the  interventions  within  each  subproject  must  be  compatible  with  the  overall  project\nobjectives  and  interventions  in  the  core  SPAs;  (ii)  beneficiary  communities  must  have\nestablished their willingness and ability to participate; (iii) land ownership must not be disputed;\n(iv) each component must be technically feasible;  (v)  the  areas for  specific  interventions  must\nbe  accessible;  (vi)  most  potential  beneficiaries  should  belong  to  landless  and/or  low  income\nhouseholds  and  should  be  willing  and  able  to  participate;  (vii)  each  subproject  must  have  an\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  at  least  12  percent;  and  (viii)  the  potential  environmental\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nimpacts  must  be  within  acceptable \nenvironmental guidelines,19 and should include the provision for mitigation, if necessary. FD will\napprove the  remaining  subproject feasibility  reports  as  long as  they  are  in  conformity  with  the\ncriteria.\n\nlevels  as  determined \n\n47.\nThe Project consists of three components; (i) participatory forest planning, management,\nand  awareness;  (ii)  sustainable  forest  resource  development  and  management;  and  (iii)\ninstitutional strengthening for improved sector performance.\n\n1.\n\nParticipatory Forest Planning, Management, and Awareness\n\na. \n\nDelineation, Demarcation, Survey, and Mapping\n\n48.\nIn  the  17  forest  divisions  covered,  the  Project  will  support  surveying  and  demarcating\nboundaries with the close consultation, and participation of local communities. A total of 17,500\nkilometers (km) of surveying and demarcation will  be  completed  to establish permanent forest\nareas and facilitate integrated forest  resource  management planning and  implementation.  The\ninitial estimates of the total periphery of the forest areas are 13,000 km for natural forests and\n4,500 km for the forest plantations, with priority given to the demarcation of blocks exceeding 20\nha.  The  procedure  for  surveying  will  involve  community  consultation  to  obtain  a  consensus\nabout the locations of forest boundaries. Concrete boundary pillars will then be installed. Next,\nthe survey maps and records will be updated. Consistent with the NFP management categories,\nFD  will  produce  forest  type  and  management  maps  based  on  the  results  of  the  participatory\nforest planning and demarcation process.\n\nb.\n\nIntegrated Management Planning\n\nThe  SYIP  will  be  implemented  at  the  forest  division  level.  The  Project  will  support\n49.\npreparation  of  IFRMPs  by  FD  in  consultation  with  the  participating  stakeholders.  IFRMPs  will\ninclude  forest  mapping,  classification,  assessment  of  growing  stocks  and  assessments  of\nforests in terms of species diversity, as a basis for determining principal management regimes,\npractices,  and  annual  harvesting  levels.  Moreover,  IFRMPs  will  be  developed  for  each  forest\nmanagement  unit. \nlocal\ncommunities and key provincial agencies, to link district development plans and land  resource\ndevelopment initiatives to forest sector needs and priorities.\n\nIFRMP  preparation  will  be  complemented  by  workshops \n\nfor \n\n                                               \n19 Asian  Development  Bank.  1991.  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agriculture and Natural Resources\n\nDevelopment Project.\n\n\fc.\n\nAwareness and Extension\n\n13\n\n50.\nEnhancing  MFE\u2019s  and  FD\u2019s  capacity  for  implementing  an  effective  awareness  and\nextension  campaign  will  strengthen  their  participatory  forestry  capacities.  Assistance  will  be\nprovided  to  MFE  and  FD  through  equipment  for  the  media  unit,  and  the  development  of  an\nawareness and extension program. The awareness campaign will highlight timber transport and\ntrade  deregulation  and  its  role  in  promoting  tree  growing,  sustainable  forest  resource\nmanagement, and the economic and financial value of forests. The campaign will also promote\nother  policy  and  institutional  changes  to  encourage  participatory  forest  sector  development.\nMedia campaigns pertaining to the role of forests and forestry in the well-being of people will be\ntargeted at planners, politicians, nonforestry institutions, and local communities. To support the\nawareness  program,  the  Project,  through  the  local  schools,  will  help  establish  a  network  of\nenvironmental societies, with a total membership of 100,000 people.\n\n51.\nDemonstration plots will be established to introduce the best practices in forest and short\nrotation  woodlot  management,  and  in  agroforestry,  with  a  special  focus  on  the  participating\ncommunity  members. Other  government extension agencies,  NGOs,  and  CBOs  with  requisite\ncapacity, will be mobilized to provide TA to the communities living near forest boundaries. The\nProject  will  help  increase  the  productivity  of  agricultural  crops  and/or  livestock,  and  provide\nother supporting services such as marketing intelligence and information.\n\n2.\n\nSustainable Forest Resource Development and Management\n\n52.\nThe  Project  will  support  field  interventions  that  are  technically  appropriate,  socially\nacceptable,  financially  viable,  and  directly  contribute  to  achieving  the  project  objectives.  Field\nactivities will include (i) participatory forest resource development and management of degraded\nand  non-degraded  forestlands,  (ii)  participatory  rehabilitation  and  management  of  protected\nforests, and (iii) management of production forests.\n\na.\n\nParticipatory Forest Resource Development and Management\n\ni.\n\nCommunity-Based Agroforestry and Social Forestry\nDevelopment\n\n53.\nThe proposed agroforestry woodlot model will help reestablish permanent tree cover on\nshifting cultivation forestlands by improving tenurial rights. The Project will help the participants\nsecure long-term lease that cover at least 1 harvest cycle (rotation), provide tree seedlings for\ngrowing timber and fruit trees in combination with agriculture crops, and fund labor costs for tree\nplanting and maintenance over a two-year period. Beneficiaries will ensure protection and long-\nterm  maintenance  of  the  woodlots  during  the  first  rotation,  and  will  be  responsible  for\nestablishing the trees for a second rotation. FD will receive 20 percent of the final harvest from\nthe  first  rotation,  to  pay  for  woodlot  establishment  costs.  Use  of  the  agroforestry  model  will\nincrease  the  functional  boundaries  of  the  forest  estate;  enrich  local  agroecosystems;  and\ndiversify product and income streams, thus increasing the income to the local communities. The\nspecies  mix  and  technical  specifications  to  be  developed  during  the  participatory  land-use\nplanning exercise will be tailored to maximize benefits to women and other household workers\nwho  currently  contribute  most  of  the  labor  to  land  management  activities.  CBOs/NGOs  will\nfacilitate the exercise for households that have a lease agreement.\n\n54.\nThis  model  is  estimated  to  be  implemented  on  8,600  ha  of  smallholder  agroforestry\nwoodlots. Of this area, about 2,500 ha are in the core SPAs with an indicative target of 6,100 ha\nin the additional SPAs. An estimated 7,500 households will benefit from the activity. Households\nheaded  by  women  will  participate  through  participatory  land-use  planning,  decision  making\n\n\f14\n\nabout species mix and management regimes, secure land and usufruct tenurial agreements in\ntheir names, and preferential targeting of project inputs such as FD\u2019s extension assistance. FD\nwill  use  these  sites  as  demonstration  models  to  extend  improved  coppicing  and  tree  tending\ntechniques.\n\nii.\n\nImproved Management of Existing Woodlots\n\n55.\nThe Project will assist approximately 8,000 farmers to increase their  ability  to  generate\nincome  from  existing  woodlots  by  providing  support  for  establishment  of  long-term  tenure  to\ntheir  plots.  This  support  will  include  surveying  of  boundaries,  their  registration  with  FD,  and\nprovision  of  technical  extension  and  marketing  to  support  improved  decision  making  to\nmaximize  the  value of existing  crops and  returns from the  reforestation program.  To  reinforce\nand  institutionalize  FD\u2019s  forestry  extension  capacity,  Regional  Forest  Officers  will  develop  a\nplanned and programmed extension package for woodlot lessees. The Project will support the\ndevelopment of demonstration plots on selected woodlots where farmers  will  be  able to  \u201clearn\nby doing\u201d woodlot maintenance and management. The Project will provide technical extension\nmaterials and manuals for distribution to participating farmers (including wall charts, marketing\ninformation  services,  and  techniques  for  estimating  the  value  of  tree  crops).  The  extension\nmaterials will be developed for both teak and eucalyptus woodlots. The total scope for improving\nexisting woodlot management is 7,300 ha, of which about 2,500  ha  is estimated  to  be  in  core\nSPAs and 4,800 ha  in  the  additional  SPAs.  The  assistance  to  be  provided by the  consultants\nwill aim at increasing the plantation productivity and financial returns on investment.\n\niii.\n\nRehabilitation and Management of Degraded Plantations\n\n56.\nLocal  CBOs  and  beneficiaries  will  be  encouraged  to  convert  FD\u2019s  unproductive\nplantations  into  financially  viable  plantations.  The  Project  includes  the  extraction  of  existing\ncommercial  grade  timber  or  fuelwood,  and  reestablishment  of  plantations  with  appropriate\nspecies  mix  and  adequate  post-planting  maintenance.  A  total  of  12,600  ha  (equivalent  to  40\npercent  of  the  current  area  of  productive  plantations)  will  be  rehabilitated  and  converted  into\nproductive  and  financially  viable  plantations.  Site  preparation,  including  felling  and  stump\nremoval, will be bid out competitively. The core SPAs  have  about 3,800  ha of  such  sites, and\nthe additional SPAs about 8,800 ha more.\n\nb.\n\nParticipatory Rehabilitation and Management of Protected Forests\n\ni.\n\nBuffer Zone Development for Multiple-Use Forestry\n\n57.\nThe  Project  will  support  intensification  of  agricultural  production  and  enhanced  farm\nincomes in encroached areas as a means to reduce forest conversion. The Project will support\nthe delivery of extension services from appropriate agencies, development of community-based\nparticipatory  land-use  planning,  building  of  conflict  management  capacity  through  provision  of\nfacilitators,  and  group  processes.  Existing  CBOs  will  be  fully  involved  in  such  processes.\nWherever  CBOs  cannot  be  found,  experienced  NGOs  will  be  involved  in  mobilizing  the\ncommunities  and  facilitating  farmer  participation.  Assessing  the  potential  uses  of  natural\nresources will be supported to determine allowable harvest levels and to develop strategies for\nbuffer zone land and biomass resource development. The Project will support such activities on\nabout 2,800 ha (1,400 ha in core SPAs and about 1,400 ha in the additional SPAs).\n\n\f15\n\nii.\n\nEnrichment Planting20 and Management of Protection and\nOther Natural Forests\n\n58.\nThe  Project  will  support  FD\u2019s  conservation  operations  and  protection  of  the  natural\nforests.  This  will  include  increased  forest  protection  to  encourage  natural  regeneration,  and\nenrichment planting with appropriate species to enhance forest diversity. Under this component,\nenrichment  planting  will  be  carried  out  in  areas  where,  due  to  reduced  rainfall  and/or\ndegradation,  natural  regeneration  may  not  occur.  In  these  areas,  the  Project  will  support\nenrichment planting of appropriate  species  and  monitor  their development  to  identify  the  most\npromising species for natural forest restoration. This component is estimated to cover 1,300 ha\n(400 ha in the core SPAs and about 900 ha in additional SPAs).\n\nc.\n\nProduction Forest Management\n\ni.\n\nImprovement, Rehabilitation, and Management of Degraded\nPlantations\n\n59.\nThe Project  will  support  FD  to  (i)  upgrade  existing  and  introduce  new  technologies  for\nimproved  planting  stock  production;  harvesting  techniques;  and  forest  stand  establishment,\nrehabilitation,  and  maintenance;  and  (ii)  improve  stand  regeneration  and  restoration  practices\nfor  establishing  and  managing  commercially  viable  plantations.  To  ensure  adequate\nregeneration and return on investments, and acceptable growth rates and yields, the Project will\nsupport  three  years  of  post  planting  maintenance.  The  Project  will  also  support  the  import  of\nseeds  for  improving  the  planting  stock.  Private  sector  participation  in  stand  maintenance  and\nharvesting  will  be  facilitated  using  open  tender  systems  to  improve  the  cost  effectiveness,\naccountability,  and \nthe\ndevelopment  of  open  tendering  systems  and  train  private  sector  contractors  in  the  forestry\ncodes  of  practice  to  be  adopted  by  FD.  Harvesting  techniques  that  reduce  waste,  including\ndirectional felling, will be employed. The total scope under this component is 5,600 ha (1,800 ha\nin core SPAs and 3,800 additional SPAs).\n\nforestry  operations.  The  Project  will  support \n\ntransparency  of \n\nii.\n\nPrivate Sector Pilot Leasehold Management of\nState Plantations\n\n60.\nThe  Project  will  facilitate  pilot-level  private  sector  investment  in  the  management  and\ndevelopment  of  state forest  plantations.  The  Project  will  facilitate  the  transfer  of  management\nrights (including rights to harvest the existing stock) of plantations from FD to the private sector.\nThe areas to be transferred will be identified during IFRMP feasibility studies and private sector\nentities will be responsible for reestablishing and maintaining second rotation crops. The Project\nwill facilitate the involvement of up to five private sector entities, each to manage no less than\n1,000 ha of existing plantations and 200 ha of degraded plantations.\n\n61.\nThe  Project  will  support  FD  in  the  development  of  legal  documentation,  tendering,\ntransfer of assets, development of environmental safeguards and guidelines, and development\nof  monitoring  and  evaluation  processes.  This  will  include  the  development  of  prequalification\ntechniques,  development  of  an  appropriate  tendering  and  negotiation  process,  preparation  of\nbid documentation, and the establishment of holding companies as appropriate. A total area of\n6,000  ha  is  included  in  this  activity  (about  2,400  ha  in  core  SPAs  and  3,600  ha  in  additional\nSPAs).\n\n                                               \n20 A method of planting seedlings under existing forest covers to enhance the forest\u2019s productivity and commercial\n\nvalue.\n\n\f3.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening for Improved Sector Performance\n\n16\n\n62.\nThis  component  consists  of  human  resources  development  and  technical  support  for\npolicy  and  institutional  reforms.  Human  resources  development  will  be  achieved  through\nappropriate training activities for FD staff and participating growers and farmers. FD\u2019s  regional\nand  divisional  operations  will  be  strengthened  through  provision  of  equipment  and  adequate\noperating  budgets.  Workshops,  seminars,  and  hands-on \nthe  participating\ncommunities  will  be  included  in  this  component.  Women  at  all  levels  will  be  encouraged  to\nparticipate  in  training  and  the  Project  will  proactively  try  to  ensure  that  at  least  40  percent  of\ntrainees at all levels are women. To facilitate increased decentralization in the reorganized FD,\nthe  Project  will  provide  facilities  in  the  field  for  (i)  three  new  regional  deputy  CFs  along  with\nnecessary equipment and resource inputs and offices and quarters; and (ii) the establishment of\noffices and quarters for one Divisional Forest Officer and one Regional Forest Officer.\n\ntraining \n\nfor \n\n63.\nThe  Project  will  help  upgrade  and  strengthen  the  training  capacities  of  Sri  Lanka\nForestry  Institute  (SLFI).  First,  a  plan  will  be  put  in  place  to  upgrade  the  knowledge  and\nexpertise  of  the  institute  teaching  staff.  On  a  rotating  basis  and  over  two  years,  each  staff\nmember  will  be attached  to  a consultant  team and  will  help  prepare  IFRMPs,  thereby  gaining\nfirsthand experience in applied forestry. The consultant team will provide hands-on training and\nensure  knowledge  transfer  to  the  SLFI  staff.  Then,  each  staff  member  will  undertake  an\nintensive  training  course  in  his  or  her  area  of  specialization,  including  a  two-month  intensive\ncourse in teaching methods. In the second year, in addition to the in-class teaching, the trained\nstaff  will  assist the  IFRMP  teams  in  providing hands-on training  to trainees  and  FD field  staff.\nThis  mode  of  training  will  orient  new  FD  staff  to  the  practice  of  forestry  rather  than  purely\nadministration work. On completion  of  training,  the foresters  will be able  to  transfer  their  skills\nand  knowledge  to  the  other  FD  staff.  Regional  Forest  Officer  trainees  will  have  at  least  six\nmonths  of  in-class  training  to  consolidate  their  skills  and  knowledge  base  in  applied  forestry.\nSLFI facilities will also be expanded, including the construction of an auditorium.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n64.\nThe Project cost is estimated at $40.0 million, of which $5.7 million is foreign exchange\ncost and $34.3 million is the local currency cost. Table 1 summarizes these cost estimates. The\ndetailed cost estimates are set out in Appendix 5.\n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nComponent 1: Participatory Forest Planning,\n\nManagement, and Awareness\n\nComponent 2: Sustainable Forest Development\n\nand Management\n\nComponent 3: Institutional Strengthening for\n\nImproved Sector Performance\n\nTotal Base Cost\nInterest Charge\nTotal Cost to be Financed\n\n2.3\n\n0.8\n\n2.2\n\n5.3\n0.4\n5.7\n\n14.5\n\n16.7\n\n  3.1\n\n34.3\n 0.0\n34.3\n\n16.8\n\n17.5\n\n  5.3\n\n39.6\n  0.4\n40.0\n\n\fD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n17\n\n65.\nIt is proposed that ADB finance  $27.0 million equivalent (68 percent of the project cost)\nincluding  $5.7  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $21.3  million  of  local  currency  cost\nequivalent. The Government will provide $10.0 million in local costs including taxes and duties.\nIn addition, beneficiaries will contribute, in kind, a total of $3.0 million through labor for various\nreforestation activities.

The program is required to enable Sri Lanka to\nmove to a higher  level  of development and  reduce  its high  rate  of  poverty.  In  recent  years,  the\nGovernment has recognized severe  limits on public sector financing of the  country\u2019s  investment\nprogram.  Accordingly,  the  Government  has  taken  a  number  of  important  actions  to  mobilize\nnonbudget  investment,  including an ambitious privatization program  in  key  sectors  such  as  civil\naviation,  telecommunications,  and  the  plantation  industry.  In  1997  and  1998,  the  Government\ncounter-guaranteed  private  sector  borrowing  on  the  international  capital  market  under  ADB\u2019s\nguarantee  scheme.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  secured  substantial  private  investment  in\ncapital intensive industries such as power supply and ports. The Government, with ADB support,\nhas initiated an ambitious private sector development program in 2000, aiming to further privatize\nand restructure state-owned enterprises and address labor market rigidities to accelerate private\nsector investments and raise industrial productivity and cost efficiency.\n\n67.\nNevertheless, the Government\u2019s capacity to self-finance the public investment program in\nthe  coming  years  is  expected  to  remain  limited,  as  debt  servicing  and  the  costs  related  to  the\nongoing  civil  conflict  continue  to  absorb  about  50  percent  of  budget  outlays.  The  1999  budget\ndeficit was 8.0 percent of GDP. While this was better than the 9.2 percent of GDP in 1998, it is still\nhigh. The deficit was largely because receipts from the goods and services tax introduced in 1998\nwere lower than anticipated and the outlays on capital investment and defense were higher. While\nthe Government intends to reduce the budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2002, in 2000, it has\nbeen projected at 7.6 percent of GDP, a slight improvement over 1999. Therefore, continued ADB\nsupport  for  local  cost  financing  is  justified  in  view  of  the  (i)  prevailing  difficult  country\ncircumstances,  (ii)  need  for  a  substantial  investment  program  to  successfully  move  to  a  higher\ngrowth path, and  (iii) the Project\u2019s predicted impact on the level of poverty in the areas adjacent to\nthe natural forests.\n\n\f18\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization and Management\n\nMFE will be the Executing Agency for the Project. Within MFE, FD will carry out day-to-\n68.\nday implementation of the Project. To ensure effective implementation of the sector  approach,\nan  adequately  staffed  national  project  implementation  unit  (NPIU)  and  a  project  steering\ncommittee (PSC) will be constituted at MFE. The NPIU will provide the required administrative\nand  implementation  support  to  FD  at  the  MFE  level  to  ensure  timely  and  uninterrupted\nimplementation  of field  activities.  A  project  director  was  appointed  before  loan  negotiations  to\nhead  the  national  NPIU.  The  project  director  is  a  senior  officer  with  adequate  technical  and\nadministration  experience  and  qualifications  acceptable  to  ADB.  Adequate  administrative  and\ntechnical  staff  will  support  the  NPIU.  The  NPIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overall  coordination\nand liaison of project activities with departments and agencies outside  MFE;  (ii)  administrative\nand implementation support to FD to ensure timely project implementation;  (iii) coordination of\nthe  submission  of  the  first  two  subproject  feasibility  reports  to  ADB  for  approval,  and  for\nensuring  that  approval  of  the  remaining  subprojects  is  obtained  in  accordance  with  criteria\nagreed  with  ADB;  (iv)  assuring  that  the  approvals  for  in-country  and  overseas  training  are\nprovided in a timely fashion; and (v) benefit monitoring and evaluation. MFE will provide office\nspace for consultants within its existing building and transportation support.\n\n69. Within FD, the officers to whom the required financial and administrative authority will be\ndelegated  will  implement  field  operations.  The  CF  for  operations  will  be  responsible  for\npreparation  of  IFRMPs  and  the  subproject  feasibility  reports,  capacity  building  operations,\nprovision  of  guidance  to  the  consultants,  and  implementation  of  all  field  activities  through  the\nrestructured FD in accordance with the prescriptions of IFRMPs. In the preparation of subproject\nfeasibility  reports  and  the  IFRMPs,  the  CF  for  operations  will  be  assisted  by  (i)  a  technical\nservices  team  comprising  FD\u2019s  policy  planning  and  monitoring,  social  forestry  and  extension,\nconservation and production, and law enforcement divisions; and (ii) a team of consultants.\n\n70.\nRegional project implementation units (RPIUs) with adequate professional and technical\nstaff will be set up at the regional levels, and divisional project implementation units (DPIUs) will\noversee day-to-day operations and  supervise all field  operations.  The  regional  Deputy  CF  will\nhead  the  RPIU.  Consistent  with  the  IFRMP,  each  DPIU  in  consultation  with  the  RPIU  and\nparticipating  stakeholders,  will  prepare  an  annual  operating  plan  giving  the  physical  and\nfinancial dimensions of the activities. The NPIU, guided by the RPIUs, will aggregate this into a\nproject-level  annual  work  plan  and  budget.  The  project  director  will  ensure  timely  budgetary\nallocation and flow of funds to the operating levels. DPIUs will be responsible for microplanning\nand  monitoring  microlevel  Project \nfor  project\nimplementation is provided in Appendix 6.\n\nimplementation.  The  organization  chart \n\n2.\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\nThe Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  seven  years  (2001-2007).  The  NPIU\n71.\nwas  established  and  adequately  staffed  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB  prior  to  loan\nnegotiations.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  divisional  forest  officers  have  adequate\nauthority,  especially  technical  and  management  decision  making  powers,  to  effectively\nimplement  the  activities  prescribed  in  the  IFRMPs.  To  ensure  effective  implementation,  loan\neffectiveness will be contingent upon (i) establishment of the PSC, (ii) assignment of the CF for\noperations  and  his  or  her  support  staff,  (iii)  establishment  of  DPIUs  in  each  core  subproject\ndivision,  and  (iv)  preparation  of  proforma  agreements  for  implementing  partners.  The\nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 7.\n\n\f19\n\nThe  first  year  of  Project  implementation  will  be  devoted  to  (i)  making  the  NPIU\n72.\noperational  and  constituting  the  PSC  at  MFE;  (ii)  mobilizing  and  deploying  personnel;  (iii)\nfinalization  of  the  new  forest  legislation  and  regulations;  (iv)  procuring  required  materials,\nequipment, and vehicles, and engagement  of  consultants;  (v)  initiating  IFRMP  processes,  and\npreparation of feasibility studies for the first set of additional subprojects; and (vi) commencing\nthe  surveys  and  delineation and demarcation  of  permanent  forest  estates.  The  preparation  of\nfeasibility  studies  and  IFRMPs  for  additional  SPAs  will  be  phased  in  within  two  years  after\ninception.  The  CF  in  operations,  with  the  assistance  of  the  technical  service  team  and  the\nproject  consultants,  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  feasibility  studies  for  the  remaining\nsubprojects and the IFRMPs. This will be phased in over the first two years of the Project. This\nexercise  will  run  concurrently  with  the  three  core  subprojects.  The  first  two  additional\nsubprojects\u2019 feasibility reports will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval.\n\n3. \n\nBeneficiary Participation\n\nBeneficiary participation  and  bottom-up planning have been  incorporated  in  the project\n73.\ndesign to ensure full commitment and ownership by potential beneficiaries of the development\nactivities. The prospective beneficiaries must continue to participate  in project  implementation.\nOngoing  forestry  projects  and  pilot  projects  show  that  farmers  benefit  most  through  their\nparticipation  in  project  planning  and  implementation.  Participating  farmers  know  that  these\nactivities  will  deliver  sustainable  benefits  to  them,  although  not  immediately  after  the  tree\nplanting. The Project will provide financial incentives to the beneficiaries by providing them with\nseeds,  seedlings,  fertilizers,  and  extension  information  that  has  proven  to  be  successful  in\nenhancing  the  active  participation  of  beneficiaries.  Qualified  CBOs/NGOs  will  be  engaged  by\nRPIUs to assist the active participation of beneficiaries. Criteria for selecting CBOs and NGOs\ninclude (i) experience relevant to the project activities, (ii) ties with the project area, (iii) financial\ncapability, and (iv) record of proven competence in group formation.\n\n4. \n\nSubsidies\n\n74.\nThe Project will provide incentives or subsidies amounting to $6.0 million  (15 percent of\nthe  total  cost)  to farmers.  The  inputs  for  planting  and  maintaining  trees  on  public  land  will  be\nprovided free of charge, and farmers  will  be  paid for their  labor.  Cost of  the  incentives  will  be\nrecovered  in  full  through  the  sale  of  harvested  trees  on  the  basis  of  the  cost-sharing  formula\nagreed between the beneficiaries and  FD.  The  subsidies  are  essential to encourage  land  and\nresource  poor farmers to  participate  in  the  project  implementation,  and  will  have  no  recurrent\nbudgetary  implications,  as  these  will  be  terminated  upon  the  completion  of  the  Project.  The\nsubsidies are  justified because  (i)  most  trees are  to be planted on  Government  land and  at  a\ncost  20-30  percent  lower  than  that  of  the  traditional  reforestation  approaches;  (ii)  the\nenvironmental  benefits  of  the  Project  in  terms  of  increased  soil  and  water  conservation  will\nexceed  the  cost  of  the  subsidies;  and  (iii)  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  subsidized  activities\ninvolve beneficiaries who are living below the poverty line and can not donate their labor at this\nstage.\n\n5.\n\nProject Coordination\n\n75.\nTo  maintain  transparency  in  project  implementation  and  to  facilitate  national  level\ncoordination  with  various  agencies  and  institutions,  the  PSC  will  be  constituted  prior  to  loan\neffectiveness.  The PSC  will be  chaired by  the  secretary,  MFE  with  the  project  director  as  the\nmember and secretary. Members will include directors of the External  Resources  Department,\nNational  Planning  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning,  secretaries  of  related\n\n\f20\n\nministries,21  and  NGOs.  The  PSC  will  meet  every  six  months  to  discuss  progress  of  project\nimplementation, identify and address constraints, resolve conflicts, and provide policy direction,\nif any.\n\n76.\nAt  the  division  level  of  FD,  coordination  will  be  provided  by  a  divisional  coordination\ncommittee  (DCC)  headed  by  the  district  secretary,  with  the  Divisional  Forest  Officer  as  the\nmember and secretary and representatives of the concerned departments and agencies, CBOs,\nand  participating  NGOs  as  members.  The  DCC  will  be  constituted  prior  to  loan  effectiveness\nand will meet every quarter to discuss progress of Project implementation, identify and address\nconstraints,  resolve  conflicts,  and  ensure  that  there  is  no  duplication  or  overlap  of  Project\nactivities.\n\n6.\n\nOperational Maintenance\n\n77.\nMFE will be responsible for maintaining (and replacing if necessary) the Project facilities,\nincluding civil works, equipment, and other investments under the Project. The Government will\nensure that all additional staff required for maintenance of the project facilities are appointed in\na  timely  manner.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  provision  for  up-keep  and\nmaintenance is provided in each annual budget. Protection and maintenance of natural forests,\ncommercial plantations, and buffer zones in conservation areas and reforestation activities, will\nbe carried out through participatory arrangements with CBOs and private companies (in case of\nprivate sector commercial plantations) under the FD\u2019s overall supervision. The exact manner of\nprotection and maintenance will depend on the nature of the activity and will be governed by the\nterms and conditions of agreements and leases entered into with beneficiaries, CBOs, and other\nstakeholders.\n\n7.\n\nProject Reviews, Monitoring, and Evaluation\n\nProject  activities  and  performance  are  to  be  monitored  through  regular  reviews.  In\n78.\naddition  to  regular  ADB  review  missions,  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  and  detailed\nevaluation of the Project will be undertaken jointly by ADB, MFE, and FD in the third year. The\nmidterm review will be linked to completion of the feasibility studies for additional SPAs. Using\nbase  line  socioeconomic  data  generated  through  the  initial  social  analysis,  the  detailed\nevaluation  will  include  (i)  the  assessment  of  the  project  design  and  scope  as  formulated  at\nappraisal; (ii) enhancement of  FD\u2019s  capacity for  effective  implementation,  and  effectiveness  of\nPIUs  in  implementing  the  Project;  (iii)  physical  and  financial  progress  of  implementation\n(including contracts and disbursements), and performance of consultants; (iv) performance and\nparticipation  of  CBOs,  poverty  reduction  impacts,  and  level  of  women\u2019s  participation;  and  (v)\nperformance of private sector enterprises. Based on these evaluations, the project design may\nbe  modified  and  the  project  scope  and  implementation  arrangements  adjusted,  and  another\ncomprehensive review will be carried out in the sixth year of implementation to assess the initial\nimpact of the Project.\n\n79.\nProject evaluations will employ independent sample socioeconomic surveys with formats\nconsistent  with  the  1999  baseline  survey,  using  repeat  measurements  and  the  same\nparticipants.  In  addition,  the  harvests  in  farmers\u2019  agroforestry  woodlots,  and  commercial\nplantations will be surveyed, covering records of harvest, magnitude of participant benefits, and\nuse  of  forest-derived  income.  These  data  will  serve  as  inputs  to  the  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation  of  the  Project.  In  addition  to  standard  socioeconomic  indicators  such  as  family\nincome  and employment generation,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  specifically  include\n                                               \n21 \n\nIncluding the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, (under which ADB\u2019s proposed Protected  Area\nManagement  and  Wildlife  Conservation  Project  is  being  prepared),  and  the  Survey  Department  and  Land\nCommissioner Department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands.\n\n\f21\n\nquantifiable indicators of the participation of women and vulnerable groups in project activities.\nThe benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  take  due  account  of  the  approaches  and  guidance\nprovided under the ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A Handbook for Bank Staff, Staff\nof the Executing Agencies and Consultants of March 1992.\n\n8.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n80.\nAll  supplies,  equipment,  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Most of the items to be procured, such as\nbasic equipment and materials (herbicides, fungicides, seeds, fertilizers, seedling bags) will be\nspread over a wide area in various subprojects and therefore will be procured centrally for cost\nefficiency.  They  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  domestic  procurement\nprocedures acceptable to ADB.  Supply  contracts for equipment  or  materials not  anticipated  to\nexceed  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  will  be  carried  out  through  international  shopping.  Other\nmiscellaneous  equipment  and  supplies,  with  each  package  valued  below  the  equivalent  of\n$100,000, will be procured by direct purchase procedures.\n\n81.\nCivil  works  include  construction  of  the  SLFI  auditorium;  the  regional  offices  in\nAnuradhapura,  Nuwara  Eliya    and  Badulla  and  Ratnapura;  staff  quarters  in  the  field;  and  the\nroad  in  Sinharaja  reserve  forests.  As  qualified  local  contractors  are  available  and  foreign\ncontractors are unlikely to be interested in bidding, local competitive bidding procedures will be\napplied  for  civil  works  contracts.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  show  that  it  has  allocated\nannual  maintenance  budgets  for  regular  upkeep  of  the  roads  and  the  buildings  constructed\nunder the Project.\n\n82.\nBoundary  surveys  will  be  contracted  by  the  NPIU  following  the  demarcation  of\nboundaries in a fully participatory manner by  FD.  The  demarcation  will  be  carried out  in  close\ncollaboration with the Survey Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, which will\nsupervise  the  registered  surveyors  contracted  by  each  forest  division.  Boundary  demarcation\nwill be completed 15 months after the loan effectiveness. The Survey Department has agreed to\nwork closely with FD in implementing this component, and the two departments have signed an\nagreement to this effect. The Survey Department will (i) review the bidding documents and help\nthe project director collaborate with FD in prequalification and short-listing of firms based on the\nDepartment  Survey  regulations  cleared  by  ADB,  and  (ii)  supervise  the  field  work.  The\ncontracting  will  be  through  the  project  director  using  the  Survey  Department\u2019s  usual  contract\nprocedures  and  will  involve  a  prequalification  process,  a  performance  bond,  and  provision  to\nsupport field staff.\n\n9. \n\nConsulting Services\n\nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  by  an  internationally  recruited  consulting  firm  in\n83.\nassociation  with  a  local  consulting firm,  engaged  in accordance  with the  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements on the use of domestic consultants satisfactory\nto  ADB.  Services  of  NGOs  will  be  acquired  by  MFE/FD  in  consultation  with  ADB  based  on\nagreed  criteria  acceptable  to  ADB.  Consulting  services  will  assist  project  implementation.\nConsulting services will comprise 77 person-months of international and 153 person-months of\ndomestic consultants. Appendix 8 provides the outline terms of reference for consultants.\n\n10.\n\nTraining, Workshops, and Seminars\n\n84.\nMFE/FD,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants  and  in  consultation  with  other  associated\nagencies, will prepare a comprehensive training program for ADB\u2019s approval within six months\nof loan effectiveness. The  training  will  be  undertaken  within  Sri Lanka  as far as possible.  The\n\n\f22\n\ntraining  program  will  specify  (i)  the  number  of  staff  to  be  trained  each  year,  (ii)  criteria  for\nselection of candidates, (iii) institutions proposed, (iv) types of  training  courses,  (v) duration  of\ntraining, and (vi) estimated cost. In supporting these training programs as a means to capacity\nbuilding,  the officials  who  benefit from  training  will  be  assigned  responsibilities  commensurate\nwith the new skills they will acquire  through  the  training. Accordingly,  the  trainees  will  have to\nagree to be retained in their positions in accordance with Government guidelines.\n\n85. Workshops  and  seminars  in  the  field  for  buffer  zone,  forest  protection,  farmers\u2019\nagroforestry  woodlots,  plantation  interventions,  public  awareness,  and  social  sensitization\n(including gender sensitization of CBOs and FD field staff and participants) will be coordinated\nand organized by SLFI, with expertise from appropriate sources. The workshops and seminars\nwill  be  targeted  at  CBOs  and  community  organizers,  village  leaders,  private  sector  investors,\nand the concerned FD field staff.\n\n11.\n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports\n\nTo ensure timely release of loan proceeds, an imprest account will be established in Sri\n86.\nLanka\u2019s central bank immediately after the effective date of the Loan Agreement in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook  of  June  1996.  The  initial  deposit  will  be  based  on\nestimated expenditures for the first four months of project implementation but will not exceed an\nequivalent  of  $200,000.  The  deposit  will  be  used  for  payment  of  all  eligible  local  and  foreign\nexpenditures financed under the loan. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will\nbe used for reimbursement or liquidation of the advance in the imprest account, for expenditure\nunder contracts not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000.\n\n87.\nMFE will establish and maintain separate accounts for expenditure under the Project. All\nfinancial  transactions  for  the  Project,  including  those  under  the  ADB  loan,  will  be  recorded\nseparately in the accounts in a manner that allows identification of expenditures on the project\nfacilities provided under the loan. The accounts, together with a record of expenditures, will be\naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of\nreference  are  acceptable  to  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards.  The\nauditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  SOE  procedures  and  the  imprest  account  should  be  set  out\nseparately in the audit report. Within one year after the end of the fiscal year, MFE will submit to\nADB, certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements.\n\n88.\nMFE will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB within one month\nand a half after the period under review. The reports will include information on the progress of\nproject implementation, the proposed program for the following quarter, problems encountered,\nand  measures  adopted  for  their  resolution.  The  reports  will  summarize  financial  information\nsuch as Project expenditures incurred, withdrawal applications submitted, disbursements made\nunder  the  loan,  and  the  Government  budget  allocations  received.  The  reports  will  also  be\nsubmitted  to  the  PSC  and  DCCs. Within  six  months  of  the  completion  of  the  Project,  FD  will\nprepare a project completion report for submission to ADB.\n\n12.\n\nAdvance Procurement Action\n\n89.\nUpon  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  Management  has  approved  advance\nprocurement  action  to  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project.  Advance  procurement\naction  was  required  for  procurement  of  urgently  needed  consultant  services;  materials,\nequipment,  and  vehicles,  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents  and  finalization  of  service\ncontracts  for  surveying,  delineating,  demarcating,  and  mapping  of  forests,  as  well  as  early\nestablishment  of  the  media  center  at  the  MFE.  These  are  time  consuming  processes  and\nadvance  procurement  action  will  facilitate  implementation  of  the  Project\u2019s  urgently  required\n\n\factivities. MFE was advised that approval of advance procurement action does not commit ADB\nto finance the Project.\n\n23\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\nMFE, as the Executing Agency, has primary responsibility for policy planning, legislative\n90.\nand institutional reform, and monitoring. FD is responsible for forestry management. Both MFE\nand  FD  have  satisfactorily  implemented  several  externally  funded  projects.  MFE  is  the  core\nagency  for  environmental  protection  and  natural  resource  management.  MFE  has  staff  with\nexperience  in  externally  assisted  projects.  MFE  has  developed  the  SYIP  that  corresponds  to\npart  of  the  FSMP;  proposed  promulgation  of  a  forestry  ordinance  to  implement  the  NFP;\nsuccessfully  implemented  participatory  and  community  forestry  projects;  and  is  implementing\nwatershed  conservation  projects.  Thus,  MFE  has  demonstrated  the  required  technical  and\nmanagerial  capability  to  implement  a  sector  project  to  meet  the  development  and  forest\nconservation challenges faced by the country.\n\nHowever, MFE and FD traditional structures and procedures emphasize a top-down and\n91.\ncentralized  approach  to  forest  sector  development  and  decision  making.  The  emphasis  has\nbeen on protection and regulatory functions rather than improving the overall performance of the\nforest  sector.  MFE  has  had  limited  impact  on  influencing  the  cross-sectoral  policies  that\nadversely impact forest conservation and development. FD\u2019s current operational structures and\npractices  provide  limited  opportunity for practicing  participatory  forestry.  Furthermore,  frontline\nforestry staff, who are often more in tune with the needs and challenges of forestry, have limited\ndecision making powers and thus often can not be proactive and innovative in their functioning.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nThe Environment\n\n92.\nThe  Project  is  classified  under  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental\nexamination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.22  The\nIEE  shows  that  no  significant adverse  environmental  impact  is  anticipated  and  that  a  detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. The  IEE also  shows  that  the project design\nwill  improve  the  quality  of  the  environment  and  the  welfare  of  the  people  living  in  the  project\narea. Among the Project\u2019s positive contributions to the environment are (i) reduced soil erosion,\n(ii)  reduced  sedimentation  of  reservoirs,  (iii)  increased  conservation  of  natural  forests  and\nwildlife  sanctuaries,  (iv)  increased  coverage  of  plantation  forests,  (v)  increased  fuelwood\nproduction, (vi) better land-use planning, and (vii) efficient land tenure rights. The summary IEE\n(Appendix 9) was prepared and endorsed by the Government.\n\nThe three  core SPAs  represent  the  major  ecological  zones  in  Sri  Lanka:  the  dry  zone\n93.\n(Anuradhapura  district),  montane  zone  (Badulla  and  Nuwara  Eliya  districts),  and  wet  zone\n(Ratnapura  district).  The  three  core  SPAs  demonstrate  the  different  degrees  and  types  of\ndependence of the communities on the forest reserves that subsequently reflect their levels of\nand strategies to cope with poverty.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Measures\n\nThe  1994  demographic  survey  recorded  676,197  people  in  Anuradhapura  dry  zone\n94.\ndistrict.  Farmers  in  the  dry  zone  have  fewer  economic  alternatives  to  escape  poverty  than\n\n                                               \n22    Asian  Development  Bank,  1991,  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agriculture and Natural Resources\n\nDevelopment Projects, Manila.\n\n\f24\n\nfarmers  in  other  zones.  Most  households  engage  in  shifting  cultivation  on  state  land,  which\nsupplies about 30 percent of household income. Income from forest products was approximately\n5 percent of the total income across households. Anuradhapura District has the lowest average\nhousehold  income  among  all  districts  in  Sri  Lanka  in  1990.  The  average  monthly  household\nincome was SLRs2,600 ($35) compared to SLRs3,540 ($48) for Sri Lanka. The PPTA23 survey\nfound  that  70  percent  of  all  sample  households  receive  Samurdhi  (welfare)  payments  for  the\npoor. The fluctuations in the income received by the farm households and its direct linkage with\nseasonality would have made a majority of the farmer households eligible for Samurdhi benefits.\nOf households sampled by the PPTA study, 38 percent were at or below the poverty line while\nmost farmers are just above poverty line. The 1994 survey estimates the population of 750,000\npeople  in  Badulla  and  671,000  in  Nuwara  Eliya  districts.  According  to  the  1990/1991  survey,\nhouseholds in Badulla  and  Nuwara  Eliya  districts  earned 80-84  percent  less  than  the national\naverage of SLRs3,540 ($35) per month. The incidence of poverty in Badulla was 36.8 percent\nand  in  Nuwara  Eliya,  22.6  percent.  In  Badulla,  36  percent  of  children  aged  3-5  were\nunderweight in 1993. In Walapane Division in Nuwara Eliya District, 40 percent of the children\nwere  underweight.  Ratnapura  District  had  917,000  people  in  1994.  Communities  near  forest\nreserves  in  Ratnapura are  less dependent  on forest  products  due  to  tea  production.  The  Tea\nLand Survey in 1994/1995 observed that 84 percent of the tea producers in Ratnapura District\nwere tea smallholders with less than 0.4 ha. The income received from tea ranged between 37\nand 58 percent of the household income for those owning 0.5-1.5 ha. A socioeconomic survey\nof 17 wet zone conservation forests showed that 90 percent of the households extracted forest\nproducts for their domestic use.\n\n95.\nThe full participation of women will be needed to make any changes of land use in and\naround  forest  reserves.  The  Project  will  actively  seek  women\u2019s  input  in  the  integrated  forest\nresource  planning  process  through  socioeconomic  surveys  of  household  uses  of  forest\nresources and  resource  inventories  carried  out by  women.  Buffer  zone  development  activities\nwill  invite  the  participation  of  households  that  have  encroached  on  forestlands  and  offer\nassistance in tea production, leadership training, and savings mobilization.  The assistance  will\nhave  a  direct  impact  on  household  income  and  provide  additional  opportunities  for  women  to\nparticipate in the market economy.\n\nProject interventions have been designed to encourage the communities to see the need\n96.\nfor  reducing  forest  exploitation  and  adopting  conservation  measures.  Public  awareness\ncampaigns will provide information on the value of local forests for (i) community water sources,\n(ii)  rice  irrigation,  and  (iii)  creation  of  beneficial  microclimates  for  tea  production.  At  the  same\ntime  the  Project  will  demonstrate  that  additional  income  can  be  generated  through  improved\nmanagement  of  the  forest  reserves  and  long-term  investment  in  the  existing  smallholding\nwoodlots, tea plantations, home gardens and other cultivated land. The Project will complement\nongoing  Government  efforts  to  address  widespread  poverty  among  its  forest  communities.\nAppendix 10 details the social assessment on poverty alleviation.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nEconomic analysis was carried out for the three core SPAs, which  represent the  major\n97.\nagroecological  zones  and  are  considered  to  be  representative  of  the  wider  project  area.  To\nquantify costs and benefits associated with the distinct physical characteristics of each SPA, the\n\n                                               \n23   TA 3047-SRI: Forest Resource Management Project, for $800,000, approved on 20 July 1998.\n\n\f25\n\nmajor field intervention activities were grouped into (i) new agroforestry plots on encroached FD\nland, (ii) management of existing  community  woodlots,  (iii)  management of encroachment  into\nbuffer  zones and forest  reserves,  (iv) enrichment  of protection  plantations,  (v)  rehabilitation  of\ndegraded  FD  plantations,  (vi)  improved  management  of  teak  and  eucalyptus  plantations,  and\n(vii) pilot private sector concessionaires.  All costs and benefits have been divided into tradable\nand  nontradable  components.  The  former  is  expressed  in  border  prices  and  the  latter  in  the\nvalue  of  foreign  exchange.  The  border  prices  were  estimated  from  domestic  prices  using  a\nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.9.  The  analysis  is  undertaken  using  with  and  without  project\napproaches.\n\n98.\nThe costs at the subproject level include those incurred in the physical development of\nthe  field  interventions,  including  extension  inputs,  planting  and  labor,  survey  and  lease\nagreements,  and  marketing.  In  addition,  costs  of  the  intermediate  services  and  goods\n(component 1) required to successfully implement the Project along with the prerequisite human\nresource development and institutional strengthening (component 3) are apportioned to the core\nSPAs (35 percent) and the additional SPAs (65 percent) based on the relative proportion of field\ninterventions.  A  standard  conversion  factor  was  applied  to  domestic  prices  in  line  with  recent\nADB estimates.  The  opportunity  cost  of  labor  was  derived from applying  a  shadow  wage  rate\nfactor of 0.8 to unskilled labor, which was converted to border prices by applying the standard\nconversion factor.24\n\n99.\nDirect and indirect benefits are included. The direct benefits are realized on-site, such as\nthe  value  of  incremental  output  of  commercial  logs  and  poles  and  of  limited  agricultural\nproduction. The indirect benefits are limited to the enrichment of protection forests in the upland\nagroecological  zone  and  include  the  loss  of  hydroelectric  generating  capacity  based  on  past\nlocal data sets. Where appropriate, income foregone is included as a negative benefit to reflect\nthe  without  project  scenario.  Several  benefits  are  not  quantified  due  to  the  paucity  of  data.\nThese  include  the  value  of  additional  carbon  sequestration  and  the  intrinsic  value  of  habitat\nsaved from ongoing conversion to agricultural use. Carbon sequestration can be estimated but\nthere  is  little  indication of a  willingness  to  pay  for  the  carbon  sequestering  potential  within  Sri\nLanka. Habitat values have been estimated for lowland wet zone forests; however these are not\nlikely  to  reflect  the  average  willingness  to  pay  for  lesser-known  sites  in  Sri  Lanka.  Without  a\nsubstantial research project there is inadequate data to assign such values. The project benefits\nwill  accrue  from  sustainable  forest  management  that  will  provide  logs,  poles,  and  agricultural\ncrops. Border prices  were used for  valuing  logs and  were  adjusted for  transport  and  handling\ncharges.\n\n100.\nThe  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (IRR)  for  the  core  subprojects  range\nfrom 13 percent for Badulla and Nuwara Eliya to 20 percent for Ratnapura. The variation reflects\nthe  differing  production  systems  and  the  high  proportion  of  rehabilitation  and  enrichment\nplanting in the Ratnapura SPA. Details are shown in Appendix 11.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nFinancial  viability  was  tested only for production  systems  that  require a  profit  incentive\n101.\nfor the beneficiary to support the adoption in the project area. Four activities are analyzed, each\nwith the private sector as the primary beneficiary: (i) local communities convert the use of land\nfrom shifting cultivation to diversified agroforestry; (ii) involving woodlots owned or managed by\nlocal  community  members  who  have  little  or  knowledge  on  silviculture  or  marketing  of  trees;\n\n                                               \n24 A  shadow  wage  rate  of  0.8  has  been  used  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  1716-SRI:  Coastal Resource Management\n\nProject, for $40 million, approved on 7 December 1999.\n\n\f26\n\n(iii) the  intensification  of  agricultural  practice  in  encroached  land,  based  on  lowland  tea\nproduction; and (iv) the establishment of private sector forest concession operations.\n\n102.\nThe  characteristics  of  the  production  systems  and  the  financial  IRR  calculations  are\nshown in Appendix 11. The financial IRRs of 13-16 percent reflect the sustainability of the forest\nmanagement regime to meet the return on labor necessary to demonstrate that participants can\nafford  to  invest  their  labor.  The  analysis  is  based  on  partial  cost  recovery  through  labor\ncontributions from beneficiaries and the provision of free forestry materials.\n\n3.\n\nRisks\n\n \n 103.\nThe  major  risks  to  the  Project  are  (i)  delays,  and  noncompliance  with  policy  and\ninstitutional reforms needed for better sector performance, (ii) failure of potential beneficiaries to\nactively participate, and (iii) inefficient coordination between relevant government agencies.\n\n104. Specific  safeguards  against  these  risks  have  been  incorporated  in  the  Project  design.\nFor  (i),  some  reforms  may  not  be  easily  carried  out  due  to  the  lack  of  understanding  among\npeople and political resistance from vested interest groups. This risk will be minimized through\nan effective awareness and extension campaign. The Project includes assistance to establish a\nmedia unit and undertake an awareness and extension program to establish a constituency of\nbeneficiaries,  NGOs,  CBOs,  and  civil  society  to  demand  adherence  to  the  policy  and\ninstitutional reforms. It was agreed that public awareness campaign and extension program will\nbe undertaken  within 6  months after  loan effectiveness.  Furthermore, frequent  policy dialogue\nand  close  monitoring  of  the  time-  bound  policy  and  institutional  reforms  and  timely  corrective\naction from ADB will minimize this risk. For (ii), the extension programs and financial incentives\nwill facilitate beneficiaries\u2019 participation. NGOs and CBOs are expected to play an important role\nin promoting the participatory approach to minimize the risk. For (iii), project implementation will\nbe  carried  out  through  several  coordination  mechanisms.  Through  close  consultation  among\nrelevant  agencies  the  NPIU  and  DCC  at  the  field  level  will  serve  as  effective  coordination\nbodies.  MFE  is  experienced  with  coordinating  various  activities.  Relevant  agencies,  including\nMFE  and  FD,  have  recognized  that  illegal  logging  and  the  high  demand  for  industrial  wood\ncontribute  to  forest  depletion  and  have  taken  strong  measures  to  avoid  overexploitation  by\ncommercial interests. This matter will be discussed during the coordination meetings.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  enhance  the  environmental  conditions  of  the  core  SPAs,25\n105.\nand  is  to  be  undertaken  through  participatory  and  bottom-up  planning  approaches.  The\nenvironmental  impact  screening  has  not  identified  any  significant  adverse  environmental\nimpacts. Minor adverse impacts under the commercial forest management, which far outweigh\nthe benefits, can easily be mitigated.\n\n106.\nThe  main  benefits  expected  from  the  protection  forestry  interventions  and  public\nawareness  and  extension  services  in  the  wet  zone  are  (i)  biodiversity,  soil,  and  water\nconservation in  southwest  Sri Lanka,  an area  with  an  unusually high  concentration of  species\nand with exceptionally high levels of endemism and over 95 percent of the country\u2019s threatened\nplant  and  animal  species;  (ii)  global  importance  for  the  conservation  of  the  world\u2019s  floristic\ndiversity  in  the  highly  threatened  area  of  southwest  Sri  Lanka;  (iii)  the  awareness  of\nconservation  among  peripheral  communities  of  protection  and  conservation  forests  and  the\ngeneral public; and (iv) publication of information relevant to conservation and biodiversity.\n\n                                               \n25  Project interventions are expected to generate similar positive environmental benefits in the additional SPAs.\n\n\f27\n\n107. Reforestation provides  a  range  of  environmental benefits  and  services.  Increasing  tree\ncover  can  increase  soil  fertility  by  improving  moisture  retention,  soil  structure,  and  nutrient\ncontent. Tree cover helps to reduce rapid runoff of rainwater, thereby regulating stream flow and\nimproving  water  quality  by  reducing  sediment  in  surface  waters.  Incorporating  trees  into\nagricultural systems can improve crop yields by improving soil and the microclimate.\n\n108. Commercial  plantation activities  provide  increased  revenue  to  the  Government,  private\nsector  involvement  in  plantation  activities,  and  a  continuous  supply  of  wood  from  plantations.\nAgroforestry  woodlot  activities  will  reduce  the  area  under  shifting  cultivation  and  provide\npermanent  supplementary  income  to  farmers.  Improvements  to  existing  farmer  woodlots  will\nincrease  the  quality and quantity of  wood  coming to the  market.  The  project  interventions  will\nimprove the protection, conservation, and management of forests urgently needing protection by\nreducing or halting the encroachments and illicit felling of timber. The Project will also increase\nthe awareness of conservation among peripheral communities and in the general public. If the\nProject is not implemented, the degradation of resources in these forest reserves will continue.\nThe  proposed  restructuring  of  FD  will  allow  efficient  management  of  forest  resources  in  the\ncountry, which will contribute to the protection of the environment.\n\n109.\nThe  sustainable  management  of  dry  zone  forest  reserves  under  the  social  forestry\ninterventions  will  increase  the  benefit  flow  to  surrounding  communities.  Land  leased  for\nagroforestry  woodlots  will  provide  continued  income  to  the  farmers  and  discourage  shifting\ncultivation.  Improved  management  of  existing  woodlots  will  provide  incentives  for  continued\nsmallholder management.\n\nC.\n\nImpacts on Poverty\n\n110.\nThe Project  will  benefit about  50,000  households  and  directly  generate about  6  million\nperson-days of work for the rural sector. It will have an impact on reducing poverty in the rural\narea, where 35 percent of the population  live  under  the poverty  line.  The  Project  will  increase\nemployment  and  income  generation  opportunities  through  increasing  the  activities  within  the\nforest  and  allied  sectors.  In  rural  communities,  livelihood  adjacent  to  forest  reserves  will  be\nsupported in order to stabilize land use and create greater tenurial certainty over land and trees.\nIn Anuradhapura, approximately 2,500 marginal and landless women and men will receive long-\nterm leases to FD land for agroforestry plots and farmer woodlots (2,500 ha). The provision of\nsupplemental  income  from  the  wood  portion  of  these  plots  helps  to  reduce  household\nvulnerability  during  years  of  poor  rainfall.  About  2,500  farmers  with  woodlots  will  benefit  from\ntraining  and  marketing  activities,  and  will  thus  increase  their  income.  An  annual  increase  of\nhousehold  income  is  estimated  at  SLRs1,000-2,000  ($14-27)  depending  on  the  agroforestry\nmodel.\n\nThe forest  reserve buffer  zone development  intervention  will  be  implemented  in  critical\n111.\ncommunities  of  Ratnapura  wet  zone  district  to  provide  financial  training  and  alternatives  to\nexpanding  the  tea  garden  areas.  Assistance  for  savings  mobilization  and  access  to  existing\nfinancial institutions is expected to help tea smallholders manage their finances for other income\ngenerating  activities.  Additional  interventions  in  Ratnapura  include  rehabilitation  of  degraded\nplantations  (1,250  ha)  and  enrichment and  management  of  protection  forests  (400  ha),  which\nwill have a long-term impact on increasing income and reducing poverty.\n\n112.  A  total  of  about  50,000  beneficiary  household  will  directly  benefit  from  the  Project\nthrough  participation  in  the  reforestation  activities.  Of  the  households  in  core  SPAs,  40-65\npercent  are  below  the  poverty  line  and  will  benefit  from  improved  productive  activities  in\nforestlands, where they will have greater security of tenure, and from employment opportunities\ngenerated by the Project. By deregulating the sector operations and adopting multistakeholder\n\n\f28\n\nand  community-based  resource  development  and  management,  the  Project  will  help  the\nGovernment improve the governance of the sector  by  making all  parties  involved  in  the forest\nsector  more  accountable.  Furthermore, \nimplementation\narrangements  will  ensure  transparency.  More  importantly,  institutionalization  of  participatory\nforestry  management  will  help  make  benefit-sharing from forest  resources  more  accessible  to\nthe local poor and improve the socioeconomic status of the local communities. This will enable\nthem  to  maximize  their  chances  for  being  able  to  access  and  influence  the  development\nprograms and projects that can enhance their livelihoods.\n\nthe  operating  procedures  and \n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n113.  The specific assurances are as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\nMFE  and  FD,  in  consultation  with  the  Survey  Department  of  the  Ministry  of\nAgriculture  and  Lands,  will  prepare  a  time-bound  operational  plan  to  survey,\ndelineate,  demarcate,  map,  and  redraw  forest  boundaries  using  agreed  upon\necological  criteria,  and  the  MFE  and  FD  will  ensure  that  a  management  unit  that\ncontains similar prescriptions is not split as a result of the demarcation.\n\nDuring  2001,  2002,  and  2003,  STC  will  have  guaranteed  access  to  state  forest\nplantations  with  annual  harvesting  rights  over  1,200  ha  (the  level  earmarked  for\n2000) provided the area harvested by STC during 2001, equals or exceeds 1,200 ha\nallocation. If STC is unable to meet the 2001 harvesting target, the annual allocation\nfor 2002 and 2003 will be limited to  the  maximum  area  that  STC harvested during\n2001. Free and open competitive bidding for the remaining area (not less than 600\nha in 2002 and 2003) that is available for harvesting under the existing management\nplans or the IFRMPs, is to be made available to STC and the private sector equally,\nin  accordance  with  open and  competitive  bidding  procedures.  At  the  end  of  2003,\nSTC\u2019s  special  allocation  of  harvesting  rights  will  be  reviewed  by  an  independent\ncommittee  comprising  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  experts  selected  in  consultation\nwith ADB, with the objective of enhancing private sector participation.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Borrower  will  issue  long-term  lease/management-rights  to  all  participating\nfarmers in the woodlots program, and ensure that (a) the CF has delegated power to\nissue  leases  over  state  land;  (b)  until  the  delegation  is  formalized,  the  Land\nCommissioner will facilitate the leasing process; and (c) for private sector leasehold\nmanagement  of  state  forest  plantations  rules  and  procedures  in  line  with  the\nNational Forestry Policy are adopted and formalized.\n\n(iv)  MFE  will  (a)  undertake  a  thorough  public  awareness  campaign  for  forestry\nmanagement  and  deregulation;  (b)  deregulate  nationally, \ntimber  and  wood\nharvesting  and  transport  for  agreed  species  found  on  private  lands,  in  the  agreed\nphased manner, with an annual review conducted jointly; (c) eliminate excess stock\nexaminations of all private wood enterprises by the end of 2001; and (d) conduct a\nreview  by  end  of  2003 for  deregulation  of  jak timber harvesting  and  transport  with\nthe Ministry of Agriculture and Lands.\n\n(v) \n\nBy  31  December  2001,  the  Borrower  will  submit  to  Parliament,  a  bill  to  amend  or\nreplace  the  Forest  Ordinance  and  will  approve  associated  regulations  to  bring  the\nlegislative  framework  in  line  with  the  imperatives  and  strategies  enunciated  in  the\nNational Forest Policy.\n\n\fB.\n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness\n\n29\n\n114.  As  conditions  of  effectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  the  Government  will  have  (i)\nestablished (a) DPIUs in each core subproject division, (b) a PSC at the national level, and (c) a\nDCC within FD; (ii) appointed the required staff to the NPIU and assigned the CF for operations\nand support staff; and (iii) prepared proforma agreements for implementing partners.\n\nVII.\n\n RECOMMENDATION\n\n115.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  20,606,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the\nForest Resources Management Sector Project, with a term of 32

Projects in Sri Lanka\n\n1. \n\nCommunity Forestry Project\n\nThe Community Forestry Project,1 with $10.0 million financed by ADB, was completed in\n1.\n1991.  This  project  aimed  at  supplying  Sri  Lanka  with  needed  fuelwood  and  timber  from\nconventional reforestation in block plantations and a small social forestry component designed\nto  pursue  tree  cultivation  through  community  involvement.  The  Country  Synthesis  of\nPostevaluation in Sri Lanka2 rated the project as generally successful. The report concluded that\nthe  project  had  made  positive  ecological  impacts,  including  soil  conservation,  stabilization  of\nhydrological systems, and creation of wind shelters.\n\n2.\nThe project concept was sound, with a lower risk plantation component being combined\nwith  a  more  innovative  community  forestry  component.  However,  community  participation  in\nreforestation can only be fully achieved if the community is involved throughout the project cycle\nincluding  the  planning  and  monitoring  phase.  Tree  planting  can  conflict  with  peak  agricultural\nactivities,  which  should  be  considered  when  scheduling  implementation  and  determining\ncompensation.  Individual  farm  households  need  immediate  compensation,  such  as  food  for\nwork, to enable them to undertake tree cultivation, particularly during peak season for work on\nagricultural  crops.  To  assure  the  needed  level  and  means  of  community  participation  in  a\nreforestation project, appropriate disciplinary expertise must be employed during the preparation\nof  the feasibility  study and  appraisal.  Participating  families  need  secure  rights  and  benefits  to\nharvest final products with appropriate lease/management agreement.\n\n2.\n\nParticipatory Forestry Project\n\nThe  ongoing  Participatory  Forestry  Project3  commenced  in  1993  and  was  originally\n3.\nscheduled  for  completion  in  1999.  The  project  may  be  extended  into  2000.  The  project  is\ncofinanced  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  which  has\nprovided 30,000 tons of wheat as food aid. The food aid component is to provide farmers with\nas  compensation  for  time  spent  on  tree  planting  and  maintenance  activities.  The  main\nobjectives of the project are to increase villagers\u2019 incomes through participation in reforestation,\nto increase tree planting, and to strengthen the institutional  capacity  of  the  Forest  Department\n(FD). This project built upon the lessons learned from the Community Forestry Project.\n\n4.\nADB\u2019s midterm review in 1996 confirmed that the project had achieved 70 percent of its\nplanting target. By the end of project implementation, the planted area is expected to reach 150\npercent of the 15,000 hectares target.\n\n5.\nUseful  lessons  can  be  derived  from  the  project  implementation.  For  example,  some\nleases do not extend until the harvest age of trees being grown, and most leases are signed by\nmen, although women play a critical role in woodlot establishment and maintenance. While FD\nhas demonstrated strong  skills  in  meeting  reforestation  targets  through  the  use  of  community\nlabor,  the  gradual  shift  of  allowing  farmers  greater  decision-making  in  woodlot  designs  and\n                                               \n1\n2  Country Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Sri Lanka, December 1997, Asian Development Bank.\n3 \nLoan 1183-SRI: Participatory Forestry Project, for $10.5 million, approved on 5 November 1992.\n\nLoan 568-SRI: Community Forestry Project, for $10 million, approved on 25 March 1982.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nlonger-term  rights over  land  and  products  should  be  encouraged.  Successful  and  sustainable\nsocial  forestry  programs  will  depend  on  the  strengthening  of  community  groups  and  farmer\norganizations to develop their own methods for incorporating trees into farming systems.\n\n3.\n\nUpper Watershed Management Project\n\nThe  ongoing  Upper  Watershed  Management  Project4  commenced  in  1998  to  (i)\n6.\nrehabilitate, sustainably manage, and protect critical watersheds; (ii) improve incomes of project\nbeneficiaries;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  watershed  management  agencies,  including\nFD. The project is currently being implemented and is performing satisfactorily.\n\nB.\n\nOther External Assistance to the Forestry Sector in Sri Lanka\n\n1. \n\nForest Resources Development Project\n\n7.\nThe World Bank and the Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA) invested\n$11.4  million  between  1983  and  1986  for  the  Forest  Resources  Development  Project.  The\nobjectives  were  to  (i)  prepare  a  forest  master  plan  (FMP),  (ii)  conduct  a  forest  inventory  and\nestablish  a  data  base,  and  (iii)  strengthen  FD\u2019s  institutional  capacity.  Although  the  FMP  was\nadopted  in  1990,  it  was  criticized  for  not  being  based  on  adequate  consultation  with\nstakeholders, lacking in conservation orientation, and being too concerned with the production\naspects  of  forestry.  However,  the  FMP  did  provide  a  valuable  data  and  technical  base  to\nprepare subsequent planning in the forestry and forest industries sector. This led to planning of\nthe Forestry Sector Development Project, described next.\n\n2. \n\nForestry Sector Development Project\n\n8.\nThe World Bank, FINNIDA, the United Kingdom\u2019s Overseas Development Administration\n(ODA),  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  invested  $46.4  million\nbetween 1991 and 1996 to help the Government improve the performance of the forest sector in\nline  with  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  economic,  social,  and  environmental  requirements  by  implementing  five\nyears (990-1994) of the FMP. The project objectives were to (i) achieve intensive management\nof  plantations  and  natural  forests,  (ii)  establish  an  environmental  management  system,  (iii)\nexpand the forest resource base by establishing new plantations, (iv) augment professional and\ntechnical  education  and  training  of  farmers,  and  (v)  strengthen  FD\u2019s  institutional  base.  The\nproject  developed  a  forest  sector  master  plan  that  provides  a  long-term  sector  development\nframework from 1995 to 2020,  taking  into  account  lessons  learned  from  the  FMP  and  putting\nmore emphasis on participatory approaches in forestry resource management.\n\n9.\nThe  implementation  completion  report  summarized  the  lessons  learned  as  follows:  (i)\nplantation sites should be clearly identified in order to ensure land is available for plantations; (ii)\nthe  performance  of  FD  was  not  satisfactory,  in  part  due  to  understaffing,  outdated  financial\nregulations,  and  over-centralized  decision-making;  (iii)  realistic  interventions  should  be\nenvisaged  (including  more  private  sector  participation)  as  a  result  of  institutional  capacity\nanalysis; and (iv) any sector reform needs to overcome possible strong resistance from vested\ninterest groups.\n\nThe  World  Bank  expressed  concern  at  the  lack  of  progress  in  addressing  important\n10.\npolicy  issues  such  as  review  of  stumpage  charges  and  restructuring  of  the  State  Timber\n                                               \n4 \n\nLoan 1545-SRI: Upper Watershed Management Project, for $16.6 million, approved on 24 September 1997.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nCorporation (STC). It was recognized that these issues needed to be addressed in future as an\nintegral  part  of  any  investment  projects  in  the  forestry  sector,  to  allow  them  to  yield  positive\nresults.\n\nC.\n\nLessons Learned and their Incorporation in the Project\n\n1.\n\nDeregulation of Forest Related Activities\n\nMany  forest-related  activities,  including  transportation  of  timbers  and  harvesting  of\n11.\nconsiderable  numbers  of  species  grown  on  private  land,  are  currently  subject  to  strict\nregulations.  Deregulation  should  be  promoted  to  enable  the  field-level  FD  staff  to  be  more\nactively involved in forest resource management activities with local communities, rather than in\nlegal enforcement activities.\n\n12.\nThe Government agreed that regulation of timber and wood felling would be phased out\nwith specified time-bound targets. The targets specify the names and numbers of species that\nwill  be  exempt  from  permits  nationwide  at  the  agreed  time.  In  year  three,  the  jak  felling  and\ntransport will be deregulated and the findings of the review used to guide the decision making\nabout possible deregulation of felling jackfruit trees. The Project, at the same time, will support\nthe development of media capacity and campaigns for public awareness  about  the  benefits of\nderegulation and other policy reforms.\n\n2.\n\nDelineation and Demarcation of the State Forests\n\nAmbiguousness  in  the  boundaries  of  state  forests  has  encouraged  encroachment  and\n13.\nillicit harvesting. Clear delineation and demarcation of the forests and appropriate legislation is\nimperative  for  more  efficient  and  effective  enforcement  forest  boundaries  and  to  protect  the\nremaining  natural  forest.  This  is  also  a  prerequisite  for  planning  and  implementing  integrated\nforest resources management.\n\n14.\nA  bill  will  be  introduced  in  the  Parliament  to  amend  or  replace  the  1907  Forest\nOrdinance  and  approve  associated  regulations  with  provisions  for  classification  forests  under\nFD\u2019s  jurisdiction.  The  Project  will  support  the  demarcation  of  legal  boundaries  on  the  ground\nthrough  the  surveying  and demarcation  of  the  forest  in  close  consultation  and  participation  of\nlocal  communities.  A  total  of  17,500  km  of  surveying  and  demarcation  will  be  completed  to\nestablish  a  permanent  forest  area  and  facilitate  integrated  ecosystems  based  forest  resource\nmanagement planning and implementation.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Reforms\n\nTo facilitate  integrated forest  resource  management  at  regional  level,  FD\u2019s  institutional\n15.\ncapacity should be enhanced through organizational restructuring including decentralization and\ndevolution  of  authority  and  redeployment  of  field  level  staff.  The  Government  agreed  to\nestablish four regional Conservators of Forest (CFs), devolve the authority to regional CFs, and\nto divisional, range, and beat forest officers, and rationalize the head office structure in line with\nthe  decentralization.  Range  and  beat  boundaries  will  be  redrawn  to  ensure  appropriate  and\neffective integrated forest resource management.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\n4.\n\nMonopoly of the State Timber Corporation (STC)\n\n16.\nDistortion and inefficiency of markets results from STC\u2019s de facto monopoly. STC enjoys\na monopoly on harvesting and sale of wood from state natural forests and plantations. Because\nSTC  pays  a  very  low  stumpage  fee,  STC  has  not  had  to  become  commercially  oriented  and\ninstitutionally  efficient.  Efforts  to  establish  a  more  fair,  competitive,  and  efficient  market\nenvironment are of particular importance.\n\nThe  Government  will  promote  private  sector  participation  in  all  forestry  operations,\n17.\nincluding harvesting, reforestation, and silviculture of state-owned plantations through an  open\ncompetitive bidding process. To enable STC to adjust to a competitive environment, the annual\nminimum  area  for  harvesting  will  be  allocated  to  STC  for  the  next  three  years.  At  the  end  of\nProject year three, the protection of STC will be independently reviewed.\n\n5.\n\nRights for Land Use\n\nBeneficiaries  of  existing  social  forestry  have  expressed  concerns  about  their  rights  to\n18.\nland-use  because  the  lease  and  management  agreements  are  not  extended  until  the  trees\nreach a harvestable age; and required periodical renewal of targets. New legislative framework\nwill  be  introduced  to  allow  appropriate  leasing/management  contract  arrangements  that\nauthorize FD to enter into partnerships with smallholders and private sector firms for longer term\nmanagement  agreements  for  tree  farms,  woodlots,  and  plantations.  These  contracts  will  be\ncosigned by both spouses (if both are living).\n\n6.\n\nPublic Awareness\n\n19.\nPublic  awareness  is  key  for  promoting  participation  in  forest  resource  management\nactivities  and  for  the  success  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  which  may  attract  resistance\nfrom  vested  interest  groups.  The  Project  will  support  the  development  of  media  capacity  and\nmedia  campaigns  for  public  awareness  about  the  benefits  of  deregulation  and  other  policy\nreforms  by  assisting  the  establishment  of  a  media  center  within  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and\nEnvironment.\n\nD.\n\nADB's Forestry Sector Projects in Other Countries\n\n1. \n\nBangladesh5\n\n20.\nIn Bangladesh, severe population pressure has resulted in continued deforestation and\ndegradation of the country's remaining forestry resources. Bangladesh has received substantial\nexternal  assistance  for  forestry  since  1980.  This  includes  two  ADB  projects  (Community\nForestry Project in 1981 and Upazila [Thana] Afforestation and Nursery Development Project in\n1989)6,  both  of  which  aimed  at  promoting  people-oriented  forest  development.  Given  the\ncontinued  resource  degradation  and  deficits  faced  by  country,  the  Government,  with  ADB\nassistance,  formulated  the  Forestry  Sector  Mater  Plan  (FSMP),  which  provides  an  overall\nstrategy for forest  sector development  through  policy and  institutional  reforms  and  investment\nplans for over 20 years, incorporating a people-oriented forest resource management approach.\n\nLoan 1486-BAN: Forestry Sector Project, for $50 million, approved on 21 November 1996.\n\n                                               \n5\n6     Loan 555-BAN(SF): Community Forestry Project, for $11 million, approved on 3 December 1981 and Loan 956-\n        BAN(SF)  Upazila  Afforestation  and  Nursery  Development  Project, for  43.5  million,  approved  on  30  December\n\n1989.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3, page 5\n\n21.\nADB  approved  the  Forestry  Sector  Project  in  1996.  It  is  the  first  major  intervention  to\npromote forest  resource  management  activities  in  line  with  the  FSMP.  The  Project  adopted  a\nsector approach because of the importance of institutionalizing sustainable forest management\nthrough local community participation, accompanied by institutional capacity building and policy\nreforms. The sector approach was justified by the need to enhance the institutional capacities of\nFD, executing agency of the Project. The scope of the Project includes (i) institutionalization of\ncommunity participation in forest management, thereby increasing overall wood production and\npromoting  forest  conservation,  and  (ii)  enhancement  of  capacity  of  FD  and  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs).\n\n2. \n\nPakistan7\n\n22.\nThe capacity of Pakistan\u2019s forest sector to meet the country's wood demand was being\nseverely reduced by the rapid depletion of forests, largely due to the country's rapid population\ngrowth  (3  percent  a  year).  The  Government  had  implemented  a  number  of  externally  funded\nprojects,  but  they  were  only  partly  successful  in  mitigating  the  high  rate  of  depletion  of  the\nforestry  resources.  With  the  aim  of  developing  long-term  solution  to  the  problem,  the\nGovernment  in  1992  prepared  an  FSMP  with  ADB's  assistance.  The  FSMP  describes  a\ncomprehensive forest sector development strategy.\n\n23.\nADB approved  the  Forestry  Sector  Project  in 1995 as a  first  major  effort  to  implement\nPakistan\u2019s FSMP. The Project was formulated using a sector approach to expand the models of\nbeneficiary in designing, planning, and implementing project-related  activities,  which  had been\ntested under past projects. This approach was to develop an institutional environment and apply\nthese  models  consistently  in  all  forestry  activities  throughout  the  targeted  provinces,  thus\nensuring  the  sustainability  of  forestry  resources.  Community-based  organizations  were\norganized  and  involved  in  the  design  and  execution  of  the  integrated  resource  management\nplans, including participatory village lands-use planning within the subprojects.\n\n24.\nFurther  enhancement  of  institutional  capacity  of  the  Department  of  Forests,  Fisheries,\nand Wildlife (DFFW), the executing agency of the Project, was an important component of the\nProject;  while  DFFW  had  demonstrated  its  capability  to  implement  forest  projects,  several\nactivities were identified to make DFFW to be better prepared to meet the requirements of social\nforestry with its decentralized and community-oriented mandate. Legal reform was also required\nin  the  context  of  the  Project  so  that  the  legal  framework  for  the  forestry  sector  would  be\nconsistent  with  the  Government's  policy,  and  complement  and  provide  an  impetus  to  the  full\ndevelopment of social forestry.\n\n                                               \n7\n\nLoan 1403-PAK: Forestry Sector Project, for $42.6 million, approved on 9 November 1995.\n\n\fPolicy Reforms/Issues\n\nProposed Action\n\nAction by\n\nAction Date\n\nRisks/Constraints\n\nPOLICY REFORM AND IMPLEMENTATION MATRIX\n\n1.

The report is based on information\ngathered  during  the  feasibility  study,  review  of  reports  available  in  the  core  subproject  areas\n(SPAs), and data collected by the project preparation technical assistance team. The three core\nSPAs,  corresponding  to  the  existing  forest  divisions,  were  selected  to  represent  the  various\nclimatic  and  ecological  conditions.  This  report  follows  the  initial  environment  examination\nprocedures developed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and listed in ADB\u2019s Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Agriculture  and  Natural Resources Development Projects,  1991  and\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review, 1993.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\nin \n\n2.\nSelected  core  SPAs  are  in  the  north  central  dry  zone,  the  southwest  and  center  of  the\nlowland wet zone, and the up-country wet and intermediate zones. The objectives of the proposed\nProject  are  to  (i)  assist  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and  Environment    (MFE)  and  the  Forest\nDepartment  (FD) \ntheir  efforts  at  sustainable  development,  effective  protection,  and\ndecentralized management of forest resources by facilitating establishment of a permanent forest\nand  instituting  appropriate  ecosystems-based  integrated  resource  management,  including\nparticipatory  rehabilitation  and  management  of  degraded  natural  forests  and  plantations;  (ii)\nprovide  support  to  people-oriented  forestry  and  private  sector  participation  in  forest  resource\ndevelopment and management; and  (iii)  strengthen the capacity of  MFE  and  FD  as  well  as  the\ncommunity-based organizations, and enhance their institutional effectiveness.\n\n3.\nTo  achieve  the  objectives,  the  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  Five-Year\nImplementation  Plan  in  17  of  the  19  forest  divisions.1  Activities  to  be  supported  include  the\nForestry  Sector  Master  Plan  and  National  Forest  Policy  that  are  directly  linked  to  the  project\nobjectives of integrated ecosystem-based forest resource management.\n\n4.\nThe Project follows a sector approach. The selected SPAs conform to the existing forest\ndivisions,  with  some  of  the  divisions  being  combined  because  of  their  similar  agro-ecological\nfeatures. Other criteria for constituting the SPAs include (i) size, (ii) security, (iii) resource base,\n(iv) willingness of the communities to participate, (v) population pressure, and (vi) environmental\npriority.  Three  core  SPAs  (Anuradhapura  Division,  Badulla  and  Nuwara  Eliya  divisions\n[combined],  and  Ratnapura  Division),  were  selected  for  a  detailed  assessment  during  the\nfeasibility  study  as  they  appropriately  represent  the  nature  and  distribution  of  forests  in  the\ncountry and the entire range of proposed interventions. The additional seven SPAs include the\nremaining secure 13 forest divisions and exclude divisions that are otherwise inaccessible or do\nnot conform to the agreed selection criteria.\n\n5. \nThe  identified  activities  for  each  SPA  include  (i)  agroforestry  woodlots,  (ii)  improved\nmanagement  of  existing  woodlots,  (iii)  improved  management  of  commercial  forests,  (iv)\nrehabilitation and management of degraded plantations, (v) private sector management of state\n\n                                               \n1\n   Because of the lack of access and security concerns in the remaining two divisions of (Ampara and Vavuniya),\n\nonly 17 were included in the Project.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nplantations,  (vi)  enrichment and  management  of  protection  and  other  natural  forests,  and  (vii)\nbuffer zone and encroachment management, including multiple use forestry.\n\n6. \nIn addition  to the investment  interventions,  the  Project  will  support  the  legal  definition  of\nboundaries  through  surveying  (delineation)  and  demarcation  of  the  national  forests.  A  total  of\n13,800 kilometers of surveying and demarcation will be completed to establish a permanent forest\narea  and  facilitate  integrated  ecosystems-based  forest  resource  management  planning  and\nimplementation.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies\nthrough  institutional  reforms,  including  institutional  restructuring  and  streamlining  of  FDs\u2019\nadministrative  systems  to  provide  the  organizational  needs  of  the  wider  sector  policy.  Support\nservices  will  include  capacity  building,  and  public  awareness  and  extension.  The  Project  will\nsupport preparation of an integrated forest resources management plan to develop a participatory\nplanning and operational basis for integrated forest resource management at the divisional level.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\nThe project activities  will be carried  out  in  three  core  SPAs  representing  all  agroclimatic\n7.\nzones of the country: Anuradhapura (dry zone); Badulla and Nuwara Eliya (wet and intermediate\nzones), and Ratnapura (wet zone).\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Resources\n\na.\n\nTopography\n\nMost of the forests in the Ratnapura core SPA have a parallel ridge and valley topography\n8.\nwith an east-west trend. The general elevation of the division ranges from 30 to 2,135 meters (m)\nabove mean sea level. In Badulla-Nuwara Eliya SPA, elevation varies from about 900 to 2,400 m\nand the SPA has a variety of complex of landform features  such  as  mountain  ranges, plateaus,\nplains,  valleys,  and  slopes.  Topographically,  Anuradhapura  core  SPA  belongs  to  the  lowest\npeneplain with gently undulating lands. The average elevation of the area is 178 m.\n\nb.\n\nGeology and Soil\n\n9.\nRatnapura SPA has a highland series of Precambrian rocks that are widely distributed in\nthe northern part of the division. The southern part has two important rock types: a southwestern\ngroup of meta sediments and a highland group of khondalites and charnokites. The predominant\nsoil type in Ratnapura division  is  \"red-yellow podsols  (ultisols).  This  soil type  is found  in steeply\ndissected,  hilly,  and  rolling  terrain  and  is  developed  on  a  wide  variety  of  parent  materials.  In\nmountainous areas, red-yellow podsolic soils and mountain regosols are found.\n\nBadulla-Nuwara  Eliya  SPA  belongs  to  the  highland  series  of  the  Precambrian  complex.\n10.\nThe major rock types are quartzites, marble, and granites. The dominant types of soil include red-\nyellow podsols, reddish-brown latosols, and immature brown loams and regosols. The red-yellow\npodsolic soils are  widely  distributed throughout  Nuwara Eliya.  Anuradhapura division belongs to\nthe highland  series of Sri Lanka, and  its underlying  rocks are  charnokite, quartzite, and  marble.\nThe soil in the dry zone is classified as an alfisol, which broadly corresponds to the reddish-brown\nearths.  Chemically, this  soil  type is  considered moderately  rich soil but  poor  in  phosphorus  and\nnitrogen.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nc.\n\nClimate\n\n11.\nRatnapura SPA  receives between 3,810 and 5,080 millimeters (mm) of  rainfall  annually,\naveraging  more  than  3,000  mm,  and  has  no  dry  season.  The  highest  rainfall  and  the  lowest\ntemperature  are  recorded  in  Nuwara  Eliya.  Watawala  receives  the  highest  annual  rainfall,\nexceeding  5,588  mm.  Nuwara  Eliya  experiences  the  lowest  monthly  average  temperature  of\nabout 7.2\u00baC, and the temperature occasionally falls below freezing. The average annual rainfall in\nBadulla  is  around  2,000  mm.  The  average  annual  temperature  of  the  division  varies  between\n20.0\u00baC and 25.0\u00baC depending on the altitude. Anuradhapura\u2019s dry zone has an annual rainfall of\n1,329 mm and mean annual temperature of 27.3\u00baC.\n\n2.\n\nEcological Resources\n\na.\n\nForest Cover\n\n12.\nThe latest forest inventory (1992) showed dense natural forest cover in 24 percent of Sri\nLanka\u2019s  land  area,  and  7  percent  of  the  land  covered  with  sparse,  open  forests.  The  FD  and\nDepartment of Wildlife Conservation control the natural forests.\n\n13.\nNearly  14  percent  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  land  area  is  protected  area.  All  categories  of  reserves\nmanaged by the Department of Wildlife Conservation are regarded as protected areas. The man\nand biosphere reserves, protection and conservation forests (30), Sinharaja World Heritage Site,\nand  Knuckles  and  Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya  forest  reserves  managed  by  FD  are\nconsidered to be protected areas.\n\n14.\nForest  resources  in  Ratnapura  SPA  include  a  large  number  of  high-value  forest\nreserves\u201449,038 hectares (ha) of proposed forest reserves and forest reserves. Badulla-Nuwara\nEliya SPA has the smallest area of natural forests (38,392 ha of proposed and existing reserves)\nof the three core SPAs, and Anuradhapura, the largest (180,776 ha). However, the forest reserve\narea in the north and eastern portion of the division is not accessible at this time due to terrorist\nactivities.\n\nb.\n\nForest Formations\n\n15.\nVegetation  in  Ratnapura  SPA  can  be  classified  as  lowland  rain  forest,  submontane  and\nupper  montane  rain  forest,  wet  patana  grassland,  and  tree  savanna.  The  dominant  vegetation\ntype is lowland rain forest. The lowland wet zone forests in Ratnapura SPA are classified as Wet\nEvergreen Forest Climax, Wet Tropical Evergreen Forest, Toona-Dipterocarpus-Mesua series.\n\n16.\nThe  vegetation  of  the  submontane  area  in  Ratnapura  is  described  as  the  Toona-\nCalophyllum-Syzygium  series.  The  forests  of  this  series  are  shorter  than  lowland  evergreen\nforests; lack huge large buttressing roots; and have a large number of species descending from\nupper altitudes, in particular the family Lauraceae.\n\nNatural  vegetation  in Badulla-Nuwara  Eliya SPA  includes  submontane  rain  forest,  upper\n17.\nmontane rain forest, tree savanna, and dry patana grassland. The vegetation of the submontane\nforest  is described as the Toona-Calophyllum-Syzygium series. Physiognomically, the forests of\nthis series are shorter than the lowland evergreen forests; lack large buttressing roots; and have a\nlarge number of species descending from upper altitudes, in particular the family Lauraceae. The\nupper montane rain forests in the core SPA replace the lower montane rain forests above 1,500\nm.  The upper  montane rain forests are  rich  in  epiphytes, orchids,  mosses,  and  filmy  ferns.  The\ntrees are stunted, with umbrella-shaped crowns and twisted branches. The forest is single-storied.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nUnderstory vegetation is sparse due to lack of sunlight, which cannot penetrate through the dense\ncanopy.\n\n18.\nNatural  vegetation  in  Anuradhapura  core  SPA  includes  dry-mixed  evergreen  forest\n(synonyms:  monsoon  forest,  seasonal  forest,  and  moist  deciduous  forest);  scrublands;  riverine\nforest; villu grassland;  and tree-savanna.  The dominant forest  is dry-mixed evergreen of shorter\nstature  and  with  less  biomass  than  lowland  rain  forest.  It  is  also  deciduous  to  a  considerable\ndegree.  Dry  mixed  evergreen  is  the  most  widespread  forest  formation  in  Sri  Lanka  and  is  very\ncharacteristic of the lowland dry zone below 600 m.\n\nc.\n\nBiodiversity\n\nThe southwestern part of Sri Lanka (Galle, Kalutara, Matara, and Ratnapura) is one of the\n19.\n18 \u201chot spots\u201d of the world because of the high number of endemic plant species. Among the flora\n(3,600 flowering plants), as much as 23 percent of plant species are endemic to Sri Lanka, and 94\npercent  of  the  endemics  are  confined  to  the  forests  in  low  and  upcountry  wet  zones.  Eighteen\npercent of the ferns and 16 percent of the terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to the country, and\nmost of them are contained in natural forests of the wet zone. Closed canopy natural forest covers\naround 10 percent of the wet zone land area and occurs in blocks scattered throughout the area.\nSri Lanka has 426 threatened flowering plants.  The 1997  National  Conservation  Review  survey\nrecorded 216 species of threatened flowering plants in the wet zone forests.\n\n20.\nThe fauna exhibits a similar pattern of endemicity and distribution. The number of species\nand the percentage of endemic species in some faunal groups are as follows: fish, 59 (of which 27\npercent  are  endemic);  amphibians,  37  (51  percent);  reptiles,  139  (50  percent);  birds,  237  (8\npercent);  and  mammals,  85  (14  percent).  The  vast  majority  of  endemic  species,  particularly\namong fish, amphibians, and reptiles, are confined to the wet zone forests.\n\n3.\n\nHuman and Economic Development\n\n21.\nAccording  to the demographic  survey of Sri Lanka  in 1994,  the  population  in  Ratnapura\nDivision was 917,349. The  rate of population growth in  Ratnapura  was estimated  to be about 1\npercent  annually  from  1990  to  1994.  In  Anuradhapura,  the  total  population  in  1994  is  676,197.\nFarmers in the dry zone have few economic alternatives to farming. Most households engage in\nshifting cultivation on state land, which supplies about 30 percent of household income. Women\nand children provide most of the labor for cultivation while men attend to rice paddies, either their\nown or as  wage  laborers.  Landless  households  (those  with  only  sufficient  land  for  a  home  and\nsmall  garden,  generally  less  than  0.1  ha)  are  potential  participants  in  smallholder  forest\nmanagement in the dry zone.\n\nAnuradhapura  has  the  lowest  average  household  income  in  Sri  Lanka  (SLRs2,600  per\n22.\nhousehold versus SLRs3,540 nationwide). In recent surveys (1997), 45 percent of children under\nthe age of five were malnourished, with 26 percent stunted. Because of the displacement by the\nethnic  conflict  in  the  north  and  east  of  the  country  and  dependence  on  farming  in  an  area  of\nseasonal and varied rainfall, the populations are vulnerable to starvation and malnutrition.\n\n23.\nThe population of Badulla and Nuwara Eliya is 749,549 and 671,344, respectively, based\non the 1994 demographic survey. Of the population, 56 percent  live  in  the  rural  villages and 38\npercent on the estate plantations. The Tamils, who live mostly on the estate plantations in Nuwara\nEliya, comprise 44 percent of the population. Outside the estate plantations, the great majority of\nthe population are Sinhalese.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nThe  highland  areas  dominated  by  the  tea  estates  are  populated  by  Indian  Tamil  estate\n24.\nworkers. The primary earners (with low wages) in the family are women who are employed as tea\npickers from 10 to 12  months a year.   Men are barely  able to find  work for three months in the\nyear.  As  an  alternative,  they  turn  to  encroachment  on  state  lands  for  vegetable  and  potato\nproduction.\n\n25.\nThe middle hill areas are predominately occupied by Sinhalese. Men are the primary wage\nearners in agriculture and marketing.  Women tend home gardens, process saleable foods, and\nengage in handicrafts. The 1990/1991 Household Income and Expenditure Survey in Badulla and\nNuwara Eliya shows earnings are 80 to 84 percent less than the national average.2 The incidence\nof poverty was 36.8 percent in Badulla and 22.6 percent in Nuwara Eliya. Nationally, the average\nis 30.4 percent.\n\n4.\n\nQuality of Life Values\n\n26.\nThe  percentage  of  poverty  is  highest  in  the  rural  areas  (35  percent),  and  lowest  in  the\nurban areas (18 percent). Malnutrition is widespread, especially among children and mothers. The\n1993  and  1994  Sri  Lanka  Food  Balance  Sheets  show  low  average  availability  of  calories  per\ncapita  from  all  food  sources  against  a  recommended  minimum  of  2,100  calories  per  day.  The\ninfant mortality rate (up to age one) is 16 per thousand births. Of the 17 divisions where project\nactivities  are  being  carried  out,  6  are  considered  educationally  disadvantaged  divisions:3\nAnuradhapura, Badulla and Nuwara Eliya, Hambantota, Monaragala, and Polonnaruwa.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Mitigation Measures\n\na.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Project Location\n\n27.\nThe Project  will  support the  survey  and  demarcation  of  permanent  forest  estates,  which\nincludes  surveying  the  boundaries  of  forest  reserves,  proposed  forest  reserves,  and  FD\nplantations.  The  establishment  of  forest  reserve  boundaries  using  a  participatory  approach  will\ncreate awareness of the importance of reserves and discourage further encroachments. This will\nimprove the biodiversity and soil and water conservation in all protection and conservation forests\nidentified by  National Conservation  Review  in the  wet  zone.  Management  of  the  protection  and\nconservation forests will restrict encroachment for tea cultivation. Development of buffer zones in\nprotection and conservation forests and other forest reserves will benefit communities with limited\naccess to forests.\n\n28.\nSelection of land for farmer woodlots in the dry zone may cause  land-use  conflicts  if not\ndone through a participatory process. The area of land for grazing and food production could be\nreduced.  The  development  of  agroforestry  and  plantations  may  cause  significant  social  and\nenvironmental  impacts  if the  locations are not properly  selected.  The  use  of  FD  land  for  farmer\nwoodlots under the participatory forestry program will raise the issue of short- or long-term tenure\nagreements  and  usufruct  rights.  Effective  participation  of  people  depends  on  their  rights  to  the\nplanted trees and tenure for at least one rotation. The commercial plantation management activity\nwill also have a positive impact on the environment. Proper care, however, will be needed in the\nselection of sites with high productive potential and accessibility.\n\n                                               \n2  The 1990 national average was SLRs3,549 per month.\n3\n\nEconomic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka, 1998. Central Bank of Sri Lanka.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\nb.\n\nPotential Environmental Impacts due to Harvesting\nand Reforestation\n\nAgroforestry plots for production of wood and agricultural crops near settlements facilitate\n29.\nfelling  and\nfarmers\u2019  access \nencroachments). Increasing tree cover can increase soil fertility by improving moisture  retention,\nsoil structure, and nutrient content. Incorporating trees into agricultural systems can improve crop\nyields by improving soil and the microclimate.\n\nthese  goods  and  reduce  pressure  on \n\nforests  (illegal \n\nto \n\n30.\nThe  establishment  of  large  commercial  plantations  may  cause  adverse  environmental\nimpacts during  site  preparation.  The  impacts may  include  accelerated  erosion,  disruption  of  the\nhydrologic cycle, compaction of soil, loss of nutrients, and a decline in soil fertility. Many of these\nimpacts can be short-term until the vegetation cover is reestablished by replanting. The severity of\nthe impacts depends in large part on site conditions prior to planting, site preparation techniques,\nspecies  to  be  planted,  treatments  during  rotation,  length  of  rotation,  and  harvesting  methods.\nReforestation  in dry areas  can deplete soil  moisture and lower  the  water  table. Soil  compaction\nand  damage  can  occur  during  the  harvest  season  and  site  preparation.  Erosion  can  occur  in\nplantations  with  incomplete  canopy  closure  or  limited  undergrowth.  Accumulation  of  leaf  litter\nunder plantations increases the risk of fire and decreases  rainwater  infiltration.  In  monocultures,\ntree leaf litter may change the chemical and biological characteristics of the soil.\n\nc.\n\nPotential Environmental Impacts Associated with Project Design\n\n31.\nDry  zone  reserves  under  the  Project  will  be  managed  through  participatory  land-use\nplanning  in  communities  within  and  surrounding  the  reserve.  The  lands  will  be  identified  for\nmultiple uses such as forest protection, grazing, and agroforestry woodlots (AFWs). Priority will be\ngiven to individuals and communities within or in the periphery of the six reserves. AFW models\nwill need to be properly established to suit selected sites  in the dry zone  and  fulfill  the  farmers\u2019\nneeds to avoid potential adverse environmental impacts. Evaluation of existing AFW models and\ndesign  and  testing  of  new  models  in  the  dry  zone  can  provide  lessons  on  how  to  minimize\npotential  adverse  impacts.  At  present,  people  collect  poles  and  fuelwood  from  abandoned\nswiddens, degraded forests, and scrublands. It may be important to survey the demand for poles\nand fuelwood before establishing plots in an area.\n\nd.\n\nPotential Environmental Impacts from Construction\n\nThe civil works under this Project will include (i) the construction of (a) three units of 150\n32.\nsquare  meters  (m2)  for  regional  offices  in  Anuradhapura;  (b)  quarters  for  the  divisional  forest\nofficers in Matara, Nuwara Eliya, and Ratnapura; (c) three offices (one at the range forest officer\nlevel  and  two  at  the  beat  forest  officer  level);  and  (d)  an  auditorium  (400  m2)  at  the  Sri  Lanka\nForestry  Institute,  Nuwara  Eliya;  and  (ii)  improvement  of  the  access  road  to  Sinharaja  forest\nreserve to enhance protection and facilitate ecotourism. Construction activities will generate noise\nand dust that could be significant when close to a populated area. Therefore, selection of sites will\nbe important consideration to mitigate the impacts. Access roads for harvesting and reforestation\nof  commercial  forest  plantations  in  the  upcountry  wet  and  dry  zones  should  be  designed  to\nminimize soil erosion during rainy season.\n\n33.\nImprovement of the access road to Sinharaja forest reserve will result in better protection\nof the resource, as it will facilitate inspections by senior FD officers. To avoid potential adverse\nimpacts  from  excessive  numbers  of  visitors,  FD  will  regulate  the  number  through  a  permit\nsystem  that  will  be  monitored  closely.  Potential  impacts  of  erosion  resulting  from  road\nimprovement works can be avoided by ensuring adequate and well designed drainage along the\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\nroad. Given the high rainfall in the area, the side and cross drainage will have to be constructed\nin concrete to safeguard the environment and enhance longevity of the improved road.\n\ne.\n\nPotential Environmental Impacts from Project Operations\n\n34.\nNo  major  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  during  the  project  operational\nphase.  The  socioeconomic  impacts  of  social  forestry  interventions  will  be  monitored  regularly.\nHarvesting and reforestation of teak and eucalyptus plantations will have several adverse impacts.\nThe major impact due to harvesting and reforestation of eucalyptus plantations  in the upcountry\nwet zone (Nuwara Eliya) is soil erosion. These impacts can be avoided by  adopting appropriate\nand environmentally sound harvesting and reforestation techniques.\n\n2.\n\nPlantation Development and Mitigation Measures\n\na.\n\nEnvironmental Enhancement and Proposed Mitigation Measures\n\nDemarcation  and  marking  of  forest  reserve  boundaries  in  the  wet  zone,  using  concrete\n35.\nposts  and  participatory  forest  management,  are  expected  to  minimize  the  encroachment  into\nforest. Protection forestry interventions will increase awareness among villagers in buffer zones of\ntargeted protection and conservation forests.\n\n36.\nSupport services, training of MFE and FD field and head office staff, and reorganization of\nFD  into  a  more  responsive  and  effective  structure  will  increase  the  performance  of  the  forest\nsector.  Deregulation  of  cutting  and  transport  permits  for  timber  and  timber-based  products  will\nreduce transaction and compliance costs that currently impede and distort productive investment\nin the sector.\n\n37.\nA  workshop  with  farmers  in  the  targeted  area  generated  proposals  for  new  woodlot\nmodels.  These  are  (i)  an  agroforestry  model  with  low-density  timber  trees  at  280  trees  per\nhectare, which would retain 50 percent growing space for annual crops and would allow farmers\nto plant about 20 fruit trees per hectare; and (ii) an agroforestry model designed to produce poles\nand crops.\n\nb.\n\nMitigation Measures for Harvesting and Reforestation Impacts\n\n38.\nEnvironmental impacts of harvesting and reforestation could be mitigated using low-impact\nlogging  techniques  and  reforestation  with  species  matched  to  site  characteristics  on  an\nappropriate time schedule. Project interventions  will improve  forest  protection  and  conservation,\nforest management, and forest plantation management.\n\nSoil  erosion  is  the  anticipated  negative  environmental  impact  of  harvesting  and\n39.\nreforestation  of  eucalyptus  plantations  in  the  upcountry  wet  zone  is  soil  erosion.  This  can  be\nmitigated  in  several  ways:  (i)  replanting  as  soon  as  possible  after  cutting  of  trees,  (ii)  avoiding\nclear-cutting of large areas, (iii) limiting harvest to seasons of low rainfall, (iv) planning of felling to\nminimize  log  skidding  and  avoiding  skidding  logs  parallel  to  the  slope,  (v)  stabilizing  skid  trails\nafter  use,  and  (vi)  using  animals  or  cable  logging  systems  instead  of  skidders  for  extraction.\nKeeping  branches  and  other  debris  on  the  ground  can  mitigate  the  loss  of  nutrients  from  the\nharvested area. Planting cover crops and adding fertilizer to compensate for nutrient loss is also\nrecommended.\n\n40.\nIt is extremely important to monitor the harvesting and reforestation of teak and eucalyptus\nplantations  to  ensure  that  loggers  and  harvesters  adhere  to  the  contracts  designed  in  the\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 9, page 8\n\nmanagement  plan  for  each  plantation,  to  minimize  environmental  impacts.  Frequency  of\nmonitoring  depends  on  site  conditions  and  the  extent  of  the  plantation.  A  trained  forester  will\nmonitor actual harvesting at least weekly.\n\nc.\n\nOverall Environmental Benefits\n\n41.\nThe  main  benefits  expected  from  the  protection  forestry  interventions  and  public\nawareness  and  extension  services  in  the  wet  zone  are  (i)  biodiversity,  and  soil  and  water\nconservation  in  southwest  Sri  Lanka  (being  a  concentration  area  of  species  with  exceptional\nlevels of endemism and over 95 percent of the country\u2019s threatened plant and animal species); (ii)\nglobal importance (for conserving the world\u2019s floristic diversity in the biodiversity problem area of\nsouthwest Sri Lanka); (iii) awareness among peripheral communities and the general public of the\nneed  for  protection  and  conservation  forests;  and  (iv)  publication  of  information  relevant  to\nconservation and biodiversity.\n\n42.\nThe  sustainable  management  of  dry  zone  forest  reserves  under  the  social  forestry\ninterventions  will  increase  the  benefit  to  surrounding  communities.  Land  leased  for  AFWs  will\nprovide continuing income to farmers and discourage shifting cultivation. Improved management\nof existing woodlots will provide incentives for continued smallholder management.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n43.\nMFE will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate and supervise policy and planning\nreforms.  Implementation  of  field  and  technical  activities  will  be  conducted  through  FD.  An\nappropriately  qualified  project  administrator  at  MFE  will  be  appointed  by  the  Government  for\neffective implementation of the Project.\n\n44.\nA  project  management unit  (PMU)  will  be  constituted at  the  national  level.  The  project\ndirector  will  head  the  PMU,  and  four  conservators  of  forests  will  be  members.  The  NPIU  will\nassist the national project director by providing necessary technical and administrative support\nto the conservators of forests in the field, to ensure effective and timely project implementation.\nThe  national  project  director,  with  assistance  of  the  PMU,  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall\ncoordination and planning of project inputs, outputs, and activities, including (i) coordination with\nthe  project  administrator  at  MFE,  and  with  other  projects  and  programs  in  the  sector;  (ii)\npreparation  of  feasibility  study  reports  for  the  additional  subprojects  and  their  submission  to\nADB through the project administrator; (iii) assistance to the project administrator in drawing up\nspecifications  and  tender  documents  for  centralized  procurement  of  all  materials,  equipment,\nand  vehicles  required  by  the  Project  as  well  as  for  the  survey,  delineation,  demarcation,  and\nmapping  contracts;  (iv)  maintenance  and  submission  of  project  accounts  to  the  project\nadministrator  for  onward  submission  to  ADB;  (vi)  drafting  and  approval  of  contracts  within  its\nauthority  and  submission  of  contracts  not  within  its  authority  for  approval  to  appropriate\nauthorities;  (v)  review,  compilation,  and  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  and  other\ndocuments  to  the  project  administrator  for  reimbursement  by  ADB;  (vii)  engagement  of\nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  the\nGovernment  procedures;  (viii)  selection  of  participants  for  in-country  and  overseas  training  in\nconsultation  with  relevant  agencies;  and  (ix)  preparation  of  quarterly  and  annual  reports  for\nsubmission to ADB and the appropriate Government agencies through the project administrator.\nThe government will ensure that the project administrator and national project director have the\nassistance of administrative and other support staff to ensure efficient and effective delivery of\ntheir responsibilities.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 9, page 9\n\nTo  facilitate  national  level  coordination  with  various  agencies  and  institutions  and\n45.\nmaintain  transparency,  a  project  steering  committee  will  be  set  up  at  the  national  level  within\ntwo months of loan effectiveness.\n\nAt  the  forest  division  level,  coordination  will  be  provided  by  a  divisional  coordination\n46.\ncommittee  headed  by  the  divisional  secretary,  with  the  division  forest  officer  as  the  member\nsecretary  and  representatives  of  the  concerned  departments  and  agencies  as  members.  The\ndivisional  coordination  committee  will  meet  quarterly  each  year  to  discuss  the  progress  of\nproject implementation, identify and address constraints, resolve conflicts, and ensure that there\nis no duplication or overlap in project activities.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n 47.\nComprehensive  periodic  reviews  and  detailed  evaluation  of  the  Project  will  be\nundertaken jointly by ADB, MFE, and FD in the third year (linked to completion of the feasibility\nstudies for additional SPAs) and the sixth year of implementation.\n \n48.\nUsing FD\u2019s available biodiversity baseline data, the sixth year evaluation will include the\nimpact of project interventions on biodiversity in the natural forests. This evaluation will require\nsample measurements of the permanent sample plots established by FD in the natural forests\nwithin  the  SPAs.  This  activity  will  be  carried  out  in  collaboration  with  ADB\u2019s  Protected  Area\nManagement and Wildlife  Conservation Project.  The  Project  will  support the  dry  zone farmers\nby leasing state lands for social forestry activities and including them in a participatory process\nto manage forest reserves in Anuradhapura.\n\n49.\nThe Project is designed in harmony with the environmental conditions of the core SPAs\nand  is  to  be  undertaken  through  participatory  and  bottom-up  planning  approaches.  The\nenvironmental  impact  screening  has  not  identified  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts\nexcept under the commercial forest management.\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\nCommercial  plantation  activities  provide  increased  revenue  to  the  Government,  private\n50.\nsector  involvement  in  plantation  activities,  and  a  continuous  supply  of  wood  from  plantations.\nAgroforestry  woodlot  activities  will  reduce  the  area  under  shifting  cultivation  and  provide\npermanent  supplementary  income  to  farmers.  Improvements  to  existing  farmer  woodlots  will\nincrease  the  quality  and  quantity  of  wood  coming  to  the  market.  The  project  interventions  will\nimprove \nthe  protection,  conservation,  and  management  of  high-priority  protection  and\nconservation forests by reducing or halting the encroachments and illegal felling of timber.  It will\nalso  increase  the  awareness  of  conservation  among  peripheral  communities  and  the  general\npublic. If the Project is not implemented, the degradation of resources in these forest reserves will\ncontinue. The proposed restructuring of FD will allow efficient management of forest resources in\nthe country.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\n1.\nThe  forest  in  Sri  Lanka  is  being  seriously  depleted  through  overexploitation  by\ncommercial  interests  and  traditional  users,  and  through  inadequate  management  by  the\nForest  Department  (FD).  Most  of  the  forest\u2019s  users  are  seriously  disadvantaged  by  their\npoverty, lack of organization and information, lack of secured access to productive resources\nsuch land and tress, lack of capital, and low levels of effective access to social services and\ninfrastructure. They have little direct access to markets, and are not organized to voice their\nviews  regarding  the  state  of  the  forest  or  its  management.  While  there  are  some\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  are\nworking  among  the  forest  communities,  their  programs  show  lack  of  focus  on  sustainable\nmanagement of the forest  resources. Without dialogue and effective  working arrangements\nbetween FD as the legal custodian of the forest and the forest-dependent communities who\nare  mostly  poor,  the  current  alarming  trends  will  surely  continue.  Thus,  participatory\nmanagement  strategies  fully  involving  all  stakeholders  will  need  to  be  developed  and\nimplemented.\n\n2.\nSocial  development  concerns  such  as  gender,  poverty,  and  participation  was\nincorporated into all stages of project preparation. Poverty, gender, and participation issues\nwere basic to approaches used in socioeconomic and forest community data collection. The\nthree  core  subproject  areas  (Anuradhapura,  Badulla-Nuwara  Eliya  and  Ratnapura)  were\nstudied in detail. The social and economic issues were reflected in the selection and design\nof the agroforestry and woodlot programs, land lease arrangements, land-use planning and\nboundary survey.\n\nA. \n\nSocioeconomic Profile of the Forest Communities in the Project Areas\n\n3.\nAnuradhapura  District  has  the  lowest  average  household  income  in  the  country\n(SLRs2,600 per household per month compared to SLRs3,540 nationwide). Indicators of well\nbeing  show  the  rural  dry  zone  population  to  be  vulnerable.  In  recent  surveys  (1997)  45\npercent of children under the age of five were malnourished with 26 percent of them stunted.\nDisplacement  by  the  ethnic  conflict  in  the  north  and  east  of  the  country  as  well  as  the\ndependence  on  farming  in  an  area  of  seasonal  and  varied  rainfall  has  created  vulnerable\npopulations. Although  land  is  relatively  abundant  with  only  83  people  per  square  kilometer\n(km2),  parcels  of  irrigated  land  are  small.  In  areas  with  no  irrigation,  where  agriculture  is\nhighly  unreliable  most  households  depend  on  seasonal  wage  labor.  The  majority  of  the\ntargeted beneficiaries of social forestry interventions engage in shifting cultivation; about two\nthirds have irrigated rice fields. The incidence of poverty is high. Of households sampled by\nthe project preparatory technical assistance team, 38 percent were at or below poverty  line\nwhile  most  farmers  were  just  above  the  poverty  line.  The  farmer  households  are  highly\nvulnerable  to  income  fluctuations  and  weather,  and  thus  70  percent  of  them  depend  on\nSamurdhi welfare benefits. Most households have encroached on lands, but hesitant to put a\nlong-term  investment  in  them  for  productive  purposes.  Approximately  2,500  marginal  and\nlandless farm households will receive long-term leases to FD land for agroforestry plots and\nfarmer woodlots (2,500 ha) in Anuradhapura. Cost sharing will be provided for establishing of\nthe  tree  portion  of  the  leased  plots,  which  also  permits  annual  cropping.  The  provision  of\nsupplemental  income  from  the  wood  portion  of  these  plots  helps  to  reduce  household\u2019s\nvulnerability during years of poor rainfall. Greater participation of the community in land use\nplanning and decisions regarding forest reserve land use provides opportunities to invest in\nimproved grazing and other resources that can provide sources of income not dependent on\nrainfall. Improved management of existing woodlots will target more than 2,000 participatory\nproject farmers who have planted teak.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nPopulation density in Nuwara Eliya was 354 per km2  in 1981. Over 70 percent of the\n4.\nNuwara  Eliya  population  and  over  80  percent  of  the  Badulla  population  are  engaged  in\nagriculture,  fisheries,  or  forestry.  Population  pressure  in  highland  areas  has  led  to\nencroachment  on  forest  reserves  for  vegetable  cultivation.  The  area  under  highland  tea  is\ndeclining  as  eroded  land  is  moved  out  of  tea  production  and  new  planting  takes  place  for\nlowland tea. Improved management of commercial plantations will target planting 1,155 ha of\neucalyptus and rehabilitating and managing an additional 1,381 ha of degraded plantations.\nSocial  forestry  interventions  are  limited  to  improvement  of  existing  farmer  woodlots  and\nforest reserve buffer zone development in areas of high priority. Because of land scarcity and\nthe  need  to  protect  existing  forest  reserves,  FD  can  not  reserve  land  for  agroforestry  or\nfarmer woodlots. The project will benefit a total of 2,749 woodlot farmers through training and\nmarketing activities.\n\nThe population density in Ratnapura is 700 people/km2. Due to population pressure,\n5.\nthe area under forest cover has been declining and with much of the remaining forest occurs\nin  isolated  fragments.  The  region  is  highly  integrated  into  a  cash  crop  economy  with  tea,\nrubber,  cinnamon,  and  coconut  as  principal  cash  crops.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  project  in\nthis  area  live  in  the  periphery  of  the  forest  reserves.  Most  of  them  cultivate  tea  and  other\ncash crops,  such as  rubber and  cinnamon.  Although  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  low,  there\nare pockets of poverty where 13 percent of the population are at or  below  the  poverty  line.\nMost  residents,  regardless  of  income  levels,  have  encroached  on  lands.  The  high  labor\ndemand  for  tea  cultivation  and  steady  income  derived  from  tea  sales  has  reduced  rural\nhousehold dependency on forest product sales. However, many rural households continue to\nharvest forest products, especially fuelwood and timber, for home consumption.\n\nB. \n\nGender and NGOs/CBOs Participation\n\nIn  the  dry  zone, households headed  by  women have fewer  wage  labor options  and\n6.\nare paid lower wages. Much of women\u2019s income comes from agricultural activities. Training\nfor agroforestry plots, which seeks to stabilize shifting cultivation, will be targeted to women\nfarmers.  The  Project  will  ensure  equal  opportunity  for  women  and  men  to  sign/cosign  the\nland  tenure  leases.  The  participation  of  NGOs  and  CBOs  in  the  project  preparation  and\nimplementation will enhance the effectiveness of project intervention to reduce poverty.\n\nC. \n\nSocial and Economic Benefits as Perceived by the Project Beneficiaries\n\n7.\nTo  see  the  possible  benefits  of  the  project  to  the  poor,  the  staff  consultant  during\nappraisal investigated the beneficiaries of the 1998 social forestry project  initiated by  FD  in\nMaha Hamillawa, Kahatagasdilliya in Anuradhapura District.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  recent\nsocial forestry project perceived the following short-term (immediate) and long-term benefits\nthrough the project (tables A10.1 and A10.2).\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\n1. \n\nTable A10.1: Economic Benefits as Perceived by the Project Beneficiaries\n\nShort-Term (Immediate) Benefits\n\u2022  The  land  (.4  hectare)  received  for  teak\ncultivation  for  25  years  under  a  lease\nagreement with the FD.\n\n\u2022  Supplementary \n\nincome \n\ngenerated\nthrough  intercropping  of  maize,  chilies,\ngreen  gram,  sesame,  etc.  done  in  the\nteak plantation itself.\n\n\u2022  The  incentive  payment  will  provide  a\nsupplementary income to the family.\n\u2022  The incentive payment provides a sense\nof security to the beneficiary  households\nin times of difficulty, even when they are\nunable to engage in shifting cultivation.\n\n\u2022  The incentive vouchers received  in  lump\nsum  enabled  some  families  to  acquire\nfor\nmaterial  assets,  e.g., \nroofs,  bicycles,  cement \nfor  house\nconstruction, etc.\n\ntiles/sheets \n\n\u2022  Additional \n\nincome  generated \n\nthrough\n\nplant nurseries.\n\nLong-Term Benefits\n\u2022  Cash  income  to  be  received  after  7  and\nthen  15  years  when  undergrown  trees  are\nuprooted (thinning-out).\n\n\u2022  Cash income to be received after  25  years\n\nwhen trees are harvested.\n\n\u2022  Timber \n\nfor  house  construction/repairs,\nfuelwood and furniture for the house can be\nobtained  from  her/his  own  land  and  not\nnecessary  to  depend  on  the  forest  or  the\nmarket to find them.\n\n\u2022  Teak plantation is an economic asset to be\n\n\u2022 \n\ninherited by future registrations.\nIt provides a sense of economic security to\nthe  beneficiary  households  especially  in\ntheir old age.\n\n\u2022  Employment opportunities for youth such as\n\ncarpentry to produce furniture, etc.\n\n2. \n\nTable  A10.2:  Social  and  Environmental  Benefits  as  Perceived  by  Project\nBeneficiaries\n\nShort-Term (Immediate) Benefits\n\u2022  The  technical  know-how  transferred  to\nthe  beneficiaries  particularly  on \nthe\nestablishment  and  management  of  plant\nnurseries.\n\n\u2022  Strengthened  social  relationships  as  a\nresult of beneficiaries working as a group.\n\n\u2022  The  emergence  of  an  organization  like\nEnvironment  Protection  and  Farmers\u2019\nForestry Society) to manage the affairs of\nthe forestry project.\n\n\u2022  Ability \n\nto  participate \n\nthe  decision\nmaking process for women and men with\nregard to project implementation.\n\nin \n\n\u2022  Awareness  created  among  the  villagers\non the need for forest conservation.\n\u2022  The  demonstration-effect  of  the  project\nwhere  with  their  own  initiative,  villagers\nset aside 4.8 hectares of land.\n\nLong-Term Benefits\n\u2022  Prevention  of  forest  destruction  and  its\n\nconservation.\n\n\u2022  Prevents village land turning into a desert.\n\u2022  Protection and re-generation of wildlife.\n\u2022  A  transformation  of  the  existing  social\nstructure  in  the  village  where  the  poor  will\nbe able to improve their condition.\nof \n\nthe\nthe \ngovernment\u2019s  welfare  subsidies  will  be\nsignificantly reduced.\n\n\u2022  Dependency \n\npoor  on \n\n\u2022  Enhancement  of  the  self-esteem  through\nownership  and  control  of  valuable  asset\nsuch as land.\n\n\u2022  Damages  caused  to  the  forest  reservation\ndue  to  uncontrolled  timber  felling  will  be\nreduced.\n\n\u2022  Dependency  on  the  forest  for  livelihoods\nwill be reduced with the new incomes.\n\u2022  The  new  generation  will  learn  to  love\n\nnature.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  focuses  on  the  three  core  subprojects,  which  are\nassumed to represent the range of physical conditions that prevail in the project areas and affect\ndevelopment  and/or  rehabilitation  of  natural  forests  and  plantations.  Specific  field  interventions\nwere identified for implementation at each core subproject area (SPA) and were deemed replicable\nin the agro-ecological zones of the sector project. The results of the economic analyses of the core\nsubprojects  are  deemed  sufficient  to  reflect  the  likely  range  of  returns  for  the  whole  project\nincluding  the  SPAs.  The  economic  analysis  makes  the  following  assumptions  with  respect  to\nforeign exchange rate, opportunity cost of labor, subproject costs, subproject benefits, and period\nof analysis.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nEconomic Prices: Economic border prices (world price) are used in the economic\nanalysis.  Costs  and  benefits  were  broken  into  traded,  nontraded,  labor,  and  tax\nfactors and converted to world prices. For nontradables, a standard version factor of\n0.9 was applied to derive economic prices, which is consistent with recent standard\nconversion  factors  (SCFs)  applied  in  Asian  Development  Bank  and  World  Bank\nprojects. Economic prices were estimated by identifying the tradable (e.g., logs and\ntea)  and  nontradable  output.  The  economic  price  of  timber  (Table  A11.1)  was\nderived from the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price  in  local  currency adjusted\nfor  transport  and  handling  costs;  domestic  prices  were  adjusted  to  border  prices\nusing  the  SCF.  The  prices  for  internationally  traded  commodities  are  based  on\nWorld  Bank  commodity  price  projections  and  adjusted  for  quality  differences.  The\neconomic prices  for  nontradables  were  derived  from  their  financial  prices  that  are\nassumed to remain unchanged in real terms (constant 2000 prices).\n\nLabor: The Government minimum wage rate is SLRs135 per day; however, casual\nworkers demand a daily wage of between SLRs185 per day (with food and transport\nprovided)  and  SLRs200  per  day  (excluding  food  and  transport)  during  peak\nseasons. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.811 is applied to unskilled labor in line with\nseasonal unemployment and underemployment in the SPAs.\n\nthe \n\ncost \n\nfinancial \n\nSubproject  Costs:  The  economic  costs  of  each  subproject  were  derived  by\nadjusting \nincluding\nreforestation/afforestation  (excluding  price  escalations,  taxes,  and  duties)  by  the\nopportunity cost of labor and the SCF. Added to these are the subproject\u2019s share of\nproject costs, relating to intermediate goods in component one (planning, boundary\ndemarcations, and awareness and extension) and sector capacity strengthening in\ncomponent three (civil works, vehicles, equipment, training, consulting services).\n\ndevelopment \n\nforest \n\nfield \n\nof \n\nSubproject  Benefits:  For  all  but  one  core  subproject  intervention  only  directly\nquantifiable  benefits  have  been  included  in  the  economic  analysis.  The  direct\nbenefits  are  the  value  of  incremental  wood  production  and  agricultural  production\n(annual crops, fruit crops, and tea) generated under this project in the subprojects.\nTimber  production  has  been  calculated  from  the  trees\u2019  mean  annual  increment\n(measured in cubic meters per hectare) and rotation age under specific silviculture\nregimes and agro-ecological conditions. Any stock standing stock at the end of the\nperiod of analysis is valued at its stumpage value and included as a residual value.\n\n                                                  \n1\n\nLoan 1716-SRI, Coastal Resources Management Project, for $40 million, approved on 7 December 1999 used the\nshadow wage rate of 0.8.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nIndirect benefits are included with the enrichment of protection forests on the steep\nslopes in the central and upland region of Sri Lanka. These forests were established\nto  protect  soil  from  erosion  but  high  stocking  monoculture  stands  resulted  in  no\nunderstorey and often no ground litter. Such sites are at risk from erosion, and initial\nestimates for monoculture pines indicate as much as 27 tons/hectare (ha)/year (yr)\nof soil is likely being eroded. The sediment created has a high probability of being\ndelivered  into  one  of  two  important  dams  for  generating  hydroelectricity\u2014the\nVictoria or Ratambe dam.\n\n(v)\n\nPeriod of Analysis: The project period of analysis is set at 33 years to reflect a full\nrotation based on the project interventions occurring over the 7-year project period.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis\n\n2.\nUsing  the  above  assumptions  on  costs  and  benefits  at  the  subproject  level,  economic\ninternal rates of return were calculated for each core subproject as the base case summarized in\nTable  A11.2.  Two  sensitivity  cases  were  also  developed:  (i)  a  reduction  in  benefit  stream  by  10\npercent,  which  is  indicative  of  lower  mean  annual  increments;  and  (ii)  a  10  percent  increase  in\ncosts reflecting increased costs due to site factors and cost overruns. Details are in Table A11.3.\n\nTable A11.2: Economic Internal Rates of Returns/Results of Sensitivity Tests\n\nCore Subproject\n\nBase Costs\n\nDecrease of\n10%\nin Benefits\n\n10%\nIncrease in\nCosts\n\nAnuradhapura\nBadulla/N.

Four activities are analyzed, each with the private sector as the\nprimary beneficiary. First, cultivated land is converted into a diversified agroforestry plot.  Second,\ninvolving woodlot owners who have limited knowledge on silviculture or marketing of trees. Third,\nthe  intensification  of  agricultural  practice  in  encroached  land  based  on  lowland  tea  production.\nFourth,  the  establishment  of  private  sector  forest  concession  operations.  Remaining  field\ninterventions  target  Forest  Department  operations  where  the  decision  to  invest  is  based  on  the\neconomic rate of return as opposed to the private profits, and therefore were not assessed within a\nfinancial framework.\n\n\f1.\n\nAgroforestry Model\n\n70\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nThis model (for 1 ha) is based on the planting of multipurpose trees (timber and fruit) in a\n4.\nlow  density  that  enables  continued  annual  cropping.  Within  the  Sri  Lankan  context,  the  model\nreflects  an  extended  version  of  the  home  garden.  In  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  project  analysis,  income  is\nderived  from  swidden  farming2  systems,  that  is  converted  into  an  annual  land  rental  of\nSLRs17,500/ha/yr. The annual rental is used to reflect the foregone income from such land when it\nis  converted  from  swidden  farming.  The  output  of  the  model  is  based  on  production  of  annual\ncrops  (chilis,  gram,  corn,  soya,  and  millet),  with  medium-term  income  from  jack  fruit  trees,\nmangoes, lime, tamarind, and margosa followed by longer term income from acacia poles and teak\nlogs.  The levels of financial rates of return vary marginally based on the proportion of family labor\nrelative  to  the  total  labor  demand.  A  financial  rate  of  return  of  14-16  percent  was  derived  under\ndiffering hired labor scenarios with the higher rate associated with higher family labor input (Table\nA11.4).\n\n2.\n\nWoodlot Model\n\nThe  woodlot  model  is based  on the current community woodlot model  that  assumes 1\n5.\nha/individual  in  the  community.  Current  land  use  is based  on past  tree  planting  programs  where\ncommunity members were provided incentives to plant trees. Since then, there has been no follow\nup and many of the stands are currently of poor form and mixed species some of which have little\neconomic  value.    There  is  also  uncertainty  about  the  ownership  of  such  plots  and  the  trees  on\nthem.    The  ownership  will  be  clarified  and  reinforced  through  the  issuance  of  long-term  leases,\nalong with input to maximize the value of the existing stand through pole harvesting and thinning.\nAssistance  will  be  provided  in  harvesting  and  silviculture  training  and  the  establishment  of  a\nsecond rotation.  The financial returns are estimated to be about 15 percent after incorporating the\nlikely market value of existing trees in the model (Table A11.5). The \u201cwithout\u201d project case is based\non delayed harvesting and no replanting.\n\n3.\n\nBuffer Zone Management\n\nThis  1  ha  model  is  used  as  an  indicative  buffer  zone  intensification  intervention  and  is\n6.\nbased  on  the  actual  data  from  the  Tea  SmallHolder  Association  extension  program  for  tea\nintensification. The \u201cwithout\u201d project analysis is based on a continuation of the  current  yields and\ninputs. Under the \u201cwith\u201d project case, yields are increased  in  response  to  improved  management\ninputs and the use  of  mulches and fertilizer.  The  costs  of  implementing  the three-year  extension\nprogram are excluded as there is currently no cost recovery for the extension program. The rates\nof return are estimated to be 14 percent using the conservative estimate of yield response that has\nbeen achieved to date in the program.\n\n4.\n\nPrivate Sector Concessions\n\nThe private sector concessionaire model is based on forming private sector corporate entity\n7.\nto  own  a  1,200  ha  forest  concession.    Under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  project  scenario,  all  production  is\nconsidered to be incremental as there is no production in a \u201cwithout\u201d project scenario.
