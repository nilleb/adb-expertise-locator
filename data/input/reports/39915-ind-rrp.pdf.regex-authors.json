THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) Private Equity \nFund II (the Fund) in an amount of up to the lesser of $45 million or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total \nshare capital. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Background \n \n2.  The Indian economy has improved significantly over the past decade. The economic \nreforms introduced by the Government in 1991 have liberalized trade and industry, opened \nseveral sectors to private investment, and increased the role of market forces. The domestic \neconomy is also better integrated with the global economy through capital and technology flows. \nThe Tenth Five Year Plan (2002\u20132007) envisages an average gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth rate of 8%. It also specifies various other objectives aimed at enhancing human welfare.  \n \n3.  The provision of adequate infrastructure is essential for the achievement of growth \ntargets. A consensus has formed within the development community that there is also a strong \nlink between infrastructure development and poverty reduction. Given the large geographic area \nand population of India, the future financing requirements for infrastructure development are \nconsiderable.  The  India  Infrastructure  Report1  estimated  that  infrastructure  investment \nrequirements equal 7\u20138% of GDP. \n \n4.  The public sector has historically been the main provider of infrastructure in India. The \nbudget for 2005/06 sees large sums of money allocated for infrastructure, including as much as \nRs 930 billion for highway construction. The budget also includes the launch of a 4-year plan to \nimprove rural infrastructure. The plan is currently being drawn up, and funding for the plan has \nyet to be allocated. The Government\u2019s fiscal deficit currently stands at approximately 4.8% of \nGDP and the total public sector debt burden has reached 80% of GDP. This severely limits the \nability of the Government to meet the future infrastructure financing requirements, and the focus \nis shifting toward the private sector. Moving forward, the ability to mobilize private capital will be \nkey to infrastructure development in India. \n \n1.  Sector Review \n5.  Although recent government pronouncements have increasingly emphasized the need to \nsecure investment in major infrastructure projects, real progress has been made only in the \ntelecommunications sector and, more recently, in road construction.2\n \n2.  Roads \n6.  India's poor road network has received renewed emphasis in recent years. There are 3 \nmillion kilometers of roads, most of which are poorly maintained. National highways cover \n65,565 kilometers and carry approximately 40% of total road transport. The ambitious National \n                                                 \n1  National Council of Applied Economics and Research. 1996. India Infrastructure Report: Policy Imperatives for \nGrowth and Welfare. New Delhi. \n2 Main source for the sector review: Economist Intelligence Unit. 2004. Country Profile: India. London.  ", "2   \nHighway Development Program (NHDP) is upgrading more than 14,000 kilometers of national \nhighways in the Golden Quadrilateral (Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, and Mumbai) and the North\u2013\nSouth  and  East\u2013West  corridors  at  a  total  cost  of  approximately  $13  billion\u2013$15  billion.  In \naddition, plans have been developed to continue the expansion of the NHDP in five additional \nstages to be implemented over 7 years. The total cost of this new series of NHDP is estimated \nat $40 billion. The Government intends for the private sector to implement and finance 44% of \nthe  new  program.  In  addition  to  the  NHDP  program,  the  Government  plans  to  initiate  a \nnortheastern state program valued at $2.8 billion, of which the National Highway Authority of \nIndia will develop about 10\u201315% on a build-operate-transfer basis. The remaining 85\u201390% will \nbe developed by the Border Road Organization under public sector financing mechanisms. \n \n3.  Ports \n7.  India has 13 major ports, seven on the east coast and six on the west. They are \nmanaged  by  the  Port  Trust  of  India.  An  additional  148  minor  ports,  managed  by  state \ngovernments, account for 18% of total cargo handled. The major ports (encompassing 82% of \nall cargo) handled 314 million tons (t) of cargo in FY2002/03, compared with a capacity of 363 \nmillion tons. India\u2019s ports are plagued by inefficiency. Poor port governance and inefficient \ncustoms clearing translate into high costs. An identical shipment of textiles to the United States \nfrom India costs, on average, 20% more than from Thailand and 35% more than from China. \nGovernment initiatives to increase private sector participation include: automatic approval for up \nto  100%  foreign  ownership  in  port  and  harbor  construction  projects;  establishing  a  Tariff \nAuthority for Major Ports to determine port charges collected by private providers; and setting up \na Maritime States Development Council to help frame an integrated port development policy. \nThe Government has also drawn up plans to promote joint ventures between major Indian ports \nand minor foreign ports in a bid to attract new technology and improve management practices. \n \n4.  Civil Aviation \n8.  The state-owned domestic carrier, Indian Airlines, has retained a dominant position in air \ntransport  despite  liberalization  of  the  sector  to  allow  private  domestic\u2014but  not  foreign\u2014\noperators. Private operators, notably Jet Airways and Sahara, have steadily increased their \nmarket share. The state-owned international carrier, Air India, has continued to suffer losses as \na result of increased competition and a rising wage bill. Plans to lease out Mumbai, Delhi, \nChennai, and Kolkata international airports have been drawn up, and three new international \nairports will be constructed with private sector participation in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Goa. \n \n5.  Telecommunications \n9.  India\u2019s telecommunications sector has registered rapid growth in recent years, spurred \nby reforms to introduce greater competition to the sector. However, market penetration is still \nrelatively low. There is an average of one public phone for every 383 people living in India\u2019s \ncities, and 3.8 million of India's 6 million villages currently have a public telephone. Mobile \nphone services have been liberalized since 1994. The number of mobile subscribers grew from \n3.2 million at the end of 2000 to about 10.9 million by the end of 2003. Basic telecommunication \nservices have also been liberalized, but so far private services are being offered in only six \nstates (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Punjab). The \nstate-owned international call carrier lost its monopoly and was privatized on 1 April 2002. Long-\ndistance services have been open to private competition since January 2000. Rates for long-\ndistance and international calls have fallen, but remain high by international standards. Internet \nconnectivity remains low at six users per 1,000 people, compared with 26 users per 1,000 \npeople in China. ", "    3   \n \n \n6.  Power \n10.  Although total power generated has continued to increase, reaching 573.2 billion kilowatt \nhours in FY2001/02, shortages amounted to 6% of total demand, rising to over 12% at peak \ntimes. Problems in the power sector include inefficient state electricity boards, high levels of \npower theft, unsound cross-subsidization policies, and chronic underinvestment. The average \ncost of power in India exceeds Rs4 per unit. This compares with less than Rs2 in the United \nStates and Rs2.5 in South Korea. India\u2019s power sector urgently requires substantial investment. \nHowever, after decades of neglect, the public sector lacks the necessary resources, and the \nprivate  sector  is  unwilling  to  fill  the  gap,  deterred  by  the  fact  that  the  main  electricity \npurchasers\u2014the state-owned State Electricity Boards\u2014are bankrupt. Only industry is charged a \nmarket rate, while more than 25% of power generated is lost in transmission and distribution, \nmuch  of  it  stolen.  The  central  Government  has  drawn  up  an  agreement  with  the  state \nadministrations whereby State Electricity Boards would charge users market rates for electricity, \nreserving subsidies for those genuinely in need. In return, the central Government will cover the \n$5.6 billion that the Sate Electricity Boards owe power generators, through the issue of long-\nterm bonds. In an effort to stimulate further investment in the power sector, proposals for 100% \nforeign direct investment in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution projects up to \naround $300 million receive automatic approval. Power transmission has also been opened to \nthe private sector. \n \n7.  Coal, Oil, and Gas \n11.  India\u2019s total coal reserves are estimated to be about 200 billion tons, while proven \nreserves total about 70 billion tons. Coal accounts for 67% of commercial energy supplies, but it \nis a polluting and inefficient energy source because of its high ash content. Low levels of mining \nproductivity are also a serious problem. In an attempt to promote greater investment, regulation \nhas been reduced and coal mining no longer requires licenses. India is a net importer of oil. In \nFY1998/99, India produced 64.5 million tons of refined products and consumed 90.6 million \ntons.  Boosted  by  the  start  of  production  at  Reliance  Industries\u2019  27  million-ton  refinery,  in \nFY2001/02 the crude imports deficit of refined products turned into a net export of 3.1 million \ntons. Over 75% of India\u2019s total estimated reserves of 17 billion tons oil equivalent is in the form \nof natural gas. India has introduced measures to encourage the production of natural gas. With \nregard to distribution, the price and distribution controls that were introduced at the time of the \noil crisis in the 1970s were finally removed on 1 April 2002, and a number of Indian and foreign \ncompanies have received licenses to open petrol stations.  \n \n8.   Tourism Sector \n12.  A  sustained  promotional  campaign  undertaken  by  the  Government  has  led  to  a \nsubstantial increase in foreign tourists\u2014to more than 3 million arrivals in 2004. Occupancy rates \nand average room rentals have surged, leading to strong growth for companies in the industry, \nreflected by the robust performance of hotel companies. A number of companies are expanding \ncapacity to meet the acute shortage of rooms and increase their borrowings, which provides \nopportunities  for  equity  investors.  Tourist  inflow  is  likely  to  continue  to  increase  with  the \nimprovement of airports and road infrastructure across the country. \n \n13.  Across  all  sectors,  infrastructure  remains  inadequate  to  support  sustained  high \neconomic growth rates. However, regulations are evolving to support private sector participation \nand generate more investment opportunities in Indian infrastructure businesses.  \n ", "4   \n \n \nB.   Challenges and Opportunities\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n14.  In order to overcome impediments, the Government of India launched the Infrastructure \nDevelopment Finance Company Ltd. (IDFC) in 1997 to finance private sector infrastructure \nprojects. ADB was an investor in IDFC from its inception. To date, IDFC is effectively a publicly \nowned company, but it is in the process of increasing its private ownership and has recently \nlisted its shares on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges. Over the past few years, IDFC \nhas  rapidly  expanded  its  rupee-based  lending  to  Indian  infrastructure  projects  and  firmly \nestablished its position in the Indian market. \n \n15.  While  local-currency  debt  capital  is  now  available  for  infrastructure  projects,  equity \ncapital is still lacking. Financial institutions and commercial banks conduct due diligence of \ninfrastructure  undertakings  and  assess  the  technological  and  commercial  viability  of  the \nprojects. In most situations, the financial institutions and commercial banks insist on a financing \nmix of debt and equity with a ratio of 70 to 30.  \n \n16.  There have been many situations in which domestic entrepreneurs in India have been \nunable  to  raise  their  equity  contribution  for  otherwise  viable  projects.  Investments  in \ninfrastructure projects have been restrained because of this lack of equity capital. \n \n17.  To  promote  equity  investment  in  infrastructure,  the  Government  has  added  a  new \nclause\u2014Section 10 (23G)\u2014to the Income Tax Act that provides financial incentives for equity \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  undertaken  by  infrastructure  funds  and  infrastructure  capital \ncompanies. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has recognized funds with a \nclear focus on infrastructure as venture capital funds, and has permitted their registration as \nsuch. By registering as venture capital funds, these entities are entitled to certain financial \nbenefits, such as a 10-year tax holiday, and are exempted from obtaining approvals from the \nReserve Bank of India and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Appendix 1 reviews recent \nregulatory changes supporting private equity investments in India.   \n \n18.  To complement the IDFC\u2019s provision of debt capital, the Ministry of Finance in 2003 set \nup the India Development Fund I, an infrastructure equity fund managed by IDFC Private \nEquity, a 100% subsidiary of IDFC. The India Development Fund I is the predecessor fund of \nthe proposed Fund.  \n \n19.  The India Development Fund I\u2019s shareholders include leading financial institutions in \nIndia. In effect, the fund is mostly owned by state-owned companies. One of the purposes of \nADB's possible involvement is to support the Fund in mobilizing resources from international \ninvestors for the first time.   \n \n \n \n ", "    5   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FUND \nA.  Objectives and Description  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n20.  ADB proposes to make an equity investment in the Fund in an amount of up to the \nlesser of $45 million or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total share capital, including parallel vehicles, if any. \nADB will not be the largest investor in the Fund, taking into consideration the commitments to \nthe Indian fund, at any time.  \n \n21.  The primary objective of the Fund will be to achieve medium-term capital gains by \ninvesting in high-growth infrastructure businesses in India, principally through equity or equity-\nrelated instruments. The Fund aims to take advantage of the ongoing increase in expenditures \nin Indian infrastructure by focusing on investments in private companies engaged in developing, \nconstructing, maintaining, or operating infrastructure facilities or services in India. The Fund may \nalso invest in foreign companies that have a significant presence in India and play a substantial \nrole in providing infrastructure facilities or services. \n \nB.   Sponsor and Co-investors \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n22.  The Fund will be managed by IDFC Private Equity Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the \nInfrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC), an Indian financial institution set up in \n1997, which focuses on financing infrastructure projects in India. \n \n23.  The sponsor of the Fund is IDFC, which has extensive expertise in appraising and \nfinancing large infrastructure projects.  \n \n24.  IDFC Private Equity is currently managing India\u2019s largest domestic infrastructure fund, \nthe India Development Fund I. The Fund manager has taken a proactive role in sourcing \ninvestments and created most of India Development Fund I\u2019s transactions.  \n \n25.  In just 2 years the team has invested most of the Fund and in doing so has created a \nreputation for smooth execution and competence.  \n \nC.   Governance Structure  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n26.  The  Indian  fund  will  be  managed  by  IDFC  Private  Equity  Limited,  a  public  limited \ncompany incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The role of the Fund manager is \nto (i) identify potential fund investment opportunities, (ii) screen investment proposals based on \na thorough appraisal of the feasibility and risks, (iii) supervise and monitor fund investments, (iv) \ndispose of the shares of companies invested at the time of exit, and (v) undertake all Fund \naccounting, compliance, and investor reporting. The Fund manager will be contractually bound \nto carry out its responsibilities in accordance with the Fund\u2019s investment policy.  \n    \n \n \n \n ", "6   \nIV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Development Impact \n27.  By  providing  financing  for  this  transaction,  ADB  intends  to  achieve  the  following \ndevelopment objectives: \n \n(i)  Help India meet the infrastructure development requirements that are essential \nfor sustained economic growth.  \n(ii)  Support the Government\u2019s strategy of encouraging private sector participation in \ninfrastructure  development,  given  the  large  investment  requirements  and  the \nlimited  amount  of  public  sector  financing  available.  The  Fund  will  help  the \nGovernment reroute resources from investments in infrastructure to other types \nof expenditure. \n(iii)  Mobilize long-term capital in the form of private equity from private sources for \ninfrastructure development. \n(iv)  Diversify sources of finance available to infrastructure companies by including \nequity finance, which enables these companies to buy fixed assets to be used as \ncollateral for commercial bank loans, thereby leveraging their expansion.  \n(v)  Demonstrate to the private sector that investment in infrastructure companies in \nIndia can be commercially attractive, thus mobilizing investments by building up \nlocal private equity investment management capacity in a specialized area. \n(vi)  Contribute  to  the  development  of  a  well-functioning  regulatory  and  legal \nenvironment in India. The Fund will be required to collect consistent information \non  regulatory  problems  encountered  by  the  infrastructure  businesses  in  the \nportfolio encounter. The Fund will report this information on a regular basis to \nADB's  South  Asia  Department  to  support  the  formulation  of  a  conducive \nregulatory framework for private infrastructure companies. \n \n2.  Value added of ADB  \n \n28.  ADB involvement adds value to the Fund in the following ways: \n \n(i)  Catalytic and demonstration effect. Given the significant risks and challenges \nfacing potential investors, ADB will serve a catalytic role in attracting additional \nlocal and foreign long-term private investments to India. ADB will demonstrate by \nits intervention the credibility of infrastructure equity finance in India and mobilize \ncapital  to  support  other  private  equity  funds.  This  Fund  is  particularly  well \npositioned to achieve a demonstration effect as ADB is to support the Fund in \nmobilizing resources from international investors for the first time.  \n \n(ii)  Private sector development. The Fund will make a direct contribution to private \nsector development in India. The Fund, with a portion of its funding coming from \nprivate institutional investors, will employ market-based mechanisms to develop \nprofitable and sustainable private infrastructure companies. ADB\u2019s contribution ", "    7   \nwill help India implement its private sector development strategy by fostering the \nprovision of infrastructure services from private companies. \n \n29.  ADB  is  developing  an  investment  strategy  that  includes  a  portfolio  approach  to  its \ninvestment fund operations. This strategy stresses the relevance and impact of ADB\u2019s private \nequity investments and describes how ADB intends to tailor ADB's products to the specific \nrequirements of the beneficiary countries.  \n \nB.  Measuring Development Effectiveness \n \n30.  PSOD and Operations Evaluation Department (OED) are in the process of formulating \nguidelines for implementing good practice standards (GPS) for evaluation of private sector \ninvestment  operations,  which  were  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group3  of  the \nmultilateral development banks. These GPS cover the roles of the independent evaluation \ndepartment and the private sector department itself, the evaluation dimensions for private sector \noperations,  the  nature  of  annual  reporting,  dissemination  of  reports,  and  lessons  learned. \nAccording  to  the  GPS,  the  three  principal  dimensions  for  private  sector  evaluation  are \ndevelopment  outcome,  investment  profitability  for  the  multilateral  finance  institution,  and \noperational effectiveness. PSOD will measure the expected development outcome of this Fund \nat the Fund level, the subproject level, and beyond the Fund by monitoring certain performance \nmeasures for the duration of the Fund. The performance measures for development outcome \nare encompassed in three key areas: \n(i)  Business performance. Will assess the extent to which the Fund has reached \nits objectives in terms of overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand subprojects.  \n \n(ii)  Economic sustainability. Will evaluate the Fund's and subprojects' effects on \nthe  developing  member  country's  economy  and  the  associated  benefits  and \ncosts.  On  one  hand,  these  measures  assess  the  extent  to  which  the  Fund \nimproved the allocation of resources and provision of financial services to viable \nprivate enterprises. On the other hand, these measures evaluate whether the \nsubprojects directly generated benefits to the local economy. \n \n(iii)  Private sector development. Addresses the Fund\u2019s impact on private sector \ndevelopment beyond the Fund and its immediate stakeholders\u2014i.e., the Fund\u2019s \ncontribution to the growth of viable financial institutions and financial markets \ndevelopment. \n \n31.  A set of quantitative and qualitative performance measures has been developed to track \nthe development impact of this investment for each key area. These performance measures are \nprovided in Appendix 2. \n \nC.   Environmental Protection and Social Safeguard Guidelines \n \n                                                 \n3  The Evaluation Cooperation Group was established by the multilateral development banks for the purpose of \ndesigning common evaluation standards for private sector operations. The Evaluation Cooperation Group\u2019s work is \nongoing and some aspects of the existing evaluative framework might be subject to change according to best \npractices. \n ", "8   \n32.  The Fund is classified as category FI.4 The Project's impact on indigenous peoples has \nbeen classified as C (no impact). All companies in which the Fund invests will also comply with \nADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies, including policies related to involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous people as well as all environmental laws and regulations in force \nwithin  the  relevant  jurisdiction.  The  Fund  will  also  comply  with  anti-money  laundering  and \nfinancing of terrorism policies. \n \n33.  The  implementation  of  an  environmental  management  system  that  includes  ADB \nenvironmental and social safeguards represents an essential value addition by ADB to this \nprivate equity fund. Close coordination with ADB will be necessary to ensure that the Fund \nmanager possesses the skills to screen and categorize prospective investments based on \nenvironmental and social impacts. The Fund will ensure that at least one of its employees has \nreceived environmental training and training in application of ADB's social safeguard policies. \nThe Fund manager will appoint a senior officer to implement and supervise the environmental \nand  social  management  system  and  an  environmental  coordinator  to  conduct  reviews  of \ninvestee companies with respect to all applicable ADB policies. The Fund has developed and is \ncommitted to implementing an environmental management system that is satisfactory to ADB. \nThe  environmental  management  system  might  be  adapted  to  accommodate  bilateral \ndevelopment finance institutions that invest in the Fund, in which case it will be submitted to \nADB\u2019s Environment and Social Safeguards Division for approval.  \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n34.  ADB will enter into suitable documentation that will indicate ADB\u2019s commitment to invest \nan amount up to the lesser of $45,000,000 or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total share capital (including \nparallel investment vehicles, if any) following approval of the investment by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors. ADB will not be the largest investor in the Fund, taking into consideration investments \ninto the Indian fund. ADB will satisfy itself with the terms and conditions of the all principal \ndocuments associated with its investment in the Fund.  \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed investment in IDFC Private Equity Fund II as described \nin this report complies with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board \napprove the investment of up to the lesser of $45,000,000 or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total share \ncapital (including parallel investment vehicles, if any) in IDFC Private Equity Fund II from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n10 January 2006 \n \n                                                 \n4  FI stands for financial intermediary. ", "    9   \n \nTHE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY INDUSTRY IN INDIA \n \n1.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued its Regulations for Venture \nCapital in 1996, thus establishing the agency\u2019s authority over the funds, the limits on their \nactivities, and incentives for them to finance and rescue troubled companies. There are no legal \nor  regulatory  differences  between  venture  capital  firms  and  private  equity  firms.  The \nGovernment first permitted financial institutions, commercial banks (including foreign banks), \nand subsidiaries of commercial banks to establish venture capital companies under guidelines \nissued in 1988. In addition, under current central-bank regulations, banks\u2019 investments in mutual \nfunds catering to venture capital funding are considered to be outside the ceilings applicable to \nbanks\u2019 investments in corporate equity and debt.1\n \n2.  India has allowed foreign venture capital funds to operate since 1995. They may either \nhold shares of unlisted Indian companies directly (up to a maximum of 25% of equity) or route \ntheir investments through domestic venture capital funds and companies. Prior to guidelines \nissued in September 2000, direct exposure by offshore private equity funds in shares of unlisted \ncompanies was treated as a foreign direct investment, and approval was needed, in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s general policy on foreign investments. Indocean Venture Fund (now Indocean \nChase), originally set up by George Soros and Chemical Bank, was the first such overseas \nprivate equity fund. \n \n3.  The regulatory environment for the private equity industry was being simplified during \n1995\u20132000.  Foreign  institutional  investors  participated  in  the  growth  of  the  private  equity \nindustry through the foreign direct investment regulations of the Government and the simplified \ntax administration procedures under the Indo\u2013Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty. \nWhile the foreign direct investment route offered minimum investment restrictions for private \nequity funds, exit pricing and repatriation of capital were regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. \nIn order to bring these capital flows under regulations of the venture capital industry, new SEBI \nregulations  were  issued  with  simplified  exit  pricing  and  repatriation  procedures  for  foreign \ninvestors. \n \n4.  Following amendments to the 2000 budget, the Government allowed private equity funds \n\u201cpass-through\u201d status, meaning that no tax is levied on the distributed or undistributed income of \nthe funds. To avoid double taxation, a private equity fund's income is taxed only in the hands of \nthe investor. \n \n5.  SEBI was also made the sole regulatory authority, to which private equity funds must \nsubmit quarterly reports. In September 2000 SEBI announced the guidelines that currently \ngovern  venture  capital  investment,  based  on  the  January  2000  recommendations  of  the \nChandrashekhar committee on venture capital. After another set of amendments in April 2004, \nthe following rules now apply: \n(i)  Foreign venture capital investors can invest in India without approvals from the \nForeign Investment Promotion Board if they register with SEBI. \n                                                 \n1  Dossani,  Rafiq,   and   Martin  Kenney.   2002.

The \nfund cannot invest in associated companies of ventures that it finances. \n(iv)  A fund must invest 66.67% (lowered from 75% in April 2004) of its investable \nfunds in unlisted equity or equity-linked instruments. The remaining 33.3% can \nbe invested in subscriptions to initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies or in \ndebt instruments of a company in which the venture fund has already made an \nequity investment. \n(v)  The  April  2004  amendments  removed  a  previous  one-year  lock-up  for  IPO \nsubscriptions.  They  also  allowed  investments  within  the  33.3%  category  in \npreferential allotments of equity shares of a listed company, subject to a one-year \nlock-in, and in equity shares or equity-linked instruments of a listed company that \nis financially weak. \n(vi)  The removal of a profitability criterion as a listing requirement had an important \neffect  on  the  private  equity  industry  as  it  provided  an  exit  mechanism  for \ninvestors,  in  particular  for  technology  companies.  To  replace  the  profitability \nrequirement, a firm will would be delisted if it did not earn profits within 3 years of \nlisting. \n(vii)  Acquisition of shares by the investee company or its promoters from a venture \nfund is exempt from the provisions of the takeover code and will therefore not \nmandate an open offer. \n(viii)  Mutual funds may invest 5% of the corpus of an open-ended scheme and 10% of \nthe corpus of a closed-ended scheme in a venture fund. \n(ix)  In April 2004 the SEBI also removed some previous restrictions, allowing venture \nfunds to invest in real-estate companies, in gold-financing companies, and in \nequipment-leasing and hire\u2013purchase companies registered with the RBI. \n \n6.  These regulations significantly improve the regulatory environment for private equity \nfunds operating in India, such as the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) \nPrivate Equity Fund II. In addition, they reflect a strong commitment by the Indian Government \nto support the provision of long-term equity finance to domestic entrepreneurial companies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "1\n  2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES  p\ne\nn\nd\nix\n   2\n \n1.
