I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, (ii) a proposed grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia, \nand (iii) a proposed grant to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), all for the \nSecond Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project. \n \n2.  The 5-year project builds on the achievements and lessons learned from the first Greater \nMekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project (RCDCP),1 which played \na major role in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in containing the spread of emerging \ndiseases, improving provincial health systems and communicable disease control (CDC) in \nvulnerable groups, and strengthening regional cooperation. The project will further enhance \nregional  CDC  systems,  including  improved  regional  cooperation  capacity,  expanded \nsurveillance  and  response  systems,  and  targeted  support  for  the  control  of  dengue  and \nneglected tropical diseases (NTDs).2 It will also improve provincial capacity for CDC, including \nstaff training and community-based CDC in border districts. The project will particularly benefit \nthe poor and ethnic groups in border districts, especially women and children.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian \ninfluenza, and swine flu have had major economic impacts on productivity, trade, and tourism in \nthe GMS, and continue to pose a major public health concern. New diseases, mostly of animal \norigin, also pose a constant threat. Dengue, chikungunya, cholera, typhoid, and HIV/AIDS\u2014\nfueled  by  better  connectivity,  urban  development,  and  social  and  environment  changes\u2014\ncontinue to spread in the GMS. Controlling these diseases requires strong surveillance systems, \ncommunity prevention and preparedness, and quick system response capacities. \n \n4.  Leaders of the GMS have given high priority to the control of emerging diseases, and \nmore recently also dengue and NTDs. All GMS countries endorse and seek to implement the \nnew International Health Regulations (World Health Organization [WHO], 2005) for the reporting \nand containment of outbreaks and disasters of international concern. Several regional strategies \nare being rolled out, including the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED), and \nstrategies  for  the  control  of  dengue  and  NTDs.  GMS  governments  are  fully  committed  to \nimplementing these strategies, and to strengthening provincial health systems to support CDC. \nWith  increased  connectivity,  CDC  needs  closer  attention\u2014forecasting,  risk  mitigation,  and \nreinforcing  public  health  fundamentals\u2014so  as  to  contain  transmission  of  and  exposure  to \npathogens, and this requires a multisector approach. However, the immediate need is to contain \nany  new  outbreak.  While  Southeast  Asia  has  been  the  center  of  emerging  diseases, \nsurveillance and response systems, community preparedness, and health system support in \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam are still not up to the standards of neighboring countries.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project. Manila (Grants \n0025-CAM, 0026-LAO, and 0027-VIE, for a total of $30 million). \n2   Including Japanese encephalitis, helminthiasis, and schistosomiasis. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2     \n5.  Under the GMS program, the RCDCP was initiated in 2005 in partnership with the WHO, \nand closed in 2010. The ministries of health (MOHs) are highly appreciative of the RCDCP, \nwhich was very timely with the outbreak of avian influenza, escalation of dengue, and an \nemerging HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Lao PDR. The RCDCP strengthened provincial surveillance \nand outbreak response capacity and provided provinces with a flexible response capacity to \ndeal with disease outbreaks. Within 36 targeted provinces, the RCDCP also built up provincial \nhealth  systems  capacity  for  CDC.  The  third  output  (regional  capacity  building  for  CDC) \nsupported  regional  cooperation  capacity  and  knowledge  management,  and  harmonizing \nregional strategies for disease control and cross-border cooperation. A regional coordination \nunit (RCU) for building regional coordination and knowledge management, and international \nconsultants, were financed through a regional pooled fund managed by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). Benefits of regional approaches are emerging in terms of information exchange, \njoint strategic planning, and cross-border disease control efforts.  \n \n6.  Important lessons have been learned in the RCDCP. First, the RCDCP experienced \nsome initial delay in Cambodia as it became effective just after the annual budget cycle, and in \nViet Nam due to staff constraints and lengthy procurement procedures. The project will use \ncurrent  RCDCP  project  management  units  (PMUs)  and  advance  action  to  reduce  start-up \ndelays.  Second,  the  geographic  targeting  of  the  RCDCP  was  not  optimal;  the  project  will \ntherefore focus on border districts and remote communities. A better prepared and resourced \ngender action plan (GAP) and ethnic group plan and better monitoring and evaluation will also \nhelp improve targeting. Third, training activities remained highly centralized; the project will help \nestablish provincial training systems to improve provincial training capacity. Fourth, community-\nbased dengue control was less sustainable, and needs to be improved further with support of \nexperts. Fifth, regional cooperation and knowledge management were slow to emerge; the \nproject will help strengthen the institutional capacity of each MOH in these areas.    \n \n7.  The project follows Strategy 2020,4 which realigns ADB's role in the health sector with \nemphasis  on  regional,  intersector,  and  interagency  cooperation,  as  also  detailed  in  the \noperational  plan  for  health.5 It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nStrategy,6 the GMS regional cooperation strategy7 and the country partnership strategies and \ncountry operations business plans of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.8 The project supports \nregional public goods and capacity towards regional health and economic security and the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for reducing child mortality and malnutrition, halting the \nspread of communicable diseases, and others. In partnership with WHO, the Mekong Basin \nDisease Surveillance Cooperation, the Kenan Institute Asia and other partners, it addresses \ncritical funding gaps for the roll-out of the International Health Regulations (2005) and APSED, \nas well as regional strategies for the control of dengue and NTDs. Under the leadership of WHO, \nregional and national aid coordination mechanisms are in place including regular meetings, \nsurveys and publications for aid coordination, technical forums, community of practice groups, \nand websites.9   \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.

The expected \nproject outcome will be timely and adequate control of communicable diseases of regional \nrelevance (see Appendix 1 for indicators).   \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  Based on achievements and lessons learned in the RCDCP, three outputs have been \nformulated: (i) enhanced regional CDC systems, (ii) improved CDC along borders and economic \ncorridors, and (iii) integrated project management.  \n \n10.  The first output supports regional and national disease surveillance and control. The \nsecond output will focus on 38 provinces10 for capacity building; and 1,160 lagging villages with \na total population of about 1.7 million in 116 border districts for community-based CDC. For the \nsecond output, efforts have been made to make the clusters of targeted provinces contiguous. \nThree clusters have been identified: (i) the northern corridor in Viet Nam and the Lao PDR \nbordering the People\u2019s Republic of China; (ii) the central corridor in central Viet Nam, southern \nLao PDR, and northeast Cambodia; and (iii) the southern corridor between Viet Nam and \nCambodia, connecting to Thailand.  \n \n11.  The selection of provinces was based on these having major links with neighboring \ncountries, and being considered major corridors for the spread of communicable diseases. \nPrioritization of villages in targeted districts will be based on needs, vulnerability, connectivity, \nand feasibility. At least half of the targeted population in the villages will belong to ethnic \nminority groups. The third output will support PMUs and project implementation units under the \nadministrative umbrella of the assigned department in each MOH.    \n \n1.  Output 1: Enhanced Regional Communicable Disease Control Systems \n12.  Improved  capacity  for regional  cooperation  in  communicable  disease  control. \nBuilding on the RCDCP, the project will further enhance regional cooperation in CDC to achieve \n(i) improved MOH capacity for regional cooperation in CDC, (ii) coordinated implementation of \nregional strategies, and (iii) sustained knowledge management. The project will strengthen focal \npoints in each MOH for regional CDC coordination and knowledge management; and assist the \nWHO and the ministries to roll out and strengthen regional CDC strategies, including APSED. \nThe project will also support each MOH to participate in regional activities, including the regional \nsteering committee and project workshops; and continue knowledge management activities \ninitiated under the RCDCP, including technical forums and community of practice for dengue, \nJapanese encephalitis, laboratory services, cross-border activities, NTDs, and human resource \ndevelopment. The project will seek regional partnerships for the CDC clearing house and other \nCDC activities such as standard setting and policy-related studies. An RCU based in MOH, the \nLao PDR, will continue to coordinate regional activities and support the knowledge management \nprogram. ADB will manage a small part of the grants for the financing of joint activities.   \n \n13.  Expanded  surveillance  and  response  systems.  ADB  will  continue  to  support \nprovincial capacity for outbreak investigation and response. Output 1 will support (i) regional \ncoordination of surveillance and response systems, (ii) provincial surveillance and response \n                                                 \n10 Including 10 provinces in Cambodia, 12 in Lao PDR, and 16 in Viet Nam (four additional provinces in Viet Nam \nsupported during the RCDCP will be phased out during the project).   \n ", "4     \ncapacity and financing outbreak control, (iii) improving quality of laboratory services, (iv) scaling \nup cross-border cooperation, and (v) improving outbreak reporting systems for major hospitals. \nThe project will seek partnership with, and if possible support, the Mekong Basin Disease \nSurveillance Cooperation and other partners for cross-border activities.  \n  \n14.  Targeted  support  for  emerging  and  neglected  diseases.  The  project  will  also \ncontinue to provide targeted support for dengue and NTDs, including Japanese encephalitis, \nsoil-transmitted helminthiasis, opisthorchiasis, schistosomiasis, and filariasis. This will include   \n(i) joint assessments of the spread and determinants of dengue and NTDs along economic \ncorridors;  and  (ii)  effective  control  measures  including  behavioral  change  communication, \nequipment, vaccines, and medical supplies.   \n \n2.  Output  2:  Improved  Communicable  Disease  Control  along  Borders  and \nEconomic Corridors \n \n15.  Improved community-based communicable disease control. Border areas are at \nhigher risk of disease outbreaks due to their proximity to borders and economic corridors, while \nat  the  same  time  having  access  problems  combined  with  weak  health  systems  and  less-\ninformed  and  endowed  communities.  Many  of  these  communities  are  ethnic  groups,  new \nsettlements, or peri-urban migrants. Under this sub-output, the project will target about 1,160 \npoor,  remote  communities  (on  average  two  per  year  per  district)  with  a  total  estimated \npopulation  of  1.76  million  in  116  border  districts  in  38  provinces\u201416  in  Viet  Nam,  10  in \nCambodia, and 12 in the Lao PDR. This will include (i) training of village health workers,          \n(ii) participatory assessment and planning, (iii) community preparedness and school education \ncampaigns, (iv) cross-border cooperation, and (v) accelerated healthy village development.    \n  \n16.  Improved staff capacity in communicable disease control. To improve provincial \ncapacity on a more sustainable basis, the project will build a provincial training system in each \nof the 38 targeted provinces based on policies, standards, and local potential. This will include \n(i)  setting  up  a  provincial  training  group,  (ii)  improving  human  resources  management,             \n(iii)  developing  a  provincial  in-service  training  system  for  the  sector,  (iv)  improving  staff \nperformance, and (v) reducing staff gaps by providing scholarships for field epidemiology and \nethnic persons for training as health staff. This will require, among other things, training of \ntrainers and equipping provincial schools.    \n \n3.  Output 3: Integrated Project Management \n17.  The third output will support effective and sustainable project management through \nPMUs, project implementation units, and national implementation units under the administrative \numbrella of each MOH subsector program. This includes support for (i) provincial stewardship, \nmanagement capacity, and results-based management; (ii) improving procurement, financial \nmanagement, and technical support; and (iii) mainstreaming and sustaining project activities in \nprovincial annual operational plans including provincial training systems, special support for \nisolated  communities,  compliance  with  social  safeguards,  adequate  recurrent  budget,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $54.00 million including contingencies of $5.60 million. \nThe investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n \n19.  The governments have requested ADB to provide a total of $49 million in loan and \ngrants from its Special Funds resources (90.7% of the project amount) to help finance the \nproject: the Government of Viet Nam has requested a loan of $27.0 million with a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. The Government of Cambodia has requested a grant not exceeding $10.0 million \nand the Government of the Lao PDR has requested a grant not exceeding $12.0 million (Table \n2). About 5% of the grants will be pooled as under the RCDCP, and managed by ADB based on \nestablished guidelines. The governments will provide counterpart funds totaling $5.00 million \nequivalent\u2014Cambodia $1.00 million, the Lao PDR $1.00 million, and Viet Nam $3.00 million\u2014in \ncash  (Viet  Nam  only),  taxes  and  duties,  government  contributions  in  kind  (staff  salaries, \nfacilities, recurrent costs), and community contributions in kind. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem    Cambodia Lao PDR  Viet Nam  Totala \nA.

Emerging diseases have had a major economic impact in the GMS, and new diseases \nare expected at the rate of about one per year, posing a constant health hazard.12 The project, \nby strengthening the regional surveillance and response capacity, will help curb epidemics \nresulting in reduced economic losses, mortality, morbidity, and medical costs. The project will \nalso target about 1.7 million people in 1,160 villages in 116 border districts, and within these \ndistricts target remote communities. While overall about 31% of the district population belongs \nto various ethnic groups, the project will aim for half of the targeted population being ethnic \nminorities. These communities lag behind in health indicators, in large part due to common \ninfectious diseases including NTDs. For most NTDs, highly cost-effective interventions are \navailable, such as vaccines or low-cost medicine. Bringing these diseases under control also \nrequires cross-border cooperation. Some 25% of the people in border districts will directly \nbenefit from project investments that will help them progress toward health-related MDGs. The \npoor, women and children will be the major beneficiaries of these community-level interventions.  \n \n22.  Technical  challenges  include  (i)  strengthening  regional  cooperation  and  knowledge \nmanagement for CDC on a sustainable basis; (ii) accessing border districts and communities; \n(iii) community-based dengue control; and (iv) integrating cross-border cooperation, training, \nand social safeguards in provincial planning and budgeting. The project provides for capacity \nbuilding and initial support in these areas, and also includes several assurances. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The economic analysis provides the rationale for public sector involvement, a discussion \non provider options, the possible financial effect of the project, expected public sector behavior, \nand an estimated economic internal rate of return of 28%. The benefits of the project will come \nfrom  (i)  helping  prevent  major  epidemics;  (ii) productivity  gains  from  a  reduced  burden  of \ndiseases; (iii) productivity gains from improved achievements in education, especially through \nless absenteeism and reduced drop out rates; and (iv) public and private savings in health \nexpenditures, including indirect costs. However, some of these benefits are difficult to measure. \nOnly items (i) and (ii) were considered in the economic internal rate of return.   \n \n24.  The project\u2019s recurrent costs represent only a minor percentage of government health \nexpenditure as a percentage of domestic spending on health\u20140.1% in Viet Nam, 0.3% in \nCambodia, and 1.3% in the Lao PDR. The figure for the Lao PDR is quite high because \ndomestic spending is very low at $1.5 per person per year. Government expenditures for \nrecurrent costs are increasing, indicating future sustainability of the project.  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Each MOH has gained substantial experience in implementing ADB-assisted projects, \nand has staff with skills and experience in ADB procedures. Arrangements have been made to \nfurther improve administrative and financial management practices. The governments have \ngiven  assurances  that  capable  project  staff  will  be  appointed  in  a  timely  manner.                    \n                                                 \n12 For example, the SARS caused widespread social disruption and economic losses. Schools, hospitals, and some \nborders were closed and thousands of people were placed in quarantine. International travel to affected areas fell \nby 50%\u201370%; hotel occupancy dropped by more than 60%. World Health Organization. 2003. SARS: Lessons from \na New Disease. http://www.who.int/whr/2003/chapter5/en/index.html. \n ", "8     \nThe governments support decentralization to the provinces, including delegation of financial \nauthorities, for activities to be implemented by the provinces.  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  There  were  no  major \ngovernance issues during implementation of the RCDCP, and the same PMUs will be used for \nthe project. ADB's specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The targeted border districts have a high proportion of families living below or near the \npoverty line who depend heavily on the availability of a healthy labor force in the family. Any \nserious  disease  or  death  in  the  family  may  throw  the  family  into  even  deeper  poverty, \nmalnutrition, and ill health. Improved connectivity is facilitating the spread of communicable \ndiseases such as HIV, emerging diseases, dengue, and NTDs. People in border districts are \nless informed about these hazards, including trafficking and migrant labor, and have less access \nto services. By helping improve regional health and economic security, the project will protect \nthe poor against catastrophic events, and improve their health, learning, and productivity. \n \n28.  Gender is a significant variable for understanding the spread of communicable diseases, \nas well as designing and delivering appropriate communicable disease prevention and control. \nWomen and girls have specific health needs and are the usual custodians for the prevention, \ndetection, and care of infectious diseases amongst family members. Although the majority of \nhealth staff are often female, women are more often in lower-level positions. Only Cambodia \nhas a policy of having both female and male village health workers. Increasing gender equity in \nhealth staff will improve CDC outcomes. To ensure the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming \nand gender-related outcomes in the project, each MOH will fully implement the GAP, key \nfeatures of which are mirrored in the project design and monitoring framework, loan assurances, \nand PAM. The GAP is aligned with national and sector-specific gender equality commitments in \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.13 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Ethnic groups constitute 31% of the population in the targeted border districts, most of \nthem in the Lao PDR. They suffer disproportionately from common communicable diseases, \nand have less access to health care because of physical, financial, language, and cultural \nbarriers. The project is assessed category B for indigenous people and is expected to have \npositive impacts on ethnic groups. The accrual of benefits to ethnic groups is discussed in the \nethnic groups plan, and included in the project design. Under the sub-output for community-\nbased CDC, the aim is that 50% of 1,160 targeted villages belong to ethnic groups. This \nincludes training of village health workers and support for healthy village development. The \nproject will also provide scholarships for ethnic group members to become health workers. The \nproject is assessed category C for both environment and involuntary resettlement. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 Gender Action Plan and Ethnic Groups Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  9\nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The  project  is  a  follow-up  to  the  RCDCP.  This  has  the  advantage  that  project \nimplementation mechanisms and capacity have been put in place, and that implementation has \nbeen tested. Regional cooperation requires considerable front-end costs with low immediate \nreturns because of an \u201cincubation period.\u201d However, these costs should be offset by substantial \nbenefits  from  regional  disease  control,  technology  transfer,  and  strengthened  national \ncommitment for health sector development, all of which will have long-term value across the \nregion. Several risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate  Provide training for results-based approach, link investments with results through \nfocus on  AOPs, prepare detailed implementation plans, ensure compliance with GAP and \nachieving  EGP, install provincial training system, and conduct district benefit monitoring and \nresults  evaluation.  \n   For community-based CDC, target the poor and ethnic groups in border districts; \ntrain ethnic staff; use a participatory planning, implementation, and monitoring \napproach; provide logistic support for fieldwork; and demonstrate effectiveness of \ncommunity interventions.  \nWeak  Strengthen PMUs and PIUs, carry out advance action, ensure timely availability of \nimplementation  consultants, and conduct detailed planning of project activities. \ncapacity   For financial management, engage accountants, provide training of provincial \nassistant accountants, and ensure regular supervision and reporting.    \nLengthy  Prepare clear procurement system and procedures, provide staff training and \nadministrative  support of experts and ADB, ensure competent application of procurement \nprocedures   guidelines to minimize delays, and ensure support of core ministries and provinces \nfor timely processing.  \nGovernance  Provide training of PMU and PIUs in ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \nand corruption  amended to date) and government policies, regulations, and guidelines on \nanticorruption; conduct spot-checks of documentation, suppliers, prices, contracts, \nand SOEs; ensure high public visibility of the project; and provide public access to \na complaint and grievance system. \nInsufficient effort  Strengthen the focal point for regional CDC cooperation in each MOH, support \nin regional  WHO in rolling out regional strategies for CDC, improve aid coordination, publish \ncooperation   results, improve visibility of cooperation, and report activities and results to \nregional leaders.    \nNot sustaining  Use appropriate interventions with minimal recurrent costs; ensure mainstreaming \nproject  and funding of project activities in AOPs, including targeting of ethnic groups, \ninvestments  maintaining the provincial training system, and monitoring; and seek \ninstitutionalization and cofinancing of knowledge management.      \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AOP = annual operational plan, CDC = communicable disease control,  \nGAP = gender action plan, EGP = ethnic groups plan, MOH = ministry of health, PIU = project implementation \nunit, PMU = project management unit, SOE = statement of expenditure, WHO = World Health Organization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "10    \nIV.
