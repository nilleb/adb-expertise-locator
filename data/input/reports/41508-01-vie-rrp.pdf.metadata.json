The  project  will  further  enhance \nregional  cooperation  capacity,  expanded \nregional  CDC  systems, \nsurveillance  and  response  systems,  and  targeted  support  for  the  control  of  dengue  and \nneglected tropical diseases (NTDs).2 It will also improve provincial capacity for CDC, including \nstaff training and community-based CDC in border districts. The project will particularly benefit \nthe poor and ethnic groups in border districts, especially women and children.3 \n \n\nimproved \n\nincluding \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nEmerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian \ninfluenza, and swine flu have had major economic impacts on productivity, trade, and tourism in \nthe GMS, and continue to pose a major public health concern. New diseases, mostly of animal \norigin,  also  pose  a  constant  threat.  Dengue,  chikungunya,  cholera,  typhoid,  and  HIV/AIDS\u2014\nfueled  by  better  connectivity,  urban  development,  and  social  and  environment  changes\u2014\ncontinue to spread in the GMS. Controlling these diseases requires strong surveillance systems, \ncommunity prevention and preparedness, and quick system response capacities. \n \n4. \nLeaders  of  the  GMS  have  given  high  priority  to  the  control  of  emerging  diseases,  and \nmore  recently  also  dengue  and  NTDs.  All  GMS  countries  endorse  and  seek  to  implement  the \nnew International Health Regulations (World Health Organization [WHO], 2005) for the reporting \nand containment of outbreaks and disasters of international concern. Several regional strategies \nare  being  rolled  out,  including  the  Asia  Pacific  Strategy  for  Emerging  Diseases  (APSED),  and \nstrategies  for  the  control  of  dengue  and  NTDs.  GMS  governments  are  fully  committed  to \nimplementing these strategies, and to strengthening provincial health systems to support CDC. \nWith  increased  connectivity,  CDC  needs  closer  attention\u2014forecasting,  risk  mitigation,  and \nreinforcing  public  health  fundamentals\u2014so  as  to  contain  transmission  of  and  exposure  to \npathogens, and this requires a multisector approach. However, the immediate need is to contain \nany  new  outbreak.  While  Southeast  Asia  has  been  the  center  of  emerging  diseases, \nsurveillance  and  response  systems,  community  preparedness,  and  health  system  support  in \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam are still not up to the standards of neighboring countries.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and the Socialist Republic of \nViet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project.  Manila  (Grants \n0025-CAM, 0026-LAO, and 0027-VIE, for a total of $30 million). \n\n2   Including Japanese encephalitis, helminthiasis, and schistosomiasis. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nUnder the GMS program, the RCDCP was initiated in 2005 in partnership with the WHO, \n5. \nand  closed  in  2010.  The  ministries  of  health  (MOHs)  are  highly  appreciative  of  the  RCDCP, \nwhich  was  very  timely  with  the  outbreak  of  avian  influenza,  escalation  of  dengue,  and  an \nemerging HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Lao PDR. The RCDCP strengthened provincial surveillance \nand  outbreak  response  capacity  and  provided  provinces  with  a  flexible  response  capacity  to \ndeal with disease outbreaks. Within 36 targeted provinces, the RCDCP also built up provincial \nhealth  systems  capacity  for  CDC.  The  third  output  (regional  capacity  building  for  CDC) \nsupported  regional  cooperation  capacity  and  knowledge  management,  and  harmonizing \nregional  strategies  for  disease  control  and  cross-border  cooperation.  A  regional  coordination \nunit  (RCU)  for  building  regional  coordination  and  knowledge  management,  and  international \nconsultants, were financed through a regional pooled fund managed by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB).  Benefits  of  regional  approaches  are  emerging  in  terms  of  information  exchange, \njoint strategic planning, and cross-border disease control efforts.  \n \n6. \nImportant  lessons  have  been  learned  in  the  RCDCP.  First,  the  RCDCP  experienced \nsome initial delay in Cambodia as it became effective just after the annual budget cycle, and in \nViet  Nam  due  to  staff  constraints  and  lengthy  procurement  procedures.  The  project  will  use \ncurrent  RCDCP  project  management  units  (PMUs)  and  advance  action  to  reduce  start-up \ndelays.  Second,  the  geographic  targeting  of  the  RCDCP  was  not  optimal;  the  project  will \ntherefore  focus  on  border  districts  and  remote  communities.  A  better  prepared  and  resourced \ngender action plan (GAP) and ethnic group plan and better monitoring and evaluation will also \nhelp improve targeting. Third, training activities remained highly centralized; the project will help \nestablish provincial training systems to improve provincial training capacity. Fourth, community-\nbased dengue control was less sustainable, and needs to be improved further with support of \nexperts.  Fifth,  regional  cooperation  and  knowledge  management  were  slow  to  emerge;  the \nproject will help strengthen the institutional capacity of each MOH in these areas.    \n \nThe  project  follows  Strategy  2020,4 which  realigns  ADB's  role  in  the  health  sector  with \n7. \nemphasis  on  regional,  intersector,  and  interagency  cooperation,  as  also  detailed  in  the \noperational  plan  for  health. 5  It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nStrategy,6 the  GMS  regional  cooperation  strategy7 and  the  country  partnership  strategies  and \ncountry operations business plans of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.8 The project supports \nregional  public  goods  and  capacity  towards  regional  health  and  economic  security  and  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for reducing child mortality and malnutrition, halting the \nspread  of  communicable  diseases,  and  others.  In  partnership  with  WHO,  the  Mekong  Basin \nDisease  Surveillance  Cooperation,  the  Kenan  Institute  Asia  and  other  partners,  it  addresses \ncritical funding gaps for the roll-out of the International Health Regulations (2005) and APSED, \nas well as regional strategies for the control of dengue and NTDs. Under the leadership of WHO, \nregional  and  national  aid  coordination  mechanisms  are  in  place  including  regular  meetings, \nsurveys and publications for aid coordination, technical forums, community of practice groups, \nand websites.9   \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2008.

The  expected \nproject  outcome  will  be  timely  and  adequate  control  of  communicable  diseases  of  regional \nrelevance (see Appendix 1 for indicators).   \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nBased  on  achievements  and  lessons  learned  in  the  RCDCP,  three  outputs  have  been \n9. \nformulated: (i) enhanced regional CDC systems, (ii) improved CDC along borders and economic \ncorridors, and (iii) integrated project management.  \n \nThe  first  output  supports  regional  and  national  disease  surveillance  and  control.  The \n10. \nsecond output will focus on 38 provinces10 for capacity building; and 1,160 lagging villages with \na total population of about 1.7 million in 116 border districts for community-based CDC. For the \nsecond output, efforts have been made to make the clusters of targeted provinces contiguous. \nThree  clusters  have  been  identified:  (i)  the  northern  corridor  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  Lao  PDR \nbordering the People\u2019s Republic of China; (ii) the central corridor in central Viet Nam, southern \nLao  PDR,  and  northeast  Cambodia;  and  (iii)  the  southern  corridor  between  Viet  Nam  and \nCambodia, connecting to Thailand.  \n \n11. \nThe  selection  of  provinces  was  based  on  these  having  major  links  with  neighboring \ncountries,  and  being  considered  major  corridors  for  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases. \nPrioritization  of  villages  in  targeted  districts  will  be  based  on  needs,  vulnerability,  connectivity, \nand  feasibility.  At  least  half  of  the  targeted  population  in  the  villages  will  belong  to  ethnic \nminority groups. The third output will support PMUs and project implementation units under the \nadministrative umbrella of the assigned department in each MOH.    \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Enhanced Regional Communicable Disease Control Systems \n\n12. \nImproved  capacity  for  regional  cooperation  in  communicable  disease  control. \nBuilding on the RCDCP, the project will further enhance regional cooperation in CDC to achieve \n(i) improved MOH capacity for regional cooperation in CDC, (ii) coordinated implementation of \nregional strategies, and (iii) sustained knowledge management. The project will strengthen focal \npoints in each MOH for regional CDC coordination and knowledge management; and assist the \nWHO and the ministries to roll out and strengthen regional CDC strategies, including APSED. \nThe project will also support each MOH to participate in regional activities, including the regional \nsteering  committee  and  project  workshops;  and  continue  knowledge  management  activities \ninitiated  under  the  RCDCP,  including  technical  forums  and  community  of  practice  for  dengue, \nJapanese encephalitis, laboratory services, cross-border activities, NTDs, and human resource \ndevelopment. The project will seek regional partnerships for the CDC clearing house and other \nCDC activities such as standard setting and policy-related studies. An RCU based in MOH, the \nLao PDR, will continue to coordinate regional activities and support the knowledge management \nprogram. ADB will manage a small part of the grants for the financing of joint activities.   \n \n13. \nExpanded  surveillance  and  response  systems.  ADB  will  continue  to  support \nprovincial  capacity  for  outbreak  investigation  and  response.  Output  1  will  support  (i)  regional \ncoordination  of  surveillance  and  response  systems,  (ii)  provincial  surveillance  and  response \n\n                                                 \n10 Including  10  provinces  in  Cambodia,  12  in  Lao  PDR,  and  16  in  Viet  Nam  (four  additional  provinces  in  Viet  Nam \n\nsupported during the RCDCP will be phased out during the project).   \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\ncapacity and financing outbreak control, (iii) improving quality of laboratory services, (iv) scaling \nup cross-border cooperation, and (v) improving outbreak reporting systems for major hospitals. \nThe  project  will  seek  partnership  with,  and  if  possible  support,  the  Mekong  Basin  Disease \nSurveillance Cooperation and other partners for cross-border activities.  \n  \n14. \nTargeted  support  for  emerging  and  neglected  diseases.  The  project  will  also \ncontinue  to  provide  targeted  support  for  dengue  and  NTDs,  including  Japanese  encephalitis, \nsoil-transmitted  helminthiasis,  opisthorchiasis,  schistosomiasis,  and  filariasis.  This  will  include   \n(i)  joint  assessments  of  the  spread  and  determinants  of  dengue  and  NTDs  along  economic \ncorridors;  and  (ii)  effective  control  measures  including  behavioral  change  communication, \nequipment, vaccines, and medical supplies.   \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Improved  Communicable  Disease  Control  along  Borders  and \nEconomic Corridors \n \n\n15. \nImproved  community-based  communicable  disease  control.  Border  areas  are  at \nhigher risk of disease outbreaks due to their proximity to borders and economic corridors, while \nat  the  same  time  having  access  problems  combined  with  weak  health  systems  and  less-\ninformed  and  endowed  communities.  Many  of  these  communities  are  ethnic  groups,  new \nsettlements,  or  peri-urban  migrants.  Under  this  sub-output,  the  project  will  target  about  1,160 \npoor,  remote  communities  (on  average  two  per  year  per  district)  with  a  total  estimated \npopulation  of  1.76  million  in  116  border  districts  in  38  provinces\u201416  in  Viet  Nam,  10  in \nCambodia,  and  12  in  the  Lao  PDR.  This  will  include  (i)  training  of  village  health  workers,          \n(ii) participatory assessment and planning, (iii) community  preparedness and school education \ncampaigns, (iv) cross-border cooperation, and (v) accelerated healthy village development.    \n  \n16. \nImproved  staff  capacity  in  communicable  disease  control.  To  improve  provincial \ncapacity on a more sustainable basis, the project will build a provincial training system in each \nof the 38 targeted provinces based on policies, standards, and local potential. This will include \n(i)  setting  up  a  provincial  training  group,  (ii)  improving  human  resources  management,             \n(iii)  developing  a  provincial  in-service  training  system  for  the  sector,  (iv)  improving  staff \nperformance,  and  (v)  reducing  staff  gaps  by  providing  scholarships  for  field  epidemiology  and \nethnic  persons  for  training  as  health  staff.  This  will  require,  among  other  things,  training  of \ntrainers and equipping provincial schools.    \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Integrated Project Management \n\n17. \nThe  third  output  will  support  effective  and  sustainable  project  management  through \nPMUs, project implementation units, and national implementation units under the administrative \numbrella of each MOH subsector program. This includes support for (i) provincial stewardship, \nmanagement  capacity,  and  results-based  management;  (ii)  improving  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, and technical support; and (iii) mainstreaming and sustaining project activities in \nprovincial  annual  operational  plans  including  provincial  training  systems,  special  support  for \nisolated  communities,  compliance  with  social  safeguards,  adequate  recurrent  budget,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $54.00 million including contingencies of $5.60 million. \n\nD. \n \n18. \nThe investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n \n19. \nThe  governments  have  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  total  of  $49  million  in  loan  and \ngrants  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  (90.7%  of  the  project  amount)  to  help  finance  the \nproject: the Government of Viet Nam has requested a loan of $27.0 million with a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement.  The  Government  of  Cambodia  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $10.0  million \nand the Government of the Lao PDR has requested a grant not exceeding $12.0 million (Table \n2).

Each  executing  agency  has \noverall  responsibility  for  in-country  project  implementation  and  coordination  among  countries. \nEach  executing  agency  has  a  project  director  from  among  its  senior  officials  for  project \nmanagement  and  liaison  with  ADB.  National  departments,  institutions,  and  provincial  health \ndepartments are implementing agencies. The RCU will manage a small regional fund of about \n5% of total grant funds drawn from the Cambodia and Lao PDR grants for regional activities and \nsome  international  consulting  services.  Viet  Nam  will  allocate  and  manage  a  similar  amount \nunder  its  loan  for  in-country  regional  workshops  and  international  consulting  services.

The  project  will \nalso  target  about  1.7  million  people  in  1,160  villages  in  116  border  districts,  and  within  these \ndistricts target remote communities. While overall about 31% of the district population belongs \nto  various  ethnic  groups,  the  project  will  aim  for  half  of  the  targeted  population  being  ethnic \nminorities.  These  communities  lag  behind  in  health  indicators,  in  large  part  due  to  common \ninfectious  diseases  including  NTDs.  For  most  NTDs,  highly  cost-effective  interventions  are \navailable,  such  as  vaccines  or  low-cost  medicine.  Bringing  these  diseases  under  control  also \nrequires  cross-border  cooperation.  Some  25%  of  the  people  in  border  districts  will  directly \nbenefit from project investments that will help them progress toward health-related MDGs. The \npoor, women and children will be the major beneficiaries of these community-level interventions.  \n \n22. \nTechnical  challenges  include  (i)  strengthening  regional  cooperation  and  knowledge \nmanagement  for  CDC  on  a  sustainable  basis;  (ii)  accessing  border  districts  and  communities; \n(iii)  community-based  dengue  control;  and  (iv)  integrating  cross-border  cooperation,  training, \nand  social  safeguards  in  provincial  planning  and  budgeting.  The  project  provides  for  capacity \nbuilding and initial support in these areas, and also includes several assurances. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe economic analysis provides the rationale for public sector involvement, a discussion \non provider options, the possible financial effect of the project, expected public sector behavior, \nand an estimated economic internal rate of return of 28%. The benefits of the project will come \nfrom  (i)  helping  prevent  major  epidemics;  (ii) productivity  gains  from  a  reduced  burden  of \ndiseases;  (iii) productivity  gains  from  improved  achievements  in  education,  especially  through \nless  absenteeism  and  reduced  drop  out  rates;  and  (iv)  public  and  private  savings  in  health \nexpenditures, including indirect costs. However, some of these benefits are difficult to measure. \nOnly items (i) and (ii) were considered in the economic internal rate of return.   \n \n24. \nThe  project\u2019s  recurrent  costs  represent  only  a  minor  percentage  of  government  health \nexpenditure  as  a  percentage  of  domestic  spending  on  health\u20140.1%  in  Viet  Nam,  0.3%  in \nCambodia,  and  1.3%  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  figure  for  the  Lao  PDR  is  quite  high  because \ndomestic  spending  is  very  low  at  $1.5  per  person  per  year.  Government  expenditures  for \nrecurrent costs are increasing, indicating future sustainability of the project.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n25. \nEach  MOH  has  gained  substantial  experience  in  implementing  ADB-assisted  projects, \nand has staff with skills and experience in ADB procedures. Arrangements have been made to \nfurther  improve  administrative  and  financial  management  practices.  The  governments  have \ngiven  assurances \n                                                 \n12 For example, the SARS caused widespread social disruption and economic losses. Schools, hospitals, and some \nborders were closed and thousands of people were placed in quarantine. International travel to affected areas fell \nby 50%\u201370%; hotel occupancy dropped by more than 60%. World Health Organization. 2003.

There  were  no  major \ngovernance issues during implementation of the RCDCP, and the same PMUs will be used for \nthe  project.  ADB's  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in \nthe PAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n27. \nThe targeted border districts have a high proportion of families living below or near the \npoverty  line  who  depend  heavily  on  the  availability  of  a  healthy  labor  force  in  the  family.  Any \nserious  disease  or  death  in  the  family  may  throw  the  family  into  even  deeper  poverty, \nmalnutrition,  and  ill  health.  Improved  connectivity  is  facilitating  the  spread  of  communicable \ndiseases  such  as  HIV,  emerging  diseases,  dengue,  and  NTDs.  People  in  border  districts  are \nless informed about these hazards, including trafficking and migrant labor, and have less access \nto  services.  By  helping  improve  regional  health  and  economic  security,  the  project  will  protect \nthe poor against catastrophic events, and improve their health, learning, and productivity. \n \nGender is a significant variable for understanding the spread of communicable diseases, \n28. \nas well as designing and delivering appropriate communicable disease prevention and control. \nWomen  and  girls  have  specific  health  needs  and  are  the  usual  custodians  for  the  prevention, \ndetection,  and  care  of  infectious  diseases  amongst  family  members.  Although  the  majority  of \nhealth  staff  are  often  female,  women  are  more  often  in  lower-level  positions.  Only  Cambodia \nhas a policy of having both female and male village health workers. Increasing gender equity in \nhealth staff will improve CDC outcomes. To ensure the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming \nand  gender-related  outcomes  in  the  project,  each  MOH  will  fully  implement  the  GAP,  key \nfeatures of which are mirrored in the project design and monitoring framework, loan assurances, \nand PAM. The GAP is aligned with national and sector-specific gender equality commitments in \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.13 \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n29. \nEthnic groups constitute 31% of the population in the targeted border districts, most of \nthem  in  the  Lao  PDR.  They  suffer  disproportionately  from  common  communicable  diseases, \nand  have  less  access  to  health  care  because  of  physical,  financial,  language,  and  cultural \nbarriers.  The  project  is  assessed  category  B  for  indigenous  people  and  is  expected  to  have \npositive impacts on ethnic groups. The accrual of benefits to ethnic groups is discussed in the \nethnic  groups  plan,  and  included  in  the  project  design.  Under  the  sub-output  for  community-\nbased  CDC,  the  aim  is  that  50%  of  1,160  targeted  villages  belong  to  ethnic  groups.  This \nincludes  training  of  village  health  workers  and  support  for  healthy  village  development.  The \nproject will also provide scholarships for ethnic group members to become health workers. The \nproject is assessed category C for both environment and involuntary resettlement. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13 Gender Action Plan and Ethnic Groups Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n30. \nThe  project  is  a  follow-up  to  the  RCDCP.  This  has  the  advantage  that  project \nimplementation mechanisms and capacity have been put in place, and that implementation has \nbeen  tested.  Regional  cooperation  requires  considerable  front-end  costs  with  low  immediate \nreturns because of an \u201cincubation period.\u201d However, these costs should be offset by substantial \nbenefits  from  regional  disease  control,  technology  transfer,  and  strengthened  national \ncommitment  for  health  sector  development,  all  of  which  will  have  long-term  value  across  the \nregion.
