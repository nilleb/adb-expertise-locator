The  project  will  assist  PNG  Power \nLimited  (PPL)  in  expanding  renewable  energy  generation,  connecting  currently  unserved \ncustomers,  and  significantly  improving  the  quality  of  electricity  supply.  The  project  will \n(i) upgrade  and  rehabilitate  two  hydropower  plants  (Rouna  1  and  Sirinumu  toe-of-dam); \n(ii) extend  the  grid  to  approximately  3,000  additional  households,  including  strengthening  the \ndistribution  network;  and  (iii)  construct  a  new  substation  (Kilakila)  and  upgrade  the  existing \nsubstations. Project preparatory technical assistance was utilized in project preparation.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nPort  Moresby  is  the  largest  urban  center  in  PNG,  with  a  population  of  318,000  (2011) \nand  is  expanding  rapidly  thanks  to  ongoing  strong  economic  growth.  Port  Moresby  has  the \nlargest  stand-alone power grid  in  PNG,  with  47%  of the  national  installed generation  capacity, \n48% of the national households connected to grid-based electricity, and a peak load of about 97 \nmegawatts  (MW). 3 Load  demand  for  the  Port  Moresby  grid  has  increased  significantly  and \ndemand is expected to keep rising, fuelled by high economic growth related to continued growth \nin the gas and mining sector and associated industries. By 2018, peak demand is anticipated to \nincrease  by  30%  (annual  average  of  6%).  The  Port  Moresby  grid  is  currently  fed  by  diesel \ngeneration (41%) and the Rouna Hydropower Cascade (59%).  \n \nRenewable energy (hydropower) has historically supplied most of the power for the Port \n4. \nMoresby  grid.  In  1994\u20131995,  hydropower  from  the  Rouna  cascade  (installed  capacity  of \n60 MW)4 accounted for 76% of power generation for Port Moresby. By 2010\u20132011 however, due \nto  increasing  demand  and  deferred  rehabilitation  of  the  Rouna  cascade,  the  share  of \nhydropower  in  the  energy  mix  had  fallen  to  59%,  with  diesel  generation  filling  the  gap. 5 \nMaximizing  the  use  of  renewable  energy  (primarily  hydropower)  is  important  to  the  PNG \neconomy,  as  it  (i) reduces  fossil  fuel  imports;  (ii)  lowers  the  cost  of  power  generation  and \nthereby  eases  the  pressure  on  power  tariffs,  which  in  turn  benefits  the  private  sector  and \nreduces  household  expenditure;  and  (iii)  improves  energy  security.  Utilization  of  renewable \nenergy  also  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  which  contribute  to  global  warming.  To  meet \nprojected  medium-  to  long-term  demand  growth,  additional  hydropower  for  the  Port  Moresby \ngrid is to be generated by the Naoro-Brown hydropower project (60 MW). The government is in \nthe  initial  stages  of  assessing  options  for  public\u2013private  partnership  financing  of  the  Naoro-\nBrown  hydropower  project,  supported  by  a  technical  assistance  loan  from  the  World  Bank. \nHowever,  since  large  hydropower  plants  require  long  planning  and  construction  lead  times, \nthere  is  an  urgent  need  for  investments  in  the  Rouna  cascade  to  (i)  secure  immediate \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Port Moresby Grid Development Project. \n\nManila. \n\n3  PPL has 87,772 customers nationwide, of which 41,692 are in Port Moresby.  \n4  Rouna 1: 3.5 MW (rated), Rouna 2: 30 MW (rated), Rouna 3: 12 MW, Rouna 4: 13.2 MW, Sirinumu: 1.5 MW. \n5  Diesel generation involves medium-speed diesel generators at Kanudi (24 MW) and Moitaka (31.2 MW), and gas \n\nturbine peaking units at Kanudi (30 MW) and Moitaka (18 MW) operating on diesel but convertible to gas. \n\n\frehabilitation of the hydropower infrastructure, (ii) meet immediate demand, (iii) offset the need \nfor  further  short-term  investment  in  diesel  generation,  and  (iv)  reduce  reliance  on  high-cost \nimported  fossil  fuels.  Refurbishing  the  existing  infrastructure  is  considered  the  least-cost \noption\u2014the levelized cost of energy from a rehabilitated Rouna 1 hydropower plant is estimated \nat  $0.10\u2013$0.16  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  compared  with  a  levelized  avoided  cost  of  diesel \ngeneration of $0.45/kWh.  \n \n5. \nImproving access to energy is a major developmental priority for PNG. In recognition of \nthe low access rates across the country, the PNG Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030 has \nestablished a national target of 70% access by 2030.6 Increasing access will involve extending \nexisting  grids  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas,  establishing  mini-grids  to  service  isolated  urban \nand rural population centers, and expanding individual power systems such as household solar \nsystems  and  solar  lanterns  for  isolated  households  and  villages.  Expansion  options  hinge  on \nhow power will be utilized and on least-cost delivery. Typically, peri-urban areas have a greater \nneed for grid-connected power due to greater potential for economic activity, while demand from \nrural areas relates to low-usage activities such as lighting and communications. The proposed \nproject focuses on extending the grid to currently unserved areas in urban and peri-urban areas \nof  Port  Moresby.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  also  assisting  access  expansion  to \nprovincial  urban  and  rural  areas,  but  in  separate  interventions.7 The  access  rate  in  urban  and \nperi-urban areas of Port Moresby is estimated at 69%. The project is targeting grid extension to \nan estimated 3,000 low-income households in these areas, which will increase the access rate \nto 74%.  \n \n6. \nLack of access to reliable power is limiting economic growth and hindering private sector \ndevelopment.  A  sample  survey  of  75  households  conducted  under  technical  assistance \nassociated with this project, found that 100% of them experienced frequent disruptions in power \nsupply and extended blackouts. Of the sampled households, 35% were using power to also run \nsmall  businesses.  Improvement  of  power  supply  will  enhance  the  quality  of  life  and  reduce \npoverty  by  encouraging  low-income  families  to  engage  in  small-scale  income  generation \nactivities,  e.g.,  sale  of  cooked  and  refrigerated  items,  and  by  improving  street  illumination  to \nreduce  criminal  activity.  Thus,  investments  in  the  Port  Moresby  grid  transmission  and \ndistribution infrastructure are essential to (i) step up hydropower system efficiencies and reduce \nthe  need for  diesel  power generation,  (ii) reduce  loss of revenue from  high  system  losses, (iii) \nreduce costs to the private sector, and (iv) improve the quality of life of residential customers. \n \n7. \nPower outages on the Port Moresby power grid are becoming more and more frequent. \nThe  average  annual  duration  of  power  outages  per  customer  (customer  average  interruption \nduration index) is 124 hours per annum. This is high compared with the Pacific-wide average of \n10 hours per annum.8 Power disruptions are due to overloaded substations, lack of generation \ncapacity, and non-optimal grid configuration. Because of the unreliability of power supply, there \nis  considerable  self-generation  and  back-up  generation  capacity  in  urban  areas,  which  is \nmaintained and operated at low efficiencies and high cost to businesses. \n \n\n                                                \n6   Government  of  PNG,  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring.  2010.

The  government's  ownership  in  PPL  is  maintained through  the  Independent  Public \nBusiness  Corporation  (IPBC).  Sector  policy  formulation  is  managed  by  the  Department  of \nPetroleum  and  Energy  and,  specifically,  by  the  Energy  Division.  PPL  operates  two  main  grids \n(Port Moresby and Ramu), which are not interconnected, and 26 smaller urban centers through \n19 separate power systems. Power tariffs in PNG are independently regulated by the Consumer \nand Competition Commission and allow full cost recovery for PPL. Electricity tariffs are currently \nK0.8147/kWh ($0.39/kWh) for residential customers with the first 30 kWh/month at a lifeline tariff \nof  K0.4794/kWh  ($0.23/kWh).  Greater  grid  efficiencies  and  replacement  of  diesel  generation \nwith hydropower generation will ease pressure on power tariffs in the medium to long term.  \n \n9. \nThe proposed project is in line with (i) ADB's country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nPNG,9\n  which prioritizes energy as  an area of support, and (ii) the PNG Development Strategic \nPlan,  2010\u20132030  [footnote  6],  which  gives  priority  to  the  improvement  of  power  supply.  The \ngovernment approved the electricity industry policy in 2011, which recognizes the (i) low level of \nelectricity  access,  (ii)  unreliability  of  electricity  supply  and  subsequent  economic  impacts,  (iii) \nhigh costs for the private sector arising from the supply gaps, and (iv) difficulties faced by PPL in \nraising  capital  for  infrastructure  investments.  The  proposed  development  of  the  PNG  power \nsector,  including  the  Port  Moresby  grid,  is  detailed  in  PPL's  15-year  power  development  plan. \nThe outputs of the project are included in PPL's 5-year business plan. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  more  economic  activities  undertaken  by  PPL's  residential  and \n\n10. \nbusiness customers. The outcome will be better power supply for Port Moresby.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe outputs of the project are as follows: \n(i) \n\nHydropower  upgrade  and  rehabilitation.  This  consists  of  (a)  upgrading  the \nRouna  1  hydropower  plant  (6  MW),  and  (b)  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  the \nSirinumu toe-of-dam hydropower plant (1.6 MW). After upgrade and rehabilitation, \nthe  two  plants  will  provide  13%  of  the  renewable  energy,  or  3.6%  of  the  total \nenergy, for the Port Moresby grid.  \nUpgraded  distribution  grid.  This  entails (a) extending the grid to an estimated \n3,000  additional  households, 10  (b)  upgrading  the  existing  11-kilovolt  (kV) \ndistribution  grid, 11  and  (c)  implementing  a  loss  reduction  program. 12  It  is \nestimated  that  the  project  will  connect  5%  more  households  in  Port  Moresby \n(generally from poorer areas) and boost the access rate from 69% to 74%.  \nUpgraded  substation  capacity.  This consists of (a) constructing a new Kilakila \nsubstation, (b) a 6.1-kilometer (km) transmission line (66 kV), and (c) retrofits to \nexisting  substations.  It  is  estimated  that  the  project  (distribution  and  substation \nupgrades)  will  reduce  average  outage  duration  for  customers  by  42%  (by  80% \nwithin the central business district), contributing markedly to better power supply. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                \n9   ADB. 2010.

A PMU will \nbe established within PPL for implementing the project. PPL will provide the following full-time \nPPL staff: (i) two project engineers, (ii) a land officer, (iii) an environment officer, (iv) a finance \nofficer,  (v)  a  procurement  officer,  (vi)  a  surveyor,  (vii)  two  line  engineers,  and  (viii)  an \nadministrative  assistant.  The  project  will  finance  additional  consultants,  equipment,  and  office \nfurnishings to help the PMU implement the outputs. Consulting firms will be engaged using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 (considered justified \ndue to the technical complexity of the power grid upgrades). Consultants may also be recruited \nthrough  individual  consultant  selection  (considered  justified  given  the  difficulties  in  finding \nconsulting companies with the broad technical spread required, and a limited pool of consultants \nwith  required  technical  and  country  expertise).  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended from  time  to  time).  The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  contracting  all  consulting  services,  equipment,  and  civil  works.  A \nproject steering committee will oversee implementation, monitor progress, and provide guidance \nto the executing agency. The committee will meet at least quarterly and will be chaired by the \nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring. PMU will host the steering committee and act \nas the secretariat. \n \n17. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  with  completion  estimated  by  January \n2017.  To  expedite  implementation,  the  government  has  requested  and  ADB  has  approved \nadvance procurement action and retroactive financing for eligible expenditure up to a maximum \nof 18% of the ADF loan and 18% of the OCR loan, incurred before loan effectiveness, but not \nmore  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  ADB  has  informed  the \ngovernment  that  approval  of  advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the project. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table \n3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.13 \n \n\n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2013\u2013January 2017 \nJuly 2017 \n\n7 contracts \n1 contract  \n\nPort Moresby Grid Development Project Steering Committee: \nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring (chair)  \nDepartment of Petroleum and Energy, Department of Treasury, \nIPBC, and PPL (members) \nIPBC \nPPL \nThe  project  management  unit  will  be  established  within  PPL,  with \n10 full-time PPL staff and 12 international consultants (intermittent)  \nICB  \nNational competitive \nbidding  \nShopping \nCQS  \nQCBS  \nICS \nRetroactive financing for up to 18% of ADF and 18% of OCR loan \nproceeds  \nAdvance contracting for ICB, shopping, CQS, QCBS, ICB, and ICS. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB.  \n\n3 contracts \n2 contracts \n91 person-months \n2 contracts  \n\n$95,000 \n$155,000 \n$4,080,000 \n$350,000 \n\n$53,130,000 \n$500,000 \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, ICB = international competitive bidding, \nICS  =  individual  consultant  selection,  IPBC  =  Independent  Public  Business  Corporation,  OCR  =  ordinary  capital \nresources, PPL = PNG Power Limited, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n18. \nThe  proposed  substation  and  distribution  grid  upgrades,  and  the  upgrade  and \nrehabilitation of the hydropower plants have been assessed to be technically viable. Extensive \nmodeling  has  been  completed  to  determine  the  optimum  technical  configuration,  including \nanalysis  of  alternative  substation  locations,  hydropower  turbine  size  configurations,  penstock \narrangements,  and  distribution  configurations  to  maximize  system  efficiencies.  The  project \ndesign  was  based  on  extensive  PNG  experience  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  systems  are \nsuitable  for  local  conditions,  and  the  operation  and  maintenance  requirements  are  compatible \nwith  utility  capacity  to  ensure  sustainable  operation.  Alternative  designs  were  assessed  to \nensure a least-lifecycle-cost design.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the consolidated project is 17.9%, with a \nproject  economic  net  present  value  of  $30.2  million.  This  compares  favorably  with  ADB\u2019s \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The access expansion program, in particular, has a \nhigh  and  robust  EIRR  of  21.9%  that  justifies  the  project  despite  the  low  financial  viability  of \nsome project elements (Table 4).  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n20. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  the  consolidated  project  is  10.2%,  with  a \nproject financial net present value of $146.2 million. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.0%  and  indicates  that  the  project  as  a  whole  is  financially \nsustainable. \n \n\n Table 4: Financial Analysis Summary  \n\nFIRR  \n(%) \n\nFNPV \n($ million) \n\nEIRR  \n(%) \n\nENPV \n($ million) \n\nComponent \n\nOutput 1: Hydropower upgrade and rehabilitation \n\n1.

A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  account  for  increases  in \neconomic  and  financial  costs,  as  well  as  a  reduction  of  economic  and  financial  benefits.  Both \nFIRR and EIRR are robust to cost increase and benefit reduction.14  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management. A financial management assessment was completed for PPL, \n22. \nincluding a review of the accounting and reporting system, internal and external auditing, fund \ndisbursement,  and  information  system.15 The  assessment  indicated  that  while  PPL's  financial \nmanagement  is  generally  satisfactory,  improvements  could  be  made  in  the  areas  of  internal \ncontrol  relating  specifically  to  account  reconciliation  procedures,  prevention  of  re-statement  of \naccounts  at  regular  intervals,  and  integration  of  systems  into  the  Oracle-based  accounting \nsystem.  PPL  is  now  dealing  with  these  issues,  and  they  are  not  anticipated  to  impact  PPL's \nmanagement of the project. Design and supervision consultants will provide support.  \n \n23. \nProcurement capacity. A procurement capacity assessment was completed for PPL. It \nindicated  that  PPL  has significant  experience procuring goods  and  services  and has  sufficient \nprocurement experience and human resources to manage procurement for the project, including \nthe  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  evaluation  of  technical  proposals,  and  monitoring  of \ncontract  performance.  The  assessment  found  some  areas  that  require  realignment  to  comply \nwith  ADB  systems:  (i)  lack  of  specific  technical  specification  or  bill  of  quantities  and  price \n                                                \n14 A more detailed description of the parameters considered is in the Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (both \n\naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n15 ADB.  2005.

Based  on  this  risk  evaluation,  the  PMU  will  include  an \ninternational procurement specialist who will train PPL staff in preparing tender documents and \nmanaging  the  preparation  of  ADB  tender  documents.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  IPBC,  and  PPL.  The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration  manual.  PPL\u2019s  asset  management  procedures  were  assessed  and  considered \nsufficient to operate and maintain the assets under the project.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n24. \nSocial. The project aims to connect 3,000 households out of an estimated 17,800 non-\nconnected  households  in  the  poorer  peri-urban  villages  of  Port  Moresby.  Access  to  electricity \nwill  (i)  reduce  household  chores  such  as  collecting firewood,  which is mainly  done  by  women; \n(ii)  replace  kerosene  lighting  with  a  cheaper  form  of  energy,  thereby  freeing  household \nexpenditure;  (iii)  improve  children's  education;  and  (iv) reduce  indoor  health  and  safety  issues \nassociated  with  burning  firewood  and  kerosene.  The  project  is  also  expected  to  provide  more \nreliable power supply to broader residential areas, including poor areas in Port Moresby. Better \npower  supply  will  enhance  the  quality  of  life  of  Port  Moresby  residents  by  (i)  reducing  now-\nregular  power  outages  for  residents;  (ii)  encouraging  low-income  families  to  engage  in  small-\nscale income generation activities such as selling cooked and refrigerated items, which is now \nnot possible due to regular extended power outages; (iii) improving street illumination to reduce \ncrimes;  and  (iv)  improving  the  water  supply  to  residents,  which  is  disconnected  during  regular \nextended power outages.  \n \n25. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  a  gender \naction  plan  has  been  prepared  for  project  implementation  and  monitoring.  Gender  actions \ninclude (i) prioritizing households headed by women for connection to the grid; (ii) undertaking \ntraining  workshops  in  newly  connected  communities  (at  least  50%  female  participation)  on \nelectricity  safety,  operation  of  prepayment  meters,  energy  efficiency,  and  household  utility \nbudgeting;  (iii)  conducting  training  workshops  in  five  communities  (at  least  50%  female \nparticipation)  on  using  electricity  for  income  generation;  (iv)  fostering  women's  participation  in \ncommunity  consultations  (at  least  40%);  (v)  including  at  least  one  woman  on  the  grievance \nredress  mechanism  committee;  (vi)  requiring  contractors  to  pay  equal  wages  to  men  and \nwomen for work of equal value, providing female workers with sanitation facilities, and including \nwomen in labor-based work (at least 20% women workers); (vii) ensuring that women\u2019s wages \nare paid directly to them; (viii) conducting gender awareness training for contractors, the PMU, \nand PPL management; and (ix) including an international social and gender specialist to support \nthe PMU.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nEnvironment.  The  project  overall  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  has \nbeen  prepared  for  each  component.  The  main  potential  environmental  impacts  will  arise  from \nland  clearing,  earthworks,  dust,  noise,  tree  trimming,  sourcing  and  transportation  of  materials, \nconstruction  traffic,  waste disposal  and discharges,  cleaning  and refurbishment  of  hydropower \nplants,  and  minor  upgrade  of  an  access  road.  The  results  of  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations will be integrated into the bidding documents for each component and if there are \nscope  changes,  an  updated  environmental  examination  and  environmental  management  plan \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fwill  be  compiled  by  the  PMU  and  approved  by  ADB.  As  part  of  the  assessment,  a  climate \nchange adaptation risk evaluation was conducted and considered in the infrastructure design.16 \n \n27. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  does  not  involve  physical  displacement  of  people  or \nstructures,  but  requires  acquisition  of  about  5.47  hectares  of  customary  land  for  the  new \nsubstation and transmission line, affecting 198 families (744 individuals). A land acquisition and \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  new  substation  and  transmission  line  site.  A  due \ndiligence  report  has  been  prepared  for  existing  sites  (including  Rouna  1  hydropower  and \nSirinumu  toe-of-dam  hydropower).  PPL  will  update  and finalize  the  resettlement  plan  and  due \ndiligence  report  prior  to  project  implementation.  PPL  will  coordinate  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  activities  with  government  and  nongovernment  agencies.  Due  diligence  carried \nout under project preparatory technical assistance has confirmed that there will be no impact on \ndistinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples. Consultation with affected persons has been carried \nout  during  project  preparation.  The  draft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  has  been \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  All  updated  safeguard  documents  will  be  endorsed  by  the \ngovernment, disclosed to affected persons and local stakeholders and posted on ADB website. \nThe project will support capacity within PPL to manage safeguard aspects through international \nand national environment and social safeguard specialists, who will be working within the PMU. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.17 The  risks  have  been  assessed  and  the \nbenefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n  \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nShortage of civil works contractors. Construction \ncompanies may be reluctant to bid for projects. \n\nLack of technical capacity of local contractors, e.g., \ndistribution line construction. \n\nLandowner disputes delay implementation, \nincluding concerns in Rouna 1 and Sirinumu.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe PMU will conduct outreach activities to attract \npotential bidders, including advertisements on the \nADB website, UN Development Business and \nLinkedIn ADB Suppliers network. \nPPL will (i) assume responsibility for works on \ntargeted contracts and (ii) bundle distribution line \nconstruction projects to develop technical capacity \namong local contractors. \nThe PMU will include international and national \nconsultants to help implement the stakeholder \nconsultation and participation plan, and monitor the \ndevelopment package for the adjacent \ncommunities. PPL will ensure adequate \ncompensation to landowners, meaningful ongoing \nconsultation, and an effective grievance redress \nmechanism.  \nSufficient budget will be allocated to ensure that the \nPMU will be adequately equipped with PPL staff \nand international consultants.   \n\nStaffing of the PMU is not sufficient to manage \nproject implementation adequately. \n\n                                                \n16 Application  for  Clean  Development  Mechanism  financing  is  not  considered  warranted  due  to  the  relatively  low \n\nprojected revenue from carbon dioxide emission reductions.  \n\n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nPoor technical input during specification \npreparation leads to technical failure.  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe PMU will be adequately equipped with PPL \nstaff and international consultants to prepare \nsatisfactory technical specifications for tendering.  \n\nPMU = project management unit, PPL = PNG Power Ltd, UN = United Nations. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government, IPBC, and PPL have assured ADB that implementation of the project \n29. \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents.
