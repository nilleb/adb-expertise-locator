(Maculus II). \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE \n\nMacro- and Microeconomic Background and Rationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nIn  the  early  1990s,  Asia  experienced  explosive  capital  inflows.  Attracted  by  the  Asian \nmiracle, Japanese and Korean banks (which accounted for over 55% of all credit provided to the \nAsian  private  sector),  along  with  European  and  US  investors,  bought  Asian  loans  and  bonds. \nCoincidently, the domestic private sector was taking full advantage of these countries\u2019 pegged \ncurrencies and the advantages of foreign versus local borrowing costs available at the time. In \nJuly  1997,  following  a  period  of  slowing  exports,  rising  current  account  deficits,  and  depleted \ncentral  bank  reserves,  Asian  currencies  unpegged  from  the  US  dollar,  creating  a  systemic \nfinancial  collapse.  Par-based  lenders  faced  mounting  portfolio  losses,  weak  bankruptcy  codes \nand legal enforcement, poor legislative and judiciary protection, and no secondary market. The \nresult was substantial amounts of nonperforming loans (NPLs), both official and unofficial, as a \npercentage of total loans.  \n \n3. \nMarket  estimates  are  that  one  to  two  thirds  of  all  loans  provided  in  Asia\u2014outside \nJapan\u2014are considered delinquent. This amounts to over $400 billion, at minimum of distressed \nassets in Asia (Figure 1).   \n \n\nHong Kong, China/\nPRC\n$307\n\nIndia\n$29.9\n\nThailand\n$19.1\n\nIndonesia\n$16.9\n\nFigure 1: Total Distressed Debt, Asia (except Japan) \n($ billion) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTaipei,China\n$19.1\n\nPhilippines\n$9.0\n\nRep.

Up to $200,000 will be used for interest on ADB\u2019s pro rata \n\nportion of the drawdown prior to ADB\u2019s funding.  \n\n\f2 \n\n  \n \n \n\n  \n\nMany of these distressed companies are struggling while talks with creditors continue to \n4. \nstall.  In  many  cases,  the  lack  of  progress  stems  from  a  complete  breakdown  of  trust  and \nunderstanding between different creditor groups, borrowers, management, and shareholders. In \nan  environment  where  the  legal  system  is  frequently  neither  robust  nor  creditor-friendly, \nnegotiated  settlement  is  key.  However,  with  mistrust  prevailing,  negotiated  settlements  are \nunlikely  to  start  or  succeed.  Until  this  distressed  debt  problem  is  cleared,  the  companies \nconcerned cannot grow or borrow. \n \nRestructuring  of  these  distressed  companies  could  be  much  improved  by  having  a \n5. \nsource  of  capital  to  buy  out  existing  creditors  (take-out  capital).  Once  trust  is  broken,  in  most \ncases,  creditors  value  cash  much  more  highly  than  any  term-restructured  solution.  Once  a \ncompany  has  gone  into  financial  distress,  capital  to  finance  such  restructuring  is  extremely \ndifficult  to  find  as  (i)  banks  tend  not  to  lend  to  companies  in  default,  (ii)  hedge  funds  are \nreluctant  to  step  into  complex  situations  where  they  are  unfamiliar  with  local  laws  and \npersonalities, (iii) mezzanine debt2 and other capital providers demand too high a price on their \ninvestments, and (iv) original shareholders and their supporters are reluctant to show the value \nof their assets in case creditors seize them. \n \n6. \nMaculus  II  will  bridge  this  gap  and  take  out  certain  creditor  groups  to  initiate  sensible \nfinancial  and/or  corporate  restructuring  of  the  investee  portfolio  companies.  Maculus  II  will  not \ninterfere in running the portfolio companies and will restrict itself to facilitating rehabilitation and \nfinancial restructuring. However, Maculus II will seek to offer more benefit to portfolio companies \nthan  other  market  investors.  For  example,  it  may  aim  to  obtain  the  right  to  advise  portfolio \ncompanies on restructuring terms or name people associated with its general partner to portfolio \ncompany boards, or creditor and/or restructuring committees. If new management is required, a \npool  of  resources  is  available  and  well  known  to  the  general  partner.  Maculus  II\u2019s  overall \ninvestment  philosophy  will  be  to  maximize  investor  returns  over  the  medium  to  long  term  by \nadding value as an active investor in the portfolio companies. \n \n7. \nDisgruntled  and  frustrated  creditors  are  often  willing  to  give  up  some  attainable  gains. \nThis is reflected in the sharp upward swing often seen in company share prices when they are \nrehabilitated.  \n \n8. \nMaculus II will foster and build on the existing signs that debtors and creditors are willing \nto  work  toward  mutually  beneficial  solutions.  Some  driving  forces  behind  this  acceleration  are \nthe recent rise in local stock markets, improved economic growth, under-leveraged banks, and \nlow interest rates. \n \nB. \n\nPublic Sector Country Strategies and Interventions of the Asian Development \nBank \n\n \n9. \nADB\u2019s proposed investment in Maculus II will build on its strategy of helping developing \nmember  countries  tackle  the  burden  of  distressed  assets  and  NPLs  and  build  a  sound  and \nefficient financial sector. For example, in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), ADB helped the \nCinda Asset Management Corporation (Cinda) deal with NPLs. ADB technical assistance (TA)3 \nwas  given  immediately  after  Cinda  was  established  to  (i)  provide  the  asset  management \ncompany  (AMC)  with  the  technology  to  complete  its  mandate  to  undertake  financial  and \n\n \n                                                \n2  Mezzanine debt is repayable only after other debt with higher ranking has been satisfied, but before equity is paid. \n3   ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Institutional Strengthening of the Cinda \n\nAsset Management Company. Manila (TA 3303-PRC). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n \n \n\ncorporate  restructuring  of  companies  whose  assets  were  foreclosed,  (ii)  equip  Cinda  with  the \nlatest techniques used for purchase and disposition of NPLs to achieve sufficient returns from \nfunds  injected  to  acquire  NPLs,  and  (iii)  help  Cinda  implement  appropriate  management \ninformation  systems.  The  TA  has  quickly  established  Cinda  operationally  and  provided  broad \nrecommendations on various legal and regulatory issues to policy makers in the Government of \nthe PRC. A second TA for Cinda to help develop asset-backed securities is being approved. In \nIndia,  ADB  provided  a  TA  to  enable  and  structure  asset  reconstruction  companies.4  In  the \nprivate sector, ADB has been involved in projects with (i) ADM Maculus I, (ii) Yangtze Special \nSituations Fund (PRC), (iii) financing the purchase of nonperforming mortgages by a Deutsche \nBank  AG-managed  fund  from  National  Home  Mortgage  Finance  Corporation  (Philippines),  (iv) \nfinancing  the  purchase  of  an  NPL  portfolio  from  PCI  Equitable  Bank  by  Bayerische \nHypovereinsbank  AG  (Philippines),  and  (v)  formation  of  Actis  Asset  Reconstruction  Company \n(India).  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED FUND \n\nObjectives \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n10.  Maculus II is a successor fund of Maculus I, in which ADB invested $20 million of a total \nof $138 million in 2004.5 The establishment of Maculus II follows the rapid deployment of capital \nof Maculus I. Maculus II will build upon the success of the first fund and its strategy. \n \nB. \n \nThe objectives of Maculus II are to (i) mobilize foreign capital flows to financially troubled \n11. \nbut  potentially  viable  companies  throughout  Asia;  (ii)  catalyze  the  financial  restructuring  and \nrehabilitation of these companies to (a) optimize their asset and capital utilization; (b) revitalize \ncorporate  growth  and  increase  competitiveness;  (c)  increase  profitability,  employment,  and \nemployee  well-being;  and  (d)  introduce  industry,  management,  environmental,  and  corporate \ngovernance best practices more widely in the region; and (iii) achieve a demonstration effect, as \nMaculus  II\u2019s  transactions  will  have  a  multiplier  effect  by  creating  replicable  (best  practice) \nrestructuring models for Asia\u2019s emerging markets. \n \nC. \n\nConcept and Strategic Rationale  \n\n12.  Maculus II will invest primarily in the capital structure (securities, loans, equity, or other \nassets) of potentially viable, listed, or unlisted companies that are financially distressed because \nof excessive debt and/or inappropriate capital and financial structure. These companies are at \nrisk  of  bankruptcy  (i.e.,  liquidation  with  full  labor  retrenchment)  unless  financially  restructured. \nMaculus II, through its investment in the portfolio companies, will assist such restructuring. \n \n13.  Maculus  II  will  use  the  best-known  global  practices  and  experienced  professionals  to \ncreate  opportunities  for  capital  appreciation  through  repositioning,  rehabilitation,  development, \nand intensive management of distressed or underperforming assets. It will seek attractive risk-\nadjusted returns by exploiting interim inefficiencies in the market for NPLs and will capitalize on \nthe expertise of its sponsors in managing distressed assets. \n \n                                                \n \n4  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Developing  the  Enabling  Environment  for  and  Structuring  Asset \n\nReconstruction Companies in India. Manila (TA 3943-IND). \n\n5  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  for  ADM  Maculus  Fund  L.P. \n\nFund. Manila (REG 7195).  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n  \n \n \nThe two major sources of distressed assets are governments and banks. Governments \n14. \nthroughout Asia have attempted to rationalize and strengthen their banking systems, leading to \nthe creation of state-sponsored AMCs in some of Maculus II\u2019s targeted countries. The primary \ntask  of  AMCs  is  to  take  nonperforming  assets  from  undercapitalized  banks  and  sell  them  to \ninvestors  at  market  prices.  Other  banks  have  performed  their  own  ad  hoc  sales  of  distressed \nassets through public auctions and private negotiated sales with end buyers. \n \n15. \nUntil  recently,  most  domestic  institutions  have  been  unable  or  unwilling  to  write  down \nNPLs to market prices because of their weak capital positions. Financial institutions and AMCs, \nhowever,  have  become  increasingly  aggressive  in  selling  distressed  assets.  Banking  reforms \nand tax changes are the primary motivation for sale of assets, not economic value. Increasing \ngovernment  pressure  or  incentive  creation  (as  in  India,  Philippines,  and  PRC)  and  renewed \ninterest in equity markets have given banks further incentives to absorb such losses, and hence \nsell NPLs. Foreign institutions\u2014financial and trade\u2014once again see new lending or trade as a \ngrowth  area.  Dealing  with  NPLs  or  bad  debt  is  seen  as  a  distraction  to  management  and \npotentially negative for new business. Private negotiation and careful structuring often provide a \nrich pool of assets for distressed asset buyers. \n \nD. \n\nOperational and Investment Plan  \n\nADM is involved in ongoing discussions with several attractive investment opportunities. \n16. \nGiven ADM\u2019s rapid deployment of funds, the investment manager can apply lessons learned in \nMaculus  I  to  strengthen  its  deal  sourcing  and  execution  abilities.  There  are  significant \ninvestment  opportunities  in  Indonesia,  Thailand,  and  the  Philippines,  where  ADM  has  built \nstrong  relationships  and  refined  its  understanding  of  complex  local  laws  and  regulations.  In \naddition to these markets, ADM has indicated that it will also target investments in Viet Nam, Sri \nLanka, and Pakistan. \n \nAlthough  competition  in  the  distressed  debt  arena  is  expected  to  increase  because  of \n17. \ndemand for higher yields from an increasing number of investors, ADM has differentiated itself \nfrom  the  competition  since  it  specializes  in  Asian  distressed  debt  (excluding  Japan)  while  its \ncompetitors  have  more  of  a  global  focus.  It  is  expected  that  ADM  will  continue  to  enjoy  a \ncompetitive position in the Asian market by concentrating its decision makers in the region and \nbuilding on a long track record of innovative solutions. \n \nE. \n \n18.  Maculus II is denominated in US dollars, established in the Cayman Islands, and is an \nexempted limited partnership.6 Its term is 5 years from the date of closing, but may be extended \nfor up to two consecutive 1-year periods at the discretion of the general partner.  \n \n\nStructure and Size  \n\n                                                \n \n6  The  selection  of  the  Cayman  Islands  as  the  legal  domicile  is  in  line  with  international  practice  for  private  equity \nfunds  to  structure  such  a  vehicle  most  efficiently.  Various  ADB-sponsored  funds  have  been  established  in  this \njurisdiction.  The  Cayman  Islands  were  chosen  because  Maculus  II  can  obtain  permanent  tax  exemption,  thus  it \nprovides  a  tax-efficient  domicile.  The  Cayman  Islands\u2019  legal  system  is  based  on  English  law,  therefore  the  legal \nconcepts  are  familiar  to  many  investors  in  developed  countries.  The  Cayman  Islands  have  also  significantly \nimproved their anti-money-laundering regulations in recent years and have been removed from the Financial Action \nTask  Force  on  Money  Laundering  list  of  non-cooperative  countries.  The  limited  partnership  agreement  includes \nanticorruption,  anti-money-laundering,  and  anti-terrorism  provisions  requiring  the  general  partner  and  ADM  (as \ninvestment manager) to institute and maintain internal control procedures to prevent Maculus II from being involved \nin any money-laundering scheme, fraud, or other corrupt activity.  \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n \n \n\nSponsor  \n\nADB\u2019s commitment will be up to $25 million or 25% of paid-up capital (whichever is less). \n19. \nADB will not be the largest investor in Maculus II. The limited partners\u2019 participation in Maculus \nII is covered under the limited partnership agreement, which has been fully negotiated and is in \nline with market practice and ADB standards. \n \nF. \n \n20. \nADM  is  the  sponsor  of  Maculus  II,  and  will  be  its  investment  manager  and  main \nshareholder  of  the  general  partner.  ADM  has  developed  a  strong  track  record  identifying  and \nsuccessfully  realizing  value  from  distressed  debt  opportunities  in  Asia,  and  is  one  of  Asia\u2019s \nleading  specialist  managers  of  Asian  distressed  assets.  ADM  was  founded  in  1996  to  provide \nstructured  financing  advice  to  government  and  corporate  borrowers  throughout  Asia.  In  1998, \nADM  Hong  Kong  Limited  (ADM's  Hong  Kong,  China-based  entity)  became  a  licensed \ninvestment manager registered by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. ADM is \nowned by its founders and directors.  \n \nSince  its  inception,  ADM  has  turned  over  in  excess  of  $3  billion  in  face  value  of \n21. \ndistressed  debt  and  has  been  directly  involved  in  restructuring  over  $2  billion  in  distressed \nassets.  ADM\u2019s  key  personnel  have  extensive  experience  in  Asia,  Asian  distressed  debt \nmanagement,  capital  mobilization,  and  asset  restructuring.  Since  its  formation,  ADM  has \ndeveloped  a  close  network  of  well-connected  local  partners  and  joint  ventures  in  Indonesia, \nRepublic of Korea, Philippines, and Thailand to source deal opportunities and obtain an in-depth \nunderstanding of local market conditions.  \n \nADM has developed a strong track record in Asia identifying and successfully realizing \n22. \nvalue  from  distressed  debt  opportunities.  ADM  has  received  several  awards  for  the  Galleus \nFund,  including  the  top  Asian  fund  in  Asian  Investor  Magazine\u2019s  hedge  funds  All  Strategies \ncategory  (2002  and  2003).  ADM  manages  over  $220  million  in  Asian  distressed  debt,  $450 \nmillion in two passive collateralized bond obligation and equity warrant pools sponsored by the \nKorean Government, and $50 million in other funds. \n \nG. \n\nEligible Instruments  \n\n23.  Maculus  II  will  invest  in  single  credit  situations,  mostly  through  direct  purchase  of  debt \n(securities or loans) and, to a lesser extent, equity issued by troubled Asian companies and NPL \nportfolios.  \n \n24. \nThe  geographical  focus  of  Maculus  II\u2019s  investments  will  be  selected  ADB  developing \nmember countries where restructuring of the banking and corporate sector is at an early stage. \nTo diversify, Maculus II will invest no more than 35% of aggregate capital commitments in any \none  country  and  no  more  than  15%  of  aggregate  capital  commitments  in  any  one  portfolio \ncompany.  \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n  \n \n \n\nH. \n\nOperational Arrangements \n\nGeneral Partner \n\n1. \n  \nADM  Maculus  Investments  II  Limited  has  been  incorporated  in  the  Cayman  Islands  to \n25. \nserve  as  general  partner  to  Maculus  II.  Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  limited  partnership \nagreement, Maculus II has delegated to ADM (as investment manager) complete and exclusive \nresponsibility for all management and investment decisions made on behalf of Maculus II. The \ndirectors of the general partner are Robert Appleby, Chris Botsford, and Denys Firth.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Manager  \n\n \nThe  general  partner  has  appointed  ADM  as  the  investment  manager  of  Maculus  II, \n26. \npursuant to an investment management agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, all the \ngeneral  partner\u2019s  responsibilities  in  connection  with  sourcing  and  management  of  Maculus  II \n(including investment decisions) have been delegated to ADM. ADM is registered with the Hong \nKong Securities and Futures Commission.  \n \n\n3. \n\nAdvisory Board \n\n \n27.  Maculus  II  has  an  advisory  board  established  by  the  general  partner,  consisting  of \nrepresentatives  of  the  investment  manager  and  certain  limited  partners  (including  ADB).  The \nboard will meet regularly and have responsibility for (i) reviewing the investment decisions of the \ninvestment  manager;  (ii)  reviewing  the  annual  accounts  of  Maculus  II;  (iii)  reviewing  and \nresolving conflicts of interest issues, if any; and (iv) any other matters specifically delegated to \nthem by the general and/or limited partners. ADB will retain the right to appoint one person to \nthe advisory board of Maculus II, who may or may not be an ADB staff member. \n \n\n4. \n\nInvestment Committee \n\n \n28. \nconsist of the general partner\u2019s three directors and four other members. \n\nThe investment committee of Maculus II will be appointed by the general partner and will \n\nEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment  \n\n \n29. \nThe  investment  committee  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving \ninvestments and divestments of Maculus II, and the general partner will act in accordance with \nthe  instructions  of  the  investment  committee.  The  committee  will  meet  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  as \nneeded. \n \nI. \n \n30. \nThe  general  partner  will  ensure  that  all  drawdown  notices  issued  to  ADB  include \nconfirmation  that  the  proposed  use  of  funds  complies  with  ADB's  policies  on  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous people. ADB will have the right to decline participation \nin  any  investment  that  it  determines  would  violate  any  ADB  policy  (or  be  among  ADB\u2019s \nprohibited activities). \n \n31. \n \n32. \nThe  general  partner  and  the  investment  manager  have  implemented  environmental \nmanagement  system  (EMS)  guidelines  for  Maculus  I,  which  were  received  and  reviewed  by \n\nThe project is classified by ADB as a financial intermediary (FI). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n \n \n\nADB in September 2005. PSOP has confirmed that the EMS guidelines have been in put into \npractice successfully during the investment period for Maculus I over the past year. Parallel to \nthe financial appraisal, the investment manager\u2019s analysts carry out environmental due diligence \nbefore  submitting  a  transaction  to  the  investment  committee  (if  necessary,  using  external \nconsultants).  Environmental  concerns  have  been  satisfactorily  addressed  for  all  investments \nmade in the past year in Maculus I\u2014confirmed during ADB's due diligence. The system in place \nhas been fully documented and is considered appropriate for Maculus II. However, the general \npartner  and  investment  manager  have  been  required  to  undergo  ADB-sponsored  or  approved \nenvironmental training, when the training becomes available.  \n \n33. \n \n\nThe following framework will guide Maculus II for each investment: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nADM will identify certain investment opportunities. \n \nMaculus II will make an initial investment (expected to be less than $1 million) in \nthe  portfolio  company  to  gain  access  to  creditor  privileged  information.  Before \nmaking such initial investment, the general partner and investment manager will \nverify (to the best of their knowledge) that the opportunity is not on the prohibited \nactivity  list.  In  the  case  of  investments  made  through  secondary  market \npurchases  (i.e.,  purchases  of  existing  debt),  the  investment  will  be  permitted \nprovided  the  investee  company  is  not  substantially  involved  in  any  prohibited \nactivity. New money investments (i.e., investments made through a new issue of \nnew equity or debt by the investee company) in a conglomerate will be permitted \nif  the  general  partner  or  investment  manager  obtains  specific  assurances  from \nthe investee company that the proceeds of the new money investment will not be \nused in any prohibited activity. \n\n(iii) \n\nMaculus II will make best reasonable efforts not to make new money investments \nin investee companies whose operations do not comply with ADB policies, unless \nsuch investee company has adopted and complies with ADB policies, except as \npermitted in (ii) above. \n\n \n(iv)  Maculus  II  will  make  best  reasonable  efforts  not  to  make  any  new  money \ninvestments  in  any  investee  company  that  conducts  or  intends  to  conduct  an \nactivity classified as a category-A project or category-B sensitive project\u2014unless \nthe  general  partner  has  received  prior  written  confirmation  from  ADB  that  such \nproject  complies  with  ADB  policies,  or  the  investee  company  has  adopted  and \ncomplies with ADB policies, except as permitted in (ii) above. \n\n(v) \n\nADM  will  carry  out  further  research  on  the  investment  opportunity  as  a  creditor \nand make an investment (if the outcome is positive) by (a) providing fresh capital \n(debt  or  equity)  to  the  portfolio  company,  or  (b)  purchasing  further  amounts  of \nexisting loans/bonds.  \n\n \nEMS Procedures for New Money Investments.

Maculus  II\u2019s  objective  in  restructuring  distressed  asset  would \nhelp  deliver  development  impact  on  four  fronts,  each  as  described  below:  (i)  entrusted \nrelationship,  (ii)  employment  preservation,  (iii)  efficiency  promotion,  and  (iv)  expansion \nopportunity. In assisting corporate restructuring, Maculus II will address a key weakness in the \nbanking sector that, if left unchecked, may limit continued economic growth. Equity investments \nin funds are an established intervention by the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD).  \n \n36. \nFirst,  given  the  contentious  nature  of  distressed  debt  resolution  and  the  ensuing \ncorporate restructuring, attaining an entrusted relationship among parties is crucial to implement \nthe  process.  With  ADB  as  an  \u201chonest  broker\u201d  shareholder  in  Maculus  II,  ensuring  a  suitable \ncode  of  conduct  with  regard  to  Maculus  II\u2019s  interaction  with  distressed  clients,  the  target \ndistressed  firm  and  original  creditors  will  gain  comfort  in  engaging  dialogue  with  Maculus  II  to \nconsider  and  execute  the  resolution  plan.  Second,  by  providing  needed  capital  and  a \nrestructuring  plan  to  the  distressed  client,  Maculus  II  will  directly  help  the  client  revitalize  its \nbusiness,  which  will  result  in  long-term  employment  preservation,  and  even  expansion,  within \nthe client firm. Third, such capital infusion from Maculus II will allow the client firm to refocus on \nits  operations  (rather  than  be  distracted  by  avoiding  and  negotiating  with  defaulted  creditors). \nThis will result in improved operational efficiency for the previously distressed firm. Finally as a \nresult of the restructuring capital and increased efficiency, the client firm could seize expansion \nbusiness opportunities to grow its business. \n \n37. \nOn a macro level, accelerating the Asian restructuring process is key to (i) regenerating \nregional  growth,  (ii)  preserving  investments  in  companies  or  projects,  and  (iii)  reestablishing \nconfidence  so  that  new  investors  will  step  forward  to  finance  the  continuing  massive \ninfrastructure  needs.  Restructuring  gives  the  finance  provider  some  ability  to  ensure  that \ncontrols, environmental standards, and corporate governance procedures are implemented and \nadhered to. The leverage in the debt restructuring process far exceeds the level of control of a \nprivate equity or other participant in corporate investment structures. For Asia as a whole, the \npresence of large numbers of defaulted companies weighs heavily on the banking and financial \nsystem.  Even  where  bad  debts  have  been  sold  or  transferred  to  AMCs,  the  large  numbers  of \ndistressed companies dampen the economy as they are relatively unproductive. In some cases, \nclosure may be the optimum solution, but in most cases the underlying companies continue to \n\n \n\n \nJ. \n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n \n \n\nbe  productive  and  recover  strongly  once  the  weight  of  bad  debt  is  removed.  This  is  a  direct \nresult  of  the  cause  of  bad  debt  which,  in  many  cases,  was  effectively  currency  speculation, \nalthough many companies were unaware of this at the time. \n \nThe Asian development experience has shown that economic growth is one of the most \n38. \npowerful weapons in the fight against poverty. Growth creates the need for labor, the main asset \nof  the  poor.  As  growth  continues,  private  sector  employment  becomes  the  major  source  of \neconomic support for most workers and their families. Economic growth also increases the tax \nbase, enabling governments to finance social services such as health and education.7  \n \n39. \nIndirectly, Maculus II addresses the inherent weaknesses of the banking industry in Asia. \nCorporate  structuring  is  crucial  to  restore  the  health  of  the  banking  industry  in  the  targeted \ncountries,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  after  the  1997  financial  crisis.  The \nvulnerability  of  the  banking  system and  the  economy  is  a  result  of  rapid  growth  that  outpaced \nthe  establishment  of  sound  regulation,  building  of  institutional  capacities,  and  formulation  of \nsound  corporate  governance  principles.  The  development  of  a  sound  and  efficient  financial \nsector  is  a  prerequisite  for  broad-based  private  sector-led  economic  development  that  will \nreduce poverty. Failure to solve the NPL problem will result in a further drain of resources and \npotential earnings, and will significantly impair capital. As credit costs increase to cover the cost \nof  NPL  losses,  financial  institutions  are  reluctant  to  make  fresh  loans.  Tighter  credit  restricts \neconomic  growth,  as  enterprises  are  unable  to  access  capital.  The  sale  of  NPLs  will  alleviate \nthese problems and help stimulate economic growth. \n \n40. \nThe  benefits  of  resolving  an  NPL  crisis  are  well  proven,  judging  from  the  success  of \ncountries outside Asia. For example, in the US or Sweden, when NPLs decreased, the national \neconomies began  to  recover  and  grow;  companies  and  businesses  started  creating  new  jobs; \nand  investors\u2014more  confident  of  a  country\u2019s  long-term  growth  prospects\u2014began  to  pump \ninvestment  capital  into  the  country\u2019s  stock,  bond,  and  property  markets  as  well  as  individual \ncompanies and businesses. The development of banks\u2019 credit profiles reflects this improvement. \nFor  example,  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s  recently  raised  in  2005  the  outlooks  of  Bank  of  China  and \nChina Construction Bank from stable to positive. The outlook upgrades were a direct outcome of \nthe improvement of the Government of the PRC\u2019s support and the resulting improvement in the \nbanks\u2019  asset  quality  by  reducing  NPLs.  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s  noted  that  these  banks  \u201chave \nsolidly  embarked  on  the  path  of  financial  reform.  This  trend  was  accompanied  with  a  boost  in \nprovisioning and increase in balance sheet transparency.\u201d8  \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Impact: Maculus I and Maculus II \n\n \n41. \nThe  financial  community  has  taken  notice  of  the  success  of  Maculus  I  in  combining \ndevelopmental and environmental goals with financial restructuring to create profitable returns. \nParticipants  in  the  restructuring  sector\u2014investors,  banks,  companies,  and  their  advisers\u2014are \nnow much more receptive to methodologies sponsored by ADB. However, more work needs to \nbe done to sustain this momentum. It is reckoned that there are still $400 billion\u2013$1,000 billion \nof NPLs and impaired loans in the Asian financial system. Maculus I\u2019s $138 million has punched \nwell  above  its  weight  but  it  will  need  further  work  to  make  a  lasting  impact.  The  backing  of \nMaculus II by ADB will demonstrate ADB\u2019s and ADM\u2019s confidence that the methodologies used \n\n                                                \n \n7   ADB. 2000.

The  restructuring  of  distressed  assets,  which \nhave  an  adverse  financial  or  capital  structure,  has  several  development  benefits,  including  (i) \nmotivating  management  and  shareholders  to  operate  assets  transparently  and  efficiently  to \nbenefit creditors, shareholders, and the community; (ii) ensuring that \u201cgood\u201d assets, which would \nhave been liquidated by the creditors, continue to operate and generate a return; (iii) ensuring \nthat \u201cbad\u201d assets, which are non-operating and have no chance of generating a sufficient return, \nare  liquidated  so  that  capital  can  be  deployed  more  effectively;  and  (iv)  promoting  good \ncorporate governance so that management and shareholders operate assets transparently, as \nwell as an environmentally sound approach to operations \n \n43. \nADB\u2019s involvement in Maculus I meant that the aims and objectives of Maculus II were, \nand  are,  radically  different  from  other  funds  in  this  sector.  While  other  funds  have  focused  on \nshort-term  gains  from  downsizing  or  liquidation  of  assets,  ADM  has  focused  on  rehabilitation \nand  growth  within  the  context  of  satisfactory  environmental  standards. Motivating  the  investee \ncompanies to take the ADM route to better health, with additional costs such as environmental \naudits  and  working  within  a  more  transparent  and  ethical  framework  than  before,  was  only \npossible  because  of  (i)  the  written  policies  of  Maculus  II,  which  meant  there  could  be  no \nnegotiation  on  these  issues;  and  (ii)  the  borrowers\u2019  perception  that  Maculus  I  would  behave \nresponsibly and ethically as it monitored the investment. \n \nThe development impact is mainly indicated by how successful the restructuring of the \n44. \ndistressed company was. In other words, an unsuccessful restructuring will lead to insolvency, \nand a successful restructuring will restore the status quo or even lead to new growth with further \nspill-over  effect  to  the  economy  as  a  whole.  This  is  the  main,  direct  developmental  impact \nachieved  by  this  type  of  intervention.  In  other  words,  the  level  of  success  of  the  restructuring \nand \nlogically, \ndevelopment  impact  and  the  internal  rate  of  return  (IRR)  of  Maculus  II\u2019s  investments  are \npositively correlated, too; i.e., the IRR increases because the restructuring was successful and \nequity prices go up and debt gets repaid as the respective company again develops positively. \nThe  high  level  of  confidence  of  existing  and  new  investors  in  the  returns  of  Maculus  II \ndemonstrates their confidence in the developmental impact.9 \n \n45.  Maculus  I  was  57.5%  invested  in  the  first  year  (over  90%  invested  in  the  first  17 \nmonths),  ensuring  that  investors  were  not  paying  unnecessary  fees  on  committed,  but  un-\ninvested, funds. Maculus II has already produced healthy returns. Maculus I has demonstrated \nthat good returns are not necessarily compromised by an \u201cethically focused\u201d investment style. \n \n46. \nLessons  Learned.  Maculus  I  demonstrated  that  several  factors  are  necessary  to \nprevent  distressed  situations  and  enable  sensible  restructuring,  including  (i)  a  stable  and \nreliable  legal  system  and  regulatory  framework  with  particular  regard  to  security  (e.g.,  title \nregistration) and bankruptcy/foreclosure laws; (ii) management of companies within parameters \nand  restricted  business  environment  stipulated  by  lenders;  (iii)  strong  corporate  governance, \nwhich guarantees checks and balances to avoid management decisions that put companies at \nrisk  (e.g., unsustainable  expansion  plans,  backed  by  borrowings  not  correlated  to  actual  cash \n\nimpact  are  positively  correlated.  Therefore \n\nlevel  of  developmental \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n \n9   Appendix 1 provides a more detailed outline of the major development outcomes and measures for development \n\neffectiveness. \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n \n \n\nflow;  appropriate  due  diligence  by  sponsors  and  lenders  to  develop  sufficient  tariff/passenger \nassumptions);  (iv)  an  investor  that  can  bring  together  all  parties  involved\u2014shareholders, \nmanagement, lenders, and other company stakeholders\u2014and develop and negotiate a sensible \nrestructuring plan, potentially removing uncooperative parties and use of political influence; (v) a \nreview  of  major  strategic  initiatives  and  financing  plans  of  companies,  including  the  detailed \nreview  of  the  business  plan,  assumptions,  use  of  proceeds,  etc.,  to  insure  that  strategic \ninitiatives  are  aligned  with  the  interests  of  all  stakeholders/shareholders;  and  (vi)  solid \ninvestment and market analysis in which transparency of information is critical. \n  \n\n \n3. \n\nRole of ADB and Value Added \n\n \n47. \nSpecifically, ADB\u2019s continued involvement as an investor will help maintain these value-\nadded inputs: (i) continued support for Maculus II\u2019s environmental analysis in deal due diligence \nand ongoing portfolio company monitoring; and (ii) additional support for recently revised ADB \npolicies regarding anticorruption, anti-money-laundering, and anti-terrorism representations and \ncovenants. In addition, it will (i) stimulate and facilitate reforms in the targeted countries, push \ngovernments  to  revise  laws  and  regulations,  and  create  an  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory \nframework;  (ii)  support  government  initiatives  to  pursue  financial  sector  reforms  aimed  at \nresolving problems caused by mounting NPLs; and (iii) provide modern, replicable, and market-\ntested  mechanisms  for  NPL  and  distressed  asset  resolution,  creating  benchmarks,  bankable \nstructures, and enhancing trust in the legal and regulatory environment. \n \n48. \nInvesting  in  Maculus  II  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  promoting  (i)  poverty \nreduction through job preservation and creation; (ii) private sector development; and (iii) country \nstrategies  addressing  issues  such  as  introducing  best  practices  in  corporate  governance, \nbanking reform, NPL resolution, and infrastructure preservation and development. \n \n49. \nInvestment in Maculus II is a logical continuation of ADB\u2019s work with ADM based on the \nsuccessful results, in terms of projected financial returns and Maculus II\u2019s impact on corporate \ngovernance and development impact in Asia. \n \nK. \n \n50. \nProper and complete records and accounts of Maculus II's business will be maintained \nat the office of the custodian (HSBC Institutional Trust [Asia] Limited). The books and records \nwill  be  kept  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  US  accounting  principles.  Periodic  reports \ndetailing the financial status of Maculus II\u2019s performance will be provided to the limited partners. \n \n51. \nMaculus II annually.  \n \nL. \n \n52. \nThe  envisaged  exit  mechanisms  for  Maculus  II\u2019s  investments  will  vary  depending  on \nholding  periods,  market  conditions,  expected  future  growth,  tax,  and  other  considerations. \nTypically  for  debt,  the  exit  route  after  restructuring  in  the  current  climate  will  be  refinancing \nthrough local bank debt or a debenture issue. For equity holdings, exit routes may be to sell the \ninvestment  to  the  original  shareholders,  other  strategic  buyers,  competitors,  or  via  an  initial \npublic offering (IPO). Other exit routes include selling the debt instruments or their derivatives to \nanother investor, asset sales, and repayment from cash flows. \n\nAn  international  firm  of  chartered  accountants  will  audit  the  books  and  records  of \n\nRecords, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nExit of ADB\u2019s Investment  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n53. \nADB  will  enter  into  a  suitable  limited  partnership  agreement  with  the  general  partner, \nwhich  will  indicate  ADB\u2019s  commitment  of  up  to  $25  million  (representing  7.62%  of  paid  up \ncapital;  ADB  would  not  be  the  single  largest  investor)  in  the  equity  capital  (i.e.,  limited \npartnership  interest)  of  Maculus  II  following  approval  of  the  proposed  investment  by  ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors.
