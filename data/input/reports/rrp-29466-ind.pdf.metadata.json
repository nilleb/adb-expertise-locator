It  is  a  high  priority  investment\nfor  the  government  of  West  Bengal,  and  is  designed  to  support\nthe  government\u2019s  move  to  devolve  responsibility  for  urban\nmanagement  from  the  states  to  the  municipal  administrations.\nUnder  the  Project,  a  policy  and  institutional  framework  will  be\nestablished to sustain the investments in sewerage and drainage,\nimprovements,  and  canal\nsolid  waste  management,  slum \nrehabilitation.  A  stakeholder  consultative  process,  woven  into\nevery aspect of the Project, will ensure the design is responsive\nto the community and addresses basic human needs. Assistance\nwill be provided to implement the Project, together with capacity\nbuilding to support municipal services.\n\nCategory B\nAn \nsummary is a core appendix.\n\ninitial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken; \n\nthe\n\ninto \n\nthat  has \n\nlargely  untreated, \n\nCalcutta  was  prioritized  for  assistance  because  it  suffers  from\nsevere  environmental  problems,  and  has  a  municipal\nimplemented  progressive  urban\ncorporation \nIn  Calcutta,  urban\nin  recent  years. \ngovernance  reforms \ninfrastructure deficiencies are clearly evident. In the project area,\nonly  17  percent  of  the  population  are  connected  to  a  sewerage\nsystem,  and  less  than  50  percent  of  the  area  is  covered  by  a\ndrainage  system,  which  is  grossly  inadequate.  Industrial  wastes\nthe  surrounding  environment,\nflow, \nexposing the community to acids, toxic chemicals, paints, varnish,\nand  other  highly  toxic  compounds.  During  the  wet  season,\nflooding  occurs  frequently,  resulting  in  widespread  exposure  to\npathogens,  particularly  in  the  low-lying  slum  areas.  The  high\npopulation  density  of  the  slum  settlements  remains  a  major\npublic  health  concern  with  regard  to  the  transmission  of\ncommunicable  diseases,  especially  tuberculosis.  Around  50\npercent of the target population in the project area live in slum\nhousing  or  worse;  this  represents  around  700,000  people.  An\nestimated 26-30 percent of the slum dwelling households in the\ntarget area fall below the poverty line \u2014 some 180,000-210,000\npeople, or 13-15 percent of the population in the project area.\n\nThe  Project  comprises  the  highest  priority  investments  under\nthe  Municipal  Calcutta  Environment  Improvement  Program,  a\nlong-term master plan prepared under Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) technical assistance. The objectives of the Project are to\n(i)  improve  the  environment  in  the  outer  areas  of  Calcutta,  (ii)\nreduce  poverty  in  the  low-income  areas  through  affordable\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fiii\n\naccess  to  basic  urban  services,  (iii)  facilitate  community\nempowerment  through  participatory  processes,  (iv)  protect  the\nenvironment from adverse developmental impacts, and (v) help\ndevelop  Calcutta  Municipal  Corporation  (CMC)  as  a  proficient\nand autonomous municipality. The Project has six components:\nA.  a  stakeholder  consultation  process,  designed  to  promote\nthrough\nstakeholder  participation,  support  policy \nimproved  awareness,  and  educate  communities  about\nenvironmental  health  linkages;  B.  sewerage  and  drainage\nimprovements;  C.  solid  waste  management;  D.  slum\nimprovements;  E.  canal  improvements;  and  F.  implementation\nassistance and capacity building.\n\nreform \n\nThe Project cost is estimated at $360 million equivalent, of which\n$103.7  million  is  foreign  currency  cost  and  $256.3  million\nequivalent  is  local  currency  cost.

Subsequently, a loan preappraisal mission2 visited\nIndia  on  23  May-8  June  2000  and  reached  an  agreement  on  the  proposed  project  scope,\nestimated  cost,  financing  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  other  related  details.  The\npreappraisal mission was upgraded to appraisal status on 9 October 2000, following submission\nby CMC of a resettlement plan acceptable to ADB. This report is based on the findings of these\nADB  missions,  consultation  with  project  beneficiaries,  reports  prepared  by  the  TA  consultants,\ndiscussions with the central and state governments and the executing agencies, and discussions\nwith other international assistance agencies. Appendix 1 sets out the project design in a logical\nframework.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nUrban Sector\n\n1.\n\nIndia\n\nThe face of urban India has changed dramatically during recent decades. India\u2019s central\n3.\nand state governments have made considerable progress in bringing about economic reforms\nand  greater  liberalization,  which  has  resulted  in  the  emergence  of  cities  as  the  engines  of\neconomic growth. India\u2019s cities now contribute over 50 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), and their economies are growing so rapidly that they are expected to contribute\nover  60  percent  to  India\u2019s  GDP  by  the  year  2001.  More  than  90  percent  of  all  government\nrevenues  come  from  its  cities.  There  has  been  a  price  to  pay  for  this  growth,  however.  The\ndemand for labor has attracted many rural migrants, whose increasing numbers have swelled\nthe population particularly in the slums and poorer sections of society. The urban population in\n1997  was  over  260  million,  and  is  projected  to  grow  to  nearly  300  million  by  2001  and  550\nmillion by 2020. Urban population growth is largely concentrated in cities having populations of\n100,000 or more (Class I), and   especially   in   the   megacities    (populations in excess of 10\nmillion).      India      currently      has        two    megacities    (Calcutta  and  Mumbai)      and            is\nexpected     to   have six by 2025. In the Class I cities, and particularly the megacities, up to 30\n\n                                                \n1  TA 3089-IND: Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project, for $1,000,000, approved on 16 October 1998.\n2  The  mission  comprised  G.  Jackson,  Sr.  Project  Engineer  and  Mission  Leader;  K.  Gerhaeusser,  Sr.  Programs\nOfficer;  A.  Goswami,  Counsel;  R.  Jayewardene,  Social  Development  Specialist;  S.  Popov,  Environmental\nSpecialist and I. Walker, Financial Analyst (staff consultant).\n\n\f2\n\npercent of the total population is \u201cfloating\u201d, i.e., people who come into the city on a daily basis\nto seek employment.\n\nresulting \n\n4.\nInvestment  and  development  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  rising  demand  of  the  urban\nin  severe  price  distortions,  environmental  degradation,  poor\npopulations, \nenvironmental  health,  and  increasing  poverty  levels.  The  growing  population  pressures  are\nplacing  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services  under  a  great  strain.  The  1991  census\nrecorded that only one half of urban households have access to safe drinking water, sanitation,\nor electricity, with an estimated 5 percent of households deprived of all of these basic services.\nFurther,  less  than  50  percent  of  wastewater  is  actually  collected,  and  much  less  is  treated.\nEnvironmental health conditions are consequently poor for many sections of society, but none\nmore so than the slums and poorer groups, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating. National\npoverty levels are over 30 percent.\n\n5.\nHistorically, funding of urban development and services has been provided primarily by\nthe central and state governments, and to a lesser extent by municipalities. However, because\nthe  municipalities  are  unable  to  mobilize  much  in  financial  resources,  the  central  and  state\ngovernments find it necessary to finance almost all capital investment and subsidize recurrent\ncosts  in  the  urban  sector.  Due  to  funding  constraints,  such  assistance  is  also  very  limited.\nMaintaining  and  increasing  the  productivity  of  India\u2019s  cities  however  will  require  substantial\ninvestments in the urban sector. Although this is well recognized by the Government, it is not\nable  to  provide  adequate  financial  support  to  all  urban  centers,  and  is  encouraging  state\ngovernments  and municipalities  to assume greater responsibility for their own socioeconomic\ndevelopment.  In  this  respect,  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  (74th  CAA),  1992,\nprovides  a  legal  framework  for  decentralized  governance  down  to  the  municipal  level.  In\nsupport  of  this  legislation,  the  Government  has  been  progressively  working  toward  more\nequitable  tax  sharing  arrangements  between  the  central,  state,  and  municipal  government\nlevels,  and  has  been  encouraging  enhanced  mobilization  of  local  financial  resources.  In\nconcert  with  their  state  governments,  several  municipalities  have  made  some  progress  with\nimplementing  the  intent  of  the  74th  CAA,  including  the  megacity  of  Calcutta,  and  the  cities  of\nAhmedabad and Bangalore. However, further and substantial progress needs to be achieved\nin this area to meet future urban needs.\n\n6.\nThe ability of the governments to meet the funding requirements of the sector is under\nthreat,  as  the  combined  fiscal  position  of  the  central  and  state  governments  has  worsened\nsignificantly  since  the  mid-1990s.  The  state  governments\u2019  fiscal  positions  are  of  particular\ninterest, as they are principally responsible, together with the municipalities, for providing social\nservices  and  infrastructure  development.  It  is  vital  for  the  welfare  of  urban  communities\neverywhere, and especially the poor, that the state governments and their municipalities fully\nimplement  the  intent  and  provisions  of  the  74th  CAA.  This  will  require  settling  issues  such  as\ndebt  financing,  municipal  financial  management,  urban  planning,  and  mobilization  of  local\nfinancial  resources.  Currently,  these  issues  are  significant  constraints  to  financing  of  urban\nservices.\n\n2.\n\nCalcutta\n\nThe  Calcutta  metropolitan  area  (CMA)  is  the  capital  of  the  State  of  West  Bengal,  and\n7.\nthree  municipal  corporations,  34\nthe  most  populous  city \nmunicipalities, and several village-level committee areas; covers 1,380 square kilometers (km2);\nand  has  about  12  million  people.  The  nucleus  of  the  city  is  the  Calcutta  municipality,  which\ncovers 187 km2 and\n\nIndia.  CMA  comprises \n\nin \n\n\f3\n\nhouses an estimated 4.5 million people, which is about 40 percent of CMA\u2019s population. Municipal\nadministration in Calcutta dates from 1727. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act, which\nwas  introduced  in  1980,  is  a  progressive  legislation  that  contains  much  of  the  reform  currently\nunder consideration in the urban sector in India, and was enacted well before the 74th CAA. The\nCMC Act established the municipal concept of a corporation governed by the elected Mayor-in-\nCouncil (MIC), which elects the mayor.3 The executive power of the corporation is exercised by\nthe MIC, comprising the mayor, deputy mayor, and 10 other elected members of the corporation,\neach having responsibility for a specific function. The mayor is CMC\u2019s chief executive officer, and\nthe  state-appointed  municipal  commissioner  is  the  principal  executive  officer.4  The  municipal\ncommissioner reports to the mayor and supervises and controls all CMC officers and employees.\n\n8.\nThe  MIC  is  represented  at  the  local  level  by  elected  borough  committees  and  ward\ncouncils, which have responsibility for limited and specific functions of the CMC. The CMC is\nmade up of 15 boroughs, containing about 141 wards. Each ward is represented by an elected\ncouncilor, who sits on the borough committee. The functions of the municipality are discharged\nthrough its executive officers and staff who number over 42,000 and are stationed in the head\noffice and the borough and ward offices.\n\n9.\nIn 1970, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) was established by\nthe state government to facilitate the development of Calcutta\u2019s urban areas, with a mandate\nfor  urban  planning  and  implementation.  CMDA  has  been  the  vehicle  for  much  of  the  larger\ncapital  investments  made  in  the  CMA,  including  the  Ganga  Action  Plan  (GAP),  which  was\ndeveloped in the late 1960s to address the severe flooding and sanitation problems. Since that\ntime,  CMDA  has  been  gradually  constructing  the  sewerage  and  drainage  works  under  the\nGAP,  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank.    Following  commissioning  of  these  works,\nownership  was  to  be  transferred  to  the  municipalities.  However,  human  resource  constraints\nwithin  the  municipalities  and  limited  cost  recovery  levels  prevented  the  level  of  transfer\nanticipated.  Consequently,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  commissioned  water\nsupply and sewerage assets is currently shared by CMDA and the municipalities. In addition to\nthe  GAP  schemes,  CMC  has  been  making  small  but  significant  investments  in  water  supply\nand sewerage, funded from its own resources and to a more limited extent in conjunction with\nthe  private  sector  on  some  small  build-own-transfer  projects.  However,  such  private  sector\ninitiatives  remain  small  because  the  sector  is  not  yet  sufficiently  developed  to  attract\ncommercial proposals and no regulatory framework exists.\n\nCMC\u2019s obligatory functions under the CMC Act, 1980, include water supply, sewerage\n10.\nand  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  streets,  building  regulations,  community  health  and\nenvironmental sanitation, some town planning, and land-use control. The Act permits additional\ndiscretionary  functions:  CMC  has  found  it  necessary  to  become  involved  in  education  and\nhealth.  CMC\u2019s  sources  of  funding  for  these  services  include  the  consolidated  rate  charge\n(similar  to  property  tax),  permits  and  licenses,  and  state  government  transfers.  The  transfers\nrepresent about 50 percent of the total revenue.\n\nCMC uses both surface and groundwater sources for water supply, and has traditionally\n11.\nassigned a very high importance to this subsector. Consequently, over 85 percent of the CMC\npopulation  now  have  access  to  a  piped  water  supply.  Sewerage  has  not  enjoyed  the  same\nlevel of investment, which is reflected in the fact that      only  50 percent of the CMC population\nhave   a sewer    connection .   However, in   the  outer areas   of   CMC,  this   figure  drops  to\n\n                                                \n3  An MIC is an elected municipal cabinet.\n4  The municipal commissioner may be proposed by the MIC.\n\n\f4\n\nabout 17 percent. The older systems in the inner core area, many of which are over 100 years\nold, are generally combined systems, conveying stormwater as well as sewage and/or effluent.\nSeparate  sewerage  systems  are  becoming  increasingly  common,  particularly  in  the  newer\nouter  areas.  The  sewage,  effluent,  and  stormwater  from  the  inner  core  area  of  Calcutta  is\nconveyed by canal to the eastern wetland areas, where it is assimilated into the environment of\nthe  low-lying  swamp  areas.  The  sewage,  effluent,  and  stormwater  from  the  outer  areas  is\nconveyed  by  canal  to  receiving  waters  such  as  the  Ganges  River.  Calcutta\u2019s  flat  topography\nnecessitates  pumping  of  virtually  all  of  the  sewage,  effluent,  and  stormwater  to  the  points  of\ndischarge.  The  flat  topography  leads  to  severe  and  rapid  silting  of  many  of  the  canals  and\ndrains, which aggravates flooding. Solid waste collection is quite high in the inner core areas,\ncovering about 70-90 percent of the urban population, whereas collection efficiency in the outer\nareas  is  much  lower.  Solid  waste  is  disposed  of  at  three  sites  in  the  Calcutta  area.  Although\nthere  is  some  limited  collection  and  separate  disposal  of  hazardous  and  biomedical  wastes,\nmuch  enters  the  waste  stream  and  becomes  part  of  the  municipal  waste  at  the  landfill  sites.\nCMC  has  a  Bustee  Services  Cell,  which  provides  support  to  bustees  (slum  or  low-income\ncommunities). Registered bustees represent around 30 percent of the population in the fringe\nof  Calcutta,  with  refugee  colonies,  unregistered  bustees,  and  illegal  squatters  representing\naround 9 percent.\n\n12.\nThe  rapid  urbanization  of  Calcutta  has  placed  a  considerable  burden  on  the  urban\nenvironment. Calcutta is thought to currently have a population four times the size that it can\ncomfortably  accommodate:  CMC\u2019s  average  density  is  over  24,000  people/km2,  one  of  the\nhighest densities in India. Where sanitation facilities, and sewerage and drainage systems are\nas  yet  undeveloped,  the  overcrowding  in  the  traditional  working-class  settlements  creates\nserious pollution problems. A lack of housing has forced many of the poor to illegally occupy\npublic lands, such as the banks of drainage canals, which constricts flows and leads to further\nenvironmental pollution. Around half of the CMC population live in slum settlements, which are\ntypically  in  low-lying  areas  where  solid  and  liquid  wastes  accumulate.  Unsanitary  conditions\ncan develop quickly, as inadequate drainage and flood events disperse the wastes in the areas\nof  the  slum  communities.  This  results  in  the  contamination  of  wells  used  by  many  poor  and\nvulnerable groups.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n13. Within the constitutional framework of India, urban development and housing are state\nresponsibilities,  and  the  central  Government  plays  only  a  catalytic  and  supportive  role.  The\ncentral  Government\u2019s  major  role  in  the  urban  sector  is  to  formulate  broad  policies  at  the\nnational  level,  frame  legislation,  and  provide  financial  support  through  centrally  sponsored\nschemes and financial institutions. The mobilization of external assistance and the creation of\nan appropriate fiscal climate are also important roles.\n\n14.\nAlthough  India  does  not  yet  have  a  national  urban  policy,  a  draft  has  been  prepared,\nand was released following passage of the 74th CAA. The draft is being reviewed by the central\nGovernment\u2019s  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Poverty  Alleviation.  There  is  now  a  broad\nconsensus that a national policy is required to define and implement the provisions of the 74th\nCAA,  to  identify  policy  reform  initiatives,  and  to  outline  the  country's  strategies.  The  central\nGovernment prepares five-year development plans, but the emphasis is essentially on housing\nrather  than  urban  development.  Both  the  eighth  (1992-1997)  and  the  ninth  (1997-2002)  five-\nyear  plans  are  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  National  Housing  Policy,  adopted  in  1994.  The\nninth plan now promotes the role of state and local governments as managers of\n\n\f5\n\nthe  whole  housing  and  urban  development  process,  and  expects  them  to  establish  efficient\nlinkages  between  the  components  of  the  process  to  optimize  the  efforts  of  the  stakeholders.\nThe  ninth  plan  also  promotes  legal,  institutional,  and  fiscal  reform  initiatives  aimed  at\nenhancing market-based approaches to housing and urban development.\n\n15.\nNational  initiatives  reflect  the  central  Government\u2019s  priorities  in  the  urban  sector\u2014the\nprovision  of  urban  infrastructure  and  the  reduction  of  poverty.  Two  such  initiatives  are  the\nMegacity  Scheme  and  Integrated  Development  of  Small  and  Medium  Towns  Scheme.  In\naddition,  there  have  been  important  central  programs  for  poverty  reduction,  such  as  the\nSwarana Jayanti Shahri Rozgar Yojana (golden jubilee urban employment program), and the\nurban self-employment scheme. These schemes emphasize the provision of basic services to\nurban  poor,  enhancing  their  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities  through\nprograms  like  microcredit  and  their  close  participation  in  urban  project  implementation.  In\naddition, in April 1999, the Government prepared a draft national slum improvements policy.\n\nThe  most  important  legislation  affecting  the  urban  sector  in  recent  years  is  the  74th\n16.\nCAA, which provides the framework for the devolution of power from the state to the municipal\nlevel  and  below.  Since  enactment  of  the  74th  CAA,  municipal  elections  are  held  in  all  states,\nstate  election  commissions  have  been  established,  borough  committees  and  ward  councils\nhave  been  elected,  many  district  and  metropolitan  planning  committees  have  been  elected,\nand  state  finance  commissions  have  been  established  to  recommend  measures  to  achieve\ndevolution.  At  the  state  level,  the  government  of  West  Bengal  established  the  State  Finance\nCommission in 1995, which recommended a more equitable tax sharing arrangement between\nthe  state  and  the  municipalities.  Municipal  elections  were  initiated  following  enactment  of  the\n74th  CAA;  and  CMC  held  elections  for  the  second  time  in  June  2000.  Furthermore,  the\nestablishment  of  a  Calcutta  Metropolitan  Planning  Committee  is  now  underway  following  the\nmunicipal  elections.  At  the  municipal  level,  the  CMC  Act,  1980,  is  progressive  legislation.\nPreceding the 74th CAA by almost 12 years, it contains many of the provisions on cost recovery\nand devolved functions called for by the national legislation.\n\n17.\nIn  the  1990s,  faced  with  severe  environmental  degradation  and  a  growing  urban\npoverty  problem,  the  government  of  West  Bengal  prepared  two  long-term  and  important\ndocuments\u2014  the Basic Development Plan  and  the Master Plan for Water Supply, Sewerage\nand Drainage, Calcutta Metropolitan District (1996-2001).  These  plans,  which  address  the\ninstitutional  and  planning  aspects  of  development  as  well  as  the  physical  investment\nrequirements,  have  been  progressively  implemented  since  that  time.  Calcutta  has  also\nbenefited from the Government\u2019s Megacity Scheme, which promotes the building of revolving\nfunds  for  sustained  investment  in  urban  infrastructure  through  the  adoption  of  direct  and\nindirect  cost  recovery  measures  including  bond  issues.5  Under  the  Basic  Development  Plan,\nthe  Bustee  Improvement  Program  (BIP)  began  implementation  in  1970,  and  is  sometimes\nknown  as  the  \u201csanitation  model  of  slum  improvement.\u201d  The  program  was  very  successful.  In\n1990, it had covered about 2 million of the 3 million bustee population in the metropolitan area,\nand  about  300,000  of  the  1  million  people  living  in  refugee  colonies.  Since  that  time,  further\nschemes have been initiated such as the Basic Minimum Services Scheme, and the Refugee\nColony  Improvement  Scheme.  The  Project  design  is  founded  on  these  plans  and  schemes,\nand has been developed to take account of contemporary urban demands.\n\n                                                \n5  The  megacity  scheme  was  introduced  following  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Commission  on\nUrbanization (Government of India, 1998), and covers the cities of Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, and\nBangalore.\n\n\f6\n\nCalcutta\u2019s  development  has  been  the  subject  of  several  national  and  state  plans.\n18.\nCalcutta\u2014City  of  Joy  (CMC,  1986)  was  the  first  comprehensive  development  program  that\nCMC had produced. Although only a small part of the plan has been implemented, it remains\nsignificant  for  its  breadth  of  vision.  In  1990,  the  Perspective  Plan  for  Calcutta  2011  (State\nPlanning  Board,  1990)  and  the  Plan  for  Metropolitan  Development  1990-2015  (CMDA,  1990)\nwere released; these documents took the view that Calcutta\u2019s development should be viewed\nas an integral part of the state\u2019s urban development. Then, in 1995, the Calcutta Environmental\nManagement Strategy and Action Plan was drawn up to improve the environment in CMA for\nits 12 million citizens. Finally, in 1996, the government of West Bengal approved the Land Use\nand Development Control Plan for CMC Area, a useful tool for the future development of the\ncity. The physical layout of the Project has been developed within the general directions of the\nspatial framework laid down for Calcutta by these plans.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n19.\nADB\u2019s operations in the urban sector commenced in 1993, and include six loans with a\ntotal value of $1.33 billion\u2014Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project, the Housing\nFinance  Project,  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project,  Karnataka  Urban\nDevelopment  and  Coastal  Environmental  Management  Project,  Urban  and  Environment\nInfrastructure Facility and Housing Finance II Project.6 In addition, ADB has provided 15 TAs\namounting  to  $7.15  million  over  seven  years  for  the  preparation  of  projects  and  capacity\nbuilding. ADB\u2019s assistance has concentrated on generating ownership of investments, poverty\nreduction,  cost  recovery,  transparency,  and  good  governance.  Appendix  2  sets  out  external\nassistance in detail.\n\n20.\nExternal  assistance  to  the  sector  from  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,\nincluding Germany, Japan, Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank,\nhas  been  increasing  over  the  past  few  years.  Funding  equivalent  to  $1.9  billion  has  been\nprovided  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  primarily  from  the  Japan  Bank  for  International\nCooperation and the World Bank. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and\nTamil  Nadu,  have  been  the  principal  beneficiaries  of  this  assistance.  In  addition,  Rajasthan\nState  has  received  concessional  loans  from  Germany  for  improving  water  supply  and\nsanitation  in  selected  cities.  The  assistance  has  focused  on  improved  water  supply,\nenvironmental  sanitation,  housing,  public  health,  slum  rehabilitation,  access  to  financial\nservices,  employment  and  income  generating  opportunities,  institutional  development  and\ncapacity building, and enhancement of cost recovery levels. As with ADB, the major thrust of\nall the key agencies is poverty reduction.\n\n21.\nOne  of  the  most  significant  external  assistance  programs  to  Calcutta  commenced  in\n1962, when the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned the preparation of a master\nplan for water supply, sewerage, and drainage for the greater Calcutta area. In 1972, the World\nBank  provided  loan  assistance  for  CMDA  to  implement  the  Calcutta  Urban  Development\nProject, which included water supply, sewerage, and drainage. The World Bank provided two\nfollow-on  projects  (1978-1979  and  1984-1992)  which  included  programs  for  low-income\ncommunities  to  improve  their  health,  education,  employment  generation,  and  capacities.  In\n1991, DFID provided grant assistance to CMDA for the Calcutta Slum Improvement Project\n\n                                                \n6 Loans 1415/1416-IND, for $105 million, approved on 14 December 1995; 1549/1550/1551-IND, for $300 million,\napproved on 25 September 1997; 1647-IND, for $250 million, approved on 3 December 1998; 1704-IND, for $175\nmillion,  approved  on  26  October  1999;  1719/1720/1721-IND,  for  $200  million,  approved  on  17  December  1999,\nand 1758/1759/1760/1761-IND, for $300 million approved on 21 September 2000.\n\n\f7\n\n(CSIP), which sought to build on the experiences of previous slum improvements, but placed\ngreater emphasis on community participation. In 1995, DFID provided further grant assistance\nto the government of West Bengal for the Calcutta Environmental Management Strategy and\nAction Plan (CEMSAP), which sought to develop an integrated approach to address Calcutta\u2019s\nenvironmental  problems.  The  Project  design  is  consistent  with  the  principles  and  strategies\ndeveloped  under  CEMSAP.  More  recently,  DFID  has  arranged  grant  assistance  for  the\nCalcutta Urban Services Project (CUSP), which assists several municipalities adjacent to CMC\nfor capacity building in municipal and environmental management. The Project will have strong\nlinkages  with  the  CUSP,  as  they  share  many  common  issues  and  are  geographically  very\nclose.\n\n22.\nOne  of  the  key  lessons  related  to  external  support  shared  by  all  external  funding\nagencies is that investment alone is not adequate to achieve the desired goals. Investment has\nto be supported by a number of other inputs including a strong policy reform agenda, capacity\nbuilding,  improved  governance,  institutional  restructuring,  and  establishment  of  partnerships\nbetween public and private agencies.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n23.\nThe  proposed  Project  is  the  seventh  loan  to  the  Government  in  the  sector.  Three\nprojects are being implemented, two in Karnataka and the other in Rajasthan.7 Although some\nlessons can be drawn from all ADB\u2019s projects, those from the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project (KUIDP) are most relevant to the Project. The lessons learned from the\nother projects are very similar to those of the KUIDP. Appendix 3 provides a detailed summary\nof  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  sector.  Key  areas  for  consideration  include  advance  action,\ncommunity  awareness  and  participation, \nimplementation  arrangements,  contracting\narrangements, land acquisition, and legislative reform.\n\nThe  KUIDP\u2019s  executing  agency  (EA)  took  nine  months  to  mobilize  the  consultants.\n24.\nAlthough the EA estimates that the KUIDP will be completed within the six-year implementation\nschedule, advance action on the recruitment of consultants would have helped significantly in\nachieving an early completion. ADB\u2019s experience with this project, with respect to community\nawareness, empowerment, and ownership, also shows that substantial time (12-18 months) is\nneeded  to  establish  the  stakeholder  groups.  Developing  the  trust  necessary  to  carry  out\nphysical  works  and  engendering  community  involvement  takes  a  concerted  effort  by  the  EA,\nthe  local  government,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  NGOs  need  to  be\nincluded early in the project preparation process.\n\n25.\nThe  roles  of  the  various  implementing  agencies  were  not  well  defined  initially,  neither\nwere  they  adequately  staffed  in  terms  of  capability  and  numbers.  As  a  result,  progress  was\nslow  initially.  Following  a  more  detailed  definition  of  roles  and  more  attention  to  staffing,\nimplementation  is  proceeding  satisfactorily.  Progress  on  the  KUIDP  is  also  being  affected  by\ndifficulties  due  to  poor  planning  and  late  release  of  counterpart  funding.  Counterpart  funding\nrequirements,  together  with  a  solid  commitment,  must  be  clearly  agreed  and  set  out  during\nprocessing, and during each year of implementation. Tender documents for the KUIDP differed\nin a number of respects to those normally used in the sector in India, such as the cost of third\n\n                                                \n7  Loan  No.1415-IND:  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project,  for  $85  million,  approved  on  14\nDecember  1995,  Loan  No.1647-IND:  Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project,  for  $250  million,\napproved  on  3  December  1998  and  Loan  No.  1704-IND:  Karnataka  Urban  Development  and  Coastal\nEnvironmental Management Project, for $175 million, approved on 26 October 1999.\n\n\f8\n\nparty  inspection,  risk  associated  with  fixed  price  contracts,  the  cost  of  performance  bonds,\nquality  control  and  interest  costs.  The  domestic  contractors  must  be  provided  with  very  clear\ninstructions on ADB requirements. Prequalification of contractors must be undertaken carefully,\nand  should  be  accompanied  by  some  measures,  such  as  workshops,  to  educate  the\ncontracting industry.\n\n26.\nLand  acquisition  is  the  major  source  of  delay  in  the  KUIDP,  taking  over  two  years  to\ncomplete. The KUIDP experience demonstrates the need to establish a solid legal framework\nfor land acquisition during loan processing to avoid unnecessary delays. Consideration should\nalso be given to phased conditionalities to ensure intermediate land acquisition proceeds in a\ntimely manner. Under the KUIDP, a change in property tax valuation was sought, from a rental\nbasis to an area and capital value basis. Difficulties in implementing the reforms primarily result\nbecause  the  legal  framework  was  not  clearly  established  before  attempting  to  introduce  the\nnecessary reforms. Such legal amendments must be agreed and passed well in advance of the\nlogistics required to effect such change.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n\n27.\nIn India, ADB\u2019s overall strategic objectives are to foster sustained economic growth to\ncreate  employment  and  reduce  poverty.  In  the  urban  sector,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\noverarching  objective  of  poverty  reduction,  the  strategy  stresses  the  importance  of  focused\nprograms targeting the poorer groups, which form the basis for or are integrated into the overall\ndesign  of  projects.  ADB  will  also  promote  policy  reform  measures  to  address  the  legal,\ninstitutional, and financial constraints in the urban sector. These reform measures will be aimed\nat  liberalizing  India\u2019s  land  and  housing  markets  to  attract  more  private  sector  investment  into\nthe sector.\n\n28.\nADB\u2019s  Urban  Sector  Strategy  for  India  is  to  assist  with  urban  (i)  infrastructure  and\nservices,  (ii)  transportation,  and  (iii)  housing.  For  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  ADB  will\ncontinue to support integrated urban development projects to improve urban environments and\nliving  conditions,  especially  for  the  poorer  groups,  and  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local\ngovernments  in  the  implementation  of  projects  and  delivery  of  services.  Such  support  will  be\nused  as  the  basis  for  implementing  the  decentralization  provisions  of  the  74th  CAA,  and\nintroducing  and  demonstrating \nfuture,  ADB  will\ncomplement  these  efforts  with  assistance  in  the  establishment  of  urban  and  environmental\ninfrastructure  funds,  which  will  attract  public  and  private  sector  capital  to  finance  urban\ndevelopment.\n\nfinancial  sustainability  measures. \n\nIn \n\n29. With regard to urban transportation, transport systems management will be a focus of\nADB assistance, either in conjunction with integrated urban development projects or as single\nprojects, to promote low-cost alternative measures that reduce congestion and increase road\ncapacity by regulating the movement of intracity traffic. ADB will help prepare transport system\nmanagement plans, complemented by capacity building in their implementation, enforcement,\nand monitoring.\n\n30.\nADB will provide assistance to the housing subsector in the three areas: (i) lending to\nfinancial  intermediaries  as  a  means  to  link  the  formal  and  informal  housing  finance  sectors,\nthereby  increasing  the  availability  and  affordability  of  housing  finance  to  low-income\nhouseholds; (ii) support to low-income housing subprojects with a particular emphasis on using\n\n\f9\n\nmicrocredit  schemes  for  housing  and  income  generation  loans;  and  (iii)  provision  of  TA  for\nsecondary mortgage development.\n\n31.\nAll  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  programs  will  incorporate  capacity  building  initiatives  aimed  at\npromoting sustainable urban management. In general, ADB\u2019s approach to capacity building will\nbe  to  support  the  intent  and  provisions  of  the  74th  CAA.  Urban  management  therefore\nconstitutes the principal focus of ADB\u2019s urban sector capacity building program.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n32.\nSince 1993, ADB and the Government have maintained dialogue on urban policy and\nrelated  institutional  and  financial  reforms.  ADB-assisted  urban  development  projects  in\nKarnataka and Rajasthan were milestones for urban development, built on key policy reforms,\nwhich  fully  supported  the  central  and  state  governments\u2019  efforts  to  decentralize  urban\nmanagement  responsibilities  to  local  governments.  During  project  processing,  ADB  has\npursued  an  active  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  on  institutional,  financial,  and\noperational aspects of the sector. The content of the dialogue builds on recent CMC initiatives,\ntogether with the policy reform agreed on previous ADB projects, which has been developed to\naddress  contemporary  issues.  Appendix  4  provides  a  matrix  of  the  policy  and  institutional\nreform agenda.\n\n33.\nThe policy dialogue has benefited from the stakeholder workshops conducted since TA\ninception, and from CMC\u2019s general participatory approach for the Project. Accordingly, there is\na broad agreement with CMC on a number of policy issues. In view of the progressive nature\nof  the  CMC  Act,  1980,  reforms  focus  on  a  few  key  issues,  relating  to  the  creation  of\nframeworks  for  the  sustainable  management  of  municipal  services,  enhanced  levels  of\nresource  mobilization,  CMC\u2019s  future  role  and  function,  and  CMC\u2019s  improved  capability  and\nefficiency. ADB and CMC are also engaged in dialogue on the benefits of pursuing stakeholder\nparticipation.\n\nSustainable  Delivery  of  Urban  Services.  The  CMC  Act,  1980,  and \n\n34.\nthe\nrecommendations of the State Finance Commission, 1995, provide the principal framework for\nmanaging  CMC.  The  State  Finance  Corporation  recommended  a  more  equitable  sharing  of\ntaxes  between  government  of  West  Bengal  and  CMC.  Specifically,  it  recommended  that  16\npercent of the tax revenue collected by the state should be transferred to local bodies, of which\nCMC\u2019s share would be 3.9 percent. Further key recommendations were that the state should\nsupport 100 percent of the cost-of-living allowance that CMC is obliged to pay to its staff, and\nthat  CMC\u2019s  share  of  the  entertainment  tax  should  be  increased  from  50  to  100  percent.  The\ngovernment has accepted these recommendations, and appropriate transfers will be made in\nFY2002. The budgetary allocations that the state has historically been required to provide for\nwater supply and bustee services (on a matching grant basis), are not likely to be continued.\nHowever, since these allocations have not been made for several years, CMC should be in a\nposition of net fiscal gain with the new arrangements. The new measures will have a significant\nand beneficial impact on CMC\u2019s financial position.\n\n35.\nDirect  user  charges  have  not  been  traditionally  applied  by  CMC  for  water  supply,\nsewerage, drainage, or solid waste management (SWM). Funding for capital investments has\nbeen met either by CMC from its consolidated account, or by the government of West Bengal\nthrough  budgetary  allocation.  Provision  for  recurrent  costs  is  nominally  from  the  consolidated\nrate charge, which CMC is permitted to collect under the CMC Act. The charge, which is\n\n\f10\n\ncommonly  referred  to  as  a  property  tax,  covers  many  services,  including  water  supply,\nsewerage, and SWM. According to the CMC Act, 45 percent of the charge is to be allocated to\ncover the recurrent costs for water supply, sewerage, and SWM\u201415 percent for each service.\nIn recent years, CMC has only been able to allocate 9-15 percent for water supply, and 7-10\npercent for sewerage and drainage. However, SWM has enjoyed allocations of 17-22 percent.\nLess than 50 percent of the consolidated rate charge is collected, which is undermining CMC\u2019s\nefforts to generate more revenue. CMC has agreed to a time-bound action plan to improve the\ncollections  to  80  percent  by  FY2005.  Since  the  consolidated  rate  charge  must  cover  many\nother  municipal  services,  CMC  has  agreed  to  change  the  name  of  the  tax  from  consolidated\nrate charge to property tax.\n\n36.\nCurrently,  the  consolidated  rate  charge  is  assessed  at  fair  rental  rates  for  the  annual\nratable value (ARV). With this method, it is almost impossible to achieve full market rental for a\nproperty, thereby constraining revenue. The absence of an organized real estate market leads\nto the underreporting of rents and capital value in transactions. Further, the wide discretionary\npowers of assessment staff can lead to gross underassessments of ARV. In the case of CMC\nspecifically, the tax rate is capped at 40 percent, and any property having an ARV of Rs300 or\nless is exempt from tax. CMC has agreed to reform the method of assessing the consolidated\nrate charge so it is rated on an area basis, with some consideration for capital value; this will\nenhance revenues considerably. An amendment to the CMC Act will be required, together with\nissuance of rules under the CMC Act. Properties will also have to be revalued. The CMC has\nagreed  to  undertake  these  tasks  under  the  Project.  A  committee  has  been  established  to\nevaluate similar models in India.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  allocation  from  the  consolidated  rate  charge,  the  CMC  Act  also\n37.\nenables the corporation to generate revenue for water supply services through the application\nof direct user charges. However, until very recently there was no metering in the city, and only\nthe relatively small percentage of consumers with a ferrule (water connection) size greater than\n20  millimeters  (mm)  diameter  were  required  to  pay  on  a  flat  rate  basis.  Now,  CMC  has\ncommenced  a  metering  program  under  which  a  few  industrial,  commercial,  and  institutional\n(ICI) consumers have been metered and are beginning to pay by volume consumed. CMC has\nagreed  to  increase  the  cost  recovery  levels  of  water  supply.  This  will  commence  with  the\nprogressive application of a flat rate to consumers not having a meter, in parallel with CMC\u2019s\nprogram  to  gradually  expand  metering  to  all  consumers.  Subject  to  the  findings  of  a  current\nWorld Bank study on water supply in Calcutta, consumer metering will expand, and consumers\nwill be required to pay for the water supply service on the basis of a structured tariff. CMC has\nalso agreed that the 15 percent allocation toward the cost of supply from the consolidated rate\ncharge will remain for the medium term.\n\nAlthough the CMC Act permits user charges to be applied to ICI establishments for the\n38.\nprovision  of  sewerage  services,  it  does  not  permit  them  for  residences.  CMC  has  tentatively\nagreed at this stage that the CMC Act, 1980, should be amended to permit the implementation\nof user charges for sewerage and drainage as a surcharge on the water supply bill. It has also\nbeen agreed to retain the 15 percent allocation from the consolidated rate charge for sewerage\nand drainage, and rename it as an environmental charge.\n\n39.\nAs  with  sewerage,  the  CMC  Act  permits  user  charges  to  be  applied  to  ICI\nestablishments for SWM, but also excludes residences. CMC has agreed that the ICI charges\nwill be reviewed to reflect the environmental cost of sanitary disposal, especially for biomedical\nand hazardous wastes. A direct user charge for solid waste collection for residences is the\n\n\f11\n\nideal long-term goal, but political resistance to implement this charge, in addition to the water\nsupply and sewerage charges, would be insurmountable at this time. Therefore, the 15 percent\nallocation from the consolidated rate charge will be retained for SWM activities for the short- to\nmedium-term.\n\n40.\nInstitutional Development. CMC has indicated its intention to establish a water supply\nand sewerage utility, which will operate on corporate principles. This type of reform requires a\nthorough assessment of the water supply subsector, and an implementation program spanning\nseveral years. The current World Bank study will prepare a framework for the reform program,\nincluding  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  subsector,  and  the  compilation  of  a  comprehensive\nconsumer  database.  The  success  of  the  policy  and  institutional  reform  agenda  under  the\nProject will be reinforced by the expected outcomes of the World Bank study.\n\n41.\nCMC has noted that the satisfactory operation of the sewerage component of the Project\nrequires  water,  which  would  normally  be  supplied  from  a  reticulated  system.  Current\nassessments show that coverage levels are quite high, and the mayor announced in his budget\nspeech  on  11  March  2000  that  a  substantial  amount  would  be  invested  in  water  supply\ndevelopment  in  the  next  fiscal  year  in  the  project  area,  with  a  plan  to  invest  even  more  in  the\nfuture. CMC has a medium-term investment plan, including sources of funding for water supply\nand sewerage, indicating investment in the project area.\n\n42.\nBecause  of  the  considerable  demand  for  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the\ngreater Calcutta area, the government established the CMDA as a metropolitan implementing\nagency  with  access  to  central  Government  and  external  funding  for  major  water  supply  and\nsewerage infrastructure development. For this purpose, the CMDA has specifically established\nthe Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Authority, under the CMDA umbrella. Following\nimplementation,  CMC  becomes  the  operator  of  the  assets  within  its  area  of  jurisdiction.\nAlthough  CMC  is  bound  by  this  regulatory  requirement,  it  will  not  assume  ownership  of  the\nasset until it is operating satisfactorily. Consequently, many assets remain under the control of\nthe CMDA. CMC has now agreed to develop a time-bound program for transfer of the backlog\nof  assets,  including  actions  to  be  undertaken.  CMC  understands  that  the  enhanced  levels  of\ncost  recovery  resulting  from  the  Project  will  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  newly  acquired\nassets.  The  responsibility  for  all  health  and  slum  improvement  programs  implemented  by\nCMDA is now with CMC.\n\nDecentralization. In terms of its functions, CMC will assume a greater role in planning\n43.\nits  urban  areas  in  the  future,  in  accordance  with  the  74th  CAA.  Following  the  municipal\nelections  in  June  2000,  ADB  was  informed  that  a  metropolitan  planning  committee  is  now\nbeing established, and that CMC would be represented on this committee. This will give CMC\na much greater role in the planning of its urban area.\n\n44.\nGovernance. CMC is the largest municipal administration in India and has over 42,000\nstaff.  Although  its  responsibilities  are  considerable,  CMC  recognizes  that  it  is  overstaffed.  A\nmajor cause of the overstaffing is the practice of staff handing down their positions to relatives\nand  friends  upon  retirement.  CMC  issued  a  directive  in  February  2000  ceasing  this  practice.\nCMC\u2019s  total  staff  number  will  decline  through  natural  attrition  in  the  next  few  years.  This\nrationalization process will be accompanied by a reorganization of CMC and redeployment of\nits  staff  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  future.  CMC\u2019s  workforce  is  to  be  reduced  by  least  10\npercent  by  FY2007.  Guided  by  the  loan  covenants,  and  assisted  by  the  extensive  capacity\nbuilding program under the Project, CMC will develop into an efficient and autonomous\n\n\f12\n\nmegacity  corporation.  New  accounting  and  auditing  systems  will  be  installed,  together  with\nasset  management  systems,  and  geographic  and  financial  management  information  systems\n(MISs).\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n45.\nCalcutta  Municipality  was  selected  as  a  high  priority  for  ADB  assistance  in  the  urban\nsector because it (i) suffers from severe environmental problems, (ii) has a high percentage of\npoor  people,  (iii)  has  a  municipal  corporation  that  has  implemented  progressive  urban\ngovernance  reforms  in  recent  years,  (iv)  has  demonstrated  willingness  to  implement  further\nreforms, and (v) will serve as a useful model for other large municipalities.\n\nThe  Calcutta  Municipality  can  be  broadly  classified  into  an  inner  core  area  where\n46.\npopulation  densities  are  very  high,  and  the  outer  urban  areas  where  populations  are  less\ndense.  The  urban  environmental  infrastructure  in  the  inner  core  area  is  among  the  oldest  in\nIndia, with some drainage systems around 140 years old, and in urgent need of rehabilitation\nand  upgrading.  In  the  outer  fringe  areas,  sewerage  and  drainage  infrastructure  is  seriously\ndeficient. Reticulated water supply systems cover around 30 percent of the 1.4 million people\nin the project area, and a further 43 percent have tubewell supplies. Groundwater supplies are\nbeing gradually replaced by reticulated systems, as more booster pumping stations and mains\nare constructed. Although water supply coverage is improving, substantial further investment is\nneeded. CMC has agreed to provide ADB with a detailed investment plan for water supply over\nthe next five years, which will demonstrate how full coverage will be achieved.\n\nThe  population  density  of  the  inner  urban  areas  of  Calcutta  is  very  high  at  around\n47.\n29,000  people/km2,  falling  to  around  7,000/km2  in  the  outer  areas.  The  density  distribution  is\npresently skewed toward the inner core area and some outer areas, where densities are up to\nfour  times  more  than  can  be  supported  on  a  sustainable  basis.  Population  densities  are\nexpected  to  become  more  even.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  population  of  the  project  area  is\nexpected to increase by 2.5 percent per annum, to 1.88 million by 2011. Urban infrastructure\ndeficiencies are clearly evident in the outer areas\u2014only 32 percent of the outer population are\nconnected to a water system and 18 percent to a sewerage system, less than 50 percent of the\narea  is  covered  by  a  drainage  system,  and  under  70  percent  of  the  area  is  served  by  solid\nwaste  collection.  Industrial  wastes  flow,  largely  untreated,  into  the  surrounding  environment,\nexposing  the  community  to  acids,  toxic  chemicals,  paints,  varnish,  and  other  highly  toxic\ncompounds.\n\n48.\nBecause Calcutta\u2019s terrain is very flat, stormwater and sewage have to be pumped into\nreceiving waters. During the wet season, flooding is exacerbated by undersized drains, drains\nblocked  by  uncollected  solid  waste,  and  silted  canals.  The  frequent  flooding  increases\nexposure  to  pathogens  from  overflowing  septic  tanks,  flooded  garbage  heaps,  and  other\nsources, and is most severe in the low-lying slum areas.\n\nThe  population  density,  typical  of  slum  settlements,  remains  a  major  public  health\n49.\nconcern  with  regard  to  the  transmission  of  communicable  diseases,  especially  tuberculosis.\nAround 50 percent of the target population in the project area live in slum housing or worse;\n\n\f13\n\nthis represents around 700,000 people. About 26-30 percent of the slum dwelling households\nin the target area fall below the poverty line\u2014this is about 180,000-210,000 people, or 13-15\npercent of the total population in the project area.8 Low-income or slum settlements comprise\nregistered  bustees  (20  percent  of  the  target  population),  refugee  colonies  (2  percent),\nunregistered bustees and canal bank settlements (10 percent), and the homeless (1 percent).\nInadequate shelter compounds the poor environmental health conditions in the slum areas. Of\nthe total slum population in the project area, around 70 percent occupy a single room structure,\nand  around  80  percent  occupy  dwellings  of  36  square  meters  (m2)  or  less.  Smoke  from  the\nburning  of  dung,  wood  fuel,  coal,  and  kerosene  inside  slum  dwellings  predisposes  occupants\nespecially  young  children  and  women,  to  acute  respiratory  infections  (ARIs).  Although  CMC\u2019s\ndatabase on public health is very limited, it shows that mortality rates due to ARI and diarrhea\naccount for around 29 percent of all infant deaths.9\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n50.\nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Project  is  human  development,  with  environment  as  the\nsecondary objective. The specific objectives of the Project are to (i) improve the environmental\nconditions  in the  outer  areas  of  Calcutta; (ii) reduce poverty in the low-income areas through\naffordable  access  to  basic  urban  services;  (iii)  facilitate  community  empowerment  through\nparticipatory processes; (iv) protect the environment from adverse developmental impacts; and\n(v)  help  CMC  develop  as  a  proficient  and  autonomous  municipality.  The  Project  covers  the\nhighest priority investments under the Municipal Calcutta Environment Improvement Program,\nwhich is a long-term master plan prepared under ADB TA. The project area covers boroughs I,\nXI,  XII,  XIII,  XIV,  and  XV  (outer  areas  of  Calcutta  municipality)  for  parts  B,  D  and  E  of  the\nProject,  with parts A,  C  and  F  covering all boroughs within the municipality (the project parts\nare described in detail below). The total population of the outer area is about 1.4 million people,\nwhereas  the  total  population  of  Calcutta  municipality  is  around  5.0  million.  The  number  of\npeople  expected  to  benefit  directly  from  the  Project  ranges  from  65,000  to  5.0  million  across\nthe  various  components.  The  Project  will  support  CMC  in  developing  a  sustainable  urban\ngovernance  framework  in  accordance  with  the  intent  and  provisions  of  the  74th  CAA,  by\nestablishing frameworks and capacity building at the municipal level. It will also help improve\nthe environmental health conditions of the outer boroughs of Calcutta, including slum and low-\nincome areas. The Project has six parts. Appendix 5 provides a summary project description.\n\n1. \n\nPart A:  Stakeholder Consultation Process\n\n51.\nThe stakeholder consultation process (SCP) will promote stakeholder involvement in the\nProject  and  contribute  to  the  effective  implementation  of  the  project  investments.  The  SCP  is\ndesigned  to  ensure  stakeholder  awareness,  participation,  and  education  with  respect  to  the\nimplementation  and  management  of  the  project  facilities.  It  will  also  educate  the  communities\nabout environmental sanitation and health linkages. The project beneficiaries will be consulted\nabout project operations, as well as the implications to the community in terms of benefits and\nresponsibilities. Information about the stakeholders\u2019 needs and expectations under the Project\nwill flow to the project management teams. Using existing community networks where possible,\nstakeholders  will  be  encouraged  to  become  involved  in  the  project  design,  implementation,\nO&M, and monitoring. As a cross-cutting component, the SCP will underpin the promotion of\n\n                                                \n8 The poverty line in India is defined as income necessary to buy food to meet a daily intake of 2,400 calories of\nenergy  in  rural  areas  (2,100  calories  in  urban  areas),  and  certain  basic  nonfood  items  such  as  clothing  and\ntransportation. In monetary terms, this is about Rs300 ($6.50) for urban areas.\n\n9 Based on a pilot area program \u2013 Calcutta Slum Improvement Project.\n\n\f14\n\naffordable  access  of  the  poor  to  basic  urban  services  in  low-income  areas,  and  facilitate\ncommunity  empowerment  through  development  and  adoption  of  demand-led,  participatory\napproaches  across  all  components.  NGOs  will  be  recruited  under  part  F  to  manage  the  SCP,\ntogether with the supply of equipment, materials, and staff resources. The NGOs will work with\ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs) and other civil society organizations. The total number\nof beneficiaries is expected to be about 5.0 million.\n\n2.\n\nPart B:  Sewerage and Drainage Improvements\n\n52.\nThis  component  will  (i)  optimize  sewage  collection,  removal,  and  treatment;  and  (ii)\nreduce flooding through improved stormwater drainage. The component will cover the following\nfour areas of CMC: (i) Cossipore-Chitpur (part of borough I); (ii) Jadavpur (part of boroughs XI\nand XII); (iii) South Suburban (part of boroughs XI, XIII, and XIV); and (iv) Garden Reach (part\nof borough XV). All of these areas have inadequate sewerage and drainage systems. Although\nthese areas already have a number of sewers and drains constructed under the GAP, only a\nfew  house  connections  exist.  As  a  result,  the  GAP  systems  are  grossly  underused,  and  the\nlevels of coverage of the population are low. The Project therefore seeks to make effective use\nof the existing GAP infrastructure.\n\n53.\nThe  Project  will  (i)  optimize  sewage  interception  and  collection  systems  providing\nsecondary sewers (450 km); (ii) build trunk sewers in addition to existing GAP trunk lines (50\nkm);  (iii)  develop  separate  stormwater  drainage  systems,  including  pumping  stations,  where\nappropriate;  (iv)  connect  properties  to  the  existing  and  newly  extended  networks;  (v)\nconstruct/rehabilitate  five  pumping/lift  stations;  (vi)  upgrade  three  treatment  plants  and\nconstruct two new treatment plants where necessary; and (vii) desilt and rehabilitate selected\noutfall  canals.  Based  on  a  least-cost  analysis,  separate  sewerage  and  drainage  systems  are\nproposed  where  feasible.  Where  existing  infrastructure  dictates,  or  where  streets  are  narrow,\ncombined sewers are to be used. Where necessary, alternative engineering solutions such as\ninterceptor  tanks  and  small  bore  sewers  will  be  examined  and  used.  The  treatment  process\nproposed  is  extended  aeration.  This  type  of  treatment  is  recommended  due  to  its  simple\nrequirements  for  O&M,  sludge  digestion,  and  reduced  power  requirements.  In  addition,\nnumerous  reservoirs  and  water  bodies  in  the  CMC  area  need  urgent  attention,  as  their\nenvironmental degradation endangers public health. The exact location of the treatment plant\nand pumping station sites will be fixed during detailed design. At that time, all land acquisition\nmust comply with the agreed resettlement framework and the Bank\u2019s Resettlement Policy. The\nProject will provide for the rehabilitation of the Rabindra and Subhas lakes, both major water\nbodies in the CMC drainage area. The total number of beneficiaries is about 1.4 million people.\n\n3.\n\nPart C:  Solid Waste Management\n\n54.\nPart C will introduce improvements to the municipal, hazardous, and biomedical waste\nstreams.  For  municipal  wastes,  the  component  will  (i)  enhance  stakeholder  awareness,\nincluding  informal  education  and  training  for  trash  sorters,  (ii)  extend  door-to-door  collection\nservices  to  cover  the  entire  CMC  area,  and  (iii)  encourage  waste  generators  to  manage  and\nsegregate  recyclable  and  nonrecyclable  wastes  at  source.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the\nProject  will  improve  solid  waste  transportation  by  (i)  replacing  open  containers  with  closed\ncontainers; (ii) optimizing container locations; (iii) phasing out open-back trucks, and replacing\nthem with compactor trucks; (iv) using bulldozers and other equipment necessary for efficient\nlandfill operations; (v) introducing mechanical road sweepers; and (vi) progressively phasing\n\n\f15\n\nout night soil tankers as the sewerage system is expanded. The total number of beneficiaries is\nexpected to be around 5.0 million.\n\n55. With  regard  to  municipal  waste,  the  component  is  based  on  segregation  of  waste  at\nsource,  effective  collection  of  the  various  wastes,  and  disposal  in  an  environmentally  safe\nmanner.  With  support  from  the  SCP,  waste  will  be  segregated  at  source  into  recyclable\nmaterial  (23  percent),  biodegradable  matter  (58  percent),  and  inorganic  waste  (19  percent).\nThe recyclable material will be segregated by sources, collected and removed by NGOs, and\ntransported  for  sale  to  dealers,  retailers,  and  wholesalers.  The  biodegradable  matter  will  be\nsegregated by NGOs and transported to landfill sites where it will be composted and sold. The\nremaining  inorganic  waste  material  will  be  taken  to  the  existing  landfill  sites,  which  will  be\nupgraded to assimilate the waste in an environmentally safe manner. This approach to waste\nmanagement  will  considerably  increase  the  time  the  existing  landfill  sites  can  be  used.  To\nsupplement the 700 tonnes per day composting plant at Dhapa, an additional plant is proposed\nat the same site to handle 1,150 tonnes per day.\n\n56. With regard to hazardous waste, dedicated transport vehicles will be provided, and an\nintegrated  hazardous  waste  management  facility  developed  at  the  Dhapa  landfill  site.  The\nfacilities will be equipped with adequate leachate collection and treatment.\n\nThe  major  elements  of  the  biomedical  waste  management  strategy  are  improved\n57.\nhandling and transport of the waste, and cost-effective treatment and disposal. The Project will\nfinance  dedicated  transport  vehicles  and  a  central  biomedical  waste  treatment  facility.\nBiomedical wastes will be incinerated at the central biomedical waste treatment facility at the\nDhapa  landfill.  The  larger  generators  of  biomedical  waste  will  separate  biomedical  waste  for\nrecycling  and  incineration  at  source;  this  will  be  achieved  through  extensive  stakeholder\nawareness  programs.  Nonplastic  biomedical  wastes  will  be  incinerated  at  Dhapa.  For\ngenerators of large volumes of plastic biomedical wastes, assistance will be provided to shred\nand disinfect the waste.\n\n4.\n\nPart D:  Slum Improvements\n\nPart  D  will  address  the  environmental  conditions  of  informal  and  formal  low-income\n58.\nsettlements.  The  Project  will  improve  environmental  services  in  these  settlements  including\nwater supply, drainage, and sanitation. For settlements not yet recognized by CMC, the Project\nwill support recognition through zoning, site planning, and registration of dwelling units, as well\nas  physical  investments.    The  component  will  address  the  immediate  needs  of  the  poor\nthrough a crisis management approach, and also through longer-term improvements.\n\nA crisis management approach will be adopted to address the immediate needs for\n59.\nwater  supply  and  sanitation  in  unrecognized  low-income  settlements.  Up  to  65,000  slum-\ndwellers  will  benefit  from  targeted  settlements  in  Cossipore,  Garden  Reach,  and  Jadavpur.\nCivil  works  proposed  include  (i)  provision  of  water  standposts  (9,350  units);  (ii)  construction\nand/or  conversion  of  sanitary  latrines  (4,200  units);  (iii)  construction  and/or  renovation  of\ncommunity latrines (910 units); and (iv) construction of washing/bathing platforms (430 units).\n\n60.\nLonger-term  improvements  will  include  a  wide  range  of  amenities  to  improve  the\nliving  conditions  of  slum  dwellers.  The  same  rights  and  responsibilities  that  have  been\nconveyed by CMC to registered bustee dwellers will accrue to the unrecognized slum dwellers.\nThis will be achieved through a pilot scheme to establish land titles, registration of dwellings,\nrecognition of\n\n\f16\n\nthe \n\ntenants  and \n\ntheir  access \n\ntenancy  rights,  rent  control,  and  municipal  tax  liability.  Security  of  tenure  will  enhance  the\ncreditworthiness  of \nfor  physical\nimprove \nimprovements.  A  small-scale  loan  facility  of  $60,000  will  be  established  to  finance  physical\nimprovement of slum dwellings on a pilot basis. Civil works proposed include (i) widening and\nrealignment of neighborhood access lanes (1,490 meters [m]); (ii) electric lighting to illuminate\nlanes  and  open  public  spaces  (40  poles  and  wiring);  (iii)  widening,  realignment,  and  lining  of\ndrains  (595  m);  (iv)  construction  of  sewer/drainage  lines  (380  m);  (v)  construction  of  water\nsupply lines (785 m); (vii) provision of solid waste containers (6 units); and (viii) improvements\nto  public  open  space  (3,182  m2).  An  estimated  190,000  people  will  benefit  from  improved\nfacilities under this component.\n\nfinancing \n\nto \n\n61.\nNGOs  will  be  mobilized  to  design  and  manage  the  program.  The  NGOs  will  facilitate\nconsultation,  community  mobilization,  participation  in  prioritizing  community  requirements,\nplanning  and  scheduling  of  civil  works,  management  of  the  small-scale  loan  facility,  and\nmaintenance. The NGOs will work with CBOs and other civil society organizations.\n\n5.\n\nPart E:  Canal Improvements\n\n62.\nUnder  part  E,  about  53  km  of  canals  will  be  improved.  These  canals,  which  are  the\nmajor  outfalls  for  the  sewerage  and  drainage  systems  under  part  B,  are  almost  completely\nsilted up and are very polluted. They will be dredged and desilted. Lining will be undertaken to\nimprove  hydraulic  efficiency \nin  some  areas,  and  culverts  and  bridges  will  be\nreplaced/upgraded,  as  appropriate,  to  eliminate  drainage  constrictions.  Existing  pumping\nstations will be rehabilitated and augmented and new pumping stations will be constructed to\nensure uninterrupted flow, particularly during heavy rainfall and high tide levels in the Ganges\nRiver. The canals to be improved include the Tollygunge-Panchannangram Main Channel with\nits  intercepting  and  branch  channels,  the  Keorapukur  Canal  and  its  tributaries,  the  Begore\nCanal, the Manikhali Canal, and the Churial Canal. The sediment material, from dredging the\ncanals and desilting the sewers and drains will be screened for a wide range of contaminants.\nContaminated sediment will be transported to a secure landfill site at Dhapa. Uncontaminated\nsediment may be used as construction fill material.\n\nImprovement of the canals will require the resettling about 11,000 people living on the\n63.\ncanal  banks.  Dwellings  and  privies  on  canal  banks  constrict  canal  flows,  leading  to  the\naccumulation  of  silt  and  vegetation,  and  prevent  regular  cleaning  and  maintenance.  Because\nthe canals need to be dredged and desilted regularly, some of the current encroachers must be\npermanently relocated. The Project will examine ways of involving canal bank dwellers in the\nlong-term  management  and  maintenance  of  the  canals  wherever  possible.  The  resettlement\nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary Resettlement Policy  (1995)  and\nguidelines outlined in the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998).\n\n6.\n\nPart F:  Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building\n\nCMC  has  substantial  experience  in  municipal  management.  However,  constrained\n64.\ninvestment levels in the past have not permitted its staff to gain experience implementing big\nprojects, although they have implemented many small- to medium-sized projects. The Project\nwill  supplement  CMC\u2019s  resources  with  project  management  consultants,  comprising\ninternational and domestic experts. The consultants will also provide specific support to the\n\n\f17\n\nIrrigation  and  Waterways  Department  (IWD),  although  this  will  be  limited,  because  IWD  has\nsubstantial experience in canal development and rehabilitation.\n\n65.\nA  team  of  domestic  consultants  will  carry  out  the  geodetic  survey  and  detailed  design\nand construction supervision. For the sewerage and drainage component, in-depth appreciation\nof  the  dynamics  of  the  complex  systems  is  required  before  detailed  design  can  proceed.  A\ndynamic flood study of the sewerage and drainage system will therefore be included as part of\nthe detailed design consulting services package.\n\nA  local  NGO  will  be  engaged  to  manage  the  SCP.  The  NGO  will  be  experienced  in\n66.\nworking  with  government  agencies  and  communities \nimplementing\nenvironmental  and  slum  improvements  projects,  and  preferably  will  have  had  experience  with\nresettlement. The NGO will facilitate the implementation of the resettlement programs for CMC\nand IWD. To ensure the public is fully aware of the Project and its implications for civil society in\ngeneral, a public relations agency will be recruited to provide professional media management\nfor the Project.\n\nin  planning  and \n\n67.\nDue  to  a  lack  of  funding,  CMC\u2019s  staff  have  not  been  able  to  develop  CMC\u2019s\nmanagement systems and skills to a level commensurate with the largest municipality in India.\nIn  addition,  CMC  has  not  yet  developed  the  community  consultation  skills  or  participatory\nsystems  to  adequately  meet  the  needs  of  civil  society.  A  capacity  building  program  will\ntherefore  be  implemented,  and  consulting  services  (international  and  domestic)  will  be\nengaged  to  deliver  the  program  (para.  82)  The  capacity  building  program  will  be  funded  by\nDFID under a parallel financing arrangement, and administered by ADB.\n\n68.\nPart F will provide a substantial and fully equipped office for CMC and its consultants for\ntheir project activities. An office of a more modest nature will be necessary for IWD, for the canal\nrehabilitation component. Part F will provide vehicles and minor equipment for the Project, and\nincremental  administration  costs  associated  with  the  Project,  logistics,  training,  and  other\nsupport.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n69.\nThe  TA  conducted  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  combined  and  separate  sewerage\nsystems,  based  on  considerations  such  as  (i)  existing  sewerage  and  drainage  systems,  (ii)\nadequacy  of  road  width  for  laying  new  sewers/drains,  (iii)  degree  and  type  of  present  and\nfuture  urban  development,  (iv)  location  of  major  drains  and  outfall  canals,  and  (v)  land\navailability for treatment plants and pumping stations. The comparison of the cost-effectiveness\nof alternative designs indicated that the best approach generally would use separate sewerage\nand  drainage  systems,  but  that  combined  sewers  may  be  the  most  suitable  option  in  some\ncases. Partly combined systems were found to be unsatisfactory. The Project will include the\nconstruction  of  sewage  treatment  plants,  which  will  use  the  extended  aeration  treatment\nprocess  in  preference  to  the  activated  sludge  process  model.  Extended  aeration  is\nrecommended  due  to  its  simple  requirements  for  O&M,  sludge  digestion,  lower  power\nrequirements,  and  easier  laboratory  control.  The  Project  will  require  the  treatment  process  at\nthe South Suburban East sewage treatment plants to be changed to aerated lagoons, as the\ncurrent anaerobic process is not consistent with Government guidelines, 1993.\n\n\f18\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $360 million equivalent including duties and\n70.\ntaxes. Of the total cost, $103.7 million (29 percent), is the foreign exchange cost, including $38.1\nmillion  in  capitalized  interest,  and  $256.3  million  equivalent  (71  percent)  is  the  local  currency\ncost. DFID is providing a further $30 million for a comprehensive capacity building program for\nCMC to support the project investments. Table 1 summarizes the cost estimates. Detailed cost\nestimates are provided in Appendix 6.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nA.\n\nBase Costa\n\nPart A: Stakeholder Consultation Process\nPart B: Sewerage and Drainage Improvements\nPart C: Solid Waste Management\nPart D: Slum Improvements\nPart E: Canal Improvements\nPart F: Implementation Assistance and Capacity\n\nB.\n\nContingencies\n\nBuildingc\n\nSubtotal\n\nPhysical contingency\nPrice contingency\n\nSubtotal\n\nC.\n\nInterest\n\nInterest during construction\n\nTotalb\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n-\n34.5\n13.8\n2.5\n-\n3.3\n\n54.0\n\n5.4\n6.2\n11.6\n\n38.1\n\n103.7\n\n0.3\n110.4\n17.8\n8.6\n44.5\n14.9\n\n196.5\n\n19.7\n22.6\n42.3\n\n17.5\n\n256.3\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n0.3\n144.9\n31.6\n11.1\n44.5\n18.1\n\n250.5\n\n25.1\n28.8\n53.9\n\n55.6\n\n360.0\n\na At November 2000 prices.\nb Includes duties and taxes estimated at $15.5 million (4.3 percent of total Project cost).\nc Excludes $30 million equivalent to be provided by DFID as a grant under a parallel financing arrangement.\nSource:  Staff estimates.\n\nE.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n71.\nThe  Government  requested  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $250.0  million  from  its  ordinary\ncapital resources, representing approximately 69 percent of the total project costs. The loan will\nbe for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years, and with interest to be determined\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate  for  US  dollar  loans.  The  loan  of\n$250.0  million  is  proposed  to  finance  $103.7  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $146.3\nmillion  equivalent of  local  currency costs. The local cost financing is proposed to cover part of\nthe costs relating to civil works, equipment, consulting services, and resettlement, but excluding\nall  land  and  duties  and  taxes.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  the  central\nGovernment. Table 2 summarizes the proposed financing plan.\n\n\f19\n\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n250.0\n\n54.6\n\n55.4\n\nPercent\n\n69\n\n15\n\n16\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n54.6\n\n55.4\n\n103.7\n\n256.3\n\n360.0\n\nSource\n\nCMC\n\nTotala\n\nState Government\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\n103.7\n\n146.3\n\na \n\nIncludes duties and taxes estimated at $15.5 million.\n\n72.\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Government  of  India.  The  loan  to  the  Government  will  be\npassed to the government of West Bengal as 70 percent debt and 30 percent grant. This will\nresult in a subsidiary loan of $175 million at an on-lending rate of 13 percent per annum for a\nperiod of 25 years, including a 6 year grace period. The remaining $75 million will be provided\nas a grant.\n\nThe government of West Bengal will on-lend the full amount of the loan to CMC on the\n73.\nsame terms. The $75 million Government grant will be passed on to CMC also as a grant. In\naddition, the government of West Bengal will provide further budgetary support of $54.6 million,\nof  which  $27.3  million  will  be  allocated  to  IWD  as  a  grant  to  meet  the  cost  of  canal\nimprovements and resettlement, and $27.3 million allocated as a grant to CMC. CMC will meet\nthe  balance  of  the  project  costs  of  $55.4  million.  The  sewerage  connections  will  be  financed\nunder  the  Project,  and  CMC  will  recover  the  cost  (estimated  at  $30  million)  from  customers\nover  a  2-3  year  period  in  accordance  with  affordability  levels.  Under  a  parallel  financing\nagreement  with  CMC,  DFID  will  provide  grant  funding  ($30  million  equivalent)  to  support  the\ncomprehensive capacity building program required to sustain the project investments.\n\n74.\nProvision  for  financing  local  currency  costs  is  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency\nfinancing policy. Because of the constraints imposed on national savings by the low per capita\nincome,  assistance  is  required  to  support  the  local  currency  costs  of  development  projects.\nFurthermore, public finances remain under severe pressure. A significant domestic resource gap\nwill  persist  for  some  time.  Based  on  these  considerations  and  the  overall  lack  of  domestic\nbudgetary resources in the sector, and given the relatively high local currency cost in a project of\nthis  nature,  ADB  assistance  for  local  currency  expenditures  related  to  the  Project  is  justified.\nADB financing of local currency costs represents 59 percent of the total loan, 57 percent of the\ntotal local currency cost, and 41 percent of the total project cost.\n\nF.\n\nExecuting Agencies\n\n75.\nThe  Project  will  have  two  executing  agencies  (EAs).  CMC  will  be  the  principal  EA,\nresponsible for parts A, B, C, D, and F. IWD of the government of West Bengal will be the EA\nfor  part  E.  Although  part  A  will  be  essentially  under  the  responsibility  of  CMC,  it  will  also\nprovide  services  to  IWD  on  the  resettlement  aspects  of  the  canal  improvements  component.\nPart  F  will  provide  support  to  IWD  in  terms  of  consulting  services  and  incremental\nadministration. CMC is very experienced with its routine municipal functions, but not with large\nprojects.  Similarly,  IWD  is  very  experienced  in  the  development  and  maintenance  of  canals\nand  waterways,  and  is  well  equipped  to  manage  the  design  of  the  proposed  dredging  and\n\n\f20\n\ndesilting of the canals. However, project management experience is limited. Therefore, CMC,\nand to a lesser extent IWD, will be supported in project management.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization and Management\n\n76.\nA steering committee will be established to generally oversee the implementation of the\nProject,  provide  guidance  on  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  ensure  provision  of  counterpart\nfunding,  and  ensure  that  the  overall  objectives  of  the  Project  are  achieved.  The  steering\ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  minister  of  municipal  affairs  and  urban  development  of  the\ngovernment  of  West  Bengal.  The  deputy  chairman  will  be  the  mayor  of  Calcutta,  and  the\nmunicipal commissioner will be the secretary. The steering committee members will include the\nsecretaries of IWD, municipal affairs and urban development, finance, land and land reforms,\nthe chairman of West Bengal pollution control board, the chief executive officer of CMDA, the\nmembers  of  mayor-in-council  for  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  the  chairmen  of  the\nboroughs within the project area.  The steering committee will meet quarterly, or as required.\n\n77.\nA project management unit (PMU) will be established in both CMC and IWD. The PMU\nin CMC will be headed by a project director, with joint commissioner rank. The PMU in IWD will\nbe headed by a project director, with chief engineer rank. The PMUs will be responsible for the\noverall management of the Project, including recruitment of consultants, procurement, project\naccounting,  land  acquisition,  monitoring  of  resettlement,  stakeholder  consultation,  slum\ndevelopment, review and approval of detailed designs, review and approval of contract awards,\nimplementation of the physical works, quality assurance, and monitoring of the institutional and\npolicy reforms. The PMUs will provide the coordination points for CMC, CMDA, the government\nof  West  Bengal,  IWD,  and  all  consultants.  Both  PMUs  will  be  staffed  with  qualified,\nexperienced, and computer-literate personnel in the fields of project management, accounting,\nengineering, and procurement. The key PMU personnel, will be sourced from line departments\nin  CMC  and  IWD,  will  be  assigned  for  the  entire  project  duration,  and  ultimately  will  be\nincorporated  into  the  organizational  structure  responsible  for  the  assets  and  systems\nimplemented under the Project. Both PMUs will be assisted in their work by the associated line\ndepartments,  the  PMC,  and  the  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants.  The  slum\nimprovements  component  will  be  implemented  with  support  from  NGOs  and  CBOs  and\nborough, and ward-level committees using the SCP.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n78.\nThe  Project  is  to  be  implemented  over  a  six-year  period,  with  consulting  services\ncommencing by mid-2001 and civil works construction starting in 2003. Completion is scheduled\nby mid-2007. The project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n79.\nGoods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Contracts  for  major  civil  works  in  excess  of  $3  million  will  follow\ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Smaller civil works packages will be done through\nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  produce  an  updated\nprocurement plan, detailing the proposed procurement for the next financial year, and\n\n\f21\n\nsubmit it to ADB by 31 May, annually. Indicative procurement packaging is shown in Appendix\n8.\n\n80.\nUtility  vehicles  and  equipment  for  packages  less  than  $0.5  million  in  value  will  be\nprocured following international shopping procedures. Minor items such as office equipment and\nconsumables (valued at less than $100,000) may be procured by direct purchase according to\nthe Government's standard procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n81.\nA  team  of  international  and  domestic  project  management  consultants  will  assist  the\nPMUs  to  implement,  manage,  and  monitor  project  activities.  A  total  of  330  person-months  of\nconsulting  services  is  required  (108  international  and  222  domestic).  A  team  of  domestic\nconsultants  for  a  total  of  1,610  person-months  is  required  for  detailed  engineering  design  and\nconstruction  supervision.  About  810  person-months  of  services  from  NGOs  will  be  required  to\nmanage  the  stakeholder  consultation  process  and  resettlement  operation.  A  public  relations\nagency  will  be  recruited  to  provide  professional  media  management  for  the  Project.  All  the\nconsulting  services  will  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\n5.\n\nCapacity Building Program\n\n82.\nA comprehensive capacity building program (CBP) to strengthen all aspects of CMC will\nbe funded through a parallel financing arrangement between DFID and CMC. The CBP will be\nan integral part of the Project, and will come within the operational responsibility of the PMU.\nThe  CBP  is  designed  to  help  CMC  meet  its  obligations  under  the  loan  covenants.  Selection\nand recruitment of consultants and procurement of all equipment and materials for the CBP will\nbe in accordance with DFID\u2019s policies and guidelines. The CBP, which has 10 packages, will\nbe  managed  and  coordinated  through  a  CBP  manager  who  will  be  responsible  to  the  PMU.\nOverall administration of the CBP will be undertaken by ADB as part of the routine loan review\nmissions.  The  CBP  manager  is  provided  for  as  one  of  the  packages  of  the  CBP.  A  total  of\n1,788 person-months (356 international, 1,432 domestic) is to be provided for the CBP. The CBP\nwill (i) develop and implement an institutional and organizational plan; (ii) computerize CMC\u2019s\noperations;  (iii)  develop  and  implement  a  geographic  information  system;  (iv)  develop  and\nimplement  an  integrated  financial  MIS;  (v)  develop  and  implement  an  integrated  asset\nmanagement system; (vi) develop and implement a composite area-linked system for the levy\nof  property  taxes;  (vii)  develop  and  implement  a  preventive  O&M  program,  with  particular\nemphasis on health and safety, and effluent monitoring; (viii) develop and adopt urban poverty\nreduction  approaches  within  the  Bustee  Services  Cell;  (ix)  develop  and  implement  a  human\nresources  development  program;  and  (x)  establish  the  CBP  manager.  Package  (viii)  will  also\ndevelop  a  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  for  the  government  of  West  Bengal,  including\nimplementation  guidelines  and  capacity  building  for  its  implementation.  DFID  are  currently\nconsidering  expanding  the  scope  of  the  CBP,  before  formalizing  agreement  with  the\nGovernment. The agreement is linked to the Project through a cross-effectivity clause.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement and Imprest Fund Account\n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\n\n83.\nHandbook. To expedite implementation of the Project through the timely release of funds, an\n\n\f22\n\nimprest account may be established for each of EA for the exclusive use of the Project. Imprest\naccounts  will  be  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Borrower and ADB. The\ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  be  determined  by  the  Bank  in\nconsultation  with  the  Borrower.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  may  be  used  for\nreimbursement and liquidation of the imprest account for eligible expenditures up to a maximum\nof $50,000 per expenditure.\n\n7.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n84.\nFor the sewerage and drainage component, the project proposals will require about 220\nhectares (ha) of land. Approximately 180 ha are required for SWM, but this land is available at\nthe  Dhapa  landfill  site.  The  remaining  40  ha  is  required  for  the  sewerage  and  drainage\ncomponent.  The  exact  locations  of  land  requirements  could  not  be  identified  during  project\npreparation, although land areas and approximate locations are known. A detailed description\nof  land  acquisition  procedures  is  in  Appendix  9.  The  procedures  for  land  acquisition  will\ncommence  immediately  following  the  system  operational  analysis  in  the  early  stages  of\ndetailed design. Compulsory land acquisition will be undertaken either on application by CMC\nto the state government under the 1980 CMC Act and the 1894 Land Acquisition Act, or by the\nstate  government  of  its  own  accord  under  the  1894  Land  Acquisition  Act.  Adequate  time  for\ninvoluntary\nland  acquisition \nresettlement  be  involved,  a  resettlement  plan  must  be  prepared  and  implemented  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines.\n\nimplementation  schedule.  Should \n\nis  provided \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nin \n\nSome of the illegal settlers along the banks of the canals to be rehabilitated under the\n85.\nproject  must  be  resettled.  It  is  expected  that  about  3,600  households  (about  11,000  people)\nhave to be moved. Resettlement will be undertaken in accordance with a resettlement plan that\nhas  been  prepared  and  approved  by  ADB;  a  summary  resettlement  plan  is  presented  in\nAppendix  10.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  implemented  by  the  government  of  West  Bengal\nand CMC.\n\n8.\n\nStakeholder Consultation Process\n\n86.\nDuring  project  formulation,  stakeholder  participation  was  ensured  through  open\nworkshops  and  consultations  with  beneficiary  groups  and  elected  civic  leaders.  Although\nsummarized as a discrete component under the Project, the SCP will be integrated throughout\nall components. Stakeholders will be continuously consulted during project implementation and\nmaintenance of the completed facilities, to ensure their interests have been addressed and to\nbring  about  their  greater  \"ownership\"  of  the  facilities  and  cost  recovery  measures.  Existing\nstakeholder networks will be used in the delivery of the process, and will serve as a conduit for\nthe Project. The SCP is designed to involve all stakeholders in the decision-making processes\nof planning and implementing of the Project. The SCP will also cover community awareness,\nparticipation, and environmental health education. NGOs will be recruited to manage the SCP.\nThe NGOs will be responsible to CMC and IWD, through the PMUs.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n9. \n87.\nThe  project  directors  will  be  responsible  for  providing  ADB  and  the  steering  committee\nwith quarterly progress reports on project implementation. The reports will be prepared by the\nPMU, based on data collected from the EAs. The reports will particularly address the\n\n\f23\n\ninstitutional and policy development aspects of the Project. They  will  provide  a  description  of\nprogress,  details  of  any  modifications  required  to  project  schedule,  problems  encountered,\nand  institutional  and  policy  development  aspects  of  the  Project.    They  will  provide  a\ndescription of progress, details of any modifications required to the project schedule, problems\nencountered,and  an outline of the work in the ensuing quarter. The reports will also provide\nsummary financial accounts of the Project, consisting of expenditure during the quarter, year-\nto-date  expenditure,  and  expenditure  to  date.  The  EAs  will  also  submit  to  ADB  within  three\nmonths  of  substantial  physical  completion  of  Project,  a  completion  report  that  will  cover  the\ndetails  of  implementation,  costs,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  activities,  and  other\ninformation reasonably requested by ADB.\n\n88.\nThe PMUs will establish and maintain accounts and records to facilitate identification of\nincome  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project,  and  will  do  this  by  the  approval  date  of\nprequalification  documents  for  civil  works.  The  PMUs  will  contain  an  adequate  number  of\nsuitably qualified accounting staff. All the accounts and statements of expenditure and revenues\nwill  be  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  financial  statements  and\nsubproject accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within 12 months of\nthe  close  of  the  financial  year.  The  responsibility  for  preparing  all  reports,  accounts,  and\nstatements,  and  ensuring  that  they  are  submitted  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  time  frame,\nwill rest with the project director.\n\n10.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n89.\nTo ensure that project facilities are managed efficiently and that the benefits reach the\ntarget  groups,  a  BME  program  is  included  under  the  Project.10  This  program  will  monitor  the\ndelivery of services anticipated and measure benefits as they accrue. To measure the health\nand  social  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  carry  out  periodic  surveys  to\ndetermine  the  changes  in  key  social  indicators  over  time,  including  health,  welfare,  and\neconomic  and  physical  conditions.  The  indicators  to  be  monitored  have  been  formulated  and\nagreed  upon.  These  include  indicators  pertaining  to  environmental  improvements,  public\nhealth,  changes  in  property  values,  poverty  and  community  development,  and  operational\nefficiency of the Project. The PMU will submit a detailed implementation plan for BME and for\npreparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within six months of loan\neffectiveness.  The  PMU  will  be  assisted  by  the  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision\nconsultants in carrying out this monitoring.  The findings of periodic monitoring will be used to\nadjust  the  scope  of  project  improvements,  particularly  for  the  slum  and  community\ndevelopment components.\n\n11.\n\nMid-term Review\n\n90.\nA  comprehensive  midterm  review,  with  participation  of  senior  central  and  state\ngovernment  officials  and  ADB  staff,  will  be  carried  out  after  the  Project  has  reached  the\nimplementation  stage,  at  which  time  detailed  design  is  expected  to  be  complete  and  major\ncontracts will have been awarded and commenced. This is envisaged to be about 24 months\nafter  loan  effectiveness.  The  reviewers  will  critically  evaluate  actual  project  progress,\nimplementation procedures, procurement methodology, BME activities, and the performance of\nconsultants.  Following  the  review,  corrective  measures  will  be  introduced  to  remedy  any\nidentified weaknesses.\n\n                                                \n10 BME will be undertaken within the framework of ADB\u2019s project performance monitoring system, which is currently\n\nbeing pilot tested.\n\n\f24\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n91.\nBy  reducing  pollutants  discharged,  the  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  receiving\nwaters.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  report  is  attached  as  Appendix  11.  An\nexpanded  environmental  examination  has  been  prepared,  and  is  available  for  review.  The\nrehabilitation  and  expansion  of  sewers  and  drains  will  help  improve  public  health  and  the\nquality of life of communities in the project area, and will help improve and protect the quality of\ngroundwater,  which  is  currently  being  contaminated.  The  construction  of  sewage  treatment\nplants  will  reduce  the  load  of  heavy  metals,  organic  chemicals,  and  other  potential\ncontaminants  added  to  the  city\u2019s  urban  environment.  The  livelihood  of  over  20,000  people\ndepends  on  the  nutrients  in  the  effluent  flows  to  produce  crops  and  fish.  Reduced  levels  of\npollutants  in  the  city\u2019s  effluent  discharges  will  (i)  reduce  the  potential  adverse  health  impacts\nresulting from the irrigation of crops and the farming of fish in the East Calcutta Wetlands, and\n(ii)  preserve  the  unique  biological  values  of  the  wetlands.  Rehabilitating  the  outfall  canals  in\nCalcutta  will  reduce  the  potential  for  flooding  in  the  city  and  enhance  the  quality  of  life  of\nindividuals  currently  residing  in  areas  subject  to  inundation.  An  environmental  impact\nassessment (EIA) will be carried out for all project facilities during the initial stages of detailed\ndesign, and upon identification of all land sites, before any construction commences. The EIAs\nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  and  the\nrequirements of the Borrower and the government of West Bengal.\n\n92.\nImproved  SWM  will  reduce  the  adverse  health  impacts  on  people  associated  with\nunsanitary  SWM  practices,  and  will  reduce  health  problems  caused  by  disease  vectors.  In\naddition,  improved  landfill  operations  will  reduce  the  potential  for  surface  and  groundwater\ncontamination  at  the  Dhapa  site  in  the  East  Calcutta  Wetlands,  and  the  adverse  biological\nimpacts  at  the  site.  Improving  the  management  of  biomedical  wastes  will  help  protect  the\ncommunity from infectious and injurious wastes. Improved hazardous waste management will\nsubstantially reduce the discharge of contaminants into the environment. The eventual closure\nof  the  landfill  sites  at  Dhapa  and  Noapara  (in  2012)  will  affect  the  livelihood  of  trash  sorters,\nmost of whom are women and children. CMC has prepared a rehabilitation framework, and will\nprepare  a  detailed  rehabilitation  plan  and  census  during  project  implementation.  Under  the\nProject,  immediate  measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  safer  and  more  hygienic  conditions  of\nwork for the sorters, including the provision of protective clothing and health checks.\n\n93.\nA  social  analysis  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  (Appendix\n12). The Project has been prepared on the basis of a participatory approach using stakeholder\nconsultations,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  workshops.  The  Project  is  thus  responsive  to  the\nneeds  and  preferences  of  the  stakeholders,  and  will  have  no  adverse  social  impacts.  Social\nmeasures incorporated into the Project are designed to ensure that no population groups are\ndisadvantaged, that there is equitable accessibility to municipal services, and that the services\nare affordable to the poorer groups. To ensure that the consultative process is maintained, the\nproject design includes a stakeholder consultation process.\n\nTo ensure access to the Project for all income groups, financing support schemes will\n94.\nbe  available  to  all  households  regardless  of  income.  For  sewerage  connections,  a  deferred\npayment  scheme  will  be  implemented  under  which  CMC  will  finance  the  connection  into  the\nsewerage  system  and  the  households  will  repay  CMC  through  the  consolidated  rate  charge\nsystem.  Similarly,  a  small-scale  loan  facility  will  be  established  through  which  slum  dwellers\ncan improve their housing structures. Discounts will be offered to those able to repay quickly to\nreduce the revolution time of the fund, thus making it available to a wider group of people.\n\n\f25\n\nNGOs will manage the fund under the SCP. The monthly fee for sewerage and drainage will be\nmaintained at 1.8 percent of monthly household income for the poorer groups, which will permit\nthe total cost for water supply and sanitation services to remain below the universally accepted\nguideline of 5-6 percent of household income.\n\n95.\nA  detailed  resettlement  plan,  approved  by  ADB,  has  been  prepared  for  the  settlers\nalong  the  canal  banks  who  will  be  relocated  in  a  socially  responsible  way.  The  resettlement\nplan also addresses the particular needs of the socially disadvantaged trash sorters, who will\nlose  their  means  of  income  as  the  landfill  sites  gradually  become  more  sanitary.  The\nresettlement plan also includes an approved resettlement framework, which will be followed for\nthe preparation of further resettlement plans if future land acquisition under the Project involves\nresettlement. Where resettlement is involved, relocation will be undertaken in strict accordance\nwith the ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), thus ensuring that no population group\nis disadvantaged as a result of project implementation.\n\nI.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n96.\nAn estimated 200,000 people live below the poverty line in the project area. The SCP\nand  the  CBP  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  poor  groups  through  the  development  of\nmechanisms  and  approaches  to  the  design  and  operation  of  projects,  which  will  specifically\nmake  provision  for  the  underprivileged.  In  addition,  the  SCP  will  empower  communities,\nenabling  them  to  participate  more  actively  and  constructively  in  all  civic  matters.  Up  to  5.0\nmillion  people  will  benefit  from  the  Project,  of  which  some  50  percent  reside  in  slum\nsettlements. Under the CBP, skills will be developed in the CMC, NGOs, and CBOs to ensure\nthe  effective  delivery  of  such  approaches,  and  systems  will  be  institutionalized  under  the\nProject.  This  approach  will  also  empower  civil  society  in  general.  Extending  access  to  the\nsewerage system and ensuring better SWM for the poor will enhance their health. The project\ninterventions  in  the  slum  communities  will  address  poverty  in  two  ways.  First,  the  slum\ncommunities  will  have  greater  access  to  basic  facilities  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation.\nSecond, the standard of shelter in the slums is expected to improve, as the communities will be\noffered financial assistance to rehabilitate their homes, where appropriate.\n\nThe  canal  bank  dwellers  who  are  relocated  under  the  canal  rehabilitation  works  will\n97.\nhave  improved  quality  of  life  through  the  provisions  of  the  ADB-approved  resettlement  plan.\nThe government of West Bengal and CMC have recognized this exercise as an opportunity to\nassist  the  canal  bank  dwellers  to  improve  their  standard  of  living.  The  resettlement  plan\nensures  a  minimum  standard  of  housing  for  relocation,  and  addresses  the  special  needs  of\nvulnerable  groups  such  as  children  and  female  household  heads  through  specially  designed\nrehabilitation programs.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n98.\nThe Project will improve the urban environment and enhance human capital, which will\nlead to improved health and increased productivity, particularly among the slum dwellers. In the\nlonger-term,  improved  health  will,  in  turn,  contribute  to  better  educational  standards  and\neconomic  growth.  The  SCP  will  underpin  the  sustainability  of  the  Project  through  improved\nrepresentation. In addition, the SCP will empower communities, enabling them to participate\n\n\f26\n\nmore actively and constructively on all civic matters. Up to 5.0 million people will benefit from\nthe Project, of which some 50 percent reside in slum settlements.\n\n99.\nAccessibility by the poor and underprivileged to basic services and improved shelter in\nthe  slum  settlements  will  help  them  enter  the  mainstream  of  society.  This  will  alleviate  their\npersonal  burden  and  will  provide  considerable  benefit  to  the  people  of  Calcutta  as  a  whole.\nSome 65,000 slum dwellers will benefit from direct slum intervention under the Project. Many\nmore  will  benefit  indirectly  from  improved  municipal  services,  and  improved  employment\nopportunities generated by the considerable labor requirement for the construction work.\n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Evaluation\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n100.\nThe Project will improve the living and environmental conditions in the CMC area. The\nsewerage,  drainage  and  canal  components  (parts  B  and  E)  will  benefit  approximately  1.4\nmillion  people  of  the  outer  areas  of  Calcutta.  The  SCP,  SWM  and  capacity  building\ncomponents  (parts  A,  C,  and  F)  will  benefit  all  of  CMC,  with  an  estimated  population  of  5.0\nmillion. The slum improvements component (part D) will benefit 190,000 people. The economic\ncapital costs and incremental O&M costs of all components have been considered. Per capita\nvalues for each economic benefit have been calculated and multiplied by the target population\nin each case.\n\n101.\nThe  main  economic  benefit  of  the  Project  is  improved  human  health.  The  Project  will\nreduce  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases  due  to  reduced  flooding,  installation  of\nsewerage  systems,  and  improved  SWM.  Cost  savings  will  include  reduced  (i)  hospital  and\nhealth care; government expenditure on (ii) household medical expenditure; and (iii) expenses\nfor  cleaning  septic  tanks;  removing  solid  waste  dumped  into  the  canals;  and  repairing  roads,\nvehicles, and dwellings due to flood damage. Reduced flooding also will save time in travelling\nto  work,  and  benefits  will  be  obtained  from  recycling  and  composting  solid  waste.  Benefits\narising  from  the  Project  that  are  difficult  to  value  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  the\npopulation  of  Calcutta.  These  benefits  include  increases  in  land  values,  reduction  of  flood\nimpacts on economic activities, benefits to people resident outside the CMC area, benefits to\nvisitors, and the psychological benefits of reduction in morbidity and mortality.\n\n102. An  integral  economic  analysis  has  been  made  for  the  Project  as  a  whole,  excluding\ncomponent  A.  The  economic  analysis  is  presented  in  detail  in  Appendix  13.  The  aggregate\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) obtained for the Project is 14.5 percent, which is higher\nthan the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. The economic net present value of\nthe  Project  has  been  calculated  for  discount  rates  of  10  and  12  percent.  In  both  cases,  it  is\npositive. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the EIRR is most sensitive to delays in\nthe  realization  of  benefits.  However,  the  EIRR  remains  above  12  percent  in  all  sensitivity\nanalyses.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Sustainability\n\na. \n\nCurrent Financial Practices and Position of CMC\n\n103. A financial analysis is presented in Appendix 13. While CMC follows generally accepted\naccounting principles, because CMC lacks computerized accounting systems, it relies on cash-\n\n\f27\n\nbased financial reporting rather than accrual accounting procedures. This system has a limited\nability to track and manage receivables and payables, and CMC urgently needs to implement a\nfull  accrual  based  accounting  system.  All  CMC  revenues  are  credited  to  the  municipal  fund.\nThe CMC Act, 1980, requires that the municipal fund be maintained in five accounts covering a\nrange  of  urban  services  which,  as  yet,  excludes  SWM.  A  separate  account  for  SWM  is\nessential if this activity is to be operated on corporate principles.\n\n104. CMC\u2019s  operations  are  funded  by  state  government  transfers  and  locally  generated\nrevenue. Historically, the state transfers have included a cost-of-living allowance, octroi motor\nvehicles  tax,  entertainment  tax,  grants  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations  (on  a\nmatching grant basis), bustee services (on a matching grant basis), development grants, and\nproject-specific  grants.  The  most  important  transfers  are  the  cost-of-  living  adjustments;  and\nthe  development  grant,  which  is  paid  in  lieu  of  the  abolished  octroi.  For  FY2000,  these\ntransfers represented 89 percent of the total state transfers.\n\n105. Records show that the state was not always able to transfer the required amount. This,\ntogether with inadequate financial management, resulted in CMC running operating deficits of\n33-48 percent between 1993 and 1998. Following the abolition of the octroi, and motor vehicle\ntax,  and  the  adoption  of  the  State  Finance  Commission\u2019s  recommendations  (1995)  in  the\nbudget for FY2000, the state transfers have been rationalized, and include (i) allocation of 16\npercent of sales tax to local bodies as untied funds (CMC to receive 3.9 percent), (ii) cost-of-\nliving allowance to cover 100 percent of CMC\u2019s liability, (iii) all state taxes on entertainment to\nbe handed over to the local bodies, (iv) CMC empowered to issue trade licenses, and (v) CMC\nmay  impose  higher  tolls  on  heavy  vehicles  (still  under  consideration).  The  provision  of\nmatching grants for water supply, sewerage, and bustees will likely cease.\n\n106. CMC generates its local revenue through a mix of direct user charges, rents or leases,\nand taxes. For water supply, user charges are applied to water consumers having a connection\nof 20 mm or greater; for sewerage, charges are applied to ICI users; and for SWM, charges are\nalso applied to ICI establishments. Rents are received from the leasing of markets and, more\nrecently,  payments  are  being  received  from  some  build-own-transfer  schemes.  There  are  a\nvariety of taxes, but by far the most significant is the consolidated rate charge, which accounts\nfor some 26-36 percent of total revenue; the sum of all taxes amounts to about 37-42 percent\nof total revenue. However, the locally generated revenues only recover around 20 percent of\nwater supply services, 3-7 percent of sewerage and drainage, and almost nothing for SWM. In\ntotal in FY2000, user fees for water supply, sewerage, and SWM represented only 9 percent of\nestimated revenues.\n\n107. Since  FY1995,  recurrent  expenses  for  water  supply  have  been  in  the  range  of  9-15\npercent of total expenditure, 7-10 percent for sewerage and drainage, 17-22 percent for SWM,\nand 3-17 percent for bustee services. Locally generated revenues are providing an increasing\nshare  of  total  revenues,  but  this  is  because  the  state  transfers  have  been  decreasing  in\nabsolute terms. Since FY1994, internally generated revenue has risen from 52 to 60 percent of\ntotal  revenue.  It  is  becoming  increasingly  necessary  for  CMC  to  reduce  its  dependence  on\nstate transfers to bring about a real improvement in Calcutta\u2019s urban environment.\n\n108. Although  the  general  ledger  and  trial  balance  (cash)  are  computerized,  most  other\naccounting functions are manual. The CMC Act, 1980, provides for audit of CMC\u2019s accounts,\nbut does not set any time limit for the preparation of financial accounts by CMC, for completion\nof the audit. The delayed preparation and audit of accounts means that proper financial\n\n\f28\n\ninformation is not available on a timely basis. This is of some concern, as CMC has substantial\narrears. The audit of the accounts for FY1991 has only just been completed by a private firm\non behalf of CMC. CMC advised ADB that this will now allow the completion of the accounts for\nthe following fiscal year (FY1992) and their subsequent audit, and so on. Due to the lack of up-\nto-date  financial  data,  CMC\u2019s  annual  budgetary  statements  of  receipts  and  expenses  (both\ncapital and operational) must be relied upon when reviewing past financial performance. CMC\ndoes,  however,  provide  unaudited  copies  of  its  income  statement  (cash  basis,  excluding\ndepreciation)  within  12  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  the  examiner  of  local  fund\naccounts, government of West Bengal.\n\n109. Computerized information of receipts and expenditures for the last three financial years\nis  available,  whereas  prior  to  FY1996,  only  estimates  are  available.  A  review  of  CMC\u2019s  past\nfinancial  performance  for  these  three  years  (actuals)  of  computerized  data  shows  that  in\nFY1997  (year  ending  31  March  1997)  and  FY1998,  CMC  achieved  a  cash  surplus  from  its\noperations  of  $4.4  million  equivalent  and  $2.3  million  equivalent,  respectively.  In  FY1999  an\noperating deficit of $12.7 million equivalent was incurred, which was met from additional State\ntransfers.  This  is  less  than  the  projected  budgeted  deficit  of  $14.7  million  equivalent,  but  is\nsubstantially  different  to  the  estimated  results  for  FY1999,  which  indicated  a  surplus  of  $3.3\nmillion equivalent. For FY2000, a deficit of $15.0 million equivalent is expected.\n\nThe consolidated rate charge is an area of concern, as it could be a substantial source\n110.\nof  revenue  for  CMC.  Currently,  it  is  the  single  largest  source  of  tax  revenue  for  CMC,  but\ngenerates  the  lowest  revenues  per  capita  among  India\u2019s  major  cities.11  However,  there  has\nbeen  major  progress  since  1998  when  CMC\u2019s  master  record  files  were  computerized.  The\nconsolidated  rate  charge  arrears  are  now  computerized  and  statements  issued.  Accordingly\ncollection efficiency of present demand bills is above 60 percent, and receipts have been rising\nat  15  percent  per  annum  over  the  last  five  years.  The  method  CMC  uses  for  determining\nannual  valuations  for  the  consolidated  rate  charge  is  to  value  properties  on  their  estimated\nARV,  assessed  at  fair  rental  rates.  With  this  method,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  achieve  full\nmarket  rental for a property,  as the level of rent is limited by legislation, thereby constraining\nrevenue (para. 36).\n\nb. \n\nAssumptions and Bases for the Financial Projections\n\n111.\nThe  proposed  funding  and  cost  recovery  mechanisms  for  Calcutta\u2019s  sewerage  and\ndrainage are the implementation of a two-part fee structure. The system is based on a water\ntariff  surcharge  and  the  allocation  of  a  fixed  percentage  of  the  consolidated  rate  charge\ncollections  to  cover  all  recurrent  costs  and  some  capital  cost  of  sewerage  and  drainage\nfacilities.  The  SWM  component  includes  3  subcomponents:  municipal  waste  management,\nbiomedical  waste,  and  hazardous  waste.  The  assumptions  and  bases  for  the  financial\nevaluation are designed to ensure CMC\u2019s financial sustainability, while maintaining affordable\ncharges and taxes. The key financial assumptions and bases are discussed in paras. 112-118.\n\nc. \n\nAffordability and Willingness to Pay\n\n112.\nThe  financial  projections  are  presented  on  a  fiscal  year  basis,  ending  on  31  March.\nProjections are prepared to FY2012 and are, of necessity, based in part on actual, estimated,\nand budgeted financial data. Inflation has been projected at the local rate, and state domestic\n\n                                                \n11 Second Municipal Finance Commission, Government of West Bengal.\n\n\f29\n\nproduct growth has been assumed at 6.7 percent with the assumption that most revenues and\ncosts will increase at around half this rate in real terms at 3.35 percent per annum.  Population\ngrowth, although quite low at around 0.6 percent for CMC as a whole, is projected to increase\nat around 2.5 percent per annum in the project area. The consolidated rate charge collection\nefficiency is projected to increase to 80 percent by FY2005, and the method of assessment is\nexpected to be reformed by FY2003 (para.36). All water supply consumers with a connection\nof 20 mm dia. or greater, will be required to pay a minimal charge, and a 50 percent surcharge\nfor  sewerage  and  drainage  by  FY2002.  The  cost-of-living  allowance  will  continue  to  cover\nCMC\u2019s full liability. The government of West Bengal will transfer 3.9 percent of the state\u2019s tax\nrevenue annually to CMC under the agreed tax sharing arrangement.\n\n113. A  typical  water  supply  or  sewerage  connection  can  serve  the  needs  of  several\nhouseholds. About 18 percent of the population (250,000 people) in the project area are served\nby the sewerage system, and each connection typically serves 2.5 households. Adopting this\nratio,  and  an  urbanization  rate  of  2.5  percent  per  annum  in  the  project  area,  the  number  of\nsewerage  connections  in  the  project  area  will  reach  100,000  by  FY2007,  covering  some  60\npercent of the target population.\n\n114. Based on the universally adopted guideline that the total cost of direct user charges for\nwater  supply  and  sanitation  services  should  not  exceed  of  5-6  percent  of  monthly  household\nincome, affordability levels have been examined. Water tariffs will be increased over the next\nfew years, but the exact level is not yet known. Based on ADB\u2019s general experience however,\nwater supply and sanitation each represent about 50 percent of the total. Therefore, sanitation\ncharges should not exceed 2.5 percent of monthly household income. Based on this premise,\ntwo  representative  income  levels  are  considered  in  the  affordability  analysis.  The  first  is  the\nmedian household income level (Rs3,700 per month in 1999). The second is the income level\n(Rs2,670 and below in 1999), below which community water standpipes and latrines would be\nthe affordable and appropriate option.\n\n115. Costs for sewerage and drainage will be partly recovered through the consolidated rate\ncharge, and partly through a direct user charge. The monthly direct user charge is projected for\nthe years FY2002 (year of introduction), FY2006, and FY2016, and expressed as a ratio of the\nprojected  median  and  lower  bound  income,  respectively.  In  FY2002,  the  user  charge  would\nrepresent 1.1 percent and 1.6 percent; in FY2006, it would represent 1.3 and 1.8 percent; and\nin  FY2011,  it  would  represent  1.2  and  1.6  percent.  All  of  these  ratios  are  substantially  below\nthe  affordability  limit  of  2.5  percent.  If  the  consolidated  rate  charge  (indirect  recovery)  is  also\nconsidered,  then  based  on  a  15  percent  allocation  of  the  average  tax  of  Rs600/annum,  or\nRs50/month, the indirect charge would represent 1.3 percent of the median household income.\nWith  respect  to  the  poorer  groups,  the  lowest  level  of  consolidated  rate  charge  payable  is\ncurrently Rs300/annum, which is considered to be the cut-off point for poor households; below\nthis level poor households are exempt from the consolidated rate charge. For the median case\ntherefore, the sum of direct and indirect user charges will represent 2.6 percent of household\nincome,  and  for  the  poorer  groups  the  direct  user  charge  will  represent  1.8  percent  of\nhousehold  income.  On  this  basis  the  proposed  cost  recovery  mechanisms  are  considered\naffordable.\n\n116.\nIndirect recovery of costs for the SWM operations is proposed through the consolidated\nrate  charge  (15  percent  allocation),  as  is  currently  applied.  This  will  represent  1.3  percent  of\nthe  median  household  income.  As  with  sewerage  and  drainage,  poor  households  will  not\ncontribute because they are exempted from the consolidated rate charge.\n\n\f30\n\nd.  Cost Recovery Mechanisms\n\n117. Virtually  the  whole  water  supply  system  is  unmetered,  except  for  a  few  ICI\nestablishments. CMC has indicated its intention to implement a metering program under which\nall  unmetered  connections  will  pay  a  flat  rate  of  Rs100/month.  Once  a  meter  is  installed,  the\nconsumer is to begin paying on a progressive block rate tariff system, which will incorporate a\nlifeline charge for the poorer groups. For sewerage and drainage, a 50 percent surcharge on\nthe  water  tariff  of  domestic  consumers  and  80  percent  on  ICI  consumers  will  be  set  up  to\nrecover  part  of  the  costs.  In  addition,  15  percent  of  the  consolidated  rate  charge  will  be\nallocated for supporting water supply, 15 percent for sewerage and drainage, and 15 percent\nfor SWM.\n\n118.\nThe initial connection charge to the system will be around Rs6,000, depending on the\nlocation of the premises. It is proposed that CMC will finance the cost of connections under the\nProject,  and  recover  the  cost  through  the  consolidated  rate  charge  collection  system  and/or\nwater bills, over a two-year period.\n\nd. \n\nFinancial Evaluation\n\nFinancial projections of CMC\u2019s operations, including the proposed project investments,\n119.\nhave been prepared and evaluated to FY2012. The projections are based on the assumptions\ndiscussed  in  paras.  112-118,  the  proposed  cost  recovery  mechanisms,  proposed  operational\nrequirements, and the population forecasts and planning targets. The projections indicate that,\nas a result of the Project, CMC will become financially stronger. CMC will be able to recover all\ncurrent  and  incremental  O&M  costs,  and  service  100  percent  of  project  debt  (interest  and\nprincipal repayments) after project completion.\n\nB.\n\nRisks\n\n120.\nThrough legal due diligence during processing, ADB has sought to identify all significant\nrisks, and devise a management strategy to mitigate the risks to the proposed Project. These\nrisks relate to land acquisition, user charges, rationalization of CMC staff, property tax reform,\nand audit requirements.\n\nLand Acquisition. Some land will need to be acquired for the sewerage and drainage\n121.\ncomponent. The two risks associated with land acquisition are (i) delays in acquisition, and (ii)\nunfair compensation. These risks are mitigated by acquiring all land on a solid legal basis, for\nwhich  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  provides  the  necessary  legal  base.  The  1894  act\nprovides  for  compensation  on  a  comprehensive  basis.  The  risk  of  inappropriately  low\ncompensation triggering litigation and attendant delays is mitigated by the West Bengal Land\nAcquisition Manual of 1991, which guides the state government in calculating compensation.\n\n122. Property Tax Reform. Some reform measures are needed to improve CMC\u2019s financial\nposition.  The  basic  reform  is  to  change  the  capital  valuation  of  property  from  an  ARV  to  an\narea-based  method  of  assessment.  Therefore,  capital  valuation  of  property,  as  currently  set\nforth  in  the  CMC  Act,  should  be  implemented  by  area.  Assuming  the  legal  framework  is  set\ndown  in  a  very  clear  manner,  the  logistical  problems  of  tax  reform  will  still  need  to  be\naddressed.  This  risk  is  to  be  mitigated  through  (i)  a  comprehensive  capacity  building\ncomponent,  and  a  program  of  workshops/seminars  with  similar  progressive  municipalities  in\nBihar, Gujarat and Karnataka; and (ii) loan conditionalities.\n\n\f31\n\n123. Government of West Bengal\u2019s Public Finances. The state government is a subsidiary\nborrower  under  the  Project.  It  is  also  taking  on  debt  to  finance  other  projects  such  as  water\nsupply and highways. These investments will affect the state government\u2019s fiscal performance.\nTo  assess  the  risk  of  adverse  fiscal  impact,  ADB  assessed  the  state  government\u2019s  fiscal\nsituation.  Although  the  study  revealed  that  the  government  needs  to  improve  its  fiscal\nperformance to meet future investments, it concluded that the state can afford the Project. The\ngovernment\u2019s annual counterpart commitments represent only approximately 2.0 percent of the\ntotal  state  budget.  The  risk  of  default  on  counterpart  contributions  due  to  inadequate  fiscal\nresources is therefore minimal, and mitigated through assurances that the government will meet\nall necessary counterpart funding requirements.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nA. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n124. As  a  condition  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  the  state  government  will\nhave enacted amendments to the CMC Act, which will (i) enable CMC to issue regulations or\nadopt  budget  estimates,  requiring  all  users  to  pay  a  direct  flat  rate  surcharge  based  on\nconsumer connection size for sewerage and drainage for all unmetered water connections; (ii)\nensure  that  CMC  will  be  externally  audited  on  an  annual  basis  no  later  than  12  months  after\nthe end of each fiscal year; and (iii) enable CMC to have a separate  account for SWM as part\nof the municipal fund, and allocate 15 percent of the amounts realized from the consolidated\nrate charge to that account.\n\n125. As  further  conditions  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  (i)  the  on-lending\nagreement, satisfactory to ADB, will have been executed and delivered on behalf of the state\ngovernment  and  CMC,  and  will  have  become  fully  effective  and  binding  upon  the  state\ngovernment and CMC in accordance with its terms; and (ii) the DFID agreement will have been\nexecuted  and  delivered,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its  effectiveness  shall  have  been\nfulfilled, or arrangements satisfactory to ADB shall have been made for its fulfillment.\n\nB.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government,  government  of  West  Bengal,  and  CMC  have  given  the  following\n126.\nspecific assurances, in addition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the\nlegal documents.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government,  state  government,  and  CMC  will  execute  the  policy  and\ninstitutional action plan as agreed with them and ADB.\n\nThe Government, the state government, and CMC will ensure that water supply\ninvestments in the project area will continue to FY2007 at a level that will result\nin at least 100,000 total connections and an incremental 57,000 connections by\nthe end of that fiscal year (an average of 8,000 connections per annum).\n\nCMC  will  undertake  a  program  of  metering  of  all  water  supply  consumers  with\n20 mm connections or more. The CMC shall also take account of the ongoing\nWorld Bank studies in undertaking a program of metering all water supply\n\n\f32\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nconsumers having a connection less than 20 mm. dia. based on consumption to\nbe  agreed  with  ADB  such  that  (a)  25  percent  will  be  metered  by  the  end  of\nFY2003, (b) 50 percent by the end of FY2004, and (c) 100 percent by the end of\nFY2005. All consumers are expected to be metered by the end of FY2010.\n\nCMC will implement property tax reform acceptable to ADB by no later than the\nend  of  FY2004  in  accordance  with  actions  agreed  to  between  the  state\ngovernment, CMC, and ADB under the Policy and Institutional Reform Agenda.\n\nSubject  to  the  ongoing  World  Bank  studies  on  metering,  the  state  government\nand  CMC  will  ensure  that  a  progressive  block  rate  water  tariff  and  sewerage\nsurcharge, based on metering of water supply consumers as previously agreed\nto with ADB, will be implemented so that (i) a CMC regulation on a progressive\nblock  rate  water  tariff  and  sewerage  surcharge  will  be  approved  by  the  state\ngovernment  and  issued  by  CMC  by  the  end  of  FY2003;  (ii)  the  scope  of  the\nCMC regulation will be extended as wards are metered and a progressive block\nrate  water  tariff  and  sewerage  surcharge  is  imposed  in  the  fiscal  year\nimmediately  following  metering;  and  (iii)  the  adoption  of  the  water  tariff  and\nsewerage surcharge is completed in the CMC\u2019s jurisdictional area by the end of\nFY2008.\n\n(vi) \n\nCMC  will  ensure  that,  pending  the  progressive  block  rate  water  tariff  and\nsewerage  surcharge  as  set  out  in  the  Policy  and  Institutional  Reform  Agenda,\nthe flat rate surcharge based on consumer connection size for unmetered water\nconnections will be retained.\n\n(vii)  CMC  will  ensure  that  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  have  audited\nCMC\u2019s unaudited accounts, and

The first six loans are (i) Housing Finance (Loan 1549/1550/1551), for $300\nmillion  approved  on  25  September  1997;  closing  date  on  30  June  2003;  (ii)  Karnataka  Urban\nInfrastructure  Development  Project  (KUIDP  Loan  1415),  approved  for  $85  million  on  14\nDecember  1995;  closing  date  on  30  June  2002;  (iii)  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project (Loan 1647), approved for $250 million on 3 December 1998; closing date\non 30 June 2005; (iv) Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environmental Management\nProject  (Loan 1704), approved for $175 million on 26 October 1999; closing scheduled on 30\nJune  2005;  (v)  Urban  and  Environmental  Infrastructure  Facility  (Loan  1719/1720/1721)\napproved for $200 million on 17 December 1999; closing is scheduled for 22 September 2006;\nand  (vi)  Housing  Finance  II  (Loan  1758/1759/1760/1761)  approved  for  $300  million  on  21\nSeptember 2000; closing is scheduled for 30 June 2007. Although some lessons can be drawn\nfrom  all  these  projects,  the  KUIDP  is  most  relevant  to  the  Project,  and  provides  the  most\nlessons. The lessons learned from the other projects are very similar to those of the KUIDP.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nA.\n\n \n\n1.\n\nOverall Implementation Schedule\n\n2.\nThe appraisal schedule envisaged an implementation period of six years commencing in\nJanuary  1996  with  full  completion  of  all  KUIDP  activities  by  the  end  of  December  2001.  The\nexecuting  agency  (EA)  took  nine  months  to  mobilize  the  consultants  and  a  further  year  to\ncomplete the designs before procurement could commence. Despite delays and slow progress\nand disbursements, the EA estimates that the KUIDP will be on schedule. Thus, six years is an\nadequate  period  of  time  for  implementing  an  integrated  urban  development  project.  However,\nadvance  action  to  field  consultants  immediately  following  loan  effectiveness  would  help\nsignificantly.\n\n2.\n\nKUIDP Implementation Arrangements\n\nThe  EA  established  a  project  management  unit  (PMU).  The  PMU  is  assisted  by  an\n3.\ninternational  project  management  consultant  and  two  domestic  design  and  construction\nsupervision  consulting  firms.  A  domestic  consultant  for  the  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation\nprogram  commenced  work  in  March  1999.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  coordinating  and\nmanaging  all  KUIDP  activities,  and  coordinating  all  consulting  services.  The  delineation  of\nresponsibility  between  project  management  and  design  and  supervision  services  is  proving  to\nbe  very  effective.  The  poverty  alleviation  components  are  being  implemented  through\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations,  which  are  being\nfinanced  under  the  Project.  Even  with  the  help  of  these  grassroots  organizations,  it  has  taken\n12-18 months to gain the trust of the communities and mobilize their resources. Adequate time\nneeds  to  be  provided  to  ensure  the  true  participation  of  communities  in  projects.  Further,\nexperienced  NGOs  should  be  used.  Inexperienced  NGOs  can  cause  serious  delays  in\nmobilizing  a  program.  NGOs  have  reported  however,  that  the  KUIDP  has  generally  benefited\ntheir other development programs by legitimizing their presence, providing improved access to\nlocal governments, and generally heightening their status.\n\nThe 11 implementing agencies (IAs) in four towns are involved in executing the KUIDP.\n4.\nTo  support  the  PMU  and  the  town-level  IAs,  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  have  been\nestablished in each project town. Loan reviews revealed that the roles of the PIUs were not well\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\ndefined.  As  a  result,  the  IAs  did  not  seek/accept  support  from  the  PIUs.  Following  a  more\ndetailed  definition  of  roles,  the  arrangement  appears  to  be  working  well.  The  IAs  are  now\ndeveloping greater skills through the revised arrangements, preparing them much better to take\nover operation of the new facilities following completion of the KUIDP. The PMU, PIUs, and IAs\nmust  be  adequately  staffed  in  terms  of  capability  and  numbers,  and  continuity  of  leadership\nmust  be  maintained.  The  IAs  tend  to  suffer  from  inadequate  staffing.  Project  planning  should\ntake into consideration such constraints.\n\n3.\n\nContract Awards and Disbursements\n\n5.\nA  number  of  problems  with  procurement  of  civil  works,  engineers\u2019  estimates,  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) procedures, and quality control have been experienced under KUIDP.\nThe  tender  documents  include  a  number  of  provisions  that  differ  from  the  tender  conditions\nnormally  used  by  the  IAs,  such  as  the  cost  of  third  party  inspection,  the  risk  associated  with\nfixed  price  contracts,  the  cost  of  performance  bonds,  quality  control,  and  interest  costs.  The\ndomestic  contractors  must  be  given  very  clear \nrequirements,\nprequalification  of  contractors  must  be  undertaken  carefully,  and  greater  effort  is  required  to\neducate the contracting industry. A series of workshops may be appropriate.\n\ninstructions  on  ADB \n\nB.\n\nLand Acquisition\n\n6.\nDelayed  land  acquisition  has  delayed  the  KUIDP\u2019s  initial  implementation.  One\ncomponent  for  industrial  sites  and  services  has  been  dropped  because  the  land  could  not  be\nacquired.  The  KUIDP  experience  demonstrates  the  need  to  undertake  land  acquisition\nprocedures as early as possible to avoid delays, and consider phased conditionalities to ensure\nintermediate  procedures  are  proceeding  in  a  timely  manner.  Further,  a  solid  legal  framework\nshould be established for land acquisition during loan processing to avoid any changes to the\nscope of work during implementation as a result of failure to acquire the land needed. Based on\nthe KUIDP experience, land acquisition can take more than two years to complete.\n\nC.\n\nLegislation Amendments for Property Tax Reform\n\nUnder  the  KUIDP,  increased  revenue  generation  was  sought  through  property  tax\n7.\nreform. This comprised changing the basis of annual ratable valuation from a rental to an area\nbasis.  There  have  been  some  difficulties  in  implementing  the  reforms,  primarily  because  the\nlegal  framework  was  not  clearly  established  before  attempting  to  introduce  the  necessary\nreforms. Such legal amendments must be agreed and passed well in advance of the logistical\nmeasures required to effect such change. One successful measure taken under the KUIDP to\nimprove  property  tax  revenue  has  been  to  computerize  the  billing  and  collection,  which  has\nsubstantially increased revenue.\n\n\fPOLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM AGENDA\n\nObjective\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nFY2002\n\nFY2004\n\nFY2005\n\nAction\nFY2003\n\nSeveral recommendations were made by the State Finance Commission in 1995, designed to improve\nthe equitability of revenue sharing between the state and municipalities, including the Calcutta\nMunicipal Corporation (CMC).

The  two  possible\nalternative procedures for land acquisition under consideration are (i) negotiated acquisition by\nCalcutta  Municipal  Corporation  (CMC)  under  Section  536  of  the  CMC  Act  of  1980;  and  (ii)\ncompulsory land acquisition through a CMC application to the state government under Sections\n533 and 537 of the CMC Act of 1980, or state government compulsory land acquisition under\nthe Land Acquisition Act of 1894. Under Section 446 of the CMC Act 1980, however, the land\nacquisition powers of CMC only relate to acquisition of rights of users of bustees, and therefore\nappear not to be suitable for most project-related land acquisition. The most suitable alternative\nis compulsory land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894.\n\nB.\n\nPolicies and Procedures for Land Acquisition\n\n2.\nThe 1894 Land Acquisition Act sets forth the procedures for land acquisition. First, under\nSection 4(1) of the 1894 Act, when the state government seeks to acquire land in any locality for\nany  public  purpose  the  state  government  has  to  provide  (i)  a  publication  of  a  preliminary\nnotification in the official gazette, (ii) publication in two daily newspapers of which at least one\nwill be in the regional language, and (iii) public notice at convenient places in the locality.  After\nsuch notification, entry and surveys can be carried out by the state government in accordance\nwith  Sections  4(2)  and  5  of  the  1894  Act.  Second,  after  notification,  any  person  interested  in\nland  that  has  been  notified  can  raise  objections  under  Section  5A  of  the  1894  Act  and  will  be\nheard  by  the  collector.  No  time  is  specified  in  Section  5A  for  disposition  of  such  objections\nhearings, but the state government\u2019s decision is final at this stage. Third, under Section 6 of the\n1894 Act, the state government declares the intended acquisition, but only after it has the funds\nfor compensation payments. The declaration has to be published in the official gazette, and in\ntwo daily newspapers of which at least one shall be in the regional language, and public notice\nof the declaration has to be provided in convenient places in the locality.\n\n3.\nFourth, under Section 8 of the 1894 Act, the collector (head of the district) marks out the\nland to be acquired and under Section 9 of the 1894 Act, the collector provides public notice to\ninterested  persons  to  appear  in  person  or  by  an  agent  before  him  regarding  claims  for\ncompensation  and  objections  to  Section  8  measurement.    Under  Section  11A,  a  maximum  of\ntwo  years  is  allowed  from  the  declaration  of  intention  to  acquire  to  the  collector\u2019s  award  of\ncompensation, failing which the acquisition lapses. The collector is entitled to take possession of\nthe  land  under  Sections  16  and  17  of  the  1894  Act.  Finally  the  1894  Act  procedure  for  land\nacquisition allows the collector\u2019s award of compensation to be appealed to the courts under the\n1894  Act  Sections  18  to  28.  Appeals  to  the  district  court,  high  court,  and  supreme  court  are\npossible.  However, the risk of litigation-attendant delays are mitigated for priority acquisition of\nland such as for the proposed Project through the narrow test for such litigation in the 1894 Act\nand  adherence  by  the  collector  to  the  procedures  and  basis  for  compensation  set  forth  in  the\n1894 Act and the West Bengal Land Acquisition Manual 1991 (para. 5).\n\nSection  23  of  the  1894  Act  provides  for  compensation  on  a  comprehensive  basis\n4.\nconsisting of (i) market value of land acquired; (ii) damages for standing crops and trees on the\nland; (iii) damages for severing land when the collector takes possession of it; (iv) damages for\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nthe  acquisition  injuriously  affecting  the  person\u2019s  other  movable  or  immovable  property;  (v)\nreasonable  expenses  for  change  of  residence  or  place  of  business;  (vi)  damages  for  loss  of\nprofits  between  publication  of  the  declaration  and  the  collector\u2019s  possession  of  the  land;  (vii)\nloss  of  earnings  from  loss  of  the  land  acquired;  (viii)  12  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the\nacquired land from the publication of the notification under Section 4(1) to the date of award of\nthe Collector or taking possession of the land, whichever is earlier; and (viii) 15 percent of the\nmarket value of the acquired land for the compulsory nature of the acquisition.\n\nThe risk of inappropriately low compensation triggering litigation and attendant delays is\n5.\nmitigated by the West Bengal Land Acquisition Manual of 1991 (the Manual), which guides the\nstate government in calculating compensation. Thus, section 64 of the Manual states\u2026\u2026\u201cAs far\nas possible, everyone who is deprived of property by compulsory acquisition should be enabled\nby the compensation awarded to him to place himself in substantially the same position in which\nhe was before the acquisition\u201d\u2026.  In addition, section 68 of the manual provides for an objective\nbasis for market valuation of the land by (i) referring to the average of sales that took place at\nthe time of the notification of similar lands in the same or adjoining localities, and (ii) a review of\n15-20  deeds  executed  on  dates  immediately  before  the  relevant  date  taken  from  the  local\nsubregistry  office  for  similar  land  in  the  same  locality.  Similarly,  section  73  of  the  manual\nprovides  helpful  guidance  on  calculation  of  damages,  loss  of  earnings,  expenses,  and  loss  of\nprofits.  The  district  magistrate  responsible  for  the  district  in  which  the  majority  of  land  will  be\nacquired reports that all land acquisition is normally completed within 6-12 months.\n\nC.\n\nScale of Land Acquisition\n\nThe  precise  locations  of  the  land  areas  required  for  the  Project  cannot  be  determined\n6.\nyet.  During  the  detailed  design  process,  land  locations  will  be  finalized,  and  acquisition\nprocedures put in place.

Two project\ncomponents will require land acquisition: (i) sewerage and drainage improvements (part B), and\n(ii) solid waste management (part C). Canal improvements (part E) will require the relocation of\ninformal dwellers from government-owned lands (canals); for the purpose of this appendix, this\nwill be classified as \u201cland acquisition\u201d.\n\nA.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n2.\nResettlement will be the responsibility of the Irrigation and Waterways Department (IWD)\nof  the  government  of  West  Bengal  and  the  Calcutta  Municipal  Corporation  (CMC).  Each\norganization will have a project management unit, which will contain personnel with community\ndevelopment  skills  for  managing  the  resettlement  operations.  Nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs), engaged under the loan, will facilitate implementation of the resettlement plan, and will\nserve  as  the  link  to  the  affected  people.  The  NGOs  will  involve  the  affected  people  in  all\ndecision-making  regarding  relocation  and  resettlement  criteria,  facilitate  formation  of  livelihood\ngroups,  encourage  the  formation  of  community-based  organizations,  and  ensure  that  affected\npeople  are  assisted  according  to  agreed  entitlements.  No  Calcutta  NGOs  have  resettlement\nexperience;  however,  some  Calcutta  NGOs  have  demonstrated  experience  and  skill  in\nimplementing  community  development  programs  and  would  be  suitable  for  this  activity.  At  the\ncommunity level, community resettlement groups will be established. These will be broad-based\ngroups  to  provide  representation  for  all  affected  people.  At  least  50  percent  of  committee\nmembers will be women.\n\nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n1.\n\nSewerage and Drainage Improvements (Part B)\n\n3.\nThe  land  required  for  development  works  under  this  component  is  not  large,  i.e.,  15\nhectares  (ha)  for  the  sewage  treatment  plant,  and  0.25-4.0  ha  for  each  of  the  nine  pumping\nstations.  Two  possible  locations  for  the  sewage  treatment  plant  have  been  identified,  one  of\nwhich is in the jurisdiction of the Rajpur Sonarpur Municipality (RSM). Although the municipality\nand  CMC  own  these  marshy  lands,  the  lands\u2019  encroachers  are  living  on  them.  About  50\nencroachers are on the CMC and about 25 are on the RSM land. When these lands are taken\nover by CMC, these encroachers will lose their livelihoods. Except for the Beerpara sewerage\npumping  station,  tracts  of  marshy  lands  belonging  to  CMC  are  being  considered  for  the\nremaining  eight  pumping  stations.  For  the  Beerpara  pumping  station,  the  possible  sites\nidentified include two public parks and one pond near a railway bridge.\n\n2.\n\nSolid Waste Management (Part C)\n\n4.\nAbout 2 ha of land will be required for the construction of garage facilities in Javadpur.\nPrivately owned land suitable for the purpose has been identified. While 80 ha of land required\nfor  the  compost  plant  is  already  available  at  Dhapa,  the  development  program  will  eventually\nclose  off  the  existing  landfill  to  trash  sorters.  Approximately  625  trash  sorters  will  lose  their\nlivelihoods. While 2.28 ha of land required for the compost plant is already available at Noapara,\nthe  Project  will  also  eventually  close  the  site  to  trash  sorters,  about  30  sorters  will  lose  their\nlivelihoods.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\n3.\n\nCanal Improvements (Part E)\n\n5.\nAbout 58 settlements are located along 34 km of canals that will be improved under the\nProject. The Project will potentially displace about 3,600 households (11,000 people) along the\ncanal  banks.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  minimize  displacement  by  reducing  the  width  of  the\ncanals,  reclaiming  of  land  from  canal  banks,  and  maneuvering  rights-of-way  to  allow  the\nhouseholds to remain in place. Where relocation is unavoidable, people will be moved to sites\nas close to their existing homes as possible, at a maximum distance of 800 meters and up to 2\nkilometers  in  some  unavoidable  cases.  By  avoiding  relocation  to  distant  sites,  affected  people\nwill be able to continue with their present employment.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements\n\n6.\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  the  1894  Land\nAcquisition Act provide the framework for resettlement. Within this framework, the resettlement\nplan provides a comprehensive package of compensation and assistance to all affected people.\nThe plan provides mitigation for (i) loss of assets, including land, house, or workplace;  (ii) loss\nof livelihood or income opportunities; and (iii) collective impacts on groups, such as the loss of\ncommunity assets and other common property resources.\n\nAffected  people  will  be  given  the  option  to  relocate  themselves  to  a  place  of  their\n7.\npreference  or  to  move  to  a  relocation  site.  Those  who  relocate  themselves  will  be  paid  an\namount equivalent to the replacement value of their existing structure. Affected people moving\nto  relocation  sites  will  be  allocated  a  plot  area  of  17  square  meters  for  households  with  5\nmembers,  and  20  square  meters  for  households  with  more  than  5  members  or  more  than  3\nadult  members.  People  who  have  no  legal  title  to  their  land  constitute  the  majority  of  affected\npersons under the Project. The housing package for canal dwellers and others with no legal title\nwill  include  (i)  a  plot  area  for  a  house,  (ii)  replacement  value  of  the  existing  structure,  less\nsalvage  value;  (iii)  assistance  for  upgrading  from  a  thatched-roof  structure  to  a  structure\ncomprising  bamboo  and  roofing  material;  and  (iv)  a  resettlement  allowance  for  a  reasonable\nperiod as will be decided by the implementation committee. The implementation committee will\ncomprise project management unit staff and canal-level community resettlement groups. CMC\nwill assist specially vulnerable households to build their houses in the relocation sites.\n\n8.\nCanal  improvement  works  will  commence  only  after  relocation  is  complete.  Affected\npeople  will  transfer  to  the  relocation  houses  only  after  their  new  houses  are  built.  Affected\npeople  will  build  their  own  houses  in  the  new  sites.  Once  the  movement  to  the  new  site  is\ncompleted, the affected people, with assistance from IWD/CMC, will demolish the old houses.\nThe affected people will be encouraged to salvage materials at the time of demolition.\n\nD. \n\nConsultations and Disclosure of Information\n\n9.\nConsultations  and  numerous  discussions  have  been  held  with  key  people  and\nstakeholders. To make the public consultations effective, participatory rapid appraisal exercises\nin the form of group meetings and discussions were conducted with groups of stakeholders. Key\npeople were identified in each locality. Most key people are actually the local ward committee,\nmunicipal,  and  village  councilors  or  members;  political  and  religious \nleaders;  youth\nrepresentatives;  schoolteachers;  or  other  eminent  people  within  the  locales.  The  key  people\nwere instrumental in discussions with affected people on the design of resettlement packages,\noptions  for  housing,  location  of  new  sites,  etc.  Separate  meetings  were  held  with  women  to\nidentify  their  specific  needs  and  concerns.  The  more  vulnerable  among  the  women  were\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nidentified  for  added  assistance.  The  women  were  also  consulted  on  site  selection,  housing\npattern,  civic  amenities,  and  livelihood  concerns.  The  Project  takes  adequate  measures  for\ndisclosure of the resettlement plan.\n\nE. \n\nGrievance Redress and Transparency\n\n10.\nThe Project will establish a grievance redress mechanism to deal with complaints from\naffected  people.  There  will  be  one  information  booth  for  each  canal-level  community\nresettlement  group.  Each  group  will  have  a  member  secretary  who  will  be  responsible  for\ndisseminating  information  and  receiving  the  summary  requirements  of  the  settlement-level\ncommunity  resettlement  group  and  stakeholder  complaints.  The  NGOs  will  ensure  that\ngrievances  are  acted  upon  in  an  effective  manner.  The  Project\u2019s  participatory  approach  to\nimplementation  will  ensure  transparency  and  accountability.    NGOs  are  expected  to  play  a\nsignificant  role  in  this  approach.    To  avoid  any  accusation  of  impropriety  and  corruption,  all\npayments relating to compensation and resettlement assistance will be made publicly.\n\nF. \n\nVulnerable Groups\n\n11.\nPeople  who  will  be  affected  by  the  Project  are  mostly  living  below  the  poverty  line.\nThere  are  2,157  households  who  are  considered  poor,  and  317  are  households  headed  by\nwomen, and 264 by elderly people.  Many children between the ages of 7 and 14 years work in\nthe  settlements.  Boys  work  mostly  in  teashops  and  small  roadside  shops  or  industries.    Girls\nmostly  work  as  domestic  helpers.  During  the  monsoon  months,  children  work  in  prawn\nprocessing centers.  When there is a short supply of prawns, children then move on to work as\ntrash sorters in landfill sites. In the Dhapa landfill site, sorters (adults and children) will lose their\nlivelihood  with  the  mechanization  of  solid  waste  management  by  the  year  2010.  The\nresettlement plan incorporates an action plan for retraining sorters at the Dhapa landfill site. In\nthe  interim  period,  sorters  will  be  provided  with  gloves,  boots,  aprons,  and  masks,  and  will  be\ngiven  periodic  health  check-ups.  With  the  closure  of  the  landfill  site,  they  will  be  assisted  to\nestablish alternative livelihoods.  An action plan for the rehabilitation of child workers from canal\nsettlements  and  landfill  sites  is  part  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Children  will  be  withdrawn  from\nemployment and assisted in getting accommodation in schools, and for those who are 7 years\nold and above, they will be trained for one year to prepare them for admission to existing formal\nschools.\n\nG. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe social development unit within CMC will be responsible for internal monitoring. The\n12.\nfocus  of  internal  monitoring  will  be  on  (i)  compensation  and  assistance  package,  (ii)\nresettlement,  (iii)  recovery,  (iv)  vulnerable  groups,  (v)  women,  (vi)  information  sharing  and\nconsultation,  (vii)  grievance  redress,  and  (viii)  budget  and  implementation  scheduling.  The\nsocial  development  unit  will  contract  out  external  monitoring  to  a  qualified  social  science\nresearch  institute,  an  NGO,  or  a  consulting  firm.  The  external  monitoring  agency  will  submit\nquarterly  reports  in  the  first  three  years  of  the  Project,  and  then  two  reports  a  year  for  the\nremaining project duration. External monitoring will verify the results of internal monitoring, and\nevaluate whether the objectives of the resettlement plan are being met.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  based  on  the  initial  environmental\n1.\nexamination (IEE) report prepared for the Project. Intensive discussions were held with the state\ngovernment, community-based organizations, and nongovernment organizations, and site visits.\nThe  Project  is  a  comprehensive  six-year  project  to  improve  environmental  quality  within  the\nCalcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area. The principal objective of the Project is to prepare\nan  urban  infrastructure  and  environmental  management  investment  to  achieve  a  sustainable\nimprovement  in  the  environment  of  Calcutta.  The  Project\u2019s  components  are:  (i)  stakeholder\nconsultation  process,  (ii)  sewerage  and  drainage  improvements,  (iii)  solid  waste  management\n(SWM),  (iv)  slums  improvements,  (v)  canal  improvements,  and  (vi)  implementation  assistance\nand  capacity  building.  The  Project  will  improve  wastewater  and  storm  drainage  management,\nand  SWM  systems  to  address  solid  waste  including  biomedical  and  hazardous  wastes.  The\nProject will improve living conditions for slum dwellers and increase the efficiency of the system\nof canals that carries surface and wastewater away from Calcutta.\n\nB. \n\nSummary Environmental Improvements due to Project Interventions\n\nThe  construction  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  will  reduce  the  load  of  heavy  metals,\n2.\norganic  chemicals,  and  other  potential  contaminants  in  the  city\u2019s  wastewater  discharges.\nReducing  the  volume  of  these  contaminants  will  improve  the  quality  of  wastewater  flows\ncurrently  being  discharged  to  the  Ganges  or  Kulti  rivers  through  the  system  of  channels  and\ncanals, and will reduce the potential for health impacts as wastewater effluents are widely used\nto irrigate crops and to support fish farms. Rehabilitating the channels and canals in Calcutta will\nreduce the potential for flooding in the city and will enhance the quality of life of people in areas\nsubject to inundation.\n\n3.\nEnhanced  SWM  will  improve  garbage  collection  and  upgrade  current  management\npractices.  This  will  reduce  the  health  impacts  caused  by  unsanitary  SWM  practices  and  help\nreduce  problems  caused  by  disease  vectors.  An  increased  program  of  separating  waste  at\nsource,  recovering  recyclable  materials,  and  improving  landfill  operations  will  reduce  the\ncontamination of surface and groundwater flowing into the East Calcutta Wetlands. Expanding\nthe  program  of  managing  biomedical  and  hazardous  wastes  will  help  protect  the  public  from\npotentially  infectious  or  injurious  wastes  that  are  improperly  managed.  Enhanced  hazardous\nwaste  management  will  help  address  current  problems  caused  by  the  discharge  of  heavy\nmetals,  solvents,  organic  chemicals,  and  other  contaminants  into  the  sewers  and  wastewater\nchannels  as  well  as  the  solid  waste.  The  program  of  slum  enhancement  will  increase  the\navailability of potable water supplies and sewer systems. This will increase the quality of life of\nthe slum residents, especially women and children, and help protect public health.\n\n4.\nThe  proposed  Project  will  result  in  a  cumulative  improvement  of  environmental\nconditions and social well being in the Calcutta area. Advances in sewerage and drainage will\nupgrade  the  overall  quality  of  life.  Individuals  residing  in  slums  will  benefit  from  the  supply  of\npotable water and the removal of domestic waste. Enhanced management of solid, biomedical,\nand hazardous wastes will help protect public health and minimize potential problems from the\nuncontrolled release of contaminants. The Project will help protect the East Calcutta Wetlands\nand the livelihoods of the individuals who depend on the food produced there.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n5.\nCalcutta  is  within  the  lower  tidal  reaches  of  the  Ganges  River.  The  area  is  mostly  flat,\nsloping in general from north to south, containing numerous low-lying areas, marshes, wetlands,\nand  shallow  lakes.  The  city  is  highly  urbanized  and  the  land-use  pattern  reflects  the  relatively\nflat landscape and the historical sequence of development. The area is seismically stable. The\nclimate is hot and humid and temperatures in Calcutta remain high throughout the year.\n\nThe  CMC  jurisdiction  receives  80  percent  of  its  water  from  surface  sources  and  20\n6.\npercent from groundwater. The majority of the surface water is extracted from the Ganges River\nat  Palta,  approximately  25  kilometers  upstream  of  the  city,  where  it  is  treated  prior  to\ndistribution. The principal productive aquifer generally occurs between 50 and 180 meters (m)\nbelow  the  ground  level,  while  a  shallow  aquifer,  tapped  by  small  diameter  tubewells,  occurs\nbetween 20 and 40 m below the ground level. The receiving waters in Calcutta that have been\nclassified  are  all  in  Class  E:  \u201cIrrigation,  industrial  cooling,  and  controlled  waste  disposal.\u201d\nThroughout the Ganges River Basin a huge quantity of water is drawn from the river and returns\nas  wastewater  without  treatment.  Domestic  and  industrial  pollution,  along  with  run-off  from\nareas that drain to the river, has led to deterioration in the quality of water in the river.\n\n7.\nIn  the  CMC  area,  the  development  of  sanitary  sewers  and  combined  sewers  to  collect\nand transport wastewater and urban runoff away from the city was initiated in 1885. However,\nsewers  serve  only  45  to  50  percent  of  the  city.  In  the  project  areas,  only  17  percent  of  the\nhouseholds are connected to sewers, while 68 percent use septic tanks and 10 percent use pit\nlatrines. While the existing sewers are adequate in certain areas during dry weather conditions,\nthey are a problem in wet weather due to inadequate channel capacity. About 80 percent of the\nsewer capacity is blocked with silt and sediment. Encroachment of residences and businesses\nalong  the  banks  of  the  channels,  improperly  sized  culverts  and  causeways,  and  siltation  has\nreduced the capacity of the canals by approximately 50 percent. As a result, approximately 55\npercent of CMC residents suffer from frequent water logging after heavy rains.\n\n8.\nLess than 49 percent of the municipal solid waste is currently collected. Only about 20\npercent  of  the  collected  waste  stream  is  recycled.  It  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  type  and\namount  of  hazardous  wastes  being  generated  in  the  CMC  area.  Approximately  15  tonnes  per\nday of biomedical waste is generated in the CMC area; the collected waste is transported to a\ndisposal facility at Dhapa. Approximately one third of the CMC population of 5.0 million live in\nbustees  (slum  areas),  with  substandard  housing  and  lack  or  have  restricted  access  to  basic\nurban environmental infrastructure.\n\n9.\nThe  project  area  is  highly  urbanized.  The  development  of  the  canal  drainage  system,\ncombined  with  the  development  of  roads  and  buildings  has  resulted  in  loss  of  much  of  native\nflora  and  fauna.  The  only  significant  ecological  and  natural  resource  are  East  Calcutta\nWetlands, an area of 6,000 hectares, the largest remaining open space in the city and part of\nthe largest wetland areas in South Asia. Calcutta contains significant cultural resource. Calcutta\nhas a number of artificial lakes within its municipal borders; these provide habitat for a number\nof  aquatic  and  avian  species  and  accommodate  recreation  activities.  Urban  development  has\nadversely  affected  the  environment  of  all  urban  lakes.  Archaeological  monuments  of  north\nCalcutta  reflect  the  traditional  culture,  and  the  structures  of  central  Calcutta  reflect  the  British\ncolonial  style  and  are  50  to  100  years  old.  Valuable  monuments  are  maintained  by  the\nDepartment of Archaeology or by private concerns.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\na.\n\nImpacts Due to Project Location\n\n10. Where  the  proposed  improvements,  such  as  the  wastewater  treatment  plants,  are\nconstructed,  some  people  may  have  to  be  relocated.  In  addition,  permanent  relocation  will  be\nrequired to maintain the drainage channels and correct the problems caused by sedimentation\nand  improperly  sized  culverts.  Temporary  disruptions  could  occur  in  communities  where\nimprovements such as sewers will be installed.\n\n11.\nSurveys  of  all  residences  and  businesses  that  could  be  disrupted  as  a  result  of  the\nproposed  improvements  will  be  completed  before  final  decisions  are  made  as  to  the  exact\nlocations  for  new  facilities  or  for  the  enhancement  of  existing  facilities.  These  surveys  will\nidentify where permanent relocation could be required as opposed to the need for mitigation to\naddress temporary disruption. For example, enhancing the capacity of the canals could require\nthat the residents and businesses located along the banks be permanently moved to protect the\ndesign capacity of the channels. On the other hand, installing sewers in city streets could only\nresult in temporary inconvenience to the local residents. Where required, the proposed Project\nwill provide for resettlement consistent with ADB policy.\n\nb.\n\nImpacts of Construction\n\n12.\nIssues  that  need  special  attention  of  the  project  management  during  the  construction\nstage include excavation, trenching and tunneling, vehicle and equipment operation, silt runoff\nduring  construction,  safety  factors,  health  factors,  nuisance  factors,  cultural  hazards,  and\nhazardous materials.\n\nc.\n\nImpacts of Operation of Enhanced/Newly Provided Environmental Services\n\n13.\nSome of the adverse environmental impacts of the proposed Project could include failure\nof  pumping  stations;  overflow/bypassing  hazards;  illegal  industrial  discharges;  solid  waste;\nsludge  treatment  and  disposal;  and  accidental  spills  of  municipal,  hazardous,  and  biomedical\nwaste  during  transportation,  However,  standard  engineering  design,  equipment,  and  practices\nshould  mitigate  these  potential  problems.  Both  hazardous  and  biomedical  facilities  will  have\nsecure  treatment  and  storage  capacities.  Incinerators  should  have  adequate  emission  control\nprovisions and as a minimum comprise of (i) a ventury scrubber to lower gas temperatures for\nsubsequent  treatment;  (ii)  a  packed  tower  scrubber  utilizing  sodium  hydroxide  solution\nmaintained at pH 10 by auto-dosing; and (iii) an insulated stainless glass stack terminating not\nless than 30 m above the ground.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring System\n\n14.\nThe  existing  institutional  framework  adequately  responds  to  the  goals  and  the  tasks  of\nthe Project. The West Bengal pollution control board is responsible for environmental monitoring\nand  enhancement  of  environmental  standards  in  the  CMC  area.  In  addition,  project\nmanagement  consultants  will  assist  CMC  in  developing  a  monitoring  plan  to  address  the\nenvironmental  monitoring  requirements  presented  in  this  summary  initial  environmental\nexamination.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  each  executing  agency  to  ensure  that  all  permits  and\nlicenses  are  obtained  from  the  necessary  environmental  control  authorities  for  all  project\ncomponents.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n15.\nThe  findings  of  IEE  suggest  that  the  proposed  Project  has  a  low  level  of  adverse\nenvironmental concern, and will greatly improve the overall environmental situation in Calcutta.\nThe  potential  adverse  impacts  are  assessed  as  moderately  insignificant  assuming  that  certain\nmitigation measures will be carried out including:\n\n(i) \n\ndevelopment and implementation of resettlement/relocation plans;\n\n(ii) \n\nthe program for control and handling of biomedical and hazardous waste;\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nappropriate  siting  of  solid  waste  disposal  sites,  treatment  plants,  sewerage\nworks, and other project facilities;\n\ntreatment  of  sewage  to  appropriate  standards  to  protect  receiving  waters  and\ncommunity health;\n\nconstruction of sewers and drains by trenchless methods, so far as practicable,\nto mitigate traffic congestion caused by sewer construction;\n\nproper  operation  and  maintenance  in  maintaining  a  consistently  high  quality  of\nnewly provided/improved services; and\n\nadequate training for operating personnel, close supervision and process quality\ncontrol,  and  vigorous  monitoring  of  unit  operations  and  processes,  to  ensure\nsystems effectiveness.\n\n16.\nHowever,  it  is  considered  good  practice  to  undertake  an  environmental  impact\nassessment for all treatment plants, sewage pumping stations and solid waste facilities, as soon\nas the land is identified and the detailed design is substantially developed.\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\n17.\nThe proposed Project will not cause significant environmental problems resulting from its\nplanning  design,  construction,  or  operation.  The  Project  will  provide  valuable  environmental\nbenefits to the Calcutta area. The need to improve urban infrastructure in the area is urgent, and\nthe  Project  will  provide  this  in  an  efficient  and  environmentally  reasonable  way.  However,\nenvironmental  impact  assessments  should  be  undertaken  for  all  treatment  plants,  sewage\npumping stations and waste facilities, as soon as the land is identified and the detailed design is\nsubstantially developed.\n\n\f60\n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nA. \n\nClientele Profile\n\nThrough improving the environment, the Project\u2019s components are expected to improve\n1.\nthe  human  capital  and  economic  growth  of  the  target  area  and,  in  particular,  reduce  poverty\nthrough  mainstreaming  the  poorer  groups.  The  profile  of  the  clientele  groups  is  based  on  the\nanalysis  of  detailed  socioeconomic  surveys  and  intensive  consultations  with  the  affected\ncommunities.\n\n2.\nThe  Calcutta  metropolitan  area  is  one  of  the  largest  urban  centers  in  India,  and  is\nurbanizing at a rate of about 2.5-3.0 percent/annum. The Calcutta municipal area, on the other\nhand, has a very high population density, and does not experience the same growth. Between\n1950  and  1970,  the  Calcutta  municipal  area  grew  by  about  20-30  percent  each  decade,  with\nmuch of the growth occurring over very short periods, caused by geopolitical events or natural\ndisasters.  Since  the  1970s  however,  the  rate  of  population  growth  has  declined  considerably.\nBetween 1971 and 1981, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) recorded an annual growth\nrate of less than one half percent, and between 1981 and 1991 the total growth for the decade\nwas registered at a little over 6 percent. The 1991 census recorded a population for the Calcutta\nmunicipal  area  of  4.38  million,  with  a  heavy  concentration  in  the  inner  wards;  the  inner  wards\nare thought to have densities up to four times what an urban area can support on a sustainable\nbasis; this figure is now expected to be around 5.0 million. Thus, people in these areas are likely\nto  move  to  the  outer  areas,  with  a  consequent  readjustment  of  the  population  densities.  The\nouter areas, which comprise the project area for most of the components, currently have a total\npopulation of around 1.4 million, with densities ranging from 7,000 to 29,000 people per square\nkilometer. Based on land use maps and recent growth trends, the population in the outer areas\nis expected to grow to around 1.47 million by 2011, and 1.52 million by 2021.\n\nFor  classification  purposes,  the  term  \u201cslum\u201d  is  used  in  this  document  to  refer  to  low-\n3.\nincome settlements of high population density that lack adequate public services and amenities.\nAround  50  percent  of  the  target  population  live  in  slum  housing  or  worse.  A  slum  dwelling  is\ntypically a single roomed, single story, dwelling constructed of nonpermanent building materials.\nAbout  700,000  people  live  in  such  houses.  About  26-30  percent  of  the  slum  dwelling\nhouseholds  in  the  target  area  live  below  the  poverty  line\u2014  about  180,000-210,000  people,  or\n13-15  percent  of  the  total  population  in  the  project  area.1  Low-income  or  slum  settlements\ncomprise registered bustees,2 refugee colonies, unregistered settlements (unregistered bustees\nand canal bank settlements), and pavement dwellers. These settlements represent 29 percent,\n11 percent, and 10 percent of the target population, respectively. The CMC Act, 1980, and the\nThika Tenancy Act aim to mainstream the poor into society through providing them with security\nof tenure and basic services. Under a series of refugee rehabilitation schemes, the Government\nof West Bengal is progressively recognizing refugee colonies (62 colonies recognized to date)\nby providing them with land titles and basic amenities. Unregistered settlements and pavement\ndwellers have no legal recognition by CMC and are, thus, not entitled to any security of tenure\nor basic services.\n\n                                                \n1  The \u201cpoverty line\u201d in India is defined as income necessary to buy food to meet a daily intake of 2,400 calories of\nenergy  in  rural  areas  (2,100  calories  in  urban  areas),  and  certain  basic  nonfood  items  such  as  clothing  and\ntransportation. In monetary terms, this is about Rs300 ($6.50) for urban areas.\n\n2 A bustee is a settlement of primarily low-income people.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nOver 80 percent of the population in the Calcutta municipal area are Hindu, 14 percent\n4.\nare Muslim, and several other minority groups make up the balance. Muslims make up a larger\npercentage of slum-dwelling populations (20 percent) than in other areas (10 percent).\n\nB. \n\nClientele Needs\n\n5.\nUrban population pressure is giving rise to serious concerns about environmental health\nin Calcutta, particularly among the poor and disadvantaged groups. In the target area, only 17\npercent of the target population have a sewerage connection, less than 50 percent of the area is\ncovered by a drainage system, and only 70 percent of the area is served by solid waste collection.\nAlthough  infrastructure  deficiencies  impact  on  all  sections  of  society,  they  particularly  affect  the\nurban  poor\u2014more  than  90  percent  share  toilet  facilities.  Drainage  systems  are  aging  and\ninadequate,  which  gives  rise  to  frequent  flooding  and  environmental  contamination  of  low-lying\nresidential  areas.  Industrial  wastes  flow,  largely  untreated,  into  the  surrounding  environment,\nexposing  the  community  to  acids,  toxic  chemicals,  paints  and  varnish,  and  other  highly  toxic\ncompounds. Smoke from the burning of dung, woodfuel, coal and kerosene inside slum dwellings\npredisposes  occupants,  especially  young  children  and  women,  to  acute  respiratory  infections\n(ARIs).  Some  77  percent  of  the  survey  sample  reported  having  no  separate  and  dedicated\ncooking area. Degradation of the environment is leading to increasing concern about morbidity\nand  mortality  rates.  Although  CMC\u2019s  database  on  public  health  is  very  limited,  it  shows  that\nmortality rates due to ARI and diarrhea account for around 29 percent of all infant deaths.3\n\n6.\nInadequate shelter is also aggravating health conditions in the slum areas. Of the total\nslum  population,  around  70  percent  of  the  target  population  occupy  a  single  room,\nnonpermanent structure, and around 80 percent occupy dwellings of 36 square meters or less.\nThe population density typical of slum settlements remains a major public health concern with\nregard  to  the  transmission  of  communicable  diseases,  especially  tuberculosis.  In  addition,  the\nlimited  ventilation  in  single  room  dwellings  exposes  all  family  members  to  the  hazards  of\ncooking smoke.\n\nC. \n\nClientele Demands and Willingness to Pay\n\nThe  socioeconomic  survey  revealed  a  strong  demand  among  the  Project\u2019s  target\n7.\npopulation for improved water supply, and sewerage and drainage systems, ranging from 66 to\n100 percent. The demand was strongest among the poorer groups, indicating the high resource\ncosts  they  perceive  under  existing  circumstances.  Over  90  percent  of  the  respondents  in\nstandard residential dwellings, and almost 95 percent of respondents in registered bustees are\nwilling to pay up to Rs50 ($1.10) per month for improved services. Demand for improved solid\nwaste collection was much lower, indicating a lack of awareness of its linkages with improved\nhygiene  and  sanitation.  Only  5-24  percent  of  the  sample  expressed  a  willingness  to  pay  for\nimproved  collection.  This  will  need  to  be  addressed  through  the  proposed  stakeholder\nconsultation process (SCP) to raise awareness and willingness to pay.\n\nD. \n\nAffordability to Pay\n\n8.\nBased  on  the  universally  adopted  guideline  that  the  total  cost  of  water  supply  and\nsanitation  services  should  not  exceed  of  5  percent  of  monthly  household  income,  affordability\nlevels  have  been  examined.  Water  tariffs  will  be  increased  over  the  next  few  years,  but  the\nexact  level  is  not  yet  known.  However,  based  on  the  general  experience  of  the  Asian\n\n                                                \n3 Based on a pilot area program\u2014Calcutta Slum Improvement Project.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB), water supply and sanitation are each likely to represent about 50\npercent of the total. Therefore, sanitation should not exceed 2.5 percent of monthly household\nincome.  Based  on  this  premise,  two  representative  income  levels  are  considered  in  the\naffordability  analysis.  The  first  is  the  median  household  income  level  of  Rs3,700/month\n($80/month)  in  1999,  and  the  second  is  the  income  level  below  which  community  water\nstandpipes and latrines are the affordable and appropriate option\u2014Rs2,670/month ($58/month)\nand below in 1999.\n\nIndirect  recovery  of  costs  for  the  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  operations  is\n9.\nproposed through the consolidated rate charge system, as is currently applied. The amount of\nconsolidated  rate  charge  to  be  paid  by  the  individual  will  be  proportional  to  the  value  of  the\nproperty. Properties owned by low-income families will be assessed at an appropriately low and\ntax)  will  be\naffordable \ncomprehensively addressed under the capacity building component of the Project.\n\nrate.  Evaluation  of \n\nthe  consolidated \n\nrate  charge \n\n(property \n\n10.\nCosts of sewerage and drainage will be partly recovered through the consolidated rate\ncharge  and  partly  through  a  direct  user  charge.  As  with  SWM,  the  affordability  of  the  indirect\ncharge  will  be  considered  in  detail  as  part  of  the  capacity  building  component.  The  monthly\ndirect  user  charge  is  projected  for  the  years  FY2002  (year  of  introduction),  FY2006,  and\nFY2016,  and  expressed  as  a  ratio  of  the  projected  median  and  lower  bound  income,\nrespectively.  In  FY2002,  the  user  charge  will  represent  1.1  percent  and  1.6  percent  of  such\nincomes; in FY2006, it will represent 1.3 and 1.8 percent; and in 2016, it will represent 1.2 and\n1.6 percent. All of these ratios are substantially below the affordability limit of 2.5 percent.\n\nE. \n\nBenefits of the Project\n\n11.\nThe Project will improve the urban environment and enhance human capital, which will\nlead to improved health and increased productivity, particularly among the slum dwellers. In the\nlonger  term,  improved  health  will,  in  turn,  contribute  to  better  educational  standards  and\neconomic  growth.  The  SCP  will  underpin  the  sustainability  of  the  Project  through  improved\nrepresentation.  In  addition,  the  SCP  will  empower  communities,  enabling  them  to  participate\nmore  actively  and  constructively  on  all  civic  matters.  Around  1.4-5.0  million  people  will  benefit\nfrom the Project, of which some 50 percent reside in slum settlements.\n\n12.\nAccessibility by the poor and underprivileged to basic services and improved shelter in\nthe  slum  settlements  will  assist  in  mainstreaming  them  into  society.  This  will  alleviate  their\npersonal burden and provide considerable benefit to the people of Calcutta as a whole. About\n190,000  slum  dwellers  will  benefit  from  direct  slum  intervention  under  the  Project.  Many  more\nwill benefit indirectly from improved municipal services, and improved employment opportunities\ngenerated by the considerable labor requirement for the construction work.\n\nF. \n\nGender Issues\n\n13.\nAlthough  the  Project  is  not  specifically  targeted  at  women,  all  components  will  help\nimprove their quality of life. Women, as \u201ccaretakers\u201d of the home environment, are affected by\npoor  living  conditions,  particularly  poor  sanitation  standards.  In  addition,  their  exposure  to\ncooking  smoke  increases  the  risk  of  acute  respiratory  infection  substantially.  Improved\nenvironmental  sanitation  and  the  replacement  of  traditional  internal  cooking  fires  will  enhance\ntheir quality of life.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nG. \n\nPotential Adverse Impacts\n\n14.\nLand  for  sewage  treatment  plants  and  pump  stations  can  not  be  located  exactly  until\ndetailed  engineering  analysis  has  taken  place,  as  part  of  the  project  implementation.  Any\nresettlement  required  at  that  time  will  be  handled  under  a  resettlement  framework  that  is  in\naccordance with ADB's Resettlement Policy. This will be used to prepare a detailed resettlement\nplan prior to land acquisition, and will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval.\n\nCMC\u2019s  sewerage  and  drainage  system  discharges  into  a  network  of  large  canals  or\n15.\noutfalls, which convey the combined effluent and stormwater to the Ganges River system. The\ncanals are state property, maintained by the Irrigation and Waterways Department. Over many\nyears,  people  have  illegally  established  settlements  along  the  banks  of  the  canals.  These\nsettlements interfere with the flow of the canals, accelerating the natural siltation process of the\ncanals  and  causing  a  severe  environmental  health  hazard.  The  resulting  loss  of  hydraulic\ncapacity  requires  more  frequent  maintenance  of  the  canals,  the  budget  for  which  is  already\ninadequate. Consequently, the flooding and environmental hazards are becoming more frequent\nand  more  severe.4  To  dredge  the  canals  and  maintain  permanent  access  for  future\nmaintenance, the canal bank dwellers must be relocated.\n\n16.\nThe  potentially  affected  persons  along  the  canal  banks  have  been  surveyed  and\nregistered.  All  efforts  were  made  to  seek  engineering  solutions  to  minimize  resettlement.  The\nfirst priority was to minimize resettlement impacts on shopkeepers whose incomes are location-\nspecific.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary\nResettlement Policy (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement, A Guide to Good Practice (1998).\nA  resettlement  framework  has  also  been  prepared  to  guide  CMC  in  the  preparation  of  any\nfurther  resettlement plans required under the Project.\n\nH. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe  project \n\nframework  provides \n\n17.\nindicators  by  project\ncomponent. A detailed benefit and monitoring evaluation plan, including impact evaluation and\nidentification  of  positive  changes  in  the  urban  environment,  such  as  improved  health  and\nnumber  and  type  of  beneficiaries  covered  by  new  utilities  and  services,  has  been  prepared.\nSpecific social monitoring is further described under the SCP and the resettlement plans.\n\nthe  Project's  monitoring \n\n                                                \n4  Loans were taken out by the government of West Bengal to dredge and desilt the canals in the early 1970s and in\n\nthe early 1990s; they now need further rehabilitation.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nA.\n \nThe  analytical  framework  for  determining  whether  resources  are  being  used  in  an\n1.\nefficient  and  sustainable  manner  is  based  on  the  following  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)\npublications: Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997)  and Framework for the\nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects (1994). A summary of\nthe methodology and assumptions used, a description of the economic costs and benefits, and\nthe result of the analysis follow.\n\n2.\nAn integral economic analysis has been made for the Project as a whole since the main\neconomic benefits of all components are all related with an improvement in the health situation\nof  the  population  of  Calcutta  through  improvements  in  the  sewerage,  drainage,  and  canals\nsystems of the city and the management of solid waste. The slum improvement component has\nalso  been  included  in  the  elaboration  of  the  integrated  economic  analysis.  The  sewerage,\ndrainage,  and  canals  components  will  benefit  approximately  1.4  million  people  in  the  outer\nareas of Calcutta (incremental population of 1.0 million). The solid waste management (SWM)\ncomponent will benefit the whole of the Calcutta municipality with an estimated population of 5.0\nmillion, and the slum improvement component will benefit 190,000 people. The capital costs and\nincremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  all  components,  except  part  A\n(stakeholder consultation process), have been considered. Per capita values for each economic\nbenefit have been calculated and multiplied by the benefited population.\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Costs and Benefits\n\n3.\nThe  analysis  derived  economic  costs  from  the  financial  project  costs.  All  cost  are\nexpressed in constant (2000) prices.  Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been added to\nthe  base  costs,  and  taxes  and  duties  have  been  discounted  at  the  level  of  15  percent  for\nequipment and vehicles, 6 percent for civil works and 5 percent for O&M and implementation.\nEconomic  costs  were  valued  using  domestic  currency  and  the  domestic  price  numeraire.\nTradable  items  were  assigned  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.11,  the  reciprocal  of  the\nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.9.  A  shadow  wage  rate  of  0.7  for  unskilled  labor  in  India  has\nbeen  used  to  reflect  its  opportunity  costs  in  the  context  of  wide  availability.  An  allowance  has\nbeen  made  for  replacement  investment  over  the  assumed  30  year  life  of  the  Project.\nIncremental O&M costs were taken into account and added to capital costs to obtain the total\neconomic cost of the Project for each year.\n\n4.\nThe  main  economic  benefit  of  all  the  components  of  the  Project  is  improved  human\nhealth. There will also be cost savings due to the different activities of the Project. The method\nused  to calculate  the  health benefits due the project is to multiply disability-adjusted life years\n(DALYs) data by the median per capita income. DALYs are derived by estimating the value of\nlife-years lost because of disability\u2014using a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death). In 1992\nan estimated 171 DALYs per thousand urban population were lost in West Bengal.1 While the\nWest Bengal data disagregates DALY by disease group, it does not disagregate by major risk\nfactor. The Global Burden of Disease study2 assessed the burden attributable to 10 major risk\nfactors.  The  researchers  concluded  that  9.5  percent  of  DALY  losses  are  attributable  to  poor\n                                                          \n1  Government of West Bengal. 1999.

The Global Burden of Disease.  A  comprehensive  assessment  of\n\nmortality and disability from diseases, injuries and risks factors in 1990 and projected to 2020.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nwater  and  sanitation  in  India.  For  this  economic  analysis,  DALY  losses  attributable  to  poor\nsewerage and drainage are assumed at 5 percent and the losses attributable to poor SWM at 3\npercent of DALY losses. Additionally, for the slum improvement component, the loss attributable\nto poor housing is assumed to be 1 percent of DALY losses. The median household income at\n1999  prices  is  Rs66,600  ($1,517)  yearly.  This  means  that  the  average  loss  per  capita  due  to\nillness  is  Rs1,881  ($43.2).3  Hence,  the  per  capita  loss  due  to  poor  sewerage  and  drainage  is\nRs118.3 ($2.7) yearly, while the average loss per capita due to poor SWM is Rs56.5 ($1.3) and\ndue to poor housing is also Rs18.8 ($0.4). The economic value of health benefits will increase in\nline  with  the  increase  in  state  domestic  product  (SDP)  per  capita.  The  value  of  a  DALY  loss\nrelates directly to the value of per capita output. The SDP of West Bengal is likely to grow at an\nannual  rate  of  6.7  percent.  The  analysis  has  assumed  that  the  per  capita  value  of  health\nbenefits increases at an annual rate of 6 percent.\n\n5.\nOther  benefits  from  the  Project  include  benefits  from  the  recycled  and  compostable\nmaterials, the market value of which is initially considered to be Rs6.3 million ($144,828), rising\nevery 5 years; reduced cost of hospital and health services, equivalent to 5, 3, and 1 percent of\nthe  Rs7,768  million  ($178.6  million)  spent  annually  on  hospital  and  health  services  by  the\nCalcutta  Municipal  Corporation  (CMC);  reduced  household  expenditure  on  medical  expenses,\nrepresenting about 1.9 percent of household expenditure in the CMC area; reduced expenditure\non  cleaning  and  maintenance  of  septic  tanks,  considering  the  average  annual  price  per\nhousehold for cleaning and rent of septic tank is Rs350 ($8.0); reduced costs of removing solid\nwaste  that  people  dump  in  canals,  representing  Rs28.5million  ($0.7  million)  yearly;  reduced\ncosts for repairing road and vehicle damage from flooding, assumed to be 20 percent of CMC\nexpenditure  on  road  maintenance  plus  an  additional  50  percent  of  that  amount  for  vehicles;\nreduced expenditure on repair of dwellings related to waterlogging, assumed that 5 percent of\nthe total households expenditure on repairs is related to flooding; reduced travel delays due to\nwaterlogging, with the average number of days lost due to flooding is assumed to be 2.5.\n\nThe analysis does not include some important benefits that are difficult to value or might\n6.\nincur double counting under some circumstances. These nonvalued benefits include increases\nin land values, reduction of flood impacts on economic activities, benefits that accrue to people\nresident outside the CMC area (e.g., benefits to nonresidents who work in Calcutta and benefits\nto visitors), and the emotional benefits of reductions in morbidity and mortality.\n\n2.\n\nResults of the Economic Analysis\n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is used as the measure to identify the extent\n7.\nto which the Project is economically viable. The EIRR obtained for the Project is 14.5 percent,\nwhich is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis demonstrates the consequences of changes in the values of cost\n8.\nand benefits or delays in benefits for 1 or 2 years on the economic viability of the Project, and a\ncombination of both. The results of the analysis show that the EIRR is most sensitive to delays\nin benefits. Additional sensitivity analysis has been made to test the EIRR, when the number of\npeople benefited by the Project is reduced by 10 percent. For all scenarios, the EIRR remains\nrobust. Switching values have been calculated to test how much the benefits could be reduced\nand how much costs could increase before the EIRR reaches 12 percent. The results show a\nswitching  value  of  18  percent  in  the  case  of  cost  increases  and  15  percent  in  the  case  of\n\n                                                          \n3  The figure is obtained as the result of multiplying 171 disability years by the median per capita household income\n\ndivided by the average number of persons in a household and divided by 1,000.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nbenefits  reduction.  Hence,  while  every  effort  has  been  made  to  measure  the  benefits,  some\nhave  not  been  quantified  due  to  measurement  difficulties  and  the  difficulties  associated  with\ntracing all the economic impacts.\n\nB.\n\nFinancial Position of the Government of West Bengal\n\n9.\nThe government of West Bengal will provide financing to contribute to part B (sewerage\nand  drainage),  part  E  (canal  improvements)  and  part  F  (incremental  administration  for  the\nIrrigation  and  Waterways  Department  [IWD]).  The  proposed  funding  of  about  $55  million\nequivalent  (about  Rs2,550  million)  is  to  be  provided  by  the  state  government  over  a  six-year\nperiod.  This  would  represent  around  2.0  percent  of  annual  current  revenues  as  budgeted  for\nFY2001.\n\n10.\nThe  state  government  is  conscious  of  the  increasing  difficulty  in  the  state\u2019s  public\nfinances and is encouraging broader-based reforms to tackle the issue. In particular, enhancing\nefforts to improve the efficiency of the tax and non-tax systems to mobilize additional revenues,\nand  reducing  unnecessary  government  expenditures  and  efficient  decentralization  of\nadministration are being considered. The contemplated improvement in fiscal management will\nfurther  facilitate  provision  of  the  counterpart  funding,  which  in  any  case,  amounts  to  only  one\npercent  of  the  state\u2019s  annual  current  revenue.  Given  the  high  priority  accorded  to  the  Project,\nthe  state  government  confirmed  that,  despite  the  present  difficult  fiscal  situation,  counterpart\nfunding will be provided on a timely basis during implementation of the project.\n\nC.\n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis of CMC\n\n11.\nFinancial  analysis  and  financial  rates  of  return  were  determined  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector\nProjects.  Financial  analyses  were  conducted  for  the  urban  drainage  and  sewerage  and  the\nSWM components, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Analysis of Projects.\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Practices and Position of CMC\n\n12. While  CMC  follows  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  because  CMC  lacks\ncomputerized  accounting  systems,  it  must  rely  on  cash-based  accounting  information  rather\nthan accrual accounting procedures. The delayed preparation and audit of accounts means that\nproper financial information is not available on a timely basis. Although the general ledger and\ntrial balance (cash) are computerized, with all receipts and payments computerized, most other\naccounting functions are done manually. Under the CMC 1980, the accounts of the corporation\nare  to  be  audited  by  the  state  government  or  by  auditors  appointed  on  their  behalf.  However,\nthere is no time limit on preparing financial accounts by the CMC and completing the audit. The\naudit of the accounts by an international auditor for FY1991 year ended 31 March 1991 has just\nbeen completed. At the same time the CMC provides to the examiner of local accounts, West\nBengal, unaudited copies of its income statement (cash basis) within 12 months of the end of\nthe financial year. Given the lack of up-to-date financial data it has been necessary to rely on\nthe CMC annual budgetary statements of receipts and expenses (both capital and operational)\nwhen reviewing CMC\u2019s past financial performance.\n\n13.\nCMC\u2019s financial performance for the last three years shows that for FY1997 (year ended\n31 March 1997), FY1998, and FY1999, CMC achieved a cash surplus on its operations. From\nFY1997  to  FY1999  revenues  generated  by  CMC  in  Calcutta  have  amounted  to  around  60\npercent  of  total  receipts  and  are  estimated  to  be  51  percent  in  FY2000.  Of  the  amount\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\ngenerated  by  CMC,  the  consolidated  rate  charge  has  been  the  major  source,  representing\napproximately  60  percent  of  revenues  over  this  period.  User  fees  for  water,  sewerage,  and\nSWM  represented  only  5  percent  of  the  revenues  in  FY1999.    The  balance  of  revenue\ngenerated  by  CMC  relates  to  other  taxes  and  services  provided  by  CMC  such  as  crematoria,\nslaughterhouses, car parking, etc.\n\n14.\nThe other major source of recurrent revenues is annual transfers from the state of West\nBengal to CMC. The most important transfers include cost-of-living adjustments and increased\ncost  of  pay  for  annual  incremental  increases  in  salary  and  wage  increases.  In  FY2000,  these\nare estimated at 63 percent of total entitlements. The other main entitlement is the development\ngrant, which is paid in lieu of the collection of the octroi tax on goods and services by CMC; this\nrepresented  26  percent  of  entitlements  from  the  state  government.  All  these  entitlements\nrepresented 89 percent of state transfers in FY2000. The sum of all transfers from the state to\nCMC for FY1999 represented 53 percent of all CMC receipts and is estimated at 49 percent in\nFY2000.\n\n2.\n\nAssumptions for the Financial Projections\n\n15.\nFinancial projections prepared for CMC consist of projected receipts and expenditures.\nThis  includes  receipts  generated  from  all  locally  applied  taxes,  such  as  the  consolidated  rate\ncharge; all nontax receipts, such as sewerage and drainage service charges and water tariffs;\nand  all  regular  transfers  from  the  state.  Expenditures  include  all  recurrent  and  capital\nexpenditures met from revenues. In addition, capital expenditures for the proposed Project are\nincluded in the projections, together with project funding from the state and the Government of\nIndia in the form of debt and grants to support the Project. The balance of the funding is met by\nCMC  from  improved  consolidated  rate  charge  collections,  property  tax  reform  and  the\nintroduction of user charges.\n\nThe financial projections are presented on a fiscal year basis with the fiscal year being\n16.\nthe 12-month period ending 31 March. The projections are prepared for the 12 year period from\nFY2001 to FY2012. Estimated project costs, projected revenues, and expenses are presented\nin  Rupees  and  US  dollars  and  expressed  in  current  prices  incorporating  projected  general\ninflation over the forecast period. Growth in SDP for West Bengal is estimated at 6.7 percent per\nannum.  However,  this  level  of  growth  may  not  be  sustained  over  the  12  year  forecast  period.\nTherefore,  it  is  assumed  that  revenue  and  expenses  will  increase  in  real  terms  by  half  the\ngrowth  in  SDP  as  a  central  assumption,  with  either  zero  real  growth  or  growth  at  6.7  percent\napplied in specific cases. The CMC population is estimated to be 5.0 million and is assumed to\nincrease by 0.5 percent annually, while project area population of 1.4 million is assumed to grow\nat 2.5 percent per annum through to FY2011 and then 1.5 percent thereafter.\n\nUnder  the  Project,  CMC,  in  conjunction  with  the  state,  will  implement  property  tax\n17.\nreforms that will build on recent improvements in computerization of master files and collection\nprocedures.  Over  the  shorter  term  (FY2001-2003),  collections  will  continue  increasing  at  the\nsame  level  as  in  previous  years.  Over  the  medium  term  (FY2003-2007),  the  existing  ratable\nvalue methodology is to be replaced by an area-based valuation methodology based on capital\nvalues. Property tax receipts are assumed to increase in real terms by 8-9 percent per annum to\n2006,  and  3.35  percent  per  annum  (the  midrange  growth  forecast)  thereafter.  Collection\nefficiency levels are assumed to increase from the current 60% level to 80% in FY2005.\n\n18.\nAs part of its overall reform program, CMC is to implement flat rate user charges for all\npremises with a 20 mm diameter water supply connection or larger, and progressively introduce\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\nstructured  water  tariffs  in  conjunction  with  a  metering  program.  Introduction  of  computerized\nbilling  and  accounting  systems  should  improve  collection  procedures  and  collection  efficiency\nfor the consolidated rate charge. Water tariffs are assumed to increase in nominal terms by 15\npercent every two years with increases in connections reaching 1 million people in the project\narea in FY2007. Receipts generated from the provision of sewerage and drainage services over\nthe  forecast  period  are  those  projected  under  the  Project  from  a  surcharge  equivalent  to  50\npercent  of  the  water  supply  charge.  Receipts  generated  from  the  SWM  services  over  the\nforecast period are those projected under the Project from users fees for commercial customers.\n\n19.\nThe  State  Finance  Commission  reforms  will  increase  of  the  percentage  of  collected\ntaxes  transferred  from  the  state  to  local  governments.  The  reforms  will  result  in  16  percent  of\nthe tax revenue collected by the state, net of the entertainment tax, being transferred to urban\nand local bodies. On the basis of the formula proposed by the commission, CMC\u2019s share will be\n3.8 percent. In addition the state has agreed to meet 100 percent of the cost-of-living allowance,\nand increase CMC\u2019s share of entertainment tax from 50 percent to 90 percent. Over the forecast\nperiod, the grant is assumed to increase in real terms at 1.0 percent per annum and in line with\nthe projected annual local inflation rate. The development grant transfer is received by CMC in\nlieu of  the past  octroi  tax on goods  and services imported into Calcutta municipality. Over  the\nforecast period, the grant is assumed to increase at an annual rate of 3.35 percent, expressed\nin constant prices, plus the projected local inflation rate. It is assumed that CMC contracts out\nthe management of markets and devolves some of its responsibilities for health and education\nto nongovernment organizations and the state.\n\n20.\nThe  capital  cost  of  the  Project  is  financed  in  accordance  with  the  proposed  financing\nplan under the Project. The rehabilitation of canals is undertaken by the IWD. CMC will meet the\nsewerage  connection  costs  under  the  Project  and  then  recover  these  costs  through  the\nconsolidated rate charge system over 2-3 years.\n\nSewerage  and  wastewater  services  are  regarded  as  revenue  generating,  therefore,\n21.\nthese components are financed by loans from the Government at a 13 percent interest rate and\na 25 year repayment period, with a 6 year grace period. The annual cost of debt service of the\nProject is financed according to the proposed financing plan.\n\n3.\n\nCost Recovery Mechanisms\n\na.\n\nSewerage and Drainage\n\n22.\nThe drainage and wastewater collection system is under the management of CMC. The\nwater  supply,  sewerage,  and  drainage  account  of  the  municipal  fund  accounts  for  income,\ntransfers,  and  expenditures  directly  relating  to  the  provision  of  water  supply,  sewerage,  and\ndrainage services. At present, CMC\u2019s sewerage and drainage services depend almost entirely\non  CMC\u2019s  general  revenue  sources  from  consolidated  rate  charge  allocations,  and  state\ngovernment  grants.  Since  revenue  generation  from  consolidated  rate  charges  and  other\nsources has been extremely poor, CMC has been unable to provide satisfactory sewerage and\ndrainage  services,  with  insufficient  funds  for  O&M  or  capital  investment.  Users  contribute  little\ntoward drainage and sewerage costs. User fees for sewerage and drainage services are applied\nonly to industrial, commercial, and institutional (ICI) customers.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 13, page 6\n\nThe proposed cost recovery mechanism for Calcutta\u2019s sewerage and drainage subsector\n23.\nis  the  implementation  of  a  two-part  fee  structure.  The  system  is  based  on  a  water  user\nsurcharge charge and the allocation of 15 percent of the consolidated rate charge collections to\ncover  all  recurrent  operating  costs  and  a  proportion  of  debt  service  as  well  as  future  capital\nexpenditure for sewerage and drainage. Current direct user fees are to be reviewed, new tariffs\nestablished,  property  tax  reformed  and  collection  mechanisms  improved.  The  reforms  will\nprovide for the long-term financial sustainability of the sector.\n\n Under the Project, user fees for water supply will be established for all ICI and domestic\n24.\nconsumers having a water connection, 20 mm diameter or greater. All such consumers will pay\na  flat  rate  charge.  Increases  in  tariffs  will  be  slightly  higher  than  the  inflation  rate  during  the\nimplementation  period.  As  meters  are  installed,  premises  will  pay  in  accordance  with  a\nstructured tariff.\n\n25.\nThe consolidated rate charge allocated to sewerage and drainage constitutes an indirect\ncost recovery mechanism. Consolidated rate charge collection will increase significantly due to\nthe introduction of improved systems for tax billing and collection. This will substantially increase\nthe  amounts  dedicated  to  sewerage  and  drainage  service  maintenance  and  improvement.\nDirect and indirect user fees together will be sufficient to cover all O&M costs and debt service.\n\nThe initial connection charge to the sewerage system will be about Rs6,000, depending\n26.\non the location of the house or premise. CMC is to initially shoulder this cost, and then recover it\nfrom  users  over  a  2-3  year  period.  This  financing  mechanism  will  help  to  avoid  delays  in  the\nconnections to the sewerage system.\n\n27.\nAt  present,  in  many  cases  each  water  or  sewerage  connection  serves  the  needs  of\nseveral households in a single premise. The available data shows that each water connection is\nserving approximately 10 people. Socioeconomic surveys show that each household has about\n4 people. This means that each connection is serving an average of 2.5 households. Assuming\nthe  same  ratio  of  1  water  connection  and  1  sewerage  connection  for  every  10  people,  the\nProject will expand the number of sewerage connections to reach 100,000 in order to cover 60\npercent of the total population of the project area by FY2007.\n\nb.\n\nSolid Waste\n\n28.\nCost  recovery  mechanisms  will  be  established  to  assure  long-term  sustainability.  An\nindirect  cost  recovery  mechanism  will  be  established  through  the  consolidated  rate  charge\nsystem. CMC will establish a dedicated account for SWM. An amount equivalent to 15 percent\nof  the  consolidated  rate charge  collections will be transferred to this account and will be used\nexclusively for SWM. Fees will be charged to medical facilities and industries for the collection,\ntransportation,  and  treatment  of  biomedical  and  hazardous  wastes.    Additional  revenues  will\nalso be obtained from recycling of compostable materials and charges for particular services.\n\n29.\nAt the proposed level of fees and considering the expected increase in consolidated rate\ncharge collections, CMC will be able to recover all current and incremental O&M costs and meet\nits  debt  service  after  project  completion.  Because  the  main  source  of  recovery  from  domestic\nconsumers will be the consolidated rate charge, the poorest sections of the population will not\nbe seriously affected, as they do not pay this charge.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 13, page 7\n\n4.\n\nAffordability and Willingness to Pay\n\n30.\nAn  analysis  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  households,  particularly  those  in  the  lower\nincome  groups  can  afford  the  proposed  sewerage  and  drainage  charges.  The  generally\naccepted  guidelines  are  that  the  combined  fees  charged  for  water  and  sanitation,  and  SWM\nshould not exceed 6 percent of the household income. On this basis, the charge for sewerage\nand  drainage  should  not  be  greater  than  2.5  percent.  The  direct  user  fees  proposed  for\ndomestic consumers will represent 1.3 percent of the median household income (Rs3,700 per\nmonth in 1999) and 1.9 percent for the low-income household (Rs2,670 per month) in the year\nFY2002.  Projections  indicate  that  the  direct  user  fees  will  not  exceed  more  than  2  percent  to\nFY2010.  The  consolidated  rate  charge  is  also  used  as  an  indirect  cost  recovery  mechanism.\nThe  average  consolidated  rate  charge  payment  is  around  Rs4000  per  year  (based  on  Rs1.5\nbillion estimate of current assessments for the whole CMC). From this amount, 15 percent is to\nbe allocated to sewerage and drainage services. This represents Rs600 yearly or Rs50 monthly\nfor  the  average  household.  This  is  equivalent  to  1.3  percent  of  the  median  household  income\nand 1.9 percent of income for the low-income households.\n\n31.\nThe sum of both direct and indirect user charges represents 2.6 percent of the median\nhousehold income and 3.8 percent of the low-income households. On this basis, the proposed\nfee levels are considered to be affordable for the median income households. Most low-income\nhouseholds  will  not  pay  the  consolidated  rate  charge,  or  will  pay  an  amount  much  lower  than\nRs4,000  per  year.  This  will  represent  a  cross-subsidy  mechanism  from  the  wealthier  to  the\npoorer  segments  of  the  population.  The  socioeconomic  analysis  found  that  90  percent  of  the\nhouseholds were willing to pay Rs50 per month for these services.\n\n32.\nFor SWM the indirect fees collected though the 15 percent allocation of the consolidated\nrate  charge will also  represent  1.3 percent of the income of median income households. Poor\nhouseholds  will  not  be  affected  by  the  tariff  for  the  same  reasons  as  in  the  sewerage  and\ndrainage component.\n\n5.\n\nFinancial Evaluation of CMC\n\nDetailed  financial  projections  are  prepared  for  the  FY2000-2012  period  on  the  basis  of\n33.\nthe  assumptions  set  out  above,  the  proposed  cost  recovery  mechanisms,  the  proposed\noperational  requirements,  and  the  population  forecast  and  planning  targets.  The  projections\nshow  that  CMC\u2019s  financial  position  improves  over  the  forecast  period.  CMC  is  able  to  make  a\ncapital contribution to funding the Project, meet its ongoing operating costs, and also meet the\ndebt servicing of the funds relent from the state government. Loan relending terms assume a 25\nyear  repayment  period,  including  a  6  year  grace  period,  at  a  13  percent  interest  rate.  By  the\ncompletion of the Project in FY2007, property taxes will represent 30 percent of CMC\u2019s revenue\nbase, user fees for water supply and sewerage 18 percent, and state entitlements 44 percent.\nWhile  projections  result  in  deficits  in  FY2000,  2001,  and  2002,  CMC  will  generate  overall\nsurpluses from FY2003 due to increases in property tax and user charges and reforms to state\ntaxes transferred to CMC. These improvements allow CMC to meet its capital contribution to the\nProject and meet the debt service on the ADB loan (from FY2008).\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 16 November 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "-\n=\n=\n", "Indian Rupee/s (Re/Rs)\n$0.021\nRs46.675\n", "The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by the Reserve Bank of India under a system of\nmanaged float.
