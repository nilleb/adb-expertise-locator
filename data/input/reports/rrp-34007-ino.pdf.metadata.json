The Project\nwill be implemented in two phases in 50 districts and 12 cities of 7 provinces:\nAceh, Bali, Bengkulu, Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Riau, and Southeast\nSulawesi. In the first phase, activities will concentrate on developing local\ncapacity to plan, manage and deliver health services. Local governments and\nhealth offices will prepare health sector development plans and investment\nproposals  to  improve  service  quality,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness,  and\nproposals to introduce locally appropriate health sector reforms. In the second\nphase,  the  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  technically  and\neconomically justified proposals that address the priority needs of the poor\nand vulnerable groups.\nClassification Primary: Human development\nSecondary: Poverty reduction\nEnvironmental Where new facilities are constructed, an environmental impact assessment\nAssessment and environmental management and monitoring plans will be prepared before\nthe  subproject  proposal  is  approved.  With  expected  improvement  in\nsanitation,  the  overall  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  environment  will  be\npositive.\nRationale Implementation of decentralization will start in early 2001, in accordance\nwith the laws on decentralization voted in May 1999. Decentralization\noffers opportunities to better answer local health needs through locally\nadapted reforms and specific investments in the health sector. However,\nrapid implementation of decentralization could create a major risk of\nbreakdown  in  the  delivery  of  public  health  services  because  the\ntraditionally  centralized  planning  and  management  of  health  services\nhave not prepared local staff adequately to take over this responsibility.\nThere is a need to support local health staff during the transition period\nand prepare them for their new responsibilities. While assisting local\ngovernments to maintain health services delivery, the Project will help\nlocal governments identify local needs, giving priority to programs that\ntarget and benefit the poor, and improve health service quality.\nObjectives The  objectives  are  to  strengthen  local  capacity  in  health  services\nand Scope delivery,  including  planning  and  management,  to  ensure  continuous\naccess to quality health and family planning services, particularly by the\npoor; and to improve quality, cost-efficiency, and sustainability of health\nand family planning services in the project area. Advocacy, training, and\ntechnical support will first build up local governments\u2019 commitment and\ncapacity.  Subsequently,  the  Project  will  help  districts  and  provinces\nimplement appropriate health sector reforms and support investments to\nbetter address the needs of the poor and vulnerable groups and improve\nservices quality, efficiency, and effectiveness.", "iii\nActivities are grouped into four components: (i) advocacy and capacity\nbuilding; (ii) adapting health services to local needs through appropriate\nhealth sector reforms; (iii) investments for health and family planning;\nand (iv) project management, including implementation, monitoring, and\nevaluation.\nCost Estimates The estimated total cost of the Project is $87.0 million equivalent, of which\n$36.7 million is the foreign exchange cost, and $50.3 million equivalent is the\nlocal currency cost.\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nAsian Development Bank 36.7 28.3 65.0 74.7\nGovernment - 22.0 22.0 25.3\nTotal 36.7 50.3 87.0 100\nLoan Amount A  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights\nand Terms 50,531,000 from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds\nresources with a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8\nyears. It will carry 1 percent interest charge during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent thereafter.\nConsidering Indonesia\u2019s economic difficulties and fiscal constraints in\nthe short term, it is proposed that ADB finance 80 percent of the\nproject  cost  during  the  first  three  years  of  implementation  and  60\npercent during the last two years. This proposal is in accordance with\nthe  graduation  policy,  which  allows  ADB  financing  to  exceed  the\ncountry cost-sharing limit under exceptional circumstances and where\njustified on project grounds.\nPeriod of Utilization 30 September 2006\nExecuting Agency The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare\n(MOHSW). The National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN)\nwill  support  MOHSW  for  the  family  planning  and  family  welfare\nactivities of the Project.\nImplementation In each district, a district health committee \u2013 with representatives from the\nArrangements local government, district health services and BKKBN, and civil society\u2013will\nparticipate in identifying appropriate local investments and reforms and\nmonitoring implementation. A district implementation unit will be responsible\nfor  implementing  project  activities.  A  provincial  technical  review  team\ninvolving  technical  experts  and  representatives  of  the  community,  will\ncomment on the district proposals. In each province, a project coordination\nand  implementation  unit  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  at  the\nprovincial level and support to the districts. A central project coordination\nunit in MOHSW will coordinate project activities between all provinces and\ndistricts. A central technical committee and a central steering committee will", "iv\nprovide overall technical and policy guidance, respectively, to the Project.\nProcurement All ADB-financed civil works and goods will be procured in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  For  procurement  of  goods,\ninternational competitive bidding will apply for contracts estimated to\ncost $500,000 equivalent or more. Supply contracts for goods other than\nvehicles,  motorcycles  and  office  equipment  estimated  to  cost  the\nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  less  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational shopping (IS). Civil works contract \u2013 all estimated to cost\nless  than  1.0  million  equivalent  -  and  supply  contract  for  vehicles,\nmotorcycles and office equipment will be awarded on the basis of local\ncompetitive bidding (LCB). Civil works contracts valued at less than\n$50,000 equivalent may involve the participation of local communities in\naccordance with procedures to be agreed with ADB. Direct purchase of\ngoods costing less than $50,000 equivalent will be allowed.\nConsulting Services International  and  domestic  consultants  and  consulting  firms  will  be\nengaged  to  (i)  support  project  implementation  units  and  technical\ncommittees, and (ii) provide technical expertise. Part of the consulting\nservices  provision  will  be  reserved  to  provide  project  managers\nflexibility in engaging consultants according to local needs identified\nduring  phase  I  of  the  Project.  To  support  project  management,\ndomestic consultants will be engaged, where needed, to complement\nexisting staff capabilities. Depending on the needs of the 62 districts\nand cities, a maximum of 4,394 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices  may  be  required  for  project  management.  To  provide\ntechnical expertise, the Project will fund a total of 37 person-months of\ninternational and 225 person-months of domestic consulting services.\nLocal consulting firms will be recruited for information technology, and\nenvironmental and social impact assessments. All consultants will be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 1 March 2006\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and Poor and vulnerable groups in the project area will particularly benefit from\nBeneficiaries the Project. The Project will facilitate continuous availability of quality health\nservices  during  the  difficult  period  of  transition  to  decentralization.\nInvestments and reform proposals from the districts will address the needs\nof the local poor. Capacity-building activities will benefit not only health staff\nbut also other members of the civil society. The Project aims at a minimum\nof 50 percent women among the beneficiaries of the training activities.\nProject Risks The main project risks relate to the fast pace of implementation of\ndecentralization, resulting in lack of clarity and understanding of the\nnew roles and responsibilities of the various levels and institutions. The\nweak capacity of the district and provincial staff due to the traditional\ncentralized  system  will  be  addressed  through  intensive  capacity-\nbuilding activities at the beginning of implementation. As a condition for", "v\nproject implementation in the district, availability of counterpart funds\nmust be guaranteed by the head of the concerned district.\nTechnical The  Project  will  be  accompanied  by  technical  assistance  (TA)  to\nAssistance support policy reforms in the health sector. The TA will permit the\nGovernment, and districts and provinces in the project area to take\nadvantage  of  decentralization  to  identify,  develop,  and  implement\nlocally  appropriate  health  sector  reforms.  The  TA  will  finance  36\nperson-months of an individual consultant, based in Jakarta, to work\nwith  the  MOHSW  policy  advisory  group.  The  consultant  will  be\nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants. The TA will also finance operations research, advocacy,\nand studies in support of health sector reforms. The TA is proposed to\nbe financed from the Japan Special Fund (JSF). Application for the\nfinancing from JSF has been made to the Government of Japan. The\napplication  for  JSF  funding  is  under  review  by  the  Government  of\nJapan.", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Decentralized Health Services Project. The Report also\ndescribes proposed technical assistance for Support for Health Sector Policy Reforms, and if\nthe proposed loan is approved by the Board, and subject to the approval of the Government of\nJapan having been obtained for the financing of the technical assistance from the Japan Special\nFund1 (JSF), I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the\ntechnical assistance.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2.  In May 1999, the Indonesian Parliament adopted two laws2 requiring decentralization of\nGovernment  services  and  functions  by  2001.  The  principal  feature  of  the  legislation  is\nsubstantial  delegation  of  operational  authority  and  responsibility  to  Indonesia\u2019s  districts.\nDecentralization will impose significant structural and financial changes. Although the legislation\nprovides  the  broad  framework  for  decentralization,  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization\nimplementation  plans  have  not  been  finalized.  Many  regulations  are  still  in  draft  or  under\ndiscussion, including those on (i) transfer of civil servants, assets, and spending authorities to\nthe districts; (ii) fiscal transfers and shared revenues required to finance transferred functions;\n(iii) guidelines for local government borrowing; (iv) accountability of local governments, financial\nmanagement, and adherence to the budget process; and (v) financial information systems. A\nrapid shift from a highly centralized system to a system providing considerable (but not fully\ndefined) autonomy to poorly prepared district administrations risks disruption of essential social\nservices,  including  health  services.  This  prompted  the  Government  to  seek  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance to support decentralization in the health sector. In March\n2000, the Government asked the ADB Country Program Consultation Mission to process the\nDecentralized Health Services Project for implementation beginning in early 2001.\n3.  A technical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission in April 2000 confirmed the potential\nimpacts on the health of the population, particularly the poor and the vulnerable groups, and\ndeveloped  a  small-scale  TA3  to  support  project  processing.  In  May  2000,  an  ADB  team\ndeveloped  the  project  framework  (Appendix  1)  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Health\n(MOH).4 Workshops were organized with representatives of all districts in several provinces to\nreview and adapt the framework to the local context and to start preparing investment proposals\nbased on the framework. For the first time, frameworks and initial investment proposals were\nprepared independently by the beneficiaries. Domestic consultants funded by TA helped the\ndistricts and provinces present their proposals in a standardized format. A Loan Fact-Finding\nMission (5-30 June 2000) visited districts and provinces and reached an understanding with\nrepresentatives of the local and central governments on project coverage and implementation\nstrategy.  During  the  Appraisal  Mission5  (25  September\u201323  October  2000),  the  districts\n                                                \n1  An application has been made to the Government of Japan for the financing of the technical assistance from the\nJapan Special Fund. The application is currently under consideration.\n2  Law on Regional Autonomy (Law No. 22/99) and Law on Fiscal Balance (Law No. 25/99).\n3  TA 3448-INO: Decentralized Health Services, for $150,000, approved on 26 May 2000, supplemented by a\n$30,000 grant from the Government of Australia.\n4  In August 2000, the ministry was renamed the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW).\n5  The Mission comprised J. Jeugmans, Senior Social Sector Specialist/Mission Leader; P. Stokoe, Resident Adviser\nin  Indonesia  for  Health  Sector;  P.  Spantigati,  Programs  Officer;  K.  Emzita,  Counsel;  M.  Sultana,  Social\nDevelopment Specialist; K. Takamiya, Young Professional, Economist; S. Kataoka, Staff Consultant, Financial\nAnalyst. The Mission was assisted by D. Kelaher, Health Sector Development Specialist, under TA financed by", "2\npresented their preliminary investment proposals, including inputs from the provinces and the\nMinistry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Based on the proposals, field visits, and\ndiscussions with local beneficiaries and stakeholders, and in agreement with MOHSW, the\nNational Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN), the National Development Planning\nAgency (BAPPENAS), and the Ministry of Finance, the Appraisal Mission finalized the project\nproposal. The proposal was negotiated in Manila on 16-17 November 2000.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Performance and Organization\n4.  The health status of the Indonesian population gradually improved over the last three\ndecades. The infant mortality rate for example declined from 145 infant deaths per thousand live\nbirths in 1970 to 40 in 1999.6 However, the maternal mortality rate (MMR)\u2013estimated between\n390 and 450 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births\u2013is among the highest in the region and is\nvery high by international standards.7 While most health and nutrition indicators have improved,\nIndonesia\u2019s  health  indicators  remain  disappointing  compared  with  those  of  neighboring\ncountries.8 Moreover, such gains were uneven and significant differences remained between\nregions and provinces, between urban and rural areas, and especially between the rich and the\npoor. Although cardiovascular and chronic diseases became the main cause of mortality in\n1992, infectious and parasitic diseases dominate morbidity and are still a major cause of deaths,\naffecting particularly the poor. Tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory infections, and diarrhea are\nmajor public health issues. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Government made serious efforts\nto develop a network of health facilities and ensure physical access to health services all over\nthe country. This policy was relatively successful in achieving physical targets: the average\ndistance to a health center or a hospital is 5 kilometers (km) in rural areas and 1.5 km in urban\nareas.  But  the  use  of  health  services  (bed  occupancy  rates  in  hospitals,  outpatient\nconsultations) has been low, at least in the public sector, suggesting low client satisfaction.\nAppendix 2 gives information on medical issues in the project area.\n5.  The impact of the economic crisis, which started in 1997, is not yet fully reflected in\nbroad health indicators such as MMR, infant mortality rate, and mortality among children under\nfive years. Several surveys focusing on populations and regions at higher risk indicate that the\ncrisis has particularly affected the poor in both urban and rural areas and the populations at risk.\nFor example, malnutrition in children and women (pregnant women and lactating mothers) has\nbecome of particular concern. Before the crisis, growth retardation measured on a height-for-\nage scale9 was estimated to affect 25 percent of the children, and the incidence of low birth\nweight was about 15 percent. With the crisis, health services started reporting cases of severe\nmalnutrition. Follow-up studies indicate that, while the average weight for age was not affected\n                                                                                                                                                         \nAusAID) and domestic consultants Pohan, Hussein, Poerwanto, Laksono (under TA 3448-INO); and Nur and\nArbanto (on loan from other ADB health projects in Indonesia).\n6  1999 data are from UNICEF. Official MOH data, based on the Demographic and Health Survey and the health\nmodule of the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) are available only up to 1997 and 1998 respectively.\n7  The usual causes of maternal mortality (hemorrhage, infections, and obstructed labor) are occurring in women also\noften affected by malnutrition.\n8  The Human Development Index 2000, which combines health, educational and economic achievements, ranks\nIndonesia 109th of 174 countries, compared with Singapore 24th, Malaysia 60th, Thailand 76th, Philippines 77th and\nChina 99 th.\n9  Reduced height-for-age (stunting) is an indicator of long-lasting malnutrition, while reduced weight-for-age is an\nindicator of recent malnutrition.", "3\nby the crisis, there were wider variations than before (as reflected by the statistical standard\ndeviations): children who were most at risk or already suffering from mild forms of malnutrition\nbecame severely malnourished.10\n6.  Indonesia has developed a successful family planning program, organized by BKKBN.\nWith its slogan \u201cSmall Happy Family,\u201d BKKBN advocates birth spacing and small families, and\nensures availability of modern methods of contraception all over the country, resulting in a\nsignificant contraceptive prevalence rate (at 57.4 percent in1997). The average number of births\nper woman during her childbearing age (i.e., the total fertility rate) declined from 4.1 in 1985 to\n2.5 in 1999, and the annual population growth rate steadily decreased from 2.2 percent in 1985\nto 1.7 percent in 1993. BKKBN is centrally organized and managed with a hierarchy down to the\nsubdistricts. Policy and programs are developed, monitored, and evaluated at the central level.\nBKKBN village volunteers provide general information on contraception in their community, and\nsupport contraceptive users (reminding for example pill users not to forget their daily pill).\nBKKBN field-workers advocate family planning in the community, supervise village volunteers,\nand collect field data for monitoring and evaluating the program. MOHSW health center or\ndistrict  hospital  staff  are  responsible  for  medical  examinations  and  interventions  (providing\ninjections, inserting intrauterine devices). Although the relatively narrow scope of the family\nplanning  program  (compared  with  MOHSW  programs)  makes  implementation  less  difficult,\nsome features of the program, particularly its flexibility and results-oriented approach, have\nprobably contributed to its success. Different targets are established for each province, and\ndifferent  program  components  are  emphasized,  taking  into  consideration  the  local  social,\npolitical, and economic conditions. BKKBN has also been relatively successful in mobilizing\nresources from aid agencies, the Government, and the private sector.\n7.  The Indonesian health system relies heavily on the public sector, which, until now, has\nbeen highly centralized. In the past, the health ministry in Jakarta developed health programs\nand allocated resources according to centrally defined priorities based on data collected in the\nfield but consolidated and analyzed centrally. Government line ministries have representative\noffices  in  the  provinces  and  the  districts  responsible  for  transmitting  and  ensuring\nimplementation of the central ministries\u2019 instructions. In parallel, each province and district have\na  sector  unit  (Dinas)  technically  responsible  to  the  provincial  or  district  government  and\nadministratively responsible to the provincial governor or the administrative head of the district\n(bupati).11 Collaboration between the two offices is necessary but sometimes difficult because of\ndifferent priorities at the central and local levels. At the district level, the head of the district\nhealth services represents both MOHSW and the district health office that reports to the bupati.\nIn the last few years, the former MOH has accelerated decentralization in the health sector,\nincreasing  the  authority  of  the  provincial  and  district  offices  for  planning,  budgeting,  and\nprogram implementation, but many centrally developed health programs remained in place.\nPersonnel management is centralized. Although governors and bupatis administer their staff in\nthe provincial and district offices (assignment, promotion), the central level pays salaries. Young\ngraduates under contract are assigned to the provinces and districts by the central level.\n8.  The private sector plays an important role in the delivery of health services in many\nplaces. Almost everywhere, doctors in the public system also provide private services after\n                                                \n10 Data from Central Bureau of Statistics on MOH Nutrition Unit presented by ADB at the 9th meeting of the\nConsultative Group on Indonesia, Jakarta, February 2000.\n11 Governors and bupatis were previously centrally appointed and reported to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Now they\nare elected by the members of the province and district parliaments (DPRD). Larger cities have an administrative\nstatus and structure comparable to that of districts; for simplicity, references in the text to districts and bupatis\nsubsume cities and city mayors (walikota) within the project area.", "4\noffice hours. Typically in better-off areas, especially in urban communities, full-time private\npractitioners also offer their services. The availability of these private for-profit services is linked\nto community income\u2013or poverty\u2013status. In the richer provinces (Bali, Riau), private for-profit\nhealth services are available and offer quality services. In many rural areas and less favored\nurban areas, religious and other nongovernment organizations (NGOs), usually not for profit,\nhave set up health centers and sometimes small hospitals for the local populations, often filling\ngap coverage or complementing the public sector. In 1998, 40.7 percent, 52.7 percent, and 4.5\npercent  of  the  population  were  using  public,  private,  and  traditional  health  care  services,\nrespectively (SUSENAS data). Unfortunately, public and private sectors have been developing\nand  functioning  in  parallel,  with  very  little  coordination  and  cooperation,  except  in  family\nplanning, where BKKBN strongly supported the demand for and provision of private family\nplanning services for those who could afford them.\n9.  Total expenditure for health is low, increasing slightly from 1.0 percent of gross domestic\nproduct  (GDP)  in  1995,  to  1.2  percent  in  1998.  As  a  percentage  of  total  Government\nexpenditure, health expenditures varied from 2.9 percent in 1985, 3.3 percent in 1995, and 2.9\npercent  in  1998.  Regardless  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  health  sector,  the\neconomic downturn reduced available resources. In real terms, Government health expenditure\ndeclined by 16.5 percent between 1995 and 1998. Out-of-pocket payments by households\ndeclined from 69 percent of total health expenditure in 1995 to 42 percent in 1998 reflecting, in\npart, more limited household resources. The difference was covered by an increase in external\nsupport. The Government has committed to allocate at least 3 percent of the FY2000 budget\nand at least 4 percent of the FY2001 budget for health, nutrition, and family planning programs.\nChronically low funding of public health services affects service quality and effectiveness, which\nin turn have an impact on the use of public health services and the health status of the\npopulation.\n2.  Constraints and Issues\n10.  The health service delivery system, managed centrally from Jakarta, no longer answers\nadequately the needs and the demand of the local populations. Despite relatively satisfactory\nphysical coverage, given the geographic and climatic constraints, health indicators have not\nimproved as rapidly as those in neighboring countries. Relatively poor health service quality in\nthe public sector affects service utilization12 and effectiveness. There is a need to rehabilitate\nand upgrade some facilities and improve medical equipment, both for diagnostic and curative\npurpose. Besides insufficient financing and insufficient attention to local needs, major issues\nrelate to the lack of local personnel sufficiently qualified in health service management and to\nstructural and organizational issues.\n11.  A consequence of a centrally managed health system is a generally weak management\ncapacity  at  the  local  level.  With  some  exceptions,  local  health  staff  have  been  trained  to\nimplement instructions but not to take initiative and responsibility. Health workers have been\nrequired to apply centrally developed instructions, often without clearly understanding why.\nTheir performance is evaluated based on process indicators rather than outputs: a certain\nnumber of reports must be filled, and national programs request regular data on program\nactivities. The impact of these activities on health and nutrition status is not the responsibility of\nlocal staff. Health indicators are collated and analyzed at the central level with little feedback on\nresults to local staff.\n                                                \n12Recent surveys indicate that service utilization increased significantly during and after the crisis.", "5\n12.  Centralized  organization  creates  duplication,  inefficiency,  and  waste.  Effective\ncollaboration and coordination between the MOHSW provincial office reporting to MOHSW and\nthe  provincial  health  services  office  reporting  to  the  local  government  have  depended  on\npersonalities, rather than on clear job descriptions and sharing of tasks. There is a need to\nstreamline  the  health  sector  administrative  organization  in  the  district  and  the  province.\nDecentralization provides the opportunity and heightens the need for reorganization, but it also\ncreates insecurity and uncertainty among local health staff.\n13.  Financial management systems are fragmented, complicated, and cumbersome. Most\nfunding is still controlled from the center and distributed through vertical programs. Different\nbudget sources raise problems with predictability of resource flows. Accountability is weak:\nfinancial expenditures are not linked to expected outcomes or analyzed to assess whether funds\nare efficiently expended. There is little review of overall program management and efficiency in\ndelivery of health services.\n14.  MOHSW has lately been making significant efforts to develop a managed care scheme\nrelying  on  health  insurance  with  the  objective  of  improving  efficiency  and  mobilizing  new\nresources for the health sector. For many years, the former MOH has promoted a small village-\nbased insurance scheme to cover outpatient health services. Other insurance schemes exist for\nthe  private  sector  and  for  civil  servants.  Over  the  last  few  years,  the  ministry  has  been\nadvocating a national health insurance scheme (JPKM), similar in many respects to health\nmaintenance organizations in the United States but managed at local (district and province)\nlevels. JPKM has been pilot-tested in several districts, but several aspects of the scheme need\nto be revised. Health care financing, however, is an issue that local governments will have to\nface. If the national health insurance system is flexible, decentralization offers the opportunity to\nadapt the system to local conditions.\n15.  The development of the private health sector for-profit or not-for-profit NGOs signals the\nimportance of client satisfaction. Underutilization of public health facilities, particularly before the\ncrisis, reflects low popularity. Studies show that the share of the public sector in the provision of\nhealth care services, at 45 percent in 1997, declined to 40 percent in 1998 (before the impact of\nthe crisis could be assessed. On the other hand, the share of private outpatient facilities\nincreased from 46 percent to 52 percent from 1997 to 199813 (but apparently fell in 1999 as a\nresult of the crisis). Before the economic crisis, falls in contact rates were particularly notable in\npublic health centers and subcenters.\n3.  Health and Poverty\n16.  A comparison of the richer and the poorer quintiles of the population shows that health\nindicators improve with the wealth of the quintiles.14 Use of health services and access to\nmedical doctors also increase with the wealth of the patient. Table 1, referring to women\u2019s use\nof health services and based on preliminary analysis of 1998 SUSENAS data, indicates that at\nall levels in the private and the public sector, the poor consult modern health practitioners less\nfrequently when ill. These figures reflect a precrisis situation. More recent information, still under\nanalysis, suggests that patients shifted from the private to the public sector during the crisis,\nespecially for primary health care services in the health centers. The poor more often use self-\nmedication, and overall, women are more likely than men to use self-medication. On the other\nhand, parents often consult health professionals when a child is sick. Another source of data,\n                                                \n13 Traditional healers and self-treatment are the main other mechanisms for patients to get health care services.\n14 The World Bank. Socio-Economic Differences in Health, Nutrition and Population - Indonesia, May 2000.", "6\nMOHSW hospital-based data,15 suggests that the poor can rarely afford hospital services: in\n1998 in public sector hospitals, 3.9 percent of outpatient and 1.2 percent of inpatient services\nwere for individuals categorized as poor.\nTable 1: Sources of Treatment by Poverty Quintiles for Women\n(%)\nWomen\nSource Children Men\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Total\nPublic Hospitals 1.3 1.7 2.6 3.6 5.4 2.9 2.3 3.3\nPrivate services 6.7 9.3 13.3 19.3 33.6 16.2 17.2 17.7\nHealth Centers 42.2 41.3 40.5 36.1 24.4 37.1 52.1 37.9\nTraditional Healer 4.8 4.2 4.0 3.2 2.3 3.7 3.3 4.0\nand Others\nSelf Medication 45.1 43.3 39.7 37.8 34.3 40.1 25.1 38.1\nSource: preliminary analysis of SUSENAS data 1998.\n17.  As the poor cannot afford private health services except those from not-for-profit NGOs,\nthe relatively low quality and ineffectiveness of the public health sector particularly affect their\nhealth status. Child malnutrition rates in Indonesia are high and malnutrition remains a serious\nproblem  for  vulnerable  population  groups.  The  difference  among  economic  groups  has\nnarrowed, but malnutrition rates among children from poorer households are still well above\nthose of the wealthier groups. In 1996, about 35 percent of preschoolers were underweight and\nsuffered from protein-energy malnutrition.\n18.  The centralized management of health services implied planning and budgeting from the\nsupply side point of view. To improve equity and access to health services for the poor and\nvulnerable groups, Government resources were allocated to services and facilities in poorer\nareas. To maintain access to health services for the poor, tariffs in health care services were\nsubsidized for everybody. However, only the cost of providing services was considered, not the\ncost of getting services, which includes travel, waiting time, and opportunity costs, often more\nsignificant for the poor relative to income. Consequently, middle class and better-off populations\nwere often the main beneficiaries of the Government\u2019s efforts to ensure universal access to\nhealth services.16\n19.  The economic crisis in 1997 was expected to have a negative impact on the delivery of\nessential social services and constrain access to and utilization of essential education, health,\nand nutrition services by the poor and vulnerable groups. Urgent and well-targeted action was\nneeded to reduce the impact of the crisis on the poor, protect utilization of basic health services,\nand control reemergence of severe malnutrition and communicable diseases. It was particularly\nimportant to protect the health and nutrition of pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children\nunder two years of age. Providing ready access to qualified health providers and adequate\nhealth services, and improving maternal health care were expected to have a strongly positive\nimpact on the health of women, their children, and their families. But since these groups were\n                                                \n15Division of Information, Directorate General of Medical Care, MOH.\n16 The alternative is to link resources with demand, and to subsidize the consumers (the poor) rather than the\nproviders (health services and facilities).", "7\nless likely to visit health centers, strengthened community outreach activities supported by\nvillage midwives17 were critical.\n20.  In response to the crisis, the Government developed a Social Safety Net Program for\nHealth  (JPS-BK)  and  education  with  ADB  assistance.18  Through  JPS-BK,  the  Government\nadopted a comprehensive set of policy measures to help reduce the impact of the crisis on the\nmost vulnerable groups while laying the foundation for longer term, sustainable health sector\nreform. Nationwide policy reforms were designed to safeguard access of the poor to basic\nhealth services and to strengthen management of health services delivery through progressive\ndecentralization of operational responsibilities. The policy reforms concentrated on maintaining\naccess of the poor and vulnerable groups to essential health, nutrition, and family planning\nservices;  maintaining  quality  of  services  provided  to  the  poor;  enhancing  decentralized\nmanagement,  participation,  and  transparency;  and  improving  efficiency.  The  JPS-BK  was\nexpected to benefit economic and social development by ensuring that the targeted vulnerable\ngroups and individuals retained access to basic health services, preserving levels of basic\nhealth and nutrition essential to current and future productivity. Agreed-upon policy reforms\nwould  improve  the  efficiency  and  quality  of  health,  family  planning,  and  nutrition  services\ndelivery  systems.  The  management  and  administrative  capacity  of  local  communities  and\noffices would improve through involvement in planning and implementing the JPS-BK.\n21.  An  innovative  block  grant  mechanism  was  introduced  to  enable  health  centers  to\nmaintain the quality and outreach of their services. The block grants also enabled village\nmidwives to better target their services to help ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable\ngroups  were  not  denied  access  to  medical  treatment.  The  continued  availability  of  basic\noutpatient services through the network of health centers was ensured. Immunization programs\nfor  children  were  maintained;  and  surveillance,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  of  communicable\ndiseases,  especially  acute  respiratory  infections  among  children,  and  tuberculosis,  were\nstrengthened. Outreach activities by midwives, BKKBN field workers, and community health\nvolunteers that provide the critical link between the public health system and the poor, who\nmight not otherwise utilize essential health and nutrition services, were expanded.\n22.  Preliminary evaluation of the JPS-BK program indicates that, despite some weaknesses,\nresources reached the targeted communities and probably protected the populations from a\nmajor deterioration of their health status. Utilization of public health services improved. Health\ncenters contact rates increased dramatically: in most provinces, 12 to 15 percent of poor\nfamilies visited the health centers the preceding month, four times the precrisis frequencies.\nSurveys also show that the proportion of births attended by trained health personnel rose\nsharply.  With  aggressive  outreach  programs  to  identify  pregnant  women  and  to  provide\nadequate prenatal care, the proportion of attended births increased substantially, and in some\nprovinces doubled. The decline in nutritional status among pregnant women and young children\nwas arrested by mid-1999 and has improved since. Overall, utilization of health services and\nhealth staff greatly increased during a difficult period when comparable crisis situations in other\ncountries resulted in a decline, rather than an increase in such services.\n                                                \n17  Village midwives are generally young women with some prior nursing education who are given one year of training\nprior to posting to villages.\n18 Loan 1622/1623-INO: Social Protection Sector Development Program (SPSDP), for $300 million, approved in 1998\n(with 50.8 percent of the loan amount for the health sector). Loan 1675/1676-INO: Health and Nutrition Sector\nDevelopment Program (HNSDP), for $300 million, approved in 1999. The SPSDP and HNSDP are described more\nfully in para. 41.", "8\n23.  Available evidence suggests that the JPS-BK has had a positive influence on sustaining\nessential health services (e.g., maternal and child care programs and immunization). However it\nis too early to assess the full health consequences of the crisis or the mitigating effects of the\nJPS-BK program. Equally, it is too early to assess the impact of crisis interventions on long-term\nhealth indicators such as MMR, although JPS-BK has focused on the principal contributing\nfactors  of  MMR.  But  routinely  collected  data,  special  surveys,  and  anecdotal  information\nsuggest  that  the  impacts  of  the  crisis  have  been  mitigated  and,  in  fact,  crisis-motivated\ninterventions have had a strongly positive influence on the health of women and young children.\nMaintaining  access  of  the  poor  to  basic  health,  nutrition,  and  family  planning  services  is\nessential to ensure their continued health and productivity. During the crisis, the Government\nmaintained resources allocated to essential health services at precrisis levels. However, it used\nmainly external assistance to finance JPS-BK. In the longer term, improved coverage and better\nservice quality will require both a significant increase in resources allocated to the health sector\nand better use of the resources provided. The Government needs to identify new mechanisms\nfor using domestic financial resources to continue protecting the poor in a sustainable way.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n1.  Health Policy and Services\n24.  The 1999 state guidelines provide guidance for health sector policy. To improve the\nquality  of  human  resources  and  the  environment,  the  Government  will  emphasize  health\npromotion and prevention of diseases, in combination with curative services, recovery, and\nrehabilitation. For better quality health institutions and services, staff will be developed, facilities\nand infrastructure improved, and affordable medicines supplied. Particular attention will be paid\nto the poor, neglected children, disabled, elderly, and socially vulnerable groups. Controlling\npopulation growth and raising the quality of the family planning program remain high priority.\n25.  Healthy Indonesia 2010, developed in 1999, describes MOHSW\u2019s vision, strategy, and\npolicy. The vision is to ensure that the Indonesian people live in a healthy environment with\nhealthy living behavior, and obtain qualified health services that are effective, efficient, and\nevenly  distributed.  People  must  be  actively  involved  in  maintaining  and  promoting  health,\npreventing diseases, and protecting themselves from them. Efforts will focus on four areas: (i)\ncross-sectoral cooperation, (ii) health staff and public empowerment, (ii) quality and accessibility\nof  health  services,  and  (iv)  prioritization  and  funding  of  health  activities.  Cross-sectoral\ncooperation is important to ensure a healthy environment. Professional management of health\nservices with participation of the community will determine the success of the policy. The health\npolicy should prioritize health promotion and maintenance, and disease prevention. Funding for\nhealth activities should increase, especially for health maintenance and promotion; and curative\nand  rehabilitative  activities  need  to  be  financed  more  by  society.  This  will  require  the\ndevelopment of an efficient, equitable, and participatory health prepayment system and better\ncollaboration with the private sector. MOHSW has defined four priority strategies: national\ndevelopment  with  health  concerns,  better  professional  qualification,  strengthening  health\nmaintenance insurance, and decentralization.19\n                                                \n19 This summary was presented by the minister of health on 18 March 2000 at a seminar on health development in\nthe context of decentralization.", "9\n2.  Decentralization\n26.  Although decentralization has been on the political agenda for many years, adoption by\nthe Parliament in May 1999 of Law 22 and Law 25 sharply accelerated the process. The laws\nprovide a broad framework and define the timetable: decentralization of the Government\u2019s\nservices  and  functions  must  be  implemented  in  2001,  transferring  major  management,\nadministrative, and fiscal responsibilities mainly to the districts. District authorities and district\nparliaments (DPRDs) will be directly responsible for identifying local needs, addressing local\nissues, choosing locally suitable solutions, mobilizing necessary resources, and implementing\nappropriate decisions and plans of action. In addition, all functions that are not specifically\nassigned in Law No. 22/99 to central and provincial levels automatically belong to districts.\nAlthough  the  legislation  provides  the  broad  framework  for  decentralization,  implementation\nplans have not been finalized, with many regulations still in draft or under discussion, including\nregulations on (i) transfer of civil servants, assets, and spending authority to the districts; (ii)\nfiscal transfer and revenue-sharing arrangements required to finance transfer functions; (iii)\nguidelines for local government borrowing; (iv) accountability of local governments, financial\nmanagement, and budget procedures; and (v) financial information system.\n27.  Under decentralization, the roles and functions of the central MOHSW will be limited to\nformulating the national health policy and plans, and assisting the local governments to achieve\nnationwide objectives through resource mobilization and allocation. More specifically, MOHSW\nwill set national standards and guidelines on nutrition, medical education, food and medicine\nquality and distribution, and provincial and district planning, and it will monitor the performance\nof districts and provinces on critical indicators. Districts and provinces will receive block grants\nfrom the central Government, and will be responsible for managing their own health planning\nand budgeting to reflect local needs and priorities and to provide community-oriented health\nservices.\n28.  Local governments will have more control over finances, planning process, civil service\norganizations, and cooperative bodies. Central ministry representative offices in the provinces\nand districts will be absorbed into local government structures under the governor or bupati.\nBupatis will be fully autonomous and there will be no hierarchical relationship with provinces.\nThey will function solely as the head of the autonomous district government, and be directly and\nsolely responsible to the DPRD. The district executive arm is to be more accountable to the\ndistrict DPRD, which will elect the bupati and his or her deputies with no interference from the\ncenter.\n29.  The Government is drafting regulations describing in detail criteria and formulas for\nallocating funds from the central Government to local governments, consistent with Law 25/99.\nIn addition to locally generated revenues, local governments will receive transfers through a\nproposed \u2018equalization fund.\u2019 Resource transfers through the equalization fund will have three\ncomponents: (i) shares of central Government revenues from land and building taxes and\nrevenues from natural resources; (ii) a block grant General Allocation Fund (GAF), based on\nfactors including population and poverty incidence, that aims to equalize regional differences;\nand  (iii)  an  earmarked  Special  Allocation  Fund  (SAF)  allocated  for  specific  programs  or\npurposes determined by the sectoral minister. GAF aims to balance interregional financial\ncapacity, considering local revenue raising potential, size of the area, geographic conditions,\npopulations, and levels of income. GAF will account for the majority of the funds transferred to\nthe local governments, totaling at least 25 percent of central Government revenues allocated 90\npercent to districts and 10 percent to provinces, as untied block grants. SAF will be allocated to\nsupport projects that fulfill national commitments or priorities or meet special needs. It may not", "10\nbe used for funding administrative costs, training costs, or similar general operating costs. SAF\nallocations will be decided by the technical ministers concerned according to availability of\nresources. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will channel SAF directly into the special account of\nthe region, and the related technical minister will monitor the technical aspects of the project.\n30.  The Government expects decentralization to be implemented in four general phases: (i)\nan initiating phase (2001) when functions, staff, and assets are transferred, and when the key\nobjective is to ensure continuity of services; (ii) a second phase (2002\u20132003) during which\ndecentralization will be completed in all regions, management functions strengthened, and\nbroad programs aimed at upgrading staff skills undertaken; (iii) a consolidation phase (2004\u2013\n2007) during which the decentralization process will be made irreversible and gaps in the legal\nframework corrected; and (iv) a stabilization phase (post-2007) during which regional autonomy\nwill be further strengthened.\n3.   Risks and Opportunities of Decentralization\n31.  Decentralization  represents  a  major  change\u2013and  challenge\u2013for  the  health  system.\nAlthough some funds will be earmarked at the central level for specific health activities, the bulk\nof resources for health will have to come from the budget of the district (and a small part from\nthe budget of the province). Resource allocations among sectors will be proposed by bupatis\nand governors, and approved by district or provincial DPRDs respectively. There is a risk that\nhealth services may not be considered among the priorities because the sector does not bring\nimmediate measurable returns. Strong and systematic advocacy will be needed to convince\nlocal decision makers of the need to maintain, and if possible increase, resource allocations for\noperational costs of and investment in health services.\n32.  The weak managerial capacity of local health staff who are not used to planning and\nmanaging health services without strong central direction creates a risk of disruption in the\nhealth services delivery system. There is a need to strengthen local health staff, and also to\ndevelop local technical expertise (e.g., university and domestic consultants) to support local\nstaff. New regulations in health care financing and in personnel management will force districts\nand provinces to modify the local health system and introduce health sector reforms that suit\ntheir local needs and resources. Immediate issues will be related to health services financing.\nSome poor districts will not have the necessary resources to maintain basic health services.\nGovernment regulations for implementing of Law 25 on Fiscal Balance, providing instructions on\ncost-sharing and resources allocations from the central budget, are still being developed. Until\nthe districts (and provinces) receive clear instructions, there will be major uncertainty in the\nhealth  sector.  Moreover,  bupatis  and  DPRDs  cannot  make  sensible  allocations  of  local\nresources if they do not know exactly how much resources will be available for their district. The\nsituation is similar at the provincial level.\n33.  The  poor  and  women  may  be  seriously  affected  by  decentralization.  Public  health\nservices may be disrupted for several reasons: (i) decreased resources for local health services\nbecause the health sector may be given lower priority in allocation by local parliaments; (ii)\nfunding  may  focus  on  curative  health  care  rather  than  on  primary  health  care,  improved\nmaternal health, and nutrition programs; and (iii) lack of experience of local health staff in health\nservices planning and management. If public health services do not function normally, better-off\npeople would probably turn to private health providers; the poor do not have that option. These\nrisks are compounded by the fact that SPSDP and HNSDP, which funded JPS-BK, are closing\nin  2001.  New  and  locally  appropriate  mechanisms  are  needed  to  fund  and  implement", "11\ncommunity  outreach  programs  to  ensure  health  care  for  the  poor,  safe  motherhood,  and\nnutrition support for malnourished pregnant and lactating women and children under five years.\n34.  Personnel is another issue that local governments will have to address rapidly. About\nthree quarters of all civil servants are central Government employees, but less than 10 percent\nare physically located in the capital. Under decentralization, central Government employees in\ndistricts and provinces are to be transferred to local government payrolls. This may create initial\nproblems, as central Government staff tend to hold managerial positions desired by local staff.\nIn  addition,  there  is  a  major  risk  that  districts,  especially  more  remote  districts,  will  lose\nexperienced  personnel  either  because  financial  incentives  are  not  satisfactory  or  because\nopportunities for career progression in the district are limited.\n35.  While districts are the main focus of decentralization, some medical problems are more\neffectively and cost-efficiently addressed through coordination among neighboring districts and\nsometimes between provinces. Public health issues, particularly infectious diseases such as\nmalaria and tuberculosis, are not limited by administrative boundaries and coordination across\ndistricts is essential to control them. Districts\u2013now autonomous and no longer subordinate to the\nprovinces according to the law\u2013and provinces will have to develop mechanisms that ensure\ncoordination and effectiveness.\n36.  Decentralization, however, also offers tremendous opportunities. With local parliaments\nand local administrative and technical staff responsible for resource allocation, local needs can\nbe given priority. Health services should be able to better answer the demands of the population\nwith locally adapted solutions and increased efficiency. The beneficiaries also will be in direct\ncontact with those who make the decisions. Greater beneficiary involvement should improve\ntransparency. Health sector reforms will have a better chance to succeed because they will be\ndecided locally, based on local circumstances, and will no longer be imposed from Jakarta,\nuniformly for all regions. Finally, mobilization of new financial resources for health may be\neasier. Resources will not be pooled at a national level, with little opportunity for the prospective\nbeneficiaries to decide on their use. With decisions on the use of the resources made locally,\nlocal resources should be more easily mobilized.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n37.  Between 1994 and 1997, external assistance to the health sector was estimated at\nabout $573.11 million. The main sources of assistance were the World Bank, ADB, Japan Bank\nfor  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\n(USAID), Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the Netherlands, and the\nspecialized  United  Nations  (UN)  agencies:  UN  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  UN\nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  UN  Population  Fund  (UNFPA),  and  World  Health  Organization\n(WHO). External assistance supported mainly activities in nutrition, community health, women\u2019s\nhealth, and family planning.\n38.  The World Bank has funded seven health projects in Indonesia since 1992. The Third\nCommunity  Health  and  Population  Project  (1993-1998)  promoted  decentralized  health\nmanagement,  and  the  Fourth  Health  Project  (approved  in  1995)  supported  the  shift  to\nautonomous district-level budgeting and encouraged adoption of quality assurance. The Iodine\nDeficiency Control (1997), Safe Motherhood (1998), and Early Childhood Development (1999)\nprojects focused on vulnerable groups, women, and children. The Fifth Health Project (1999) aims\nat  improving  health  personnel  management  and  utilization,  health  staff  training,  and  quality\nassurance.", "12\n39.  The most recent World Bank project, approved in June 2000, the Provincial Health Project\n(PHP),  is  particularly  relevant  for  the  Project.  PHP  covers  two  provinces:  Lampung  and\nYogyakarta. PHP processing started in 1997 but was interrupted by the economic crisis. The\noriginal approach was to improve health services in the project provinces, emphasizing the role\nof the provincial governments, but when the decentralization laws were approved in April 1999,\nPHP was restructured to take the new social and political context into consideration. ADB\ncoordinated closely with the PHP team since PHP  and the  Project  have  a  broadly  similar\napproach: an initial period of local capacity building with locally developed sector investment\nplans confirmed at the end of the capacity building period, and an investment phase. The main\ndifference is that the Project emphasizes the districts while PHP relies more on provincial\ncoordination and management.\n40.  Since 1985, ADB has financed five loan projects in the health and population sector\n(Appendix  3).  The  Health  and  Population  Project20  and  the  Second  Health  and  Population\nProject21 aimed to strengthen delivery of health care and clinical family planning services by\nexpanding  and  upgrading  physical  infrastructure  (hospitals  and  training  facilities).  The  Rural\nHealth  and  Population  Project22  aims  to  upgrade  rural  health  services  in  the  district,  and\nstrengthen the referral system from the health center to the district hospital in selected provinces\nin Sumatra by improving the rural health and family planning delivery system. The Rural Health\nand Population Project supported capacity building, refined the integrated health planning and\nbudgeting system, and promoted the development of financially autonomous hospitals and health\ncenters in the project districts. The Family Health and Nutrition Project23 focuses on expanding the\nparticipation of families and communities in identifying their health needs and priorities, and\nincreasing service quality by helping local health staff to improve their skills and adopt a client-\noriented approach. The project focuses on poor families in less developed villages. The Intensified\nCommunicable Disease Control Project24 aims to improve control of infectious diseases (malaria,\ntuberculosis, respiratory infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases) that particularly affect the\npoor through strengthened program management at district and provincial levels. Two advisory\nTAs25 provided useful background information on resource mobilization and reorganization of\nMOHSW and the health system.\n41.  In  1998  and  1999,  ADB  approved  two  sector  development  programs,  SPSDP  and\nHNSDP, to address emergency issues arising from the economic crisis. Their objective was to\nmitigate the effects of the economic crisis on the poor. The specific objectives of SPSDP,\ncovering health and education and initially limited to eight provinces, were to (i) protect access\nby vulnerable groups to essential social services; (ii) maintain the quality of social services to\nthe  poor;  and  (iii)  initiate  sustainable  policy  reforms  related  to  the  provision  of  key  social\nservices. The objectives of HNSDP were similar, but focused on the health sector and extended\n                                                \n20Loan 743-INO: Health and Population Project, for $41.6 million, approved on 17 October 1985; closed on 30 June\n1993.\n21Loan 926-INO: Second Health and Population Project, for $39.3 million, approved on 29 November 1988; closed\non 31 March 1995.\n22Loan 1299-INO: Rural Health and Population Project, for $40 million, approved on 26 May 1994; expected to close\n31 December 2000.\n23 Loan 1471-INO: Family Health and Nutrition Project, for $45 million, approved on 27 September 1996; due to be\ncompleted on 31 March 2002.\n24 Loan 1523-INO: Intensified Communicable Diseases Control Project, for $87.4 million, approved on 19 June 1997;\ndue to be completed on 31 December 2003.\n25 TA 2221-INO: Resource Mobilization and Budgeting for Decentralized Health Services, for $600,000, approved on\n5 December 1994; and completed in September 1996. TA 2814-INO: Capacity Building of Ministry of Health for\nStrategic Planning, for $800,000, approved on 19 June 1997; completed in March 1999.", "13\nproject coverage to all provinces: to (i) protect access of vulnerable groups to essential health,\nnutrition, and family planning services; (ii) maintain the quality of services to the poor; and (iii)\ninitiate feasible and implementable policy reforms related to sustainable health and nutrition\nservice delivery. The policy priorities under the two loans provided a framework for policy\ndialogue during project preparation.\n42.  JPS-BK was set up to address the need to protect access of the poor to essential\nservices.  However,  the  two  loans  developed  before  the  enactment  of  the  laws  on\ndecentralization, strongly emphasized the need to decentralize health services and increase\nlocal participation and transparency. The loans (i) developed new disbursement mechanisms\n(through block grants directly to the beneficiaries) conceptually similar to the block allocations to\nthe districts prescribed by the laws; (ii) started a capacity-building program in the provinces and,\nin particular, helped implement the utilization of integrated health planning and budgeting (IHPB)\nin all districts; (iii) supported training related to IHPB, and (iv) developed participation of the\ncommunity and NGOs in implementing and monitoring activities.\n43.  Because  the  potential  problems  of  decentralization  of  health  services  are  of  major\nconcern, all aid agencies involved in the health sector are participating in efforts to strengthen\nlocal  capacity  and  assist  local  governments  to  identify  needs,  develop  and  implement\nappropriate reforms, and make adequate and cost-efficient investments. Some agencies are\nsupporting specific provinces and districts, others are involved at the national level, assisting\nMOHSW in policy and administrative issues. The programs of the UN agencies (WHO, UNFPA,\nUNICEF)  have  been  reoriented  to  answer  the  immediate  needs  of  decentralization.  The\nGovernment  of  the  Netherlands  has  committed  $120.0  million  grant  for  the  health  sector,\nchanneled through WHO. German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is involved in strengthening the\nhealth system in the districts of West Nusa Tenggara Province. JBIC is supporting pilot projects\nand procurement of medical equipment in selected districts of Sulawesi. In August 2000, the\nGovernment  of  Australia  fielded  a  prefeasibility  study  mission  to  examine  how  to  more\nsystematically  support  decentralization  in  the  health  sector.  AusAID  and  ADB  have  been\ncollaborating closely during preparation of this Project.\n44.  Coordination among aid agencies strongly developed during the economic crisis, and is\nmaintained to assist MOHSW better address policy issues and reforms, particularly issues\nrelated to decentralization. Several mechanisms facilitate coordination. ADB, WHO, the World\nBank, USAID, and AusAID are meeting regularly since November 1999 as a group called\nPartners in Health. Other aid agencies are welcome to participate. A ministerial decree of the\nminister of health created in early 2000 a policy advisory group directly reporting to the minister.\nThe group includes senior advisers to the ministers and representatives from ADB, the World\nBank, WHO, and JPIEGO.26 Agency coordination is also maintained through regular meetings\non health and safe motherhood, initiated by WHO, and hosted by each aid agency in turn. The\nProject itself has been developed in coordination with the World Bank team who worked on\nPHP. Close collaboration was established with the Government of Australia (AusAID), and other\nsources (WHO, GTZ) were actively consulted.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n45.  Many lessons were derived from SPSDP and HNSDP. Close partnership and policy\ndialogue with the Government ensured trustful relations that facilitated and accelerated project\n                                                \n26 Originally the Johns Hopkins University Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics,\nJHPIEGO now has a broader reproductive health agenda, not limited to gynecology and obstetrics.", "14\ndesign and implementation. The demand for targeting of Government resources imposed a\nstrict definition of the beneficiaries and quantitative targets. New disbursement mechanisms\nwere implemented; they proved efficient and accelerated disbursement Finally, implementation\nof an independent monitoring system based on the community and using NGOs was very useful\nin increasing confidence among the beneficiaries. This parallel monitoring, however, may not be\nsustainable without external support.\n46.  The  previous  ADB  projects,  completed  and  still  under  implementation,  also  yielded\nuseful lessons that were utilized in processing the Project. Most important is the need for a\nsense of project ownership by the end-users, and for bottom-up planning. Project processing\nhas been a gradual process as ADB and MOHSW gave the districts and the provinces time to\nidentify their needs by themselves and to develop their own proposals. International consultants\nwere used for general support and broad sector analysis, but local staff developed the regional\nproposals,  with  limited  support  from  domestic  consultants.  Another  lesson  is  the  need  for\nflexibility in project implementation. The main recommendations of the World Bank team for\nPHP were to fully involve the districts or provinces and let them identify their needs and\npriorities, and to ensure flexibility in the project design. The Project\u2019s main characteristic is its\nprocess-oriented  approach  and  flexibility  to  better  answer  local  needs.  Communication\n(telephone, fax, e-mail, etc.) is very important to address logistical issues quickly, but also to\nshare  experiences  and  provide  peer  technical  support.  The  Project  has  initiated  a\ncommunication network among the districts, provinces, MOHSW, and ADB, using the Internet,\nand has supported creation of a web site focusing on decentralization issues in the health\nsector.\n47.  Lessons from postevaluated projects clearly indicate the need for sustained efforts.\nBecause of the long program cycle needed for sustained development in the health sector, a\nseries of overlapping projects with consistent core objectives is necessary to make an impact on\nkey indicators while strengthening government capacity to manage the health sector. This\nProject should be considered the first of a series of decentralized capacity building in the project\narea. Subsequent projects should build on the experience of this Project.\nE.  ADB Sector Strategy\n48.  ADB\u2019s overall approach to the health sector is to assist governments of developing\nmember  countries  (DMCs)  in  assuring  their  citizens  of  broad  access  to  basic  preventive,\npromotive,  and  curative  services  that  are  efficacious,  cost-effective,  and  affordable.  ADB\u2019s\npolicy for the health sector27 highlights the need to address key issues: (i) health of the poor,\nwomen, and indigenous people; (ii) setting clear priorities to ensure the most efficient use of\nresources;  (iii)  mobilizing  resources  for  the  public  health  sector;  (iv)  building  managerial\ncapacity; (v) testing innovative approaches; (vi) introducing effective new technologies; (vii)\nfocusing on functions that constitute public good; and (viii) encouraging collaboration between\npublic and private health  service providers.\n49.  The Country Operational Strategy (COS) for Indonesia28 identifies the health sector as\none of the key sectors on which ADB will focus its capacity building support for decentralization.\nHealth must remain at the top of the agenda for local governments and communities. If the\nhealth sector is neglected, the poor and the vulnerable groups will be the first and main victims\nof deteriorating public health services, with long-lasting impact on their health status and their\n                                                \n27 Policy for the Health Sector  (February 1999).\n28 The COS, currently under preparation, is scheduled for Board consideration in January 2001.", "15\nphysical and intellectual capacity. This conclusion is also valid for family planning and nutrition\nservices. The rapid implementation of decentralization prevents systematic and progressive\nbuilding of the capacity of and technical skills of local health staff. However, decentralization\nalso offers opportunities to better adapt local health services to local needs and to ensure true\ncommunity participation in maintaining and improving health status.\n50.  The immediate issue for the health sector in Indonesia is to protect access to essential\nhealth services by the poor and vulnerable groups, and to build a nationwide health safety net\nprogram incorporating the proven elements of the JPS-BK program. JPS-BK must be improved\nto ensure better targeting of limited public resources, mobilization of other resources for health,\nand  improved  cost-efficiency  of  the  health  service  delivery  system.  Nutrition,  reproductive\nhealth, and communicable disease control will remain essential components as the poor and\nvulnerable groups (women, children) will be the first beneficiaries. While the need to maintain\nand improve physical infrastructure and equipment there will remain, the major issues to be\naddressed now are to locally adapt health services and introduce required reforms in health\ncare financing, public-private sector partnership, staff management, etc. Skill building, both in\nclinical expertise and management (including evaluation and planning), is and will remain a\npriority.\n51.  Consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  health  sector  strategy,  investment  in  primary  health  care\n(including family planning, reproductive health, and nutrition) is another priority. Health sector\nreforms to improve efficiency and effectiveness will be essential, including better targeting of\npublic resources, resources mobilization for health, public-private partnership, health services\nfinancing, staff management (incentives, career, training, etc.). Projects must also answer the\nneeds identified by the local communities and local governments.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n52.  From early support to expand physical infrastructure, ADB has progressed to emphasize\nhealth system reform and improved efficiency and effectiveness in health services delivery. ADB\u2019s\nhealth sector strategy, focusing on primary health care, provides a clear framework for policy\ndialogue and long-term investment. During the 1990s, ADB dialogue and support shifted to health\nservices organization and management, and health staff development. The referral system and\nthe links between the health centers and the district hospital were strengthened under the Rural\nHealth and Population Project (footnote 22). ADB has promoted delegation of functions and\nresponsibility to districts and provinces under the Intensified Communicable Diseases Control\nProject  (footnote  24),  as  an  initial  step  toward  decentralization.  ADB  supported  better\ncoordination between the various services and programs, and insisted on increased participation of\nthe beneficiaries. With the Family Health and Nutrition Project (footnote 23), families and the\ncommunities were targeted as beneficiaries and active participants. In reproductive health and\nfamily planning, ADB\u2019s policy has been to work together with BKKBN and MOHSW to ensure\nintegration of family planning and reproductive health in the health services.\n53.  During the crisis, ADB supported the Government\u2019s efforts to rapidly develop a safety net\nand protect access to and availability of essential services for the population, especially the poor.\nDialogue among ADB, the Government, MOHSW, and BKKBN was particularly intensive and\nfruitful during the preparation and implementation of SPSDP and HNSDP policy matrices. The\nsector development programs (SDPs) focused on six aspects of the health system: (i) access of\nvulnerable groups to essential health services; (ii) mobilization of additional resources to support\nhealth, nutrition, and family planning services; (iii) quality of health services; (iv) decentralization,\ncommunity participation, and transparency; (v) MOHSW and health system organizational changes", "16\nand development; and (vi) improving efficiency of resource use. The SPSDP and HNSDP policy\nmatrices helped protect the health budget and reorient resources to primary health care and\nservices most used by the poor and vulnerable groups. Delegation of tasks and accountability to\ndistricts and provinces proved useful in preparing for decentralization. New transfer mechanisms\nwere developed to facilitate use of funds directly by the beneficiaries. In parallel, a monitoring\nsystem developed in collaboration with the Government and other aid agencies showed how\ninvolvement of the community and civil society can improve transparency and accountability, and\nincrease efficiency. All these issues remain priorities in the present context, and the SDPs\u2019 policy\nrecommendations  have  been  further  developed  and  refined  through  project  processing\ndiscussions.\n54.  The evolution of ADB policy dialogue and linkages with the Project are summarized in\nAppendix 4. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue emphasizes access and service delivery, focusing on the\nneeds of the poor and vulnerable groups. ADB project coverage has focused on poor areas,\nand investments have focused on primary health care services and public health issues. The\nprimary objectives of SPSDP and HNSDP were to protect access to essential health services\nfor the poor and vulnerable groups. During implementation of the SDPs, regular reports were\nsubmitted by NGOs on access and delivery of health care services to the poor.29 Identifying the\nreal poor is an essential feature of the safety net program. The updated information was very\nuseful during project preparation. Moreover, actual implementation of these activities in the field\nhas modified the attitudes and priorities of local authorities and local health staff.\n55.  With the implementation of decentralization, policy dialogue takes a new turn. Relations\nhave long been established between ADB and MOHSW and BKKBN in the health sector, but\ndecentralization  requires  ADB  to  dialogue  more  directly  with  district  and  province\nrepresentatives.  Visiting  districts  and  provinces,  and  establishing  new  contacts  are  time-\nconsuming, and project processing and administration will have to take this aspect into account.\nHowever,  the  benefits  of  more  direct  dialogue  with  beneficiaries  and  their  immediate\nrepresentatives are potentially significant. Dialogue on the need for reform and collaboration\nwith private not-for-profit health organizations is easier with direct reference to the local situation\nthan in the abstract. Introducing a health insurance system with specific measures to protect the\npoor and target public resources to the poor is easier to discuss with decision makers when they\nrealize that the scheme will be adapted to the local context and not imposed for the whole\ncountry by Jakarta. This important policy dialogue at the district and province level, however, is\njust  starting  and  may  take  some  time  to  yield  all  the  potential  benefits.  This  aspect  was\nconsidered in designing the Project.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n56.  The poor and the vulnerable groups, women in particular, are most affected when\nessential public health services are not provided satisfactorily. Because the public health sector\nis the main health service provider in many rural areas, any disruption in public health services\ndelivery will seriously affect the local population. While better-off families may find alternative\nhealth service providers in the private sector, the poor and the vulnerable groups are most at\n                                                \n29 These activities have been financed through TA 3175-INO: Monitoring and Evaluating the Health and Nutrition\nSector Development Program, for $1 million, approved on 25 March 1999; attached to HNSDP. TA 3041:\nMonitoring and Evaluating the Social Protection Sector Development Program, for $2.5 million, approved on 9 July\n1998; attached to SPSDP, has concentrated on the education sector.", "17\nrisk.  With  the  start  of  decentralization  on  1  January  2001,  maintaining  functioning  and\naccessible essential services is a Government priority.\n57.  It is essential to continue policy dialogue with local authorities and provide necessary\ntechnical support to help maintain protection of the poor and their access to quality health\nservices. With decentralization, decisions will be made at the district level, by the DPRD and the\nbupati, based on advice and report from local staff and, hopefully, with participation of the\npopulation. The district authorities, the health staff who advise them, and the community and its\nrepresentatives have not been adequately prepared for taking these responsibilities. They need\nto  acquire  the  necessary  understanding  and  skills  to  make  appropriate  choices.  The\nresponsibility  of  the  district  governments  and  local  health  staff  is  no  longer  limited  to\nimplementing  policy  and  enforcing  regulations,  but  now  requires  effective  health  service\nmanagement. Both policy and management require specific information and skills that were not\nnecessary for local authorities when the system was centrally managed, but have become\ncrucial with decentralization.\n58.  Allocation of public resources by district authorities is one of the most important tools\nthat ensure real power to local governments. Health and family planning must remain among\nthe priorities of district governments. And within the health sector, protecting access to health\nservices for the poor and vulnerable groups must take precedence in resource allocation:\nresources have to be targeted to the poor rather than spread in the system. This must be\njustified and explained to decision makers at the local level. There is also a need to develop the\ntechnical  skills  necessary  for  efficient  and  cost-effective  allocation  of  available  resources.\nDecentralization offers great opportunities to identify and better address local needs in health\nand family planning, to more effectively target resources to the real poor and vulnerable groups\nin  the  community,  and  to  introduce  locally  suitable  reforms  in  the  system.  But  these\nopportunities can only be taken and can benefit the local populations if local capacity to collect\nand analyze information locally is strengthened.\n59.  The Indonesian health system must also improve its performance as reflected in health\nindicators. Indonesia\u2019s poor performances compared with that of neighboring countries, and the\ndifferences between provinces and districts indicate that major improvements are possible.\nThese changes can be expected with appropriate health sector reforms and investments in the\nphysical infrastructure, equipment, and human resources.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n60.  The project goal is to improve the health status of the population in all districts of the\nproject area by improving access, delivery and quality of health and family planning services,\nwith special attention to the poor and vulnerable groups. In the context of decentralization, the\nobjectives are to (i) strengthen local capacity in health services delivery, including planning and\nmanagement; and (ii) improve quality, cost-efficiency, and sustainability of health and family\nplanning services in the project area.\n61.  To improve health and family planning services, the Project will take the opportunity\noffered by decentralization to better involve representatives of the local communities, including\nthe poor, women, and vulnerable groups. They will participate in deciding and implementing\nappropriate managerial and organizational changes and in prioritizing investment in the local\nhealth and family planning sector based on their own assessment, with the technical support of\nhealth and BKKBN staff. By emphasizing the need for better targeting of public resources to", "18\nvulnerable groups and wide consultation in decision making, the Project will help strengthen\nequity and develop consumer choice.\n62.  The Project will cover all districts (50) and cities (12) in seven provinces: Aceh, Bali,\nBengkulu, Riau, Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi.30 All districts will\nparticipate in the Project to facilitate coordination and effectively address health issues that\nextend beyond the district boundary. For this reason, only provinces with a limited number of\ndistricts were selected for the Project. The main criterion for selection was a clear commitment\nfrom the district and provincial government to seriously address health sector issues.\n63.  The project provinces and districts are diverse in sociocultural traditions, geography, and\nresource base. Aceh is a conservative province. Women's participation rate in the labor force is\nlow, and fertility rate is high. Ethnically distinct indigenous people live in the central highlands.\nWith decentralization, revenues from natural gas should provide good resources to the local\ngovernments. Bali enjoys significant revenue from tourism. With decentralization, tourism tax\nrevenues will not be shared with the other regions. There is scope for private for-profit health\nservices, but not in all districts. Paradoxically, local governments in Bali may have problems in\nadequately  addressing  health  and  environmental  problems  (such  as  water  supply  and\nsanitation), especially in poor communities away from the tourist areas. Bengkulu, an isolated\nprovince with limited resource tax base, was severely hit by an earthquake in June 2000. Riau\nhas a rich tax base from oil fields on the mainland and a dynamic industrial zone on Batam\nIsland off Singapore. But the province also has large areas of peat swamp characterized by low\nfertility and difficult access, and small isolated islands in the Riau archipelago between the\nisland of Sumatra, Singapore, and Kalimantan. Indigenous people are found in the mountainous\nhighlands  along  the  central  Sumatra  mountain  range  and  in  the  Riau  archipelago.  North\nSulawesi has an active private not-for-profit health sector. While some parts of the province\nhave relatively prosperous communities, others are very poor. Central Sulawesi has a limited\ntax base and small, scattered communities along the narrow coastal strips and in the highland\nareas. It is the most ethnically and linguistically complex province after Irian Jaya. Southeast\nSulawesi comprises a mix of old communities and new settlements. The province is a receiving\narea of the overflow from land-short and historically disaster-prone South Sulawesi, and recently\nsaw a significant increase of internally displaced persons from Maluku.\n64.  The project area is diverse in the resource base available to local governments for\nproviding services, types of communities, and existing infrastructure. It will provide a range of\nmodels  for  resource-rich  and  resource-poor  local  governments  to  address  the  needs  of\nrelatively poor and nonpoor communities. All project provinces are covered by SPSDP and\nHNSDP (footnote 18). Aceh and Riau have participated in the Rural Health and Population\nProject (footnote 22), and Bengkulu is included in the Family Health and Nutrition Project\n(footnote 23).\n1.  Project Components\n65.  The Project will consist of four components: (i) advocacy and capacity building, (ii) health\nsector  reforms;  (iii)  investments  in  health  and  family  planning  services;  and  (iv)  project\nmanagement, including implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.\n                                                \n30 Other provinces are or will be covered by other aid agencies, particularly the World Bank, GTZ, WHO, and AusAid.", "19\na.  Advocacy and Capacity Building\n66.  Initial project activities will include advocacy and information campaigns to local decision\nmakers (bupatis and governors), the community, professional staff from other sectors, and\nhealth  staff,  on  decentralization  of  health  services,  social  impact,  gender  and  health,  and\nparticipatory governance. Capacity building will start immediately to answer an urgent need.\nCapable and skilled professionals constitute the indispensable foundation in developing and\nmaintaining  an  efficient  and  equitable  health  system.  Capacity  building  will  include  formal\ntraining, workshops, and study tours. The training program, intensive during the first year, will\ncover management and good governance: data analysis to identify local needs; prioritization\nand targeting; participatory planning; budgeting, accountability, and transparency; social and\nenvironmental  impact  assessments;  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Training  activities  will\ncontinue throughout project implementation. Medical and technical skills will be upgraded.\n67.  With  the  use  of  available  information,  field  visits,  and  analysis  of  the  preliminary\nproposals submitted by districts, a two-part training program has been developed. To address\ncommon needs, a standard training program has been prepared for all Project areas (Appendix\n5). Funds will also be allocated for other training activities based on needs identified locally that\nmay vary among districts and provinces. Training participants will include health staff and other\ncivil servants, and representatives of the private sector and civil society as appropriate. For all\ntraining activities, female candidates will be given priority with a view of achieving the target of\n50 percent of female participation in each category of training activities. Study tours, short\ncourses, and academic studies will be subject to approval by ADB.\n68.  As much as possible, training will be provided on site. Trainers will be selected from\namong MOHSW and BKKBN staff, the private sector and NGOs, professional organizations and\nteaching institutions, consultants and other stakeholders. Training activities will be competency\nbased, relying on experience and case study, and using quality information, education, and\ncommunication material. The Project will help developing collaboration among local universities\nand teaching institutions with expertise in public health. Investment in information technology\n(Internet  connections  and  distance  learning/support)  will  establish  a  network  facilitating\nexchange of information and experiences.\n69.  The  Project  will  support  operation  research  studies  that  will  cover  performance\nmonitoring and evaluation, health service organization, human resource management, impact of\ndecentralization, health information system, and development of an information network system\namong regions. These studies will be proposed by the districts, provinces, or at central level,\nconsolidated by MOHSW and submitted to ADB for approval. The findings will be reviewed by\nthe districts, provinces, and the central level and taken into consideration in preparing and\nimplementing  local  health  sector  reforms.  Domestic  firms  or  academic  institutions  will  be\nrecruited for operational research studies.\nb.  Adapting Health Services to Local Needs\n70.  Initially the Project will support consulting services for local health sector analysis and\nidentification of locally suitable reforms of the health system, based on national guidelines.\nVarious aspects of the health system will be reviewed: the particular needs of the poor and\nvulnerable groups, health care financing, better targeting of public resources, streamlining of\nstaff and staff development, role of the private sector (for-profit and not for-profit), and public-\nprivate partnership. The existing data collection system and reporting requirements, developed\nto answer the needs of a highly centralized system, will need to be adapted to assist the district", "20\nauthorities and health staff. Subsequently, the Project will support the implementation of locally\nidentified priority reforms.\n71.  Priority will be given to addressing the needs of the poor and the vulnerable groups,\nparticularly in designing mechanisms to sustain an efficient health safety net program. The\nProject will help local authorities transform JPS-BK into a sustainable program, maintaining its\nbenefits and addressing issues observed during program implementation. Public resources for\nhealth must initially be maintained at least at the existing levels, but local governments need to\nfind ways of mobilizing new resources in accordance with the national policy.\nc.  Investment in Health and Family Planning\n72.  Significant  progress  in  health  and  nutrition  status  can  be  achieved  rapidly  with\nappropriate  investments  in  health  facilities,  equipment,  and  personnel  to  increase  service\nquality. The Project will help restore an effective and efficient health services delivery system\nthrough judicious and cost-efficient investments in health and family planning services, based\non local needs. The Project will finance clinical and managerial training, consulting services, civil\nworks, equipment and material, and operational research.\n73.  Participating districts and provinces developed preliminary proposals for civil works and\nequipment for health centers, district hospitals, and local training centers. The proposals, with\ntechnical inputs and costing from MOHSW, served as the basis for the Project cost estimates\nand the indicative procurement packages to be financed by the Project.\nd.  Project Management\n74.  The project focus is on developing local capacity at the district and province levels to\nprepare  and  implement  health  sector  development  plans  and  to  manage  health  services\ndelivery. It is necessary for the district and provincial health offices to be directly involved in, and\nresponsible  for,  project  implementation  to  the  extent  possible.  Realistically,  however,  the\ndistricts  and  provinces  will  require  substantial  strengthening  and  support  before  they  can\ndischarge these tasks effectively. Because of a relatively weak local capacity and lack of\nexperience in decision making and project management, strong support is needed for project\nmanagement.\n75.  Funds will be allocated to support implementation at the district, provincial, and central\nlevels. Project funds will be used to finance the services of project management staff recruited\nunder contract where needed. Individual domestic and international consultants and domestic\nconsulting firms will provide technical support. Regular and intensive supervision and contacts\nbetween districts, provinces, and the central level will be important to prevent mistakes that are\nlikely to happen with inexperienced staff. The Project will also support independent auditing, and\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  using  technical  expertise  of  health  professionals  and  active\nparticipation  of  civil  society.  Lessons  and  experience  from  the  JPS-BK  program  will  be\nreviewed, and independent monitoring system developed under HNSDP will be adapted as\nappropriate.\n2.  Project Implementation Strategy\n76.  To achieve its objectives, the Project will be implemented in a phased manner over five\nyears. During the first phase, the Project will build community support for health and family\nplanning  in  the  districts  through  advocacy  and  information  campaigns,  and  will  strengthen", "21\ntechnical skills of health staff to identify local needs and to prepare comprehensive sector\ndevelopment plans incorporating appropriate investments and reforms. In the second phase, the\nProject will finance investments in health and family planning, and support implementation of\nlocally adapted health sector reforms based on the approved sector development plans. The\nreadiness of the districts to assume full responsibility for plan preparation and implementation\nvaries, and the duration of the first and second phases will vary accordingly. Districts that have\nparticipated in earlier ADB-funded projects (e.g., districts in Aceh) have already developed basic\ncapacities in planning and analysis and are likely to complete acceptable sector development\nplans  relatively  quickly.  Similarly,  districts  that  have  well-defined  needs  or  priorities  (e.g.,\ndistricts in Bengkulu that give priority to rehabilitation of earthquake-damaged infrastructure)\nshould be able to prepare plans within a few weeks or months. Other districts will require\nsubstantially longer to develop staff capacities before embarking on plan preparation.\n77.  During project processing, districts and provinces were required to review and adapt the\ndraft project framework to the local situation, identifying the needs for both reforms in health\nservices organization and possible investments. Each district was allocated an indicative share\nof the project resources on the basis of total population and number of the poor. With the\ntechnical support of the provincial health planning bureau, the districts prepared preliminary\nproposals that were consolidated by the provincial health office. These proposals, reviewed by\nMOHSW and BKKBN, were used for estimating project costs.\n78.  After improving their technical skills through first-phase training activities, the district\nauthorities will revise and finalize the proposals in consultation with the community. MOHSW\nand  BKKBN  will  provide  technical  support  through  in-house  expertise,  consultants,  and\noperational research. Each district will prepare a sector development plan including proposals\nfor (i) implementing locally appropriate health sector reforms,31 and (ii) physical investments.\nThe district proposals, accompanied by comments of representatives of the local community\nand local experts, will be discussed among districts at a meeting convened by the provincial\nhealth office to identify complementary activities, ensure coordination at the level technically\nnecessary to improve effectiveness and efficiency of investment or reforms in the health sector,\nand avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication. The district proposals consolidated by province\nwill be sent to ADB, MOHSW and BKKBN for review.\n79.  Proposals must be accompanied by a social impact assessment, a description of a local\nperformance  monitoring  system  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  implementation,  and  a\ncommitment  of  the  concerned  bupati  to  finance  project  activities  and  allocate  necessary\ncounterpart funds (Appendix 6). An initial environmental examination (IEE) based on ADB\u2019s\nguidelines  and  including  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  will  also  be\nattached. Proposals meeting the following basic criteria will be approved by ADB:\n(i)  Health and family planning needs of the local poor and vulnerable groups have\nbeen identified and addressed.\n(ii)  The proposal contains a description of locally appropriate mechanisms to ensure\nthe continuation of a health safety net program.\n(iii)  The proposal has been developed in a participatory process, and discussed with\nrepresentatives  of  the  local  community,  NGOs,  women\u2019s  organizations  and\nrelevant government agencies.\n                                                \n31 Local health sector reforms will include human resources management, public-private partnership, health care\nfinancing and resource mobilization, quality assurance, licensing and accreditation, etc.", "22\n(iv)  The  proposal  is  technically,  economically,  and  environmentally  sound;  and\nappropriate, effective, and cost-efficient.\n(v)  The proposal is in line with the national priorities and the national health policy.\n80.  During the second phase, districts and provinces will review project implementation\nevery year and revise, if appropriate, the activities for the following year. District progress\nreports will be consolidated at the provincial level and sent to MOHSW, BKKBN, and ADB.\nDistrict progress reports will also be made available to members of the DPRD when they will\nneed to approve counterpart funds for project activities.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n81.  The total cost of the Project, including taxes and contingencies, is estimated at $87.0\nmillion equivalent, to cover $36.7 million in foreign exchange costs (42 percent), including\ninterest and other charges during construction, and $50.3 million equivalent in local currency\ncosts (58 percent).

Although  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  recovery  continues,  the  economic  situation  remains\ndifficult. Public debt increased to 93 percent of GDP, and the Government\u2019s fiscal situation is", "23\nexpected to remain unfavorable over the medium term. In view of these difficulties and fiscal\nconstraints in the short to medium term, the Government has requested that ADB\u2019s share of\nproject financing be increased from 60 percent to 80 percent as an interim measure. Given the\ndifficult situation, it is proposed that ADB finance 80 percent of the project costs during the first\nthree years of project implementation and revert to 60 percent in the fourth year. Relaxation of\nADB\u2019s  cost-sharing  limit  for  project  financing  will  support  Indonesia\u2019s  incipient  economic\nrecovery, and is consistent with the graduation policy32 that provides for cost-sharing higher than\nthe country\u2019s limit under exceptional circumstances and where justified on country and project\nconsiderations. The World Bank currently provides 75 percent of project costs on a three-year\nrolling average, and is understood to be considering a further increase in its share. JBIC\ncurrently provides about 85 percent of project costs.\n83.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan to the Republic of Indonesia in the amount of\n$65.0 million equivalent (74.7 percent of the total project cost) from its Special Funds resources\nto finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $36.7 million and part of the local currency cost\namounting to $28.3 million equivalent. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1 percent per year during the grace period, and 1.5\npercent per year during the remaining term. The Government will finance the remaining costs of\nthe Project ($21.8 million). The financing plan is summarized in Table 3.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n   ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Currency Total Cost Percent\nExchange\nAsian Development Bank 36.7 28.3 65.0 74.7\nGovernment - 22.0 22.0 25.3\nTotal 36.7 50.3 87.0 100.0\n84.  The capacity building and nonrevenue-generating nature of the Project and its positive\nimpact on the poor and vulnerable groups justify the provision of Special Funds resources. The\nProject will strengthen the capacity of regional governments for sustainable management of health\nservices and give invaluable support to the Government\u2019s efforts for decentralization.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Implementation and Coordination\n85.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be MOHSW, supported by BKKBN for the\nfamily planning and family welfare activities of the Project. The project organization is given in\nAppendix 8.\n86.  District Level. In each district, the bupati will establish a district health committee\n(DHC).  The  DHC  will  comprise  representatives  of  district  development  planning  agency\n(BAPPEDA),  district  health  services,  BKKBN,  private  health  sector,  community  leaders,\nwomen\u2019s groups, and local NGOs. The bupati or the head of the district BAPPEDA will be the\ndistrict project director (DPD). The head of the district health services will be the district project\nmanager (DPM) assisted by a district implementation unit (DIU). Under the guidance of the DHC\n                                                \n32 R204-98: A Graduation Policy for the Bank\u2019s DMCs, 23 November 1998", "24\nand DPD, the DPM will be responsible for preparing the district action plan for the following\nyears.  In  addition,  the  DPM  will  supervise  local  project  implementation  (procurement,\ndisbursement,  and  accounting  for  district-level  activities  in  conformity  with  the  proposals\napproved by ADB).\n87.  Provincial Level. The head of the provincial BAPPEDA will be the provincial project\ndirector (PPD). The head of the provincial health services will be the provincial project manager\n(PPM) assisted by a provincial project coordination and implementation unit (PCIU) that will\ncoordinate project implementation in the province and provide technical support to districts\nwhen  required. A  provincial  technical  review  team  (TRT)  will  review  district  and  province\nproposals and annual reports. The head of the planning unit of the provincial health services will\nchair  the  TRT,  which  will  include  (i)  technical  experts  from  provincial  health  services  and\nBKKBN, the private sector, health professional organizations, local academic institutions, and\nconsultants;  and  (ii)  representatives  of  the  community,  provincial  BAPPEDA  and  NGOs.\nMOHSW and BKKBN staff from the central level will provide guidance and technical support to\nthe TRT.\n88.  Central Level. At the central level, the MOHSW secretary general will be the project\ndirector, with the principal secretary of BKKBN as deputy project director. The head of the\nMOHSW planning bureau will be the central project manager (CPM) and the head of the\ndirectorate of planning of BKKBN will be deputy central project manager (DCPM). A Central\nTechnical  Committee  (CTC)  will  give  technical  advice  to  CPM  and  DCPM  and  ensure\ncoordination and sharing of information between the project districts and provinces. A central\nsteering  committee  composed  of  senior  representatives  of  the  ministries  and  agencies\nconcerned  (i.e.,  MOHSW,  MOF,  BAPPENAS,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  State  Ministry  of\nRegional Autonomy, State Ministry for the Empowerment of Women, BKKBN) will advise the\nproject director on general policy and intersectoral coordination. A Central Project Coordinating\nUnit (CPCU), with a subunit in BKKBN, will coordinate project implementation at the central\nlevel and give necessary technical support to the PCIUs and DIUs.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n89.  The Project will be implemented in two phases over five years commencing in early\n2001 (Appendix 9). The first phase will strengthen awareness and technical capacity in health\nand  family  planning  issues.  At  the  end  of  the  first  phase,  districts  (and  provinces  when\nappropriate)  will  finalize  their  proposals  for  investment  and  local  reforms.  The  proposals\napproved by ADB will be implemented in the second phase.\n3.  Procurement\n90.  Goods and services will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The\nExecuting  Agency  has  been  advised  of  the  need  for  maintaining  transparency  and\naccountability in all project activities, as required under ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy.\n91.  Civil works and equipment procurement packages are for three groups: hospitals, health\ncenters,  and  others  (covering  health  offices,  training  centers,  laboratories,  pharmacy\nstorehouses and housing). Civil works will involve construction and rehabilitation work. As there\nare no civil work contracts valued at more than $1.0 million, local competitive bidding (LCB)\nprocedures will apply, with an exception that civil works for rehabilitating village health facilities\nor  activities  aimed  at  creating  a  healthy  environment  and  preventing  diseases  (such  as\ncommunity latrines and village drains), estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less, may", "25\ninvolve the participation of the communities and will be awarded in accordance with procedures\nto be agreed upon between the DIU and the community concerned, and acceptable to ADB.\nGoods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  by  international\ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. For goods with a total estimated value of $500,000 or\nless, international shopping (IS) procedures will apply, except for vehicles, motorcycles, and\noffice equipment where LCB procedures will apply. Procurement of hospital equipment will be\nconsolidated at the provincial level or, when possible, at the central level for better efficiency.\nProcurement of health center equipment will be consolidated at the provincial level. Items\ncosting less than $50,000 equivalent can be procured under direct purchase (DP) procedures.\nICB and IS procurement will be handled by CPCU, or by PCIU with assistance from CPCU.\nPCIU will handle LCB with assistance from CPCU. With the assistance of PCIU, DIU will handle\nLCB  for  vehicles,  motorcycles  and  office  equipment.  DIU  will  handle  DP.  The  proposed\nprocurement procedures and indicative packages are summarized in Appendix 10.\n4.  Consulting Services\n92.  Because of a relatively weak local capacity and lack of experience in decision making,\nthe Project will provide strong support for project management. Where capacity exists, districts\nand provinces will be encouraged to utilize existing offices and staff for implementation. Where\ncapacity does not exist or requires strengthening, project counterpart funds will be used to\nfinance the services of contractual project management staff at district, province, and central\nlevels. In the absence of significant contributions from current staff, five persons (278 person-\nmonths) will be engaged at central level, two persons (108 person-months) in each of the seven\nprovinces, and one person plus administrative officers (60 person-months plus lump sum) in\neach of the 62 districts and cities. The total is a maximum of 4,394 person-months (4.9 percent\nof project costs).\n93.  International and domestic consultants will provide technical support and ensure transfer\nof knowledge to counterpart staff in specific areas of expertise (Appendix 11). Part of the\nconsulting  services  to  be  provided  will  be  reserved  to  give  project  managers  flexibility  in\nengaging consultants after local needs are identified in the first phase. The Project will fund a\ntotal of about 37 person-months of international and 225 person-months of domestic technical\nconsulting  services  (excluding  project  management  staff).  Domestic  and  international\nconsultants will be engaged individually or through consulting firms.33 Local consulting firms will\nbe engaged for information technology, and environmental and social impact assessments. All\nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements acceptable to ADB for appointing domestic consultants.\n5.  Training Activities\n94.  With project support, local universities and teaching institutions with expertise in public\nhealth will develop a health system decentralization consortium. Local institutions will be linked\nwith project management staff by Internet connections whenever possible and will assist local\nhealth services staff to assess local training needs and provide continuous technical support\nduring and after implementation. Training activities in the districts and provinces are divided into\ntwo packages: a standard training package (decentralization and management) and a training\npackage  based  on  local  needs,  with  a  curriculum  developed  locally  by  the  consortium\nparticipants on request.\n                                                \n33 The decision to engage consultants individually or through a consulting firm will depend on the districts\u2019 or\nprovinces\u2019 requests, but in any case will require ADB approval.", "26\n95.  A group of local trainers will first be trained on the standard package. They will be\nselected  from  MOHSW  and  BKKBN  staff,  the  private  sector  and  private  consulting  firms,\nacademic and teaching institutions, individual experts, professional organizations, and NGOs.\nQualified NGOs in particular will be used for social training in poverty reduction, gender and\nhealth, and participatory planning and management. Trainees will not be limited to MOHSW and\nBKKBN staff, but will include representatives of NGOs and the private sector. Project managers\nwill ensure gender balance in selecting the trainees, with a view to achieving 50 percent female\nparticipation in each category of training activities.\n96.  For in-country and overseas academic training and study tours, training institutions and\nvenues will be selected, and contracts awarded following procedures acceptable to ADB and\ntaking into consideration economy and efficiency. Training beneficiaries will include at least 50\npercent female candidates.\n6.  Cost Sharing and Funds Flow\n97.  The Government will disburse the proceeds of the loan and the corresponding counterpart\ncontributions necessary for financing project activities by budgetary transfers of funds earmarked\nfor such purpose, in accordance with Laws 22/99 and 25/99 and the prevailing implementing\nregulations. The Government has ensured that loan proceeds and counterpart funds for project\nactivities will continue throughout the period of project implementation by earmarking the funds,\nnotwithstanding  (i)  any  reallocation  of  authority  or  responsibility  for  channeling  of  external\nassistance  and  provision  of  corresponding  counterpart  contributions  between  the  national\nGovernment  and  participating  districts  and  provinces;  or  (ii)  any  requirement  for  providing\nmatching counterpart contributions for funding project activities from participating districts and\nprovinces, arising from the full implementation of Laws 22/99 and 25/99.\n7.  Special Account and Statement of Expenditure\n98.  MOF will establish an imprest account in Bank Indonesia or a state bank acceptable to\nADB to make payments in local currency for project implementation. Disbursements will follow\nexisting  mechanisms  based  on  the  standard  procedure  for  loan  payment  mechanism.\nDisbursements will be through the MOF Regional Treasury Office (KPKN) and Bank Indonesia\nor state bank branches. The districts and provinces will be responsible for preparing withdrawal\napplications and documents for project activities implemented at their level. The applications\nand supporting documents will be consolidated at the provincial level and submitted to the MOF\nBudget Regional Office with copies sent directly to ADB and CPCU. For activities implemented\nby the central level (MOHSW and BKKBN), withdrawal applications and supporting documents\nwill be prepared respectively by CPCU and BKKBN CPCU subunit. MOF\u2019s Budget Regional\nOffice and CPCU will consolidate the withdrawal applications and transmit the documents to\ndirector  general  for  budget.  The  MOF  director  general  for  budget  as  the  authorized\nrepresentative will submit these withdrawal applications to ADB. ADB will replenish the imprest\naccount upon receiving the withdrawal applications consolidated by MOF. MOF has ensured\nthat the withdrawal applications will be submitted on a timely basis to ADB for replenishment of\nthe imprest account.\n99.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  be  the  estimated\nexpenditures for the first six months of project implementation, but will not exceed $2,000,000\nequivalent. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be used for expenditures not\nexceeding $50,000 per item of expenditure. All special accounts will be established, operated, and", "27\nmaintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated June 1996 and such\ndetailed arrangements as may be agreed upon by the Government and ADB.\n8.  Accounts and Audit\n100.  All project districts and provinces, MOHSW and BKKBN will maintain separate accounts\nfor all expenditures in accordance with sound accounting principles. All project special accounts,\nincluding financial statements and SOE and special account records, will be audited annually as\npart of the regular audit accounts and financial statements by auditors acceptable to ADB. The\naudit opinion on the special accounts and SOE procedures will be set out separately. The\nconsolidated annual audited accounts and financial statements, together with audit reports, in\nEnglish, will be submitted to ADB within nine months after the end of the Government's fiscal year.\nThis will be facilitated by the appointment of a full-time finance officer in CPCU. The CPCU will\nsubmit to ADB, within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, consolidated progress\nreports on the Project in a form agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The Government,\ndistricts, and provinces have been informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts. A\nformal warning will be issued if accounts are more than six months overdue, and disbursements\nwill suspended if the accounts are 12 months overdue.\n9.  Project Supervision and Reports\n101.  The Government and ADB will conduct a project review every six months after loan\neffectiveness and a midterm review upon completion of the second year of implementation, before\nSeptember 2003, to assess progress and achievements against the objectives, identify any\nproblems  encountered,  and  recommend  remedial  measures  if  required.  The  findings  of  the\nmidterm review will be discussed at provincial and central workshops to be attended by the\nprovincial  and  district  health  and  family  planning  officers  concerned,  representatives  of  the\nagencies involved in the Project, and ADB.\n102.  The Government will coordinate and cooperate with ADB in reviewing the Project and in\nthis connection, will submit to ADB documents and reports that may be required. Within three\nmonths after the loan closing date, the provinces and the Government will submit a project\ncompletion report to ADB, in such form and detail as ADB may request.\n10.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n103.  Within six months of loan effectiveness, CPCU will develop a performance monitoring\nsystem (PM) for training and capacity-building activities, and each province will develop a PM\nbased on the project framework for local activities. Technical support will be necessary to\nstrengthen local capacity and ensure that appropriate and valid baseline data are collected. This\ntechnical support will be provided from the pool of consulting services or by NGOs and through\noperational research, as necessary. As soon as possible, indicators, targets, and mechanisms\nfor collecting data will be publicized on the Internet. PM information will be regularly updated (at\nleast every quarter) under the responsibility of the PPM, and freely available on the Internet for\nreview and discussion by the public. The PCU will ensure that local NGOs are informed about\nthe PM and have access to the information. Benchmark data to be collected during the first year\nof project implementation will be necessary to support any follow-up proposal for investment or\nreforms during the second phase.\n104.  The community will actively participate in project monitoring through the DHCs. During\nthe second phase, the DHC will meet at least once a year to review project implementation and", "28\npropose any modification, if necessary, in the plan of action for the following year. Reports from\nthe DHC will be submitted to the PPM and sent to ADB, MOHSW and BKKBN.\nF.  The Executing Agency\n105.  The Executing Agency will be MOHSW. BKKBN will support MOHSW for family planning\nand family welfare activities of the Project. MOHSW and BKKBN have been executing or\nimplementing agencies for all ADB projects in the health sectors and have experience with ADB\nprocedures and regulations. However, decentralization will impose new relations between the\ncentral level and the districts and provinces. The precise functions of MOHSW and BKKBN in a\ndecentralized health system have not yet been clearly defined. The two agencies will need to\ndefine their new functions. Their role will shift from implementing agencies to policy-making\nagencies responsible for developing national health and family planning policy and guidelines,\nand developing and monitoring quality standards for health services.\n106.  The project implementation arrangements will ensure that MOHSW and BKKBN can\nshare their experience in managing ADB-supported health projects with the project districts and\nprovinces. They will play the role of coordinators and technical advisers. But the districts will\nhave the main role in, and responsibility for, implementation. For many districts, their lack of\nexperience with ADB procedures and regulation will demand strong and regular support. This\nsupport will be provided by domestic consultants, MOHSW and BKKBN, and frequent review\nmissions from ADB. The Internet connections developed under the Project will also facilitate\ncommunication with the district and province units.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n107.  The rehabilitation and construction of hospitals and health centers will require IEE,\nincluding  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans.  Other  civil  works  (e.g.,\nrehabilitation  of  existing  facilities)  will  be  undertaken  with  minimal  disturbance  to  the\nenvironment.  The  district  head  will  ensure  that  appropriate  environmental  regulations  are\nfollowed and the environmental management and monitoring plans recommended by the IEE\nare implemented. Optimal use of local materials will be promoted. Handling of refuse and disposal\nof hazardous medical waste will be specifically considered and addressed in each case.\n108.  To be considered by ADB, the proposals finalized by the districts and provinces must\nalso be accompanied by social impact assessment. The proposal must clearly indicate how the\nhealth and family planning needs of the poor and vulnerable groups were identified, what these\nneeds are, and how the proposal addresses these needs.\n109.  Districts  and  provinces  have  been  specifically  requested  to  prepare  an  alternative\nproposal to continue or replace JPS-BK, the health safety net program developed during the\ncrisis. Developing and implementing a sustainable JPS-BK exit strategy are a Government\npriority. ADB experience in JPS-BK through SPSDP and HNSDP will prove useful in supporting\nthe development of long-term sustainable and locally adapted programs by the districts and\nprovinces to ensure access to essential health services for the poor and vulnerable groups.\nBetter  identification  of  the  beneficiaries,  using  the  JPS-BK  experience,  will  permit  better\ntargeting of the public resources and reduce the number of eligible poor who do not benefit from\nthe  programs  and  of  better-off  beneficiaries  who  should  not  have  priority  for  the  public\nresources. The essential features of SPSDP and HNSDP will be emphasized: protection of the\npoor and prevention of malnutrition among infants, children under five years, pregnant women,\nand lactating mothers. SPSDP and HNSDP incentives for village midwives to actively provide", "29\ntheir services in the community will be promoted. Participation of the community and civil society\nin monitoring the use of funds will be advocated.\n110.  The participation of BKKBN in the Project reflects the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s concern\nwith reproductive health and the need to maintain access to family planning for everybody.\nFamilies have become accustomed to the opportunities offered by planning their family and\nspacing births. With family planning, women will be able to benefit from the job opportunities\noffered by a recovering economy and fully participate in the economic development of their\ncommunity.\nH.  Technical Assistance\n111.  The Project will be accompanied by technical assistance to support policy reforms in the\nhealth sector. The MOHSW will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA (Appendix 12) will\npermit the Government and the project provinces to further assess the need for national and/or\nregional health sector reforms in the new context of decentralization, and to develop and\nimplement these reforms. The TA is proposed to be financed by ADB on a grant basis from JSF,\nfunded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  application  for  financing  for  the  JSF  is  under\nconsideration by the Government of Japan.\n112.  The TA will provide 36 person-months consulting services. An individual health policy\nreform adviser, based in Jakarta, will support the MOHSW policy advisory group (para. 44) in\ncoordinating and implementing policy reforms related to decentralization. The adviser will assist\nMOHSW,  BKKBN,  and  the  districts  and  provinces  in  implementing  decentralization  and\nidentifying opportunities for and constraints to reform, and in monitoring implementation of\nhealth sector reform proposals. The consultant will ensure continuity in advisory services and\nfacilitate  exchange  of  experience  and  lessons  learned  between  the  project  districts  and\nprovinces; and coordination and linkage with activities of other aid agencies. The consultant will\nbe selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n113.  The second component of the TA will consist of resources to be allocated by MOHSW\nupon agreement to support operations research, studies, workshops, and activities related to\nhealth sector reforms. All TA financed activities will need to be approved by ADB. The research\nand study proposals will have to be prepared within two years of TA approval and completed\nwithin 30 months of TA approval.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses\n114.  Investment in public health through the Project will yield considerable economic benefits.\nLocal governments have the potential to grasp and reflect local needs, and to devise the most\nefficient delivery mechanisms to expand the outreach of public health services and minimize the\ncosts of delivery. The Project will draw out the potential economic benefits of decentralization by\nhelping the provinces and districts to maximize this potential through institutional and capacity\nbuilding, investment, and reforms.\n115.  The Project will lead to substantial cost savings through health sector reforms and\ncapacity-building activities. Merging the parallel local health offices reporting, respectively, to\ncentral MOHSW and to the local government will achieve substantial cost savings and improve\nefficiency through effective system development, optimal allocation of workforces, and human", "30\nresources development. Public-private partnerships planned as part of the reforms will improve\npublic sector efficiency through its direct exposure to market competition with private health\nservice providers. A more comprehensive and quantitative economic analysis is attached in\nSupplementary Appendix A.\n116.  Economic analysis was conducted using disability-adjusted life year (DALY)34 and gross\nregional domestic product data in each of the seven project provinces. The expected reduction\nof  the  DALY  gap  between  project  provinces  and  developed  countries,35  and  cost  savings\nexpected to result from the necessary rationalization of the workforces were considered the\nmain economic benefits of the Project. To calculate the value of the project benefits, the number\nof DALY gained was multiplied by the per capita gross provincial domestic product, and median\nage salaries of civil servants was used for staff rationalization. In each province, the value of\nprojects benefits over 10 years were compared with the costs of project activities,36 discounted\nat the rate of 12 percent. The benefit-cost ratio varies from 11.8 in Riau to 1.1 in Bengkulu, with\nan average of 4.5. Low figures for Bengkulu reflect incremental costs related to emergency\nrehabilitation of earthquake-damaged physical infrastructure (Table 4).\nTable 4: Cost-Benefit Analysis\nItem Aceh Bali Bengkulu Riau Central North Southeast\nSulawesi Sulawesi Sulawesi\nA.

Two factors are important to ensure sustainability of health service delivery: greater cost-\nefficiency  in  resource  allocation  and  increased  resources  mobilization.  A  major  benefit  of\ndecentralization is the local participation in identifying the needs and developing appropriate\nsolutions, taking into consideration local conditions. With adequate technical skills, significant\nefficiency gains in health services planning and management can be realized. Rationalizing\npersonnel and increasing public-private partnership are among the main issues that districts and\nprovinces must address, in preparing their reform proposals.\n119.  Project  investments  in  advocacy  and  capacity  building  will  be  essential  to  ensure\nsustainability.  These  activities  target  not  only  health  staff  but  also  nonhealth  stakeholders\nincluding members of the local governments. People responsible for identifying priorities and\nallocating  resources  in  the  districts  and  provinces  will  benefit  from  the  training  activities,\ntechnical support from experts, and continuous policy dialogue with ADB. This will increase\nallocation efficiency.\n120.  Primary health care37 is a very cost-effective strategy for health service delivery. The\nProject aims to guarantee quality primary health care services for the poor. Because primary\nhealth care services have large positive externalities and are most beneficial to the poor, it is\ninappropriate to insist on cost-recovery for such services.38 Cost recovery inhibits not only poor\npeople\u2019s  access  to  essential  health  services;  it  also  imposes  large  administrative  costs.\nHowever, the Project emphasizes resource mobilization for health services, and will finance\ntraining activities, technical expertise and, when appropriate, implementation of reforms that will\nhelp mobilize new resources in the districts and provinces. In particular, the development of a\nhealth insurance system or a managed care system is a priority of the Government and the\nnational health policy. Better public-private partnership also will get the private sector more\ninvolved in health care financing. Advocacy and policy dialogue, increased efficiency in resource\nallocation, and mobilization of new resources for the health sector are the main mechanisms\nthat will ensure sustainability of project investments.\nC.  Environment\n121.  The Project will finance rehabilitation of hospitals and health centers and construction of\nnew facilities justified through health development plans. The proposal submitted by the district\nand provincial governments on financing these activities must include IEE, and environmental\nmanagement  and  monitoring  plans.  The  IEE  will  focus  not  only  on  the  impacts  during\nconstruction of the health facilities but also on those during the operation (e.g., handling of\nmedical  wastes).  The  IEE  report  and  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans\napproved by the Government will be submitted to ADB before any civil works are approved.\nSome districts have proposed to address, under the Project, sanitation and environment issues\nthat have a positive impact on health. With the achievement of the objectives of the Project,\npositive environmental impacts will occur through improved sanitation.\n                                                \n37 Primary health care includes essential promotive (health education and promotion of healthy lifestyle), preventive\n(immunization and nutrition programs), and curative (basic curative services) health services.\n38 ADB. Policy for the Health Sector , February 1999.", "32\nD.  Social Dimensions\n122.  The rationale and the design of the Project explain its high social value indicated by the\ninitial poverty impact assessment (Appendix 13). The Government is the main provider of\nmodern health services for the poor, women, and children; any disruption of the public health\ncare delivery system will mainly affect these groups. While the better-off will probably be able to\nafford  the  services  of  private  providers,  the  poor  will  face  major  problems.  Focus  group\ndiscussions with women revealed their particular concern with the cessation of the JPS-BK\nactivities as the program closes at the end of 2001, and possible disruption in the availability of\nhealth care services and contraceptives. The immediate objective of the Project is to ensure\ntechnical support to the districts to maintain normal health services delivery. This support will be\nmost  necessary  during  the  difficult  initial  phase  of  decentralization,  which  explains  the\nGovernment\u2019s request for fast processing of the Project.\n123.  Districts will pay particular attention to accessibility of health services for the poor and\nwill review the JPS-BK program to ensure continuation of those elements that have shown the\ngreatest impact on the poor. Paradoxically during the crisis, access to essential services for the\npoor was protected with the establishment of JPS-BK. But this program was financed mainly by\nexternal resources. Appropriate mechanisms must be found to maintain the benefits of the\nprogram while ensuring its continuity and sustainability. Reorientation of JPS-BK is a project\npriority.\n124.  Family planning and reproductive health, of greatest concern to women, are primary\nproject components. With quality family planning accessible to everybody and especially the\npoor,  families  are  able  to  space  births  and  ensure  a  harmonious  development  of  all  the\nmembers. Women\u2019s option to control their fertility gives them greater control over their destiny.\nWomen also will benefit from all training activities. Priority will be given to women trainees with a\nview to achieve 50 percent of women trainees and fellowship candidates. This recommendation\nwill benefit women in the local community and provide them with greater opportunities for career\nadvancement.\n125.  The project districts, particularly in Riau, Central Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi, have\nsignificant numbers of indigenous groups almost entirely dependent on the public health care\nsystem. Their continued access to health care depends on the degree to which local health\nservices and decision makers give priority to the needs of the poor and vulnerable communities\nunder decentralization.\n126.  With an advocacy campaign targeting local authorities and capacity-building activities for\nhealth staff, the populations in the project area will have some guarantee that the decentralized\npublic health services will continue to function normally. Capacity building and investment in the\nhealth sector will have an immediate impact on the quality of the health services and, hopefully,\non patient satisfaction. Better quality health services will result in better health and nutrition\nstatus for the local population.\nE.  Risks and Safeguards\n127.  Although decentralization is required by law, its rapid implementation carries major risks\nof disruption of public services for these reasons: regulations are not ready or well understood,\ninstructions can be misinterpreted, and there was no time to build up local capacity. Project\nactivities will be planned and implemented by local staff with little or no experience, who are not\nused to taking initiative or accepting responsibility. The Project was designed to reduce these", "33\nrisks. The Project is process-oriented and will be implemented in two phases, emphasizing\ncapacity building in the first phase. Investment and reform proposals will be confirmed only at\nthe end of the first phase. Although preliminary investment proposals have been prepared by\nthe districts, these proposals must be reviewed and refined and submitted with appropriate\njustification for formal endorsement by the Government and ADB. This two-step approach will\nensure identification and selection of cost-efficient investments. The continuous participation of\nthe local community in preparation, implementation, and monitoring, through the DHC, will\nincrease a local sense of ownership, facilitate sustainability of activities, and guarantee that the\nProject effectively benefits the targeted beneficiaries.\n128.  Counterpart funding for project activities has been carefully discussed, but remains a risk\ndue to the prevailing economic difficulties and because Law 25/99 limits the rights of the central\nGovernment to earmark funds that will be used in the districts and the provinces. In accordance\nwith  Laws  22/99  and  25/99,  project  funds  will  be  channeled  through  SAF  /  GAF.  Project\nresources have been allocated to ensure that delay in counterpart funding will not prevent\nimplementation  of  essential  project  activities.  In  the  spirit  of  decentralization,  project\nimplementation relies mainly on the commitment of the districts. During project preparation, all\nbupatis of the project districts signed a written commitment to support activities, and all health\ndevelopment proposals submitted to ADB for project funding must attach a commitment of the\nbupati to allocate necessary counterpart funds. The Government has assured that counterpart\nfunds for the Project will be guaranteed and channeled through SAF, the only legal mechanism\nto transfer earmarked funds to the districts.\n129.  Good governance is essential. With weak administrative capacity, limited experience,\nand  still  fluid  control  and  reporting  systems,  a  major  risk  is  misallocation  and  waste  of\nresources. Transparency and accountability may be easier to implement at the local level with\nparticipation of the local community, but will also require better monitoring, down to the project\nareas. Project coverage of 62 districts and cities creates logistical issues for supervision and\nmonitoring that can be reduced by using information technology and Internet communication\nextensively.\n130.  Weak technical and managerial capacity and lack of experience may be an obstacle that\nwill reduce absorptive capacity in the districts and provinces, and delay disbursement of the\nloan proceeds. By design, the ADB loan amount will not be sufficient to cover all the needs of\nthe project provinces,39 but it will guarantee that the districts and provinces systematically\nprioritize their activities and investments, and do not waste relatively costly resources.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n131.  The  Government  have  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n                                                \n39 The total cost of the preliminary proposals prepared by the districts and the provinces amounts to about $101.0\nmillion equivalent. As the total project costs (including ADB loan and counterpart funds) amount to $87.0 million,\nthere is a gap between the needs already identified and the resources available. Therefore, choices will have to be\nmade and districts and provinces will have to prioritize their investments.", "34\n(i)  Social dimensions. The Government will ensure that the Project will be implemented in line\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations.\n(a)  The  proposals  to  be  prepared  by  the  districts  will  provide  qualitative  and\nquantitative data on the poor and the vulnerable groups living in the concerned\nadministrative  area  (including  internally  displaced  persons  and  indigenous\npeople). Criteria defining \u201cpoor and vulnerable groups\u201d will be specified.\n(b)  In selecting the participants for all training activities, priority will be given to women\nso as to achieve 50 percent female participation in each category of training\nactivities.\n(c)  The management information system (MIS) and performance monitoring system\nfor the Project will provide gender disaggregated data and information.\n(ii)  Counterpart Funds. The Government will ensure that all counterpart funds for project\nimplementation are provided in a timely manner. Hence , the Government will make timely\nsubmissions of annual budgetary appropriation requests and adopt all other measures\nnecessary  or  appropriate  for  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds  to  the\nparticipating provinces and districts during each year of implementation.\n(iii)  Earmarked  funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  the  period  of  project\nimplementation, the proceeds of the Loan and the corresponding amount of necessary\ncounterpart  funds,  shall  be  disbursed  to  project  provinces  and  project  districts,  by\nbudgetary transfers of funds earmarked for such purpose.\n(iv)  Laws 22/99 and 25/99. The Government will\n(a)  ensure that funds from the loan proceeds and the counterpart funds will continue\nthroughout project implementation by earmarking the funds, notwithstanding any\nreallocation of authority or responsibility for channeling of external assistance and\nprovision  of  corresponding  counterpart  contributions  between  the  national\nGovernment and the participating provinces and districts, or any requirements for\nmatching counterpart funds for project activities from participating provinces and\ndistricts arising from the full implementation of Laws 22/99 and 25/99, unless\notherwise agreed to by ADB.\n(b)  regularly  update  ADB  on  decentralization  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the\nprovisions of Laws 22/99 and 25/99 of 1999, and any implementing regulations\nissued thereunder, and take into account any views expressed by ADB thereon.\n(v)  Project management and counterpart staff. In all participating districts and cities, a district\nhealth  committee  (DHC),  comprising  representatives  of  the  district  health  services,\nBAPPEDA,  BKKBN,  private  sector,  community  leaders,  women\u2019s  organizations  and\nNGOs, will be established at least six months before the district concerned submits its\nproposals for ADB approval.\n(vi)  Environment. IEE and environmental management and monitoring plans will be required\nfor rehabilitating and constructing hospitals or health centers funded by the Project. The\nIEE  reports  and  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans  endorsed  by  the\nGovernment  must  be  approved  by  ADB  before  any  civil  works  are  approved.  The", "35\nGovernment and Executing Agency will ensure that the environmental management and\nmonitoring plan of each hospital will be implemented.\n(vii)  Performance monitoring system.\n(a)  The Government will ensure that within six months of loan effectiveness, a PM is\ndeveloped at the central level for training and capacity-building activities, and a PM\nfor all other project activities in each province.\n(b)  The Government will ensure that within three months of ADB\u2019s approval of the\nlocal investment proposals, the PM attached to the approved proposal will be\nimplemented at the local level.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n132.  The effectiveness of the Loan Agreement will be subject to the issuance of a decree by\nMOHSW,  or  another  relevant  authority  within  MOHSW,  establishing  a  central  project\ncoordination unit in MOHSW, to be headed by the Chief of the Bureau of Planning as Project\nManager.\nVII.

Communicable Disease Control\n11. Tuberculosis is a priority health problem, with Indonesia third on the list of high burden\ncountries  (World  Health  Organization  2000),  causing  nearly  double  the  disease  burden  of\nneighboring countries (7.7 percent compared with 4 percent). While it appears that Indonesia\ncompares favorably with other neighbors earning a per capita income of $1,000 or more, Table\nA2.9 shows the proportion of cases of tuberculosis.\nTable A2.9: Proportion of Cases of Tuberculosis (TB) per 100,000\nYear Indonesia Singapore Malaysia Thailand Japan\n1993 32.7 65.5 63.8 86.3 38.9\n1994 25.4 59.4 59.4 82.1 35.6\n1995 16.1 56.8 59.5 78 34.4\n1996 12.2 21.8 62.7 67.9 33.6\n1997 10.9 57.5 64.4 51.2 33.6\n        Source: Profil Kesehatan Indonesia Tahun 1999.\n(i)  In fact the apparent decline in TB in 1991-1996 may be related to lack of funds for\nsurveillance.\n(ii)  Role definition between MOHSW provincial office (Kanwil) (responsible when there are\ndisease outbreaks) and provincial health services (Dinas) (that assess drug needs and\ndistribute between districts) is poor and funds are not always channeled to areas of\nhighest priority needs.", "45\nAppendix 2, page 6\n(iii)  Data cannot be relied upon with regard to TB cure rates etc., based on our field visits to\nthe districts where cure rates above 90 percent were cited, with less than 5 percent\ndropouts, while TB drug supply had been interrupted for over six months.

Noncommunicable Disease\n12. The demographic transition places a double burden on the health system, with rising\nrates of noncommunicable diseases (e.g., at health centers level over 40 percent outpatient\ncases are for hypertension, asthma, etc.). Smoking is a major contributor to these diseases but\nthere is little political will to develop strategies to counter the trend (e.g., enforced no-smoking\nareas, no selling of cigarettes to minors, a portion of tobacco taxes directed to the health\nsector).\n5.  Nutrition\n 13. The issue of malnutrition needs to be further discussed. Groups at highest risk are\nchildren 5-12 months, maternal malnutrition, and anemia (for children 5-14 and women of\nreproductive  age,  over  50  percent).  Iodine  deficiency  disease  (IDD)  has  declined  overall\nbecause 80 percent of households use iodized salt. Vitamin A deficiency had been reduced until\nthe crisis disrupted the distribution program. This will need to be reestablished as part of a local\nhealth safety net program (based on service statistics, Vitamin A distribution coverage in 1998\nin descending order is Southeast Sulawesi 83 percent, Bali 69 percent, Riau 52 percent, Central\nSulawesi 47 percent, North Sulawesi 45 percent, Aceh 40 percent, Bengkulu 36.3 percent).\n                                                \n4  Draft Plan of Action National TB Program of Indonesia 2000.", "46\nAppendix 3\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\nASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA TO THE\nHEALTH, POPULATION, AND NUTRITION SECTORS\nNumber Title       Date of Amount\n      Approval ($ million)\nA.

Objective and Scope\n1. The Project will be accompanied by technical assistance (TA): Support for Health Sector\nPolicy Reforms. For several years, there has been continuing dialogue between the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Government on the need for health sector policy reform and\nassessment of reform options.1 The dialogue intensified when the economic crisis affected\nIndonesia in 1997-1998. The Ministry of Health (now the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare\n[MOHSW])  rapidly  set  up  a  social  safety  net  program  (JPS-BK)  to  protect  access  to  and\navailability of essential health services with ADB support.2 MOHSW and ADB developed policy\nmatrices that identified urgently needed reforms. The full implementation of decentralization\nstarting in 2001 demands that reforms be implemented, but also offers new opportunities.\n2. Health sector reforms are necessary to help the Indonesian health system adapt to the\nnew social, political, and economic environment. Many aspects of the health system need to be\nreviewed to assess whether they are still appropriate in the present context or whether changes\nshould be introduced to improve effectiveness and efficiency. These aspects include health\nsystem organization, role of MOHSW, quality assurance, health care financing, public-private\npartnerships, family planning program and reproductive health, staff management and, most\nimportant, how the health system can ensure that the poor and the vulnerable groups have\naccess to quality health services when needed.\n3. The objective of the TA is to assist MOHSW in identifying, implementing, and evaluating\nappropriate health sector reforms in the context of decentralization. Decentralization offers\ndistricts  and  provinces  opportunities  to  adapt  the  health  system  to  local  needs  and  the\nconditions,  according  to  national  policies  and  with  technical  guidance  from  MOHSW.  TA\nresources will be used to support reforms not only at the central level, but also in the districts\nand the provinces. The TA will not be limited to the project area but will cover all districts and\nprovinces, according to the needs and MOHSW request.\n4. The TA will have two components: (i) consulting services, and (ii) operation research\nand analysis. TA funds will be used to engage a long-term consultant for 36 person-months.\nThe consultant will ensure continuity in advisory services. The role of the consultant will be to\nassist MOHSW and local health services in identifying opportunities for health sector reforms;\ndeveloping reform programs and implementation plans; assessing the potential impact of the\nreforms on the poor and vulnerable groups; monitoring implementation of the reforms; and\nevaluating  the  overall  impact  of  the  reforms  on  health  services  quality,  efficiency  and\nsustainability. The consultant will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\n5. The  second  component  will  consist  of  resources  to  be  allocated  by  MOHSW  in\nconsultation with ADB, for operations research studies in support of health sector reforms.

Cost Estimates\n6. The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000 equivalent, of which $790,000 will be the foreign\nexchange cost and $460,000 equivalent the local currency cost. ADB will provide a grant of $1.0\nmillion  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  to  cover  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $210,000\nequivalent of the local currency costs. The Government will finance $250,000 equivalent or 20\npercent of the total TA cost. Detailed TA cost estimates are provided in the Table 1.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n7. The MOHSW will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB will engage the long term\ninternational consultant. The operation research studies proposed by MOHSW will be reviewed\nand approved by ADB, which will engage consulting firms or individual consultants to implement\nthe studies.\n8. Consulting firms and / or individual consultants will be engaged to implement approved\nstudies,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The studies will\nneed to be completed within 36 months of TA approval. Workshops and seminars will be\norganized under the TA, by MOHSW and/or local government in the districts and the provinces\nto disseminate experiences and lessons learned.", "(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)\n(cid:2)(cid:6)\nASIAN  DEVELOPMENT  BANK\n(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:11)\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nR278-00\nCorrigendum 1\n27 November 2000\nCorrigendum to Document R278-00\nProposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant\nDecentralized Health Services Project\n(Indonesia)\nOn page 65, Appendix 12, page 2 of the above document, please amend\nparagraph 6 to read as follows:\n\u201cThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,250,000  equivalent,  of  which\n$790,000 will be the foreign exchange cost and $460,000 equivalent the local\ncurrency  cost.

Decentralization  presents  great  opportunities  for  improving  the  delivery  of  health\nservices, and the transition period shapes the form of health service delivery for the long term.\nIn the wake of change and adjustment during this period, it is important to ensure that the needs\nof the poor and vulnerable, who tend to be less vocal, are not overlooked and that mechanisms\nto protect this needs are developed.\n2. The project area is diverse in terms of the resource base that the local government has\nto provide with services, types of communities, and level of existing infrastructure, and therefore\nreflects the range of diverse conditions under which decentralization is taking place. It will\nprovide  models  for  addressing  the  needs  of  local  governments  serving  poor  and  nonpoor\ncommunities. The principal criterion for selection is a clear commitment from the district and\nprovincial government to address health sector issues. Despite the district-level focus of the\nproject,  all  districts  in  the  selected  provinces  are  included  in  the  program  for  effective\ncoordination of health services that extend beyond the district boundary.\n3. The project provinces and districts are diverse in sociocultural traditions, geography, and\nresource base. Aceh is a conservative province. Women's participation rate in the labor force is\nlow, and fertility rate is high. Ethnically distinct indigenous people live in the central highlands.\nWith decentralization, revenues from natural gas should provide good resources to the local\ngovernments. Bali enjoys significant revenue from tourism but under decentralization, tourism,\ntax revenues are not shared with the regions. In the health sector, there is scope for private for-\nprofit health services, but not in all districts. Paradoxically, local governments in Bali may have\nproblems in adequately addressing health and environmental problems (such as water supply\nand sanitation), especially for poor communities away from the tourist areas. Bengkulu, an\nisolated province with limited resource tax base, was severely hit by an earthquake in June\n2000. Riau has a rich tax base from oil fields on the mainland and a dynamic industrial zone on\nBatam Island off Singapore. But the province also has large areas of peat swamp characterized\nby low fertility and difficult access, and small isolated islands in the Riau archipelago between\nthe  island  of  Sumatra,  Singapore,  and  Kalimantan.  Indigenous  peoples  are  found  in  the\nmountainous highlands along the central Sumatra mountain range and in the Riau archipelago.\nNorth  Sulawesi  has  an  active  not-for-profit  private  health  sector.  While  some  parts  of  the\nprovince have relatively prosperous communities, others are very poor. Central Sulawesi has a\nlimited tax base and small, scattered communities along the narrow coastal strips and in the\nhighland areas. It is the most ethnically and linguistically complex province after Irian Jaya.\nSoutheast  Sulawesi  comprises  a  mix  of  old  communities  and  new  settlements.  Southeast\nSulawesi comprises a mix of old communities and new settlements, as it receives the overflow\nfrom land-short and historically disaster-prone South Sulawesi.\nB.  Conditions in the Project Province\n4. The number of poor and incidence of poverty in the project provinces and in the country\nas a whole are shown in Table A13.1. Although the incidence of poverty in some project\nprovinces  is  lower  than  the  national  average,  the  project  provinces  contain  a  significant\nproportion of Indonesia\u2019s poor. Furthermore, in a number of provinces such as Aceh, Central\nSulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi, conditions have continued to decline due to the social\nunrest or to an influx of internally displaced persons.", "68\nAppendix 13, page 2\nTable A13.1: Incidence of Poverty and Number of Poor by Province, February 1999\nProvince Urban Rural Total\nNumber Percent Number Percent Number Percent\n(\u2018000) (\u2018000) (\u2018000)\nAceh  104.7 10.15  497.5 16.30  602.1 14.75\nBali  114.5 9.42  143.3 7.94  257.8 8.53\nBengkulu  97.7 22.01  204.6 18.88  302.3 19.79\nRiau  142.7 9.06  447.0 16.95  589.7 14.00\nCentral Sulawesi  125.7 23.05  473.7 30.68  599.4 28.69\nNorth Sulawesi  102.9 12.88  401.8 20.33  504.6 18.19\nSoutheast Sulawesi  68.7 15.73  436.2 34.23  504.9 29.51\nIndonesia  15,642.5 19.41  32,332.2 26.03  47,974.7 23.43\nSource:  Statistical Appendix, Assessment of Poverty in Indonesia October 2000.\n5. Following the crisis, rising food prices and declining real incomes drove up the share of\nexpenditure on food items across all income levels and in all provinces.

Following the crisis, the depth of poverty increased, i.e., the average amount of income\nrequired to raise the poor above the poverty line increased in all provinces except Bali, where\nconditions improved slightly in urban areas and remained the same in rural areas. This is\nindicated by the change in the poverty gap index in Table A13.3. The intensity or severity of\npoverty also increased. This means an increase in the proportion of ultrapoor as part of all poor,\nespecially in the easternmost provinces on the island of Sulawesi.", "69\nAppendix 13, page 3\nTable A13.3: Poverty Gap Index and Poverty Severity Index, 1997 and 1999a\nProvince Poverty Gap Index (P1) Poverty Severity (FGT) Index (P2)\n1997 1999 1997 1999\nUrban Rural Total Urban Rural Total Urban Rural Total Urban Rural Total\nAceh 1.63 1.59 1.60 1.88 1.74 1.78 4.07 4.04 4.05 5.38 4.56 4.77\nBali 1.54 1.08 1.39 1.40 1.08 1.27 3.50 1.86 2.95 3.04 2.11 2.65\nBengkulu 1.53 1.20 1.29 1.59 1.28 1.35 3.73 2.12 2.54 4.10 2.68 2.99\nRiau 1.50 1.51 1.51 1.74 1.88 1.83 3.19 3.89 3.69 4.23 5.49 5.1\nCentral Sulawesi 1.36 1.44 1.44 2.52 1.85 1.98 2.45 3.62 3.54 9.85 5.12 6.09\nNorth Sulawesi 1.40 1.32 1.34 1.35 1.97 1.87 3.64 2.90 3.08 2.66 5.94 5.37\nSouth East Sulawesi 1.55 1.57 1.57 2.26 1.91 2.01 3.73 4.15 4.04 7.96 5.29 6.05\nIndonesia 1.69 1.48 1.56 1.99 1.79 1.87 4.54 3.55 3.91 5.99 5.03 5.39\na  The poverty gap index refers to the average income of the poor compared with the poverty line. It is a measure of\nthe depth of poverty. The poverty severity index indicates the intensity of poverty as indicated by the proportion of\npoor whose incomes are well below that of the average income of the poor.\nSource:  Statistical Appendix, Assessment of Poverty in Indonesia October 2000.\n7. In Indonesia, focusing on areas that are poor is important in terms of equity, regional\nintegration, and balanced growth. It is equally important to focus on areas that contain a large\nnumber of poor. High incidence and a large number of poor do not necessarily go hand in hand,\nas provinces are equal in neither population nor area. Furthermore, while improvement in social\nindicators can often be expected to follow from income growth and reduction of income poverty,\nin some cases it may be necessary to make special efforts through targeted interventions. For\nexample, Bali has a high proportion of children affected by malnutrition for a province with a\nfairly  low  incidence  of  income  poverty.  Similarly,  Aceh  has  the  most  serious  problem  of\nmalnutrition in children under 5, despite its lower than average poverty incidence. Less than 60\npercent of the population in Bengkulu and Riau have access to safe water. Central Sulawesi\nand Aceh have the lowest access to sanitation (Table A13.4).\nTable A13.4: Socioeconomic Overview of the Project Provinces\nProvince Life Male Female Underweight Pop. with Pop. with\nExpectancy Literacy Literacy Children Access to Access to\nat Birth Rate 1999 Rate 1999 under Five Safe Water own\n1998 (%) (%) Years a 1999 Sanitation\n(Yr) (%) (%) 1999 (%)\nAceh 66.8 94.4 85.4 56.12 62.9 51.0\nBali 68.78 88.5 71.9 22.64 89.0 55.2\nBengkulu 64.31 94.9 86.9 24.88 52.8 56.5\nRiau 67.01 95.7 89.5 37.42 40.5 77.9\nCentral Sulawesi 61.72 94.1 87.9 37.18 69.5 41.1\nNorth Sulawesi 67.33 96.6 96.3 37.54 75.7 50.4\nSoutheast Sulawesi 66.8 89.4 77.4 26.38 67.5 56.2\nIndonesia 65.6 90.6 79.3 35.40 74.3 54.1\na  Severely and moderately underweight.\n8. Aceh and Central Sulawesi are centers of internal unrest, while Southeast Sulawesi and\nNorth Sulawesi are receiving areas for displaced persons from Maluku.

A  further\ncomplication arises when the victims of unrest attempt to relocate themselves elsewhere. This is\na disruptive influence in the receiving area regardless of the inhabitants goodwill or lack thereof.", "70\nAppendix 13, page 4\nIn Bengkulu, the violent earthquake in June 2000 damaged health infrastructure and disrupted\neconomic life in the province.\n1.  Health and Poverty\n9. Without  government  interventions,  the  poor  have  little  access  to  essential  health\nservices. Poverty also results in unhealthy living conditions that have an immediate impact on\nhealth and nutrition status. The poor have less access to clean water and adequate nutrition.\nPoor women are more vulnerable to the consequences of ill health and are less able to guard\nthe health of their children. Poor health also diminishes learning and working capabilities, and\nreduces a person\u2019s competitiveness in the labor market.\n10. Communicable diseases and vaccine-preventable infectious diseases typically affect the\npoor more than the nonpoor. The incidence of tuberculosis is much higher among the urban\npoor due to crowded conditions and poor diet. Diarrhea, a major cause of death in children, is\nmore frequent in neighborhoods with limited access to safe water and sanitation. Inadequate\ninformation and opportunity costs prevent poor mothers to visit the health center, and children\nare not immunized or untreated minor illnesses develop major consequences. Access to safe\nwater and to sanitation facilities in the project provinces by and large is lower than in the\nnational  level.  The  lower  the  expenditure  level,  the  lower  the  access  to  clean  water  and\nsanitation facilities  (Table A13.5).\nTable A13.5: Access to Clean Water and Sanitation, 1999\nProvince Access to Clean Water Access to Own Sanitation\nQ1a Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Total Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Total\nAceh 49.8 57.1 65.9 66.4 77.0 62.9 47.7 42.7 47.5 55.4 65.0 51.0\nBali 73.3 84.2 85.4 88.4 95.1 89.0 31.4 37.1 46.5 57.4 67.6 55.2\nBengkulu 43.8 41.7 44.6 53.5 74.7 52.8 35.9 45.7 57.7 63.7 69.2 56.5\nRiau 20.9 24.7 32.9 38.2 57.5 40.5 62.9 77.1 76.1 78.3 81.9 77.9\nCentral Sulawesi 55.4 64.4 70.6 79.9 90.6 69.5 23.3 32.3 42.8 54.1 71.1 41.1\nNorth Sulawesi 58.3 71.1 77.9 81.1 82.7 75.7 28.3 38.7 45.7 59.4 68.5 50.4\nSoutheast Sulawesi 58.2 60.6 73.3 74.9 85.8 67.5 49.7 54.4 62.8 56.4 67.6 56.2\nIndonesia 62.9 69.2 73.1 78.2 88.1 74.3 39.0 45.0 51.8 61.0 73.7 54.1\n   a Q1 refers to the lowest expenditure quintile, Q5 refers to the top 20 percent.\nSource:  Statistical Appendix, Assessment of Poverty in Indonesia October 2000.\n11. Accessibility and use of health services are reflected in some indicators, including the\npercentage  of  births  attended  by  qualified  health  staff  and  use  of  contraceptives.  JPS-BK\nmonitoring  indicates  that  contact  rates  at  public  health  facilities  have  increased;  however,\noverall contact rates for both public and private health providers have decreased as a result of\nthe crisis.

Decentralization  creates  new  risks  for  public  health,  particularly  for  women\u2019s  heath\nissues, as funding of health sector programs will depend on the priorities of local officials. While\ndecentralization  can  ensure  that  health  programs  are  more  focused  on  local  needs,  local\nofficials, especially members of the local parliament must be educated in health care issues. For\nthis reason, the decentralized health services provides a strong emphasis on advocacy and\ntraining of local decision makers. In addition, to ensure that programs are not driven by the\npriorities of the technocrats, the Project provides for preparation of district health plans through\na participatory process. The district committee will be established to include women and men\nrepresentatives from the communities. The task of the health committee is to review existing\nhealth services and access to them by the poor, nonpoor, women and men; and to identify local\nhealth needs by gender. The Project will provide better access to health services to the poor,\nwomen,  and  children  by  strengthening  basic  health  programs,  reproductive  health,  family\nplanning, and nutrition.\nC.  Project Design Components to Promote Poverty Targeting\n16. A number of measures were built into the design of the Project to ensure that the needs\nof women, the poor, and vulnerable groups including indigenous people are given priority and\nthat the poor have disproportionate access to the benefits.\n(i)  District  proposals  will  be  evaluated  for  funding  according  to  several  criteria\nincluding how the proposed investment will benefit the poor, women, and the", "73\nAppendix 13, page 7\nvulnerable. Training and technical support will be provided during the first phase\nof project implementation to assist health staff and the community in assessing\nand reporting the impact of the proposal on the poor.\n(ii)  Proposals that include the needs of the local poor and vulnerable groups will be\ngiven priority. Priority will be given in financing primary health care services,\nfamily planning, and availability of contraceptives.\n(iii)  Advocacy and information campaigns will sensitize local decision makers and\nmembers of civil society. Training will sensitize local health staff to the specific\nneeds of the poor and vulnerable groups.\n(iv)  Advocacy, information campaigns, and training activities will highlight the special\nneeds of women and the poor. The Project will finance consulting services and\ntraining on gender and health, including appropriate information, education and\ncommunication  materials.  Maternal  mortality  and  morbidity,  and  reproductive\nhealth  services  will  be  given  special  attention.  Benchmark  data  and  data\ncollected for project monitoring and performance evaluation will be disaggregated\nby gender.\n(v)  Training activities target a gender balance of 50 percent female. This will not only\nimprove skills and qualification of female health staff but also ensure that more\nfemale  health  staff  are  ready  to  assist  and  answer  the  particular  needs  of\nwomen.\n(vi)  Policy dialogue will emphasize better targeting of public subsidies, and local\nmechanisms will be developed to continue the health safety net program linking\npublic subsidies to the poor and vulnerable groups."], "metadata": {"Author": "ldm", "CreationDate": "D:20010213182402Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131111191828+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R278-00rrp.doc"}}
