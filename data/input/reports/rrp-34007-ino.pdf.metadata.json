The Project\nwill be implemented in two phases in 50 districts and 12 cities of 7 provinces:\nAceh, Bali, Bengkulu, Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Riau, and Southeast\nSulawesi.  In  the  first  phase,  activities  will  concentrate  on  developing  local\ncapacity to plan, manage and deliver health services. Local governments and\nhealth  offices  will  prepare  health  sector  development  plans  and  investment\nproposals  to  improve  service  quality,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness,  and\nproposals to introduce locally appropriate health sector reforms. In the second\nphase,  the  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  technically  and\neconomically  justified  proposals  that  address  the  priority  needs  of  the  poor\nand vulnerable groups.\n\nPrimary: Human development\nSecondary: Poverty reduction\n\nWhere  new  facilities  are  constructed,  an  environmental  impact  assessment\nand environmental management and monitoring plans will be prepared before\nthe  subproject  proposal  is  approved.  With  expected  improvement  in\nsanitation,  the  overall  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  environment  will  be\npositive.\n\nImplementation of decentralization will start in early 2001, in accordance\nwith  the  laws  on  decentralization  voted  in  May  1999.  Decentralization\noffers  opportunities  to  better  answer  local  health  needs  through  locally\nadapted reforms and specific investments in the health sector. However,\nrapid  implementation  of  decentralization  could  create  a  major  risk  of\nbreakdown  in  the  delivery  of  public  health  services  because  the\ntraditionally  centralized  planning  and  management  of  health  services\nhave not prepared local staff adequately to take over this responsibility.\nThere is a need to support local health staff during the transition period\nand  prepare  them  for  their  new  responsibilities.  While  assisting  local\ngovernments  to  maintain  health  services  delivery,  the  Project  will  help\nlocal  governments  identify  local  needs,  giving  priority  to  programs  that\ntarget and benefit the poor, and improve health service quality.\n\nThe  objectives  are  to  strengthen  local  capacity  in  health  services\ndelivery,  including  planning  and  management,  to  ensure  continuous\naccess to quality health and family planning services, particularly by the\npoor; and to improve quality, cost-efficiency, and sustainability of health\nand family planning services in the project area. Advocacy, training, and\ntechnical  support  will  first  build  up  local  governments\u2019  commitment  and\ncapacity.  Subsequently,  the  Project  will  help  districts  and  provinces\nimplement appropriate health sector reforms and support investments to\nbetter address the needs of the poor and vulnerable groups and improve\nservices quality, efficiency, and effectiveness.\n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nObjectives\nand Scope\n\n\fCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\niii\n\nActivities  are  grouped  into  four  components:  (i)  advocacy  and  capacity\nbuilding; (ii) adapting health services to local needs through appropriate\nhealth  sector  reforms;  (iii)  investments  for  health  and  family  planning;\nand (iv) project management, including implementation, monitoring, and\nevaluation.\n\nThe  estimated  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $87.0  million  equivalent,  of  which\n$36.7 million is the foreign exchange cost, and $50.3 million equivalent is the\nlocal currency cost.\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal Cost Percent\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\n36.7\n-\n\n36.7\n\n28.3\n22.0\n\n50.3\n\n65.0\n22.0\n\n87.0\n\n74.7\n25.3\n\n100\n\n($ million)\n\nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights\n50,531,000 from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds\nresources  with  a  maturity  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8\nyears.  It  will  carry  1  percent  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period\nand 1.5 percent thereafter.\n\nConsidering  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  difficulties  and  fiscal  constraints  in\nthe  short  term,  it  is  proposed  that  ADB  finance  80  percent  of  the\nproject  cost  during  the  first  three  years  of  implementation  and  60\npercent during the last two years. This proposal is in accordance with\nthe  graduation  policy,  which  allows  ADB  financing  to  exceed  the\ncountry cost-sharing limit under exceptional circumstances and where\njustified on project grounds.\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\n30 September 2006\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nThe Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare\n(MOHSW). The National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN)\nwill  support  MOHSW  for  the  family  planning  and  family  welfare\nactivities of the Project.\n\nIn each district, a district health committee \u2013 with representatives from the\nlocal government, district health services and BKKBN, and civil society\u2013will\nparticipate  in  identifying  appropriate  local  investments  and  reforms  and\nmonitoring implementation. A district implementation unit will be responsible\nfor  implementing  project  activities.  A  provincial  technical  review  team\ninvolving  technical  experts  and  representatives  of  the  community,  will\ncomment on the district proposals. In each province, a project coordination\nand  implementation  unit  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  at  the\nprovincial  level  and  support  to  the  districts.  A  central  project  coordination\nunit in MOHSW will coordinate project activities between all provinces and\ndistricts. A central technical committee and a central steering committee will\n\n\fProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\niv\n\nprovide overall technical and policy guidance, respectively, to the Project.\n\nAll ADB-financed civil works and goods will be procured in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  For  procurement  of  goods,\ninternational  competitive  bidding  will  apply  for  contracts  estimated  to\ncost $500,000 equivalent or more. Supply contracts for goods other than\nvehicles,  motorcycles  and  office  equipment  estimated  to  cost  the\nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  less  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational  shopping  (IS).  Civil  works  contract  \u2013  all  estimated  to  cost\nless  than  1.0  million  equivalent  -  and  supply  contract  for  vehicles,\nmotorcycles and office equipment will be awarded on the basis of local\ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB).  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  less  than\n$50,000 equivalent may involve the participation of local communities in\naccordance with procedures to be agreed with ADB. Direct purchase of\ngoods costing less than $50,000 equivalent will be allowed.\n\nInternational  and  domestic  consultants  and  consulting  firms  will  be\nengaged  to  (i)  support  project  implementation  units  and  technical\ncommittees, and (ii) provide technical expertise. Part of the consulting\nservices  provision  will  be  reserved  to  provide  project  managers\nflexibility  in  engaging  consultants  according  to  local  needs  identified\nduring  phase  I  of  the  Project.  To  support  project  management,\ndomestic  consultants  will  be  engaged,  where  needed,  to  complement\nexisting  staff  capabilities.  Depending  on  the  needs  of  the  62  districts\nand cities, a maximum of 4,394 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices  may  be  required  for  project  management.  To  provide\ntechnical expertise, the Project will fund a total of 37 person-months of\ninternational  and  225  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.\nLocal consulting firms will be recruited for information technology, and\nenvironmental  and  social  impact  assessments.  All  consultants  will  be\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nrecruited \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n1 March 2006\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\nProject Risks\n\nPoor and vulnerable groups in the project area will particularly benefit from\nthe Project. The Project will facilitate continuous availability of quality health\nservices  during  the  difficult  period  of  transition  to  decentralization.\nInvestments and reform proposals from the districts will address the needs\nof the local poor. Capacity-building activities will benefit not only health staff\nbut also other members of the civil society. The Project aims at a minimum\nof 50 percent women among the beneficiaries of the training activities.\n\nThe  main  project  risks  relate  to  the  fast  pace  of  implementation  of\ndecentralization,  resulting  in  lack  of  clarity  and  understanding  of  the\nnew roles and responsibilities of the various levels and institutions. The\nweak  capacity  of  the  district  and  provincial  staff  due  to  the  traditional\ncentralized  system  will  be  addressed  through  intensive  capacity-\nbuilding activities at the beginning of implementation. As a condition for\n\n\fTechnical\nAssistance\n\nv\n\nproject  implementation  in  the  district,  availability  of  counterpart  funds\nmust be guaranteed by the head of the concerned district.\n\nThe  Project  will  be  accompanied  by  technical  assistance  (TA)  to\nsupport  policy  reforms  in  the  health  sector.  The  TA  will  permit  the\nGovernment,  and  districts  and  provinces  in  the  project  area  to  take\nadvantage  of  decentralization  to  identify,  develop,  and  implement\nlocally  appropriate  health  sector  reforms.  The  TA  will  finance  36\nperson-months  of  an  individual  consultant,  based  in  Jakarta,  to  work\nwith  the  MOHSW  policy  advisory  group.  The  consultant  will  be\nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants.  The  TA  will  also  finance  operations  research,  advocacy,\nand studies in support of health sector reforms. The TA is proposed to\nbe  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund  (JSF).  Application  for  the\nfinancing from JSF has been made to the Government of Japan. The\napplication  for  JSF  funding  is  under  review  by  the  Government  of\nJapan.\n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Decentralized Health Services Project. The Report also\ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  for  Support  for  Health  Sector  Policy  Reforms,  and  if\nthe proposed loan is approved by the Board, and subject to the approval of the Government of\nJapan having been obtained for the financing of the technical assistance from the Japan Special\nFund1  (JSF),  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  shall  approve  the\ntechnical assistance.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nframework \n\nthe  broad \n\nfor  decentralization, \n\nIn May 1999, the Indonesian Parliament adopted two laws2 requiring decentralization of\n2. \nGovernment  services  and  functions  by  2001.  The  principal  feature  of  the  legislation  is\nsubstantial  delegation  of  operational  authority  and  responsibility  to  Indonesia\u2019s  districts.\nDecentralization will impose significant structural and financial changes. Although the legislation\nthe  Government\u2019s  decentralization\nprovides \nimplementation  plans  have  not  been  finalized.  Many  regulations  are  still  in  draft  or  under\ndiscussion, including those on (i) transfer of civil servants, assets, and spending authorities to\nthe districts; (ii) fiscal transfers and shared revenues required to finance transferred functions;\n(iii) guidelines for local government borrowing; (iv) accountability of local governments, financial\nmanagement,  and  adherence  to  the  budget  process;  and  (v)  financial  information  systems.  A\nrapid  shift  from  a  highly  centralized  system  to  a  system  providing  considerable  (but  not  fully\ndefined) autonomy to poorly prepared district administrations risks disruption of essential social\nservices,  including  health  services.  This  prompted  the  Government  to  seek  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance to support decentralization in the health sector. In March\n2000,  the  Government  asked  the  ADB  Country  Program  Consultation  Mission  to  process  the\nDecentralized Health Services Project for implementation beginning in early 2001.\n\n3. \nA  technical  assistance  (TA)  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  April  2000  confirmed  the  potential\nimpacts  on  the  health  of  the  population,  particularly  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  groups,  and\ndeveloped  a  small-scale  TA3  to  support  project  processing.  In  May  2000,  an  ADB  team\ndeveloped  the  project  framework  (Appendix  1)  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Health\n(MOH).4 Workshops were organized with representatives of all districts in several provinces to\nreview and adapt the framework to the local context and to start preparing investment proposals\nbased  on  the  framework.  For  the  first  time,  frameworks  and  initial  investment  proposals  were\nprepared  independently  by  the  beneficiaries.  Domestic  consultants  funded  by  TA  helped  the\ndistricts  and  provinces  present  their  proposals  in  a  standardized  format.  A  Loan  Fact-Finding\nMission  (5-30  June  2000)  visited  districts  and  provinces  and  reached  an  understanding  with\nrepresentatives  of  the  local  and  central  governments  on  project  coverage  and  implementation\nstrategy.  During  the  Appraisal  Mission5  (25  September\u201323  October  2000),  the  districts\n\n                                                \n1  An application has been made to the Government of Japan for the financing of the technical assistance from the\n\nJapan Special Fund. The application is currently under consideration.\n\n2  Law on Regional Autonomy (Law No. 22/99) and Law on Fiscal Balance (Law No. 25/99).\n3  TA  3448-INO:  Decentralized Health Services,  for  $150,000,  approved  on  26  May  2000,  supplemented  by  a\n\n$30,000 grant from the Government of Australia.\n\n4  In August 2000, the ministry was renamed the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW).\n5  The Mission comprised J. Jeugmans, Senior Social Sector Specialist/Mission Leader; P. Stokoe, Resident Adviser\nin  Indonesia  for  Health  Sector;  P.  Spantigati,  Programs  Officer;  K.  Emzita,  Counsel;  M.  Sultana,  Social\nDevelopment  Specialist;  K.  Takamiya,  Young  Professional,  Economist;  S.  Kataoka,  Staff  Consultant,  Financial\nAnalyst.  The  Mission  was  assisted  by  D.  Kelaher,  Health  Sector  Development  Specialist,  under  TA  financed  by\n\n\f2\n\npresented  their  preliminary  investment  proposals,  including  inputs  from  the  provinces  and  the\nMinistry  of  Health  and  Social  Welfare  (MOHSW).  Based  on  the  proposals,  field  visits,  and\ndiscussions  with  local  beneficiaries  and  stakeholders,  and  in  agreement  with  MOHSW,  the\nNational  Family  Planning  Coordinating  Board  (BKKBN),  the  National  Development  Planning\nAgency  (BAPPENAS),  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Appraisal  Mission  finalized  the  project\nproposal. The proposal was negotiated in Manila on 16-17 November 2000.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nPerformance and Organization\n\n4. \nThe  health  status  of  the  Indonesian  population  gradually  improved  over  the  last  three\ndecades. The infant mortality rate for example declined from 145 infant deaths per thousand live\nbirths in 1970 to 40 in 1999.6 However, the maternal mortality rate (MMR)\u2013estimated between\n390 and 450 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births\u2013is among the highest in the region and is\nvery high by international standards.7 While most health and nutrition indicators have improved,\nIndonesia\u2019s  health  indicators  remain  disappointing  compared  with  those  of  neighboring\ncountries.8  Moreover,  such  gains  were  uneven  and  significant  differences  remained  between\nregions and provinces, between urban and rural areas, and especially between the rich and the\npoor.  Although  cardiovascular  and  chronic  diseases  became  the  main  cause  of  mortality  in\n1992, infectious and parasitic diseases dominate morbidity and are still a major cause of deaths,\naffecting  particularly  the  poor.  Tuberculosis,  malaria,  respiratory  infections,  and  diarrhea  are\nmajor public health issues. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Government made serious efforts\nto develop a network of health facilities and ensure physical access to health services all over\nthe  country.  This  policy  was  relatively  successful  in  achieving  physical  targets:  the  average\ndistance to a health center or a hospital is 5 kilometers (km) in rural areas and 1.5 km in urban\nareas.  But  the  use  of  health  services  (bed  occupancy  rates  in  hospitals,  outpatient\nconsultations)  has  been  low,  at  least  in  the  public  sector,  suggesting  low  client  satisfaction.\nAppendix 2 gives information on medical issues in the project area.\n\nThe  impact  of  the  economic  crisis,  which  started  in  1997,  is  not  yet  fully  reflected  in\n5. \nbroad health indicators such as MMR, infant mortality rate, and mortality among children under\nfive years. Several surveys focusing on populations and regions at higher risk indicate that the\ncrisis has particularly affected the poor in both urban and rural areas and the populations at risk.\nFor example, malnutrition in children and women (pregnant women and lactating mothers) has\nbecome  of  particular  concern.  Before  the  crisis,  growth  retardation  measured  on  a  height-for-\nage  scale9  was  estimated  to  affect  25  percent  of  the  children,  and  the  incidence  of  low  birth\nweight was about 15 percent. With the crisis, health services started reporting cases of severe\nmalnutrition. Follow-up studies indicate that, while the average weight for age was not affected\n                                                                                                                                                         \nAusAID)  and  domestic  consultants  Pohan,  Hussein,  Poerwanto,  Laksono  (under  TA  3448-INO);  and  Nur  and\nArbanto (on loan from other ADB health projects in Indonesia).\n\n6  1999  data  are  from  UNICEF.  Official  MOH  data,  based  on  the  Demographic  and  Health  Survey  and  the  health\nmodule of the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) are available only up to 1997 and 1998 respectively.\n7  The usual causes of maternal mortality (hemorrhage, infections, and obstructed labor) are occurring in women also\n\noften affected by malnutrition.\n\n8  The  Human  Development  Index  2000,  which  combines  health,  educational  and  economic  achievements,  ranks\nIndonesia 109th of 174 countries, compared with Singapore 24th, Malaysia 60th, Thailand 76th, Philippines 77th and\nChina 99 th.\n\n9  Reduced  height-for-age  (stunting)  is  an  indicator  of  long-lasting  malnutrition,  while  reduced  weight-for-age  is  an\n\nindicator of recent malnutrition.\n\n\f3\n\nby  the  crisis,  there  were  wider  variations  than  before  (as  reflected  by  the  statistical  standard\ndeviations): children who were most at risk or already suffering from mild forms of malnutrition\nbecame severely malnourished.10\n\nIndonesia  has  developed  a  successful  family  planning  program,  organized  by  BKKBN.\n6. \nWith its slogan \u201cSmall Happy Family,\u201d BKKBN advocates birth spacing and small families, and\nensures  availability  of  modern  methods  of  contraception  all  over  the  country,  resulting  in  a\nsignificant contraceptive prevalence rate (at 57.4 percent in1997). The average number of births\nper woman during her childbearing age (i.e., the total fertility rate) declined from 4.1 in 1985 to\n2.5 in 1999, and the annual population growth rate steadily decreased from 2.2 percent in 1985\nto 1.7 percent in 1993. BKKBN is centrally organized and managed with a hierarchy down to the\nsubdistricts. Policy and programs are developed, monitored, and evaluated at the central level.\nBKKBN village volunteers provide general information on contraception in their community, and\nsupport  contraceptive  users  (reminding  for  example  pill  users  not  to  forget  their  daily  pill).\nBKKBN field-workers advocate family planning in the community, supervise village volunteers,\nand  collect  field  data  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  program.  MOHSW  health  center  or\ndistrict  hospital  staff  are  responsible  for  medical  examinations  and  interventions  (providing\ninjections,  inserting  intrauterine  devices).  Although  the  relatively  narrow  scope  of  the  family\nplanning  program  (compared  with  MOHSW  programs)  makes  implementation  less  difficult,\nsome  features  of  the  program,  particularly  its  flexibility  and  results-oriented  approach,  have\nprobably  contributed  to  its  success.  Different  targets  are  established  for  each  province,  and\ndifferent  program  components  are  emphasized,  taking  into  consideration  the  local  social,\npolitical,  and  economic  conditions.  BKKBN  has  also  been  relatively  successful  in  mobilizing\nresources from aid agencies, the Government, and the private sector.\n\nin \n\nthe  provinces  and \n\n7. \nThe Indonesian health system relies heavily on the public sector, which, until now, has\nbeen  highly  centralized.  In  the  past,  the  health  ministry  in  Jakarta  developed  health  programs\nand allocated resources according to centrally defined priorities based on data collected in the\nfield  but  consolidated  and  analyzed  centrally.  Government  line  ministries  have  representative\noffices \ntransmitting  and  ensuring\nthe  districts  responsible \nimplementation of the central ministries\u2019 instructions. In parallel, each province and district have\na  sector  unit  (Dinas)  technically  responsible  to  the  provincial  or  district  government  and\nadministratively responsible to the provincial governor or the administrative head of the district\n(bupati).11 Collaboration between the two offices is necessary but sometimes difficult because of\ndifferent  priorities  at  the  central  and  local  levels.  At  the  district  level,  the  head  of  the  district\nhealth services represents both MOHSW and the district health office that reports to the bupati.\nIn  the  last  few  years,  the  former  MOH  has  accelerated  decentralization  in  the  health  sector,\nincreasing  the  authority  of  the  provincial  and  district  offices  for  planning,  budgeting,  and\nprogram  implementation,  but  many  centrally  developed  health  programs  remained  in  place.\nPersonnel management is centralized. Although governors and bupatis administer their staff in\nthe provincial and district offices (assignment, promotion), the central level pays salaries. Young\ngraduates under contract are assigned to the provinces and districts by the central level.\n\nfor \n\n8. \nThe  private  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  the  delivery  of  health  services  in  many\nplaces.  Almost  everywhere,  doctors  in  the  public  system  also  provide  private  services  after\n\n                                                \n10 Data  from  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  on  MOH  Nutrition  Unit  presented  by  ADB  at  the  9th  meeting  of  the\n\nConsultative Group on Indonesia, Jakarta, February 2000.\n\n11 Governors and bupatis were previously centrally appointed and reported to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Now they\nare elected by the members of the province and district parliaments (DPRD). Larger cities have an administrative\nstatus  and  structure  comparable  to  that  of  districts;  for  simplicity,  references  in  the  text  to  districts  and  bupatis\nsubsume cities and city mayors (walikota) within the project area.\n\n\f4\n\noffice  hours.  Typically  in  better-off  areas,  especially  in  urban  communities,  full-time  private\npractitioners also offer their services. The availability of these private for-profit services is linked\nto  community  income\u2013or  poverty\u2013status.  In  the  richer  provinces  (Bali,  Riau),  private  for-profit\nhealth  services  are  available  and  offer  quality  services.  In  many  rural  areas  and  less  favored\nurban  areas,  religious  and  other  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  usually  not  for  profit,\nhave set up health centers and sometimes small hospitals for the local populations, often filling\ngap coverage or complementing the public sector. In 1998, 40.7 percent, 52.7 percent, and 4.5\npercent  of  the  population  were  using  public,  private,  and  traditional  health  care  services,\nrespectively (SUSENAS data). Unfortunately, public and private sectors have been developing\nand  functioning  in  parallel,  with  very  little  coordination  and  cooperation,  except  in  family\nplanning,  where  BKKBN  strongly  supported  the  demand  for  and  provision  of  private  family\nplanning services for those who could afford them.\n\n9. \nTotal expenditure for health is low, increasing slightly from 1.0 percent of gross domestic\nproduct  (GDP)  in  1995,  to  1.2  percent  in  1998.  As  a  percentage  of  total  Government\nexpenditure, health expenditures varied from 2.9 percent in 1985, 3.3 percent in 1995, and 2.9\npercent  in  1998.  Regardless  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  health  sector,  the\neconomic downturn reduced available resources. In real terms, Government health expenditure\ndeclined  by  16.5  percent  between  1995  and  1998.  Out-of-pocket  payments  by  households\ndeclined from 69 percent of total health expenditure in 1995 to 42 percent in 1998 reflecting, in\npart, more limited household resources. The difference was covered by an increase in external\nsupport.  The  Government  has  committed  to  allocate  at  least  3  percent  of  the  FY2000  budget\nand at least 4 percent of the FY2001 budget for health, nutrition, and family planning programs.\nChronically low funding of public health services affects service quality and effectiveness, which\nin  turn  have  an  impact  on  the  use  of  public  health  services  and  the  health  status  of  the\npopulation.\n\n2. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n10. \nThe health service delivery system, managed centrally from Jakarta, no longer answers\nadequately  the  needs  and  the  demand  of  the  local  populations.  Despite  relatively  satisfactory\nphysical  coverage,  given  the  geographic  and  climatic  constraints,  health  indicators  have  not\nimproved as rapidly as those in neighboring countries. Relatively poor health service quality in\nthe  public  sector  affects  service  utilization12  and  effectiveness.  There  is  a  need  to  rehabilitate\nand  upgrade  some  facilities  and  improve  medical  equipment,  both  for  diagnostic  and  curative\npurpose.  Besides  insufficient  financing  and  insufficient  attention  to  local  needs,  major  issues\nrelate  to  the  lack  of  local  personnel  sufficiently  qualified  in  health  service  management  and  to\nstructural and organizational issues.\n\n11. \nA consequence of a centrally managed health system is a generally weak management\ncapacity  at  the  local  level.  With  some  exceptions,  local  health  staff  have  been  trained  to\nimplement  instructions  but  not  to  take  initiative  and  responsibility.  Health  workers  have  been\nrequired  to  apply  centrally  developed  instructions,  often  without  clearly  understanding  why.\nTheir  performance  is  evaluated  based  on  process  indicators  rather  than  outputs:  a  certain\nnumber  of  reports  must  be  filled,  and  national  programs  request  regular  data  on  program\nactivities. The impact of these activities on health and nutrition status is not the responsibility of\nlocal staff. Health indicators are collated and analyzed at the central level with little feedback on\nresults to local staff.\n\n                                                \n12 Recent surveys indicate that service utilization increased significantly during and after the crisis.\n\n\f5\n\nCentralized  organization  creates  duplication, \n\ninefficiency,  and  waste.  Effective\n12. \ncollaboration and coordination between the MOHSW provincial office reporting to MOHSW and\nthe  provincial  health  services  office  reporting  to  the  local  government  have  depended  on\npersonalities,  rather  than  on  clear  job  descriptions  and  sharing  of  tasks.  There  is  a  need  to\nstreamline  the  health  sector  administrative  organization  in  the  district  and  the  province.\nDecentralization provides the opportunity and heightens the need for reorganization, but it also\ncreates insecurity and uncertainty among local health staff.\n\nFinancial  management  systems  are  fragmented,  complicated,  and  cumbersome.  Most\n13. \nfunding  is  still  controlled  from  the  center  and  distributed  through  vertical  programs.  Different\nbudget  sources  raise  problems  with  predictability  of  resource  flows.  Accountability  is  weak:\nfinancial expenditures are not linked to expected outcomes or analyzed to assess whether funds\nare efficiently expended. There is little review of overall program management and efficiency in\ndelivery of health services.\n\n14.  MOHSW has lately been making significant efforts to develop a managed care scheme\nrelying  on  health  insurance  with  the  objective  of  improving  efficiency  and  mobilizing  new\nresources for the health sector. For many years, the former MOH has promoted a small village-\nbased insurance scheme to cover outpatient health services. Other insurance schemes exist for\nthe  private  sector  and  for  civil  servants.  Over  the  last  few  years,  the  ministry  has  been\nadvocating  a  national  health  insurance  scheme  (JPKM),  similar  in  many  respects  to  health\nmaintenance  organizations  in  the  United  States  but  managed  at  local  (district  and  province)\nlevels. JPKM has been pilot-tested in several districts, but several aspects of the scheme need\nto  be  revised.  Health  care  financing,  however,  is  an  issue  that  local  governments  will  have  to\nface. If the national health insurance system is flexible, decentralization offers the opportunity to\nadapt the system to local conditions.\n\n15. \nThe development of the private health sector for-profit or not-for-profit NGOs signals the\nimportance of client satisfaction. Underutilization of public health facilities, particularly before the\ncrisis, reflects low popularity. Studies show that the share of the public sector in the provision of\nhealth care services, at 45 percent in 1997, declined to 40 percent in 1998 (before the impact of\nthe  crisis  could  be  assessed.  On  the  other  hand,  the  share  of  private  outpatient  facilities\nincreased from 46 percent to 52 percent from 1997 to 199813 (but apparently fell in 1999 as a\nresult of the crisis). Before the economic crisis, falls in contact rates were particularly notable in\npublic health centers and subcenters.\n\n3. \n\nHealth and Poverty\n\n16. \nA comparison of the richer and the poorer quintiles of the population shows that health\nindicators  improve  with  the  wealth  of  the  quintiles.14  Use  of  health  services  and  access  to\nmedical doctors also increase with the wealth of the patient. Table 1, referring to women\u2019s use\nof health services and based on preliminary analysis of 1998 SUSENAS data, indicates that at\nall levels in the private and the public sector, the poor consult modern health practitioners less\nfrequently when ill. These figures reflect a precrisis situation. More recent information, still under\nanalysis,  suggests  that  patients  shifted  from  the  private  to  the  public  sector  during  the  crisis,\nespecially for primary health care services in the health centers. The poor more often use self-\nmedication, and overall, women are more likely than men to use self-medication. On the other\nhand,  parents  often  consult  health  professionals  when  a  child  is  sick.  Another  source  of  data,\n\n                                                \n13 Traditional healers and self-treatment are the main other mechanisms for patients to get health care services.\n14 The World Bank. Socio-Economic Differences in Health, Nutrition and Population - Indonesia, May 2000.\n\n\f6\n\nWomen\n\nMOHSW  hospital-based  data,15  suggests  that  the  poor  can  rarely  afford  hospital  services:  in\n1998  in  public  sector  hospitals,  3.9  percent  of  outpatient  and  1.2  percent  of  inpatient  services\nwere for individuals categorized as poor.\n\nTable 1: Sources of Treatment by Poverty Quintiles for Women\n(%)\n\nSource\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\n1.3\n6.7\n42.2\n4.8\n\nPublic Hospitals\nPrivate services\nHealth Centers\nTraditional Healer\nand Others\nSelf Medication\n39.7\n45.1\nSource: preliminary analysis of SUSENAS data 1998.\n\n1.7\n9.3\n41.3\n4.2\n\n2.6\n13.3\n40.5\n4.0\n\n43.3\n\nQ4\n\n3.6\n19.3\n36.1\n3.2\n\nQ5\n\n5.4\n33.6\n24.4\n2.3\n\nTotal\n\n2.9\n16.2\n37.1\n3.7\n\nChildren Men\n\n2.3\n17.2\n52.1\n3.3\n\n3.3\n17.7\n37.9\n4.0\n\n37.8\n\n34.3\n\n40.1\n\n25.1\n\n38.1\n\n17. \nAs the poor cannot afford private health services except those from not-for-profit NGOs,\nthe  relatively  low  quality  and  ineffectiveness  of  the  public  health  sector  particularly  affect  their\nhealth status. Child malnutrition rates in Indonesia are high and malnutrition remains a serious\nproblem  for  vulnerable  population  groups.  The  difference  among  economic  groups  has\nnarrowed,  but  malnutrition  rates  among  children  from  poorer  households  are  still  well  above\nthose of the wealthier groups. In 1996, about 35 percent of preschoolers were underweight and\nsuffered from protein-energy malnutrition.\n\n18. \nThe centralized management of health services implied planning and budgeting from the\nsupply  side  point  of  view.  To  improve  equity  and  access  to  health  services  for  the  poor  and\nvulnerable  groups,  Government  resources  were  allocated  to  services  and  facilities  in  poorer\nareas.  To  maintain  access  to  health  services  for  the  poor,  tariffs  in  health  care  services  were\nsubsidized for everybody. However, only the cost of providing services was considered, not the\ncost  of  getting  services,  which  includes  travel,  waiting  time,  and  opportunity  costs,  often  more\nsignificant for the poor relative to income. Consequently, middle class and better-off populations\nwere  often  the  main  beneficiaries  of  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  ensure  universal  access  to\nhealth services.16\n\nThe economic crisis in 1997 was expected to have a negative impact on the delivery of\n19. \nessential social services and constrain access to and utilization of essential education, health,\nand nutrition services by the poor and vulnerable groups. Urgent and well-targeted action was\nneeded to reduce the impact of the crisis on the poor, protect utilization of basic health services,\nand control reemergence of severe malnutrition and communicable diseases. It was particularly\nimportant to protect the health and nutrition of pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children\nunder  two  years  of  age.  Providing  ready  access  to  qualified  health  providers  and  adequate\nhealth services, and improving maternal health care were expected to have a strongly positive\nimpact on the health of women, their children, and their families. But since these groups were\n\n                                                \n15 Division of Information, Directorate General of Medical Care, MOH.\n16 The  alternative  is  to  link  resources  with  demand,  and  to  subsidize  the  consumers  (the  poor)  rather  than  the\n\nproviders (health services and facilities).\n\n\f7\n\nless  likely  to  visit  health  centers,  strengthened  community  outreach  activities  supported  by\nvillage midwives17 were critical.\n\n20. \nIn  response  to  the  crisis,  the  Government  developed  a  Social  Safety  Net  Program  for\nHealth  (JPS-BK)  and  education  with  ADB  assistance.18  Through  JPS-BK,  the  Government\nadopted a comprehensive set of policy measures to help reduce the impact of the crisis on the\nmost  vulnerable  groups  while  laying  the  foundation  for  longer  term,  sustainable  health  sector\nreform.  Nationwide  policy  reforms  were  designed  to  safeguard  access  of  the  poor  to  basic\nhealth services and to strengthen management of health services delivery through progressive\ndecentralization of operational responsibilities. The policy reforms concentrated on maintaining\naccess  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  to  essential  health,  nutrition,  and  family  planning\nservices;  maintaining  quality  of  services  provided  to  the  poor;  enhancing  decentralized\nmanagement,  participation,  and  transparency;  and  improving  efficiency.  The  JPS-BK  was\nexpected to benefit economic and social development by ensuring that the targeted vulnerable\ngroups  and  individuals  retained  access  to  basic  health  services,  preserving  levels  of  basic\nhealth  and  nutrition  essential  to  current  and  future  productivity.  Agreed-upon  policy  reforms\nwould  improve  the  efficiency  and  quality  of  health,  family  planning,  and  nutrition  services\ndelivery  systems.  The  management  and  administrative  capacity  of  local  communities  and\noffices would improve through involvement in planning and implementing the JPS-BK.\n\nAn  innovative  block  grant  mechanism  was  introduced  to  enable  health  centers  to\n21. \nmaintain  the  quality  and  outreach  of  their  services.  The  block  grants  also  enabled  village\nmidwives  to  better  target  their  services  to  help  ensure  that  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable\ngroups  were  not  denied  access  to  medical  treatment.  The  continued  availability  of  basic\noutpatient services through the network of health centers was ensured. Immunization programs\nfor  children  were  maintained;  and  surveillance,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  of  communicable\ndiseases,  especially  acute  respiratory  infections  among  children,  and  tuberculosis,  were\nstrengthened.  Outreach  activities  by  midwives,  BKKBN  field  workers,  and  community  health\nvolunteers  that  provide  the  critical  link  between  the  public  health  system  and  the  poor,  who\nmight not otherwise utilize essential health and nutrition services, were expanded.\n\n22. \nPreliminary evaluation of the JPS-BK program indicates that, despite some weaknesses,\nresources  reached  the  targeted  communities  and  probably  protected  the  populations  from  a\nmajor  deterioration  of  their  health  status.  Utilization  of  public  health  services  improved.  Health\ncenters  contact  rates  increased  dramatically:  in  most  provinces,  12  to  15  percent  of  poor\nfamilies  visited  the  health  centers  the  preceding  month,  four  times  the  precrisis  frequencies.\nSurveys  also  show  that  the  proportion  of  births  attended  by  trained  health  personnel  rose\nsharply.  With  aggressive  outreach  programs  to  identify  pregnant  women  and  to  provide\nadequate prenatal care, the proportion of attended births increased substantially, and in some\nprovinces doubled. The decline in nutritional status among pregnant women and young children\nwas  arrested  by  mid-1999  and  has  improved  since.  Overall,  utilization  of  health  services  and\nhealth staff greatly increased during a difficult period when comparable crisis situations in other\ncountries resulted in a decline, rather than an increase in such services.\n\n                                                \n17  Village midwives are generally young women with some prior nursing education who are given one year of training\n\nprior to posting to villages.\n\n18 Loan 1622/1623-INO: Social Protection Sector Development Program (SPSDP), for $300 million, approved in 1998\n(with  50.8  percent  of  the  loan  amount  for  the  health  sector).  Loan  1675/1676-INO:  Health and Nutrition Sector\nDevelopment Program (HNSDP), for $300 million, approved in 1999. The SPSDP and HNSDP are described more\nfully in para. 41.\n\n\f8\n\nAvailable evidence suggests that the JPS-BK has had a positive influence on sustaining\n23. \nessential health services (e.g., maternal and child care programs and immunization). However it\nis too early to assess the full health consequences of the crisis or the mitigating effects of the\nJPS-BK program. Equally, it is too early to assess the impact of crisis interventions on long-term\nhealth  indicators  such  as  MMR,  although  JPS-BK  has  focused  on  the  principal  contributing\nfactors  of  MMR.  But  routinely  collected  data,  special  surveys,  and  anecdotal  information\nsuggest  that  the  impacts  of  the  crisis  have  been  mitigated  and,  in  fact,  crisis-motivated\ninterventions have had a strongly positive influence on the health of women and young children.\nMaintaining  access  of  the  poor  to  basic  health,  nutrition,  and  family  planning  services  is\nessential  to  ensure  their  continued  health  and  productivity.  During  the  crisis,  the  Government\nmaintained resources allocated to essential health services at precrisis levels. However, it used\nmainly external assistance to finance JPS-BK. In the longer term, improved coverage and better\nservice quality will require both a significant increase in resources allocated to the health sector\nand better use of the resources provided. The Government needs to identify new mechanisms\nfor using domestic financial resources to continue protecting the poor in a sustainable way.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1. \n\nHealth Policy and Services\n\nThe  1999  state  guidelines  provide  guidance  for  health  sector  policy.  To  improve  the\n24. \nquality  of  human  resources  and  the  environment,  the  Government  will  emphasize  health\npromotion  and  prevention  of  diseases,  in  combination  with  curative  services,  recovery,  and\nrehabilitation. For better quality health institutions and services, staff will be developed, facilities\nand infrastructure improved, and affordable medicines supplied. Particular attention will be paid\nto  the  poor,  neglected  children,  disabled,  elderly,  and  socially  vulnerable  groups.  Controlling\npopulation growth and raising the quality of the family planning program remain high priority.\n\nHealthy  Indonesia  2010,  developed  in  1999,  describes  MOHSW\u2019s  vision,  strategy,  and\n25. \npolicy.  The  vision  is  to  ensure  that  the  Indonesian  people  live  in  a  healthy  environment  with\nhealthy  living  behavior,  and  obtain  qualified  health  services  that  are  effective,  efficient,  and\nevenly  distributed.  People  must  be  actively  involved  in  maintaining  and  promoting  health,\npreventing diseases, and protecting themselves from them. Efforts will focus on four areas: (i)\ncross-sectoral cooperation, (ii) health staff and public empowerment, (ii) quality and accessibility\nof  health  services,  and  (iv)  prioritization  and  funding  of  health  activities.  Cross-sectoral\ncooperation is important to ensure a healthy environment. Professional management of health\nservices with participation of the community will determine the success of the policy. The health\npolicy should prioritize health promotion and maintenance, and disease prevention. Funding for\nhealth activities should increase, especially for health maintenance and promotion; and curative\nand  rehabilitative  activities  need  to  be  financed  more  by  society.  This  will  require  the\ndevelopment  of  an  efficient,  equitable,  and  participatory  health  prepayment  system  and  better\ncollaboration  with  the  private  sector.  MOHSW  has  defined  four  priority  strategies:  national\ndevelopment  with  health  concerns,  better  professional  qualification,  strengthening  health\nmaintenance insurance, and decentralization.19\n\n                                                \n19 This summary was presented by the minister of health on 18 March 2000 at a seminar on health development in\n\nthe context of decentralization.\n\n\f2. \n\nDecentralization\n\n9\n\n26. \nAlthough decentralization has been on the political agenda for many years, adoption by\nthe Parliament in May 1999 of Law 22 and Law 25 sharply accelerated the process. The laws\nprovide  a  broad  framework  and  define  the  timetable:  decentralization  of  the  Government\u2019s\nservices  and  functions  must  be  implemented  in  2001,  transferring  major  management,\nadministrative,  and  fiscal  responsibilities  mainly  to  the  districts.  District  authorities  and  district\nparliaments  (DPRDs)  will  be  directly  responsible  for  identifying  local  needs,  addressing  local\nissues,  choosing  locally  suitable  solutions,  mobilizing  necessary  resources,  and  implementing\nappropriate  decisions  and  plans  of  action.  In  addition,  all  functions  that  are  not  specifically\nassigned  in  Law  No.  22/99  to  central  and  provincial  levels  automatically  belong  to  districts.\nAlthough  the  legislation  provides  the  broad  framework  for  decentralization,  implementation\nplans have not been finalized, with many regulations still in draft or under discussion, including\nregulations  on  (i)  transfer  of  civil  servants,  assets,  and  spending  authority  to  the  districts;  (ii)\nfiscal  transfer  and  revenue-sharing  arrangements  required  to  finance  transfer  functions;  (iii)\nguidelines  for  local  government  borrowing;  (iv)  accountability  of  local  governments,  financial\nmanagement, and budget procedures; and (v) financial information system.\n\n27. \nUnder decentralization, the roles and functions of the central MOHSW will be limited to\nformulating the national health policy and plans, and assisting the local governments to achieve\nnationwide objectives through resource mobilization and allocation. More specifically, MOHSW\nwill  set  national  standards  and  guidelines  on  nutrition,  medical  education,  food  and  medicine\nquality and distribution, and provincial and district planning, and it will monitor the performance\nof districts and provinces on critical indicators. Districts and provinces will receive block grants\nfrom  the  central  Government,  and  will  be  responsible  for  managing  their  own  health  planning\nand  budgeting  to  reflect  local  needs  and  priorities  and  to  provide  community-oriented  health\nservices.\n\nLocal governments will have more control over finances, planning process, civil service\n28. \norganizations,  and  cooperative  bodies.  Central  ministry  representative  offices  in  the  provinces\nand  districts  will  be  absorbed  into  local  government  structures  under  the  governor  or  bupati.\nBupatis  will  be  fully  autonomous  and  there  will  be  no  hierarchical  relationship  with  provinces.\nThey will function solely as the head of the autonomous district government, and be directly and\nsolely  responsible  to  the  DPRD.  The  district  executive  arm  is  to  be  more  accountable  to  the\ndistrict DPRD, which will elect the bupati and his or her deputies with no interference from the\ncenter.\n\n29. \nThe  Government  is  drafting  regulations  describing  in  detail  criteria  and  formulas  for\nallocating funds from the central Government to local governments, consistent with Law 25/99.\nIn  addition  to  locally  generated  revenues,  local  governments  will  receive  transfers  through  a\nproposed  \u2018equalization  fund.\u2019  Resource  transfers  through  the  equalization  fund  will  have  three\ncomponents:  (i)  shares  of  central  Government  revenues  from  land  and  building  taxes  and\nrevenues  from  natural  resources;  (ii)  a  block  grant  General  Allocation  Fund  (GAF),  based  on\nfactors  including  population  and  poverty  incidence,  that  aims  to  equalize  regional  differences;\nand  (iii)  an  earmarked  Special  Allocation  Fund  (SAF)  allocated  for  specific  programs  or\npurposes  determined  by  the  sectoral  minister.  GAF  aims  to  balance  interregional  financial\ncapacity,  considering  local  revenue  raising  potential,  size  of  the  area,  geographic  conditions,\npopulations, and levels of income. GAF will account for the majority of the funds transferred to\nthe local governments, totaling at least 25 percent of central Government revenues allocated 90\npercent to districts and 10 percent to provinces, as untied block grants. SAF will be allocated to\nsupport projects that fulfill national commitments or priorities or meet special needs. It may not\n\n\f10\n\nbe used for funding administrative costs, training costs, or similar general operating costs. SAF\nallocations  will  be  decided  by  the  technical  ministers  concerned  according  to  availability  of\nresources. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will channel SAF directly into the special account of\nthe region, and the related technical minister will monitor the technical aspects of the project.\n\n30. \nThe Government expects decentralization to be implemented in four general phases: (i)\nan initiating phase (2001) when functions, staff, and assets are transferred, and when the key\nobjective  is  to  ensure  continuity  of  services;  (ii)  a  second  phase  (2002\u20132003)  during  which\ndecentralization  will  be  completed  in  all  regions,  management  functions  strengthened,  and\nbroad  programs  aimed  at  upgrading  staff  skills  undertaken;  (iii)  a  consolidation  phase  (2004\u2013\n2007) during which the decentralization process will be made irreversible and gaps in the legal\nframework corrected; and (iv) a stabilization phase (post-2007) during which regional autonomy\nwill be further strengthened.\n\n3. \n\n Risks and Opportunities of Decentralization\n\nDecentralization  represents  a  major  change\u2013and  challenge\u2013for  the  health  system.\n31. \nAlthough some funds will be earmarked at the central level for specific health activities, the bulk\nof resources for health will have to come from the budget of the district (and a small part from\nthe  budget  of  the  province).  Resource  allocations  among  sectors  will  be  proposed  by  bupatis\nand governors, and approved by district or provincial DPRDs respectively. There is a risk that\nhealth services may not be considered among the priorities because the sector does not bring\nimmediate  measurable  returns.  Strong  and  systematic  advocacy  will  be  needed  to  convince\nlocal decision makers of the need to maintain, and if possible increase, resource allocations for\noperational costs of and investment in health services.\n\n32. \nThe  weak  managerial  capacity  of  local  health  staff  who  are  not  used  to  planning  and\nmanaging  health  services  without  strong  central  direction  creates  a  risk  of  disruption  in  the\nhealth  services  delivery  system.  There  is  a  need  to  strengthen  local  health  staff,  and  also  to\ndevelop  local  technical  expertise  (e.g.,  university  and  domestic  consultants)  to  support  local\nstaff. New regulations in health care financing and in personnel management will force districts\nand  provinces  to  modify  the  local  health  system  and  introduce  health  sector  reforms  that  suit\ntheir local needs and resources. Immediate issues will be related to health services financing.\nSome  poor  districts  will  not  have  the  necessary  resources  to  maintain  basic  health  services.\nGovernment regulations for implementing of Law 25 on Fiscal Balance, providing instructions on\ncost-sharing and resources allocations from the central budget, are still being developed. Until\nthe  districts  (and  provinces)  receive  clear  instructions,  there  will  be  major  uncertainty  in  the\nhealth  sector.  Moreover,  bupatis  and  DPRDs  cannot  make  sensible  allocations  of  local\nresources if they do not know exactly how much resources will be available for their district. The\nsituation is similar at the provincial level.\n\n33. \nThe  poor  and  women  may  be  seriously  affected  by  decentralization.  Public  health\nservices may be disrupted for several reasons: (i) decreased resources for local health services\nbecause  the  health  sector  may  be  given  lower  priority  in  allocation  by  local  parliaments;  (ii)\nfunding  may  focus  on  curative  health  care  rather  than  on  primary  health  care,  improved\nmaternal health, and nutrition programs; and (iii) lack of experience of local health staff in health\nservices planning and management. If public health services do not function normally, better-off\npeople would probably turn to private health providers; the poor do not have that option. These\nrisks are compounded by the fact that SPSDP and HNSDP, which funded JPS-BK, are closing\nin  2001.  New  and  locally  appropriate  mechanisms  are  needed  to  fund  and  implement\n\n\f11\n\ncommunity  outreach  programs  to  ensure  health  care  for  the  poor,  safe  motherhood,  and\nnutrition support for malnourished pregnant and lactating women and children under five years.\n\n34. \nPersonnel  is  another  issue  that  local  governments  will  have  to  address  rapidly.  About\nthree quarters of all civil servants are central Government employees, but less than 10 percent\nare physically located in the capital. Under decentralization, central Government employees in\ndistricts and provinces are to be transferred to local government payrolls. This may create initial\nproblems, as central Government staff tend to hold managerial positions desired by local staff.\nIn  addition,  there  is  a  major  risk  that  districts,  especially  more  remote  districts,  will  lose\nexperienced  personnel  either  because  financial  incentives  are  not  satisfactory  or  because\nopportunities for career progression in the district are limited.\n\n35.  While districts are the main focus of decentralization, some medical problems are more\neffectively and cost-efficiently addressed through coordination among neighboring districts and\nsometimes  between  provinces.  Public  health  issues,  particularly  infectious  diseases  such  as\nmalaria and tuberculosis, are not limited by administrative boundaries and coordination across\ndistricts is essential to control them. Districts\u2013now autonomous and no longer subordinate to the\nprovinces  according  to  the  law\u2013and  provinces  will  have  to  develop  mechanisms  that  ensure\ncoordination and effectiveness.\n\nDecentralization, however, also offers tremendous opportunities. With local parliaments\n36. \nand local administrative and technical staff responsible for resource allocation, local needs can\nbe given priority. Health services should be able to better answer the demands of the population\nwith  locally  adapted  solutions  and  increased  efficiency.  The  beneficiaries  also  will  be  in  direct\ncontact  with  those  who  make  the  decisions.  Greater  beneficiary  involvement  should  improve\ntransparency. Health sector reforms will have a better chance to succeed because they will be\ndecided  locally,  based  on  local  circumstances,  and  will  no  longer  be  imposed  from  Jakarta,\nuniformly  for  all  regions.  Finally,  mobilization  of  new  financial  resources  for  health  may  be\neasier. Resources will not be pooled at a national level, with little opportunity for the prospective\nbeneficiaries  to  decide  on  their  use.  With  decisions  on  the  use  of  the  resources  made  locally,\nlocal resources should be more easily mobilized.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n37. \nBetween  1994  and  1997,  external  assistance  to  the  health  sector  was  estimated  at\nabout $573.11 million. The main sources of assistance were the World Bank, ADB, Japan Bank\nfor  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\n(USAID), Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the Netherlands, and the\nspecialized  United  Nations  (UN)  agencies:  UN  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  UN\nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  UN  Population  Fund  (UNFPA),  and  World  Health  Organization\n(WHO). External assistance supported mainly activities in nutrition, community health, women\u2019s\nhealth, and family planning.\n\n38. \nThe  World  Bank  has  funded  seven  health  projects  in  Indonesia  since  1992.  The  Third\nCommunity  Health  and  Population  Project  (1993-1998)  promoted  decentralized  health\nmanagement,  and  the  Fourth  Health  Project  (approved  in  1995)  supported  the  shift  to\nautonomous  district-level  budgeting  and  encouraged  adoption  of  quality  assurance.  The  Iodine\nDeficiency  Control  (1997),  Safe  Motherhood  (1998),  and  Early  Childhood  Development  (1999)\nprojects focused on vulnerable groups, women, and children. The Fifth Health Project (1999) aims\nat  improving  health  personnel  management  and  utilization,  health  staff  training,  and  quality\nassurance.\n\n\f12\n\n39. \nThe most recent World Bank project, approved in June 2000, the Provincial Health Project\n(PHP),  is  particularly  relevant  for  the  Project.  PHP  covers  two  provinces:  Lampung  and\nYogyakarta.  PHP  processing  started  in  1997  but  was  interrupted  by  the  economic  crisis.  The\noriginal approach was to improve health services in the project provinces, emphasizing the role\nof the provincial governments, but when the decentralization laws were approved in April 1999,\nPHP  was  restructured  to  take  the  new  social  and  political  context  into  consideration.  ADB\ncoordinated  closely  with  the  PHP  team  since  PHP  and  the  Project  have  a  broadly  similar\napproach:  an  initial  period  of  local  capacity  building  with  locally  developed  sector  investment\nplans confirmed at the end of the capacity building period, and an investment phase. The main\ndifference  is  that  the  Project  emphasizes  the  districts  while  PHP  relies  more  on  provincial\ncoordination and management.\n\n40. \nSince  1985,  ADB  has  financed  five  loan  projects  in  the  health  and  population  sector\n(Appendix  3).  The  Health  and  Population  Project20  and  the  Second  Health  and  Population\nProject21  aimed  to  strengthen  delivery  of  health  care  and  clinical  family  planning  services  by\nexpanding  and  upgrading  physical  infrastructure  (hospitals  and  training  facilities).  The  Rural\nHealth  and  Population  Project22  aims  to  upgrade  rural  health  services  in  the  district,  and\nstrengthen the referral system from the health center to the district hospital in selected provinces\nin Sumatra by improving the rural health and family planning delivery system. The Rural Health\nand  Population  Project  supported  capacity  building,  refined  the  integrated  health  planning  and\nbudgeting system, and promoted the development of financially autonomous hospitals and health\ncenters in the project districts. The Family Health and Nutrition Project23 focuses on expanding the\nparticipation  of  families  and  communities  in  identifying  their  health  needs  and  priorities,  and\nincreasing  service  quality  by  helping  local  health  staff  to  improve  their  skills  and  adopt  a  client-\noriented approach. The project focuses on poor families in less developed villages. The Intensified\nCommunicable Disease Control Project24 aims to improve control of infectious diseases (malaria,\ntuberculosis, respiratory infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases) that particularly affect the\npoor  through  strengthened  program  management  at  district  and  provincial  levels.  Two  advisory\nTAs25  provided  useful  background  information  on  resource  mobilization  and  reorganization  of\nMOHSW and the health system.\n\nIn  1998  and  1999,  ADB  approved  two  sector  development  programs,  SPSDP  and\n41. \nHNSDP, to address emergency issues arising from the economic crisis. Their objective was to\nmitigate  the  effects  of  the  economic  crisis  on  the  poor.  The  specific  objectives  of  SPSDP,\ncovering health and education and initially limited to eight provinces, were to (i) protect access\nby  vulnerable  groups  to  essential  social  services;  (ii)  maintain  the  quality  of  social  services  to\nthe  poor;  and  (iii)  initiate  sustainable  policy  reforms  related  to  the  provision  of  key  social\nservices. The objectives of HNSDP were similar, but focused on the health sector and extended\n\n                                                \n20 Loan 743-INO: Health and Population Project, for $41.6 million, approved on 17 October 1985; closed on 30 June\n\n21 Loan 926-INO: Second Health and Population Project, for $39.3 million, approved on 29 November 1988; closed\n\n22 Loan 1299-INO: Rural Health and Population Project, for $40 million, approved on 26 May 1994; expected to close\n\n1993.\n\non 31 March 1995.\n\n31 December 2000.\n\n23 Loan 1471-INO: Family Health and Nutrition Project, for $45 million, approved on 27 September 1996; due to be\n\ncompleted on 31 March 2002.\n\n24 Loan 1523-INO: Intensified Communicable Diseases Control Project, for $87.4 million, approved on 19 June 1997;\n\ndue to be completed on 31 December 2003.\n\n25 TA 2221-INO: Resource Mobilization and Budgeting for Decentralized Health Services, for $600,000, approved on\n5  December  1994;  and  completed  in  September  1996.  TA  2814-INO: Capacity Building of Ministry of Health for\nStrategic Planning, for $800,000, approved on 19 June 1997; completed in March 1999.\n\n\f13\n\nproject coverage to all provinces: to (i) protect access of vulnerable groups to essential health,\nnutrition, and family planning services; (ii) maintain the quality of services to the poor; and (iii)\ninitiate  feasible  and  implementable  policy  reforms  related  to  sustainable  health  and  nutrition\nservice  delivery.  The  policy  priorities  under  the  two  loans  provided  a  framework  for  policy\ndialogue during project preparation.\n\nthe \n\ntwo \n\nloans  developed  before \n\nJPS-BK  was  set  up  to  address  the  need  to  protect  access  of  the  poor  to  essential\n42. \nservices.  However, \nlaws  on\ndecentralization,  strongly  emphasized  the  need  to  decentralize  health  services  and  increase\nlocal  participation  and  transparency.  The  loans  (i)  developed  new  disbursement  mechanisms\n(through block grants directly to the beneficiaries) conceptually similar to the block allocations to\nthe districts prescribed by the laws; (ii) started a capacity-building program in the provinces and,\nin particular, helped implement the utilization of integrated health planning and budgeting (IHPB)\nin  all  districts;  (iii)  supported  training  related  to  IHPB,  and  (iv)  developed  participation  of  the\ncommunity and NGOs in implementing and monitoring activities.\n\nthe  enactment  of \n\nthe \n\nBecause  the  potential  problems  of  decentralization  of  health  services  are  of  major\n43. \nconcern, all aid agencies involved in the health sector are participating in efforts to strengthen\nlocal  capacity  and  assist  local  governments  to  identify  needs,  develop  and  implement\nappropriate  reforms,  and  make  adequate  and  cost-efficient  investments.  Some  agencies  are\nsupporting  specific  provinces  and  districts,  others  are  involved  at  the  national  level,  assisting\nMOHSW in policy and administrative issues. The programs of the UN agencies (WHO, UNFPA,\nUNICEF)  have  been  reoriented  to  answer  the  immediate  needs  of  decentralization.  The\nGovernment  of  the  Netherlands  has  committed  $120.0  million  grant  for  the  health  sector,\nchanneled through WHO. German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is involved in strengthening the\nhealth system in the districts of West Nusa Tenggara Province. JBIC is supporting pilot projects\nand  procurement  of  medical  equipment  in  selected  districts  of  Sulawesi.  In  August  2000,  the\nGovernment  of  Australia  fielded  a  prefeasibility  study  mission  to  examine  how  to  more\nsystematically  support  decentralization  in  the  health  sector.  AusAID  and  ADB  have  been\ncollaborating closely during preparation of this Project.\n\n44. \nCoordination among aid agencies strongly developed during the economic crisis, and is\nmaintained  to  assist  MOHSW  better  address  policy  issues  and  reforms,  particularly  issues\nrelated  to  decentralization.  Several  mechanisms  facilitate  coordination.  ADB,  WHO,  the  World\nBank,  USAID,  and  AusAID  are  meeting  regularly  since  November  1999  as  a  group  called\nPartners  in  Health.  Other  aid  agencies  are  welcome  to  participate.  A  ministerial  decree  of  the\nminister of health created in early 2000 a policy advisory group directly reporting to the minister.\nThe  group  includes  senior  advisers  to  the  ministers  and  representatives  from  ADB,  the  World\nBank,  WHO,  and  JPIEGO.26  Agency  coordination  is  also  maintained  through  regular  meetings\non health and safe motherhood, initiated by WHO, and hosted by each aid agency in turn. The\nProject  itself  has  been  developed  in  coordination  with  the  World  Bank  team  who  worked  on\nPHP. Close collaboration was established with the Government of Australia (AusAID), and other\nsources (WHO, GTZ) were actively consulted.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n45.  Many  lessons  were  derived  from  SPSDP  and  HNSDP.  Close  partnership  and  policy\ndialogue with the Government ensured trustful relations that facilitated and accelerated project\n\n                                                \n26  Originally  the  Johns  Hopkins  University  Program  for  International  Education  in  Gynecology  and  Obstetrics,\n\nJHPIEGO now has a broader reproductive health agenda, not limited to gynecology and obstetrics.\n\n\f14\n\ndesign  and  implementation.  The  demand  for  targeting  of  Government  resources  imposed  a\nstrict  definition  of  the  beneficiaries  and  quantitative  targets.  New  disbursement  mechanisms\nwere implemented; they proved efficient and accelerated disbursement Finally, implementation\nof an independent monitoring system based on the community and using NGOs was very useful\nin increasing confidence among the beneficiaries. This parallel monitoring, however, may not be\nsustainable without external support.\n\n46. \nThe  previous  ADB  projects,  completed  and  still  under  implementation,  also  yielded\nuseful  lessons  that  were  utilized  in  processing  the  Project.  Most  important  is  the  need  for  a\nsense  of  project  ownership  by  the  end-users,  and  for  bottom-up  planning.  Project  processing\nhas been a gradual process as ADB and MOHSW gave the districts and the provinces time to\nidentify their needs by themselves and to develop their own proposals. International consultants\nwere used for general support and broad sector analysis, but local staff developed the regional\nproposals,  with  limited  support  from  domestic  consultants.  Another  lesson  is  the  need  for\nflexibility  in  project  implementation.  The  main  recommendations  of  the  World  Bank  team  for\nPHP  were  to  fully  involve  the  districts  or  provinces  and  let  them  identify  their  needs  and\npriorities,  and  to  ensure  flexibility  in  the  project  design.  The  Project\u2019s  main  characteristic  is  its\nprocess-oriented  approach  and  flexibility  to  better  answer  local  needs.  Communication\n(telephone,  fax,  e-mail,  etc.)  is  very  important  to  address  logistical  issues  quickly,  but  also  to\nshare  experiences  and  provide  peer \ninitiated  a\ncommunication network among the districts, provinces, MOHSW, and ADB, using the Internet,\nand  has  supported  creation  of  a  web  site  focusing  on  decentralization  issues  in  the  health\nsector.\n\ntechnical  support.  The  Project  has \n\nLessons  from  postevaluated  projects  clearly  indicate  the  need  for  sustained  efforts.\n47. \nBecause  of  the  long  program  cycle  needed  for  sustained  development  in  the  health  sector,  a\nseries of overlapping projects with consistent core objectives is necessary to make an impact on\nkey  indicators  while  strengthening  government  capacity  to  manage  the  health  sector.  This\nProject should be considered the first of a series of decentralized capacity building in the project\narea. Subsequent projects should build on the experience of this Project.\n\nE. \n\nADB Sector Strategy\n\n48. \nADB\u2019s  overall  approach  to  the  health  sector  is  to  assist  governments  of  developing\nmember  countries  (DMCs)  in  assuring  their  citizens  of  broad  access  to  basic  preventive,\npromotive,  and  curative  services  that  are  efficacious,  cost-effective,  and  affordable.  ADB\u2019s\npolicy  for  the  health  sector27  highlights  the  need  to  address  key  issues:  (i)  health  of  the  poor,\nwomen,  and  indigenous  people;  (ii)  setting  clear  priorities  to  ensure  the  most  efficient  use  of\nresources;  (iii)  mobilizing  resources  for  the  public  health  sector;  (iv)  building  managerial\ncapacity;  (v)  testing  innovative  approaches;  (vi)  introducing  effective  new  technologies;  (vii)\nfocusing  on  functions  that  constitute  public  good;  and  (viii)  encouraging  collaboration  between\npublic and private health  service providers.\n\nThe  Country  Operational  Strategy  (COS)  for  Indonesia28  identifies  the  health  sector  as\n49. \none of the key sectors on which ADB will focus its capacity building support for decentralization.\nHealth  must  remain  at  the  top  of  the  agenda  for  local  governments  and  communities.  If  the\nhealth sector is neglected, the poor and the vulnerable groups will be the first and main victims\nof  deteriorating  public  health  services,  with  long-lasting  impact  on  their  health  status  and  their\n\n                                                \n27 Policy for the Health Sector  (February 1999).\n28 The COS, currently under preparation, is scheduled for Board consideration in January 2001.\n\n\f15\n\nphysical and intellectual capacity. This conclusion is also valid for family planning and nutrition\nservices.  The  rapid  implementation  of  decentralization  prevents  systematic  and  progressive\nbuilding  of  the  capacity  of  and  technical  skills  of  local  health  staff.  However,  decentralization\nalso offers opportunities to better adapt local health services to local needs and to ensure true\ncommunity participation in maintaining and improving health status.\n\n50. \nThe immediate issue for the health sector in Indonesia is to protect access to essential\nhealth services by the poor and vulnerable groups, and to build a nationwide health safety net\nprogram incorporating the proven elements of the JPS-BK program. JPS-BK must be improved\nto ensure better targeting of limited public resources, mobilization of other resources for health,\nand  improved  cost-efficiency  of  the  health  service  delivery  system.  Nutrition,  reproductive\nhealth,  and  communicable  disease  control  will  remain  essential  components  as  the  poor  and\nvulnerable  groups  (women,  children)  will  be  the  first  beneficiaries.  While  the  need  to  maintain\nand  improve  physical  infrastructure  and  equipment  there  will  remain,  the  major  issues  to  be\naddressed  now  are  to  locally  adapt  health  services  and  introduce  required  reforms  in  health\ncare  financing,  public-private  sector  partnership,  staff  management,  etc.  Skill  building,  both  in\nclinical  expertise  and  management  (including  evaluation  and  planning),  is  and  will  remain  a\npriority.\n\n51. \nConsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  health  sector  strategy,  investment  in  primary  health  care\n(including  family  planning,  reproductive  health,  and  nutrition)  is  another  priority.  Health  sector\nreforms  to  improve  efficiency  and  effectiveness  will  be  essential,  including  better  targeting  of\npublic  resources,  resources  mobilization  for  health,  public-private  partnership,  health  services\nfinancing,  staff  management  (incentives,  career,  training,  etc.).  Projects  must  also  answer  the\nneeds identified by the local communities and local governments.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nFrom early support to expand physical infrastructure, ADB has progressed to emphasize\n52. \nhealth system reform and improved efficiency and effectiveness in health services delivery. ADB\u2019s\nhealth  sector  strategy,  focusing  on  primary  health  care,  provides  a  clear  framework  for  policy\ndialogue and long-term investment. During the 1990s, ADB dialogue and support shifted to health\nservices  organization  and  management,  and  health  staff  development.  The  referral  system  and\nthe links between the health centers and the district hospital were strengthened under the Rural\nHealth  and  Population  Project  (footnote  22).  ADB  has  promoted  delegation  of  functions  and\nresponsibility  to  districts  and  provinces  under  the  Intensified  Communicable  Diseases  Control\nProject  (footnote  24),  as  an  initial  step  toward  decentralization.  ADB  supported  better\ncoordination between the various services and programs, and insisted on increased participation of\nthe  beneficiaries.  With  the  Family  Health  and  Nutrition  Project  (footnote  23),  families  and  the\ncommunities were targeted as beneficiaries and active participants. In reproductive health and\nfamily  planning,  ADB\u2019s  policy  has  been  to  work  together  with  BKKBN  and  MOHSW  to  ensure\nintegration of family planning and reproductive health in the health services.\n\n53. \nDuring the crisis, ADB supported the Government\u2019s efforts to rapidly develop a safety net\nand protect access to and availability of essential services for the population, especially the poor.\nDialogue  among  ADB,  the  Government,  MOHSW,  and  BKKBN  was  particularly  intensive  and\nfruitful  during  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  SPSDP  and  HNSDP  policy  matrices.  The\nsector development programs (SDPs) focused on six aspects of the health system: (i) access of\nvulnerable  groups  to  essential  health  services;  (ii)  mobilization  of  additional  resources  to  support\nhealth,  nutrition,  and  family  planning  services;  (iii)  quality  of  health  services;  (iv)  decentralization,\ncommunity participation, and transparency; (v) MOHSW and health system organizational changes\n\n\f16\n\nand development; and (vi) improving efficiency of resource use. The SPSDP and HNSDP policy\nmatrices  helped  protect  the  health  budget  and  reorient  resources  to  primary  health  care  and\nservices most used by the poor and vulnerable groups. Delegation of tasks and accountability to\ndistricts  and  provinces  proved  useful  in  preparing  for  decentralization.  New  transfer  mechanisms\nwere  developed  to  facilitate  use  of  funds  directly  by  the  beneficiaries.  In  parallel,  a  monitoring\nsystem  developed  in  collaboration  with  the  Government  and  other  aid  agencies  showed  how\ninvolvement of the community and civil society can improve transparency and accountability, and\nincrease efficiency. All these issues remain priorities in the present context, and the SDPs\u2019 policy\nthrough  project  processing\nrecommendations  have  been \ndiscussions.\n\nfurther  developed  and  refined \n\n54. \nThe  evolution  of  ADB  policy  dialogue  and  linkages  with  the  Project  are  summarized  in\nAppendix  4.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  emphasizes  access  and  service  delivery,  focusing  on  the\nneeds  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  ADB  project  coverage  has  focused  on  poor  areas,\nand  investments  have  focused  on  primary  health  care  services  and  public  health  issues.  The\nprimary  objectives  of  SPSDP  and  HNSDP  were  to  protect  access  to  essential  health  services\nfor  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  During  implementation  of  the  SDPs,  regular  reports  were\nsubmitted by NGOs on access and delivery of health care services to the poor.29 Identifying the\nreal  poor  is  an  essential  feature  of  the  safety  net  program.  The  updated  information  was  very\nuseful during project preparation. Moreover, actual implementation of these activities in the field\nhas modified the attitudes and priorities of local authorities and local health staff.\n\nrequires  ADB \n\n55.  With the implementation of decentralization, policy dialogue takes a new turn. Relations\nhave  long  been  established  between  ADB  and  MOHSW  and  BKKBN  in  the  health  sector,  but\nto  dialogue  more  directly  with  district  and  province\ndecentralization \nrepresentatives.  Visiting  districts  and  provinces,  and  establishing  new  contacts  are  time-\nconsuming, and project processing and administration will have to take this aspect into account.\nHowever,  the  benefits  of  more  direct  dialogue  with  beneficiaries  and  their  immediate\nrepresentatives  are  potentially  significant.  Dialogue  on  the  need  for  reform  and  collaboration\nwith private not-for-profit health organizations is easier with direct reference to the local situation\nthan in the abstract. Introducing a health insurance system with specific measures to protect the\npoor and target public resources to the poor is easier to discuss with decision makers when they\nrealize  that  the  scheme  will  be  adapted  to  the  local  context  and  not  imposed  for  the  whole\ncountry by Jakarta. This important policy dialogue at the district and province level, however, is\njust  starting  and  may  take  some  time  to  yield  all  the  potential  benefits.  This  aspect  was\nconsidered in designing the Project.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n56. \nThe  poor  and  the  vulnerable  groups,  women  in  particular,  are  most  affected  when\nessential public health services are not provided satisfactorily. Because the public health sector\nis the main health service provider in many rural areas, any disruption in public health services\ndelivery  will  seriously  affect  the  local  population.  While  better-off  families  may  find  alternative\nhealth  service  providers  in  the  private  sector,  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  groups  are  most  at\n\n                                                \n29 These  activities  have  been  financed  through  TA  3175-INO:  Monitoring and Evaluating the Health and Nutrition\nSector Development Program,  for  $1  million,  approved  on  25  March  1999;  attached  to  HNSDP.  TA  3041:\nMonitoring and Evaluating the Social Protection Sector Development Program, for $2.5 million, approved on 9 July\n1998; attached to SPSDP, has concentrated on the education sector.\n\n\f17\n\nrisk.  With  the  start  of  decentralization  on  1  January  2001,  maintaining  functioning  and\naccessible essential services is a Government priority.\n\n57. \nIt  is  essential  to  continue  policy  dialogue  with  local  authorities  and  provide  necessary\ntechnical  support  to  help  maintain  protection  of  the  poor  and  their  access  to  quality  health\nservices. With decentralization, decisions will be made at the district level, by the DPRD and the\nbupati,  based  on  advice  and  report  from  local  staff  and,  hopefully,  with  participation  of  the\npopulation. The district authorities, the health staff who advise them, and the community and its\nrepresentatives have not been adequately prepared for taking these responsibilities. They need\nto  acquire  the  necessary  understanding  and  skills  to  make  appropriate  choices.  The\nresponsibility  of  the  district  governments  and  local  health  staff  is  no  longer  limited  to\nimplementing  policy  and  enforcing  regulations,  but  now  requires  effective  health  service\nmanagement. Both policy and management require specific information and skills that were not\nnecessary  for  local  authorities  when  the  system  was  centrally  managed,  but  have  become\ncrucial with decentralization.\n\nAllocation  of  public  resources  by  district  authorities  is  one  of  the  most  important  tools\n58. \nthat  ensure  real  power  to  local  governments.  Health  and  family  planning  must  remain  among\nthe  priorities  of  district  governments.  And  within  the  health  sector,  protecting  access  to  health\nservices  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  must  take  precedence  in  resource  allocation:\nresources  have  to  be  targeted  to  the  poor  rather  than  spread  in  the  system.  This  must  be\njustified and explained to decision makers at the local level. There is also a need to develop the\ntechnical  skills  necessary  for  efficient  and  cost-effective  allocation  of  available  resources.\nDecentralization  offers  great  opportunities  to  identify  and  better  address  local  needs  in  health\nand family planning, to more effectively target resources to the real poor and vulnerable groups\nin  the  community,  and  to  introduce  locally  suitable  reforms  in  the  system.  But  these\nopportunities can only be taken and can benefit the local populations if local capacity to collect\nand analyze information locally is strengthened.\n\n59. \nThe Indonesian health system must also improve its performance as reflected in health\nindicators. Indonesia\u2019s poor performances compared with that of neighboring countries, and the\ndifferences  between  provinces  and  districts  indicate  that  major  improvements  are  possible.\nThese changes can be expected with appropriate health sector reforms and investments in the\nphysical infrastructure, equipment, and human resources.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n60. \nThe  project  goal  is  to  improve  the  health  status  of  the  population  in  all  districts  of  the\nproject  area  by  improving  access,  delivery  and  quality  of  health  and  family  planning  services,\nwith special attention to the poor and vulnerable groups. In the context of decentralization, the\nobjectives are to (i) strengthen local capacity in health services delivery, including planning and\nmanagement;  and  (ii)  improve  quality,  cost-efficiency,  and  sustainability  of  health  and  family\nplanning services in the project area.\n\nTo  improve  health  and  family  planning  services,  the  Project  will  take  the  opportunity\n61. \noffered by decentralization to better involve representatives of the local communities, including\nthe  poor,  women,  and  vulnerable  groups.  They  will  participate  in  deciding  and  implementing\nappropriate  managerial  and  organizational  changes  and  in  prioritizing  investment  in  the  local\nhealth and family planning sector based on their own assessment, with the technical support of\nhealth  and  BKKBN  staff.  By  emphasizing  the  need  for  better  targeting  of  public  resources  to\n\n\f18\n\nvulnerable  groups  and  wide  consultation  in  decision  making,  the  Project  will  help  strengthen\nequity and develop consumer choice.\n\n62. \nThe  Project  will  cover  all  districts  (50)  and  cities  (12)  in  seven  provinces:  Aceh,  Bali,\nBengkulu,  Riau,  Central  Sulawesi,  North  Sulawesi,  and  Southeast  Sulawesi.30  All  districts  will\nparticipate  in  the  Project  to  facilitate  coordination  and  effectively  address  health  issues  that\nextend  beyond  the  district  boundary.  For  this  reason,  only  provinces  with  a  limited  number  of\ndistricts were selected for the Project. The main criterion for selection was a clear commitment\nfrom the district and provincial government to seriously address health sector issues.\n\n63. \nThe project provinces and districts are diverse in sociocultural traditions, geography, and\nresource base. Aceh is a conservative province. Women's participation rate in the labor force is\nlow, and fertility rate is high. Ethnically distinct indigenous people live in the central highlands.\nWith  decentralization,  revenues  from  natural  gas  should  provide  good  resources  to  the  local\ngovernments.  Bali  enjoys  significant  revenue  from  tourism.  With  decentralization,  tourism  tax\nrevenues  will  not  be  shared  with  the  other  regions.  There  is  scope  for  private  for-profit  health\nservices, but not in all districts. Paradoxically, local governments in Bali may have problems in\nadequately  addressing  health  and  environmental  problems  (such  as  water  supply  and\nsanitation),  especially  in  poor  communities  away  from  the  tourist  areas.  Bengkulu,  an  isolated\nprovince with limited resource tax base, was severely hit by an earthquake in June 2000. Riau\nhas  a  rich  tax  base  from  oil  fields  on  the  mainland  and  a  dynamic  industrial  zone  on  Batam\nIsland off Singapore. But the province also has large areas of peat swamp characterized by low\nfertility  and  difficult  access,  and  small  isolated  islands  in  the  Riau  archipelago  between  the\nisland of Sumatra, Singapore, and Kalimantan. Indigenous people are found in the mountainous\nhighlands  along  the  central  Sumatra  mountain  range  and  in  the  Riau  archipelago.  North\nSulawesi  has  an  active  private  not-for-profit  health  sector.  While  some  parts  of  the  province\nhave  relatively  prosperous  communities,  others  are  very  poor.  Central  Sulawesi  has  a  limited\ntax base and small, scattered communities along the narrow coastal strips and in the highland\nareas.  It  is  the  most  ethnically  and  linguistically  complex  province  after  Irian  Jaya.  Southeast\nSulawesi comprises a mix of old communities and new settlements. The province is a receiving\narea of the overflow from land-short and historically disaster-prone South Sulawesi, and recently\nsaw a significant increase of internally displaced persons from Maluku.\n\n64. \nThe  project  area  is  diverse  in  the  resource  base  available  to  local  governments  for\nproviding  services,  types  of  communities,  and  existing  infrastructure.  It  will  provide  a  range  of\nmodels  for  resource-rich  and  resource-poor  local  governments  to  address  the  needs  of\nrelatively  poor  and  nonpoor  communities.  All  project  provinces  are  covered  by  SPSDP  and\nHNSDP  (footnote  18).  Aceh  and  Riau  have  participated  in  the  Rural  Health  and  Population\nProject  (footnote  22),  and  Bengkulu  is  included  in  the  Family  Health  and  Nutrition  Project\n(footnote 23).\n\n1. \n\nProject Components\n\n65. \nThe Project will consist of four components: (i) advocacy and capacity building, (ii) health\nsector  reforms;  (iii)  investments  in  health  and  family  planning  services;  and  (iv)  project\nmanagement, including implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.\n\n                                                \n30 Other provinces are or will be covered by other aid agencies, particularly the World Bank, GTZ, WHO, and AusAid.\n\n\f19\n\na. \n\nAdvocacy and Capacity Building\n\n66. \nInitial project activities will include advocacy and information campaigns to local decision\nmakers  (bupatis  and  governors),  the  community,  professional  staff  from  other  sectors,  and\nhealth  staff,  on  decentralization  of  health  services,  social  impact,  gender  and  health,  and\nparticipatory  governance.  Capacity  building  will  start  immediately  to  answer  an  urgent  need.\nCapable  and  skilled  professionals  constitute  the  indispensable  foundation  in  developing  and\nmaintaining  an  efficient  and  equitable  health  system.  Capacity  building  will  include  formal\ntraining,  workshops,  and  study  tours.  The  training  program,  intensive  during  the  first  year,  will\ncover  management  and  good  governance:  data  analysis  to  identify  local  needs;  prioritization\nand  targeting;  participatory  planning;  budgeting,  accountability,  and  transparency;  social  and\nenvironmental  impact  assessments;  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Training  activities  will\ncontinue throughout project implementation. Medical and technical skills will be upgraded.\n\n67.  With  the  use  of  available  information,  field  visits,  and  analysis  of  the  preliminary\nproposals submitted by districts, a two-part training program has been developed. To address\ncommon needs, a standard training program has been prepared for all Project areas (Appendix\n5). Funds will also be allocated for other training activities based on needs identified locally that\nmay vary among districts and provinces. Training participants will include health staff and other\ncivil servants, and representatives of the private sector and civil society as appropriate. For all\ntraining activities, female candidates will be given priority with a view of achieving the target of\n50  percent  of  female  participation  in  each  category  of  training  activities.  Study  tours,  short\ncourses, and academic studies will be subject to approval by ADB.\n\nAs  much  as  possible,  training  will  be  provided  on  site.  Trainers  will  be  selected  from\n68. \namong MOHSW and BKKBN staff, the private sector and NGOs, professional organizations and\nteaching institutions, consultants and other stakeholders. Training activities will be competency\nbased,  relying  on  experience  and  case  study,  and  using  quality  information,  education,  and\ncommunication material. The Project will help developing collaboration among local universities\nand  teaching  institutions  with  expertise  in  public  health.  Investment  in  information  technology\n(Internet  connections  and  distance  learning/support)  will  establish  a  network  facilitating\nexchange of information and experiences.\n\n69. \nThe  Project  will  support  operation  research  studies  that  will  cover  performance\nmonitoring and evaluation, health service organization, human resource management, impact of\ndecentralization, health information system, and development of an information network system\namong  regions.  These  studies  will  be  proposed  by  the  districts,  provinces,  or  at  central  level,\nconsolidated by MOHSW and submitted to ADB for approval. The findings will be reviewed by\nthe  districts,  provinces,  and  the  central  level  and  taken  into  consideration  in  preparing  and\nimplementing  local  health  sector  reforms.  Domestic  firms  or  academic  institutions  will  be\nrecruited for operational research studies.\n\nb. \n\nAdapting Health Services to Local Needs\n\nInitially  the  Project  will  support  consulting  services  for  local  health  sector  analysis  and\n70. \nidentification  of  locally  suitable  reforms  of  the  health  system,  based  on  national  guidelines.\nVarious  aspects  of  the  health  system  will  be  reviewed:  the  particular  needs  of  the  poor  and\nvulnerable  groups,  health  care  financing,  better  targeting  of  public  resources,  streamlining  of\nstaff  and  staff  development,  role  of  the  private  sector  (for-profit  and  not  for-profit),  and  public-\nprivate partnership. The existing data collection system and reporting requirements, developed\nto answer the needs of a highly centralized system, will need to be adapted to assist the district\n\n\f20\n\nauthorities and health staff. Subsequently, the Project will support the implementation of locally\nidentified priority reforms.\n\n71. \nPriority  will  be  given  to  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  groups,\nparticularly  in  designing  mechanisms  to  sustain  an  efficient  health  safety  net  program.  The\nProject will help local authorities transform JPS-BK into a sustainable program, maintaining its\nbenefits and addressing issues observed during program implementation. Public resources for\nhealth must initially be maintained at least at the existing levels, but local governments need to\nfind ways of mobilizing new resources in accordance with the national policy.\n\nc. \n\nInvestment in Health and Family Planning\n\nSignificant  progress  in  health  and  nutrition  status  can  be  achieved  rapidly  with\n72. \nappropriate  investments  in  health  facilities,  equipment,  and  personnel  to  increase  service\nquality.  The  Project  will  help  restore  an  effective  and  efficient  health  services  delivery  system\nthrough  judicious  and  cost-efficient  investments  in  health  and  family  planning  services,  based\non local needs. The Project will finance clinical and managerial training, consulting services, civil\nworks, equipment and material, and operational research.\n\n73. \nParticipating districts and provinces developed preliminary proposals for civil works and\nequipment  for  health  centers,  district  hospitals,  and  local  training  centers.  The  proposals,  with\ntechnical inputs  and costing from MOHSW, served as the basis for the Project cost estimates\nand the indicative procurement packages to be financed by the Project.\n\nd. \n\nProject Management\n\n74. \nThe  project  focus  is  on  developing  local  capacity  at  the  district  and  province  levels  to\nprepare  and  implement  health  sector  development  plans  and  to  manage  health  services\ndelivery. It is necessary for the district and provincial health offices to be directly involved in, and\nresponsible  for,  project  implementation  to  the  extent  possible.  Realistically,  however,  the\ndistricts  and  provinces  will  require  substantial  strengthening  and  support  before  they  can\ndischarge  these  tasks  effectively.  Because  of  a  relatively  weak  local  capacity  and  lack  of\nexperience  in  decision  making  and  project  management,  strong  support  is  needed  for  project\nmanagement.\n\n75. \nFunds will be allocated to support implementation at the district, provincial, and central\nlevels. Project funds will be used to finance the services of project management staff recruited\nunder  contract  where  needed.  Individual  domestic  and  international  consultants  and  domestic\nconsulting firms will provide technical support. Regular and intensive supervision and contacts\nbetween districts, provinces, and the central level will be important to prevent mistakes that are\nlikely to happen with inexperienced staff. The Project will also support independent auditing, and\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  using  technical  expertise  of  health  professionals  and  active\nparticipation  of  civil  society.  Lessons  and  experience  from  the  JPS-BK  program  will  be\nreviewed,  and  independent  monitoring  system  developed  under  HNSDP  will  be  adapted  as\nappropriate.\n\n2. \n\nProject Implementation Strategy\n\nTo achieve its objectives, the Project will be implemented in a phased manner over five\n76. \nyears.  During  the  first  phase,  the  Project  will  build  community  support  for  health  and  family\nplanning  in  the  districts  through  advocacy  and  information  campaigns,  and  will  strengthen\n\n\f21\n\ntechnical  skills  of  health  staff  to  identify  local  needs  and  to  prepare  comprehensive  sector\ndevelopment plans incorporating appropriate investments and reforms. In the second phase, the\nProject  will  finance  investments  in  health  and  family  planning,  and  support  implementation  of\nlocally  adapted  health  sector  reforms  based  on  the  approved  sector  development  plans.  The\nreadiness  of  the  districts  to  assume  full  responsibility  for  plan  preparation  and  implementation\nvaries, and the duration of the first and second phases will vary accordingly. Districts that have\nparticipated in earlier ADB-funded projects (e.g., districts in Aceh) have already developed basic\ncapacities  in  planning  and  analysis  and  are  likely  to  complete  acceptable  sector  development\nplans  relatively  quickly.  Similarly,  districts  that  have  well-defined  needs  or  priorities  (e.g.,\ndistricts  in  Bengkulu  that  give  priority  to  rehabilitation  of  earthquake-damaged  infrastructure)\nshould  be  able  to  prepare  plans  within  a  few  weeks  or  months.  Other  districts  will  require\nsubstantially longer to develop staff capacities before embarking on plan preparation.\n\n77. \nDuring project processing, districts and provinces were required to review and adapt the\ndraft  project  framework  to  the  local  situation,  identifying  the  needs  for  both  reforms  in  health\nservices organization and possible investments. Each district was allocated an indicative share\nof  the  project  resources  on  the  basis  of  total  population  and  number  of  the  poor.  With  the\ntechnical  support  of  the  provincial  health  planning  bureau,  the  districts  prepared  preliminary\nproposals that were consolidated by the provincial health office. These proposals, reviewed by\nMOHSW and BKKBN, were used for estimating project costs.\n\n78. \nAfter  improving  their  technical  skills  through  first-phase  training  activities,  the  district\nauthorities  will  revise  and  finalize  the  proposals  in  consultation  with  the  community.  MOHSW\nand  BKKBN  will  provide  technical  support  through  in-house  expertise,  consultants,  and\noperational  research.  Each  district  will  prepare  a  sector  development  plan  including  proposals\nfor  (i)  implementing  locally  appropriate  health  sector  reforms,31  and  (ii)  physical  investments.\nThe  district  proposals,  accompanied  by  comments  of  representatives  of  the  local  community\nand  local  experts,  will  be  discussed  among  districts  at  a  meeting  convened  by  the  provincial\nhealth  office  to  identify  complementary  activities,  ensure  coordination  at  the  level  technically\nnecessary to improve effectiveness and efficiency of investment or reforms in the health sector,\nand avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication. The district proposals consolidated by province\nwill be sent to ADB, MOHSW and BKKBN for review.\n\nProposals must be accompanied by a social impact assessment, a description of a local\n79. \nperformance  monitoring  system \nimplementation,  and  a\ncommitment  of  the  concerned  bupati  to  finance  project  activities  and  allocate  necessary\ncounterpart  funds  (Appendix  6).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  based  on  ADB\u2019s\nguidelines  and  including  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  will  also  be\nattached. Proposals meeting the following basic criteria will be approved by ADB:\n\nfor  monitoring  and  evaluating \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nHealth and family planning needs of the local poor and vulnerable groups have\nbeen identified and addressed.\nThe proposal contains a description of locally appropriate mechanisms to ensure\nthe continuation of a health safety net program.\nThe proposal has been developed in a participatory process, and discussed with\nrepresentatives  of  the  local  community,  NGOs,  women\u2019s  organizations  and\nrelevant government agencies.\n\n                                                \n31 Local  health  sector  reforms  will  include  human  resources  management,  public-private  partnership,  health  care\n\nfinancing and resource mobilization, quality assurance, licensing and accreditation, etc.\n\n\f22\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  proposal  is  technically,  economically,  and  environmentally  sound;  and\nappropriate, effective, and cost-efficient.\nThe proposal is in line with the national priorities and the national health policy.\n\nDuring  the  second  phase,  districts  and  provinces  will  review  project  implementation\n80. \nevery  year  and  revise,  if  appropriate,  the  activities  for  the  following  year.  District  progress\nreports  will  be  consolidated  at  the  provincial  level  and  sent  to  MOHSW,  BKKBN,  and  ADB.\nDistrict  progress  reports  will  also  be  made  available  to  members  of  the  DPRD  when  they  will\nneed to approve counterpart funds for project activities.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  taxes  and  contingencies,  is  estimated  at  $87.0\n81. \nmillion  equivalent,  to  cover  $36.7  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  (42  percent),  including\ninterest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  and  $50.3  million  equivalent  in  local  currency\ncosts  (58  percent).  A  summary  of  the  project  cost  is  given  in  Table  2,  detailed  cost  estimates\nare in Appendix 7.\n\nTable 2: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\nA.

Public  debt  increased  to  93  percent  of  GDP,  and  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  situation  is\n\n\f23\n\nexpected  to  remain  unfavorable  over  the  medium  term.  In  view  of  these  difficulties  and  fiscal\nconstraints  in  the  short  to  medium  term,  the  Government  has  requested  that  ADB\u2019s  share  of\nproject financing be increased from 60 percent to 80 percent as an interim measure. Given the\ndifficult situation, it is proposed that ADB finance 80 percent of the project costs during the first\nthree years of project implementation and revert to 60 percent in the fourth year. Relaxation of\nADB\u2019s  cost-sharing  limit  for  project  financing  will  support  Indonesia\u2019s  incipient  economic\nrecovery, and is consistent with the graduation policy32 that provides for cost-sharing higher than\nthe country\u2019s limit under exceptional circumstances and where justified on country and project\nconsiderations. The World Bank currently provides 75 percent of project costs on a three-year\nrolling  average,  and  is  understood  to  be  considering  a  further  increase  in  its  share.  JBIC\ncurrently provides about 85 percent of project costs.\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  in  the  amount  of\n83. \n$65.0 million equivalent (74.7 percent of the total project cost) from its Special Funds resources\nto finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $36.7 million and part of the local currency cost\namounting to $28.3 million equivalent. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1 percent per year during the grace period, and 1.5\npercent per year during the remaining term. The Government will finance the remaining costs of\nthe Project ($21.8 million). The financing plan is summarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n   ($ million)\n\nSource\n\nLocal Currency\n\nTotal Cost\n\nPercent\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\nTotal\n\n28.3\n22.0\n50.3\n\n65.0\n22.0\n87.0\n\n74.7\n25.3\n100.0\n\nForeign\nExchange\n36.7\n-\n36.7\n\n84. \nThe  capacity  building  and  nonrevenue-generating  nature  of  the  Project  and  its  positive\nimpact on the poor and vulnerable groups justify the provision of Special Funds resources. The\nProject will strengthen the capacity of regional governments for sustainable management of health\nservices and give invaluable support to the Government\u2019s efforts for decentralization.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation and Coordination\n\n85. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  MOHSW,  supported  by  BKKBN  for  the\nfamily planning and family welfare activities of the Project. The project organization is given in\nAppendix 8.\n\n86. \nDistrict  Level.  In  each  district,  the  bupati  will  establish  a  district  health  committee\n(DHC).  The  DHC  will  comprise  representatives  of  district  development  planning  agency\n(BAPPEDA),  district  health  services,  BKKBN,  private  health  sector,  community  leaders,\nwomen\u2019s groups, and local NGOs. The bupati or the head of the district BAPPEDA will be the\ndistrict project director (DPD). The head of the district health services will be the district project\nmanager (DPM) assisted by a district implementation unit (DIU). Under the guidance of the DHC\n\n                                                \n32 R204-98: A Graduation Policy for the Bank\u2019s DMCs, 23 November 1998\n\n\f24\n\nand  DPD,  the  DPM  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the  district  action  plan  for  the  following\nyears.  In  addition,  the  DPM  will  supervise  local  project  implementation  (procurement,\ndisbursement,  and  accounting  for  district-level  activities  in  conformity  with  the  proposals\napproved by ADB).\n\n87. \nProvincial  Level.  The  head  of  the  provincial  BAPPEDA  will  be  the  provincial  project\ndirector (PPD). The head of the provincial health services will be the provincial project manager\n(PPM)  assisted  by  a  provincial  project  coordination  and  implementation  unit  (PCIU)  that  will\ncoordinate  project  implementation  in  the  province  and  provide  technical  support  to  districts\nwhen  required.  A  provincial  technical  review  team  (TRT)  will  review  district  and  province\nproposals and annual reports. The head of the planning unit of the provincial health services will\nchair  the  TRT,  which  will  include  (i)  technical  experts  from  provincial  health  services  and\nBKKBN,  the  private  sector,  health  professional  organizations,  local  academic  institutions,  and\nconsultants;  and  (ii)  representatives  of  the  community,  provincial  BAPPEDA  and  NGOs.\nMOHSW and BKKBN staff from the central level will provide guidance and technical support to\nthe TRT.\n\n88. \nCentral  Level.  At  the  central  level,  the  MOHSW  secretary  general  will  be  the  project\ndirector,  with  the  principal  secretary  of  BKKBN  as  deputy  project  director.  The  head  of  the\nMOHSW  planning  bureau  will  be  the  central  project  manager  (CPM)  and  the  head  of  the\ndirectorate  of  planning  of  BKKBN  will  be  deputy  central  project  manager  (DCPM).  A  Central\nTechnical  Committee  (CTC)  will  give  technical  advice  to  CPM  and  DCPM  and  ensure\ncoordination  and  sharing  of  information  between  the  project  districts  and  provinces.  A  central\nsteering  committee  composed  of  senior  representatives  of  the  ministries  and  agencies\nconcerned  (i.e.,  MOHSW,  MOF,  BAPPENAS,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  State  Ministry  of\nRegional  Autonomy,  State  Ministry  for  the  Empowerment  of  Women,  BKKBN)  will  advise  the\nproject director on general policy and intersectoral coordination. A Central Project Coordinating\nUnit  (CPCU),  with  a  subunit  in  BKKBN,  will  coordinate  project  implementation  at  the  central\nlevel and give necessary technical support to the PCIUs and DIUs.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases  over  five  years  commencing  in  early\n89. \n2001 (Appendix 9). The first phase will strengthen awareness and technical capacity in health\nand  family  planning  issues.  At  the  end  of  the  first  phase,  districts  (and  provinces  when\nappropriate)  will  finalize  their  proposals  for  investment  and  local  reforms.  The  proposals\napproved by ADB will be implemented in the second phase.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  The\ntransparency  and\nthe  need \n\n90. \nExecuting  Agency  has  been  advised  of \naccountability in all project activities, as required under ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy.\n\nfor  maintaining \n\nCivil works and equipment procurement packages are for three groups: hospitals, health\n91. \ncenters,  and  others  (covering  health  offices, \nlaboratories,  pharmacy\nstorehouses and housing). Civil works will involve construction and rehabilitation work. As there\nare  no  civil  work  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $1.0  million,  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)\nprocedures will apply, with an exception that civil works for rehabilitating village health facilities\nor  activities  aimed  at  creating  a  healthy  environment  and  preventing  diseases  (such  as\ncommunity latrines and village drains), estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less, may\n\ntraining  centers, \n\n\f25\n\ninvolve the participation of the communities and will be awarded in accordance with procedures\nto  be  agreed  upon  between  the  DIU  and  the  community  concerned,  and  acceptable  to  ADB.\nGoods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  by  international\ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  For  goods  with  a  total  estimated  value  of  $500,000  or\nless,  international  shopping  (IS)  procedures  will  apply,  except  for  vehicles,  motorcycles,  and\noffice  equipment  where  LCB  procedures  will  apply.  Procurement  of  hospital  equipment  will  be\nconsolidated  at  the  provincial  level  or,  when  possible,  at  the  central  level  for  better  efficiency.\nProcurement  of  health  center  equipment  will  be  consolidated  at  the  provincial  level.  Items\ncosting less than $50,000 equivalent can be procured under direct purchase (DP) procedures.\nICB  and  IS  procurement  will  be  handled  by  CPCU,  or  by  PCIU  with  assistance  from  CPCU.\nPCIU will handle LCB with assistance from CPCU. With the assistance of PCIU, DIU will handle\nLCB  for  vehicles,  motorcycles  and  office  equipment.  DIU  will  handle  DP.  The  proposed\nprocurement procedures and indicative packages are summarized in Appendix 10.\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\nBecause of a relatively weak local capacity and lack of experience in decision making,\n92. \nthe Project will provide strong support for project management. Where capacity exists, districts\nand provinces will be encouraged to utilize existing offices and staff for implementation. Where\ncapacity  does  not  exist  or  requires  strengthening,  project  counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to\nfinance  the  services  of  contractual  project  management  staff  at  district,  province,  and  central\nlevels.  In  the  absence  of  significant  contributions  from  current  staff,  five  persons  (278  person-\nmonths) will be engaged at central level, two persons (108 person-months) in each of the seven\nprovinces,  and  one  person  plus  administrative  officers  (60  person-months  plus  lump  sum)  in\neach of the 62 districts and cities. The total is a maximum of 4,394 person-months (4.9 percent\nof project costs).\n\n93. \nInternational and domestic consultants will provide technical support and ensure transfer\nof  knowledge  to  counterpart  staff  in  specific  areas  of  expertise  (Appendix  11).  Part  of  the\nconsulting  services  to  be  provided  will  be  reserved  to  give  project  managers  flexibility  in\nengaging consultants after local needs are identified in the first phase. The Project will fund a\ntotal of about 37 person-months of international and 225 person-months of domestic technical\ninternational\nconsulting  services  (excluding  project  management  staff).  Domestic  and \nconsultants will be engaged individually or through consulting firms.33 Local consulting firms will\nbe engaged for information technology, and environmental and social impact assessments. All\nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements acceptable to ADB for appointing domestic consultants.\n\n5. \n\nTraining Activities\n\n94.  With  project  support,  local  universities  and  teaching  institutions  with  expertise  in  public\nhealth will develop a health system decentralization consortium. Local institutions will be linked\nwith  project  management  staff  by  Internet  connections  whenever  possible  and  will  assist  local\nhealth  services  staff  to  assess  local  training  needs  and  provide  continuous  technical  support\nduring and after implementation. Training activities in the districts and provinces are divided into\ntwo  packages:  a  standard  training  package  (decentralization  and  management)  and  a  training\npackage  based  on  local  needs,  with  a  curriculum  developed  locally  by  the  consortium\nparticipants on request.\n\n                                                \n33 The  decision  to  engage  consultants  individually  or  through  a  consulting  firm  will  depend  on  the  districts\u2019  or\n\nprovinces\u2019 requests, but in any case will require ADB approval.\n\n\f26\n\n95. \nA  group  of  local  trainers  will  first  be  trained  on  the  standard  package.  They  will  be\nselected  from  MOHSW  and  BKKBN  staff,  the  private  sector  and  private  consulting  firms,\nacademic  and  teaching  institutions,  individual  experts,  professional  organizations,  and  NGOs.\nQualified  NGOs  in  particular  will  be  used  for  social  training  in  poverty  reduction,  gender  and\nhealth, and participatory planning and management. Trainees will not be limited to MOHSW and\nBKKBN staff, but will include representatives of NGOs and the private sector. Project managers\nwill ensure gender balance in selecting the trainees, with a view to achieving 50 percent female\nparticipation in each category of training activities.\n\n96. \nFor in-country and overseas academic training and study tours, training institutions and\nvenues  will  be  selected,  and  contracts  awarded  following  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and\ntaking into consideration economy and efficiency. Training beneficiaries will include at least 50\npercent female candidates.\n\n6. \n\nCost Sharing and Funds Flow\n\n97. \nThe Government will disburse the proceeds of the loan and the corresponding counterpart\ncontributions necessary for financing project activities by budgetary transfers of funds earmarked\nfor  such  purpose,  in  accordance  with  Laws  22/99  and  25/99  and  the  prevailing  implementing\nregulations.  The  Government  has  ensured  that  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  for  project\nactivities  will  continue  throughout  the  period  of  project  implementation  by  earmarking  the  funds,\nnotwithstanding  (i)  any  reallocation  of  authority  or  responsibility  for  channeling  of  external\nassistance  and  provision  of  corresponding  counterpart  contributions  between  the  national\nGovernment  and  participating  districts  and  provinces;  or  (ii)  any  requirement  for  providing\nmatching  counterpart  contributions  for  funding  project  activities  from  participating  districts  and\nprovinces, arising from the full implementation of Laws 22/99 and 25/99.\n\n7. \n\nSpecial Account and Statement of Expenditure\n\n98.  MOF will establish an imprest account in Bank Indonesia or a state bank acceptable to\nADB to make payments in local currency for project implementation. Disbursements will follow\nexisting  mechanisms  based  on  the  standard  procedure  for  loan  payment  mechanism.\nDisbursements will be through the MOF Regional Treasury Office (KPKN) and Bank Indonesia\nor state bank branches. The districts and provinces will be responsible for preparing withdrawal\napplications  and  documents  for  project  activities  implemented  at  their  level.  The  applications\nand supporting documents will be consolidated at the provincial level and submitted to the MOF\nBudget Regional Office with copies sent directly to ADB and CPCU. For activities implemented\nby the central level (MOHSW and BKKBN), withdrawal applications and supporting documents\nwill  be  prepared  respectively  by  CPCU  and  BKKBN  CPCU  subunit.  MOF\u2019s  Budget  Regional\nOffice  and  CPCU  will  consolidate  the  withdrawal  applications  and  transmit  the  documents  to\ndirector  general  for  budget.  The  MOF  director  general  for  budget  as  the  authorized\nrepresentative will submit these withdrawal applications to ADB. ADB will replenish the imprest\naccount  upon  receiving  the  withdrawal  applications  consolidated  by  MOF.  MOF  has  ensured\nthat the withdrawal applications will be submitted on a timely basis to ADB for replenishment of\nthe imprest account.\n\n99. \nThe  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  be  the  estimated\nexpenditures  for  the  first  six  months  of  project  implementation,  but  will  not  exceed  $2,000,000\nequivalent. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be used for expenditures not\nexceeding $50,000 per item of expenditure. All special accounts will be established, operated, and\n\n\f27\n\nmaintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated June 1996 and such\ndetailed arrangements as may be agreed upon by the Government and ADB.\n\n8. \n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n100.  All project districts and provinces, MOHSW and BKKBN will maintain separate accounts\nfor all expenditures in accordance with sound accounting principles. All project special accounts,\nincluding financial statements and SOE and special account records, will be audited annually as\npart  of  the  regular  audit  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\naudit  opinion  on  the  special  accounts  and  SOE  procedures  will  be  set  out  separately.  The\nconsolidated  annual  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,  together  with  audit  reports,  in\nEnglish, will be submitted to ADB within nine months after the end of the Government's fiscal year.\nThis will be facilitated by the appointment of a full-time finance officer in CPCU. The CPCU will\nsubmit  to  ADB,  within  30  days  after  the  end  of  each  calendar  quarter,  consolidated  progress\nreports  on  the  Project  in  a  form  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  Government,\ndistricts, and provinces have been informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts. A\nformal warning will be issued if accounts are more than six months overdue, and disbursements\nwill suspended if the accounts are 12 months overdue.\n\n9. \n\nProject Supervision and Reports\n\n101.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  project  review  every  six  months  after  loan\neffectiveness and a midterm review upon completion of the second year of implementation, before\nSeptember  2003,  to  assess  progress  and  achievements  against  the  objectives,  identify  any\nproblems  encountered,  and  recommend  remedial  measures  if  required.  The  findings  of  the\nmidterm  review  will  be  discussed  at  provincial  and  central  workshops  to  be  attended  by  the\nprovincial  and  district  health  and  family  planning  officers  concerned,  representatives  of  the\nagencies involved in the Project, and ADB.\n\n102.  The Government will coordinate and cooperate with ADB in reviewing the Project and in\nthis  connection,  will  submit  to  ADB  documents  and  reports  that  may  be  required.  Within  three\nmonths  after  the  loan  closing  date,  the  provinces  and  the  Government  will  submit  a  project\ncompletion report to ADB, in such form and detail as ADB may request.\n\n10. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n103.  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  CPCU  will  develop  a  performance  monitoring\nsystem  (PM)  for  training  and  capacity-building  activities,  and  each  province  will  develop  a  PM\nbased  on  the  project  framework  for  local  activities.  Technical  support  will  be  necessary  to\nstrengthen local capacity and ensure that appropriate and valid baseline data are collected. This\ntechnical support will be provided from the pool of consulting services or by NGOs and through\noperational research, as necessary. As soon as possible, indicators, targets, and mechanisms\nfor collecting data will be publicized on the Internet. PM information will be regularly updated (at\nleast every quarter) under the responsibility of the PPM, and freely available on the Internet for\nreview and discussion by the public. The PCU will ensure that local NGOs are informed about\nthe PM and have access to the information. Benchmark data to be collected during the first year\nof project implementation will be necessary to support any follow-up proposal for investment or\nreforms during the second phase.\n\n104.  The  community  will  actively  participate  in  project  monitoring  through  the  DHCs.  During\nthe second phase, the DHC will meet at least once a year to review project implementation and\n\n\f28\n\npropose any modification, if necessary, in the plan of action for the following year. Reports from\nthe DHC will be submitted to the PPM and sent to ADB, MOHSW and BKKBN.\n\nF. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n105.  The Executing Agency will be MOHSW. BKKBN will support MOHSW for family planning\nand  family  welfare  activities  of  the  Project.  MOHSW  and  BKKBN  have  been  executing  or\nimplementing agencies for all ADB projects in the health sectors and have experience with ADB\nprocedures  and  regulations.  However,  decentralization  will  impose  new  relations  between  the\ncentral level and the districts and provinces. The precise functions of MOHSW and BKKBN in a\ndecentralized  health  system  have  not  yet  been  clearly  defined.  The  two  agencies  will  need  to\ndefine  their  new  functions.  Their  role  will  shift  from  implementing  agencies  to  policy-making\nagencies responsible for developing national health and family planning policy and guidelines,\nand developing and monitoring quality standards for health services.\n\n106.  The  project  implementation  arrangements  will  ensure  that  MOHSW  and  BKKBN  can\nshare their experience in managing ADB-supported health projects with the project districts and\nprovinces.  They  will  play  the  role  of  coordinators  and  technical  advisers.  But  the  districts  will\nhave  the  main  role  in,  and  responsibility  for,  implementation.  For  many  districts,  their  lack  of\nexperience  with  ADB  procedures  and  regulation  will  demand  strong  and  regular  support.  This\nsupport  will  be  provided  by  domestic  consultants,  MOHSW  and  BKKBN,  and  frequent  review\nmissions  from  ADB.  The  Internet  connections  developed  under  the  Project  will  also  facilitate\ncommunication with the district and province units.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n107.  The  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  hospitals  and  health  centers  will  require  IEE,\nincluding  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans.  Other  civil  works  (e.g.,\nrehabilitation  of  existing  facilities)  will  be  undertaken  with  minimal  disturbance  to  the\nenvironment.  The  district  head  will  ensure  that  appropriate  environmental  regulations  are\nfollowed  and  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans  recommended  by  the  IEE\nare implemented. Optimal use of local materials will be promoted. Handling of refuse and disposal\nof hazardous medical waste will be specifically considered and addressed in each case.\n\n108.  To  be  considered  by  ADB,  the  proposals  finalized  by  the  districts  and  provinces  must\nalso be accompanied by social impact assessment. The proposal must clearly indicate how the\nhealth and family planning needs of the poor and vulnerable groups were identified, what these\nneeds are, and how the proposal addresses these needs.\n\n109.  Districts  and  provinces  have  been  specifically  requested  to  prepare  an  alternative\nproposal  to  continue  or  replace  JPS-BK,  the  health  safety  net  program  developed  during  the\ncrisis.  Developing  and  implementing  a  sustainable  JPS-BK  exit  strategy  are  a  Government\npriority. ADB experience in JPS-BK through SPSDP and HNSDP will prove useful in supporting\nthe  development  of  long-term  sustainable  and  locally  adapted  programs  by  the  districts  and\nprovinces  to  ensure  access  to  essential  health  services  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.\nBetter  identification  of  the  beneficiaries,  using  the  JPS-BK  experience,  will  permit  better\ntargeting of the public resources and reduce the number of eligible poor who do not benefit from\nthe  programs  and  of  better-off  beneficiaries  who  should  not  have  priority  for  the  public\nresources. The essential features of SPSDP and HNSDP will be emphasized: protection of the\npoor and prevention of malnutrition among infants, children under five years, pregnant women,\nand  lactating  mothers.  SPSDP  and  HNSDP  incentives  for  village  midwives  to  actively  provide\n\n\f29\n\ntheir services in the community will be promoted. Participation of the community and civil society\nin monitoring the use of funds will be advocated.\n\n110.  The participation of BKKBN in the Project reflects the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s concern\nwith  reproductive  health  and  the  need  to  maintain  access  to  family  planning  for  everybody.\nFamilies  have  become  accustomed  to  the  opportunities  offered  by  planning  their  family  and\nspacing  births.  With  family  planning,  women  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  the  job  opportunities\noffered  by  a  recovering  economy  and  fully  participate  in  the  economic  development  of  their\ncommunity.\n\nH. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n111.  The Project will be accompanied by technical assistance to support policy reforms in the\nhealth sector. The MOHSW will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA (Appendix 12) will\npermit the Government and the project provinces to further assess the need for national and/or\nregional  health  sector  reforms  in  the  new  context  of  decentralization,  and  to  develop  and\nimplement these reforms. The TA is proposed to be financed by ADB on a grant basis from JSF,\nfunded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  application  for  financing  for  the  JSF  is  under\nconsideration by the Government of Japan.\n\n112.  The  TA  will  provide  36  person-months  consulting  services.  An  individual  health  policy\nreform  adviser,  based  in  Jakarta,  will  support  the  MOHSW  policy  advisory  group  (para.  44)  in\ncoordinating and implementing policy reforms related to decentralization. The adviser will assist\nMOHSW,  BKKBN,  and  the  districts  and  provinces  in  implementing  decentralization  and\nidentifying  opportunities  for  and  constraints  to  reform,  and  in  monitoring  implementation  of\nhealth  sector  reform  proposals.  The  consultant  will  ensure  continuity  in  advisory  services  and\nfacilitate  exchange  of  experience  and  lessons  learned  between  the  project  districts  and\nprovinces; and coordination and linkage with activities of other aid agencies. The consultant will\nbe selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\n113.  The second component of the TA will consist of resources to be allocated by MOHSW\nupon  agreement  to  support  operations  research,  studies,  workshops,  and  activities  related  to\nhealth sector reforms. All TA financed activities will need to be approved by ADB. The research\nand  study  proposals  will  have  to  be  prepared  within  two  years  of  TA  approval  and  completed\nwithin 30 months of TA approval.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\nInvestment in public health through the Project will yield considerable economic benefits.\n114. \nLocal governments have the potential to grasp and reflect local needs, and to devise the most\nefficient delivery mechanisms to expand the outreach of public health services and minimize the\ncosts of delivery. The Project will draw out the potential economic benefits of decentralization by\nhelping the provinces and districts to maximize this potential through institutional and capacity\nbuilding, investment, and reforms.\n\n115.  The  Project  will  lead  to  substantial  cost  savings  through  health  sector  reforms  and\ncapacity-building  activities.  Merging  the  parallel  local  health  offices  reporting,  respectively,  to\ncentral MOHSW and to the local government will achieve substantial cost savings and improve\nefficiency  through  effective  system  development,  optimal  allocation  of  workforces,  and  human\n\n\f30\n\nresources development. Public-private partnerships planned as part of the reforms will improve\npublic  sector  efficiency  through  its  direct  exposure  to  market  competition  with  private  health\nservice  providers.  A  more  comprehensive  and  quantitative  economic  analysis  is  attached  in\nSupplementary Appendix A.\n\n116.  Economic analysis was conducted using disability-adjusted life year (DALY)34 and gross\nregional domestic product data in each of the seven project provinces. The expected reduction\nof  the  DALY  gap  between  project  provinces  and  developed  countries,35  and  cost  savings\nexpected  to  result  from  the  necessary  rationalization  of  the  workforces  were  considered  the\nmain economic benefits of the Project. To calculate the value of the project benefits, the number\nof DALY gained was multiplied by the per capita gross provincial domestic product, and median\nage  salaries  of  civil  servants  was  used  for  staff  rationalization.  In  each  province,  the  value  of\nprojects benefits over 10 years were compared with the costs of project activities,36 discounted\nat the rate of 12 percent. The benefit-cost ratio varies from 11.8 in Riau to 1.1 in Bengkulu, with\nan  average  of  4.5.  Low  figures  for  Bengkulu  reflect  incremental  costs  related  to  emergency\nrehabilitation of earthquake-damaged physical infrastructure (Table 4).\n\nTable 4: Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nItem\n\nAceh\n\nBali\n\nBengkulu\n\nRiau\n\nCentral\nSulawesi\n\nNorth\nSulawesi\n\nSoutheast\nSulawesi\n\nA.

World Development Report: Investing in Health. Washington, DC.\n36 Activities covered by the central Government are not counted in this analysis.\n\n\fB. \n\nProject Sustainability\n\n31\n\n118.  Two factors are important to ensure sustainability of health service delivery: greater cost-\nefficiency  in  resource  allocation  and  increased  resources  mobilization.  A  major  benefit  of\ndecentralization  is  the  local  participation  in  identifying  the  needs  and  developing  appropriate\nsolutions,  taking  into  consideration  local  conditions.  With  adequate  technical  skills,  significant\nefficiency  gains  in  health  services  planning  and  management  can  be  realized.  Rationalizing\npersonnel and increasing public-private partnership are among the main issues that districts and\nprovinces must address, in preparing their reform proposals.\n\n119.  Project  investments  in  advocacy  and  capacity  building  will  be  essential  to  ensure\nsustainability.  These  activities  target  not  only  health  staff  but  also  nonhealth  stakeholders\nincluding  members  of  the  local  governments.  People  responsible  for  identifying  priorities  and\nallocating  resources  in  the  districts  and  provinces  will  benefit  from  the  training  activities,\ntechnical  support  from  experts,  and  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  ADB.  This  will  increase\nallocation efficiency.\n\n120.  Primary  health  care37  is  a  very  cost-effective  strategy  for  health  service  delivery.  The\nProject  aims  to  guarantee  quality  primary  health  care  services  for  the  poor.  Because  primary\nhealth  care  services  have  large  positive  externalities  and  are  most  beneficial  to  the  poor,  it  is\ninappropriate to insist on cost-recovery for such services.38 Cost recovery inhibits not only poor\npeople\u2019s  access  to  essential  health  services;  it  also  imposes  large  administrative  costs.\nHowever,  the  Project  emphasizes  resource  mobilization  for  health  services,  and  will  finance\ntraining activities, technical expertise and, when appropriate, implementation of reforms that will\nhelp mobilize new resources in the districts and provinces. In particular, the development of a\nhealth  insurance  system  or  a  managed  care  system  is  a  priority  of  the  Government  and  the\nnational  health  policy.  Better  public-private  partnership  also  will  get  the  private  sector  more\ninvolved in health care financing. Advocacy and policy dialogue, increased efficiency in resource\nallocation,  and  mobilization  of  new  resources  for  the  health  sector  are  the  main  mechanisms\nthat will ensure sustainability of project investments.\n\nC. \n\nEnvironment\n\n121.  The Project will finance rehabilitation of hospitals and health centers and construction of\nnew facilities justified through health development plans. The proposal submitted by the district\nand  provincial  governments  on  financing  these  activities  must  include  IEE,  and  environmental\nmanagement  and  monitoring  plans.  The  IEE  will  focus  not  only  on  the  impacts  during\nconstruction  of  the  health  facilities  but  also  on  those  during  the  operation  (e.g.,  handling  of\nmedical  wastes).  The  IEE  report  and  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans\napproved  by  the  Government  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  before  any  civil  works  are  approved.\nSome districts have proposed to address, under the Project, sanitation and environment issues\nthat  have  a  positive  impact  on  health.  With  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  the  Project,\npositive environmental impacts will occur through improved sanitation.\n\n                                                \n37 Primary health care includes essential promotive (health education and promotion of healthy lifestyle), preventive\n\n(immunization and nutrition programs), and curative (basic curative services) health services.\n\n38 ADB. Policy for the Health Sector , February 1999.\n\n\fD. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n32\n\n122.  The rationale and the design of the Project explain its high social value indicated by the\ninitial  poverty  impact  assessment  (Appendix  13).  The  Government  is  the  main  provider  of\nmodern  health  services  for  the  poor,  women,  and  children;  any  disruption  of  the  public  health\ncare delivery system will mainly affect these groups. While the better-off will probably be able to\nafford  the  services  of  private  providers,  the  poor  will  face  major  problems.  Focus  group\ndiscussions  with  women  revealed  their  particular  concern  with  the  cessation  of  the  JPS-BK\nactivities as the program closes at the end of 2001, and possible disruption in the availability of\nhealth  care  services  and  contraceptives.  The  immediate  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  ensure\ntechnical support to the districts to maintain normal health services delivery. This support will be\nmost  necessary  during  the  difficult  initial  phase  of  decentralization,  which  explains  the\nGovernment\u2019s request for fast processing of the Project.\n\n123.  Districts  will  pay  particular  attention  to  accessibility  of  health  services  for  the  poor  and\nwill review the JPS-BK program to ensure continuation of those elements that have shown the\ngreatest impact on the poor. Paradoxically during the crisis, access to essential services for the\npoor was protected with the establishment of JPS-BK. But this program was financed mainly by\nexternal  resources.  Appropriate  mechanisms  must  be  found  to  maintain  the  benefits  of  the\nprogram  while  ensuring  its  continuity  and  sustainability.  Reorientation  of  JPS-BK  is  a  project\npriority.\n\n124.  Family  planning  and  reproductive  health,  of  greatest  concern  to  women,  are  primary\nproject  components.  With  quality  family  planning  accessible  to  everybody  and  especially  the\npoor,  families  are  able  to  space  births  and  ensure  a  harmonious  development  of  all  the\nmembers. Women\u2019s option to control their fertility gives them greater control over their destiny.\nWomen also will benefit from all training activities. Priority will be given to women trainees with a\nview to achieve 50 percent of women trainees and fellowship candidates. This recommendation\nwill benefit women in the local community and provide them with greater opportunities for career\nadvancement.\n\n125.  The project districts, particularly in Riau, Central Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi, have\nsignificant  numbers  of  indigenous  groups  almost  entirely  dependent  on  the  public  health  care\nsystem.  Their  continued  access  to  health  care  depends  on  the  degree  to  which  local  health\nservices and decision makers give priority to the needs of the poor and vulnerable communities\nunder decentralization.\n\n126.  With an advocacy campaign targeting local authorities and capacity-building activities for\nhealth staff, the populations in the project area will have some guarantee that the decentralized\npublic health services will continue to function normally. Capacity building and investment in the\nhealth sector will have an immediate impact on the quality of the health services and, hopefully,\non  patient  satisfaction.  Better  quality  health  services  will  result  in  better  health  and  nutrition\nstatus for the local population.\n\nE. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n127.  Although decentralization is required by law, its rapid implementation carries major risks\nof disruption of public services for these reasons: regulations are not ready or well understood,\ninstructions  can  be  misinterpreted,  and  there  was  no  time  to  build  up  local  capacity.  Project\nactivities will be planned and implemented by local staff with little or no experience, who are not\nused  to  taking  initiative  or  accepting  responsibility.  The  Project  was  designed  to  reduce  these\n\n\f33\n\nrisks.  The  Project  is  process-oriented  and  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases,  emphasizing\ncapacity building in the first phase.  Investment and reform proposals will be confirmed only at\nthe  end  of  the  first  phase.  Although  preliminary  investment  proposals  have  been  prepared  by\nthe  districts,  these  proposals  must  be  reviewed  and  refined  and  submitted  with  appropriate\njustification  for  formal  endorsement  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  This  two-step  approach  will\nensure identification and selection of cost-efficient investments. The continuous participation of\nthe  local  community  in  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring,  through  the  DHC,  will\nincrease a local sense of ownership, facilitate sustainability of activities, and guarantee that the\nProject effectively benefits the targeted beneficiaries.\n\n128.  Counterpart funding for project activities has been carefully discussed, but remains a risk\ndue to the prevailing economic difficulties and because Law 25/99 limits the rights of the central\nGovernment to earmark funds that will be used in the districts and the provinces. In accordance\nwith  Laws  22/99  and  25/99,  project  funds  will  be  channeled  through  SAF  /  GAF.  Project\nresources  have  been  allocated  to  ensure  that  delay  in  counterpart  funding  will  not  prevent\nimplementation  of  essential  project  activities. \nthe  spirit  of  decentralization,  project\nimplementation relies mainly on the commitment of the districts. During project preparation, all\nbupatis of the project districts signed a written commitment to support activities, and all health\ndevelopment proposals submitted to ADB for project funding must attach a commitment of the\nbupati to allocate necessary counterpart funds. The Government has assured that counterpart\nfunds for the Project will be guaranteed and channeled through SAF, the only legal mechanism\nto transfer earmarked funds to the districts.\n\nIn \n\n129.  Good  governance  is  essential.  With  weak  administrative  capacity,  limited  experience,\nand  still  fluid  control  and  reporting  systems,  a  major  risk  is  misallocation  and  waste  of\nresources. Transparency and accountability may be easier to implement at the local level with\nparticipation of the local community, but will also require better monitoring, down to the project\nareas.  Project  coverage  of  62  districts  and  cities  creates  logistical  issues  for  supervision  and\nmonitoring  that  can  be  reduced  by  using  information  technology  and  Internet  communication\nextensively.\n\n130.  Weak technical and managerial capacity and lack of experience may be an obstacle that\nwill  reduce  absorptive  capacity  in  the  districts  and  provinces,  and  delay  disbursement  of  the\nloan proceeds. By design, the ADB loan amount will not be sufficient to cover all the needs of\nthe  project  provinces,39  but  it  will  guarantee  that  the  districts  and  provinces  systematically\nprioritize their activities and investments, and do not waste relatively costly resources.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\n131.  The  Government  have  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n                                                \n39 The  total  cost  of  the  preliminary  proposals  prepared  by  the  districts  and  the  provinces  amounts  to  about  $101.0\nmillion equivalent. As the total project costs (including ADB loan and counterpart funds) amount to $87.0 million,\nthere is a gap between the needs already identified and the resources available. Therefore, choices will have to be\nmade and districts and provinces will have to prioritize their investments.\n\n\f(i) \n\nSocial dimensions. The Government will ensure that the Project will be implemented in line\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations.\n\n34\n\n(iv) \n\nLaws 22/99 and 25/99. The Government will\n\nThe  proposals  to  be  prepared  by  the  districts  will  provide  qualitative  and\nquantitative  data  on  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  groups  living  in  the  concerned\nadministrative  area  (including  internally  displaced  persons  and  indigenous\npeople). Criteria defining \u201cpoor and vulnerable groups\u201d will be specified.\n\nIn selecting the participants for all training activities, priority will be given to women\nso  as  to  achieve  50  percent  female  participation  in  each  category  of  training\nactivities.\n\nThe  management  information  system  (MIS)  and  performance  monitoring  system\nfor the Project will provide gender disaggregated data and information.\n\nCounterpart  Funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  counterpart  funds  for  project\nimplementation are provided in a timely manner. Hence , the Government will make timely\nsubmissions  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  requests  and  adopt  all  other  measures\nnecessary  or  appropriate  for  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds  to  the\nparticipating provinces and districts during each year of implementation.\n\nEarmarked  funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  the  period  of  project\nimplementation,  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  and  the  corresponding  amount  of  necessary\ncounterpart  funds,  shall  be  disbursed  to  project  provinces  and  project  districts,  by\nbudgetary transfers of funds earmarked for such purpose.\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(a) \n\nensure that funds from the loan proceeds and the counterpart funds will continue\nthroughout  project  implementation  by  earmarking  the  funds,  notwithstanding  any\nreallocation of authority or responsibility for channeling of external assistance and\nprovision  of  corresponding  counterpart  contributions  between \nthe  national\nGovernment and the participating provinces and districts, or any requirements for\nmatching  counterpart  funds  for  project  activities  from  participating  provinces  and\ndistricts  arising  from  the  full  implementation  of  Laws  22/99  and  25/99,  unless\notherwise agreed to by ADB.\n\n(b) \n\nregularly  update  ADB  on  decentralization  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the\nprovisions  of  Laws  22/99  and  25/99  of  1999,  and  any  implementing  regulations\nissued thereunder, and take into account any views expressed by ADB thereon.\n\nProject management and counterpart staff. In all participating districts and cities, a district\nhealth  committee  (DHC),  comprising  representatives  of  the  district  health  services,\nBAPPEDA,  BKKBN,  private  sector,  community  leaders,  women\u2019s  organizations  and\nNGOs,  will  be  established  at  least  six  months  before  the  district  concerned  submits  its\nproposals for ADB approval.\n\nEnvironment. IEE and environmental management and monitoring plans will be required\nfor  rehabilitating  and  constructing  hospitals  or  health  centers  funded  by  the  Project.  The\nIEE  reports  and  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans  endorsed  by  the\nGovernment  must  be  approved  by  ADB  before  any  civil  works  are  approved.  The\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n\f35\n\nGovernment and Executing Agency will ensure that the environmental management and\nmonitoring plan of each hospital will be implemented.\n\n(vii) \n\nPerformance monitoring system.\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe Government will ensure that within six months of loan effectiveness, a PM is\ndeveloped at the central level for training and capacity-building activities, and a PM\nfor all other project activities in each province.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  within  three  months  of  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the\nlocal  investment  proposals,  the  PM  attached  to  the  approved  proposal  will  be\nimplemented at the local level.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n132.  The effectiveness of the Loan Agreement will be subject to the issuance of a decree by\nMOHSW,  or  another  relevant  authority  within  MOHSW,  establishing  a  central  project\ncoordination  unit  in  MOHSW,  to  be  headed  by  the  Chief  of  the  Bureau  of  Planning  as  Project\nManager.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n133. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  Loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  50,531,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Decentralized  Health\nServices  Project,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\nTADAO CHINO\n    President\n\n23 November 2000\n\n\f36\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1, 3\n\n2, 4\n\n12, 40\n\n16, 54\n\n19, 67\n\n21, 79\n\n22, 81\n\n23, 85\n\n24, 89\n\n24, 91\n\n25, 93\n\n29, 111\n\n32, 122\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nProject Framework\n\nDemographic and Health Data of Project Area\n\nAsian Development Bank Assistance to Indonesia to\nthe Health, Population, and Nutrition Sectors\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nTraining and Fellowships\n\nMechanisms for Approval of Proposals\n\nProject Cost Estimates\n\nProject Organization and Management\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nProcurement Packages\n\nProject Management Personnel and Consulting\nServices\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nSocial and Poverty Impact Assessment\n\n(cid:1)(cid:2)\n\n(cid:3)(cid:4)\n\n(cid:3)(cid:5)\n\n(cid:3)(cid:2)\n\n(cid:6)(cid:7)\n\n(cid:6)(cid:3)\n\n(cid:6)(cid:5)\n\n(cid:6)(cid:8)\n\n(cid:6)(cid:9)\n\n(cid:5)(cid:4)\n\n(cid:5)(cid:1)\n\n(cid:5)(cid:3)\n\n67\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis\n\nHealth Care Financing in Indonesia\n\nDraft Indigenous People Plan\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nNarrative Summary\n\nPerformance Targets\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\n\nA.

The national TB\nprogram reports treatment results only known for less than 15 percent of cases and only\n50  percent  of  health  centers  have  directly  observed  treatment/short  course  (DOTS)\nprograms.\nIndicators  to  monitor  TB  should  include  conversion  rates  >80  percent,  cure  rates  >85\npercent, and reduced lab errors, but data quality must first be improved.\nNo data are available from private sector practitioners, a key issue for the public-private\npartnership component.\nThere  is  generally  an  increase  in  case  detection,4  which  will  require  coordination\nbetween  the  province  and  districts.  Laboratory  quality  assurance  to  reduce  false\nnegatives/positives will need to be part of the quality of health services component.\nDOTS programs have expanded rapidly with insufficient attention to training and quality\nassurance, requiring this to be one aspect of the quality assurance component.\n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Many hospital staff have not been trained adequately in TB drug management, with high\ndropout rates leading to multidrug resistance, an issue for the training components of the\nproject\nTB drug supply nationally is very problematic. This will be an issue under decentralization\nin  terms  of  role  definition  and  capacity-building  for  procurement,  drugs  supplies\nmanagement and logistics.\nReporting,  surveillance,  and  supervision  are  key  problem  areas  requiring  capacity\nbuilding activities.\n\n(x) \n\n4. \n\nNoncommunicable Disease\n\nThe  demographic  transition  places  a  double  burden  on  the  health  system,  with  rising\n12.\nrates  of  noncommunicable  diseases  (e.g.,  at  health  centers  level  over  40  percent  outpatient\ncases are for hypertension, asthma, etc.). Smoking is a major contributor to these diseases but\nthere is little political will to develop strategies to counter the trend (e.g., enforced no-smoking\nareas,  no  selling  of  cigarettes  to  minors,  a  portion  of  tobacco  taxes  directed  to  the  health\nsector).\n\n5. \n\nNutrition\n\nThe  issue  of  malnutrition  needs  to  be  further  discussed.

Iodine  deficiency  disease  (IDD)  has  declined  overall\nbecause 80 percent of households use iodized salt. Vitamin A deficiency had been reduced until\nthe crisis disrupted the distribution program. This will need to be reestablished as part of a local\nhealth safety net program (based on service statistics, Vitamin A distribution coverage in 1998\nin descending order is Southeast Sulawesi 83 percent, Bali 69 percent, Riau 52 percent, Central\nSulawesi 47 percent, North Sulawesi 45 percent, Aceh 40 percent, Bengkulu 36.3 percent).\n\n                                                \n4  Draft Plan of Action National TB Program of Indonesia 2000.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 3\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\nASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA TO THE\nHEALTH, POPULATION, AND NUTRITION SECTORS\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\n      Date of\n      Approval\n\nAmount\n($ million)\n\nA. \n\nLoans\n\nHealth and Population\nSecond Health and Population\nRural Health and Population\nFamily Health and Nutrition\nIntensified Communicable Diseases Control\nSocial Protection Sector Development Program\nSocial Protection Sector Development Project\nHealth and Nutrition Sector Development Program\nHealth and Nutrition Sector Development Project\n\nTotal\n\nB. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nProduction and Distribution of Essential Drugs\nHealth and Population Sector Study\nHealth and Population\nSecond Health and Population\nPreparation of Community Health Services\nResource Mobilization and Budgeting for Decentralized\n\nHealth Services\n\nCommunicable Diseases Control\nFamily Health and Nutrition\nEnhancing the Quality of Reproductive Health Care\nCapacity Building of Ministry of Health for Strategic\n\nDevelopment\n\nReproductive Health Care\nEarly Childhood Development\nMonitoring and Evaluating the Health and Nutrition\n\n743\n926\n1299\n1471\n1523\n1622\n1623\n1675\n1676\n\n358\n485\n552\n932\n1634\n2221\n\n2300\n2301\n2312\n2814\n\n2839\n2930\n3175\n\n7 Oct 1985\n29 Nov 1988\n26 May 1994\n27 Sep 1996\n19 Jun 1997\n9 Jul 1998\n9 Jul 1998\n25 Mar 1999\n25 Mar 1999\n\n1 Jul 1980\n4 Oct 1982\n17 Nov 1983\n7 Dec 1987\n31 Dec 1991\n5 Dec 1994\n\n17 Feb 1995\n17 Feb 1995\n14 Mar 1995\n19 Jun 1997\n\n11 Aug 1997\n9 Dec 1997\n25 Jan 2000\n\n41.6\n39.3\n40.0\n45.0\n87.4\n100.0\n200.0\n100.0\n200.0\n\n853.3\n\n170.0\n50.0\n250.0\n335.0\n480.0\n600.0\n\n800.0\n600.0\n840.0\n800.0\n\n500.0\n900.0\n1,000.0\n\n3175\n\nMonitoring and Evaluating the Health and Nutrition\n\n25 Mar 2000\n\n1,000.0\n\n3176\n\nCapacity Building to Support Decentralized Health\n\n25 Mar 1999\n\n1,000.0\n\nSector\n\nServices\n\nSector (Supplementary)\n\n3448\n\nDecentralized Health Services\n\n26 May 2000\n\n150.0\n\nTotal\n\n9,475.0\n\n\fPOLICY DIALOGUE\n\nThe Project continues policy dialogue for health sector reforms started in previous ADB health projects.

Loan  1471-INO:\nFamily Health and Nutrition Project (FHN) emphasizes active participation of families and communities in improving their health and\nnutrition  status,  and  tries  to  develop  client-oriented  attitudes  among  health  services  providers.  Loan  1523-INO:  Intensified\nCommunicable  Disease  Control  Project  (ICDC)  aims  at  improving  communicable  diseases  control  at  the  regional  level,  developing\nlocal capacity and regional coordination. Loans 1622/1623-INO: Social Protection Sector Development Program (SPSDP) and Loans\n1675/1676-INO: Health and Nutrition Sector Development Program (HNSDP) supported a series of policy reforms to ensure better\naccess  to  and  availability  of  health  services  to  the  poor,  to  strengthen  decentralization,  and  to  improve  service  effectiveness  and\nefficiency.

The  DPM  is  also  responsible  for\nensuring  that  a  social  impact  assessment  and  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)\nreports are attached to the proposals. The DPM submits the proposal to the DPD. Once the\nDPD endorses the proposal, he or she must commit to finance the proposed activities and\nallocate the necessary counterpart funds. This commitment from DPD must accompany the\nproposal.  When  the  district  proposal  is  ready,  with  all  the  required  attachments,  the  DPD\nsends it to the Provincial Project Director (PPD) for consolidation with all proposals from the\nprovince. The DPM also sends a copy of the district proposal approved by the DPD to the\nProvincial Project Manager.\n\n\u2022  The Provincial Project Manager (PPM) will initiate the development/review of the provincial\nproposal (if any). The PPM will collect the district proposals and submit them for comments\nto  the  Provincial  Technical  Review  Team  (PTRT).

The  PPM  will  submit  the  consolidated  proposals\nfrom the districts and the province (if any), together with the comments from the PTRT, to\nthe Provincial Project Director (PPD). The PPD will send the consolidated proposals directly\nto  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  approval,  and  will  send  a  copy  to  the  Project\nDirector (central). The PPM will ensure that a copy of the consolidated proposals approved\nby the PPD is sent to the Project Manager (central). The review of the district proposals at\nthe provincial level must be completed within one month of receiving the proposal from the\nDPD. If the PPD does not send the consolidated district proposals to ADB within one month\nof  receiving  the  districts  proposals,  the  DPD  is  allowed  to  send  the  proposal  directly  from\nhis/her district to ADB, with a copy to the Project Director (central).\n\n\u2022  At the central level, the Project Manager (central) will initiate the development of the central\nproposal, and collect the consolidated proposals received from the provinces. All proposals\nwill be submitted for comments to the Central Technical Committee (CTC). When comments\nare  received  from  the  CTC,  the  Project  Manager  will  submit  the  central  proposal  and  the\ncomments on the consolidated provincial and district proposals to the Project Director. The\nProject Director will send the central proposal and comments on the consolidated provincial\nand  district  proposals  to  ADB.  Comments  on  the  consolidated  provincial  and  district\nproposal  approved  by  the  Project  Director  must  be  sent  to  ADB  within  one  month  of\nreceiving the consolidated proposals from the PPD.\n\n\u2022  Before approval of the district and provincial proposals, ADB will wait for comments from the\nProject  Director  (central).

For  several  years,  there  has  been  continuing  dialogue  between  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Government on the need for health sector policy reform and\nassessment  of  reform  options.1  The  dialogue  intensified  when  the  economic  crisis  affected\nIndonesia in 1997-1998. The Ministry of Health (now the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare\n[MOHSW])  rapidly  set  up  a  social  safety  net  program  (JPS-BK)  to  protect  access  to  and\navailability of essential health services with ADB support.2 MOHSW and ADB developed policy\nmatrices  that  identified  urgently  needed  reforms.  The  full  implementation  of  decentralization\nstarting in 2001 demands that reforms be implemented, but also offers new opportunities.\n\n2.\nHealth sector reforms are necessary to help the Indonesian health system adapt to the\nnew social, political, and economic environment. Many aspects of the health system need to be\nreviewed to assess whether they are still appropriate in the present context or whether changes\nshould  be  introduced  to  improve  effectiveness  and  efficiency.  These  aspects  include  health\nsystem  organization,  role  of  MOHSW,  quality  assurance,  health  care  financing,  public-private\npartnerships,  family  planning  program  and  reproductive  health,  staff  management  and,  most\nimportant,  how  the  health  system  can  ensure  that  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  groups  have\naccess to quality health services when needed.\n\nThe objective of the TA is to assist MOHSW in identifying, implementing, and evaluating\n3.\nappropriate  health  sector  reforms  in  the  context  of  decentralization.  Decentralization  offers\ndistricts  and  provinces  opportunities  to  adapt  the  health  system  to  local  needs  and  the\nconditions,  according  to  national  policies  and  with  technical  guidance  from  MOHSW.  TA\nresources will be used to support reforms not only at the central level, but also in the districts\nand the provinces. The TA will not be limited to the project area but will cover all districts and\nprovinces, according to the needs and MOHSW request.\n\nThe  TA  will  have  two  components:  (i)  consulting  services,  and  (ii)  operation  research\n4.\nand  analysis.  TA  funds  will  be  used  to  engage  a  long-term  consultant  for  36  person-months.\nThe consultant will ensure continuity in advisory services. The role of the consultant will be to\nassist  MOHSW  and  local  health  services  in  identifying  opportunities  for  health  sector  reforms;\ndeveloping  reform  programs  and  implementation  plans;  assessing  the  potential  impact  of  the\nreforms  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups;  monitoring  implementation  of  the  reforms;  and\nevaluating  the  overall  impact  of  the  reforms  on  health  services  quality,  efficiency  and\nsustainability. The consultant will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\n\n5.\nThe  second  component  will  consist  of  resources  to  be  allocated  by  MOHSW  in\nconsultation with ADB, for operations research studies in support of health sector reforms. The\n\n                                                \n1  TA 2221-INO: Resource Mobilization and Budgeting for Decentralized Health Services, for $600,000, approved on\n5 December 1994 and completed in September 1996, and TA 2814-INO: Capacity Building of Ministry of Health for\nStrategic Development, for $800,000, approved on 19 June 1997 and completed in March 1999.\n\n2  Loan  1622/1623-INO: Social Protection Sector Development Program  (SPSDP),  for  $300  million,  approved  on  9\nJuly 1998 (with 50.8 percent for the health sector); Loan 1675/1676-INO: Health and Nutrition Sector Development\nProgram (HNSDP), for $300 million, approved on 25 March 1999.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nresearch  and  study  proposals  will  have  to  be  prepared  and  then  approved  by  ADB  within  two\nyears of TA approval.\n\nB. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n6.\nThe TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000 equivalent, of which $790,000 will be the foreign\nexchange cost and $460,000 equivalent the local currency cost. ADB will provide a grant of $1.0\nmillion  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  to  cover  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $210,000\nequivalent of the local currency costs. The Government will finance $250,000 equivalent or 20\npercent of the total TA cost. Detailed TA cost estimates are provided in the Table 1.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n7.\nThe  MOHSW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  ADB  will  engage  the  long  term\ninternational consultant. The operation research studies proposed by MOHSW will be reviewed\nand approved by ADB, which will engage consulting firms or individual consultants to implement\nthe studies.\n\n8.\nConsulting firms and / or individual consultants will be engaged to implement approved\nstudies,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The studies will\nneed  to  be  completed  within  36  months  of  TA  approval.  Workshops  and  seminars  will  be\norganized under the TA, by MOHSW and/or local government in the districts and the provinces\nto disseminate experiences and lessons learned.\n\n\f(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)\n(cid:2)(cid:6)\n(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:11)\n\nA S I A N     D E V E L O P M E N T     B A N K\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nR278-00\nCorrigendum 1\n27 November 2000\n\nCorrigendum to Document R278-00\n\nProposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant\n\nDecentralized Health Services Project\n(Indonesia)\n\nOn  page  65,  Appendix  12,  page  2  of  the  above  document,  please  amend\n\nparagraph 6 to read as follows:\n\n\u201cThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,250,000  equivalent,  of  which\n$790,000  will  be  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $460,000  equivalent  the  local\ncurrency  cost.

It  will\nprovide  models  for  addressing  the  needs  of  local  governments  serving  poor  and  nonpoor\ncommunities.  The  principal  criterion  for  selection  is  a  clear  commitment  from  the  district  and\nprovincial  government  to  address  health  sector  issues.  Despite  the  district-level  focus  of  the\nproject,  all  districts  in  the  selected  provinces  are  included  in  the  program  for  effective\ncoordination of health services that extend beyond the district boundary.\n\n3.\nThe project provinces and districts are diverse in sociocultural traditions, geography, and\nresource base. Aceh is a conservative province. Women's participation rate in the labor force is\nlow, and fertility rate is high. Ethnically distinct indigenous people live in the central highlands.\nWith  decentralization,  revenues  from  natural  gas  should  provide  good  resources  to  the  local\ngovernments.  Bali  enjoys  significant  revenue  from  tourism  but  under  decentralization,  tourism,\ntax revenues are not shared with the regions. In the health sector, there is scope for private for-\nprofit health services, but not in all districts. Paradoxically, local governments in Bali may have\nproblems  in  adequately  addressing  health  and  environmental  problems  (such  as  water  supply\nand  sanitation),  especially  for  poor  communities  away  from  the  tourist  areas.  Bengkulu,  an\nisolated  province  with  limited  resource  tax  base,  was  severely  hit  by  an  earthquake  in  June\n2000. Riau has a rich tax base from oil fields on the mainland and a dynamic industrial zone on\nBatam Island off Singapore. But the province also has large areas of peat swamp characterized\nby low fertility and difficult access, and small isolated islands in the Riau archipelago between\nthe  island  of  Sumatra,  Singapore,  and  Kalimantan.  Indigenous  peoples  are  found  in  the\nmountainous highlands along the central Sumatra mountain range and in the Riau archipelago.\nNorth  Sulawesi  has  an  active  not-for-profit  private  health  sector.  While  some  parts  of  the\nprovince have relatively prosperous communities, others are very poor. Central Sulawesi has a\nlimited  tax  base  and  small,  scattered  communities  along  the  narrow  coastal  strips  and  in  the\nhighland  areas.  It  is  the  most  ethnically  and  linguistically  complex  province  after  Irian  Jaya.\nSoutheast  Sulawesi  comprises  a  mix  of  old  communities  and  new  settlements.  Southeast\nSulawesi comprises a mix of old communities and new settlements, as it receives the overflow\nfrom land-short and historically disaster-prone South Sulawesi.\n\nB. \n\nConditions in the Project Province\n\nThe number of poor and incidence of poverty in the project provinces and in the country\n4.\nas  a  whole  are  shown  in  Table  A13.1.  Although  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  some  project\nprovinces  is  lower  than  the  national  average,  the  project  provinces  contain  a  significant\nproportion  of  Indonesia\u2019s  poor.  Furthermore,  in  a  number  of  provinces  such  as  Aceh,  Central\nSulawesi,  and  Southeast  Sulawesi,  conditions  have  continued  to  decline  due  to  the  social\nunrest or to an influx of internally displaced persons.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nTable A13.1: Incidence of Poverty and Number of Poor by Province, February 1999\n\nProvince\n\nUrban\n\nPercent\n\nRural\n\nPercent\n\nTotal\n\nPercent\n\nAceh\nBali\nBengkulu\nRiau\nCentral Sulawesi\nNorth Sulawesi\nSoutheast Sulawesi\nIndonesia\nSource:  Statistical Appendix, Assessment of Poverty in Indonesia October 2000.\n\n10.15\n9.42\n22.01\n9.06\n23.05\n12.88\n15.73\n19.41\n\n16.30\n7.94\n18.88\n16.95\n30.68\n20.33\n34.23\n26.03\n\nNumber\n(\u2018000)\n 497.5\n 143.3\n 204.6\n 447.0\n 473.7\n 401.8\n 436.2\n 32,332.2\n\nNumber\n(\u2018000)\n 104.7\n 114.5\n 97.7\n 142.7\n 125.7\n 102.9\n 68.7\n 15,642.5\n\nNumber\n(\u2018000)\n 602.1\n 257.8\n 302.3\n 589.7\n 599.4\n 504.6\n 504.9\n 47,974.7\n\n14.75\n8.53\n19.79\n14.00\n28.69\n18.19\n29.51\n23.43\n\nFollowing the crisis, rising food prices and declining real incomes drove up the share of\n5.\nexpenditure on food items across all income levels and in all provinces.

This  is\nindicated  by  the  change  in  the  poverty  gap  index  in  Table  A13.3.  The  intensity  or  severity  of\npoverty also increased.

It is equally important to focus on areas that contain a large\nnumber of poor. High incidence and a large number of poor do not necessarily go hand in hand,\nas provinces are equal in neither population nor area. Furthermore, while improvement in social\nindicators can often be expected to follow from income growth and reduction of income poverty,\nin some cases it may be necessary to make special efforts through targeted interventions. For\nexample,  Bali  has  a  high  proportion  of  children  affected  by  malnutrition  for  a  province  with  a\nfairly  low  incidence  of  income  poverty.  Similarly,  Aceh  has  the  most  serious  problem  of\nmalnutrition in children under 5, despite its lower than average poverty incidence. Less than 60\npercent  of  the  population  in  Bengkulu  and  Riau  have  access  to  safe  water.  Central  Sulawesi\nand Aceh have the lowest access to sanitation (Table A13.4).\n\nTable A13.4: Socioeconomic Overview of the Project Provinces\n\nProvince\n\nLife\nExpectancy\nat Birth\n1998\n(Yr)\n66.8\n68.78\n64.31\n67.01\n61.72\n67.33\n66.8\n65.6\n\nAceh\nBali\nBengkulu\nRiau\nCentral Sulawesi\nNorth Sulawesi\nSoutheast Sulawesi\nIndonesia\na  Severely and moderately underweight.\n\nMale\nLiteracy\nRate 1999\n(%)\n\nFemale\nLiteracy\nRate 1999\n(%)\n\n94.4\n88.5\n94.9\n95.7\n94.1\n96.6\n89.4\n90.6\n\n85.4\n71.9\n86.9\n89.5\n87.9\n96.3\n77.4\n79.3\n\nUnderweight\nChildren\nunder Five\nYears a\n(%)\n56.12\n22.64\n24.88\n37.42\n37.18\n37.54\n26.38\n35.40\n\nPop. with\nAccess to\nSafe Water\n1999\n(%)\n62.9\n89.0\n52.8\n40.5\n69.5\n75.7\n67.5\n74.3\n\nPop. with\nAccess to\nown\nSanitation\n1999 (%)\n51.0\n55.2\n56.5\n77.9\n41.1\n50.4\n56.2\n54.1\n\n8.\nAceh and Central Sulawesi are centers of internal unrest, while Southeast Sulawesi and\nNorth  Sulawesi  are  receiving  areas  for  displaced  persons  from  Maluku.

Poverty also results in unhealthy living conditions that have an immediate impact on\nhealth  and  nutrition  status.  The  poor  have  less  access  to  clean  water  and  adequate  nutrition.\nPoor women are more vulnerable to the consequences of ill health and are less able to guard\nthe health of their children. Poor health also diminishes learning and working capabilities, and\nreduces a person\u2019s competitiveness in the labor market.\n\nCommunicable diseases and vaccine-preventable infectious diseases typically affect the\n10.\npoor  more  than  the  nonpoor.  The  incidence  of  tuberculosis  is  much  higher  among  the  urban\npoor due to crowded conditions and poor diet. Diarrhea, a major cause of death in children, is\nmore  frequent  in  neighborhoods  with  limited  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation.  Inadequate\ninformation and opportunity costs prevent poor mothers to visit the health center, and children\nare  not  immunized  or  untreated  minor  illnesses  develop  major  consequences.  Access  to  safe\nwater  and  to  sanitation  facilities  in  the  project  provinces  by  and  large  is  lower  than  in  the\nnational  level.  The  lower  the  expenditure  level,  the  lower  the  access  to  clean  water  and\nsanitation facilities  (Table A13.5).\n\nTable A13.5: Access to Clean Water and Sanitation, 1999\n\nProvince\n\nAceh\nBali\nBengkulu\nRiau\nCentral Sulawesi\nNorth Sulawesi\nSoutheast Sulawesi\nIndonesia\n\nAccess to Clean Water\n\nQ4\n\nQ3\n\nQ1a Q2\nQ5 Total\n49.8 57.1 65.9 66.4 77.0 62.9\n73.3 84.2 85.4 88.4 95.1 89.0\n43.8 41.7 44.6 53.5 74.7 52.8\n20.9 24.7 32.9 38.2 57.5 40.5\n55.4 64.4 70.6 79.9 90.6 69.5\n58.3 71.1 77.9 81.1 82.7 75.7\n58.2 60.6 73.3 74.9 85.8 67.5\n62.9 69.2 73.1 78.2 88.1 74.3\n\nAccess to Own Sanitation\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Total\n47.7 42.7 47.5 55.4 65.0 51.0\n31.4 37.1 46.5 57.4 67.6 55.2\n35.9 45.7 57.7 63.7 69.2 56.5\n62.9 77.1 76.1 78.3 81.9 77.9\n23.3 32.3 42.8 54.1 71.1 41.1\n28.3 38.7 45.7 59.4 68.5 50.4\n49.7 54.4 62.8 56.4 67.6 56.2\n39.0 45.0 51.8 61.0 73.7 54.1\n\n   a Q1 refers to the lowest expenditure quintile, Q5 refers to the top 20 percent.\nSource:  Statistical Appendix, Assessment of Poverty in Indonesia October 2000.\n\nAccessibility  and  use  of  health  services  are  reflected  in  some  indicators,  including  the\n11.\npercentage  of  births  attended  by  qualified  health  staff  and  use  of  contraceptives.

Women\u2019s access to health care is important to women\u2019s direct health care needs as well\nas those of their family, as women tend to be responsible for the care of the young, the sick, and\nthe elderly. Thus, women\u2019s access to health care extends beyond the welfare of the individual to\nthat of the family as a whole. Maternal mortality is a major issue in Indonesia, with a maternal\nmortality  ratio  estimated  at  about  390  women\u2019s  deaths  per  100,000  live  births.  Maternal\nmorbidity also is significant, with an estimated 55.5 percent of pregnant women suffering from\nanemia. Family planning gives women greater control over their destiny. While the crisis did not\nresult  in  an  overall  decline  in  the  contraceptive  prevalence  rate,  gains  and  reversals,  were\nexperienced  in  the  project  provinces.

While\ndecentralization  can  ensure  that  health  programs  are  more  focused  on  local  needs,  local\nofficials, especially members of the local parliament must be educated in health care issues. For\nthis  reason,  the  decentralized  health  services  provides  a  strong  emphasis  on  advocacy  and\ntraining  of  local  decision  makers.  In  addition,  to  ensure  that  programs  are  not  driven  by  the\npriorities of the technocrats, the Project provides for preparation of district health plans through\na  participatory  process.  The  district  committee  will  be  established  to  include  women  and  men\nrepresentatives  from  the  communities.  The  task  of  the  health  committee  is  to  review  existing\nhealth services and access to them by the poor, nonpoor, women and men; and to identify local\nhealth  needs  by  gender.  The  Project  will  provide  better  access  to  health  services  to  the  poor,\nwomen,  and  children  by  strengthening  basic  health  programs,  reproductive  health,  family\nplanning, and nutrition.\n\nC. \n\nProject Design Components to Promote Poverty Targeting\n\n16.\nA number of measures were built into the design of the Project to ensure that the needs\nof women, the poor, and vulnerable groups including indigenous people are given priority and\nthat the poor have disproportionate access to the benefits.\n\n(i) \n\nDistrict  proposals  will  be  evaluated  for  funding  according  to  several  criteria\nincluding  how  the  proposed  investment  will  benefit  the  poor,  women,  and  the\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 13, page 7\n\nvulnerable. Training and technical support will be provided during the first phase\nof  project  implementation  to  assist  health  staff  and  the  community  in  assessing\nand reporting the impact of the proposal on the poor.\n\nProposals that include the needs of the local poor and vulnerable groups will be\ngiven  priority.  Priority  will  be  given  in  financing  primary  health  care  services,\nfamily planning, and availability of contraceptives.\n\nAdvocacy  and  information  campaigns  will  sensitize  local  decision  makers  and\nmembers  of  civil  society.  Training  will  sensitize  local  health  staff  to  the  specific\nneeds of the poor and vulnerable groups.\n\nAdvocacy, information campaigns, and training activities will highlight the special\nneeds  of  women  and  the  poor.  The  Project  will  finance  consulting  services  and\ntraining  on  gender  and  health,  including  appropriate  information,  education  and\ncommunication  materials.  Maternal  mortality  and  morbidity,  and  reproductive\nhealth  services  will  be  given  special  attention.  Benchmark  data  and  data\ncollected for project monitoring and performance evaluation will be disaggregated\nby gender.\n\nTraining activities target a gender balance of 50 percent female. This will not only\nimprove  skills  and  qualification  of  female  health  staff  but  also  ensure  that  more\nfemale  health  staff  are  ready  to  assist  and  answer  the  particular  needs  of\nwomen.\n\nPolicy  dialogue  will  emphasize  better  targeting  of  public  subsidies,  and  local\nmechanisms will be developed to continue the health safety net program linking\npublic subsidies to the poor and vulnerable groups.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 14 November 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Rupiah (Rp)\n$0.00011\nRp9,315\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "ADB\nAusAID\nBAPPEDA\n", "BAPPENAS\n", "BKKBN\nCPCU\nDHC\nDIU\nDPRD\nGAF\nGTZ\n", "HNSDP\nIEE\nJBIC\nJPS-BK\nMMR\nMOHSW\nNGO\nPCU\nPHP\nPM\nPPM\nSAF\nSDR\nSOE\nSPSDP\nSUSENAS\n", "TA\nTRT\nUNDP\nUNICEF\nUSAID\nWHO\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "Asian Development Bank\nAustralian Agency for International Development\nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Derah (Provincial Planning\nAgency)\nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (National\nDevelopment Planning Agency)\nNational Family Planning Coordinating Board\ncentral project coordinating unit\ndistrict health committee\ndistrict implementation unit\ndistrict parliament\nGeneral Allocation Fund\nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German\nAgency for Technical Cooperation)\nHealth and Nutrition Sector Development Program\ninitial environmental examination\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation\nSocial Safety Net Program for Health\nmaternal mortality rate\nMinistry of Health and Social Welfare\nnongovernment organization\nprovincial coordination unit\nProvincial Health Project\nperformance monitoring system\nprovincial project manager\nSpecial Allocation Fund\nspecial drawing right\nstatement of expenditure\nSocial Protection Sector Development Program\nSurvei Socio-Ekonomi Nasional (National Social and Economic\nSurvey)\ntechnical assistance\ntechnical review team\nUnited Nations Development Programme\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund\nUnited States Agency for International Development\nWorld Health Organization\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "For 2000, the fiscal year (FY) of the Government covers 1 April to 31 December;\nfor 2001 onward, the FY will cover 1 January to 31 December.\nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.\n", "CONTENTS\n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY\n", "MAP\n", "I.\n", "II.\n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "III.\n", "BACKGROUND\n", "IV.\n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n", "Sector Description\nGovernment Policies and Plans\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\nLessons Learned\nADB Sector Strategy\nPolicy Dialogue\n", "Rationale\nObjectives and Scope\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nImplementation Arrangements\nThe Executing Agency\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\nTechnical Assistance\n", "Economic and Financial Analyses\nProject Sustainability\nEnvironment\nSocial Dimensions\nRisks and Safeguards\n", "V.\n", "PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n", "VI.\n", "ASSURANCES\n", "Specific Assurances\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n", "VII.\n", "RECOMMENDATION\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG.\nH.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\n", "A.\nB.\n", "Page\n", "ii\n", "vi\n", "1\n", "1\n", "2\n", "2\n8\n11\n13\n14\n15\n", "16\n", "16\n17\n22\n22\n23\n28\n28\n29\n", "29\n", "29\n31\n31\n32\n32\n", "33\n", "33\n35\n", "35\n", "36\n"]}
