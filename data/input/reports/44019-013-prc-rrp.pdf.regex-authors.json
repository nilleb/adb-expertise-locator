I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hubei Huangshi Urban Pollution Control and \nEnvironmental Management Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  aims  to  promote  environmentally  sustainable  and  socioeconomically \ninclusive urban development in Huangshi, Hubei Province, by upgrading urban environmental \ninfrastructure and services. The project will support wastewater management, lake rehabilitation, \nsludge treatment, solid waste management, and related urban environmental services.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The project is located in Huangshi, southeastern Hubei Province, 80 kilometers (km) \nsoutheast of Wuhan, the provincial capital.3 The city is spread over floodplain on the south bank \nof the Yangtze River, having developed around three lakes: Cihu, Qingshan, and Qinggang. In \n2010, the population of the municipality was 2.43 million, with 765,000 living in the urban area.4 \nHuangshi\u2019s initial development was based on mining, and its associated secondary industries \nhave  driven  the  city\u2019s  economic  development.  Resource  depletion  and  the  need  for  more \nbalanced and sustainable development prompted the Huangshi municipal government (HMG) to \nrenew the city by upgrading its industry, relocating polluting industries outside of the central \nurban area, and developing tertiary industries and an enabling investment environment. This will \nhelp Huangshi strengthen its development potential as a core secondary city in Hubei Province, \nsupporting balanced regional development in the province. Huangshi is a part of the \u2015Wuhan+8 \nmegacity cluster,\u2016 which the government promotes as a pilot administrative zone for balanced, \nenvironment-friendly economic development within the cluster. \n \n4.  Challenges.  Huangshi  faces  environmental  and  urban  development  challenges \nreflecting  its  historical  reliance  on  heavy  industry  and  inadequate  investment  in  urban \ninfrastructure. General neglect of urban pollution allowed untreated industrial and domestic \nwastewater to flow into urban lakes. The city\u2019s solid waste management is inadequate and the \nsludge from wastewater treatment plants is untreated. Urban channels and lakes are blocked by \npolluted sediments and accumulated solid waste. The three lakes in the city became polluted \nand degraded, endangering public health and safety, particularly for the poor who often live near \npolluted  inland  waterways  and  in  areas  with  deficient  urban  services.  Inadequate  urban \ninfrastructure constrains sustainable urban development and limits Huangshi\u2019s ability to promote \ninvestment and support balanced regional development in Hubei.  \n \n5.  Wastewater. An estimated 131,000 cubic meters (m3) of untreated urban wastewater is \ndischarged daily into the city\u2019s three lakes and the Yangtze River.5 The project will support the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Hubei Huangshi Urban Pollution Control and \nEnvironmental Management Project. Manila (TA 7607-PRC). \n3  Huangshi is the 11th largest municipality in Hubei Province by population and 9th by gross domestic product. \n4  Huangshi municipality has five urban districts (Huangshigang, Tieshan, Xialu, Xisaishan, and a development zone), \none county-level city (Daye), and one county (Yangxin). \n5  The reported coverage rate of wastewater collection and treatment differs depending on the data source and \ncalculation method. It is 71% based on the ratio of wastewater flowing into existing wastewater treatment plants \n(167,000 m3 per day) to total wastewater generation in the catchment (234,000 m3 per day). However, this does ", "2 \nrehabilitation  and  extension  of  the  existing  wastewater  network  system  to  remove \nmisconnections and intercept urban wastewater more effectively, thereby improving collection \nefficiency and mitigating pollution loads into water bodies downstream. The project will also \nsupport the construction of a new wastewater collection and treatment system to serve the \nnewly developed urban area of Hexi.  \n \n6.  Lake. Water quality in Huangshi\u2019s three lakes is severely polluted, to class V or worse.6 \nThe lakes are affected by organic pollution, nutrients, and heavy metals. Sediments are highly \ncontaminated with heavy metals, particularly near discharge points into lakes. The project will \nsupport an integrated multifunctional approach to lake improvement that removes contaminated \nsediments, constructs engineered wetlands and lake embankments, and interconnects urban \nwater bodies. These interventions are designed to (i) improve water quality, (ii) restore lake \necology  and  healthy  hydraulic  circulation,  (iii)  improve  the  lakes\u2019  retention  capacity  and \nresilience under climate change, and (iv) enhance public amenity.  \n \n7.  Sludge. The project will tackle the emerging environmental challenge of handling the \nsludge generated in greater quantities as wastewater collection and treatment expands.7 At \npresent, untreated sludge is dumped directly to the municipal landfill. While supporting the \ntreatment system for contaminated sludge in the short term, the project will help the HMG \ndevelop a mid- and long-term strategic plan to reduce sludge production, stabilize its content, \nand find beneficial uses for it.8  \n \n8.  Solid waste. Challenges facing solid waste management in Huangshi are (i) inefficient \ncollection and transfer facilities, (ii) excessive waste generated without sorting or recycling, and \n(iii) inadequate disposal capacity for the volume. While the HMG will expand the capacity of \ndisposal facilities to meet future demand, the project will upgrade the existing collection and \ntransfer system to enhance collection efficiency to comply with environmental standards, build \nnew collection and transfer stations to serve an expanded urban area, and pilot a sorting and \nrecycling scheme with community participation to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste.  \n \n9.  Strategic  fit  and  lessons  learned.  The  project  will  help  Huangshi  (i)  promote \nenvironmentally sustainable urban development; (ii) improve living conditions by providing better \nurban services and a cleaner environment to urban residents, including the poor; and (iii) \nenhance  inclusive  socioeconomic  growth  with  expanded  tertiary  industries,  an  attractive \ninvestment environment, and more employment. By promoting sustainable and environment-\nfriendly urban development, the project aligns with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u2013\n2015 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC.9  It promotes economic growth that is \nenvironmentally sustainable and inclusive, in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.10 It contributes to \n                                                                                                                                                       \nnot indicate actual connectivity and collection in Huangshi, where many sewer networks are combined with storm \nwater and misconnection and infiltration are common. A more representative method based on pollution loads \nindicates a collection rate of 44%. \n6  PRC water quality standards have five classes covering 24 basic quality parameters. Class I is pristine; class II is \nfor high-value fish production areas and spawning habitats; class III is suitable for urban water supply; class IV is \nsuitable for irrigation and recreation; and class V is polluted and not recommended for human consumption or \nagricultural use. \n7  About 250 tons of sewage sludge will be generated daily in 2015, based on the projected increase of wastewater \nquantity and its pollution loads.   \n8  Two sampling tests during project preparation found sewage sludge to be contaminated with high concentrations of \nheavy metals from industry, which limits options for its disposal and reuse. Sludge quality is expected to improve in \nthe long term as a result of the project, which will enable other solutions for disposal and beneficial reuse.  \n9  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nMillennium  Development  Goal  7  by  improving  sanitation.  It  conforms  with  ADB\u2019s  Water \nOperational Plan,which encourages expanded wastewater management and integrated water \n \nresource management.11 It builds on ADB\u2019s experience and lessons from previous projects in \nHubei 12  and  other  projects  for  urban  development,  water  resource  management,  and \ndevelopment in small and medium-sized cities, as well as from knowledge generated in policy-\noriented studies on lake rehabilitation13 and sludge treatment.14  \n \n10.  Demonstration features. The project will (i) demonstrate an integrated approach to \nurban  pollution  control  and  environmental  management  that  combines  reducing  upstream \npollution  loads  by  rehabilitating  and  extending  wastewater  and  solid  waste  systems  with \nimproving downstream water quality by rehabilitating lake ecology and hydraulic circulation, \nwhich will significantly improve water quality in the three lakes; (ii) analyze the cumulative \nimpact of pollution loads and modeling of surface water circulation to support the design of the \nproject; and (iii) pilot a scheme for solid waste sorting and recycling with community participation \nthat will show, albeit on a small scale, the reduce\u2013reuse\u2013recycle approach. The pilot scheme \nwill be replicated in other communities in Huangshi. The project also has great potential to \nbecome  a  model  of  integrated  pollution  control  and  ecological  rehabilitation  applicable  to \npolluted and blocked urban lakes in other small and medium-sized cities along the Yangtze and \nelsewhere in the PRC. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be environmentally sustainable and socioeconomically inclusive urban \ndevelopment in Huangshi. The outcome will be improved urban environmental infrastructure \nand management services in Huangshi.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.

DUE DILIGENCE \n17.  The project will benefit 765,000 urban residents in Huangshi, improving environmental \nand  socioeconomic  conditions  by  (i)  reducing  pollution  and  improving  the  management  of \nsurface water bodies, (ii) expanding and improving urban services for wastewater, sludge, and \nsolid waste, (iii) making the urban environment more environmentally and ecologically friendly, \nand (iv) improving the investment environment and employment.  \n \nA.  Technical  \n18.  Project design accommodates local conditions and accords with PRC design guidelines \nand local regulations. Moderate design for wastewater and sludge treatment and for solid waste \ntransfer suit the natural environment and are adequate to attract market competition. Lake \nrehabilitation  is  well  integrated  and  sequenced  with  other  project  components.  Detailed \nengineering design will comply with up-to-date urban design standards and specifications and \nadopt international best practices. A capacity-building program for related urban services is \nincluded in the project. A detailed description of components is in the PAM. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  Economic.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that \nproject components use least-cost options to support Huangshi\u2019s long-term urban development \nplans. Cost\u2013benefit analysis reveals the project\u2019s overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nat 12.6% and the overall economic net present value at CNY45.2 million. The EIRR for each \n ", "7 \ncomponent is computed at 12.5% for wastewater, 12.2% for lake rehabilitation and hydraulic \ncirculation,  22.1%  for  sludge,  and  15.2%  for  solid  waste,  each  exceeding  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The project is sensitive to changes in either costs or \nbenefits, as switching values show the project remaining viable only with a 4.0% cost increase \nor a 3.9% benefit decrease. However, all EIRRs are considered substantially underestimated, \nas all project components have significant benefits not easily  quantified.18 Economic costs \ninclude  capital  costs  for  five  components,  physical  contingencies,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. Economic benefits are largely based on estimates of willingness-to-pay as \nderived from the contingent valuation survey conducted during project preparation.19 \n \n20.  Financial. The analysis of the financial viability of revenue-generating components\u2014\nwastewater, sludge, and solid waste\u2014finds a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the \ncombined wastewater and sludge components at 2.9% and for the solid waste component at \n3.2%, which compares favorably with the 1.9% weighted average costs of capital. A tariff \nincrease is proposed for both wastewater and solid waste to recover operation and maintenance \ncosts  and  debt  servicing  by  2020.  The  analysis  of  existing  tariffs  and  cost-recovery \narrangements shows full cost recovery to be unrealistic in the short term without government \nsubsidy. However, the project will facilitate progressive tariff increases through the capacity-\ndevelopment  component,  following  the  PRC  process  for  public  participation  in  water  tariff \nreform. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR for wastewater and sludge is generally \nrobust but sensitive to revenue decrease, and the FIRR for solid waste robust to adverse \nchanges. The wastewater tariff will equal 0.5% of an average household\u2019s income, and the solid \nwaste tariff 0.2%, or 1.5% and 0.5% of a poor household\u2019s income\u2014far below the benchmark of \n4.0%.  The  proposed  tariff  increase  is  within  the  amount  beneficiaries  are  willing  to  pay. \nFinancial sustainability analysis indicates that the HMG presents acceptable fiscal risk regarding \nits ability to provide counterpart funds and service project debts. Its contributions to the project \nwill be less than 0.5% of its fiscal revenue over the project construction period, and debt service \nwill not exceed 1.1% of fiscal revenue during the operation period. The nonrevenue-generating \ncomponent\u2014river  rehabilitation\u2014is  therefore  considered  both  financially  sustainable  and \naffordable.  \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Hubei provincial government, the HMG, and Huangshi Urban Construction Investment \nand  Development  Company  (HUCIDC).  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM, including providing support and training on ADB policies \nand  procedures,  engaging  a  tendering  agent  and  project  implementation  consultant  to \nstrengthen  procurement,  and  involving  the  Huangshi  Discipline  Investigation  Bureau  in \nprocurement.  The  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that,  although  the  project \nmanagement office (PMO) and HUCIDC have sufficient financial management capacity and \nproject management experience, they lack sufficient experience in managing ADB projects and \nrequire a component to build their capacity to implement the project in line with ADB policies \nand procedures. \n                                                \n18 The use of dredged materials and increased economic activity and employment from the project are not counted in \neconomic  analysis.  Improved  water  quality  and  urban  environment  are  probably  not  fully  reflected  in  the \nwillingness-to-pay survey because of their intangibility.  \n19  Additional benefits from the tertiary treatment of wastewater and primary treatment of storm water by engineered \nwetlands were quantified and added into the lake rehabilitation and hydraulic circulation component.  \n ", "8 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Poverty and social assessment during project preparation included a household survey, \ncommunity and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The project will directly \nbenefit over 765,000 urban residents, of whom 4.7% are poor, by improving living conditions, \nurban services, public health, and the urban environment. The poor in particular will benefit from \nthe improved wastewater and solid waste services and lake environment as they tend to live in \nareas with deficient urban services. The project will create 1,823 jobs during construction and \n593 jobs during operation. Employment targets for vulnerable groups and women are included \nin the design and monitoring framework and loan covenants. A social development action plan \nhas been prepared and will be implemented by the HMG and HUCIDC. A labor reemployment \nplan for sanitation workers affected by the mechanization of solid waste management and its \ntransfer from the HMG to local companies has been prepared with extensive consultation.20 It is \nsupported by a loan covenant and will be implemented by the HMG. \n \n23.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \nhas been prepared with agreed activities and indicators. The analysis of the social survey and \nfocus group discussions reveals that women are primarily responsible for disposing of domestic \nwastewater and solid waste, paying utility bills, and caring for the sick and elderly. Improving \nsanitary conditions through more effective wastewater, sludge, and solid waste management \nwill benefit women through improved productivity and reduced illness, with its associated time \nand cost burdens. The improved lake environment and green space will provide recreational \nareas for women and children. Women\u2019s participation in (i) public consultations for strategic \nplanning and facility design, (ii) public awareness activities for environmental protection and \npublic health, (iii) public hearings on wastewater and solid waste tariff increases, and (iv) pilot \nsolid waste sorting and recycling will strengthen the activities and enhance project sustainability, \nas women are directly affected. The gender action plan has targets for women\u2019s employment, \nparticipation, and capacity building supported by loan covenants and consulting support for \nimplementation and monitoring. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  Environment. The project is environment category A, the classification mainly triggered \nby  the  lake  rehabilitation  and  hydraulic  circulation  component.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment\u2014prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), circulated \nto ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, and posted on the ADB website\u2014concluded that the project would \nhave substantial environmental benefits and that its potential adverse environmental impacts \ncould  be  mitigated  through  the  environmental  management  plan.  Significant  environmental \nbenefits are (i) improved water quality in the three lakes in terms of organic pollutants and \nnutrient levels, (ii) restored lake ecology, and (iii) improved sanitation and public health through \nthe improved and expanded management of urban wastewater, sludge, and solid waste.  \n \n25.  Major potential environment issues relate to (i) lake sediment dredging, noise and air \npollution, surface water pollution, and occupational and community health and safety during \nconstruction; (ii) noise and air quality impacts from solid waste transfer stations, wastewater and \nsludge treatment facilities, and pumping stations at some sensitive areas during operation; (iii) \npossible impacts on the Yangtze River from the discharge of effluent from the wastewater \ntreatment plant; and (iv) health and safety concerns during the operation of wastewater and \n                                                \n20  The resettlement plan includes the labor reemployment plan and will be monitored by an external monitor. \n ", "9 \nsludge treatment plants and solid waste transfer stations. Mitigation to reduce these impacts \nwill,  as  spelled  out  in  the  environmental  management  plan,  reduce  and  control  the \ncontamination  of  the  aquatic  ecosystem  with  sediments,  adopt  performance  standards  for \ndredging, and regularly monitor the project\u2019s environmental performance during construction \nand operation. The Huangshi Environmental Protection Bureau will guide and monitor the PMO, \nHUCIDC, and contractors in implementing the plan. Environmental management is supported \nby loan covenants and capacity development under the project. The HMG disclosed relevant \nenvironmental information to affected people, and the results and findings of the consultation \nwere used to modify the environmental impact assessment and project design. Consultation and \npublic  participation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation,  and  any  environmental \ncomplaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism \nestablished for the project. \n \n26.  Resettlement. The project is resettlement category A. It will affect 5 districts, 11 towns, \nand 26 villages and communities of Huangshi city. A total of 898 mu of land will be permanently \nacquired, including 309 mu of collective land and 589 mu of state-owned land. A further 1,450 \nmu will be temporarily occupied during project implementation. 21 Land acquisition will affect 193 \nhouseholds with 766 persons. A total of 44,050 square meters (m2) of residences and 8,208 m2 \nof nonresidential structures will be demolished, affecting 228 households with 853 persons and \nthree enterprises with 26 employees. A resettlement plan prepared in line with ADB's Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009)22 and endorsed by the HMG, was disclosed to affected people in the \nlocal language. The resettlement plan will be finalized in line with the detailed engineering \ndesign and detailed measurement survey, disclosed to affected people in the local language, \nand submitted to ADB for approval prior to the awarding of civil works contracts. Compensation \nfor lost assets and resettlement allowances will be paid to affected people, and livelihood \nrehabilitation  will  be  arranged  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  prior  to  the \ncommencement of the related civil works. The PMO and HUCIDC will assume responsibility for \nplanning,  implementing,  financing,  and  reporting  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism was established.  \n \n27.  Indigenous peoples. The project is indigenous peoples category C. In Huangshi, ethnic \nminorities represent about 0.1% of the total population. They are socially and economically well \nintegrated and do not congregate in any particular residential area. No ethnic minorities are \naffected by land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 The project has no unusual technical risks. \nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation delays due to the  Early mobilization of a tendering agent and implementation \nlimited experience of the project  consultants to provide technical support in procurement, contract \nmanagement office and HUCIDC in  management, disbursement, and financial management \nprojects financed by multilateral \n                                                \n21  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2).  \n22 In addition, a resettlement due diligence report was prepared for five existing  wastewater treatment plants \nassociated with the project. \n23  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nagencies  Training on ADB guidelines and procedures \nUnderachievement of wastewater  Implementation of works after the comprehensive network survey \ncollection efficiency due to delay in  Assurances on synchronized implementation under the project and \nother government projects  other government projects, and regular reporting on progress \nWeak coordination and  Coordination mechanism between agencies \nsynchronization between agencies  Close project monitoring, frequent site inspections, and regular \ncoordination meetings \nCoordination support from implementation consultants \nDelay in land acquisition approvals  Expeditious implementation of detailed design and detailed \nand implementation  measurement surveys, and finalization of the resettlement plan \nEarly availability of compensation funding for affected people  \nStrict operational compliance with the resettlement plan \nUnsustainable operation and  Support for management improvement such as wastewater asset \nmaintenance of infrastructure  management and online monitoring system \ncomponents for lack of capacity or  Capacity building and institutional strengthening support \nbudget, and delay in tariff increase \nAssurances on operation and maintenance budget provisions and \ntariff increase for cost recovery \nSupport for annual tariff reviews and public awareness program \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HUCIDC = Huangshi Urban Construction and Investment Development Company.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n29.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. The government has also agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Hubei Huangshi Urban Pollution Control \nand Environmental Management Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n23 October 2012 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020 (baseline 2010)    Assumption \nEnvironmentally  Water quality is improved from  Annual environmental  Environmental protection \nsustainable and  class V to class IV in the lakes  monitoring report of the  plan and other urban plans \nsocioeconomically  Cihu, Qingshan, and  Huangshi Environmental  under the Twelfth Five-Year \ninclusive urban  Qinggang for organic  Protection Bureau  Plan are effectively \ndevelopment in  pollutants.  implemented as scheduled. \nHuangshi  \nAverage annual per capita  Annual statistics from the  Risk \nincome of urban households is  Huangshi Statistics  Development pressures \nincreased by 10% per annum  Bureau  outpace planned \nfrom CNY15,460.  infrastructure development. \n \nUnemployment is reduced by  Annual statistics from the \n0.2% and maintained at no  Huangshi Statistics \nmore than 5.0%.
