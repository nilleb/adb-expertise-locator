Planning Commission \n(footnote  2)  is  projecting  a  potential  debt  financing  shortfall  of  $350  billion  in  infrastructure \ninvestment  over  the  plan.  This  deficit  could  be  addressed  by  tapping  into  India\u2019s  large  resource \npool of insurance and pension funds through bond markets. However, these funds have not been \nutilized for financing infrastructure; a chief constraint being that the statutory requirements require \nthat  these  funds  invest  only  in  assets  rated  AA  or  above.  However,  infrastructure  assets  are \ntypically rated BBB\u2013 to A, at best. The proposed facility by providing credit enhancement will raise \nthe  credit  rating  of  infrastructure  project  bonds  to  the  required  AA  rating,  thereby  providing  the \ncritical missing step required to mobilize infrastructure financing from pension and insurance funds \nand promote development of the domestic corporate debt market.   \n\n3. \nThe facility has been developed  in partnership with  India Infrastructure Finance Company \nLimited (IIFCL) and it dovetails other public\u2013private partnership (PPP) infrastructure development \ninitiatives  by  the  government  and  ADB  to  support  PPP  enablers3  and  provide  long-term  project \nfinance.4  Under  the  facility,  IIFCL,  which  is  a  domestic  AAA  entity,  will  issue  PCGs  in support  of \ninfrastructure  project  bonds  and  ADB  will  assume  a  portion  of  the  credit  risk  on  the  underlying \nproject from IIFCL by issuing it a counter guarantee.5 The PCGs will raise the rating of the project \nbonds  to  the  AA  level,  which  will  enable  domestic  institutional  investors  to  invest  in  the  credit \nenhanced  bonds.6  In  addition  to  IIFCL,  ADB  will  seek  to  partner  with  other  eligible  domestic \nfinancial institutions, namely participating financial institution (PFIs). Through the facility, ADB will \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n2  Government  of  India,  Planning  Commission.  2011.

New Delhi.   \n\n3  ADB  has  provided  seven  PPP-related  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  to  support  initiatives  that  have  included \ncapacity  development,  project  identification,  and  project  development  and  structuring  at  both  the  state  and  central \nlevels. Additional TA has also been provided for project preparation and preparing project feasibility studies.  \n\n4  ADB. 2007.

It \nis also specifically mandated to provide long-term financing for PPP infrastructure projects and also develop innovative \nfinancing instruments and in particular, promote and develop a credit enhancement product for infrastructure financing.     \n\n6  TA has demonstrated the commercial viability of PCGs in India.

After  the  first  successful  pilot  demonstration  transactions,  and  as  IIFCL  and \nother  PFIs  develop  the  necessary  capacity  to  provide  credit  enhancement  on  their  own,  the \ncomfort  of  ADB\u2019s  risk  participation  and  involvement  will  be  less  relevant  and  ADB  can  gradually \ndisengage from participating in the transactions.  \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nInfrastructure Financing Issues \n\nCommercial  banks.  PPP  infrastructure  projects  in  India  depend  on  bank  loans  for  over \n4. \n80% of their debt.7 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has indicated with concern that the  annual \ngrowth rate of bank exposure to infrastructure  was around 40% in FY2010.8 While the growth in \nexposure has moderated more recently to around 10%, with the current exposure standing around \n$100  billion  to  the  infrastructure  sector,  banks  are  fast  approaching  sector  exposure  limits.  With \ncountry\u2019s  private  sector  debt  requirements  at  around  $350  billion  for  infrastructure,  meeting  this \nfinancing  need  will  require  banks  to  significantly  expand  their  infrastructure  portfolios  in  an \nenvironment  where  they  face  severe  constraints.  First,  the  banks  have  already  reached  close  to \nmaximum sector exposure limit of 15%.9 Second, financing long-term infrastructure loans increase \nthe  asset-liability  management  (ALM)  mismatches  in  banks,  due  to  their  funding  coming  largely \nfrom short-term deposit base, which is a potential source of macroeconomic vulnerability.10 Third, \nthe structural mismatch in tenor is passed on to the borrower in the form of loan rates being reset \nevery  1\u20133 years,  carrying  a  potential  increased financing  cost  which  the borrower  cannot  always \npass  on,  which  increases  project  risk  and  in  turn  can  result  in  credit  risk  for  banks.  Taken  as  a \nwhole,  these factors  strongly  suggest  that  infrastructure  projects  cannot  rely  exclusively  on  bank \nloans and need alternate sources of capital.  \n\n5. \nInsurance funds. Insurance companies and pension and provident funds with investment \nfunds  of  around  $190  billion  and  around  $80  billion  respectively  in  FY2011  are  ideal  sources  of \nlong-term  funds  for  the  infrastructure  sector.11  Under  the  norms  prescribed  by  the  Insurance \nRegulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) of India, insurance funds should invest 15% of their \ncontrolled  funds  in  infrastructure  and  social  sectors.  However,  the  flow  of  credit  from  insurance \nfunds to infrastructure has been only around 7%\u20139% in the case of life insurance companies, and \nwhile larger in the case of non-life insurers, there is almost no flow of funds into actual projects.12 \nHowever,  the  insurance  industry  penetration  in  India  was  only  around  5%  in  FY2010,  and  with \npremiums growing rapidly (at around 11% in FY2011 and 23% in FY2010), there is an immense \nopportunity for the industry to expand outreach and generate resources which can be invested in \ninfrastructure. A critical factor for the shortfall in investment lies in IRDA guidelines that require a \nminimum  domestic  AA  rating,  from  domestic  rating  agencies,  for  investment  assets  before  they \ncan  qualify  for  such  investment.13  Infrastructure  projects  are  characterized  by  nonrecourse  or \n\n                                                \n7  Banks refer to scheduled commercial banks, which are those banks which have been included in the Second Schedule \nof RBI Act, 1934. These banks satisfy the criteria laid down in section 42 (6) (a) of the RBI Act. Non-scheduled banks \nare mostly cooperative banks that are not active in infrastructure.  \n\n8  RBI. 2010. Financial Stability Report. Mumbai. \n9  RBI. 2011. Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2010\u20132011. Mumbai. \n10 RBI  data  indicates  that,  the  ALM  positive  gap  (positive  differential  in  the  tenors  of  assets  over  liabilities)  in  >5-year \n\nbucket constituted 42% of the total ALM positive gap, followed by 3\u20135 years (31%) and 1\u20133 years (27%). \n\n11 Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. 2011. Annual Report. Hyderabad. \n12 Even  though  these  funds  were  invested  in  the  broad  infrastructure  sector,  they  were  largely  absorbed  by  dedicated \ninfrastructure finance companies through bonds issued at the corporate level, with little if any going into direct project \nfinance. \n\n13 This is a requirement of the IRDA (Investment) Regulations (Amendment), 2001. As per IRDA, the investment assets \nshall be of a grade not less than AA based on their current rating. When investments with AA ratings are not available, \nan  investment  committee  may,  for  reasons  recorded  in  investment  committee  minutes,  approve  investments  with \nratings of not less than A+, with A+ investments kept to the minimum. \n\n \n\n\f        3 \n\nlimited recourse financing and present multiple financing risks. During construction, risks relate to \nconstruction, land acquisition, financing and cost escalations, and enforcement of property rights. \nDue to these risks, projects at inception typically get a low credit rating in the BBB- category. Even \nafter  commercial  operations  begin,  (defined  as  commercial  operation  date  [COD]),  ratings  may \ntypically  go  up  to  BBB+  or  A,  at  best,  as  demand,  off  taker  and  regulatory  risk  remain.  Thus, \ninsurance  funds  are  unable  to  meet  investment  goals  in  infrastructure  due  to  non-availability  of \nsufficiently rated assets.14   \n\n6. \nThe above circumstances strongly suggest the importance of developing the project bond \nmarket by establishing a credit enhancement product to improve infrastructure project bond credit \nratings,  and  create  an  investable  asset  class for  insurance  and  pension  funds.  The  funds  raised \nthrough this mechanism will be used to prepay bank debt before its scheduled maturity and thus \nfree  up  bank  resources  to  lend  to  new  greenfield  projects.  India\u2019s  banks  have  enough  project \nfinance  experience  and  risk  appetite  to  take  on  greenfield  project  risk.  Prepayment  of  bank  debt \nthrough bond issuances by projects that have completed 2 years of operations post COD, implies \nthat banks will only have around 4 years of exposure to the projects (2 years of construction and 2 \nyears  of  operation)  which  is  more  in  line  with  their  liability  profile  in  terms  of  short-term  bank \ndeposits. This will mitigate their overall ALM imbalances.  For their part, long-term investors such \nas insurance companies and pension funds that invest in the credit-enhanced bonds will take on \nexposure to the projects through long-term bonds that match their long-term liabilities. Further, as \nthese bonds would be less risky, they could have greater liquidity and may be traded. Issuers will \nlook  to  refinance  bank  loans  at  lower  rates  when  construction  risks  disappear.  The  projects  will \nalso  benefit  from  greater  interest  rate  certainty.  While  banks  lend  at  floating  rates  linked  to  the \ninterest rate cycle, bonds carry a fixed-rate making funding costs predictable. \n\n  \n\n \n\nb. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nThe facility is based on almost 2 years of comprehensive policy dialogue with IIFCL,  the \n7. \nMinistry  of  Finance, the Planning  Commission, the  RBI,  investment  banks,  institutional  investors, \nand  project  developers.15  The  results  of  this  dialogue,  which  built  stakeholder  consensus,  have \nbeen (i) periodic recapitalization of IIFCL by the government; (ii) Cabinet approval to declare IIFCL \na  nonbank  finance  company  and  bring  it  under  RBI  supervision;  (iii)  approval  of  IIFCL\u2019s  PCG \nscheme  for  pilot  transactions  by  IIFCL\u2019s  board;  (iv)  government  approval  for  IIFCL  to  undertake \npilot  PCG  transactions  for  over  $700  million,  leading  to  the  formal  launch  of  IIFCL\u2019s  credit \nenhancement  scheme  by  the  finance  minister  on  5  January  2012;  (v)  capacity  development  on \nproject credit appraisal and due diligence within IIFCL to enable it to undertake PCG transactions; \nand (vi) drafting of a memorandum of understanding between IIFCL and insurance companies for \nthe  latter  to  absorb  credit-enhanced  bonds.  The  dialogue  was  sustained  by  ADB\u2019s  Capacity \nDevelopment TA for IIFCL16 which also provided guidance on guarantee structuring and indicated \nthat a first-loss PCG was particularly suitable.17 \n\n2. \n\nDesign \n\nThe figure illustrates the structure of the PCGs expected to be issued under the facility.  \n\n                                                \n14 Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 IIFCL  is  a  large  client  of  ADB,  having  received  loans  for  $1.2  billion  under  two  multitranche  financial  facilities  to \n\nsupport long-term debt financing for infrastructure projects (footnote 4). \n\n16 Attached  to  ADB.  2007.

Third, ADB will provide a counter guarantee to the \nPFI for up to 50% of the exposure assumed by it under the first loss guarantee.  In an enforcement \nsituation, the PFI will have access to the security of the underlying project assets, the proceeds of \nwhich will be shared with ADB on a pro rata basis. ADB will not have recourse to the sovereign or \nthe  PFI  in  the  event  of  default  by  the  SPV  on  the  bond  obligations.  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  fee  will \ndepend  on  the  underlying  project  risk  and  guarantee  structure.  The  first  loss  structure  has  been \ndeveloped with guidance from rating agencies and is the most efficient way to lower the probability \nof  default to bond  holders  and uplift  credit of the underlying  bonds. It  essentially  acts  as  a  credit \nbuffer  to  bondholders  and  is  attractive  to  ADB  as  it  leverages  scarce  ADB  resources.  A  small \namount of first loss guarantee for payments to bondholders (typically in the range of 20%\u201350% of \nthe outstanding principal)\u2014of which ADB will take only up to half\u2014can raise a bond\u2019s rating to the \nneeded  AA  level.  This  is  a  better  use  of  resources  than  a  full  credit  wrap  covering  100%  of  the \namount of the bonds.18  \n\n10. \nA  critical  aspect  of  ADB\u2019s  development  objective  under  the  facility  is  the  creation  of  a \ntemplate for replicating similar first-loss guarantees by IIFCL and other PFIs. ADB and the relevant \nPFIs will jointly (i) select projects to be supported under the facility, (ii) conduct due diligence of the \nprojects, and (iii) price and structure the credit enhancement of the project. The pilot transactions \nwill develop precedents for project documentation, bond documentation, guarantees, due diligence \nrequirements,  pricing  analysis,  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  objective  is  to  enable \nADB\u2019s counterparties to provide credit enhancement products on their own after ADB withdraws. \n \n\n                                                \n18  A  technical  note  on  the  first-loss  guarantee  to  provide  meaningful  credit  enhancement  is  provided  in  Guarantee \n\nStructure and Sizing (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f        5 \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n11. \nThe impact will be the expansion of the debt market in India for infrastructure finance and \nproducts beyond bank loans. The facility will promote the diversification of infrastructure financing \nsources and support development of the bond market, complementing initiatives taken by RBI and \nthe  government.19    Specifically,  the  facility  will  bring  new  lenders  into  infrastructure  project \nfinancing,  including  insurance  and  pension  funds,  thereby  diversifying  funding  options  for  these \nprojects.  Fixed  rate  bonds  will  replace  floating  rate  SCB  loans20  that  have  periodic  interest  rate \nresets, thereby reducing project risk.     \n\n \n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n12. \nThe outcome of the facility will be the demonstration of a commercially viable and replicable \nmodel  for  undertaking  credit  enhancement  of  infrastructure  project  bonds  in  India.  Risk-based \npricing  of the guarantee  facility  will  set  market  benchmarks  and  result  in  efficient  price  discovery \nand  sustainability.  It  will  also  lead  to  the  matching  of  long-dated  infrastructure  assets  with  long-\ndated  insurance  and  pension  fund  liabilities.  While  the  bonds  under  the  first  demonstration \ntransaction  will  be  privately  placed,  the  possibility  of  public  bond  placement  will  be  explored  for \ntransactions that follow under the facility. The pilot transactions will demonstrate the viability of the \nPCG product in the infrastructure bond market and the precedents developed in the pilot phase will \nfacilitate the rolling out of the credit enhancement product in an effective manner. Successful pilot \ntransactions will in particular (i) enable IIFCL to mainstream credit enhancement as a new product \nand develop internal capacity by absorbing best practices through the partnership with ADB in the \npilot  phase,  (ii)  encourage  other  interested  PFIs  to  follow  the  IIFCL  example  once  commercial \nviability  has  been  established  and  offer  the  product,  and  (iii)  demonstrate  the  applicability  of  the \nproduct across subsectors. \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n \n13. \nThe  output  will  be  3\u25005  pilot  infrastructure  credit-enhanced  AA  rated  infrastructure  project \nbonds  (termed  as  projects  under  the  facility)  launched  by  IIFCL  and  other  PFIs.  The  facility  will \nseek  to  support  bonds  issued  from  a  cross  section  of  infrastructure  subsectors  and  by  different \nproject developers. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n14. \nStrategy  2020.  The facility  is  designed to  develop  the  local  currency  debt  market  to fund \ninfrastructure  and  is  aligned  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020.21  The  facility  supports  two  of  ADB\u2019s  five \ncore areas of operation under Strategy 2020\u2014infrastructure and financial sector development. The \n\n                                                \n19 Bond market development strategy rests on (i) regulatory and policy reforms, (ii) institution building, (iii) upgrading of \ntrading  and  settlement  systems,  (iv)  strengthening  of  disclosure  norms,  and  (v)  expanding  the  set  of  investable \ninstruments  and  investors.  The  facility  targets  the  final  aspect  and  is  being  undertaken  in  concert  with  other \ngovernment and RBI interventions to address  the remaining aspects. Specific initiatives include (i) allowing domestic \nfinancial  intermediaries  greater  leeway  to  invest  in  corporate  bonds,  (ii)  raising  the  limit  on  foreign  investment  in \ncorporate bonds, (iii) amending the bankruptcy code to protect rights of unsecured creditors, (iv) reducing transaction \ncosts in issuing and trading corporate bonds by reducing the need for repeated disclosures and  lowering high stamp \nduties,  and  (v)  reducing  the  preference  of  banks  for  loans  over  bonds  by  subjecting  both  assets  to  similar  mark-to-\nmarket requirements. \n\n 20 The  prepayment  of  bank  loans  with  bond  proceeds  will  free  up  capital  that  may  be  recycled  by  banks  to  lend  to \n\ngreenfield projects and help reduce the mismatch between the banks\u2019 long-term assets and short-term deposits. \n\n21 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6           \n\n \n\ninfrastructure  development  and \n\nfacility is consistent with a key Strategy 2020 goal of increasing cofinancing and optimizing use of \ncapital, by leveraging market resources.  \n \nCountry  partnership  strategy.  ADB's  India  country  partnership  strategy  for  2009\u20132012 \n15. \nemphasizes \nfour  pillars:  (i) inclusive  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  (ii)  catalyzing  investment,  (iii)  increasing  results  orientation \nand knowledge solutions, and (iv) regional cooperation. The facility supports the first three pillars, \ngiven  the  linkage  between  growth  and  infrastructure  development  and the objective of  catalyzing \ninfrastructure funds from a broad array of financial intermediaries. The country partnership strategy \nsupports  the  role  of  financial  intermediaries  in  providing  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure, \nemphasizing the PPP modality. 22 \n \nD. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nis  based  on \n\n16. \nThe  facility  design  has  recognized  lessons  learned  from  the  2008  global  financial  crisis. \nMonoline  insurers  in  the  United  States  and  Europe  experienced  problems  because  they  insured \ncomplex  securities  created  by  packaging  mortgages,  including  subprime  ones,  and  thereby \ndeparted  from  their  traditional  infrastructure  business,  which  had  steady  and  predictable  cash \nflows. While  these  activities  were  lucrative  in  the  short  run,  the  insurers  did  not  understand  how \nrisky the underlying assets really were. The PFIs under the facility will focus on their core business \nof providing PCGs to bonds issued by infrastructure SPVs and not diversify into unrelated areas. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n17. \nThe  facility  will  be  available  for  3  years  after  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approval  and  is \nexpected to support 3\u25005 projects. ADB\u2019s guarantee will not exceed 50% of the PFIs\u2019 exposure in \nthe  underlying  SPVs.  The  approval  of  eligible  PFI  and  projects,  as  well  as  extent  of  partnership \nwith  PFIs  and  exposure  to  projects  under  the  facility,  will  be  delegated  to  ADB\u2019s  investment \ncommittee on a case by case basis and will take into account overall objectives of the facility and \nprevailing market conditions. The PFI will (i) have a domestic AAA rating from all major domestic \nrating  agencies,  (ii)  obtain  necessary  clearances  from  the  government  and  regulators,  (iii)  be  in \ncompliance  with  applicable  ADB  and  national  safeguard  and  integrity  policies,  and  (iv)  have  an \nestablished  track  record  in  financing  infrastructure in  India.  The  projects  under  the  facility  will  be \nexpected to have (i) a minimum stand-alone bond rating without credit enhancement of BBB+, and \n(ii)  completed  at  least  2  years  of  commercial  operation.  ADB  and  the  PFI  will  jointly  undertake \nproject  selection,  guarantee  structuring,  investor  dialogue,  and  legal,  financial,  and  credit  due \ndiligence.23 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nThe facility  will  provide  for  ADB  to  issue  PCGs  in an  aggregate amount  of  up to  Rs7,168 \nmillion,  including  interest  in  favor  of  PFIs  providing  credit  enhancement  for  infrastructure  project \nbonds. When a PFI provides a PCG to the holder(s) of a project bond, ADB will in turn take up to \n50%  of  the  PFI\u2019s  credit  risk  by  issuing  it  a  counter  guarantee.  The  project  bonds  will  be \ndenominated in Indian rupees, as will be the underlying guarantees. \n \n\n                                                \n22 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n23 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f        7 \n\nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n19. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nADB\u2019s value addition consists of knowledge transfer and the assumption of a portion of the \nrisks in the issuing of infrastructure project bonds: \n\nThe  pilot  transactions  will  mark  a  first  in  India\u2019s  bond  market  and  demonstrate  a \nproduct  that  can  meet  a  key  development  priority  by  (a)  diversifying  infrastructure \nfinancing  sources,  (b)  bridging  the  gap  between  the  ratings  of  projects  in  need  of \nfinance  and  the  rating  requirements  of  long-term  financing  sources  such  as \ninsurance and pension funds, (c) reducing dependence on banks for infrastructure \nfinancing  and  supporting  development  of  the  local  debt  market,  and  (d)  replacing \nexisting floating rate bank financing with  long-term fixed-rate financing through the \nbond market and thereby reducing project risk. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  While  IIFCL  and  other  potential  PFIs  have  the  credit  ratings  needed  to  undertake \nPCG  transactions,  their  ability  to  launch  a  new  product  is  unproven.  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement  through  its  assumption  of  part  of  the  project  risk  through  the  joint \nexecution  of  the  pilot  transactions  will  be  critical  in  providing  credibility  to  the \ntransactions and building market confidence. \nPartnering with ADB will enhance the capacity of IIFCL and other PFIs in credit and \nlegal  due  diligence  and  guarantee  structuring.  ADB  inputs  on  due  diligence  and \npricing  will  be  needed  for  the  pilots  to  be  implemented  and  to  support  the \nmainstreaming  of  the  PCG  product  in  India.  This  approach  is  preferable  to  ADB \ndoing stand-alone, nonreplicable transactions. \nLessons from  the  PCG  pilots  may  be  considered  by  the  government  during  policy \nreviews  and  may  inform  parallel  initiatives  to  mainstream  the  credit  enhancement \nproduct. These lessons may provide guidance on (a) whether the IRDA\u2019s AA rating \nthreshold can be lowered to facilitate bond issues, (b) potential initiatives to reduce \ntransactions costs in issuing bonds, and (c) possible impediments to bond financing \nin concession agreements that need to be addressed. \n\n(iv) \n\n \nC. \n\nFirst Pilot Transaction \n\n20. \nA  first  pilot  project  under  the  facility  is  in  advanced  stage  of  preparation.  Under  this \ntransaction,  IIFCL  will  enhance  the  credit  rating  of  a  bond  to  be  issued  by  GMR  Jadcherla \nExpressways Private Limited (GJEPL), which was incorporated in October 2005 as a SPV owned \nby  GMR  Group  of  Companies  namely  GMR  Infrastructure,  GMR  Highways,  and  GMR  Energy.24 \nThe  SPV  was  awarded  a  20-year  concession  through  competitive  bidding  by  the  National \nHighways  Authority  of  India  in  February  2006  to  design,  engineer,  construct,  operate,  maintain, \nand expand into four lanes the existing two-lane section of National Highway 7 from Farukhnagar \nto  Jadcherla  and  to  improve,  operate,  and  maintain  the  four-lane  stretch  of  the  highway  from \nThondapalli  to  Farukhnagar  on  a  build-operate-transfer  basis.25  The  toll  expressway  began \noperations  in  February  2009.  The  project  cost  of  Rs5.2  billion  ($92.2  million)  was  financed  by  a \nSCB  loan  of  Rs3.5  billion  ($62  million),  equity  of  Rs1.2  billion  ($21.2  million),  and  mezzanine \n\n                                                \n24 GMR Group was founded over 30 years ago with interests in energy, airports, roads, and urban infrastructure. GMR \nGroup is listed both on the Mumbai and National stock exchanges.  As of 31 March 2011, the group had a portfolio of \n16 power, 4 airport, and 9 road projects (annuity projects totaling 1,198 lane km and toll projects totaling 2,150 lane \nkm).  In  FY2011,  GMR  Group  had  consolidated  net  revenues  of  Rs60.85  billion  ($1.1  billion)  and  earnings  before \ninterest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of Rs18.68 billion ($331.3 million). \n\n 25 Although  this  project  involves  a  toll  highway,  subsequent  projects  may  also  include  annuity  projects.  Annuity \nconcessions are a variant of the build-operate-transfer model in which the private operator is remunerated via a fixed, \nperiodic  payment  (annuity)  from  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  rather  than  through  tolls.  Under  these \ncontracts, the private operator is responsible for construction, operation, and maintenance for a fixed period. \n\n \n\n\f8           \n\n \n\ncapital of Rs0.5 billion ($8.8 million). GJEPL will prepay the entire existing loan through a proposed \n12.5-year bond issue. \n \n21. \nGuarantee  structure.  IIFCL  will  guarantee  the  payment  of  the  outstanding  principal  and \ninterest  of  the  bond  in  Indian  rupees  which  translates  up  to  28%  of  the  outstanding  principal.26 \nIIFCL\u2019s  partial  guarantee  will  raise  the  proposed  bond\u2019s  stand-alone  domestic  credit  rating  of  A \nwithout credit enhancement to AA. In its turn, ADB will issue a guarantee to IIFCL for 50% (ADB\u2019s \nportion) of IIFCL\u2019s exposure under its own guarantee, thereby sharing the risk with respect to the \nunderlying project.27 IIFCL\u2019s PCG (and therefore also ADB\u2019s) will be a first-loss guarantee (footnote \n17).  After  IIFCL  has  paid  its  obligations  under  the  guarantee,  it  will  have  recourse  to  the  project \nassets,  subject  to  applicable  waterfall  provisions,  and  must  share  any  recoveries  with  ADB \n(proportionate to the actual payments made by each under their respective PCGs). As PCGs are \nnew to IIFCL, its capacity will be augmented by ADB support. Concurrently, IIFCL will continue its \ncapacity  building  activities  in  credit  appraisal,  human  resources  and  skills,  organizational \nrestructuring, and system and software upgrades. Under the first transaction, ADB will share 50% \nof  the  underlying  project  risk  for  the  first  5  years  only  and  IIFCL  will  take  full  exposure  for  the \nresidual bond period. Any extension will require ADB approval. \n \n22. \nProject  financials  and  risk  assessment.  The  project  tollway  links  Hyderabad  and \nBangalore, both state capitals and major cities, with several industries located along its route. The \nfinancing  agreements  for  the  project  were  signed  on  18  August  2006  and  commercial  operation \nbegan  on  12  February  2009.  A  conservative  sensitizing  of  the  financial  model  provided  by  the \nsponsor indicated that the project is expected to have robust cash flows and adequate debt service \ncoverage ratio. Under base case scenarios, GJEPL is financially viable and the expected financial \ninternal rate of return at 14%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 10.8%.28 \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigations \n\n23. \nCredit  enhancement  is  new  to  India  and  its  success  and  viability  depends  on  several \nfactors,  including  supply  and  demand  of  the  product  which  cannot  be  currently  determined. \nHowever,  ADB\u2019s  credit  risk  depends  on  its  exposure  to  individual  projects  under  the  facility.  The \nkey general risks are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProduct  sustainability.  A  risk  of  poor  product  sustainability  will  arise  if  the \neconomics of the transaction are not viable for the issuer, bondholders, or the credit \nenhancers. The sustainability of the program will be at risk if PFIs and ADB cannot \nachieve  adequate  pricing  for  the  credit  enhancements  provided.  Other  risk  factors \ninclude  high  long-term  bond  interest  rates,  availability  of  low  cost  bank  financing \nand inability of the PFI to carry out transactions on their own once pilot transactions \nare completed and ADB withdraws. This risk will be mitigated to some extent by the \npricing of the transaction, which will take market benchmarks and risk-based pricing \ninto account, by selecting PFIs that have experience in infrastructure financing, and \nby  improving  the  technical  capacity  of  these  PFIs  when  necessary.  Nonetheless, \nthis is a new product and its long-term viability has not been tested in India. \nCounterparty  risk  to  participating  financial  institution.  ADB  does  not  take  any \ncredit  risk  on  the  PFI  and  is  ultimately  exposed  to  underlying  project  risk.  There \ncould be some settlement risk with the PFI, but this is expected to be minimal given \n\n                                                \n26 ICRA  Ratings  Limited  provided  a  guidance  of  24%  as  the  extent  of  coverage  required  to  enhance  the  rating  of  the \nstand-alone  A  rating  to  AA.  A  number  of  28%  has  been  indicated  as  the  outside  range  of  the  extent  of  coverage \nneeded. An overview of the structure and mechanics of guarantee cover is provided in Guarantee Structure and Sizing \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n27 ADB\u2019s maximum aggregate liability under its guarantee for the first pilot transaction will be up to Rs448 million. \n28 Financial Analysis, and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f        9 \n\nthe  AAA  domestic  credit  rating  of  the PFI. Notwithstanding,  it is crucial for PFIs to \nhave a minimum level of technical skills to identify projects in line with the selection \ncriteria. In addition, the PFI could select weak projects and incorrectly price risk but \nthis  will  be  mitigated  because  ADB  will  select  projects,  price  risk,  and  undertake \nproject level due diligence along with the PFI. With respect to the first PFI, there are \nsome  issues  on  the  choice  of  IIFCL  due  to  concerns  in  its  ability  to  undertake \nindependent  project  assessment.  However,  this  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  ongoing \ncapacity building technical assistance provided by the World Bank and government \nsupport to IIFCL to promote credit enhancement products for infrastructure. \nProject  risk.  The  following  are  expected  to  be  key  risks  of  the  underlying  eligible \nprojects:  demand  risk,  off-take  risk,  operation  and  maintenance  risk,  sponsor  risk, \ntariff risk, and concessionaire risk. These risks will be partially mitigated by choosing \ntransactions  with  a  minimum  BBB+  credit  rating  from  local  rating  agencies,  good \nsponsors, and projects that have been completed 2 years of operations. However, \nrisks  may  vary  by  individual  project  and  will  need  to  be  examined  in  detail  and \naddressed on a case-to-case basis. For the first SPV GJEPL, the project is primarily \nexposed  to  risks  related  to  traffic  volatility  in  its  concession  area  and  tariff \nescalation,  which  is  compensated  by  the  lack  of  completion  risk  and  minimal \noperation and maintenance risk due to the straightforward operations of the toll road. \nRegulatory  risk.  ADB  has  carried  out  due  diligence  to  assess  the  legal  and \nregulatory risks to the first pilot transaction. The enabling legislative and regulatory \nbasis  for  ADB  and  PFIs  to  enter  transactions  has  been  examined,  as  have  the \napprovals  needed  from  the  government  and  RBI.  This  project,  like  all  others,  is \nexposed  to  regulatory  risks  but  is  strongly  supported  by  the  government  given  its \nalignment with initiatives to develop India\u2019s bond market. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThe  facility  is  classified  as  category  FI  with  respect  to  ADB\u2019s  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 policies, and will comply with the applicable requirements of \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A  compliance  audit  of  the  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards  performance  of  the  national  highway  operated  and  maintained  by  GJEPL  was \nconducted  by  IIFCL and  provided  to  ADB  for  clearance. The  audit  revealed  that  the  project  is  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s  and national safeguard policies as provided in IIFCL\u2019s environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  framework  (ESSF)  requirements.29 With  respect  to the  GJEPL transaction,  the \naudit requirement and monitoring and due diligence by IIFCL is integrated into IIFCL\u2019s ESSF. The \naudit  revealed  that  GJEPL  needed  to  adopt  an  emergency  preparedness  and  response  plan, \nwhich  was  then  developed.  The  audit  report,  the  operational  phase  environment  management \nplan,  including  the  emergency  preparedness  and  response  plan  and  other  measures  to  be \nimplemented by GJEPL and monitored by ADB and IIFCL, are available on ADB\u2019s website.30  \n \n25. \nFinally,  GJEPL  or  any  other  client  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  and \nreport  on  the  compliance  (including  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws  and/or  adherence  to \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with \n\n                                                \n29 IIFCL\u2019s  ESSF  can  be  accessed  from  http://www.iifcl.org/Content/ESMU.aspx  and  the  Environmental  and  Social \n\nSafeguards Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n30 IIFCL  has  sufficient  capacity  to  ensure  project  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  ESSF.  It  established  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  unit  in  February  2010  and  has  five  staff  positions  for  a  head  of  unit,  two \nenvironment  specialists,  and  two  social  safeguard  specialists.  A  review  of  IIFCL\u2019s  ESSF,  including  a  2010  audit  of \nADB-supported IIFCL projects, revealed overall compliance with the ESSF requirements.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10           \n\n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\naffected people are conducted in accordance with ADB requirements and the ESSF of the PFI will \nmonitor compliance with core labor standards and applicable national labor laws and regulations.  \n \n26. \nADB  will  require  other  PFIs  it  considers  partnering  with  under  the  facility  to  establish  an \nESSF  consistent  with  IIFCL\u2019s  ESSF  and  ADB  safeguard  requirements  before  finalizing  a  risk \nparticipation  arrangement.  Given  that  projects  eligible  under  this  facility  should  have  been  in \ncommercial operation for at least 2 years, an environmental and social compliance audit, including \nan on-site assessment, will be conducted by the project sponsor31 to determine whether relevant \nactions  were  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  prescribed  by  ADB\u2019s  and  national  safeguard \npolicies.32  In  case  of  outstanding  compliance  issues,  a  corrective  action  plan  agreed  to  by  ADB \nand the PFI and the project sponsor will be prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nIIFCL, the issuer, and GMR Group were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date)  and its policy of implementing best international practice relating to combating \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment \ndocumentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the \nfinancing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of  noncompliance.  Future  eligible \nfinancial institutions, issuers, and their sponsors will be advised of the same.  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nfor nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the  Charter),33 \n29. \nthe  Government  of  India  has  confirmed  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to \nIIFCL, and will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to other \nPFIs when this becomes relevant.
