The project will \nadopt an integrated approach to enhance rural and urban water links that addresses a complex \nenvironmental problem in rapidly developing societies therefore serves as a demonstration model \nfor the PRC and beyond. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  is  one  of  the  three  key  economic  growth \nengines in the PRC. Its nine provinces and two specially administered municipalities account for \nmore  than  40%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  population,  40%  of  its  freshwater  resources,  and  about  45%  of \neconomic output. While the YREB has benefited from extensive development since the 1980s, \neconomic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin lags that of the \ncoastal  areas.  These parts  of the  YREB  still face significant  challenges as a  result  of  (i)  weak \ninstitutional coordination for strategic planning; (ii) increasing pollution and pressure on natural \nresources; (iii) slow transformation to green development; and (iv) limited integration of waterways, \nports,  and  intermodal  logistics.  To  manage  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC \nformulated  the  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132030. 1  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach to \nstrategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB.2 Priority is \ngiven to (i) institutional strengthening and policy reform; (ii) ecosystem restoration, environmental \nprotection,  and  management  of  water  resources;  (iii)  inclusive  green  industrial  transformation; \nand (iv) construction of an integrated multimodal transport corridor. \n \n4. \nRural livelihoods in the YREB have lagged industrial production and urban livelihoods. As \na result, income inequality and poverty persist in rural areas of the less-developed middle and \nupper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. Most rural wastewater and solid waste is discharged \ndirectly  to  the  water  system  without  treatment  and  proper  disposal. 3  As  the  rural  economy \nexpands, increasing regulatory, administrative, and environmental management challenges will \nrequire stronger institutional capacity. Against this background, the  government formulated the \nNational  Strategic  Plan  for  Rural  Vitalization,  2018\u20132022  to  promote  poverty  reduction,  rural \ndevelopment,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth. 4  The  rural  vitalization  strategy  focuses  on \ngovernance  reform,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  rural\u2013urban  integration, \n\n \n\n1  Government of the PRC. 2016.

Manila. \n\n3  In  2017,  only  25%  of  villages  had  appropriate  sanitation  facilities  and  only  60%  had  solid  waste  collection  and \ndisposal services, contributing to poor environmental conditions. In 2015, the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 \nmandated  the  installation  of  sanitation  systems  in  at  least  70%  of  the  rural  villages  in  the  country  by  2020 \n(Government  of  the  PRC.  2016.

National Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022. Beijing. \n \n\n\fecosystem protection, and rural development. The strategy prioritizes managing climate change \nand the environment to support ecological  civilization and rural vitalization. \n \n5. \nProject area. Dengzhou, a county-level city in Nanyang City, Henan Province, is poor and \nrelatively rural. It has weak institutional capacity in environmental management and is strategically \nlocated  at  the  sources  of  South\u2013North  Water  Diversion  Project. 5  As  part  of  the  Han  River \nwatershed in the Yangtze River Basin, Dengzhou City is a national key ecological function zone, \nas designated by the government. With 28 townships and 606 villages, the city has an area of \n2,369 square kilometers and had a population of 1.78 million people in 2018, of which 60% are \nrural. The project area covers the townships and villages along the Tuan River, a tributary of the \nHan River in Dengzhou City. In 2018, most of the city\u2019s 32,465 poor people (with an annual per \ncapita income of less than CNY3,208) were low-paid women. The Tuan River Basin has (i) a per \ncapita freshwater availability of only 345 cubic meters (m3) per year (less than 13% of the national \naverage), (ii) the lowest water supply coverage that relies on polluted groundwater, and (iii) the \nhighest disposal rate of untreated wastewater and solid wastes. Located in Henan Province, an \necological red-line area, Dengzhou City is part of a cluster of cities and counties surrounding the \nYREB that significantly contribute to the YREB\u2019s development goals.6 \n \n6. \nPoor  water  quality.  Almost  100%  of  Dengzhou  City\u2019s  rural  population  and  30%  of  its \nurban  population  lacks  proper  access  to  water,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management \nfacilities. This results in poor health and creates heavy burden particularly for women, who play a \nmajor role in household water and waste management in the city. Despite experiencing an acute \nwater scarcity, the city, as a source of water diversion project, helps resolve the water scarcity \nproblems  in  the  water-deprived  northern  region  of  the  PRC.  About  143,000  of  the  city\u2019s  rural \npopulation relies for their drinking water supply on shallow groundwater that is contaminated by \nthe heavily polluted Tuan River, untreated wastes, and chemical fertilizers used extensively on \nfarmland.  The  city\u2019s  groundwater  quality  is  far  below  national  standards.7 From  2008  to  2018, \nthere  were  300,000  cases of  waterborne  diseases,  affecting  mainly  women  and  children.8 The \nTuan  River  is  heavily  polluted  from  point  sources,  including  6  million  m3  of  wastewater,  and \n300,000 tons of garbage directly disposed into the river annually; and nonpoint sources, mainly \nfrom farmlands; and water quality exceeds class V (the worst on the scale) in almost every section \nof the lower Tuan River.9 \n \n7. \nImpaired water ecosystem services. The untreated wastewater and accumulated solid \nwaste in the Tuan River have severely impacted the aquatic life and impaired the entire water \necosystem.  The  river\u2019s  hydrology,  water  environment,  and  geomorphology  have  also  been \nsubstantially altered by water operation, urbanization, and climate change impacts, resulting in a \ndegraded river corridor environment. Serious riverbank erosion has progressively damaged the \nproductive farmlands. The undercutting of the riverbank and accumulation of construction wastes \nin various sections of the river have also exacerbated the degradation of the water environment \nand damaged the riverfront design in the urban area. Further, several of the city\u2019s natural wetlands \nand  drainage  channels,  including  small  creeks  of  hydrological,  environmental,  and  historical \nsignificance,  have  disappeared  since  2010.  The  frequency  of  floods  is  on  the  rise  because  of \nmorphological changes, urbanization on the floodplain, and climatic variability, therefore likely to \n\n \n\n5  South\u2013North Water Diversion Project. http://www.china.org.cn/waterdiversion/index.htm. \n6   In  2015,  PRC  formulated  a  national  policy,  mandating  local  governments  to  establish  ecosystems  services \n\nassessments in land use planning, which is known as ecological redline policy. \n\n7  Government of the PRC. 2007. National Drinking Water Quality Standard (GB 5749-2006). Beijing. \n8  Dengzhou City Government. 2018. Statistical Yearbook. Dengzhou City. \n9  Above class III water is unfit for drinking according to the PRC\u2019s Environmental Water Quality Standard (GB 3838-2002). \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fpose a serious problem for the city. The 30-kilometer (km) river profile in the city is fully eutrophic, \nand the resulting persistent foul odor has impaired the living environment along the river reach.10 \n \n8. \nWeak institution and capacity to manage water resources. Since beginning operations \nin late 2014, the water diversion project has allocated 692 million m3 of free of charge water to \nDengzhou City each year, of which only about 15% has been used because of a lack of proper \nplanning and limited water resource management capacity. The DCG adopted various measures \nto protect the river environment and improve the livelihood of the people, but it could not deliver \nthe expected results because of inadequate problem analysis, fragmented management of water \nand ecosystem services, and poor planning and design without proper stakeholder participation. \nLack of asset management in the DCG has substantially increased the risk of poor public services \nand  unforeseen  costs  in  development  investments.  Located  at  the  headstream  of  the  water \ndiversion  project,  the  city  faces  restrictions  on  development  mainly  because  water  quality  and \nquantity  in  the  Danjiangkou  Reservoir  is  being  degraded. 11 To  ensure  sound  environmental \nmanagement and protection of the reservoir, the DCG receives eco-compensation annually from \nthe Beijing Municipal Government as an incentive, but this has not been used properly.12  \n\n9. \nGiven the competing needs for soil and water conservation and rural livelihood development \nin this unique ecosystem, an integrated watershed management is required with strong database. \nTo  establish  a  fair  compensation  mechanism,  a  performance-based  approach  with  proper \nmonitoring and evaluation of outcomes and financial rewards or penalty provisions also needs to \nbe developed with the involvement of the DCG and the cities that benefit from the water diversion \nproject. To do this, the DCG needs to strengthen its institutional and operational capacities. \n \nRural\u2013urban  water  links.  Complex  and  poorly  managed  rural\u2013urban  water  links  have \n10. \ndirect implications on rural and urban livelihoods, and the Tuan River environment. For example, \nuntreated sewage from the urban area on the right bank of the river is discharged directly into the \nTuan River, where it recharges the groundwater that is the only source of drinking water in the \nrural  area  on  the  left  bank.  Similarly,  poor  sanitation  and  solid waste  management  in  the rural \nvillages,  and  the  use  of  chemical  fertilizer  and  pesticides  on  the  farmlands,  contaminate  the \ngroundwater and damage the river environment and the river front design of the urban area. Urban \nencroachment  into  the  river  corridor  and  disposal  of  construction  wastes  into  the  river  have \nresulted in river sedimentation leading to the water contamination and frequent flooding in rural \nvillages 30 km downstream.  \n\n11. \nThe  DCG  urgently  needs  to  address  these  links  by  improving  its  water  management \nstrategy and plan and strengthening its institutional and technical capacities to achieve the goals. \nLocated in a less-developed region in the middle of Yangtze River Basin, the city can demonstrate \nan environmentally sustainable growth model for addressing the rural\u2013urban water links that can \nbe replicated in other parts of the river basin and the PRC. \n\n \n\n10 Eutrophication is the process by which excessive nutrients accumulate in a water body causing dense plant growth \n\nand animal death from lack of dissolved oxygen. \n\n11 The reservoir of the water diversion project, constructed in the 1950s, has a surface area of 1,050 square kilometers; \nstorage capacity of 29.05 cubic kilometers; and a watershed area of 95,200 square kilometers. Besides irrigation, \nflood control, and hydropower generation, it also supplies water through a 1,274 km stretch of canal to 14 cities in \nthe northern PRC, benefiting more than 50 million people in the water-deprived cities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the \nprovinces of Hebei and Henan under the water diversion project. \n\n12 The eco-compensation includes CNY278 million in direct cash payments, CNY340 million for capacity building  in \nenvironmental protection, medical coverage and education for affected populations, and free use of 692 million m3 \nof water from the water diversion project for various uses. The amount is part of the city government\u2019s annual budget \nand there is no proper accounting provision for the compensation fund by source and area. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fStrategic  fit.  Under  the  rural  vitalization  plan  (footnote  4),  local  governments  will \n12. \nimplement their own plans to improve rural public services and the environment. The DCG has \nformulated its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, consistent with the national Thirteenth Five-\nYear Plan, 2016\u20132020.13 In addition to local development plans, the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030,  especially  the  operational  priority  areas  of  tackling  climate  change,  building \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; promoting rural development and \nfood  security;  and  making  cities  more  livable.14 It  is  also  closely  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, particularly the three major principles of managing \nclimate change and environment, supporting inclusive economic growth, and fostering knowledge \ncooperation.15 It is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which emphasizes \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) with a focus on rural water management;16 and \nSustainable Development Goals 6, 11, and 13.17 The project also supports ADB\u2019s new action plan \nfor healthy oceans by reducing the amount of solid waste discharged into the Yangtze River and \neventually the sea.18 The project will contribute to the fulfillment of the Paris Agreement that the \nPRC signed in 2015, and is aligned with the PRC\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions \nto limit carbon emissions by 2030.19 \n \n13. \nLessons learned. The project will implement IWRM focusing on rural\u2013urban integration \nto improve rural livelihoods and the Tuan River environment in Dengzhou City. The project design \nhas  incorporated  lessons  from  previous  ADB-financed  projects  and  policy-oriented  studies  on \nIWRM, environmental and ecosystem improvement, wetland and lake management, and rural\u2013\nurban  integration  in  the  PRC  and  other  developing  member  countries.  Past  and  ongoing  ADB \nsupport in the PRC underscore the importance of (i) strengthening nature-based solutions and \ncommunity  engagement;  (ii)  ensuring  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  provisions  include \nsustainable sources of finance; (iii) using high-level technologies in IWRM, including in decision-\nmaking;  (iv)  introducing  institutional  and  financial  management  reforms  that  contribute  to \nsustainable water resources management; (v) developing capacity for project implementation and \nO&M; and (vi) instituting an effective project monitoring and evaluation system.20 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: quality of life along YREB improved.21 The \n14. \nproject  will  have  the  following  outcome:  water  security  and  environmental  sustainability  in \nDengzhou City improved.22 \n \n\n2016\u20132020.

Licensed \ndomestic  design  institutes  prepared  all  project  components,  considering  local  geophysical, \nsocioeconomic, and hydrometeorological conditions, as well as anticipated climate change risks \n(rated  medium),  in  accordance  with  PRC  design  guidelines  and  local  regulations.  The  project \nconsidered technical alternatives, such as (i) a centralized or decentralized water supply system, \n(ii) a general inspection or automatic acoustic system to detect water leakage in the water supply \ndistribution network, (iii) centralized or distributed wastewater treatment plants, (iv) mechanical or \necological river dredging, (v) concrete lining or gabion wall for erosion control, and (vi) continuous \nor  discontinuous  dike  for  flood  control,  and  their  technical  and  economic  viability.  It  also  (i) \ndeliberated ways to promote rural\u2013urban water links to improve the water quality and hydrological \ncycle,  (ii)  carried  out  a  demand  projection  to  determine  the  size  and  scale  of  each  project \ncomponent, (iii) promoted the use of information and communication technology in IWRM, and \n(iv) optimized the timescales for project implementation. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nThe economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.2%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of  CNY1,008.0 \nmillion. The analysis also confirmed the economic viability of all subprojects.26 Sensitivity analysis \nindicated that the project is robust to the negative scenarios examined, such as an increase in \ninvestment  costs,  a  reduction  in  benefits,  and  an  increase  in  O&M  costs.  The  full  economic \nbenefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher, as some effects, such as ecological \nbenefits, are not easily quantifiable.  \n\n26. \nThe  financial  analysis  included  financial  viability  assessments  for  revenue-generating \ncomponents, an assessment of the project\u2019s financial sustainability, and an assessment of the \nfinancial  capacity  of  the  DCG.  For  revenue-generating  components,  project  revenues  are \nsufficient  to  cover  all  recurrent  costs.  Financial  sustainability  considered  the  fiscal  impact  of \ncounterpart funding for the project; incremental recurrent costs, including O&M expenditures; and \ndebt  service  for  the  project.  The  DCG  derives  on  average  70%  of  funding  from  the  provincial \ngovernment. While the  analysis  confirmed the financial  sustainability  of  the project, the  DCG\u2019s \nreliance  on  provincial  government  budgetary  allocations  poses  a  substantial  risk  to  financial \nsustainability  because  of  possible  changes  in  budgetary  allocations  by  the  upper  government. \nThe  project  includes  adequate  mitigation  measures,  including  assurances  for  continued  O&M \nsupport and for increases in water and wastewater tariffs for full O&M cost recovery, as well as \noperational efficiency enhancements through improvements to asset management systems. \n \nC. \n \nThe assessed financial management risk is moderate mainly because of the DCG\u2019s lack \n27. \nof familiarity with ADB\u2019s financial management policies and procedures. The executing agency\u2019s \nfinancial  staff  capacity,  accounting,  reporting  systems,  and  internal  and  external  audit \narrangements  are  adequate.  Further,  the  DCG\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  under  the \n\nGovernance \n\n26 The subprojects\u2019 economic internal rates of return range from 9.1% to 15.6%. \n \n\n \n\n\fguidance of the Henan Provincial Government, which is familiar with development partner funded \nproject management,  will  be  adequate  for  effective financial  management  of  the  project.27 The \nassessment recommended a time-bound action plan, which the DCG will implement during the \nproject period, to mitigate the identified financial management risks.  \n\n28. \nThe  procurement  risk  assessment  confirmed  that  the  DCG,  supported  by  the  project \nmanagement office, has adequate capacity to implement the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time),  despite  its  lack  of  experience  with  internationally  financed  projects.  All \nprocurement  will  be  organized  through  an  experienced  procurement  agent  and  the  project \nmanagement  and  capacity  development  consultants  will  provide  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement support to project management office throughout the project implementation.  \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Dengzhou  City  Government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe project is classified general intervention for poverty reduction. The project preparation \nteam in close coordination with DCG undertook the poverty and social analysis based on intensive \nstakeholder  consultations  and  socioeconomic  surveys.  It  indicated  that  a  total  of  746,000 \nresidents in 11 project towns, including 13,137 poor people, will directly benefit from the project \nthrough reduced water pollution, improved drinking water supply system, and better environment \nand ecological protection in the Tuan River watershed. Other residents in Dengzhou City will also \nbenefit  indirectly  from  improved  environment  and  ecology.  The  project  will  create  3,000  jobs \nduring  project  implementation  and  150  jobs  during  operation.  The  DCG  prepared  a  social \ndevelopment action plan based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific targets for the \npoor  and  low-income  people.  The  DCG  consulted  with  local  residents  and  other  stakeholders \nduring  the  project  preparation.  The  PAM  includes  a  consultation  and  participation  plan  for  the \nproject implementation stage (footnote 25). \n \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \n31. \nGender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects.28 The  project  will  ensure  that  women  will \nparticipate  in  and  benefit  equitably  from  the  project.  Women  are  expected  to  benefit  from \nincreased employment, piped water supply in rural areas, improved living environment, and better \nquality of life. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared based on gender analyses to ensure \ngender  equality.  The  GAP  includes  the  following  key  measures  and  targets  for  women:  (i) \nequitable  participation  of  women  in  decision-making,  with  women  making  up  at  least  40%  of \nparticipants; (ii) capacity building of staff of the DCG to implement the GAP and related measures; \n(iii) priority employment opportunities for women, with women making up at least 30% employees \nduring construction and at least 40% during operation; (iv) participation of women in awareness-\nraising  activities  and  public  hearings,  with  participants  comprising  at  least  40%  women;  (v) \nparticipation of women in decision-making for the pilot community-based solid waste management \nprogram, with at least 40% female membership of community groups; and (vi) ensuring women \nemployees\u2019 equitable access to sanitation and health education (such as HIV/AIDS awareness) \nduring construction. Gender targets are included in the design and monitoring framework. \n\n \n\n27 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) was conducted in \n\nJanuary 2019. \n\n28 ADB. 2012.

The project preparation team in close coordination with DCG \nundertook  an  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP)  and  grievance  redress  mechanism,  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \ndisclosed it on ADB\u2019s website. The initial environmental examination is based on the approved \ndomestic  feasibility  studies,  environmental  assessment  reports,  site  visits,  and  stakeholder \nconsultations. The outcomes of the stakeholder consultations have been integrated in the project \ndesign, including works for heritage preservation. The project team conducted due diligence for \nan associated facility, a small shallow reservoir, for which operational and safety plans have been \nprepared consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for dams. The DCG, \nthrough the project management office, will be responsible for implementation and compliance \nwith the EMP, including for mitigation measures, monitoring, and reporting. Loan implementation \nconsultants and a capacity-building program are included in the project design. \n \n34. \nThe project will contribute to municipal targets for environmental improvement, including \nimproved flood control, reduced siltation, and improved solid waste management. Construction \nrisks  include  the  potential  release  of  contaminants  from  polluted  sediments  during  dredging  or \ndisposal, and short-term impacts such as dust and noise. Operational risks include altered river \nhydrology, river pollution from treated wastewater, and inadequate O&M of the project facilities. \nMitigation  measures  are  described  in  the  EMP.  The  project  will  contribute  to  climate  change \nadaptation and mitigation by (i) increasing the resilience of the flood defense and environmental \nprotection infrastructure in accordance with anticipated climate impacts through careful selection \nof materials and locations, and (ii) sequestering carbon through the revegetation components. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  will  permanently  occupy  479.43 \n35. \nhectares (ha) of land, of which 346.03 ha is existing state-owned land and 133.4 ha is collective \nland that will be acquired. A total of 793 households with 3,023 persons will be affected by the \nproject\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement impacts; 525 households with 1,841 persons will be \nphysically relocated; and 196.87 ha of land will be used temporarily during construction. The DCG \nhas  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC.  The  plan  includes  adequate  measures  for \ncompensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of affected people. The plan is based on surveys \nand  consultations  with  affected  people  during  project  preparation  and  will  be  further  updated \nthrough additional surveys and consultations during project implementation. A grievance redress \nmechanism has been established and incorporated into the resettlement plan. The DCG has the \ncapacity to implement domestically funded projects, and its capacity will be strengthened by the \nproject consultants to implement the resettlement plan in compliance with ADB requirements. An \nexternal  monitoring  agency  will  be  engaged  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement \nplan and will submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Eight villages in the project area include members of \n36. \nthe Hui ethnic minority group. While the ethnic minorities are integrated into mainstream society \nin terms of socioeconomic and livelihood systems, they have distinct religious and cultural beliefs \nand  practices.  Therefore,  indigenous  peoples\u2019  safeguards  are  triggered;  and  the  DCG  has \nprepared an ethnic minority development plan to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit equitably \n\n29 ADB.
