THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Baucau to Viqueque Highway Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) for Promoting Sustainable \nLand Transport Infrastructure, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will (i) upgrade 58 kilometers (km) of national roads from Baucau to Viqueque, \nwith considerations for better resilience to climate change and social inclusive design; and (ii) \nprovide institutional strengthening and capacity building. The project supports continuing efforts \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners to upgrade and sustain \nthe country\u2019s national road network. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Timor-Leste has the third largest economy among ADB\u2019s 14 Pacific developing member \ncountries, with gross domestic product\u2014excluding offshore petroleum operations\u2014at about $1.5 \nbillion as of 2016. Largely because of its petroleum wealth, the country has attained lower middle-\nincome  and  medium  human  development  status.  However,  about  70%  of  the  1.2  million \npopulation still live in rural areas and rely on subsistence agriculture. There is a high maternal \nmortality rate (557 per 100,000 live births) and a high infant mortality rate (64 per 1,000 live births) \ndue to poverty and poor access to primary health care.1 Formal employment opportunities are \nmostly found in the public sector, with very little manufacturing and production for export in the \nprivate sector. \n \n4.  ADB has a strong track record in the sector. A 25-year period of conflict from 1975 to \n1999 suppressed any significant investment in maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network \nin Timor-Leste prior to independence in 2002. Progressive deterioration leading to poor road \nconditions continued over most of the first decade of independence. To help address road \nconnectivity and safety in Timor-Leste, ADB has financed a series of transport sector projects, \nincluding the Road Network Development Sector Project, the Road Network Upgrading Project, \nand the Road Network Upgrading Sector Project.2 ADB is also cofinancing with the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) the upgrading of the Dili\u2013Baucau road.3 In combination \nwith other development partner-supported projects, about 560 km or 39% of the most important \nsections of the national road network are expected to be upgraded by the end of 2019.4 The \n                                                \n1  Sustainable Development Goal 3 targets a maternal mortality rate of less than 70 per 100,000 live births, and an \ninfant mortality rate of 12 per 1,000 live births. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n3  ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Dili to Baucau Highway Project. Manila. \n4  For example, ADB is cofinancing the upgrading of the Dili\u2013Baucau road together with JICA, while the World Bank is \nfinancing the upgrading of the Dili\u2013Ainaro road. \n ", "2 \nproject targets a crucial north\u2013south component of the land transport network, extending ADB\u2019s \ncoverage of national road network upgrading from past and ongoing road projects. \n \n5.  The key priority under the government\u2019s Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for 2011\u2013\n2030 aims to rehabilitate and upgrade all existing roads and bridges by 2020, establish a ring \nnational highway, and deliver a comprehensive road maintenance program by 2030. 5 ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Timor-Leste, 2016\u20132020 emphasizes the need for additional \ninfrastructure  investment  to  support  inclusive  growth  and  the  development  of  systems  for \noperation and maintenance to help sustain recent progress.6  \n \n6.  The Baucau to Viqueque Highway is an important national corridor. It links Viqueque \nDistrict and the south coast of Laut\u00e9m to Baucau District, and to the capital city of Dili. The existing \nroad is generally 4.5 meters (m) wide, mostly unsealed, and in poor condition; it takes up to 10 \nhours to commute between Dili and Viqueque by bus. Substantial reductions in travel time and \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs) are expected from upgrading the road, leading to improved road \nsafety and better access to markets, health clinics, schools, and other community services. The \ngovernment is planning the development of a downstream petrochemical industrial hub on the \nsouth coast through its Tasi Mane project. The project will support not only this government \ninitiative but also the broader economic development of agriculture-rich and high tourism potential \ndistricts on Timor-Leste\u2019s southern coast. \n \n7.  Support to transport agencies is crucial for long term sustainability. Under the \nMinistry of Public Works, Transport and Communications (MPWTC), the Directorate of Roads, \nBridges  and  Flood  Control  (DRBFC)  is  responsible  for  national  road and  bridge  planning, \nmaintenance, construction and improvements, and flood protection. As increasing lengths of new \nand rehabilitated roads are being developed, the DRBFC recently established a maintenance unit \nin 2015 that is being supported by an ongoing 3-year capacity development program for road \nmaintenance by JICA. JICA is also providing support in establishing a road maintenance fund. \nThe government, development partners, and other stakeholders agree that the most critical \nobstacle to sustaining capital investments made so far in the roads subsector from premature \ndeterioration is the absence of a comprehensive national road maintenance strategy and plan \n(NRMSP). The project, through the attached transaction TA, will support the development of a \nNRMSP to improve road maintenance planning and asset management. \n \n8.  The  DRBFC  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  major  road  improvement  and \nrehabilitation projects. Due to previous weak implementation capacity, an ADB-financed TA is \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  a  capacity  development  framework  and  strategy  for  the \nMPWTC.7 The project management unit (PMU) under the DRBFC is responsible for managing \nADB, JICA, and World Bank projects, and has successfully coordinated these development \npartners and ensured that consistent technical standards and safeguards have been applied. \n \n9.  The  MPWTC,  through  the  National  Directorate  of  Land  Transport  (DNTT),  is  also \nresponsible  for  regulating  land  and  public  transport,  issuing  driver\u2019s  licenses  and  vehicle \nregistrations, overseeing traffic management, and controlling vehicle overloading. In 2016, the \nMinistry of Interior established the National Directorate of Road Safety responsible for planning, \ncoordinating, and implementing national road safety policy, and applying road safety laws. The \nDepartment of Traffic and Road Safety under the Timor-Leste National Police enforces road \n                                                \n5  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

The project, through the attached transaction TA, will support \ntransitioning the DNTT and National Directorate of Road Safety to an autonomous national land \ntransport authority, which would consolidate national responsibility, improve the standard of land \ntransport regulation and management, and help increase nontax revenue that could support road \nmaintenance. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. There are various initiatives by development partners \nto address road maintenance. However, these efforts have largely been fragmented and driven \nprimarily by development partners\u2019 individual TA and capacity support programs. The project will \nprepare a comprehensive strategy and plan for road maintenance and strengthen the existing \nDRBFC maintenance unit, complementing JICA\u2019s capacity efforts and road fund establishment. \nIt is envisaged that this strategy and plan will formulate a long-term programmatic approach for \nroutine and periodic maintenance as well as emergency work for the national road network. The \nstrategy and plan also aim to consolidate all efforts by development partners\u2019 ongoing initiatives \nthat focus on sustaining the national road network. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: increased and more efficient movement \nof people and goods (footnote 5). The project will have the following outcome: improved road \ntransport connectivity and reduced travel time along the crucial north\u2013south land transport link \nfrom Dili to Viqueque.8 The attached transaction TA (para. 20) will underpin the project outcome \nto address underlying road sustainability issues for the national road network by developing a 20-\nyear comprehensive road maintenance strategy, and a road asset management plan. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Improved and safe Baucau to Viqueque highway. The project will finance \ncivil works to upgrade 58 km of national roads from Baucau to Viqueque, including widening the \nexisting 4.5 m wide road to 6.0 m with 1.0 m shoulders, with associated road safety furniture and \nsignage. The improved road will be more resilient to increased rainfall due to improved roadside \ndrainage, raising of the road in flood-prone areas, resilient asphalt pavement surfacing, and \nbioengineering measures to improve slope stability.  It will also finance sheltered bus stops with \nlights at junctions of key feeder roads, appropriately located public toilets, and improved access \nto drinking water for communities. Awareness of road safety and transport-related social issues \nwill be provided to communities in the project area. \n \n13.  Output 2: Institutional strengthening and capacity building. The PMU will continue to \nmanage projects financed by the development partners. Under the project, the PMU will provide \ncapacity building to seconded staff from the DRBFC so that externally funded consultants in the \nPMU are phased out and skills are developed and replaced with the government\u2019s own resources \nand project management office.9 More broadly, this will not only mainstream project management, \nbut also strengthen the roads subsector administrative capacity of the DRBFC and support long-\nterm sustainability. \n \n                                                \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  In addition to capacity building for DRBFC staff on project management, the project also supports institutional \nstrengthening for road maintenance and land transport regulation, as described in the Attached Technical Assistance \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $77.78 million (Table 1). \n \n15.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM). Major expenditure items include civil works and consulting \nservices. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

Such an amount does not represent an excessive share of the project cost. \nb  In mid-2017 prices as of April 2017. \nc  The unallocated amount refers to contingencies. Physical contingencies computed at 10% for civil works for \nunforeseen  expenditures,  additional  improvements  to  address  climate  change,  road  safety  and  social \ninclusiveness, and studies for future project scale up and preparation. Price contingencies computed at average \nof 3.03% on foreign exchange costs and 5.05% on local currency costs; includes provision for potential exchange \nrate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \nd  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the concessional ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) loan has been computed at 2.0% per year. Interest during construction for the regular OCR loan \nhas been computed at the 5-year United States dollar fixed swap rate plus an effective contractual spread of 0.5% \nand maturity premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for the regular OCR loan are 0.15% per year to be charged \non the undisbursed loan amount. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16.  The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $19 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, and (ii) a concessional loan of $25 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance the project. The regular loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is \n15.3 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. The concessional loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year \nduring the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. \n \n17.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil works, and consulting services for construction supervision.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The executing agency will be the Council for the Administration of the Infrastructure Fund \n(CAFI) and the implementing agency will be the MPWTC.10 The PMU manages externally \nsupported major road upgrading projects. While each development partner maintains separate \nresponsibility for its respective projects, a single PMU is in charge of project monitoring and \nreporting as well as the safeguards assessments and monitoring system, thereby reducing the \nproject management costs. The PMU will undertake the day-to-day project management, and \nassist the National Procurement Commission with the preparation of bidding documents for civil \nworks and terms of reference for consultants\u2019 services. The National Procurement Commission \nwill  procure  civil  works  using  international  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and recruit consultants\u2019 services \ncontracts using quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  The transaction TA for Promoting Sustainable Land Transport Infrastructure will support \ntwo outputs: (i) a comprehensive NRMSP for the DRBFC maintenance unit, and (ii) updated \nnational land transport legislation and regulations to establish an autonomous and financially \nsustainable  national  land  transport  authority.  The  first  output  will  focus  on  (i)  undertaking \norganizational reform to implement a 20-year road maintenance strategy; (ii) defining the levels \nof service expected from the national road network; (iii) formulating a road asset management \nsystem and plan; and (iv) developing an operations manual focusing on planning, budgeting, \nprocurement, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation for the DRBFC maintenance unit. The \nTA will prepare a programmatic approach for road maintenance in coordination with other \ndevelopment partners active in the sector. The second output will review the legislative and \nregulatory framework for vehicle registrations, driver licensing, road safety, and vehicle weight \nlimits. The TA will be implemented from March 2018 to December 2020. The Ministry of Planning \nand Finance will be the executing agency. The DRBFC maintenance unit will be the implementing \nagency for the first output, and the DNTT will be the implementing agency for the second output.12 \n \n21.  The transaction TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  Detailed design has been completed for the proposed Baucau to Viqueque road upgrade. \nThe project will widen the existing 4.5 m road to 6.0 m with 1.0 m shoulders, rehabilitate the \nsubbase and base course, and upgrade to a 50-millimeter-thick polymer-modified asphalt surface. \nThe road alignment design is governed by topography rather than geometry to minimize land \nacquisition, earthworks, and other costly construction requirements. To ensure climate resilience, \nthe roadside drainage will be improved and has been informed by hydrology and hydraulic \nanalysis. The design also includes slope protection and grading based on geotechnical analysis, \nretaining structures, and bioengineering measures. Road safety measures will be implemented, \nincluding guardrails, separate pedestrian walkways on reconstructed bridges and in areas where \npedestrian traffic is high, thermoplastic line markings, traffic calming near schools and public \nmarkets, and appropriate road signage. A community consultation process has been developed \nto identify appropriate locations for bus shelters, lighting, and public toilet facilities, and to improve \naccess to water sources for communities in the project area during implementation. Separate \ncommunity and driver road safety campaigns will also be implemented. \n                                                \n12 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic analysis has been carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. Evaluation of annual streams of project economic costs and \nassociated benefits under a baseline scenario yields an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nof 11.9%, and an economic net present value of $20.2 million. This confirms the project\u2019s \neconomic viability, as its EIRR exceeds ADB\u2019s minimum required EIRR for investment projects of \n9%. Quantifiable road user benefits include reductions in VOCs and time savings from traveling \non the upgraded road. Unquantified benefits from the project include (i) reduced frequency of, \nand losses from, vehicular accidents due to improved road safety; (ii) large potential gains in \ninduced traffic driven by a decline in VOCs and complementary developments to stimulate \nindustrial and tourism activity; (iii) better health and education outcomes resulting from better \naccess to health and school facilities; (iv) generation of employment opportunities from improved \naccess to markets; and (v) a possible boost to agriculture activity given the project area\u2019s \nimportance in achieving basic food supply targets as outlined in Timor-Leste\u2019s SDP, 2011\u20132030 \n(footnote 6). \n \n24.  The DRBFC established its maintenance unit in 2015 with 17 full-time staff. Since the \nestablishment of this maintenance unit, the DRBFC has received two cycles of road maintenance \nbudget in 2015 (for $4.0 million) and in 2016 (for $3.8 million), against its annual budget requests \nof $25.0 million. This is inadequate to sustain the national road network, and additional resources \nwill be required when road rehabilitation projects are completed. The DRBFC remains unable to \nutilize allocations on a timely basis because of its weak institutional setup. The attached TA will \nprovide support to the DRBFC maintenance unit in developing a comprehensive NRMSP to \nsustain the upgraded road infrastructure over the long term. \n \n25.  Further, an additional financing proposal will be pursued nearer to the completion of this \nproject to provide routine maintenance of the upgraded Baucau to Viqueque road for the first 3 \nyears of its operation on a pilot basis. This approach would replicate community-based rural roads \nroutine  maintenance  methods  successfully  implemented  under  the  ongoing  Roads  for \nDevelopment program (financed by the Government of Australia) on rural roads. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The public financial management system in Timor-Leste is centralized, and has numerous \ncontrols designed to promote prudent financial management in place. All signed contracts above \n$5 million require approval of the High Administrative, Tax and Audit Court in Timor-Leste to have \nlegal force. This may pose a procurement-related risk to the government and ADB, where \nrejection of the award of a contract may be contrary to ADB\u2019s \u201cno objection\u201d given on the \ngovernment\u2019s bid evaluation. This risk is mitigated with an assurance in the loan agreement, which \nstipulates that no withdrawals will be made from the loan to finance any contract package until \nthe relevant approval has been obtained by the Audit Court of Timor-Leste. \n \n27.  The MPWTC has implemented several ADB infrastructure projects through the PMU.  \nBased on previous project implementation experience, the PMU has sufficient capacity to manage \nthe financial aspects of the project, although there is a pressing need to transfer skills within the \nMPWTC to ensure long-term sustainability of this capacity. The financial management risk is \nmoderate,  mainly  because  of  (i)  capacity  within  the  PMU  to  meet  covenants  on  auditing, \naccounting, and reporting; and (ii) rigorous controls in place within the central government to \nensure project expenditures are transparent. \n ", "8 \n  \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  CAFI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.   Improving access to transport is critical to alleviating poverty. Increasing mobility assists \ndevelopment and enables access to basic social services and access of the poor to vital services \nsuch as schools, health clinics, and markets, all of which have critical importance for women. The \npoorest sector of the population in Timor-Leste faces the risk of road accidents in catching a bus, \nmicrolet,  or  angguna  (small  pick-up  truck).  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. The impacts on women will be positive through their improved access to markets \nto sell their products as well as buy a greater variety of fruits, vegetables, and protein. Safety is a \nmajor issue for pedestrians, especially women and children. Due to the increased quality of the \nroad, public transport services will become both safer and more frequent. In addition, safety for \npedestrians will be improved through the provision of separate footpaths at crossings, and near \nschools and public markets. As women currently travel the road in the dark to access transport to \nmarkets, this is a major benefit for women. Road safety and gender-awareness programs will be \nconducted through male-, female-, and child-targeted posters and leaflets designed for bus \nshelters, schools, health clinics, and cafes. A gender action plan has been prepared, which \noutlines all the gender targets and indicators.13 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009, the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \n31.  Environment (category B). Following the process and procedures already established \nby the PMU, the environmental assessment is reported in the simplified environmental impact \nstatement (SEIS), which is equivalent to an initial environmental examination, and includes an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). The SEIS has been reviewed by ADB to ensure that in \naddition to meeting the national requirements for environment, it complies with the requirements \nof ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Environmental impacts will be similar in scale to those of \ncompleted and ongoing national road projects. The main impacts will be during the construction \nstage and will include (i) vegetation and tree removal, and utilities relocation during site clearing \nand establishment works; (ii) dust, noise, runoff, sedimentation, and slope stability issues from \nearthworks, including excavations; and (iii) waste generation, spoil disposal, health and safety, \nand traffic management issues during construction activities. The road alignment traverses close \nto three protected areas. The potential impacts will be site-specific and readily mitigated. Few, if \nany, of the impacts will be irreversible. As reported in the SEIS, meaningful consultation was \nundertaken. The grievance redress mechanism established for ongoing projects is included in the \nSEIS, and will be implemented under the project. The draft SEIS has been disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite and will be updated. Upon completion, it will be disclosed locally. \n \n32.  The  process  of  minerals  license  application  will  require  preparation  of  a  location \napplication, mining plan, and site-specific EMP for each new materials source. Training and \nsupport will be provided by construction supervision consultants to the successful contractor to \n                                                \n13 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nprepare and implement the construction EMP, submit the minerals license applications, and \nmonitor construction EMP compliance. Capacity building of DRBFC environmental safeguards \nstaff will be provided through mentoring and on-the-job training by the PMU and construction \nsupervision consultants, as detailed in the PAM. Particular conditions of contract in the bidding \ndocuments include provisions for the employer to enforce environment safeguards compliance. \n \n33.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the \nBaucau\u2013Venilale and Venilale\u2013Viqueque road sections based on the detailed design completed \nin 2015. These resettlement plans will be updated to validate all impacts. The improvement of \nroads is expected to be mostly within the existing road corridor, but will require small areas of \nagricultural land; removal of crops and trees; and permanent and temporary impacts on residential \nhouses, shops, and roadside stalls and kiosks. There are an estimated 82 affected households \nor 402 affected persons, but only 34 households or 146 persons will experience significant \nimpacts from physical and/or economic displacement. The MPWTC will ensure that affected \npersons receive entitlements and compensation following the resettlement plan. Key stakeholders \nand  affected  persons  have  been  consulted  during  the  resettlement  plan  preparation  and \ndisclosure, and will be further consulted during the resettlement plan update and implementation. \nThe PMU will be responsible for overall monitoring and supervision of safeguards activities, \nworking closely with the construction supervision consultants. The capacity building of the DRBFC \nsafeguard staff by the PMU is ongoing with ADB\u2019s financing through other road projects. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998) since no distinct or vulnerable indigenous groups will be affected by the project. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelay in approval or rejection of  Country procedures require approval of the signed contract \ncontract by the Audit Court of Timor- by Audit Court of Timor-Leste.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n36.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n37.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the draft loan agreements. The government has agreed with ADB on the following \ncondition for disbursement: no withdrawals shall be made from the loan account for carrying out \nany works for the project in relation to one individual contract package until an approval from the \nHigh Administrative, Tax and Audit Court of Timor-Leste, as applicable, has been obtained in \nrespect of that individual contract package. The government has also agreed with ADB that the \neffectiveness of the regular loan is subject to the effectiveness of the concessional loan. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $19,000,000 to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Baucau to \nViqueque Highway Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the loan of $25,000,000 to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Baucau to \nViqueque Highway Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional \nterms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per year; for a term of 25 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n30 January 2018 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nIncreased and more efficient movement of people and goodsa \n  \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:     \n       \nRoad transport  a.
