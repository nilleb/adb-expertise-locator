The report \nalso  describes  the  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Promoting  Sustainable \nLand Transport Infrastructure, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe project will (i) upgrade 58 kilometers (km) of national roads from Baucau to Viqueque, \n2. \nwith  considerations  for  better  resilience  to  climate  change  and  social  inclusive  design;  and  (ii) \nprovide institutional strengthening and capacity building. The project supports continuing efforts \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners to upgrade and sustain \nthe country\u2019s national road network. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nTimor-Leste has the third largest economy among ADB\u2019s 14 Pacific developing member \ncountries, with gross domestic product\u2014excluding offshore petroleum operations\u2014at about $1.5 \nbillion as of 2016. Largely because of its petroleum wealth, the country has attained lower middle-\nincome  and  medium  human  development  status.  However,  about  70%  of  the  1.2  million \npopulation still live in rural areas and rely on subsistence agriculture. There is a high maternal \nmortality rate (557 per 100,000 live births) and a high infant mortality rate (64 per 1,000 live births) \ndue  to  poverty  and  poor  access  to  primary  health  care.1 Formal  employment  opportunities  are \nmostly found in the public sector, with very little manufacturing and production for export in the \nprivate sector. \n \nADB has a strong track record in the sector. A 25-year period of conflict from 1975 to \n4. \n1999 suppressed any significant investment in maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network \nin  Timor-Leste  prior  to  independence  in  2002.  Progressive  deterioration  leading  to  poor  road \nconditions  continued  over  most  of  the  first  decade  of  independence.  To  help  address  road \nconnectivity and safety in Timor-Leste, ADB has financed a series of transport sector projects, \nincluding the Road Network Development Sector Project, the Road Network Upgrading Project, \nand  the  Road  Network  Upgrading  Sector  Project. 2  ADB  is  also  cofinancing  with  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) the upgrading of the Dili\u2013Baucau road.3 In combination \nwith other development partner-supported projects, about 560 km or 39% of the most important \nsections  of  the  national  road  network  are  expected  to  be  upgraded  by  the  end  of  2019.4 The \n\n                                                 \n1  Sustainable Development Goal 3 targets a maternal mortality rate of less than 70 per 100,000 live births, and an \n\ninfant mortality rate of 12 per 1,000 live births. \n\n2  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n\n3  ADB.  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Dili to Baucau Highway Project. Manila. \n\n4  For example, ADB is cofinancing the upgrading of the Dili\u2013Baucau road together with JICA, while the World Bank is \n\nfinancing the upgrading of the Dili\u2013Ainaro road. \n\n \n\n\fproject targets a crucial north\u2013south component of the land transport network, extending ADB\u2019s \ncoverage of national road network upgrading from past and ongoing road projects. \n \n5. \nThe  key  priority  under  the  government\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  (SDP)  for  2011\u2013\n2030  aims to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  all  existing  roads  and  bridges  by  2020,  establish  a ring \nnational  highway,  and  deliver  a  comprehensive  road  maintenance  program  by  2030. 5 ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Timor-Leste,  2016\u20132020  emphasizes  the  need  for  additional \ninfrastructure  investment  to  support  inclusive  growth  and  the  development  of  systems  for \noperation and maintenance to help sustain recent progress.6  \n \n6. \nThe Baucau to Viqueque Highway is an important national corridor. It links Viqueque \nDistrict and the south coast of Laut\u00e9m to Baucau District, and to the capital city of Dili. The existing \nroad is generally 4.5 meters (m) wide, mostly unsealed, and in poor condition; it takes up to 10 \nhours to commute between Dili and Viqueque by bus. Substantial reductions in travel time and \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs) are expected from upgrading the road, leading to improved road \nsafety and better access to markets, health clinics, schools, and other community services. The \ngovernment is planning the development of a downstream petrochemical industrial hub on the \nsouth  coast  through  its  Tasi  Mane  project.  The  project  will  support  not  only  this  government \ninitiative but also the broader economic development of agriculture-rich and high tourism potential \ndistricts on Timor-Leste\u2019s southern coast. \n \n7. \nSupport  to  transport  agencies  is  crucial  for  long  term  sustainability.  Under  the \nMinistry of Public Works, Transport and Communications (MPWTC), the Directorate of Roads, \nBridges  and  Flood  Control  (DRBFC)  is  responsible  for  national  road  and  bridge  planning, \nmaintenance, construction and improvements, and flood protection. As increasing lengths of new \nand rehabilitated roads are being developed, the DRBFC recently established a maintenance unit \nin  2015  that  is  being  supported  by  an  ongoing  3-year  capacity  development  program  for  road \nmaintenance by JICA. JICA is also providing support in establishing a road maintenance fund. \nThe  government,  development  partners,  and  other  stakeholders  agree  that  the  most  critical \nobstacle  to  sustaining  capital  investments  made  so  far  in  the  roads  subsector  from  premature \ndeterioration  is  the  absence  of  a  comprehensive  national  road  maintenance  strategy  and  plan \n(NRMSP). The project, through the attached transaction TA, will support the development of a \nNRMSP to improve road maintenance planning and asset management. \n \n8. \nThe  DRBFC  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  major  road  improvement  and \nrehabilitation  projects.  Due  to  previous  weak  implementation  capacity,  an  ADB-financed  TA  is \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  a  capacity  development  framework  and  strategy  for  the \nMPWTC.7 The project management unit (PMU) under the DRBFC is responsible for managing \nADB,  JICA,  and  World  Bank  projects,  and  has  successfully  coordinated  these  development \npartners and ensured that consistent technical standards and safeguards have been applied. \n \n9. \nThe  MPWTC,  through  the  National  Directorate  of  Land  Transport  (DNTT),  is  also \nresponsible  for  regulating  land  and  public  transport,  issuing  driver\u2019s  licenses  and  vehicle \nregistrations,  overseeing  traffic  management,  and  controlling  vehicle  overloading.  In  2016,  the \nMinistry of Interior established the National Directorate of Road Safety responsible for planning, \ncoordinating, and implementing national road safety policy, and applying road safety laws. The \nDepartment  of  Traffic  and  Road  Safety  under  the  Timor-Leste  National  Police  enforces  road \n\n                                                 \n5  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

The  project,  through  the  attached  transaction  TA,  will  support \ntransitioning the DNTT and National Directorate of Road Safety to an autonomous national land \ntransport authority, which would consolidate national responsibility, improve the standard of land \ntransport regulation and management, and help increase nontax revenue that could support road \nmaintenance. \n \n10. \nValue added by ADB assistance. There are various initiatives by development partners \nto address road maintenance. However, these efforts have largely been fragmented and driven \nprimarily by development partners\u2019 individual TA and capacity support programs. The project will \nprepare  a  comprehensive  strategy  and  plan  for  road  maintenance  and  strengthen the  existing \nDRBFC maintenance unit, complementing JICA\u2019s capacity efforts and road fund establishment. \nIt is envisaged that this strategy and plan will formulate a long-term programmatic approach for \nroutine and periodic maintenance as well as emergency work for the national road network. The \nstrategy and plan also aim to consolidate all efforts by development partners\u2019 ongoing initiatives \nthat focus on sustaining the national road network. \n \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n11. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: increased and more efficient movement \nof  people  and  goods  (footnote  5).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  improved  road \ntransport connectivity and reduced travel time along the crucial north\u2013south land transport link \nfrom Dili to Viqueque.8 The attached transaction TA (para. 20) will underpin the project outcome \nto address underlying road sustainability issues for the national road network by developing a 20-\nyear comprehensive road maintenance strategy, and a road asset management plan. \n \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n12. \nOutput 1: Improved and safe Baucau to Viqueque highway. The project will finance \ncivil works to upgrade 58 km of national roads from Baucau to Viqueque, including widening the \nexisting 4.5 m wide road to 6.0 m with 1.0 m shoulders, with associated road safety furniture and \nsignage. The improved road will be more resilient to increased rainfall due to improved roadside \ndrainage,  raising  of  the  road  in  flood-prone  areas,  resilient  asphalt  pavement  surfacing,  and \nbioengineering measures to improve slope stability.  It will also finance sheltered bus stops with \nlights at junctions of key feeder roads, appropriately located public toilets, and improved access \nto drinking water for communities. Awareness of road safety and transport-related social issues \nwill be provided to communities in the project area. \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Institutional strengthening and capacity building. The PMU will continue to \nmanage projects financed by the development partners. Under the project, the PMU will provide \ncapacity building to seconded staff from the DRBFC so that externally funded consultants in the \nPMU are phased out and skills are developed and replaced with the government\u2019s own resources \nand project management office.9 More broadly, this will not only mainstream project management, \nbut also strengthen the roads subsector administrative capacity of the DRBFC and support long-\nterm sustainability. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  In  addition  to  capacity  building  for  DRBFC  staff  on  project  management,  the  project  also  supports  institutional \nstrengthening for road maintenance and land transport regulation, as described in the Attached Technical Assistance \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $77.78 million (Table 1). \n\n \n14. \n \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \n15. \nproject administration manual (PAM).

Such an amount does not represent an excessive share of the project cost. \n\nb  In mid-2017 prices as of April 2017. \nc  The  unallocated  amount  refers  to  contingencies.  Physical  contingencies  computed  at  10%  for  civil  works  for \nunforeseen  expenditures,  additional  improvements  to  address  climate  change,  road  safety  and  social \ninclusiveness, and studies for future project scale up and preparation. Price contingencies computed at average \nof 3.03% on foreign exchange costs and 5.05% on local currency costs; includes provision for potential exchange \nrate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \n\nd  Includes  interest  and  commitment  charges.  Interest  during  construction  for  the  concessional  ordinary  capital \nresources (OCR) loan has been computed at 2.0% per year. Interest during construction for the regular OCR loan \nhas been computed at the 5-year United States dollar fixed swap rate plus an effective contractual spread of 0.5% \nand maturity premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for the regular OCR loan are 0.15% per year to be charged \non the undisbursed loan amount. \n\nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n16. \nThe government has requested (i) a regular loan of $19 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, and (ii) a concessional loan of $25 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance the project. The regular loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is \n15.3 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. The concessional loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year \nduring the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. \n \n17. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2.

The  first  output  will  focus  on  (i)  undertaking \norganizational reform to implement a 20-year road maintenance strategy; (ii) defining the levels \nof service expected from the national road network; (iii) formulating a road asset management \nsystem  and  plan;  and  (iv)  developing  an  operations  manual  focusing  on  planning,  budgeting, \nprocurement, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation for the DRBFC maintenance unit. The \nTA  will  prepare  a  programmatic  approach  for  road  maintenance  in  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment  partners  active  in  the  sector.  The  second  output  will  review  the  legislative  and \nregulatory framework for  vehicle  registrations,  driver  licensing, road  safety,  and  vehicle  weight \nlimits. The TA will be implemented from March 2018 to December 2020. The Ministry of Planning \nand Finance will be the executing agency. The DRBFC maintenance unit will be the implementing \nagency for the first output, and the DNTT will be the implementing agency for the second output.12 \n \nThe  transaction  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.0  million,  which  will  be  financed  on  a  grant \n21. \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nDetailed design has been completed for the proposed Baucau to Viqueque road upgrade. \n22. \nThe  project  will  widen  the  existing  4.5  m  road  to  6.0  m  with  1.0  m  shoulders,  rehabilitate  the \nsubbase and base course, and upgrade to a 50-millimeter-thick polymer-modified asphalt surface. \nThe  road  alignment  design  is  governed  by  topography  rather  than  geometry  to  minimize  land \nacquisition, earthworks, and other costly construction requirements. To ensure climate resilience, \nthe  roadside  drainage  will  be  improved  and  has  been  informed  by  hydrology  and  hydraulic \nanalysis. The design also includes slope protection and grading based on geotechnical analysis, \nretaining structures, and bioengineering measures. Road safety measures will be implemented, \nincluding guardrails, separate pedestrian walkways on reconstructed bridges and in areas where \npedestrian  traffic  is  high,  thermoplastic  line  markings,  traffic  calming  near  schools  and  public \nmarkets, and appropriate road signage. A community consultation process has been developed \nto identify appropriate locations for bus shelters, lighting, and public toilet facilities, and to improve \naccess  to  water  sources  for  communities  in  the  project  area  during  implementation.  Separate \ncommunity and driver road safety campaigns will also be implemented. \n                                                 \n12 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\n \nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Evaluation  of  annual  streams  of  project  economic  costs  and \nassociated benefits under a baseline scenario yields an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nof  11.9%,  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of  $20.2  million.  This  confirms  the  project\u2019s \neconomic viability, as its EIRR exceeds ADB\u2019s minimum required EIRR for investment projects of \n9%. Quantifiable road user benefits include reductions in VOCs and time savings from traveling \non  the  upgraded road. Unquantified  benefits from the  project  include  (i) reduced frequency  of, \nand  losses  from,  vehicular  accidents  due  to  improved  road  safety;  (ii)  large  potential  gains  in \ninduced  traffic  driven  by  a  decline  in  VOCs  and  complementary  developments  to  stimulate \nindustrial  and  tourism  activity;  (iii)  better  health  and  education  outcomes  resulting  from  better \naccess to health and school facilities; (iv) generation of employment opportunities from improved \naccess  to  markets;  and  (v)  a  possible  boost  to  agriculture  activity  given  the  project  area\u2019s \nimportance in achieving basic food supply targets as outlined in Timor-Leste\u2019s SDP, 2011\u20132030 \n(footnote 6). \n \n24. \nThe  DRBFC  established  its  maintenance  unit  in  2015  with  17  full-time  staff.  Since  the \nestablishment of this maintenance unit, the DRBFC has received two cycles of road maintenance \nbudget in 2015 (for $4.0 million) and in 2016 (for $3.8 million), against its annual budget requests \nof $25.0 million. This is inadequate to sustain the national road network, and additional resources \nwill be required when road rehabilitation projects are completed. The DRBFC remains unable to \nutilize allocations on a timely basis because of its weak institutional setup. The attached TA will \nprovide  support  to  the  DRBFC  maintenance  unit  in  developing  a  comprehensive  NRMSP  to \nsustain the upgraded road infrastructure over the long term. \n \n25. \nFurther, an additional financing proposal will be pursued nearer to the completion of this \nproject to provide routine maintenance of the upgraded Baucau to Viqueque road for the first 3 \nyears of its operation on a pilot basis. This approach would replicate community-based rural roads \nroutine  maintenance  methods  successfully  implemented  under  the  ongoing  Roads  for \nDevelopment program (financed by the Government of Australia) on rural roads. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe public financial management system in Timor-Leste is centralized, and has numerous \ncontrols designed to promote prudent financial management in place. All signed contracts above \n$5 million require approval of the High Administrative, Tax and Audit Court in Timor-Leste to have \nlegal  force.  This  may  pose  a  procurement-related  risk  to  the  government  and  ADB,  where \nrejection  of  the  award  of  a  contract  may  be  contrary  to  ADB\u2019s  \u201cno  objection\u201d  given  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s bid evaluation. This risk is mitigated with an assurance in the loan agreement, which \nstipulates that no withdrawals will be made from the loan to finance any contract package until \nthe relevant approval has been obtained by the Audit Court of Timor-Leste. \n \nThe  MPWTC  has  implemented  several  ADB  infrastructure  projects  through  the  PMU.  \n27. \nBased on previous project implementation experience, the PMU has sufficient capacity to manage \nthe financial aspects of the project, although there is a pressing need to transfer skills within the \nMPWTC  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability  of  this  capacity.  The  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate,  mainly  because  of  (i)  capacity  within  the  PMU  to  meet  covenants  on  auditing, \naccounting,  and  reporting;  and  (ii)  rigorous  controls  in  place  within  the  central  government  to \nensure project expenditures are transparent. \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n  \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  CAFI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n29. \n Improving access to transport is critical to alleviating poverty. Increasing mobility assists \ndevelopment and enables access to basic social services and access of the poor to vital services \nsuch as schools, health clinics, and markets, all of which have critical importance for women. The \npoorest sector of the population in Timor-Leste faces the risk of road accidents in catching a bus, \nmicrolet,  or  angguna  (small  pick-up  truck).  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. The impacts on women will be positive through their improved access to markets \nto sell their products as well as buy a greater variety of fruits, vegetables, and protein. Safety is a \nmajor issue for pedestrians, especially women and children. Due to the increased quality of the \nroad, public transport services will become both safer and more frequent. In addition, safety for \npedestrians will be improved through the provision of separate footpaths at crossings, and near \nschools and public markets. As women currently travel the road in the dark to access transport to \nmarkets, this is a major benefit for women. Road safety and gender-awareness programs will be \nconducted  through  male-,  female-,  and  child-targeted  posters  and  leaflets  designed  for  bus \nshelters,  schools,  health  clinics,  and  cafes.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared,  which \noutlines all the gender targets and indicators.13 \n \nE. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \nEnvironment (category B). Following the process and procedures already established \n31. \nby  the  PMU,  the  environmental  assessment  is  reported  in  the  simplified  environmental  impact \nstatement (SEIS),  which  is  equivalent  to  an  initial  environmental  examination,  and  includes  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). The SEIS has been reviewed by ADB to ensure that in \naddition to meeting the national requirements for environment, it complies with the requirements \nof ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Environmental impacts will be similar in scale to those of \ncompleted and ongoing national road projects. The main impacts will be during the construction \nstage and will include (i) vegetation and tree removal, and utilities relocation during site clearing \nand establishment works; (ii) dust, noise, runoff, sedimentation, and slope stability issues from \nearthworks, including excavations; and (iii) waste generation, spoil disposal, health and safety, \nand traffic management issues during construction activities. The road alignment traverses close \nto three protected areas. The potential impacts will be site-specific and readily mitigated. Few, if \nany,  of  the  impacts  will  be  irreversible.  As  reported  in  the  SEIS,  meaningful  consultation  was \nundertaken. The grievance redress mechanism established for ongoing projects is included in the \nSEIS, and will be implemented under the project. The draft SEIS has been disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite and will be updated. Upon completion, it will be disclosed locally. \n \n32. \nThe  process  of  minerals  license  application  will  require  preparation  of  a  location \napplication,  mining  plan,  and  site-specific  EMP  for  each  new  materials  source.  Training  and \nsupport will be provided by construction supervision consultants to the successful contractor to \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  2009,  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n                                                 \n13 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB.

Capacity  building  of  DRBFC  environmental  safeguards \nstaff  will  be  provided  through  mentoring  and  on-the-job  training  by  the  PMU  and  construction \nsupervision consultants, as detailed in the PAM. Particular conditions of contract in the bidding \ndocuments include provisions for the employer to enforce environment safeguards compliance. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the \nBaucau\u2013Venilale and Venilale\u2013Viqueque road sections based on the detailed design completed \nin 2015. These resettlement plans will be updated to validate all impacts. The improvement of \nroads is expected to be mostly within the existing road corridor, but will require small areas of \nagricultural land; removal of crops and trees; and permanent and temporary impacts on residential \nhouses, shops, and roadside stalls and kiosks. There are an estimated 82 affected households \nor  402  affected  persons,  but  only  34  households  or  146  persons  will  experience  significant \nimpacts  from  physical  and/or  economic  displacement.  The  MPWTC  will  ensure  that  affected \npersons receive entitlements and compensation following the resettlement plan. Key stakeholders \nand  affected  persons  have  been  consulted  during  the  resettlement  plan  preparation  and \ndisclosure, and will be further consulted during the resettlement plan update and implementation. \nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  monitoring  and  supervision  of  safeguards  activities, \nworking closely with the construction supervision consultants. The capacity building of the DRBFC \nsafeguard staff by the PMU is ongoing with ADB\u2019s financing through other road projects. \n \n34. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project will not trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998) since no distinct or vulnerable indigenous groups will be affected by the project. \n \nF. \n \n35. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nDelay in approval or rejection of \ncontract by the Audit Court of Timor-\nLeste after the National Procurement \nCommission issues letter of \nacceptance to the lowest evaluated \nbidder \nImplementation delays due to \ngovernment not providing adequate \ncounterpart resources for qualified \nproject management staff and \nconsultants \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nCountry procedures require approval of the signed contract \nby Audit Court of Timor-Leste. Rejection by the audit court \nafter issuance of the letter of acceptance may result in \nmisprocurement. Assurances and disbursement conditions \nwere included in the loan agreement to mitigate against the \nrisk. \nThe loan agreement includes covenants for the government to \nensure (i) sufficient  budget allocation and timely payment to \nproject management staff and consultants, (ii) the structure of \nthe project management office is retained and fully staffed with \nqualified  experts,  and  (iii)  that  external  experts  engaged \ntransfer skills and provide capacity building to local staff. \nThe loan agreement includes a covenant for the government \nto submit the road maintenance strategy and plan to the \nCouncil of Ministers for approval by 2020, which will be \nprepared under the attached transaction technical \nassistance.
