The  design  and \nmonitoring framework and the development effectiveness framework are presented in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n2. \nIndia  is  endowed  with  abundant  renewable  energy  sources\u2014solar,  wind,  biomass,  and \nsmall hydroelectric\u2014and the Government of India is working proactively to develop them. Under \nthe \u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d initiative, the Government has envisaged universal electricity supply by \n2012. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of the Government of India, formerly \nthe  Ministry  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources  (MNES),  has  proposed  exploiting  the  full \npotential  of  renewable  energy  sources  to  increase  generation  capacity  in  the  country.  The \nNational Electricity Policy, issued by the Ministry of Power, Government of India on 12 February \n2005, also emphasizes the development of renewable energy sources. \n \n3. \nSince  its  inception,  India\u2019s  renewable  energy  program  has  been  driven  by  policies  and \npromotional  measures  initially  framed  by  MNRE  and  subsequently  by  India\u2019s  respective  state \ngovernments. The promotional measures available to renewable energy projects comprise a wide \nrange  of  fiscal  and  financial  incentives,  including  soft  loans,  concessional  customs  duties, \nexemption from excise duty, tax holidays, and accelerated depreciation benefits. \n \nTo  accelerate  the  promotion  of  renewable  energy  development  in  their  respective  states, \n4. \nboth the Gujarat Electricity Regulation Commission (GERC) and Karnataka Electricity Regulatory \nCommission  (KERC)  have  stipulated  minimum  amounts  of  renewable  energy  purchase \nobligations  on  licensed  distributors  operating  in  the  states.  Starting  2010,  GERC  will  require \nlicensed  distributors  to  procure  at  least  2%  of  their  total  energy  input  from  renewable  energy \nsources. The KERC has stipulated that 10% of energy purchase by distributors should be in the \nform of renewable energy. \n \nGPEC  is  an  existing,  single-asset  company  that  currently  owns  and  operates  a  655 \n5. \nmegawatt  (MW)  gas-fired  power  plant  at  Bharuch,  Gujarat,  India.  GPEC  belongs  to  the  CLP \nGroup (founded in 1901 as the China Light and Power Company Limited) and is 100% indirectly \nowned  by  CLP  Holdings  Limited,  Hong  Kong.  The  CLP  Group  consists  of  a  conglomerate  of \ncompanies with a portfolio of over 30 generation assets and retail businesses in different countries \nin  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  The  group  has  investments  in  over  30,000  MW  gross  generation \nassets. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has an existing satisfactory relationship with the CLP \nGroup through its 2003 financing of BLCP Power Limited, a 1,434 MW coal-fired power plant in \nThailand1.  Over  the  last  few  years,  the  CLP  group  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to  the \nprinciples of sustainable development and has been taking a proactive stance towards addressing \nissues  related  to  climate  change.  In  2004,  the  group  set  a  target  of  generating  5%  of  its  output \nfrom  renewable  sources  by  2010,  which  was  met  3  years  ahead  of  time.  As  a  part  of  the  CLP \nGroup,  GPEC  also  has  a  major  thrust  toward  renewable  energy.  In  light  of  the  increasing \nregulatory support for wind power generation in India, GPEC has decided to undertake a number \nof wind power projects throughout the country, of which the Project forms the first phase. With the \nsuccessful financial closure of the Tata Power Company\u2019s Khandke and Bramenvel wind power \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2003.

It has approached ADB for long-\nterm debt financing to implement its wind energy projects being set up at Samana, Gujarat and \nSaundatti, Karnataka. Concept clearance for the proposed loan was approved in December 2007 \nand environmental and social site visits were conducted in January 2008. If approved, this would \nbe ADB\u2019s largest assistance to a private sector wind power project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nSector Background in India \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply of Power in India \n\n \nIndia is the third largest electricity consumer in Asia behind the People\u2019s Republic of China \n6. \nand Japan. As of 31 December 2006, installed power generation capacity in India was 127,753 \nMW,  of  which  56%  was  owned  and  operated  by  state  entities,  33%  by  central  public  sector \nundertakings, and 11% by independent power producers and other private sector utilities. Thermal \npower  plants,  mostly  coal-fired,  provide  66%  of  the  installed  capacity.  Hydropower  accounts  for \n26% of the capacity, with gas and oil-fired thermal plants, renewable energy plants, and nuclear \nplants  providing  the  remaining  8%.3  Industry  buys  approximately  35%  of  the  electricity  sold  in \nIndia,  followed  by  households  at  25%,  agriculture  at  22%,  and  businesses  and  others  at  18%.4 \nDespite  its  growing  economy,  India\u2019s  annual  consumption  per  capita  remains  relatively  low  at \nslightly  over  600  kilowatt  hours  (kWh).  In  addition,  power  quality  remains  poor,  marked  by  high \nvoltage fluctuations and recurring load shedding. India continues to suffer from chronic electricity \nshortages,  with  peak  demand  exceeding  supply  by  13.8%  and  the  energy  deficit  at  9.6%  in        \nFY 2007.5 \n \n7. \nPower  demand  in  India  has  grown  rapidly  as  the  economy  has  expanded  at  an  annual \naverage rate of 6.8% in real terms since FY1995.6 As the 10th Five Year Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007) \nachieved only 52% of the targeted capacity addition, energy shortfalls will persist over the short to \nmedium term. Target capacity has been expanded for the 11th Five Year Plan period (FY2008\u2013\nFY2012)  to  78,577  MW,7  so  as  to  catch  up  on  the  longer-term  economic  growth  target.  This  is \nexpected to allow India to achieve the national electricity policy goal of Power for All by 2012 and \nper capita availability of power to reach 1,000 kWh by FY2012. \n \n8. \nsignificant power shortages, as shown in Table 1 below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nBoth  Gujarat  and  Karnataka,  the  states  where  the  Project  will  be  implemented,  face \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2007.

With  continued  and  sustained  hikes  in  oil  and  gas  prices  in  recent  years,  as  well  as  the \nexpected fossil fuel shortages in the future, the security of energy supply in India has generated \nincreasing concern. The environmental concern over excess use of fossil fuels is also on the rise. \nIn  this  context,  India  urgently  needs  to  explore  sustainable  energy  development,  and  the \nGovernment has been working proactively to promote the use of renewable energy sources. \n \n10.  Among  the  renewable  power  resources  available  in  India,  wind  energy  is  a  promising \nsource for further development. India has over 45,000 MW of gross potential and 13,000 MW of \ntechnical potential for wind power. As of September 2007, India had over 7,700 MW of installed \nwind  power  capacity,  ranking  the  country  fourth  in  the  world  after  Germany,  United  States,  and \nSpain.  While  the  10th  Five  Year  Plan  targeted  a  2,200  MW  increase  of  installed  wind  power \ncapacity, over 5,400 MW was actually installed.8 \n \n11. \nincrease  renewable  energy \ncontributions  in  the  country.  It  has  also  issued  policy  guidelines  for  the  state  governments  to \nestablish and maintain state-specific policies to promote renewable power projects. These include \npermission  to  accelerate  depreciation,  concession  or  full  exemption  from  customs  duties,  tax \nholidays, and soft loans available through government-owned agencies. \n \n12.  Gujarat and Karnataka are two of the leading states in wind generation in India. With long \ncoastlines and certain suitable inland areas, these two states account for more than 36% of the \ngross  potential  to  be  harnessed  from  wind  resources,  with  Gujarat  accounting  for  an  estimated \n9,675  MW  of  gross  potential  and  Karnataka  6,620  MW.  As  of  31  March  2007,  installed  wind \npower capacity was 667 MW in Gujarat and 849 MW in Karnataka, which in aggregate accounted \nfor 21% of total installed wind capacity in the country and ranks them among the top four states in \nwind generation. A further 161 MW and 54 MW were installed during the April\u2013September 2007 \nperiod  in  Gujarat  and  Karnataka,  respectively.  A  detailed  summary  of  the  wind  power  sector  in \nIndia is in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n8  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2007.

Mainstreaming poverty reduction is the central organizing theme of ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand  program  (CSP)  for  India.9  It  draws  on  the  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy: \npro-poor  growth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  The  strategy  aims  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  high-growth  agenda  by  assisting  fiscal  consolidation,  infrastructure  development, \nand  private  sector  development.  Political  and  economic  developments  since  finalizing  the  CSP \nindicate that its assistance strategy remains valid, especially the core strategy of poverty reduction \nthrough  infrastructure-led  growth  supported  by  social  development  and  good  governance.  The \n2006\u20132008  CSP10  update  suggests  that  the  objective  of  accelerating  India\u2019s  annual  gross \ndomestic product growth to 8% depends on upgrading infrastructure facilities and improving the \nefficiency of such public services. ADB\u2019s proposed assistance program reflects this priority, with \ninfrastructure  accounting  for  nearly  77%  of  the  3-year  pipeline  (not  including  private  sector  and \nother nonsovereign operations). \n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n \n14.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy11 establishes its operational priorities as (i) reducing poverty \nby, among others, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; (ii) promoting \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investors; (iii) addressing regional and global environmental impacts; and \n(iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  strategy  strongly  encourages  ADB \ninterventions  to  increase  investment  in  the  renewable  energy  subsector,  as  well  as  to  increase \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  take  advantage  of  the  higher  operational \nefficiencies that private operators can achieve and to meet the large capital requirements. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector, as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, has six \nmain  priorities:  (i)  reforming  the  sector;  (ii)  promoting  higher  efficiency  and  low-carbon  power \nsources  that  are  locally  available;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems; (iv) supporting institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity \nAct  of  2003,  including  development  of  more  flexible  power  delivery  and  trading  systems;  (v) \npromoting  private  sector  participation;  and  (vi)  encouraging  energy  conservation,  and  ensuring \nenvironmental  and  social  sustainability.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  Power  for  All  by  2012 \ninitiative,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  power  sector  will  create  synergy  with  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan. \nThis  includes  development  of  sustainable  energy  sources,  particularly  promotion  of  renewable \nenergy projects. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n16.  GPEC owns and operates a single-asset: a 655 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant \nat Paguthan, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The company was set up in 1992 under the name Gujarat \nTorrent  Energy  Corporation  Limited  as  a  joint  venture  between  the  Torrent  Group  of  India, \nPowergen of UK, the government of Gujarat, and Siemens AG. In 2002, Powergen purchased the \nstakes of the other three entities in the joint venture, and in June 2003 divested its entire equity \nstake in favor of the CLP Group. CLP Holdings, the group holding company, currently has 100% \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2003.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2003\u20132006):  India.

The combined cycle power \nplant  has  been  operational  since  1997  and  sells  its  entire  electrical  output  to  GUVNL,  which  in \nturn sells it to four distribution companies in Gujarat. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  CLP  Group  is  one  of  the  leading  investor-owned  power  utilities  in  Asia.  It  is  a \nconglomerate of companies with a portfolio of over 30 generation assets and retail businesses in \ndifferent  countries  in  the  Asia  Pacific.  CLP  Holdings  Limited  (rated  A  [negative  creditwatch]/A-1 \n[negative  creditwatch]  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s/Moody\u2019s),  is  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock \nExchange and had a market capitalization of approximately $19 billion as of 31 January 2008. The \nCLP Group registered total revenues of $5.8 billion in 2006 and earnings of $1.3 billion. In Hong \nKong,  China,  the  CLP  Group  operates  through  CLP  Power  Hong  Kong  Limited,  a  vertically \nintegrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business with an installed capacity \nof  6,908  MW  and  a  transmission  capacity  of  12,000  kilometers  (km).  The  CLP  Group  supplies \nelectricity to approximately 80% of the population in Hong Kong, China.  \n \n18.  GPEC is the CLP Group\u2019s first investment in India and will be the investment vehicle for all \nof the group\u2019s wholly owned projects in the country. GPEC derives strong management, technical \nand  financial  support  from  its  parent.  Its  top  management  is  nominated  by  CLP\u2019s  board  and  its \nmanaging director is a part of the CLP Group\u2019s senior management team. GPEC is managed by \nnine  directors  on  its  board,  of  which  seven  represent  the  CLP  Group  and  two  represent  local \nfinancial institutions. Rajiv Mishra, the managing director of the company, handles the day-to-day \nmanagement of GPEC under the supervision and control of the board of directors. As of 30 June \n2007, the company had 119 employees. \n \n19. \nThe  CLP  Group  has  a  well-established  code  on  corporate  governance  and  policies.  The \ncode applies to directors, officers, and employees of CLP Holdings; its wholly owned subsidiaries; \nand joint ventures or companies in which the group holds a controlling interest. In the case of joint \nventures  or  companies  in  which  the  CLP  Group  does  not  hold  a  controlling  interest,  the  CLP \nrepresentatives concerned are expected to act in accordance with the code themselves and to do \neverything possible to influence those with whom they are working to ensure that they also act to \nsimilar standards of integrity and ethical behavior. The CLP corporate governance framework lays \ndown  procedures  applicable  to  enforcement  of  shareholder  rights,  activities  of  the  board  and \nboard  committees,  management  and  staff,  and  auditors.  Eight  board  committees  have  been \ncreated to oversee various aspects of the board\u2019s operations, including audit; remuneration; and \nsocial,  environmental,  and  ethics-related  issues.  In  addition,  the  CLP  Group  has  formulated  a \nnumber of policies including  a fair disclosure policy, guidelines on  related-party transactions, an \nanti-fraud  policy,  and  procurement  values  and  principles.  As  a  fully  owned  subsidiary,  GPEC  is \nalso obligated to adhere to the principles enunciated by the CLP Group. \n \nC. \n \n20.  GPEC\u2019s power plant at Paguthan is a critical source of power to the state of Gujarat and \naccounts  for  about  8%  of  the  state\u2019s  power  needs.  The  plant  has  shown  strong  operating \nperformance since inception and has consistently achieved a plant availability close to 90%, while \nkeeping  forced  outages  at  very  low  levels.  GPEC\u2019s  operations  and  maintenance  strategy  has \nfocused on maximizing plant availability, ensuring operational safety and optimizing maintenance \ncosts.  Critical  maintenance  activities  such  as  hot  gas  path  inspections  have  been  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  original  equipment  suppliers  on  a  regular  basis. \nGPEC  has  also  consistently  achieved  high  levels  of  plant  load  factors.  A  detailed  analysis  of \nGPEC is in Appendix 3. \n\nOperational Performance \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nProject Description \n\nA. \n \nThe Samana Wind Power Project is located at Samana Taluka, Jamnagar district, Gujarat, \n21. \nabout  7  km  from  Rajkot.  The  Saundatti  Wind  Power  Project  is  located  at  Saundatti  Taluka, \nBelgaum district, Karnataka state, and is about 85 km from Belgaum and about 80 km from Hubli. \nBoth sites are well connected by roads to a number of mid-sized cities in their respective states. \n \n22. \nThe Samana Wind Power Project involves the construction and operation of 100.8 MW of \nwind  power  generation  facilities.  The  Project  is  physically  a  part  of  a  larger  wind  energy  farm \ncurrently being developed by Enercon (India) Limited (EIL) for GPEC and other interested power \nproducers.  Upon  completion,  the  Samana  wind  farm  as  a  whole  will  have  450  wind  turbine \ngenerators (WTGs) with a combined power generation capacity of 360 MW (0.8 MW per WTG). \nOf the 450 WTGs, 126 WTGs will be owned by GPEC as a part of the Project while the remaining \n324 WTGs will be owned by other power producers. Power from each WTG will be transmitted at \n33kV to a power collection system at the Sadodar substation located inside the  wind farm.  The \nsubstation will be owned and operated by EIL and is proposed to have four 100 million volt-amp \n(MVA) transformers to step up the power from 33 kV to 220kV. \n \nThe Saundatti Wind Power Project involves the construction and operation of 82.4 MW of \n23. \nwind power generation facilities (103 units of 0.8 MW each). This project is also being developed \nby EIL exclusively for GPEC. Power generated at the wind farm will be pooled through a power \ncollection  system  and  fed  into  the  Karnataka  Power  Transmission  Corporation  Limited  (KPTCL) \nsubstation  located  near  Saundatti  town  on  the  southern  ridge  of  the  wind  farm.  The  substation \ncurrently has 2 X 20 MVA transformers to step up power from 33 kV to 110 kV. \n \n24. \nand will increase its renewable energy portfolio by almost one third. \n \nB. \n \n25.  EIL  has  received  the  requisite  permissions  from  Gujarat  Energy  Development  Agency \n(GEDA)  and  government  of  Karnataka  for  developing  wind  energy  farms  in  Samana  and \nSaundatti. Subsequently it approached GPEC with proposals to transfer the two projects to GPEC \nand  develop  them  on  a  turnkey  basis  covering  all  aspects  of  development  and  commissioning. \nGPEC  conducted  its  own  legal  and  technical  due  diligence  on  the  projects,  including  a  detailed \nwind  assessment  study  with  the  assistance  of  Hydro  Tasmania  Consulting.12  Further,  the \ncommercial and technical feasibility of each Project was evaluated by GPEC covering plant load \nfactor  projections,  grid  losses,  technology,  grid  availability,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \ncharges, capital cost, and state tariff policies. The proposals were negotiated between GPEC and \nEIL and eventually GPEC executed separate facilitation agreements with EIL for developing the \ntwo projects. The facilitation agreements are comprehensive in nature. Under these agreements, \nEIL  will  transfer  the  projects  to  GPEC  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  design,  development, \nconstruction,  and  commissioning;  (ii)  land  procurement/acquisition;  and  (iii)  all  regulatory  and \nstatutory  approvals.  The  contracts  are  fixed  price  turnkey  contracts  with  suitable  provisions  for \nrecovery of liquidated damages for delays in implementation. \n \n\nThe combined Project will be the largest wind project undertaken by the CLP Group to date \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n12  Hydro  Tasmania  is  a  government  business  enterprise  owned  by  the  state  of  Tasmania  in  Australia.  Hydro \nTasmania Consulting, an arm of Hydro Tasmania, draws on around 100 years of expertise of Hydro Tasmania in \nthe areas of renewable energy and power engineering.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n26.  EIL is a 56:44 joint venture between Enercon GmbH of Germany (the second largest wind \nenergy company in the world) and the Mehra group of Mumbai. EIL started commercial operations \nin  1995,  and  crossed  the  milestone  of  1,000  WTGs  and  500  MW  capacity  during  2004\u20132005. \nWorldwide, Enercon GmbH has already installed over 7,400 WTGs with an installed capacity of \n6,600 MW. EIL has strong financials, with 2006\u20132007 revenues exceeding Rs22 billion and a net \nworth of Rs4.7 billion. \n \n27.  Wind  power  generation  technology  is  well  established  and  as  such  the  Project  does  not \nface significant technological risks. EIL will employ for the Project E-53 WTGs, which are currently \nthe  most  advanced  wind  turbines  being  manufactured  by  EIL  in  India.  The  E-53  WTGs  have  a \nproven  track  record  and  are  being  used  in  a  Tata  Power  wind  energy  project  earlier  funded  by \nADB.  The  E-53s  are  upgraded  versions  of  the  already  established  E-48  WTGs  but  with  larger \nblade diameters.  Each  wind  turbine generator  will be  installed at a  hub height  of 74 meters (m) \nwith a rotor diameter of 53 m. The E-53 design also features a recently developed high-efficiency \nblade with root spoilers and winglet tips. This design enables more energy to be extracted from \nthe  same  swept  area  when  compared  with  a  conventional  blade  design  and  reduces  the  noise \nfrom the blade tips. Other features include the class S features to specifically cater to Indian wind \nconditions  (extreme  wind  velocity  of  57  meters  per  second  [m/s]  and  an  average  wind  speed \nvelocity equivalent to 7.5 m/s) and a gearbox-free design. \n \n28.  Wind data for both locations was initially provided by EIL based on raw data collected over \nabout  2  years.  This  data  was  reviewed  in  house  by  Roaring  40s  Renewable  Energy  Pte.  Ltd., \nwhich  is  a  joint  venture  between  the  CLP  Group  and  Hydro  Tasmania.  This  joint  venture  has \nextensive  experience  in  wind  assessment  and  construction  of  wind  farms  across  Australia,  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and India. Hydro Tasmania Consulting modeled 20-year synthesized \ndata resulting in the generation of long-term annual energy output estimates for both the sites.  \n \n29.  GPEC  has  also  signed  comprehensive  warranty  O&M  agreements  with  EIL  for  both  the \nprojects,  whose  scope  includes  repairs  and/or  replacement  of  defective  parts,  operations  and \nmaintenance  (scheduled  and  unscheduled)  and  assistance  in  manning  site  office  and  record \nmaintenance. The O&M contracts stipulate a fixed price payable to EIL per WTG (increasing over \nthe years) for an initial period of 10 years. The contract comes with an availability guarantee (97% \nfor the high-wind season and 95% for the low-wind season) and performance guarantees. GPEC \nwill take a comprehensive insurance cover during the operational phase of the Project.  \n \n30. \nThe  Samana  Project  started  in  July  2007  and  the  first  set  of  11  WTGs  will  be \ncommissioned by April 2008. The entire project is expected to be commissioned by January 2009. \nFor  the  Saundatti  Project,  delivery  of  the  WTGs  will  commence  in  a  phased  manner  starting \nMarch 2009 and the Project is expected to be fully commissioned by June 2009. \n \nC. \n \n31. \nThe Samana wind farm is already connected to the high-tension grid. Power generated by \nthe  various  WTGs  will  be  pooled  into  a  common  substation  located  at  Sadodar  within  the  wind \nfarm, then metered and fed into the Gujarat Electric Transmission Corporation (GETCO) grid for \nsale  to  GUVNL.  EIL  will  suitably  expand  the  Sadodar  substation  as  more  WTGs  come  into \noperation  at  the  site  and  EIL  will  be  responsible  for  the  substation\u2019s  O&M.  Power  from  the \nSaundatti wind farm will be pooled from the WTGs and evacuated through the KPTCL substation \nlocated near Saundatti town. GPEC had commissioned a study to review the adequacy of power \nevacuation infrastructure in Saundatti, which has reported adequate evacuation arrangements. \n \n32.  GPEC will sell its output from the Samana Project to GUVNL under a 20-year PPA in line \nwith  the  new  renewable  energy  policy  in  effect  in  the  state.  The  PPA  will  be  executed  prior  to \ncommissioning of the Project. The tariff has been fixed at Rs3.37 per kWh for the entire tenor of \n \n\nEvacuation and Selling Arrangements \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nthe PPA. Twenty-five percent of gross Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) revenues through \nthe sale of certified emission reductions (CERs) will be shared with GUVNL. GPEC has already \ninitiated  the  CDM  registration  process  for  this  Project  and  has  submitted  the  project  design \ndocument  (PDD)  for  the  first  phase  (comprising  63  WTGs)  to  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and \nForest,  Government  of  India,  which  is  the  designated  national  authority.  PDD  for  the  second \nphase will be prepared upon acquisition of land for the same. The model PPA is a \u201ctake-and-pay\u201d \ncontract,  which  grants  a  \u201cmust-run\u201d  status  to  the  Project.  It  provides  for  complete  offtake  with \nexplicit  clauses  providing  for  shutdowns  only  in  emergency  situations.  This  dilutes  any  risk  of \nshutdowns  as  a  result  of  capacity-requirements-based  back-down  situations.  With  the  Gujarat \nElectricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) stipulating a minimum renewable purchase obligation \n(RPO)  on  utilities  (currently  1%  of  total  purchase,  to  be  increased  to  2%  from  2010),  significant \nrenewable  generation  capacity  of  up  to  780  MW  will  require  to  be  set  up  in  the  state,  largely \nthrough the wind sector. The Samana Project is therefore assured of offtake by GUVNL, both as \nper the terms of the PPA as well as RPO obligations imposed by GERC. \n  \n33.  Output from the Saundatti Project will be sold under a 20-year PPA to be executed with one \nof the electricity distribution companies in the state. As per terms of the facilitation agreement with \nEIL, EIL is responsible for facilitating the execution of a PPA in the following order of preference: \nBangalore  Electricity  Supply  Company  (BESCOM),  Mangalore  Electricity  Supply  Company \n(MESCOM),  Hubli  Electricity  Supply  Company  (HESCOM),  Chamundeswari  Electricity  Supply \nCompany (CHESCOM), and Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (GESCOM). The model PPA \nhas tariff fixed at Rs3.40 for the first 10 years. Tariffs beyond the first 10 years will be determined \nby the regulator. The PPA does not provide for any CDM revenue-sharing arrangement with the \nofftaker and qualifies as a base load generating station that is not subject to merit order dispatch. \nThe PDD for CDM registration will be prepared in due course upon receipt of ownership of land. \nThe  KERC  has  determined  the  minimum  RPO  for  state  distribution  companies  at  10%,  out  of \nwhich about 7% can be met through wind generation.13 This translates to additional potential wind \ncapacity  in  the  state  of  about  800  MW  until  2012.  The  Saundatti  Project,  which  will  be \ncommissioned by mid-2009 will play a critical role in enabling the electricity distribution companies \nmeet their RPO requirements. \n \n34. \nKarnataka for meeting the respective states\u2019 renewable purchase obligations. \n \n\nTable  2  provides  the  incremental  wind  generation  capacities  required  in  Gujarat  and \n\nTable 2: Additional Wind Energy Capacity Required for Meeting Renewable Purchase \nObligations \n \n\n \n\n \n\nGujarat \n\n \n\nKarnataka \n\n \n\nFiscal Year \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n\nRPO \n(%) \n1 \n1 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n\nRPO \n(GWh) \n62.3 \n67.3 \n72.8 \n78.8 \n85.5 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAdditional \nCapacity required \n(MW) \n284 \n23 \n357 \n55 \n61 \n\nRPO \n(%) \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n7 \n\nRPO \n(GWh) \n40.0 \n42.6 \n45.8 \n49.5 \n53.5 \n\nAdditional \nCapacity \nrequired (MW) \n368 \n83 \n104 \n116 \n130 \n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt, RPO = renewable purchase obligation. \nSources:  Gujarat  Paguthan  Energy  Corporation  Private  Limited  and  Central  Electricity  Authority  Utilities \nConsumption Data 2007. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13 Source: Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited. \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\nD. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  because  it  is  unlikely  to \ncreate  any  significant  environmental  impact  during  construction  and  operation.  Comprehensive \nenvironmental  impact  studies  for  the  two  projects  were  completed  in  January  2008  in  line  with \nADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies for environmental category B projects. As per Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forest (MOEF), notification S.O. 1533 dated 14 September 2006, environmental \nclearance  is  not  required  for  the  proposed  capacity  of  the  wind  power  projects.  The  summary \ninitial environmental examination for the Project is in Appendix 4.  \n \n36. \nThe  perceptible  environmental  impacts  are  noise  and  visual  impacts,  but  both  are \nconsidered  to  be  insignificant  at  most  given  the  considerable  setback  of  turbines  to  the  nearest \nsettlements  and  the  landscape  values  of  the  site.  The  environmental  disturbance  normally \nassociated  with  construction  activities  (i.e.,  land  disturbance,  vegetation  clearance,  erosion  and \nsedimentation, construction noise and traffic, and waste generation) is considered temporary due \nto the limited extent and significance of consequences. The implementation of the environmental \nmanagement  plan  will  minimize  or  mitigate  these  impacts  that  will  be  continued  during  project \noperations, and will also include monitoring arrangements. \n \n37. \nThe Project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. Land to be acquired for \nthe  Project  is  located  on  government,  forest,  and  private  lands.  Sites  located  on  government  or \nforest  land  would  be  first  leased  by  the  government  to  EIL  which,  on  commissioning,  would  be \ntransferred to GPEC through a transfer lease agreement. For privately owned land, the land will \nbe  purchased  by  EIL  and  later  transferred  to  GPEC  after  legal  due  diligence  by  GPEC.  The \nprivate  land  will  be  acquired  through  private  negotiations  between  EIL  and  the  owners  on  a \nwilling-buyer-to-willing-seller basis. Erection of the WTGs will be on uninhabited land and will not \ncause displacement, affect any physical structures, or lead to the loss of livelihoods. The project \nwill  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  economic  development  through \nincreased power generation in the states of Gujarat and Karnataka. Other socioeconomic benefits \nof the Project will include limited employment to community members in the vicinity of the WTGs. \n \n38.  As the Project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples, an indigenous peoples\u2019 \nplan is not required. There are no indigenous peoples (scheduled tribes) living close to or within \nthe  sites  identified  for  the  two  projects.  The  Project  has  no  perceptible  impacts  on  distinct  tribal \ngroups  in  the  project  areas.  Since  the  forest  land  on  both  sites  is  degraded  forest  with  thorny \nbushes and shrubs, it hosts no forest-dependent peoples. \n \nE. \n \n\nDevelopment Impacts \n\n1. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\n \nThe  Project  aims  to  promote  sustainable  growth  in  India  through  contributions  toward \n39. \nachieving minimum share targets for renewable energy in the generation mix and toward India\u2019s \nPower  for  All  goal.  The  Project,  which  aims  to  construct  183.2  MW  of  wind  energy  generation \nfacilities, will be one of the largest such initiatives in the country. The Project will catalyze private \nsector investment in India\u2019s renewable energy sector, mitigate significant amount of greenhouse \ngas (GHG)  emissions and improve  the energy  security  of the country  by  developing indigenous \nenergy  sources.  It  will  help  reduce  the  current  energy  and  peak  power  shortages  in  the  Indian \nstates  of  Gujarat  and  Karnataka.  The  Project  is  part  of  a  unique  model  for  private  sector \nparticipation in renewable energy envisaging successful collaboration between a private turnkey \nproject  developer  and  a  strategic  investor.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n \n40. \nThe  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project  will  be  assessed  in  terms  of  private  sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good-Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations,14  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  of  the  multilateral  development \nbanks. The Project will lead to private sector development by introducing a new business model of \ncollaboration  between  a  private  turnkey  developer  and  a  strategic  investor.  Being  one  of  the \nlargest private sector wind operations in the country, the Project will have a demonstration effect \nfor future private sector investments in wind generation using this model. The Project is financially \nand economically sustainable and also plays a significant role in mitigating GHGs, thus leading to \nglobal environmental benefits. The Project\u2019s development effectiveness framework is provided in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\nLoan \n\nA. \n \n41. \nADB  will  provide  a  local  currency  loan  of  up  to  Rs4.45  billion  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  GPEC  without  a  government  guarantee.  Proceeds  from  the  loan  will  be  used  for \neligible expenditures for the Project. The proposed loan will have a maturity of up to 13 years \nfrom  the  date  of  first  disbursement,  with  an  availability  period  of  15  months  and  semiannual \nrepayments starting 3 months from scheduled project completion. The loan will carry an interest \nrate,  as  well  as  commitment  and  front-end  fees,  to  be  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  pricing  and  credit \nenhancement committee. \n \n42. \nThe  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement,  which  will  contain  terms  and \nconditions  standard  for  private  sector  loans  without  government  guarantees,  as  well  as \ncovenants relating to ADB\u2019s policies.15 The ADB loan will share common terms and conditions \nwith other lenders\u2019 loans as far as possible. The loan will be subject to conditions precedent to \nthe disbursement, including all necessary government, creditor, and shareholder approvals and \nconsents;  and  all  contractual  and  financial  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan \nagreement  will  include  (i)  appropriate  representations  and  warranties;  (ii)  covenants,  including \naffirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events of default. \n \n43. \nThe  proposed  loan  is  a  secured  corporate  loan,  and  ADB  will  rely  on  GPEC\u2019s  balance \nsheet, cash flows from GPEC\u2019s existing generating asset, and wind power generation revenues. \nAs  security,  ADB  will  require  the  creation  of  a  first  ranking  charge  over  all  movable  and \nimmovable assets of GPEC, which include the gas-based power plant as well as the wind power \nassets.  ADB  will  also  require  that  the  security  from  GPEC  be  created  and  perfected  as  a \ncondition precedent to drawdown or, for certain types of asset classes (e.g., immovable property \nand rights under contracts) as and when practicable during the term of the loan, having regard \nto  Indian  law  and  procedure  on  perfection  of  security  and  GPEC\u2019s  timetable  for  entry  into \nproject-related  contracts.  Lenders  will  also  require  the  establishment  of  a  trust  and  retention \naccount mechanism whereby all receipts of GPEC will be deposited and utilized only in a pre-\ndetermined  priority  of  utilization.  In addition,  a debt\u2013service  reserve  account  will be  created  in \nfavor  of  the  lenders,  which  will  be  funded  to  the  extent  of  prospective  6  months\u2019  debt  service \nobligations. All future financing by GPEC will be subject to corporate level covenants, namely a \ndebt\u2013equity ratio not to exceed 2.33:1 and a DSCR not below 1.3 times. \n                                                 \n14 Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation  Group. 2006.

Particularly  in  the  power  sector,  policy  dialogue  by  ADB\u2019s  South \nAsia Department has focused on (a) supporting sector reform and restructuring, \n(b)  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  clean  energy  development,  and  (c) \npromoting  balanced  physical  infrastructure  development.  The  proposed  ADB \nloan  is  in  line  with  this  strategy  and  dovetails  with  the  efforts  including  ongoing \ndialogues  with  the  Government  under  the  public  sector  operations.  The  Project \nwill  aid  in  meeting  the  significant  energy  and  power  shortages  in  the  states  of \nKarnataka  and  Gujarat. If  approved,  it  will  be the  largest  financing  by  ADB  of  a \nprivate sector renewable energy project. \n\nThe proposed loan is consistent with ADB\u2019s energy sector policy (footnote 11). It \nalso  forms  a  part  of  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  and  environment  program,  which  was \nlaunched  in  response  to  the  communiqu\u00e9  by  the  Group  of  8  at  the  Gleneagles \nSummit  in  July  2005.16  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  states  that  ADB  will  promote  the \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources in developing member countries, and \nthat  ADB  will  also  assist  in  implementing  such  projects,  preferably  through \nprivate sector involvement to ensure their sustainable long-term operations. The \nclean  energy  and  environment  program  includes  implementation  of  renewable \nenergy  investment  opportunities.  The  Project  may  also  benefit  from  assistance \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund  for  upfront  financing  of  future  revenues \nfrom CERs.  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  helps  increase  power  generation  from  renewable  energy \nsources in India. India has been trying to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels \nand to develop renewable energy sources, which are abundant in the country, to \nincrease  energy  security  and  promote  environmentally  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. The proposed ADB loan will assist in adding 12% more wind power \ngeneration  capacity  in  the  state  of  Gujarat,  9%  more  wind  power  generation \ncapacity  in  the  state  of  Karnataka  and  approximately  2.5%  in  the  country  as  a \nwhole. \n\nThe proposed loan will help GPEC and its parent, the CLP Group, to meet their \nstated  commitment  to  increase  the  share  of  clean  energy  in  their  generation \nportfolio.  With  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  the  CLP  Group  will  be  able  to \nincrease the share of wind in its generation portfolio to over 5%. The Project will \nalso  help  distribution  licensees  in  Gujarat  and  Karnataka  meet  their  renewable \npurchase obligations.  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  helps  improve  the  country\u2019s  environmental  standards  by \nreducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  Project  will  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions  by  over  400,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  per  year  and  by \napproximately 8 million tons of CO2 during the minimum project life of 20 years. \n\nThe  proposed  loan,  which  will  provide  long-term,  fixed-interest  rupee  financing, \nwill  offer  the  best  possible  solution  to  the  Borrower  under  current  market \ncircumstances.  The  Borrower  values  such  long-term,  fixed-interest  rupee \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 Group of 8. 2005. The Gleneagles Communiqu\u00e9.

As  all  of  GPEC\u2019s  revenues  are  in  Indian  rupees,  the  rupee  financing \nhelps avoid a currency mismatch between revenues and expenditures. The feed-\nin  tariff  for  wind  energy  projects  does  not  allow  financing  costs  to  be  passed \nthrough.  As  such,  the  long-term,  fixed-interest  rate  will  increase  stability  of  the \nProject\u2019s  financing  plan.  This  will  also  help  to  make  wind  energy  generation  a \n\u201cstand  alone\u201d  business,  thereby  encouraging  more  investments  by  Indian  and \nforeign utilities. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\n \n45. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  Combating  Money \nLaundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003)  were  explained  to  GPEC.  Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require \nGPEC  to  maintain and  comply  with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing  of  terrorism;  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The \nfinancing  documentation  between  ADB  and  GPEC  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\nVII. \n\nINVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n\n \n46. \nOnce approved, the proposed loan of up to Rs4.45 billion to GPEC will represent 2.6% of \nADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations\u2019 portfolio. The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, \nindustry, group, and single-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments.  \n \n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n\nConsistent  with \n\nthe  Agreement  Establishing \n\n \nthe \n47. \nGovernment  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to \nGPEC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB  will  enter  into \nsuitable  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the \nproposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank, \n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n48. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend

With  recent  continued  and  sustained  hikes  in  oil  and  gas  prices,  as  well  as  the \nexpected  shortages  of  fossil  fuels  in  the  future,  the  security  of  India\u2019s  energy  supply  is \ngenerating  increasing  concern.  The  environmental  concern  over  excess  use  of  fossil  fuels  is \nalso rising. In this context, India urgently needs to explore sustainable energy development, and \nthe Government has been working proactively to promote use of renewable energy sources. \n \n2. \nAmong  the  renewable  power  resources  available  in  India,  wind  energy  is  a  promising \nsource for further development. India has 45,000 megawatts (MW) of gross potential, assuming \n1% of land availability for wind power generation in the potential areas. Sites with annual mean \nwind  density  exceeding  200  watts  per  square  meter  are  considered  suitable  for  wind  power \nprojects, and 216 such sites have been identified in the country by the Center for Wind Energy \nTechnology  (C-WET).  The  states  with  the  largest  number  of  sites  include  Tamil  Nadu  (41), \nGujarat  (38),  Andhra  Pradesh  (32),  Maharashtra  (31)  and  Karnataka  (26).  However,  India\u2019s \ntechnical  potential  is  limited  to  only  about  13,000  MW,  assuming  20%  grid  penetration,  which \nwill rise with the augmentation of grid capacity in potential states. As of September 2007, India \nhad  installed  wind  power  capacity  of  over  7,700  MW,  ranking  the  country  fourth  in  the  world \nafter  Germany,  Spain,  and  the  United  States. While  the  10th  Five  Year  Plan  targeted  a  2,200 \nMW increase of installed wind power capacity, over 5,400 MW has been installed.1 The installed \nwind power capacity and gross potential in India by state is provided in Table A2. \n \n\nTable A2: Installed Wind Power Capacity and Potential in India by State \n(MW) \n\nGross Potential \n\nState \n\nAndhra Pradesh \nGujarat \nKarnataka \nKerala \nMadhya Pradesh \nMaharashtra \nRajasthan \nTamil Nadu \nWest Bengal \nOthers \n\nTotal \n\nAs of \n31 March 2005 \n120.5 \n253.5 \n410.8 \n2.0 \n28.9 \n456.2 \n284.8 \n2,034.9 \n1.1 \n1.6 \n3,594.3 \n\nAs of \n31 March 2006 \n121.0 \n338.1 \n584.6 \n2.0 \n40.3 \n1,001.3 \n358.1 \n2,892.5 \n1.1 \n1.6 \n5,340.6 \n\nAs of \n30 September 2007 \n121.0 \n828.0 \n903.0 \n2.0 \n71.0 \n1,620.5 \n494.0 \n3,662.5 \n1.6 \n1.6 \n7,705.2 \n\n8,275 \n9,675 \n6,620 \n875 \n5,500 \n3,650 \n1,700 \n5,400 \n3,050 \n450 \n45,195 \n\nMW = megawatt. \n Source: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \n \n3. \nBoth Gujarat and Karnataka are leading states in wind resources availability (with gross \npotential of 9,675 MW and 6,620 MW respectively), as well as in wind generation capacity (with \ninstallations of 828 MW and 903 MW respectively).

The  Government  created  the  Commission  for  Additional \nSources of Energy in 1981 and Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1982. The \nDepartment  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources  was  transformed  into  the  Ministry  of  Non-\nConventional Energy Sources (MNES) in 1992, and then was renamed the Ministry of New and \nRenewable  Energy  (MNRE)  in  2006.  The  National  Electricity  Policy,  issued  by  the  Ministry  of \nPower in 2005, contains a major thrust toward the development of renewable energy sources. \nMNRE  is  the  nodal  ministry  in  the  Government  for  all  matters  relating  to  new  and  renewable \nenergy.  Its  main  functions  include  (i)  policymaking  and  planning,  (ii)  program  formulation  and \ntechnology  development  and \nimplementation, \ncommercialization, (v) promotion of demonstration and pilot projects, and (vi) implementation of \nfiscal and financial incentives. \n \nThe MNES (now MNRE) established the Centre for Wind Energy Technology at Chennai \n5. \nas an autonomous research and development institution of the Government and as a technical \nfocal point for India\u2019s wind power development.  The center provides developers with technical \nservices, including wind resource assessment for project sites, testing and certification services \nfor equipment, and training and capacity-building services. \n \n6. \nTechnological  advancements  are  gradually  increasing  the  commercial  viability  of  wind \npower projects. The replacement of old 250-kilowatt wind turbines at a height of 30 meters (m) \nwith 1-MW units at 50 m height has made wind power more attractive as an investment. Higher \nwind  power  density  due  to  increased  height,  lower  installation  cost  per  MW,  and  less  land \nrequirement  make  a  case  for  choosing  higher  unit  size  of  wind  turbines.  India\u2019s  advantage  is \nthat wind turbines of 1 MW and above are being manufactured in the country. \n \n7. \nFiscal and financial incentives provided by the Government and the state governments \nhave traditionally driven the development of wind power projects in India. The incentives being \nprovided by the Government include (i) 80% accelerated depreciation of project costs for wind \npower  projects;  (ii)  concessions  or  full  exemption  on  customs  duties  of  certain  imported \ncomponents of wind turbines; (iii) tax holiday for a maximum of 10 consecutive years within 15 \nyears  of  commissioning,  which  is  available  for  infrastructure  projects;  and  (iv)  concessional \nloans  available  through  Government-owned  agencies,  including  Indian  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment  Agency  Limited,  Power  Finance  Corporation  Limited,  and  Rural  Electrification \nCorporation Limited.  \n \n8. \nRecently,  the  focus  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  renewable  energy  sector  has \nchanged  from  being  driven  by  supply  to  being  driven  by  demand.  The  Electricity  Act,  20032 \nrequires  all  state-level  energy  regulatory  commissions  to  ensure  that  electricity  distributors \nprocure a specified minimum percentage of power generation from renewable energy sources. \nThe midterm appraisal of the 10th Five Year Plan by Planning Commission (footnote 1) included \nthe following recommendations for the renewable energy sector: \n \n                                                 \n2  Section  86  of  the  Electricity  Act,  2003  states:  \u201cThe  State  Commission  shall  discharge  the  following  functions, \nnamely:\u2026(e)  promote  cogeneration  and  generation  of  electricity  from  renewable  sources  of  energy  by  providing \nsuitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase \nof  electricity  from  such  sources,  a  percentage  of  the  total  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  area  of  a  distribution \nlicense;\u2026\u201d \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n19\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nswitch incentives and support from the supply-driven programs to demand-driven \nprograms and technologies; \nexplore  alternative  subsidy  structures  that  encourage  utilities  to  integrate  wind, \nsmall hydroelectric, cogeneration, etc., into their systems; \nphase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated; \nstate electricity regulatory commissions should mandate the purchase of energy \nfrom renewable sources, as per the provisions of the Electricity Act; and \nimprove  coordination  and  synergize  the  programs  of  MNES  (currently  MNRE) \nwith similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \n\nWind Power in Gujarat \n\n \nC. \n \n9. \nGujarat has a long coastline and certain inland areas that have significant potential for \nwind  energy  generation.  As  of  30  September,  2007,  the  total  installed  wind  power  capacity  in \nthe  state  of Gujarat  was  828  MW  against  a  total  gross  potential  of  9,675  MW  and  a  technical \npotential  of  1,780  MW.  Significant  potential  therefore  exists  for  further  wind  generation  in  the \nstate. About 50 sites have been declared to have potential as wind farms on the basis of long-\nterm  data  on  wind  speeds  collected  under  the  aegis  of  MNRE.  The  first  demonstration  wind \nfarm was set up in the state in 1986 at the Okha coast, followed by a few more wind farms with \na combined capacity of about 16 MW. The satisfactory performance of these wind farms led to \nthe announcement of an incentive scheme in 1993, as per which the sector was opened up for \nprivate sector participation. Under this scheme, wind farm capacity of about 150 MW more was \nset up during 1993\u20131998. In 2002, the state government declared a new wind power generation \npolicy.  However,  the  tariff  envisaged  under  this  policy  (Rs2.60  per  kWh)  was  not  considered \nenough of an incentive to attract any significant investment in this sector. \n\n \nIn  August  2006,  the  GERC  announced  an  order  to  bring  into  effect  a  new  renewable \n\n10. \nenergy policy.3 This policy covers wind energy, and envisages the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\na full-project life PPA with a term of 20 years would be signed between GUVNL \nor other distribution licenses and the power generator prior to commissioning of \nthe plant; \na fixed, levelized tariff of Rs3.37 per kWh for the entire tenor of the PPA; \n25% of CDM benefits to be shared with GUVNL; \nPPA  to  provide  for  a  \u201cmust-run\u201d  status  covering  the  entire  offtake  of  the  wind \nfarms, thus envisaging shutdowns only under explicit emergency situations; \na  minimum  percentage  of  GUVNL\u2019s  total  energy  purchase  (known  as  the \nrenewable purchase obligation, RPO) has to be from renewable energy sources. \nThe  RPO  has  been  set  at  1%  for  FY2009,  to  be  increased  to  2%  during            \nFY2010\u2013FY2012.  \n\n \nIn June 2007, the government of Gujarat released a new Wind Power Policy\u201420074 to \n11. \naccelerate investment in the sector. The policy will remain in effect until June 2012, and all wind \nturbine  generators  installed  and  commissioned  before  that  date  would  be  eligible  for  various \nincentives  declared  under  the  policy.  The  policy  allows  (i)  captive  use  and  third-party  sales  of \npower; (ii) 4% of energy fed into the grid as wheeling charges; (iii) exemption from payment of \n\n                                                 \n3 GERC. 2006.

Gandhinagar. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n    Appendix 2 \n\nWind Power in Karnataka \n\nelectricity  duty,  except  for  third  party  sales;  and  (iv)  a  tariff  of  Rs3.37 per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh). \nUnder the policy, the Gujarat Electricity Development Agency is the focal point for implementing \nthe policy. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nKarnataka  is  one  of  the  leading  states  in  wind  energy  generation  in  India  with  a  gross \npotential  of  about  6,600  MW.  As  of  30  September  2007,  Karnataka  had  an  installed  wind \ngeneration capacity of 903 MW. Significant potential therefore exists for further wind generation \nin  the  state.  The  Karnataka  Renewable  Energy  Development  Limited  (KREDL)  is  the  nodal \nagency  responsible  for  promoting  renewable  energy  generation  in  the  state.  KREDL  also \noperates as the primary agency for promoting wind power in the state. \n \n13. \nThe KERC has passed various regulations from time to time to encourage wind power \ngeneration  in  the  state.  In  accordance  with  the  tariff  policies  issued  by  the  Government,  the \nKERC  issued  the  Power  Procurement  from  Renewable  Sources  by  Distribution  Licensees \nRegulations dated 27 September 2004 (the RPO regulations). Under the RPO regulations, each \nof the four distribution licensees (now five) in the state must purchase a minimum of 5% and a \nmaximum  of  10%  of  the  total  electricity  consumption  in  its  area  of  supply  from  renewable \nsources.  KERC  had  reserved  the  right  to  review  the  RPO  policy  every  3  years.  With  the  first     \n3-year  period  expiring  in  October  2007,  the  government  of  Karnataka  concluded  that  the \nmaximum  limit  prescribed  by  the  KERC  might  be  an  impediment  to  the  development  of \nrenewable  energy  projects.  The  government  of  Karnataka  has  therefore,  by  an  order  dated  2 \nMarch 2007, opined that the RPO be enhanced to 20% in light of the fact that the maximum limit \nprescribed by the RPO regulations has already been achieved or will be achieved shortly. The \nKERC has since heard the order in October 2007 and an order to this effect is awaited. \n \n14. \nKERC,  by  an  order  in  January  2005,  stipulated  a  tariff  of  Rs3.40  per  kWh  without  any \nescalation  for  the  first  10  years  of  operations  for  wind  power  projects  in  the  state.  In  August \n2005, the KERC also approved a standard PPA to be executed between the generator and the \ndistribution licensee. The salient features of the model PPA include: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\na term of 20 years; \nfixed,  non-escalable  tariff  of  Rs3.40  per  kWh  for  the  first  10  years  of  the  PPA; \ntariff beyond the first 10 years to be determined by KERC; \nno sharing of CDM benefits with distribution licensees; and \n\u201ctake-and-pay\u201d  provision,  allowing  for  a  \u201cmust-run\u201d  status  and  qualification  as  a \nbase load generating station that is not subject to merit-order dispatch. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n21\n\nGUJARAT PAGUTHAN ENERGY CORPORATION PRIVATE LIMITED \n \n\nOverview \n\nOwnership, Management, and Corporate Governance \n\nA. \n \nGujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation (GPEC) was set up in 1992 under the name of \n1. \nGujarat  Torrent  Energy  Corporation  Limited  as  a  joint  venture  between  the  Torrent  Group  of \nIndia  (46%),  Powergen  of  UK  (28%),  the  government  of  Gujarat  (12%),  and  Siemens  AG \n(14%). In 2002, Powergen purchased the stakes of the other three entities in the joint venture. \nIn June 2003, Powergen divested its entire equity stake in favor of the CLP Group. GPEC is a \ncompany  that  owns  and  operates  a  single  asset:  a  655  megawatt  (MW)  gas-fired  combined-\ncycle power plant at Paguthan, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The combined-cycle power plant has \nbeen  operational  since  1997  and  sells  its  entire  electrical  output  to  the  Gujarat  Urja  Vikas \nNigam  Limited  (GUVNL)  under  a  long-term  PPA,  which  in  turn  sells  it  to  four  distribution \ncompanies  in  Gujarat.  Along  with  the  acquisition  of  GPEC,  the  CLP  Group  also  acquired  the \nownership  of  Powergen  India  Pvt.  Ltd.  (now  renamed  CLP  Power  India  Private  Limited,  or \nCPIPL), the operations and maintenance (O&M) arm of Powergen.  \n  \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  CLP  Group  has  100%  ownership  of  GPEC  through  an  offshore  holding  company \nstructure. GPEC has 728 million fully paid-up shares, of which 99.99% are held by CLP Power \n(GPEC) Limited, a Mauritius entity. The remaining 0.01% of GPEC shares are held by CPIPL, \nwhich  is  also  100%  owned  by  the  CLP  Group.  CPIPL  has  been  converted  into  the  business \ndevelopment  arm  of  the  CLP  Group  in  India  besides  continuing  to  play  the  role  of  the  O&M \noperator for the Paguthan plant. Given that both GPEC and CPIPL are 100% owned by the CLP \nGroup,  it  is  likely  that  these  two  entities  will  be  merged  in  the  near  future,  subject  to  required \nlender and statutory approvals. \n \nThe CLP Group, founded in 1901 as China Light and Power Company Limited in Hong \n3. \nKong, China, is one of the leading investor-owned power utilities in Asia. It is a conglomerate of \ncompanies  with  a  portfolio  of  over  30  generation  assets  and  retail  businesses  in  different \ncountries  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  The  group  has  investments  in  over  30,000  MW  gross \ngeneration  assets.  The  group  holding  company,  CLP  Holdings  Limited  (rated  A  [negative \ncreditwatch]/A-1[negative  creditwatch]  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s/Moody\u2019s),  is  listed  on  the  Hong \nKong  Stock  Exchange  and  had  a  market  capitalization  of  approximately  $19  billion  as  of  31 \nJanuary 2008. The Group registered total revenues of $5.8 billion in 2006 and earnings of $1.3 \nbillion.  In  Hong  Kong,  China,  CLP  operates  a  vertically  integrated  electricity  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  business,  with  an  installed  capacity  of  6,908  MW  and  a \ntransmission capacity of 12,000 kilometers. CLP supplies electricity to approximately 80% of the \npopulation in Hong Kong, China. The utility is operated by CLP Power Hong Kong Limited under \na regulatory regime created through a scheme of control agreement (SOC) with the government \nand  accounts  for  over  80%  of  CLP  Holdings\u2019  operating  cash  flow.  There  has  been  a  recent \nchange  in  the  regulatory  arrangements  under  the  SOC,  which  envisages  a  lower  permitted \nreturn  to  the  utility,  which  in  turn  could  limit  its  ability  to  raise  debt  financing  and  affect  its \ncommitment  to  provide  cleaner  and  stable  power  to  Hong  Kong,  China.  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s \nand  Moody\u2019s  have  therefore  placed  CLP  Holding\u2019s  credit  rating  on  negative  creditwatch  for  a \npotential downgrade.  \n \nGPEC  is  CLP\u2019s  first  investment  in  India.  In  future,  CLP  proposes  using  GPEC  as  its \n4. \ninvestment  vehicle  for all  of its  wholly  owned  projects in  India.  In  addition  to  GPEC,  CLP  also \nhas a presence in India through Roaring 40s, a joint venture between the CLP Group and Hydro \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTasmania, which has recently financed a 50.4 MW wind farm in the state of Maharashtra. GPEC \nis  strategically  important  to  the  CLP  Group  and  it  derives  strong  management,  technical,  and \nfinancial  support  from  its  parent.  GPEC\u2019s  top  management  is  nominated  by  CLP\u2019s  board  and \nGPEC\u2019s  managing  director  is  a  part  of  the  CLP  group\u2019s  senior  management  team.  GPEC  is \nmanaged  by  nine  directors  on  its  board,  of  which  seven  represent  the  CLP  Group  and  two \nrepresent  local  financial  institutions.  Mr.  Rajiv  Mishra,  the  managing  director  of  the  company, \nhandles the day-to-day management of GPEC under the supervision and control of the board of \ndirectors. As of 30 June 2007, the company had 119 employees.  \n \n5. \nThe CLP Group has a well-established code on corporate governance and policies. The \ncode  applies  to  directors,  officers  and  employees  of  CLP  Holdings,  its  wholly  owned \nsubsidiaries,  and  joint  ventures  or  companies  in  which  CLP  holds  a  controlling  interest.  In  the \ncase of joint ventures or companies in which CLP does not hold a controlling interest, the CLP \nrepresentatives concerned are expected to act in accordance with the code themselves and to \ndo everything possible to influence those with whom they are working to ensure that they also \nact  to  similar  standards  of  integrity  and  ethical  behavior.  The  CLP  corporate  governance \nframework  lays  down  procedures  applicable  to  enforcement  of  shareholder  rights,  activities  of \nthe board and board committees, management and staff, and auditors. Eight board committees \nhave  been  created  to  oversee  various  aspects  of  the  board\u2019s  operations,  including  audit, \nremuneration, social, environmental, and ethics-related issues. In addition, the CLP Group has \nformulated  a  number  of  policies  including  a  fair  disclosure  policy,  guidelines  on  related-party \ntransactions,  an  anti-fraud  policy,  and  procurement  values  and  principles.  As  a  fully  owned \nsubsidiary of the CLP Group, GPEC is also obligated to adhere to the principles enunciated by \nthe CLP Group. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  Paguthan  plant  is  located  about  10  kilometers  from  Bharuch  in  Gujarat  state.  The \npower plant consists of 3 Siemens V94.2 gas turbines, 3 heat recovery steam generators, and \none  steam  turbine  generator.  The  power  is  evacuated  to  the  Gujarat  Electricity  Transmission \nCompany Limited (GETCO) substations through a switchyard owned by GPEC. The power plant \nhas shown a strong operating performance since inception and has consistently achieved plant \navailability  exceeding  or  close  to  90%,  while  keeping  forced  outages  at  extremely  low  levels. \nThe power plant is a critical source of power for the state of Gujarat and accounts for about 8% \nof the state\u2019s total power needs. GPEC\u2019s operations and maintenance strategy has focused on \nmaximizing  plant  availability,  ensuring  operational  safety,  and  optimizing  maintenance  costs. \nCritical maintenance activities such as hot gas path inspections have been regularly carried out \nin accordance with recommendations of the equipment suppliers.  \n \n7. \nGPEC  adopts  the  CLP  Group\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies  and  has \nestablished and efficiently implemented its safety, health, and environment (SHE) policy through \na system and procedures based on international best practices. In addition, GPEC also initiates \nand implements community health and education development projects in consultation with the \nbeneficiary  communities.  GPEC\u2019s  SHE  performance  is  exemplary  considering  its  ISO  14001 \ncertification  (since  1999),  several  awards  related  to  SHE  received  over  the  years,  accidental \nrates  below  the  industry  norm,  full  compliance  with  all  applicable  national  SHE  regulations, \neffective waste management, well-established SHE management systems and procedures, staff \ntraining  on  a  continuing  basis,  and  staff  participation  in  the  SHE  management.  There  are  no \noutstanding  issues  related  to  resettlement  and  there  are  no  tribal  communities  living  in  the \nvicinity of the power plant area. \n \n\nOperational Performance \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23\n\nGPEC  is  conscious  of  its  social  responsibility  toward  the  communities  within  which  it \n8. \noperates.  In  September  2000,  GPEC,  under  its  corporate  social  responsibility  initiative, \nestablished  The  Paguthan  Power  Plant  Social  Development  Trust  with  the  aim  of  upgrading, \nstrengthening, and empowering the rural communities surrounding the plant. The trust takes up \nactivities  that  benefit  the  community  as  a  whole,  and  it  focuses  on  education,  health,  and \nenvironmental awareness programs covering 10 surrounding villages. Some of these activities \nare now extended to major parts of the Bharuch district. The trust's development programs are \nimplemented  with  the  participation  and  contribution  of  communities  and  stakeholders  such  as \nthe Government, donor agencies, other voluntary organizations, and experts. \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nGujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation Private Limited (GPEC) has executed a contract \n1. \nwith Enercon (India) Limited (EIL), a leading wind turbine manufacturer in India, to develop the \n100.8  MW  Samana  and  82.4  MW  Saundatti  wind  farm  projects  and  its  facilities  on  a  turnkey \nbasis. The Samana and Saundatti wind farms are expected to be completed by January 2009 \nand June 2009, respectively. \n \n2. \nThis  summary  of  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  is  based  on  comprehensive \nenvironmental  impact  study  reports1  for  Samana  and  Saundatti  wind  energy  projects  and  has \nbeen prepared for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in line with its environmental and social \nsafeguards policies and information disclosure requirements for category B projects. Under the \nMinistry  of  Environment  and  Forest  (MOEF)  Notification  S.O.  1533  dated  14  September  2006 \nenvironmental  clearance  is  not  required  for  this  proposed  capacity  of  wind  power  project  as \nsuch projects in India are categorized as green projects.  \n \nB. \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n1. \n\nProject Scope \n\n \n3. \nThe  Project  involves  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  Samana  and \nSaundatti  wind  power  generation  facilities.

(GETCO)  substation  through  a  220  kV  line.  At  Saundatti,  the  power \ngenerated will be evacuated by substation to be constructed by EIL near Goravanakolla village \non the south ridge of the project site. Each wind farm development will include the following: \n \n\n(i)  construction of an unpaved access road from the highway to the wind farm, \n(ii)  construction  of  internal  service  roads  branching  out  from  the  main  access  road  to \n\nindividual wind turbine generators (WTGs), \n\n(iii) erection of WTG towers for Samana and Saundatti, \n(iv) construction of substations at Samana and Saundatti, and \n(v)  installation of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to serve all \nthe  proposed  WTGs  per  wind  farm.  The  SCADA  system  and  the  substation  will  be \noperated and maintained by EIL for GPEC. \n\n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nProject Location and Topography \n\n \nThe Samana wind farm is located in Samana Taluka, 72 km from Jamnagar in Gujarat. \n6. \nThe nearest airport is about 82 km from the proposed project site. The project site is 10 km from \nthe National Highway (NH-8B) connecting Jamnagar to Rajkot. The site is located on a long and \nhilly ridge 150\u2013215 meters above mean sea level. The area is dry, barren, and uninhabited with \nmany rock outcrops. The soil is poor, mainly sand and silts, and thus has no agricultural value. \nThe area has no natural water sources, and can sustain only desert thorny bushes and shrubs.  \n \n7. \nThe Saundatti wind farm is located near Saundatti Taluka, about 80 km from Belgaum in \nKarnataka. The nearest airport is 85 km from the proposed project site. The site is located on a \nlong and low hill ridge with heights varying from 210 to 240 meters above mean sea level. The \narea is barren and uninhabited with many rock outcrops. Soil is poor, yellow soil with gravel, and \nthus  has  no  agricultural  value.  The  area  has  no  known  historical  or  cultural  sites.  The  area \ncovers  both  forest  land  and  privately  owned  land,  although  the  land  has  no  agricultural  value \nand is not inhabited. \n \n\n2. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n \n\n8. \nThe  Samana  wind  farm  is  in  the  Saurashtra  basin,  Gujarat,  which  consists  of  mostly \nMesozoic  and  Cenozoic  rocks.  The  area  has  no  known  commercial  deposits  of  mineral \nresources and supports only rock quarrying. The wind farm and its surrounding areas below the \nhill  ridge  are  comprised  of  arid  land  with  annual  rainfall  of  579  mm.  The  recorded  relative \nhumidity varies between a maximum of 75.4% and a minimum of 28.2%. The predominant wind \ndirections during the study period were from the east, northeast, and east-northeast, accounting \nfor about 45% of the total time with calm wind speed less than 2.0 m/sec for about 24.5% of the \ntime.  The  recorded  maximum  and  minimum  wind  speeds  were  2.5  m/sec  and  0.2  m/sec.  Air \ntemperatures  range  from  12.6oC  to  30.5oC.2  The  area  has  poor  soil  with  high  sand  and  silt \ncontent (sand 31%\u201340% and silt 49%\u201358%). There are no natural water resources in the wind \nfarm  area.  However,  the  surrounding  areas  below  the  wind  farm  have  some  surface  and \n\n                                                 \n2  Meteorological  station  was  established  at  proposed  project  site  at  Kalyanpur  during  December  2007  to  record \nvarious meteorological parameters such as wind pattern (hourly basis), temperature variation, and relative humidity. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\ngroundwater resources.  \n \n9. \nThe  existing  ambient  air  quality  status  has  been  monitored  at  six  locations  for \nsuspended particulate matter (SPM), respirable particulate matter (RPM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), \nnitrogen  oxides  (NOx),  and  carbon  monoxide  (CO).  Results  show  that  all  the  parameters \nmonitored  are  well  within  the  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  (NAAQS)  for  residential \nand rural areas.3 Noise level monitoring was carried out at six locations and the results showed \nthat  all  monitored  noise  levels  at  all  locations  were  found  to  be  within  the  prescribed  limit  of \nNAAQS in respect of noise. \n  \n10. \nThe Saundatti wind farm is in Belgaum district, which is rich in mineral resources such \nas iron, manganese, bauxite, clay, limestone, sand, building stones, etc. The wind farm area is \nbarren  land  with  no  significant  vegetation  and  is  characterized  by  its  poor  yellowish  soil  with \nembedded  rocks  and  gravels.  At  the  district  level,  the  climate  is  tropical  with  air  temperatures \nvarying from 11oC to 38oC and an average total rainfall of 1,476 millimeters. However, the wind \nfarm  area  is  on  the  dry  side  of  Belgaum  district  with  low  rainfall.  As  the  wind  farm  is  on  hilly \nterrain,  it  has  no  natural  surface  water  resources.  However,  the  surrounding  areas  below  the \nwind farm have some surface and groundwater resources. \n \n11. \nThe  predominant  wind  directions  during  the  study  period  were  from  the  west,  south-\nwest,  south-southwest,  and  west-southwest,  accounting  for  about  71.4%  of  the  total  time  with \ncalm  wind  more  than  2.0  m/sec  for  about  2.8%  of  the  time.  The  recorded  maximum  and \nminimum  wind  speeds  were  3.0  and  0.2  m/sec.  Air  temperature  varies  between  minimum  of \n14.0oC  and  a  maximum  31.2oC.4  The  existing  ambient  air  quality  (AAQ)  status  has  been \nmonitored  at  five  locations  for  SPM,  RPM,  SO2,  NOx  and  CO.  Results  showed  that  all  the \nparameters  monitored  are  well  within  the  NAAQS  for  residential  and  rural  areas.  Noise  level \nmonitoring  was  carried  out  at  five  locations  and  the  results  showed  that  all  monitored  noise \nlevels at all locations were found to be within the prescribed NAAQS. \n \n\n3. \n\nBiological Environment \n\n \nThe  Samana  wind  farm  area  is  poor  in  biological  resources.  The  areas  classified  as \n12. \nforest land in the surrounding areas immediately below the hill ridge are covered with degraded \nforest, thorny bushes, and shrubs. No large trees are visible apart from trees planted in villages \nin the surrounding areas. There are no wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests, or bird sanctuaries \nwithin the vicinity of the wind farm area.  \n \n13. \nThe  vegetation  of  Belgaum  district  is  of  two  types.  The  moist  type  occurs  in  the \nsouthwestern portion where the district touches the crest line of the Western Ghats. The second \nis  the  dry  type  found  towards  the  east  of  Belgaum  city  and  stretches  from  the  northern  areas \naround Athani, Chikodi, and Gokak right down to Sampagaon and Saundatti in the south. The \nmoist  vegetation  is  sustained  by  heavy  seasonal  precipitation  from  the  southwest  monsoon, \nwhich is active from June to October. There are no wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests, or bird \nsanctuaries within the immediate vicinity of the study area. \n \nAccording to the Zoological Survey of India, there is no specific domestic migration path \n14. \nof birds in Gujarat. The Khijadia bird sanctuary is 83 km from the proposed Samana wind farm \n\n                                                 \n3 The ambient air quality results also meet the World Bank standards for ambient air emissions. \n4  Meteorological  station  was  established  at  proposed  project  site  at  Saundatti  in  January  2008  to  record  various \n\nmeteorological parameters such as wind pattern (hourly basis), temperature variation and relative humidity. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27\n\nsite. \n \n\n4. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment \n\n \nHuman  resettlements  are  found  only  in  the  surrounding  areas  below  the  hilly  range \n15. \nwhere the wind farms will be located. There are 30 and 18 villages found in and around Samana \nand  Saundatti  project  sites,  respectively.  In  Samana,  most  of  the  population  is  dependent  on \nraising groundnuts, cotton, and livestock. In Saundatti, most of the total population depends on \nagriculture and raising livestock.  \n \n16. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  total  land  to  be  acquired  for  the  Samana \nProject will be about 234 acres. The land will be acquired in about 126 locations, of which 63 \nlocations  are  degraded  forest  land  and  the  balance  63  locations  will  be  predominantly \ngovernment land. Private land, if required for setting WTGs, will be acquired on willing-buyer-to-\nwilling-seller basis through negotiations between the owners and EIL. As the private land is not \ninhabited and not used for economic and social activities, its use for the erection of WTG towers \nwill not create adverse social impacts or economic losses. \n \n17. \nThe  total  land  to  be  acquired  for  the  Saundatti  Project  will  be  about  135  acres.  Of  the \n103 WTGs under the Saundatti Project, 64 WTGs are on forest land and 39 WTGs on private \nland. EIL will seek approval from the government of Karnataka under the Forest Conservation \nAct 1980 to use the required forest land under a lease agreement. The use of degraded forest \nland will not restrict access to forest resources, if any, of any communities living in the vicinity of \nthe wind farm area. Private lands will be acquired through private negotiations between EIL and \nthe owners based on willing-buyer-to-willing-seller basis. If negotiations with any particular land \nowners are not successful, alternative locations will be considered.  \n \n18. \nIndigenous Peoples. There are no indigenous peoples (scheduled tribes) living close to \nor within the sites identified for the Samana and Saundatti wind farms. No restrictions in access \nwill be imposed on degraded forest land. The sites are vacant, and there are no archeological, \nhistorical, or religious sites in the project areas. \n \nD. \n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nImpacts During Construction \n\n \nThe  construction  of  the  two  wind  farms  involve  only  minor  civil,  mechanical,  and \n19. \nelectrical  works  taking  place  on  several  small  areas  scattered  over  a  wide  area.  The \nconstruction  activities,  particularly  road  construction,  will  create  some  small  and  transient \nenvironmental disturbances such as noise, gaseous emissions, and dust from trucks and heavy \nequipment.  No  groundwater  will  be  tapped  for  domestic  and  construction  work.  The  water \nrequired  for  construction  will  be  purchased  from  municipal  sources  and  the  reverse  osmosis \nplant  at  the  EIL  concrete  tower  fabrication  (CTF)  factory  in  Sadodar.  Solid  waste  generated \nduring  road  construction  and  excavation  will  be  used  for  embankment  of  the  road  and  minor \nleveling  of  site  during  site  restoration  after  construction.  However,  these  environmental \ndisturbances will not create significant social or ecological impacts. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpacts During Operation \n\n \n20. \nDuring operation, the WTGs do not generate gaseous and dust emissions. Therefore, air \npollution  is  not  an  issue.  The  WTG  towers  erected  thus  far  have  not  created  adverse  visual \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nimpacts  since  the  hill  ridge  on  which  the  wind  farms  are  located  is  not  known  for  its  natural \nbeauty.  Noise  contribution  to  background  noise  will  be  the  bare  minimum,  and  will  not  have \nsignificant impact on either surrounding ambient noise quality or ecology. The wind turbines will \nalso not endanger migratory birds or bats as there are few in the wind farm areas. The turbine \ndesign minimizes flickering effects of turbine rotation. \n \n21. \nTransformers  used  at  each  WTG  tower  and  the  substation  will  be  of  forced-oil  and \nforced air cool design, which do not use polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). EIL will strictly adhere \nto regulations regarding air traffic and safety relevant to tall WTG towers. As per air navigational \nmarking  regulations,  the  upper  section  of  the  towers  and  turbine  blades  are  marked  with  red \nbands of a specific width for visibility. Blinking lights have been provided as per the navigational \nmarking regulations for visibility and clear identification at night. Hence, no impact is expected \non air traffic or safety. The region in which the wind farms are located has experienced seismic \ntremors ranging from 2.0 to 6.8 Richter scale. Therefore, the WTGs and towers as well as other \nbuildings  will  be  designed  with  appropriate  safety  factors  to  withstand  the  lateral  ground \nmovement caused by seismic shocks.  \n \n22. \nBoth direct and indirect temporary employment, for both casual and skilled labor, will be \ngenerated  during  construction  period.  The  existing  culture  and  health  of  the  local  populations \nwill not be affected as the construction period will be very short. \n \nE. \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\n1. \n\nOrganizational Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n \n23. \nAs  EIL  is  responsible  for  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  WTGs, \nsubstation  and  SCADA  system,  it  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring  of  the  Project.  GPEC  will  ensure  that  EIL  will  comply  with  all  regulations  and \nconditions  for  the  various  operating  permits.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \npresents  the  potential  impacts,  the  corresponding  mitigating  measures,  timeframe  and  the \nresponsible parties to implement the EMP. \n \nF. \n \n24. \nFormal consultation sessions have been held by GPEC and were attended by selected \nstakeholders,  including  representatives  from  local  gram  panchayats  (mostly  village  heads, \nsarpanches), local residents, and representatives of equipment suppliers to solicit their views on \nthe  Project  and  its  environmental  and  social  aspects.  EIL  has  conducted  many  awareness \ncamps  on  the  wind  energy  projects  covering  various  settlements  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project \narea  to  inform  local  communities  about  the  wind  energy  project.  Local  communities  have \ndemonstrated good understanding of the nature and scope of wind energy projects. They have \nbeen assured that the wind farms would have no significant environmental and social impacts. \nHowever, they hoped the wind farm would create economic opportunities for the communities, \nand  that  the  project  sponsor  would provide  assistance  in community  development,  particularly \ndrinking water, health, and education.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29\n\nFindings and Recommendations  \n\nG. \n \n25. \nThe IEE findings lead to the conclusion that the Project, being a wind energy project on \nmarginal land with no economic and ecological value, is unlikely to cause any significant, lasting \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts.  The  perceptible  environmental  impacts  are  noise  and  visual \nimpacts,  but  both  are  considered  to  be  moderate  at  most  given  the  considerable  setback  of \nturbines  to  the  nearest  settlements  and  the  landscape  values  of  the  site.  The  environmental \ndisturbance normally associated with construction activities will be minimized through an EMP, \nimplementation  of  which  will  continue  during  project  operation  and  which  includes  monitoring \narrangements. \n \nH. \n \n26. \nIt is concluded that the IEE is adequate to justify environmental and social clearance of \nthe Project. There is no need for further analysis and the environmental and social assessment \nof the Project is considered complete. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLand use outside project site  Restriction on construction related activities. \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Issue \n\nConstruction vehicle on \nunpaved roads \n\nTraffic control and safety \n\nMaterial spill \n \n\nStorage of construction \nmaterials \n\nSoil erosion \n\nBlockage and change in \ndrainage pattern \n\nNoise from construction \nrelated equipment \n\n \n\n3\n0\n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nTable A4.2: Environmental Management Plan \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nSprinkling of water to control fugitive dust emissions. \n\nDrivers to be trained to park vehicle safely and retain the key \nduring non-use of vehicle. \nVehicle used for delivery of materials to be well maintained and \napproved by the authority concerned. \nTemporary traffic control during transportation of wind turbines, \nand construction of roads, etc. \nIdling of vehicle to be avoided, especially near habitation. \n\nDelivery vehicles and/or trucks to be covered to avoid spillage. \n\nStore construction materials containing fine particles in an \nenclosure such that sediment-laden water does not drain into \nnearby water drains. \nStabilize slopes on road or elsewhere any embankments \n(through measures such as re-applying the top soil removed \nduring construction to retain spores of grass and shrub species) \nto control sedimentation, erosion, and water pollution.
