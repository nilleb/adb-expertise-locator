THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Regional Development Bank (RDB),1 to be guaranteed by the Democratic Socialist Republic \nof Sri Lanka, for the Strengthening the Regional Development Bank Project. The report also \ndescribes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction for the Enhancing Rural Micro and Small-Sized Enterprise Finance, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  Research from 2017 confirms earlier findings that limited access to finance is a key barrier \nfor entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka.2 One of the government\u2019s key policy tools to address this challenge \nis through RDB, whose mission is to strengthen the living standards of the rural population by \nproviding affordable and accessible credit facilities. By statute, RDB is wholly owned by the \ngovernment and other state-owned banks.3 The project would provide long-term financing that \nwould directly fund $50 million of subloans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) outside of \nColombo and be structured to provide the regulatory capital that would leverage an additional \n$533 million of lending (para. 11[ii]). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises financial exclusion. The Government of \nSri Lanka\u2019s national development strategy targets achieving upper middle-income status with \nimproved equity and protection of the vulnerable by 2025.4 Creating one million new jobs in the \nformal economy and increasing the labor force participation rate, mainly with micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), are cornerstones of the strategy.5 MSMEs have higher \ngrowth potential, create more jobs, and, over time, increase the tax base at a quicker pace than \nlarger enterprises. Because of their distribution across the whole country, they also contribute to \nreducing stubborn regional inequalities. \n \n4.  Access to finance is a key challenge for MSMEs, which face constraints to affordable \nfinancing both on the demand side, such as poor commercial viability and difficulty in meeting \nfinancial institutions\u2019 lending requirements; and on the supply side, such as financial institutions \nhaving operations poorly designed for MSMEs and an overreliance on collateral-based loans. As \na result, only 30% of Sri Lankan firms have sufficient access to bank loans and other capital. \nRelative to its peer countries, this puts Sri Lanka last in South Asia and 31st among the 32 \ndeveloping  member  countries  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  (footnote  2).  These \nconstraints are even greater for MSMEs that are led by women or located in rural areas. \n \n                                                \n1  Regional Development Bank was established under Act No. 41 of 2008 of Sri Lanka and is also doing business under \n\u201cPradeshiya Sanwardhana Bank,\u201d the Sinhala translation of its name. \n2  International Finance Corporation. 2017. IFC MSME Finance Gap 2017.

Vision 2025. Colombo. \n5  Under Sri Lanka\u2019s National Policy Framework for Small Medium Enterprise (SME) Development, MSMEs are defined \nas enterprises with annual turnover of less than SLRs750 million; and with fewer than 300 employees if in the \nmanufacturing sector, or with fewer than 200 employees if in the services sector. This project focuses specifically on \nMSEs, which are defined as those with annual turnover of less than SLRs250 million or with fewer than 50 employees. \n ", "2 \n5.  ADB support for access to finance. To help address this problem, ADB has provided \ncomprehensive support for MSME financing in Sri Lanka.6 ADB approved a $100 million Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Line of Credit Project in February 2016 that focused on \nunderserved MSMEs, such as those located in rural areas, led by women, and startups, and was \nfully disbursed by January 2018.7 Based on the successful achievement of its performance \nindicators, ADB approved two additional financing projects: (i) a $75.0 million loan (January \n2018)8 and  (ii)  a  $12.5  million  project  and  TA  grant  (June  2018)  that  targeted  women \nentrepreneurs and was funded by the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative.9 These two \nprojects, which began disbursing in 2018, are on track to achieving their performance indicators. \nSeveral nonsovereign projects also complement these sovereign initiatives.10 Notwithstanding \nthese efforts, MSME financial inclusion remains a priority for Sri Lanka and has been prioritized \nin ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022.11 \n \n6.  Regional Development Bank. RDB is a state-owned licensed specialized bank that the \ngovernment  formed  by  merging  six  provincial  development  banks  in  May  2010  under  the \nPradesiya Sanwarhana Bank Act No. 41 of 2008. RDB\u2019s mandate is to improve rural living \nstandards by providing accessible and affordable financial services. It is one of the 10 participating \nbanks in ADB\u2019s SME Line of Credit Project and has been proactively utilizing ADB\u2019s funds for \nenhancing MSMEs\u2019 access to finance. Its focus on women and borrowers that are rural MSEs is \nevident in its performance in the SME Line of Credit Project (Table 1). Despite its key role in \nexpanding MSE\u2019s access to finance and having sound financials, RDB requires additional capital \nto fund future growth. \n \nTable 1: Regional Development Bank\u2019s Performance in Asian Development Bank\u2019s Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprise Line of Credit Project, as of August 2017 \n  Regional  Other State- Peer Private-\nItems  Development Bank  Owned Banksa  Sector Banksa \nAverage loan size ($\u2019000)  16.7  44.4  98.8 \n% of SMEs led by women (in number)  31.1  25.9  26.3 \n% of SMEs outside of Colombo (in value)  96.3  88.0  82.1 \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \na  Other state-owned banks are the People\u2019s Bank and the Bank of Ceylon. Peer private-sector banks exclude banks \nthat the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has identified as systematically important and include DFCC Bank, NDB Bank, \nand Nations Trust Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  External environment. The proposed support to RDB comes amid a challenging outlook \nfor Sri Lankan banks. Sri Lanka started implementing higher regulatory capital ratios effective 1 \nJanuary 2019. To implement Basel III many banks raised capital to avoid a reduction in loan \n                                                \n6  Summary of Asian Development Bank\u2019s Support for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Sector in Sri Lanka \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n \n ", "3 \ngrowth.12 Monetary  conditions  have  been  tightening  with  three  policy  rate  increases  since \nFebruary 2016 in a bid to contain inflation. However, in April 2018, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \ncut the policy lending rate in part to reduce an increase in real lending rates, following a \ndeceleration in inflation. Further, Sri Lanka commenced implementing a new account standard on \nfinancial instruments, Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS) 9, in 2018. This accounting \nstandard will increase banks\u2019 resiliency, but, in the short term, it will require many banks to record \nhigher  provisions. 13  Moreover,  although  the  government  has  taken  steps  to  stabilize \nmacroeconomic conditions through an International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility and \na moderate buildup of foreign currency reserves, it is still contending with a marginal fiscal \nposition,14 upcoming foreign debt repayments, and rising oil prices.15 In these circumstances, \nbank  lending  tends  to  become  more  conservative,  with  MSMEs  generally  shouldering  the \nconsequences, particularly RDB\u2019s rural and MSE clients.16 \n \n8.  Value added by ADB assistance. This uncertain outlook makes ADB\u2019s assistance to \nRDB more important particularly because ADB\u2019s value addition in this project is multifaceted. First, \nin addition to creating leverage, as discussed in detail in para. 11 below, ADB\u2019s loan will provide \nRDB with needed liquidity. As monetary conditions have tightened, RDB has had to source a \nlarger proportion of its funding from time deposits, which are more expensive and make ADB\u2019s \nfunding more needed. Second, ADB\u2019s funding will have a 12.75-year tenor. Previous projects \nhave monitored how long Sri Lankan banks have lent to the same clients with and without access \nto ADB\u2019s long-term funding. The loans made with ADB funding have on average a 20% longer \ntenor. These longer tenors make MSMEs\u2019 capital investments easier to afford. Third, as discussed \nin detail in para. 22 below, the project includes an attached TA that will strengthen the operational \ncapacity of RDB across multiple areas, including deposit mobilization, loan origination, asset-\nliability management, and safeguards. Fourth, helping Sri Lanka to implement Basel III will \npromote financial stability, which is especially important because of the increasing downside risks \nto emerging markets following the end of the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing \nand start of the credit tightening cycle. Fifth, ADB played a key role in the project design. In June \n2017, ADB identified that RDB\u2014although operating effectively\u2014was facing capital constraints \nthat would become more serious with Basel III implementation. After consulting with RDB and the \ngovernment, ADB prepared an analysis on the size of the capital shortfall and need for TA support. \nThis analytical work led the Government of Sri Lanka to request a loan from ADB for tier 2 support \nfor RDB and serves as the foundation for the project. \n \n9.  Subordination. ADB\u2019s loan will help RDB meet the Basel III requirements because it will \nbe subordinated to RDB\u2019s obligations to its depositors and other senior lenders.17 This constitutes \nthe project\u2019s main innovation. Banks\u2019 capital structures are broadly divided into three layers. The \ntop layer consists of depositors and other senior lenders. The bottom layer consists of equity and \n                                                \n12 Basel III: Implementation in South Asia (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Basel III, an \ninternationally agreed set of measures developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, is a response to \nthe  global  financial  crisis  with  the  objective  to  make  banks  more  resilient  through  strengthening  minimum \nrequirements for capital and liquidity. \n13 Provisions are losses that banks recognize in anticipation of not being able to fully recover customer loans. Banking \nregulations and accounting standards govern how much banks must provide for such provisions. \n14 The marginal fiscal position comes against a positive development on the primary balance that was marginally in \nsurplus in 2017. \n15 International Monetary Fund. 2018. Sri Lanka: Third Review under the Extended Arrangement under the Extended \nFund Facility and Request for Modification of Performance Criterion-Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by \nthe Executive Director for Sri Lanka. Washington, DC. \n16 Despite these challenges, MSME financial performance under ongoing ADB projects in Sri Lanka has been \nacceptable. For the SME Line of Credit Project, the gross nonperforming loan ratio was 7% as of August 2017. \n17 RDB borrows from the government and other financial institutions. \n \n ", "4 \nother forms of tier 1 capital. Subordinated loans and other forms of tier 2 capital lie in between. In \nthe event of liquidation, tier 1 capital is the first to sustain losses, followed by tier 2 capital, which \nwould be written down or converted into equity, and finally senior debt. ADB\u2019s loan to RDB will be \npart of this middle layer. \n \n10.  Rationale  for  sovereign-guaranteed  subordinated  loan.  There  are  two  primary \nreasons for the proposed structure. First, ADB\u2019s loan will not contribute to RDB meeting the higher \nregulatory  capital  ratios  required  under  Basel  III  unless  it  qualifies  as  tier  2  capital,  and \nsubordination as well as limitations on events of acceleration of loan maturity are basic criteria for \ntier 2 capital.18 Second, it addresses the government\u2019s fiscal challenges. Sri Lanka\u2019s budget is \nsubject to the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, which sets spending and guarantee limits. \nSri Lanka has available headroom under its guarantee limit and welcomes a structure under which \nADB directly provides tier 2 capital to RDB while preserving its spending headroom for other \npriorities. \n \n11.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. ADB\u2019s tier 2 loan will provide needed support to \nRDB and Sri Lanka and help ADB meet its commitments under Strategy 2030, which calls for \nADB to do the following.19 \n(i)  Support innovative financial products. The proposed tier 2 loan is a first for \nsovereign operations. This innovation will allow ADB to support a bank whose \nperformance is solid (para. 24) but would have been challenging to finance through \nits nonsovereign operations given the subordination and long tenor.20 \n(ii)  Increase the leverage of its own financing. Under a normal credit line, ADB\u2019s \nloan would support an equal amount of lending to subprojects. This project will do \nthe same. However, once ADB\u2019s subordinated loan is on RDB\u2019s balance sheet, \nRDB can count it toward the central bank\u2019s requirement to hold SLRs12.5 of \nregulatory capital for every SLRs100 of risk-weighted assets. Because MSME \nloans  carry  a  75%  risk  weighting  in  Sri  Lanka,  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  provide  the \nregulatory capital for an additional $533 million of lending\u2014leveraging ADB\u2019s loan \n10.7 times.21 \n(iii)  Increase its support for banks to help increase their capacity, quality, and \nreach, particularly for low-income populations. Financial inclusion is closely \ncorrelated with reduced poverty, and RDB plays a unique role in the Sri Lankan \nbanking  system  in  promoting  financial  inclusion  among  rural  low-income \npopulations  (para.  6)  that  other  licensed  banks  and  even  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions cannot replicate. \n(iv)  Accelerate progress in gender equality in developing member countries \nthrough  financial  inclusion.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender \nmainstreaming and expands training that is being provided to 750 women under \nongoing TA projects in Sri Lanka to an additional 500 women. The loan will also \nrequire RDB to onlend to at least 500 women-led enterprises and effect institutional \n                                                \n18 To comply with tier 2 capital requirements, ADB\u2014or Sri Lanka following a guarantee call\u2014may accelerate the \nmaturity of any outstanding principal only in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. \n19 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n20 There  are  examples  of  tier  2  loans  through  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations:  ADB.  2007.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Subordinated Loan to the International Bank \nof Azerbaijan. Manila; and ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loans and Technical Assistance to Credo Microfinance Organization, FINCA Bank Georgia, and TBC \nBank for the Financial Inclusion for Micro and Small Business Growth in Georgia. Manila. \n21 ($50 million ADB subordinated loan) / (0.125 regulatory capital requirement * 0.75 risk-asset weighting for MSME \nloans) = regulatory capital for $533.33 million of MSME lending. \n ", "5 \nreforms that will enable RDB to better serve these clients.  \n(v)  Facilitate  common  frameworks  in financial regulations  and  supervision. \nRDB\u2019s compliance with the Basel III requirements are important for it and the \nbroader stability of the Sri Lankan banking sector given other large state banks \nhave already received capital infusions (para 13). If one of the government-owned \nbanks were not to comply, it would undermine the credibility of the central bank \nand provide other banks with a precedent for ignoring regulations. \n \n12.  Risk management of an innovative approach. Although subordination carries financial \nand reputational risks, these are appropriately managed. If RDB were to default, a tier 2 loan \nwould recover less than loans from senior creditors. However, this risk to ADB is fully mitigated \nby Sri Lanka\u2019s guarantee, which is payable on first demand even if senior creditors have not been \npaid. The government would then subrograte (i.e., step into ADB\u2019s place to enforce the loan). \nADB\u2019s Treasury Department has confirmed that the proposed sovereign-guaranteed loan poses \nno special risk to ADB\u2019s credit rating or its preferred creditor status. ADB has also mitigated the \nreputational risk of the innovative product failing by communicating clearly with the government \nabout the implications of subordination. Moreover, the following circumstances make it highly \nfavorable to pilot this innovation: (i) ADB knows the Sri Lankan banking sector well and has a \nsuccessful track record in the sector, (ii) the borrower is financially sound (para. 24) and is under \nstringent supervision by the central bank, (iii) the central bank started to enforce Basel III on first \nof January 2019, and (iv) the attached TA will help to strengthen further the borrower\u2019s operations \nand management. \n \n13.  Sustainability. Since the loan size is less than the estimated tier 2 funding gap through \n2022, the government has requested ADB to consider providing additional financing as may be \nrequired. Additional financing could be justified if the project is satisfactorily implemented. Beyond \nADB\u2019s  project,  support  for  strengthening  operational  capacity  of  RDB  will  support  higher \nprofitability, strengthen organic balance sheet growth, and provide the groundwork for possible \nstrategic  investments  in  RDB,  including  from  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations.  As  for  the \nsustainability of other state-owned banks, the two systemically important institutions\u2014Bank of \nCeylon and People\u2019s Bank\u2014each received SLRs5 billion ($27.3 million) capital increases at the \nend of 2017 to meet the Basel III requirements.22 \n \n14.  Lessons learned. The proposed loan draws from the recommendations of the thematic \nevaluation Support for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, 2005\u20132017 published in August \n2018.  That  evaluation  highlighted  that  access  to  finance  operations  has  at  times  lacked \ndevelopment focus. Accordingly, under the project, ADB has restricted eligible subprojects to \nMSEs outside of Colombo, limited the maximum size of subloans to SLRs50 million ($273,822), \nrequired at least 500 subloans to be lent to women,23 and is providing capacity development to \nRDB through the attached TA. The evaluation also identified shortcomings in implementation and \nmonitoring results. However, this loan will benefit from the precedent of the SME Line of Credit \nProject that established a robust monitoring system with which RDB has been complying. There \nis also an intrinsic incentive for RDB to achieve the project\u2019s objectives. Because the loan is less \nthan RDB\u2019s total tier 2 capital needs over the next 5 years, there would be grounds for additional \nfinancing if RDB performs well. The evaluation also noted that support for policy reforms has \ndelivered good results. As part of the attached TA, ADB will prepare an assessment of the \ngovernment\u2019s various initiatives for MSME access to finance with the intent of expanding those \n                                                \n22 The Central Bank of Sri Lanka recognizes six licensed banks as systemically important. The other four are privately \nowned.  \n23 An SME is defined as an SME led by women when at least 51% of its enterprise ownership is controlled by women, \nat least 60% of senior managers are women, or at least 50% of board members are women. \n ", "6 \nprojects that are working well and winding down or reforming those that are not. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: MSME access to finance enhanced.24 The \nproject will have the following outcome: RDB\u2019s capacity to serve its client MSMEs strengthened.25 \nThe project area is national. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: RDB\u2019s operations expanded. The project will provide $50 million for RDB to \nexpand its MSME lending, and the attached TA will support a deposit marketing campaign to \nsource low-cost funding for future growth. \n \n17.  Output 2: RDB\u2019s operational capacity strengthened. Under this output, ADB will \nsupport RDB to develop a strategy to increase outreach to underserved clients (including women), \nintroduce sex-disaggregated management information system reporting, develop and implement \nan  ADB-approved  environmental  and  social  safeguards  system,  strengthen  asset-liability \nmanagement, and train loan officers in credit evaluation. \n \n18.  Output 3: Capacity of MSEs to access financial services enhanced. This output will \nenable RDB to train 500 women entrepreneurs who are its current and prospective clients how to \nprepare a business plan. These women are in addition to 750 other women being trained under \nan ongoing TA in Sri Lanka. RDB will offer successful graduates of the training program a 0.50% \ndiscount on the interest rate of their subsequent loan. \n \nD.  Summary Financing Plan \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $50 million for which RDB has requested a regular loan \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with a sovereign guarantee. The loan will have a 12 years \nand 9 months term with a bullet payment at maturity; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and guarantee agreements. Based on the repayment terms, the average maturity is 12 years \nand 9 months, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.26 The government is not \ncharging RDB a guarantee fee, but RDB will be responsible for the foreign exchange risk. \n \n20.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance $50 million of subprojects \nconsisting of subloans to MSEs outside of Colombo with the maximum size of a subloan capped \nat SLRs50 million ($273,822).27 \n \n                                                \n24 Government of Sri Lanka. 2017.

In December 2017, it injected SLRs2.5 billion \n($15.4 million) of tier 1 and is planning to inject further tier 1 equity by 2019 through merging RDB with Lankaputhra \nDevelopment Bank, another state-owned bank with excess tier 1 equity. \n27 There is no sectoral restriction or target on MSE subprojects. At corporate level, RDB\u2019s gross loan exposure is widely \ndistributed across agriculture (23.7%), construction/housing (24.6%), manufacturing (16.4%) and trading (15.6%) in \n2017.       \n ", "7 \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  50.0  100.0 \nTotal  50.0  100.0 \nNote: The government is providing counterpart funding through tier 1 equity for the Regional Development Bank to \ncomply with Basel III capital requirement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).28 RDB will onlend to sub-borrowers at a market-\ndetermined interest rate. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  February 2019\u2013February 2022 \nEstimated completion date  February 2022 \nEstimated loan closing date  August 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee chaired by the secretary of Ministry of Public Enterprise and \nKandy City Development or its successor and initially comprising: \n(i)  representatives from the relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance \nand Economic Affairs; \n(ii)  a representative from the Department of External Resources; \n(iii)  the general manager, chief financial officer, and one deputy general \nmanager from RDB; and \n(iv)  a representative from ADB. \n(ii)  Executing agency  Regional Development Bank \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Regional Development Banka \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Regional Development Bank. The chief financial officer will lead the \nimplementation unit with the support of 10 staff. \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, works, and non-consultancy services will follow the ADB \nProcurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be undertaken by the \nindividual beneficiary; fitness for purpose can be achieved by using established \nprivate sector and commercial practices. \nRetroactive financing  Retroactive financing will be allowed up to 20% of the loan amount for \nsubprojects that meet eligibility criteria, including safeguard requirements, \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness but no earlier than 12 months before the \nsigning of the loan agreement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between RDB and ADB. RDB will semiannually submit withdrawal \nrequests to ADB for the equivalent amount of the expected eligible subloans \nfrom micro and small enterprises for the coming 6 months. ADB will disburse \nthese advances to an RDB bank account. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, RDB = Regional Development Bank. \na The Department of Development Finance, Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, will be the implementing \nagency for the study on the effectiveness of government financial inclusion programs, which is funded under the \nattached technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n28 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n22.  The attached technical assistance is an integral part of the project. It will support RDB\u2019s \ndeposit marketing campaign under output 1 (para. 16), the operational capacity development of \nRDB described under output 2 (para. 17), the training of women entrepreneurs described under \noutput 3 (para. 18), and a study on the effectiveness of Sri Lanka\u2019s efforts to promote financial \ninclusion (para. 14). The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1.0 million will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB and the \nremainder is in-kind contribution from RDB and the government. RDB will be the executing agency \nfor all TA outputs except for the study on the effectiveness of government financial inclusion \nprograms with an emphasis on women borrowers, which the Department of Development Finance \nof the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs will implement. RDB and the government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economically, the gains will come from (i) RDB\u2019s increased lending capacity to MSMEs \nand (ii) the project\u2019s requirements to lend to rural MSEs, which typically struggle to access the \nbanking system.30 There are also important positive externalities from this project\u2019s contribution \nto a well-capitalized banking system. \n \n24.  Financially, RDB is dependably profitable despite having a business model that focuses \non MSE lending, which carries higher nonperforming loan rates than lending to medium and large-\nsized enterprises, and an extensive branch network, which is central to RDB\u2019s mandate to serve \nrural areas. The attached TA will strengthen RDB\u2019s liquidity and market risk management. Capital \nis self-evidently weak, but the projected capital shortfall is the result of RDB\u2019s steady growth and \nBasel III\u2019s higher capital requirements and is not precipitated by financial losses.31 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n25.  The overall integrity risk is low and the financial management risk is moderate. Integrity \ndue  diligence  was  carried  out,  and  its  risk  was  assessed  low.  Although  RDB\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  has  limitations,  such  as  cumbersome  loan  origination  and  evolving  risk \nmanagement, mitigations include (i) the capacity development for RDB under the attached TA, \n(ii) a robust project reporting system developed under the previous ADB projects in Sri Lanka, \nand (iii) RDB\u2019s satisfactory performance in those previous ADB projects. With these measures, \nthe over financial management arrangements are considered adequate. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and RDB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 27). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Poverty impact. Although Sri Lanka has made notable progress in reducing poverty, \nregional imbalances remain. MSMEs struggle to borrow because they often lack the real estate \n                                                \n30 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nor financial assets that banks require as collateral. Therefore, the project targets rural MSEs that \ntypically face the greatest financial barriers. The project impact includes employment creation and \nincreased income, especially among the targeted MSEs. \n \n28.  Gender and social dimensions. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. \nIt builds on and complements similar approaches followed in previous projects, such as the SME \nLine of Credit Project (2016), the ongoing JFPR TA (2016), and related Women Entrepreneurs \nFinance Initiative (We-Fi) Grant and TA Project (2018).32 The project commits to women\u2019s \nempowerment and gender equity, including requirements for RDB to prepare a Board strategy to \nincrease outreach to underserved clients (including women), to lend to at least 500 MSEs led by \nwomen, and to train 500 women entrepreneurs to prepare a business plan.33 This emphasis is \nparticularly important given Sri Lanka\u2019s low women labor participation rate of 39%, which suggests \na large pool of untapped human resources for national economic development. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:34 \n(i)  Environment (category FI). Subprojects with significant environmental impacts \n(category A) are excluded. Subprojects with environmental impacts that are not \nsignificant  (category  B)  are  initially  excluded.  ADB  may  subsequently  allow \ncategory B subprojects, if RDB implements an environmental and social safeguard \nsystem acceptable to ADB. \n(ii)  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  FI-C).  Subprojects  with  involuntary \nresettlement impacts (category A or B) are excluded. \n(iii)  Indigenous  peoples  (category  FI-C).  Subprojects  with  indigenous  peoples \nimpacts (category A or B) are excluded. \n \n30.  Safeguard  due  diligence  concluded  that  RDB\u2019s  overall  lending  entails  minimal \nenvironmental, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples impacts because of its MSE focus. \nADB  supported  RDB  in  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Line  of  Credit  Project,  and  all \nsubprojects financed through RDB under that project were category C. During due diligence, site \nvisits of potential subprojects were also confirmed category C. RDB will screen subprojects \nagainst the Prohibited Investment Activities List, and a shortlist of category C subprojects will \nfurther guide subproject selection.35 To strengthen RDB\u2019s capacity in safeguards and enable it to \nfinance subprojects that may have safeguards impacts in the future, the attached TA will help \nRDB establish and staff an environmental and social safeguards system. \n \n                                                \n32 ADB.

I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $50,000,000 \nto the Regional Development Bank, to be guaranteed by the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \nLanka, for the Strengthening the Regional Development Bank Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 12.75 years with a bullet \nrepayment at maturity; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n17 January 2019 \n                                                \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nMSME access to finance enhanced (Vision 2025)a \n \n  Performance  Data Sources and   \n  Indicators with  Reporting   \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nRDB\u2019s capacity to serve  a.
