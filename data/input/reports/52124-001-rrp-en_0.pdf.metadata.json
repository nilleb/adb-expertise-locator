The  report  also \ndescribes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction for the Enhancing Rural Micro and Small-Sized Enterprise Finance, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nResearch from 2017 confirms earlier findings that limited access to finance is a key barrier \nfor entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka.2 One of the government\u2019s key policy tools to address this challenge \nis through RDB, whose mission is to strengthen the living standards of the rural population  by \nproviding  affordable  and  accessible  credit  facilities.  By  statute,  RDB  is  wholly  owned  by  the \ngovernment  and  other  state-owned banks.3 The  project  would provide  long-term financing  that \nwould  directly  fund  $50  million  of  subloans  to  micro  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs)  outside  of \nColombo  and  be  structured  to  provide  the  regulatory  capital  that  would  leverage  an  additional \n$533 million of lending (para. 11[ii]). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises financial exclusion. The Government of \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  national  development  strategy  targets  achieving  upper  middle-income  status  with \nimproved equity and protection of the vulnerable by 2025.4 Creating one million new jobs in the \nformal economy and increasing the labor force participation rate, mainly  with micro, small, and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs),  are  cornerstones  of  the  strategy. 5 MSMEs  have  higher \ngrowth potential, create more jobs, and, over time, increase the tax base at a quicker pace than \nlarger enterprises. Because of their distribution across the whole country, they also contribute to \nreducing stubborn regional inequalities. \n \nAccess  to  finance  is  a  key  challenge  for  MSMEs,  which  face  constraints  to  affordable \n4. \nfinancing  both  on  the  demand  side,  such  as  poor commercial  viability  and difficulty  in  meeting \nfinancial institutions\u2019 lending requirements; and on the supply side, such as financial institutions \nhaving operations poorly designed for MSMEs and an overreliance on collateral-based loans. As \na  result,  only  30%  of  Sri  Lankan  firms  have  sufficient  access  to  bank  loans  and  other  capital. \nRelative  to  its  peer  countries,  this  puts  Sri  Lanka  last  in  South  Asia  and  31st  among  the  32 \ndeveloping  member  countries  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  (footnote  2).  These \nconstraints are even greater for MSMEs that are led by women or located in rural areas. \n \n\n                                                \n1  Regional Development Bank was established under Act No. 41 of 2008 of Sri Lanka and is also doing business under \n\n\u201cPradeshiya Sanwardhana Bank,\u201d the Sinhala translation of its name. \n\n2  International Finance Corporation. 2017. IFC MSME Finance Gap 2017. Washington, DC. \n3  The  government  holds  87.25%  of  RDB\u2019s  shares,  and  the  remaining  shares  are  equally  divided  between  three \n\ngovernment-owned banks\u23afthe Bank of Ceylon, the National Savings Banks, and People\u2019s Bank. \n\n4  Government of Sri Lanka. 2017. Vision 2025. Colombo. \n5  Under Sri Lanka\u2019s National Policy Framework for Small Medium Enterprise (SME) Development, MSMEs are defined \nas  enterprises  with  annual  turnover  of  less  than  SLRs750  million;  and  with  fewer  than  300  employees  if  in  the \nmanufacturing sector, or with fewer than 200 employees if in the services sector. This project focuses specifically on \nMSEs, which are defined as those with annual turnover of less than SLRs250 million or with fewer than 50 employees. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nADB support for access to finance. To help address this problem, ADB has provided \n5. \ncomprehensive support for MSME financing in Sri Lanka.6 ADB approved a $100 million Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Line of Credit Project in February 2016 that focused on \nunderserved MSMEs, such as those located in rural areas, led by women, and startups, and was \nfully  disbursed  by  January  2018. 7 Based  on  the  successful  achievement  of  its  performance \nindicators,  ADB  approved  two  additional  financing  projects:  (i)  a  $75.0  million  loan  (January \n2018) 8  and  (ii)  a  $12.5  million  project  and  TA  grant  (June  2018)  that  targeted  women \nentrepreneurs  and  was  funded  by  the  Women  Entrepreneurs  Finance  Initiative. 9 These  two \nprojects, which began disbursing in 2018, are on track to achieving their performance indicators. \nSeveral  nonsovereign  projects  also  complement  these  sovereign  initiatives.10 Notwithstanding \nthese efforts, MSME financial inclusion remains a priority for Sri Lanka and has been prioritized \nin ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022.11 \n \n6. \nRegional Development Bank. RDB is a state-owned licensed specialized bank that the \ngovernment  formed  by  merging  six  provincial  development  banks  in  May  2010  under  the \nPradesiya  Sanwarhana  Bank  Act  No.  41  of  2008.  RDB\u2019s  mandate  is  to  improve  rural  living \nstandards by providing accessible and affordable financial services. It is one of the 10 participating \nbanks  in  ADB\u2019s  SME  Line  of  Credit  Project  and  has  been  proactively  utilizing  ADB\u2019s funds for \nenhancing MSMEs\u2019 access to finance. Its focus on women and borrowers that are rural MSEs is \nevident  in  its  performance  in  the  SME  Line  of  Credit  Project  (Table  1).  Despite  its  key  role  in \nexpanding MSE\u2019s access to finance and having sound financials, RDB requires additional capital \nto fund future growth. \n \nTable 1: Regional Development Bank\u2019s Performance in Asian Development Bank\u2019s Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprise Line of Credit Project, as of August 2017 \n\n \nItems \nAverage loan size ($\u2019000) \n% of SMEs led by women (in number) \n% of SMEs outside of Colombo (in value) \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \na  Other state-owned banks are the People\u2019s Bank and the Bank of Ceylon.

The proposed support to RDB comes amid a challenging outlook \nfor Sri Lankan banks. Sri Lanka started implementing higher regulatory capital ratios effective 1 \nJanuary  2019.  To  implement  Basel  III  many  banks  raised  capital  to  avoid  a  reduction  in  loan \n\n                                                \n6  Summary of Asian Development Bank\u2019s Support for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Sector in Sri Lanka \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  ADB.  2016.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fgrowth. 12  Monetary  conditions  have  been  tightening  with  three  policy  rate  increases  since \nFebruary 2016 in a bid to contain inflation. However, in April 2018, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \ncut  the  policy  lending  rate  in  part  to  reduce  an  increase  in  real  lending  rates,  following  a \ndeceleration in inflation. Further, Sri Lanka commenced implementing a new account standard on \nfinancial  instruments,  Sri  Lanka  Accounting  Standards  (SLFRS)  9,  in  2018.  This  accounting \nstandard will increase banks\u2019 resiliency, but, in the short term, it will require many banks to record \nhigher  provisions. 13  Moreover,  although  the  government  has  taken  steps  to  stabilize \nmacroeconomic conditions through an International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility and \na  moderate  buildup  of  foreign  currency  reserves,  it  is  still  contending  with  a  marginal  fiscal \nposition,14 upcoming  foreign  debt  repayments,  and  rising  oil  prices.15 In  these  circumstances, \nbank  lending  tends  to  become  more  conservative,  with  MSMEs  generally  shouldering  the \nconsequences, particularly RDB\u2019s rural and MSE clients.16 \n \n8. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  This  uncertain  outlook  makes  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to \nRDB more important particularly because ADB\u2019s value addition in this project is multifaceted. First, \nin addition to creating leverage, as discussed in detail in para. 11 below, ADB\u2019s loan will provide \nRDB  with  needed  liquidity.  As  monetary  conditions  have  tightened,  RDB  has  had  to  source  a \nlarger proportion of its funding from time deposits, which are more expensive and make ADB\u2019s \nfunding  more  needed.  Second,  ADB\u2019s  funding  will  have  a  12.75-year  tenor.  Previous  projects \nhave monitored how long Sri Lankan banks have lent to the same clients with and without access \nto ADB\u2019s long-term funding. The loans made with ADB funding have on average a 20% longer \ntenor. These longer tenors make MSMEs\u2019 capital investments easier to afford. Third, as discussed \nin detail in para. 22 below, the project includes an attached TA that will strengthen the operational \ncapacity  of  RDB  across  multiple  areas,  including  deposit  mobilization,  loan  origination,  asset-\nliability  management,  and  safeguards.  Fourth,  helping  Sri  Lanka  to  implement  Basel  III  will \npromote financial stability, which is especially important because of the increasing downside risks \nto emerging markets following the end of the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing \nand start of the credit tightening cycle. Fifth, ADB played a key role in the project design. In June \n2017,  ADB  identified  that  RDB\u2014although  operating  effectively\u2014was  facing  capital  constraints \nthat would become more serious with Basel III implementation. After consulting with RDB and the \ngovernment, ADB prepared an analysis on the size of the capital shortfall and need for TA support. \nThis analytical work led the Government of Sri Lanka to request a loan from ADB for tier 2 support \nfor RDB and serves as the foundation for the project. \n \n9. \nSubordination. ADB\u2019s loan will help RDB meet the Basel III requirements because it will \nbe subordinated to RDB\u2019s obligations to its depositors and other senior lenders.17 This constitutes \nthe project\u2019s main innovation. Banks\u2019 capital structures are broadly divided into three layers. The \ntop layer consists of depositors and other senior lenders. The bottom layer consists of equity and \n\n                                                \n12 Basel III: Implementation in South Asia (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Basel III, an \ninternationally agreed set of measures developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, is a response to \nthe  global  financial  crisis  with  the  objective  to  make  banks  more  resilient  through  strengthening  minimum \nrequirements for capital and liquidity. \n\n13 Provisions are losses that banks recognize in anticipation of not being able to fully recover customer loans. Banking \n\nregulations and accounting standards govern how much banks must provide for such provisions. \n\n14 The marginal fiscal position comes against a positive development on the primary balance that was marginally in \n\nsurplus in 2017. \n\n15 International Monetary Fund. 2018. Sri Lanka: Third Review under the Extended Arrangement under the Extended \nFund Facility and Request for Modification of Performance Criterion-Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by \nthe Executive Director for Sri Lanka. Washington, DC. \n\n16 Despite  these  challenges,  MSME  financial  performance  under  ongoing  ADB  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  has  been \nacceptable. For the SME Line of Credit Project, the gross nonperforming loan ratio was 7% as of August 2017. \n\n17 RDB borrows from the government and other financial institutions. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nother forms of tier 1 capital. Subordinated loans and other forms of tier 2 capital lie in between. In \nthe event of liquidation, tier 1 capital is the first to sustain losses, followed by tier 2 capital, which \nwould be written down or converted into equity, and finally senior debt. ADB\u2019s loan to RDB will be \npart of this middle layer. \n \n10. \nRationale  for  sovereign-guaranteed  subordinated  loan.  There  are  two  primary \nreasons for the proposed structure. First, ADB\u2019s loan will not contribute to RDB meeting the higher \nregulatory  capital  ratios  required  under  Basel  III  unless  it  qualifies  as  tier  2  capital,  and \nsubordination as well as limitations on events of acceleration of loan maturity are basic criteria for \ntier  2  capital.18 Second,  it addresses  the government\u2019s fiscal  challenges. Sri  Lanka\u2019s budget  is \nsubject to the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, which sets spending and guarantee limits. \nSri Lanka has available headroom under its guarantee limit and welcomes a structure under which \nADB  directly  provides  tier  2  capital  to  RDB  while  preserving  its  spending  headroom  for  other \npriorities. \n \n11. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. ADB\u2019s tier 2 loan will provide needed support to \nRDB and Sri Lanka and help ADB meet its commitments under  Strategy 2030, which calls for \nADB to do the following.19 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSupport  innovative  financial  products.  The  proposed  tier  2  loan  is  a  first  for \nsovereign  operations.  This  innovation  will  allow  ADB  to  support  a  bank  whose \nperformance is solid (para. 24) but would have been challenging to finance through \nits nonsovereign operations given the subordination and long tenor.20 \nIncrease the leverage of its own financing. Under a normal credit line, ADB\u2019s \nloan would support an equal amount of lending to subprojects. This project will do \nthe  same.  However,  once ADB\u2019s  subordinated  loan is  on  RDB\u2019s  balance  sheet, \nRDB  can  count  it  toward  the  central  bank\u2019s  requirement  to  hold  SLRs12.5  of \nregulatory  capital  for  every  SLRs100  of  risk-weighted  assets.  Because  MSME \nloans  carry  a  75%  risk  weighting  in  Sri  Lanka,  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  provide  the \nregulatory capital for an additional $533 million of lending\u2014leveraging ADB\u2019s loan \n10.7 times.21 \nIncrease its support for banks to help increase their capacity, quality, and \nreach,  particularly  for  low-income  populations.  Financial  inclusion  is  closely \ncorrelated with reduced poverty, and RDB plays a unique role in the Sri Lankan \nbanking  system  in  promoting  financial  inclusion  among  rural  low-income \npopulations  (para.  6)  that  other  licensed  banks  and  even  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions cannot replicate. \nAccelerate  progress  in  gender  equality  in  developing  member  countries \nis  classified  effective  gender \nthrough  financial \nmainstreaming and expands training that is being provided to 750 women under \nongoing TA projects in Sri Lanka to an additional 500 women. The loan will also \nrequire RDB to onlend to at least 500 women-led enterprises and effect institutional \n\ninclusion.  The  project \n\n                                                \n18 To  comply  with  tier  2  capital  requirements,  ADB\u2014or  Sri  Lanka  following  a  guarantee  call\u2014may  accelerate  the \n\nmaturity of any outstanding principal only in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. \n\n19 ADB.  2018.  Strategy  2030:  Achieving  a  Prosperous,  Inclusive,  Resilient,  and  Sustainable  Asia  and  the  Pacific. \n\n20 There  are  examples  of  tier  2  loans  through  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations:  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n21 ($50 million ADB subordinated loan)  / (0.125 regulatory capital requirement *  0.75 risk-asset weighting for MSME \n\nloans) = regulatory capital for $533.33 million of MSME lending. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f(v) \n\nreforms that will enable RDB to better serve these clients.  \nFacilitate  common  frameworks  in  financial  regulations  and  supervision. \nRDB\u2019s  compliance  with  the  Basel  III  requirements  are  important  for  it  and  the \nbroader stability  of  the Sri  Lankan  banking  sector given  other  large  state banks \nhave already received capital infusions (para 13). If one of the government-owned \nbanks were not to comply, it would undermine the credibility of the central bank \nand provide other banks with a precedent for ignoring regulations. \n\n \nRisk management of an innovative approach. Although subordination carries financial \n12. \nand  reputational  risks,  these  are  appropriately  managed.  If  RDB  were  to  default,  a  tier  2  loan \nwould recover less than loans from senior creditors. However, this risk to ADB is fully mitigated \nby Sri Lanka\u2019s guarantee, which is payable on first demand even if senior creditors have not been \npaid.  The  government  would  then  subrograte  (i.e.,  step  into  ADB\u2019s  place  to  enforce  the  loan). \nADB\u2019s Treasury Department has confirmed that the proposed sovereign-guaranteed loan poses \nno special risk to ADB\u2019s credit rating or its preferred creditor status. ADB has also mitigated the \nreputational risk of the innovative product failing by communicating clearly with the government \nabout  the  implications  of  subordination.  Moreover,  the  following  circumstances  make  it  highly \nfavorable to pilot this innovation: (i) ADB knows the Sri Lankan banking sector well and has a \nsuccessful track record in the sector, (ii) the borrower is financially sound (para. 24) and is under \nstringent supervision by the central bank, (iii) the central bank started to enforce Basel III on first \nof January 2019, and (iv) the attached TA will help to strengthen further the borrower\u2019s operations \nand management. \n \n13. \nSustainability. Since the loan size is less than the estimated tier 2 funding gap through \n2022, the government has requested ADB to consider providing additional financing as may be \nrequired. Additional financing could be justified if the project is satisfactorily implemented. Beyond \nADB\u2019s  project,  support  for  strengthening  operational  capacity  of  RDB  will  support  higher \nprofitability, strengthen organic balance sheet growth, and provide the groundwork for possible \nstrategic  investments  in  RDB,  including  from  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations.  As  for  the \nsustainability  of  other  state-owned  banks,  the  two  systemically  important  institutions\u2014Bank  of \nCeylon and People\u2019s Bank\u2014each received SLRs5 billion ($27.3 million) capital increases at the \nend of 2017 to meet the Basel III requirements.22 \n \n14. \nLessons learned. The proposed loan draws from the recommendations of the thematic \nevaluation  Support  for  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises,  2005\u20132017  published  in  August \n2018.  That  evaluation  highlighted  that  access  to  finance  operations  has  at  times  lacked \ndevelopment  focus.  Accordingly,  under  the  project,  ADB  has  restricted  eligible  subprojects  to \nMSEs outside of Colombo, limited the maximum size of subloans to SLRs50 million ($273,822), \nrequired at least 500 subloans to be lent to women,23 and is providing capacity development to \nRDB through the attached TA. The evaluation also identified shortcomings in implementation and \nmonitoring results. However, this loan will benefit from the precedent of the SME Line of Credit \nProject that established a robust monitoring system with which RDB has been complying. There \nis also an intrinsic incentive for RDB to achieve the project\u2019s objectives. Because the loan is less \nthan RDB\u2019s total tier 2 capital needs over the next 5 years, there would be grounds for additional \nfinancing  if  RDB  performs  well.  The  evaluation  also  noted  that  support  for  policy  reforms  has \ndelivered  good  results.  As  part  of  the  attached  TA,  ADB  will  prepare  an  assessment  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s various initiatives for MSME access to finance with the intent of expanding those \n\n                                                \n22 The Central Bank of Sri Lanka recognizes six licensed banks as systemically important. The other four are privately \n\nowned.  \n\n23 An SME is defined as an SME led by women when at least 51% of its enterprise ownership is controlled by women, \n\nat least 60% of senior managers are women, or at least 50% of board members are women. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nprojects that are working well and winding down or reforming those that are not. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: MSME access to finance enhanced.24 The \n15. \nproject will have the following outcome: RDB\u2019s capacity to serve its client MSMEs strengthened.25 \nThe project area is national. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nOutput 1: RDB\u2019s operations expanded. The project will provide $50 million for RDB to \nexpand  its  MSME  lending,  and  the  attached  TA  will  support  a  deposit  marketing  campaign  to \nsource low-cost funding for future growth. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  RDB\u2019s  operational  capacity  strengthened.  Under  this  output,  ADB  will \nsupport RDB to develop a strategy to increase outreach to underserved clients (including women), \nintroduce sex-disaggregated management information system reporting, develop and implement \nan  ADB-approved  environmental  and  social  safeguards  system,  strengthen  asset-liability \nmanagement, and train loan officers in credit evaluation. \n \nOutput 3: Capacity of MSEs to access financial services enhanced. This output will \n18. \nenable RDB to train 500 women entrepreneurs who are its current and prospective clients how to \nprepare a business plan. These women are in addition to 750 other women being trained under \nan ongoing TA in Sri Lanka. RDB will offer successful graduates of the training program a 0.50% \ndiscount on the interest rate of their subsequent loan. \n \nD. \n \nThe project is estimated to cost $50 million for which RDB has requested a regular loan \n19. \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with a sovereign guarantee. The loan will have a 12 years \nand  9  months  term  with  a  bullet  payment  at  maturity;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and guarantee agreements. Based on the repayment terms, the average maturity is 12 years \nand  9  months,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB. 26 The  government  is  not \ncharging RDB a guarantee fee, but RDB will be responsible for the foreign exchange risk. \n \n20. \nThe  summary  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  ADB  will  finance  $50  million  of  subprojects \nconsisting of subloans to MSEs outside of Colombo with the maximum size of a subloan capped \nat SLRs50 million ($273,822).27 \n \n\nSummary Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n24 Government of Sri Lanka. 2017.

In December 2017, it injected SLRs2.5 billion \n($15.4 million) of tier 1 and is planning to inject further tier 1 equity by 2019 through merging RDB with Lankaputhra \nDevelopment Bank, another state-owned bank with excess tier 1 equity. \n\n27 There is no sectoral restriction or target on MSE subprojects. At corporate level, RDB\u2019s gross loan exposure is widely \ndistributed across agriculture (23.7%), construction/housing (24.6%), manufacturing (16.4%) and trading (15.6%) in \n2017.       \n\n\fTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan) \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \n50.0 \n50.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\nNote: The government is providing counterpart funding through tier 1 equity for the Regional Development Bank to \ncomply with Basel III capital requirement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE. \n \n21. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe  project  administration  manual  (PAM). 28  RDB  will  onlend  to  sub-borrowers  at  a  market-\ndetermined interest rate. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nFebruary 2019\u2013February 2022 \nFebruary 2022 \nAugust 2022 \n\nSteering committee chaired by the secretary of Ministry of Public Enterprise and \nKandy City Development or its successor and initially comprising: \n(i) \n\nrepresentatives from the relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance \nand Economic Affairs; \n\n(ii)  a representative from the Department of External Resources; \n(iii)  the general manager, chief financial officer, and one deputy general \n\nmanager from RDB; and \n(iv)  a representative from ADB. \n(ii)  Executing agency \nRegional Development Bank \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Regional Development Banka \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nRetroactive financing \n\nDisbursement \n\nRegional Development Bank.

Procurement will be undertaken by the \nindividual beneficiary; fitness for purpose can be achieved by using established \nprivate sector and commercial practices. \nRetroactive financing will be allowed up to 20% of the loan amount for \nsubprojects that meet eligibility criteria, including safeguard requirements, \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness but no earlier than 12 months before the \nsigning of the loan agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between RDB and ADB. RDB will semiannually submit withdrawal \nrequests to ADB for the equivalent amount of the expected eligible subloans \nfrom micro and small enterprises for the coming 6 months. ADB will disburse \nthese advances to an RDB bank account. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, RDB = Regional Development Bank. \na  The  Department  of  Development  Finance,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Affairs,  will  be  the  implementing \nagency for the study on the effectiveness of government financial inclusion programs, which is funded under the \nattached technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n                                                \n28 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n22. \nThe attached technical assistance is an integral part of the project. It will support RDB\u2019s \ndeposit marketing campaign under output 1 (para. 16), the operational capacity development of \nRDB described under output 2 (para. 17), the training of women entrepreneurs described under \noutput 3 (para. 18), and a study on the effectiveness of Sri Lanka\u2019s efforts to promote financial \ninclusion (para. 14). The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1.0 million will be financed \non  a grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB  and  the \nremainder is in-kind contribution from RDB and the government. RDB will be the executing agency \nfor  all  TA  outputs  except  for  the  study  on  the  effectiveness  of  government  financial  inclusion \nprograms with an emphasis on women borrowers, which the Department of Development Finance \nof  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Affairs  will  implement.  RDB  and  the  government  will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nEconomically, the gains will come from (i) RDB\u2019s increased lending capacity to MSMEs \nand (ii) the project\u2019s requirements to lend to rural MSEs, which typically struggle to access the \nbanking system.30 There are also important positive externalities from this project\u2019s contribution \nto a well-capitalized banking system. \n \nFinancially, RDB is dependably profitable despite having a business model that focuses \n24. \non MSE lending, which carries higher nonperforming loan rates than lending to medium and large-\nsized enterprises, and an extensive branch network, which is central to RDB\u2019s mandate to serve \nrural areas. The attached TA will strengthen RDB\u2019s liquidity and market risk management. Capital \nis self-evidently weak, but the projected capital shortfall is the result of RDB\u2019s steady growth and \nBasel III\u2019s higher capital requirements and is not precipitated by financial losses.31 \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe overall integrity risk is low and the financial management risk is moderate. Integrity \ndue  diligence  was  carried  out,  and  its  risk  was  assessed  low.  Although  RDB\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  has  limitations,  such  as  cumbersome  loan  origination  and  evolving  risk \nmanagement, mitigations include (i) the capacity development for RDB under the attached TA, \n(ii) a robust project reporting system developed under the previous ADB projects in Sri Lanka, \nand (iii) RDB\u2019s satisfactory performance in those previous ADB projects. With these measures, \nthe over financial management arrangements are considered adequate. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and RDB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 27). \n \nC. \n \nPoverty  impact.  Although  Sri  Lanka  has  made  notable  progress  in  reducing  poverty, \n27. \nregional imbalances remain. MSMEs struggle to borrow because they often lack the real estate \n                                                \n30 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n\for financial assets that banks require as collateral. Therefore, the project targets rural MSEs that \ntypically face the greatest financial barriers. The project impact includes employment creation and \nincreased income, especially among the targeted MSEs. \n \nGender and social dimensions. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. \n28. \nIt builds on and complements similar approaches followed in previous projects, such as the SME \nLine of Credit Project (2016), the ongoing JFPR TA (2016), and related Women Entrepreneurs \nFinance  Initiative  (We-Fi)  Grant  and  TA  Project  (2018). 32  The  project  commits  to  women\u2019s \nempowerment and gender equity, including requirements for RDB to prepare a Board strategy to \nincrease outreach to underserved clients (including women), to lend to at least 500 MSEs led by \nwomen, and to train 500 women entrepreneurs to prepare a business plan.33 This emphasis is \nparticularly important given Sri Lanka\u2019s low women labor participation rate of 39%, which suggests \na large pool of untapped human resources for national economic development. \n \nD. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows:34 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nEnvironment  (category  FI).

During due diligence, site \nvisits  of  potential  subprojects  were  also  confirmed  category  C.  RDB  will  screen  subprojects \nagainst  the  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List,  and  a  shortlist  of  category  C  subprojects  will \nfurther guide subproject selection.35 To strengthen RDB\u2019s capacity in safeguards and enable it to \nfinance  subprojects that may  have safeguards impacts  in the future,  the  attached TA  will  help \nRDB establish and staff an environmental and social safeguards system. \n \n\n                                                \n32  ADB.
