THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Supporting the Credit Guarantee System for Economic Diversification and \nEmployment Project.1 The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \nSupporting the Credit Guarantee System for Economic Diversification and Employment Project, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  project  aims  to  improve  the  access  of  Mongolia\u2019s  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) to finance to sustain their businesses and thereby foster growth, diversify \nthe economy, lessen its dependence on the mining sector, and create jobs. The TA will improve \nthe  quality  of  the  Credit  Guarantee  Fund  of  Mongolia  (CGFM)  and  the  country\u2019s  credit \nguarantee system. The government has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support \ncommercial banks\u2019 lending to SMEs by backing CGFM credit guarantees.2 The project will \nexpand the financing for SMEs in sectors not related to mining. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development problems and opportunities. The mining sector accounts for about 25% \nof gross domestic product, and this makes the country highly vulnerable to swings in global \ncommodity  prices.  Although  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  make  up  90%  of \nregistered businesses and provide about 50% of all jobs, up to 90% of the country\u2019s 36,800 \nSMEs do not have regular access to finance from banks. This limits their chances to grow and \ntheir ability to make their full potential contribution to the economy and employment. Their \naccess to lending is impaired by their lack of currently recognized collateral, high rates on long-\nterm bank loans they need from banks, and the banks\u2019 own liquidity constraints on the long-term \nlending.3 Other issues are the country\u2019s inadequate credit information base, the burdensome \nrequirements SMEs face when applying for credit, the SMEs\u2019 poor understanding of financial \nmanagement, and underdeveloped loan underwriting capabilities at the banks.4  Two-thirds of \nSMEs  are  engaged  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  particularly  food  production,  followed  by \nconstruction materials and garments. With proper access to finance, SMEs, can help economic \ndiversification by increasing leather production, tourism, and other consumer services.  \n \n4.  SMEs  must  often  either  borrow  collateral  to  pledge  when  seeking  loans  or  get  no \nfinancing from banks for their investment needs and growth. Providing collateral is even more \nproblematic for SMEs run by women as their businesses tend to be smaller than those run by \nmen,  and therefore  have  fewer  pledgeable  assets.  Mongolia  has  an  ownership  and  liens\u2019 \nregister for immovable property but there is no system to secure interests on movable assets.5 \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The CGFM is a state-owned enterprise established in 2012. Members include the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry \nof Labor, the Ministry of Industry, the Financial Regulatory Commission, the National Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry, and the Mongolian Employers Federation. The government has provided all of the capital. As of year-end \n2014, CGFM had $3.1 million in assets. \n3 The term \u201clong-term\u201d or \u201clonger-term\u201d used in this document refers to loans with a 5-year maturity or longer. \n4 The Bank of Mongolia operates a credit registry. A credit information bureau established in 2009 by the Mongolian \nBankers Association with the support of the United States Agency for International Development is not operational. \n5 On 25 March 2014, the International Finance Corporation signed a cooperation agreement with the Ministry of \nJustice to reform the secured transaction system and to establish a proper legal framework for secured transactions \nthrough a new law on pledging, an online registry for movable property, and awareness raising and training for \nindustry professionals. ", "2  \nThis  generally  limits  the  collateral  accepted  by  banks  to  real  estate.  Weak  standards  for \nappraising assets reduce the credibility of these valuations of collateral. SMEs need loans on \nterms longer than those now available for their capital investments, but the banks do not have \nthe  matching  long-term  funding  sources  to  lend  with  those  maturities  due  in  part  to  an \nunderdeveloped long-term deposit market. To match their short-term deposits, banks mainly \nmake only short-term loans to SMEs. They also try to make these loans in US dollars to help \nbalance their open foreign currency positions. Foreign currency loan rates are also lower than \nthe annual 16% rates generally available for local currency loans, and the rates of 22%\u201326% \navailable to SMEs. This ignores the inability of most SMEs to generate enough foreign currency \nto repay these loans. As a result, the national chamber of commerce and industry has reported \na rising number of SME bankruptcies brought on by having to service loans in US dollars.  \n \n5.  The government established the CGFM in November 2012 to help SMEs overcome the \nobstacles posed by collateral issues to gaining finance. Operations began in April 2013, and 10 \nof the country\u2019s 13 banks now participate in the program, along with 6 nonbank financial \ninstitutions. Its overall effect on the economy has been limited as the fund\u2019s potential impact is \nheld back by its size, having only one basic guarantee product, and a lack of operational \ncapacity and expertise. SMEs are not using credit guarantees as much as they could for several \nreasons. Many potential borrowers are unaware of the program, and the CGFM marketing is \nweak. SMEs also lack financial management knowledge needed to apply for loans. While the \nCGFM can support SME access to finance by offering guarantees, no law specifically governs \nthe operations of a private guarantee system offering an alternative to the government-run \nCGFM. Despite the barriers, on average each guarantee issued has helped SMEs create jobs. \n \n6.  Government plans and linkage with country partnership strategy. The project is \nconsistent with Mongolia\u2019s national development strategy, which is based on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and with an SME development program the government has adopted for \n2014\u20132016.6 It is in line with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Mongolia for 2014\u2013\n2016,  which  made  development  of  the  finance  sector  a  new  priority.7  Finance  sector \ndevelopment was reconfirmed as one of ADB\u2019s core areas of operation by the 2014 Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020.8 The project will build on previous and ongoing ADB lending programs \nthat included support for strengthening financial regulation and governance, expanding access \nto credit, enhancing the role of the nonbank finance sector, and increasing the availability of \nsavings and credit services in rural areas and among the poor.9 The project is an extension of \nADB\u2019s  SME  onlending  programs,10  as  well  as  its  TA  work  in  microfinance,  mobile  and \nbranchless banking, and regulatory and supervisory frameworks.11 \n                                                \n6 Government of  Mongolia.  2008.

Among Mongolia\u2019s development partners, only \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has  provided  the  CGFM  with  support.  It  has \nprovided limited periodic training and has proposed placing a volunteer credit guarantee expert \nat  the  fund.  Development  partner  assistance  in  the  SME  sector  has  focused  mainly  on \nsupporting SME capacity development and providing financing for private enterprises with no or \nlimited access to finance. Much of this assistance has been aimed at lowering the high cost of \nloans by offering SMEs concessional rates. It has not addressed the issues related to the SMEs\u2019 \ninability to provide collateral currently acceptable to the banks from which they seek loans or the \nlack of availability from banks of long-term funding because their deposit base is only under 1 \nyear. Despite an increasing number of development partners active in SME development and \nfinancing, programs have shown that these issues and limited access to affordable long-term \nfinance continue to constrain SME growth.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be increased job creation in economic sectors not related to mining. The \noutcome will be an expansion of access to finance for SMEs.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  Output  1:  Longer-term  financing  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \nincreased.  Up  to  $60 million  of  ADB funding  will  be  made  available  under the  proposed \nfinancial intermediation loan to enable participating financial institutions (PFIs) to make long-\nterm loans denominated in local currency to SMEs for eligible subprojects. In addition, the \nproject will back the introduction of new guarantee products by the CGFM to support up to $432 \nmillion of SME subprojects. This is expected to create as many as 13,200 jobs over the 18-year \nADB loan period.12 Output 1 will be delivered by (i) helping PFIs mitigate maturity mismatches \nby making time deposits in PFIs to fund a portion of their loans to qualified SME borrowers, and \n(ii) CGFM guarantees for a portion of the credit risk these loans pose. New credit guarantee \nproducts designed to help low-income groups in rural areas and women entrepreneurs access \nthe credit guarantee will be established.13 The CGFM will carry out awareness-raising and \noutreach programs to make women and the rural poor aware of the credit guarantee system. \n \n10.  Output 2: A longer-term bank deposit market developed. The funding from the local \ncurrency time deposits placed by the CGFM in the PFIs will help establish a market for 5-year \ndeposits, since it will build confidence in the safety and pricing of local currency deposits and \nencourage the private sector to mobilize savings for lending with longer maturities. CGFM will \nuse market-based rates for time deposits consistent with existing funding from the government, \n                                                                                                                                                       \nTechnical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Policy  and  Institutional  Support  for  Banking  Sector  Systemic  Risk \nManagement. Manila (TA 7397-MON). \n12 According to regulation, CGFM may issue guarantees totaling a maximum value of 10 times its capital base. It is \nprojected that the capital base can reach $9 million, reflecting current capital and proposed additional government \ninjection and thereby allowing for $90 million of guarantees to be issued.  Assuming that PFIs will lend only 75% of \nthe borrowing SMEs\u2019 total project costs, $90 million in guarantees could support $120 million of SME subprojects at \none time, before considering recycling. Economic analysis shows that 13,200 jobs may be created and loan funds \nmay be recycled 3.6 times during the project. This would support $432 million in SME subprojects. As of 30 June \n2015, the CGFM had issued 364 guarantees for MNT24.4 billion supporting MNT59.7 billion of gross loans, with an \naverage 43-month tenor. These guarantees created 1,210 new jobs. PFIs will include commercial banks only. \n13 This project defines women-run businesses as businesses that meet at least one of three criteria\u2014i.e., that (i) at \nleast 50% of ownership is controlled by women, (ii) at least 60% of senior managers are women, or (iii) at least \n50% of the registered contractual employees are women.

The CGFM time deposits in \nPFIs will require the CGFM to issue new guarantee products, such as guarantees targeting \nwomen entrepreneurs, rural-based SMEs, and SMEs that will create non-mining sector jobs, to \nsupport loans to qualified SME borrowers. The loan repayments will be recycled during the term \nof the ADB loan to support new SME loans. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $90 million (Table 1). The government has requested a \nloan of $60 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. Project \nfinancing (Table 2) reflects sources contributed by PFIs from the private sector and the CGFM \nto partially fund credit-guaranteed SME subprojects in addition to the ADB loan. The loan will \nhave an 18-year term, including a grace period of 12 years, an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during implementation to \nbe capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject  agreements.14  The  loan  will  have  principal  repayments  in  regular  semiannual \ninstallments over the last 6 years of the loan, and interest will be repaid semiannually with \ninterest and commitment fees capitalized up to the allocation amount in Table 1.15 All payment \nand repayment obligations of Mongolia under the ADB loan are independent of the performance \nof the CGFM under the subsidiary loan agreement (SLA) with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), of \nPFIs under the relevant time deposit agreements, of SME borrowers under the relevant SME \nloan agreements, as well as of  any conversion or hedging risk borne by  Mongolia in the \nconversions of the ADB loan into tugrik or reconversion to US dollars.    \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n ($ million) \nItem  Total \nA.

Commitment charges for an OCR loan are 0.15% per \nyear to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n14 Interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points. This is based on the loan terms and the government\u2019s \nchoice of repayment option and dates. \n15 A 12-year grace period is necessary to allow the CGFM to recycle ADB loan proceeds approximately 3.6 times \nduring its 18-year term. This will be done by supporting the placement of new, recurring time deposits linked to \nguarantees issued for new loans to qualified SME borrowers. The grace period will also enable the project to \nsupport long-term SME loans for capital investments. Interest and commitment fees will be capitalized up to the \nallocation amount to allow for the retention of profits by the CGFM due to lower initial financing charges that will \nsupport the buildup of the capital base and give the fund additional capacity to issue guarantees through leverage.

The MOF will be the executing agency, and the CGFM will be the implementing agency. \nADB loan proceeds will be drawn down by the MOF from the imprest account, based on the \nestimate of the amount of the time deposits the CGFM is to place with PFIs during the next 6 \nmonths.16 ADB loan proceeds are expected to be fully drawn down by the end of the 5-year \nimplementation period and possibly sooner, depending on how quickly the CGFM issues new \nguarantees. Upon receipt of the ADB loan proceeds through periodic drawdowns, the MOF will \nconvert the proceeds into tugrik and relend the converted amount to the CGFM under an SLA \nthat is satisfactory to ADB.17 Upon receipt, the CGFM will immediately deposit these funds into a \nsubaccount that will be used to place time deposits in the PFIs that meet the selection criteria \nagreed by the MOF, the CGFM, and ADB, and have received guarantees from the CGFM for \nSME  loans  for  eligible  subprojects.  Time  deposit  and  guarantee  agreements  between  the \nCGFM and PFIs will be approved by ADB. Each PFI will use the time deposit proceeds and \nguarantees received to issue new market-based, floating, or fixed-rate tugrik loans, leases, and \nother forms of finance to eligible SMEs for eligible subprojects. When the time deposits mature, \nthe proceeds will be deposited in an escrow account under the name of the CGFM at a PFI \napproved by ADB for recycling into new time deposits.18 \n \n                                                \n16 The volume of time deposits placed in a PFI will be linked to the level of the guarantees the CGFM issues for loans \nto eligible SME borrowers by the PFI. Only loans to eligible SME borrowers that use new CGFM guarantee \nproducts will be eligible to receive partial ADB loan funding. Time deposits will be placed in PFIs at maturities equal \nto the principal amortization schedule of the underlying portfolio of SME loans in annual maturity increments until \nthe level of the guarantees the CGFM issued for loans to eligible SME borrowers by each PFI to SMEs is reached.  \nTime deposits have maturities of up to 5 years. If the principal amortization schedule for the portfolio of SME loans \nreflects tenors of longer than 5 years, all remaining amortizations beyond 5 years will be combined into a 5-year \ntime deposit and then, at the 5-year maturity, the time deposits will be rolled over into new time deposits to cover \nthe remaining portfolio amortization schedule through the final maturity of the portfolio of SME loans, as described \nin the project administration manual (PAM). Cofunding from the CGFM will be placed in PFIs on the same terms \nand conditions as deposits using ADB loan funds. Time deposits placed by the CGFM in PFIs will pay a market-\nbased rate in line with the government and other development agencies\u2019 loan financing programs, as determined \nby ADB from time to time and detailed in the PAM. The initial rate will be set by ADB and, after 3 years, be reset by \nADB in line with the government and other development agencies' loan financing programs. \n17 For the first 3 years of the ADB loan, MOF will charge the CGFM an interest rate of up to 1% on the balance of the \nADB loan disbursed to the CGFM in tugrik in the SLA. After year 3, MOF may charge CGFM under the SLA on the \ndisbursed ADB loan balance a maximum of the pass-through rate of interest charged by ADB, plus up to 0.5%.  \nMOF may additionally charge CGFM under the SLA up to 0.15% on the undisbursed balance of the ADB loan. The \nrepayment period of the SLA will be consistent with the ADB loan. \n18 The interest rate on escrow account balances will be at market rates with a maturity of no more than 1 month. \n ", "6  \n13.  Qualified participating financial institutions. To be eligible to participate, each PFI \nmust: (i) be deemed by ADB as having satisfactory operations for at least 5 years; (ii) submit \ndocumentation establishing at least 5 years of experience in SME or microcredit lending; (iii) \ndemonstrate to ADB its track record of running a successful SME program; (iv) have corporate, \nfinancial, and governance practices that are acceptable to ADB; (v) have adequate credit and \nrisk management policies, and operating systems acceptable to ADB; (vi) have satisfactory and \ntransparent  accounting,  management  information  system,  and  internal  audit  system  as \ndetermined by ADB; (vii) satisfy ADB\u2019s due diligence requirements for integrity, antimoney \nlaundering,  and  counterfinancing  of terrorism, and  put  in  place  antimoney  laundering,  and \ncounterfinancing of terrorism controls, and measures to implement such controls, in each case \nacceptable to ADB; (viii) establish an environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nacceptable to ADB, and appoint qualified staff to implement the ESMS for screening prospective \nqualified SME subprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nthe requirements set forth in the project administration manual (PAM) to the satisfaction of ADB; \nand (ix) obtain relevant approvals for new CGFM guarantee products for SME loans that will be \nprovided  to qualified  SME  borrowers for qualified  SME  subprojects,  and  sign the relevant \nmaster guarantee agreement, approved by ADB.19   \n \n14.  In addition, each PFI will need to meet other eligibility criteria at all times. It must (i) \ncomply fully with capital adequacy ratios and all other prudential requirements mandated by the  \nBank of Mongolia; (ii) have loans overdue by 90 days or more comprising less than 8% of its \ntotal loan portfolio; (iii) have operating profit after tax in its most recently completed fiscal year; \nand (iv) have its financial accounts audited annually by an external auditor, with its audit results \ndetermined satisfactory by ADB. PFIs that do not meet all eligibility criteria at selection may still \nparticipate if they agree to implement measures to achieve full compliance within 12 months of \nsigning the master guarantee agreement with the CGFM. If a PFI does not fully comply within \n12 months of this signing, it will not be permitted to participate in the project. The CGFM will \nnotify  ADB  of  this  promptly  and  exercise  its  rights  under the  time  deposit  and  guarantee \nagreements in consultation with ADB.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months and is expected to start by 31 March 2016 \nand to be completed by 31 March 2018. The quality of the CGFM and the credit guarantee \nsystem will be improved and the TA will build operational, governance, and risk management \ncapacity at the CGFM and enhance its product set. It will help reform the credit guarantee \nsystem framework by drafting laws and regulations to enable a private credit guarantee system \nto  develop.  The  CGFM\u2019s  legal  framework  will  be  reviewed  under  the  TA  to  strengthen \ngovernance mechanisms and support public transparency. The MOF will be the executing \nagency. ADB will consider the current and planned activities of other development partners \nwhen finalizing the arrangements for the TA.21 The TA will use a road map created by the \nproject preparatory TA.22 The TA is estimated to cost $0.83 million, of which $0.80 million will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).23  TA \nconsultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). TA resources will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n18.  Due diligence found the project to be financially viable, economically sustainable, and in \ncompliance with Mongolia\u2019s laws. It supports social and gender development, and incorporates \nenvironmental safeguards. \n \n                                                \n21 The Japan International Cooperation Agency has been implementing a two-step loan project since 2012 to provide \nlending and capacity development to PFIs supporting SMEs and also supports the CGFM (para. 7). \n22 ADB provided project preparatory TA to Mongolia for Supporting the Credit Guarantee System for Economic \nDiversification and Employment Project (TA 8792). \n23  Under P48015-003. \n ", "8  \nA.  Economic and Financial \n19.  The  key  economic  benefit  is  job  creation.  The  project  is  economically  viable.  Its \nestimated economic internal rate of return of 21.1% exceeds the 12.0% economic opportunity \ncapital  cost.  Sensitivity  analysis  tested  the  robustness  of  economic  viability  under  three \nscenarios: a reduction in the projected jobs to be created per guarantee issued, a reduction in \nthe envisioned incremental wage gains, and a 1-year delay in project start. The testing resulted \nin economic internal rates of return of 15.7%\u201320.4%, confirming viability. Financial due diligence \nshowed that the CGFM met all loan covenants. The CGFM\u2019s financial capacity was subjected to \nsensitivity analysis to assess its ability to meet equity requirements and the cofinancing ratio in \nthe event of adverse changes in the growth rate in guarantee issuance, the fees charged for \nguarantees, and the ratio of nonperforming loans. The analysis showed that the CGFM can \ncomply with loan covenants during the ADB loan term under all scenarios.24  \n \nB.  Governance \n20.  Credit Guarantee Fund of Mongolia. An assessment established that the CGFM has \nthe ability to manage the project financially.25 ADB will have approval of the CGFM\u2019s selection of \na PIU staff that has suitable skills and is familiar with the government and ADB requirements on \ndisbursements  and  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  Adequate  financial  management \ncontrols are in place, but financial management practices require some strengthening (footnote \n25). These  are  its  legal  framework, governance, financial  management,  risk management, \ninformation systems, and SME educational program. The CGFM needs to enhance its financial \nmanagement reporting tools and reports and its long-term budgeting, as well as budget links to \nstrategic  objectives.  Risk  management  should  be  reinforced,  and  better  regulatory  and \noperational risk policies drafted. The CGFM credit guarantee assessment and portfolio analysis \nskills  require  improvement.  Due  diligence  rated  the  premitigation  risk  moderate,  and  the \nconcerns identified will be addressed through the associated TA during project implementation \n(para. 17). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the MOF and the CGFM. The policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \n21.  Participating financial institutions. Due diligence was carried out for all 10 candidate \nPFIs that submitted expressions of interest.26 ADB reviewed the PFIs\u2019 credit, operational, and \ncounterparty risks, as well as their risk mitigation processes. Seven of these PFIs met all of the \neligibility  criteria  (paras.  13-14).27  The  three  PFI  candidates  that  did  not  qualify  may  still \nparticipate if they agree to implement measures to meet all criteria within a reasonable period. \nShortcomings in PFIs related to social, gender, and environmental safeguards will be addressed \nthrough the training to be provided under the TA. The CGFM will monitor the PFIs to ensure that \nSME loans finance activities that are consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nother loan qualification criteria, including ADB\u2019s extended prohibited investment activities list. \nAuditing  procedures  will  meet  ADB  requirements.  The  CGFM  will  prepare  annual  audited \nconsolidated statements on the use of funds by the PFIs and will provide ADB with quarterly \nstatements to show that the ADB loan funds are used for the purposes intended by the project. \n \n                                                \n24 Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 A detailed diagnostic report, recommendations, and a road map are contained in Due Diligence of Credit \nGuarantee Fund of Mongolia and Road Map (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions and Due Diligence Reports of Participating Financial \nInstitutions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Full details of PFI due diligence results can be found in Financial Analysis and Due  Diligence Reports of \nParticipating Financial Institutions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n22.  Ministry  of  Finance.  Financial  management  assessments  for  ADB-funded  projects \nhave judged the MOF to be able to act as an executing agency.28 Due diligence for this project \nestablished that the MOF has sufficient financial management capabilities and is familiar with \nADB requirements on disbursements and social and environmental safeguards. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n23.  Socioeconomic and gender impacts. The project will not have a direct  effect on \nincome growth or poverty reduction, but it will create jobs and its indirect impacts on living \nstandards and the well-being of the Mongolian population will be substantial. As the project will \nimprove access to finance for SME entrepreneurs who are likely to include women, as well as \nemployment opportunities for women in the SME sector, the project\u2019s proposed gender category \nis some gender elements. The project steering committee and the PIU will ensure that the \nprinciples of gender equity aimed at increasing benefits for women are consistent with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998) and are followed during project implementation. The \nexpected economic, social, and gender impacts are described in detail in the PAM. Action will \nbe taken to ensure that SMEs benefiting from loans comply with national labor standards. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n24.  The project will help put arrangements into place at the MOF, the CGFM, and the PFIs \nto ensure that the loans qualified SME borrowers will comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement; Mongolia\u2019s labor, environmental, health, safety, and social laws and regulations; and \nthe  restrictions  of  the  extended  prohibited  investment  activities  list.29  Before  the  first \ndisbursement of the ADB loan, the CGFM will be required to establish an ESMS acceptable to \nADB and appoint qualified officers to implement it. The ESMS will be used to screen and \ncategorize the potential environmental, indigenous peoples, or involuntary resettlement impacts \nof any proposed SME subproject before it is approved for a credit guarantee.  \n \n25.  Social safeguards. The project is classified FI and treated as category C for involuntary \nresettlement and for indigenous peoples impacts under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nProject activities will affect no ethnic minority communities or indigenous peoples nor involve \ninvoluntary resettlement. No proposed subproject that can be classified as category A or B for \ninvoluntary resettlement or indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards will be approved. \n \n26.  Environment. The project is classified FI and treated as category B for environment. \nThe project will have mainly positive environmental benefits, since the support it will provide for \nSMEs will be closely screened to eliminate potential adverse environmental impacts and will \nhelp diversify the economy away from overdependence on mining-related activities, which often \nhave negative effects on the environment. An ESMS was prepared for the PFIs that includes \nelements  of  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework.  The  PFIs  will  use  the \nframework  for  due  diligence  to  establish  whether  proposed  subprojects  meet  Mongolia\u2019s \nenvironmental protection and environmental impact assessment laws, and the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The ESMS screening procedures include a brief climate risk \nassessment that will be applied to every subproject. Based on the proposed loan activities, no \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected,  and  risk  is  considered  low.  Only \nsubprojects treated as category B or C for environment will be supported by the PFIs under \nADB\u2019s project and loan. The potential impacts of any category B subprojects will be mitigated \n                                                \n28 ADB. 2015.
