I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  for  an  equity \ninvestment of up to $2,750,000, or 25% of the issued share capital, in the holding company1 of \nFoundation Power Company Daharki Limited, whichever is lower; and a guarantee in a principal \namount of up to $44,000,000 plus interest, in favor of the lenders to the holding company; in \neach case for developing the Daharki 171MW combined cycle gas fired power plant (Daharki \nPower or the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE, SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  Pakistan faces an acute shortage of power. In addition, private investment in the power \nsector  is  hampered  e.g.  by  concerns  over  investment  returns  and  previous  Government \nattempts to reduce tariffs agreed with independent power producers (IPPs). As a result, scarce \nindigenous fuel resources that could be used for power generation are lying idle, and much-\nneeded increases in generation capacity are delayed. The  Project will play an important part in \naddressing these issues, both in its own right and as an example for others. \n \n3.  ADB has worked closely with the Government\u2019s Private Power and Infrastructure Board \n(PPIB) to identify which of several power projects being considered would benefit most from \nassistance provided via ADB\u2019s non-sovereign financing window and match ADB\u2019s priorities for \npower and private sector development in Pakistan. Given the excellent working relationship \nbetween Fauji Foundation and ADB in three previous projects,2 Fauji Foundation asked ADB to \ninvest in the Project. The Project received concept clearance in February 20073 and a mandate \nagreement was signed in March 2007. Due diligence missions were fielded in March and June \n2007. \n \nA.  Electricity Demand\u2013Supply Gap \n4.  Despite wide-ranging power sector reforms, Pakistan has one of the lowest levels of per-\ncapita  power  consumption  in  the  world  (413kWh).  This  compares  with  497kWh  in  the \nPhilippines  and  1,414kWh  in  Thailand.  Only  55%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  has  access  to \nelectricity from the national grid. The remainder of the population uses kerosene, wood, and \nother bio-fuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. A growing population and a thriving economy \nmean  that  demand  for  electricity  is  always  accelerating.  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  consumption \nincreased at a compound average growth rate of 6.8% from 2001 to 2006, with faster rates of \ngrowth among residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial users. The average annual \ngrowth in electricity demand, at 8.3% per annum, exceeds recent economic growth rates of \nabout  6%.  Continued  strong  economic  growth  is  expected  to  increase  annual  per  capita \nconsumption of electricity (see Appendix 2 for further details on Pakistan\u2019s power sector). \n \n                                                 \n1  To be registered in a jurisdiction acceptable to ADB. \n2  ADB. 1989.

However, the supply of power has not kept pace with demand. Total current installed \npower generating capacity in Pakistan amounts to 19,450MW, resulting in a capacity shortfall of \n428MW by the end of 2006 and 1,329MW in 2007. To cope with expected growth in electricity \ndemand, it is estimated that Pakistan will need to add about 2,000MW of new capacity each \nyear to avoid power shortages. Without this addition, there could be a supply shortfall of 15% \nwithin 2 years (Table 1). The country is already experiencing severe disruptions in power supply, \nwhich are expected to worsen. Measures to ration consumption are already being taken, such \nas forcing shops and industries to close early. Such measures will have a direct negative effect \non economic growth. \n \nTable 1: Power Demand and Supply Projections, 2006\u20132010 \n(MW) \n \nDemand- Gap as % \nTotal  Firm  Supply  of \nYear  Domestic  Commercial  Agriculture  Industrial  Others  Demand  Supplya  Gap  Demand \n2006  7,199  1,216  1,763  5,891  1,035  15,500  15,072  428  0 \n2007  7,585  1,251  1,820  6,481  1,086  16,600  15,271  1,329  8 \n2008  8,127  1,312  1,893  7,252  1,159  17,900  15,688  2,212  12 \n2009  8,737  1,354  1,979  8,181  1,243  19,600  16,704  2,896  15 \n2010  9,531  1,408  2,079  9,267  1,341  21,500  18,584  2,916  14 \nMW = megawatt. \na Present generation plus planned additions. \nSources: Planning Commission and Private Power Infrastructure Board, Government of Pakistan. 2006. \n \nB.  Lack of Indigenous Resources for Power Generation \n6.  Diesel or furnace oil-fueled generation plants are the easiest and quickest power plants \nto commission because both types of fuel are available on international markets and can be \nimported. However, reliance on imported diesel or furnace oil increases dependence on external \nsupplies, adds to the generation cost (compared with hydropower and gas), and has significant \nenvironmental impacts. The Government\u2019s Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF), \n2005\u20132010 has therefore identified low-cost energy generation through indigenous resources \n(gas, hydropower, wind and coal) as a key method of increasing power generation in Pakistan. \n \n7.  However,  because  extraction  of  Pakistan\u2019s  significant  domestic  coal  resources  is \ncomplex and at an early stage, domestic coal-fired power generation is considered to be up to a \ndecade away. Wind power can supply only a limited amount of future electricity generation, \nleaving hydropower and gas as the mainstays of domestic energy resources.  \n \n8.  Hydropower,  which  currently  represents  about  6,499MW  (33.4%)  of  total  installed \ngeneration capacity in Pakistan (almost all of it in the public sector), is the main indigenous \nfuture source of energy, with over 30 projects in the pipeline. Nevertheless, the lead time for \ndevelopment, the often complicated and controversial cross-border water usage agreements, \nand the political, social, and environmental impacts of large dams, push additional large-scale \nhydropower generation potential well into the future, 2012\u20132015 at the earliest (Figure 1).  \n \n ", "  3\nFigure 1: Cumulative Planned Hydropower Generation Capacity Additions, 2007\u20132020 \n(MW) \n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n-\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n \n    MW = megawatt. \n    Sources: Government of Pakistan\u2019s Least-Cost Generation Plan and Asian Development Bank analysis. \n \n \n9.  While some 75% of current thermal power generation in Pakistan is based on natural \ngas, any new gas fired-power generation is constrained by the limited remaining domestic gas \nresources. Pakistan\u2019s major gas field, Sui, from which gas is piped to all major cities and to \nexisting gas-fired power plants and industries, is about 70% depleted, and at current utilization \nrates gas availability cannot be guaranteed beyond 2011. This severely limits the potential for \nnew  power  plants  using  Sui  gas.  In  the  private  sector,  most  planned  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs) that will begin by firing on gas are expected to switch to diesel or fuel oil once \nthe gas runs out, which will increase the cost of generation, raise tariffs, and have negative \nenvironmental impacts. While importation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is seen as medium-\nterm way of diversifying the fuel mix, and an LNG import terminal is being planned near Karachi, \nthe transportation costs of the LNG will also add to generation costs.  \n \n10.  The discovery of a deep well in Pakistan\u2019s second largest gas field, the Mari gas field, \nnear the city of Sukkur in Sindh province, has made it possible to plan for additional gas-fired \npower supply. The Mari gas has relatively low energy content (measured in British thermal units \n[BTUs]),  which  makes  it  unsuitable  or  uneconomic  for  most  purposes,  except  for  power \ngeneration (since turbines can be configured to run on low-BTU gas). Two plants have been \nplanned: Daharki Power, which is the subject of this financing, and the 134MW Star Power plant, \nwhich is also under preparation. Until these plants are operational, this gas will continue to lie \nidle.4 \n \nC.  Private Sector Involvement in Power Generation in Pakistan \n11.  The Government recognizes the benefits of encouraging private sector participation in \nthe power sector, both through privatization of state-owned entities and through enabling the \nprivate sector to undertake greenfield power generation. The Government has issued private-\nsector-friendly  policies  on  thermal  power  generation,  in  1994,  1998,  and  2002,  and  on \nhydropower  generation  in  1995  and  2002.  These  policies  were  designed  to  create  the \nconditions to encourage the private sector to construct, own, and operate power generation and \ntransmission assets. To facilitate such investments, the PPIB was created in 1994 under the \nMinistry of Water and Power. As a result of the Ministry of Water and Power\u2019s efforts, a number \nof IPPs were commissioned under build-own-operate (BOO) arrangements in the late 1990s, \nand about 30% of the country\u2019s thermal capacity is now owned and operated by the private \n                                                 \n4 Daharki Power is the more advanced of the two and the sponsors of Star Power are closely monitoring its progress. \n ", "4       \nsector. One of these projects, the Fauji-Foundation-led 151MW Fauji Kabirwala gas-fired power \nplant (Fauji Kabirwala), was set up under the first private power policy of 1994 and received \nADB nonsovereign financing (footnote 2). \n \n1.  Mixed Results in Implementing Policies \n12.  However, during the late 1990s and early years of the new millennium, the Government \nattempted to lower tariffs previously agreed with the early IPPs, in order to reduce the amount of \ngovernment  finance  allocated  to  the  purchase  of  electricity.  This  was  driven  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s inability to meet its general financial obligations. This conflict effectively halted \nthe development and implementation of further IPPs. After a delay of about 7 years with no new \ninvestment in IPPs, the Government embarked on a renewed initiative to promote private sector \ninvestment  in  infrastructure,  especially  in  power  generation  (and  resolved  its  previous \ndifferences with the earlier IPPs). This approach also reflected the development priorities set out \nin Pakistan\u2019s Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF). The revised power policy of 2002 \n(the 2002 policy) was designed to address issues raised by existing and potential investors.   \n \n2.  Key Investor Issues \n13.  Notwithstanding the Government\u2019s efforts, impediments to IPP development remain (and \nalmost all planned new IPPs have been badly stalled). A key issue is the question of adequate \ninvestment returns for the risk taken. A recent analytical news piece explicitly pointed out that \n\u201cIn the private sector, potential investors have been put off by the unrealistically low tariff offered \nby [the Water and Power Development Authority] WAPDA\u201d.5 WAPDA, or more specifically its  \nunbundled transmission and distribution company, the National Transmission and Dispatch \nCorporation (NTDC), is the state-owned power off-taker for all of Pakistan (except Karachi). \n \n14.  Under the 2002 policy, the tariff paid by NTDC to the IPPs includes a component \nreflecting a return on the equity invested. This return component is determined by the National \nElectric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). In recent tariff determinations (e.g., for Orient \nPower in December 2005, Saif Power in June 2006, and ARL Power in November 2006), \nNEPRA has allowed a rate of return on equity in Pakistan rupee terms of 15%. This rate is  \n(i) significantly lower than the returns offered under 1994 policy, which ranged from 17% to 19%; \nand (ii) lower than the returns that can be currently achieved in other types of general equity \ninvestments.  In  view  of  these  lower-than-expected  returns,  potential  investors,  particularly \ninternational investors, have, to a large degree, opted out of investing further in IPPs in Pakistan. \nFor  example,  Globeleq,  a  major  investor  in  power  plants  in  developing  countries,  was \napproached in 2006 with regard to both Daharki Power and Orient Power, but did not invest in \neither, as the projected returns were below its corporate hurdle rate for equity investments. \n \n15.  Another impediment is the potential sharing of interest cost savings. Under the same \n2002 policy tariff regime, the interest cost is passed straight on by the investor to the power \npurchaser. Any savings achieved by the investors, either through a refinancing once the project \nis completed, or through upfront negotiations with the finance providers (commercial banks), are \nalso  passed  straight  through.  While  this  is  intended  to  benefit  the  Government  and  the \nconsumers, because it is not shared with the investors or project developers, it offers no \nincentive for investors to negotiate with lenders to obtain the lowest cost of financing possible. \n                                                 \n5 Husain, Irfan. 2007. A Dark Future. Khaleej Times. Karachi (5 July). \n ", "  5\nThe full pass-through of savings is therefore somewhat counter-productive. This has been \nrecognized by both NEPRA and PPIB, but the issue has not yet been resolved.6  \n \n16.  Such issues continue to hamper IPP negotiations, with the result that IPPs totaling over \n600MW that were expected to have reached financial close by now (and thus would have been \nable to start construction) have been delayed. Overall, projects in the pipeline totaling over \n1,400MW are experiencing delays. Only one of the five IPPs that were in PPIB\u2019s pipeline in \nMarch 2006 and were expected to have been closed and begun construction by now has \nactually done so (Orient Power, a 225MW oil/gas-fired plant), and only after significant delays, \nlargely because of investor reluctance over returns. Meanwhile, in the other projects, including \nDaharki Power, investors have been looking at other ways of improving equity returns. During \nsuch delays, consumers are deprived of potential additional electricity, which negatively impacts \neconomic growth and development. The holding company structure proposed for the Project will \nhelp to address these concerns about investor returns. \n \nD.  ADB\u2019s Operations in the Power Sector in Pakistan \n3.  Public Sector   \n17.  ADB is the major source of external investment in the energy sector in Pakistan, having \nprovided about one third of the total finance from external sources. WAPDA has been the \nlargest borrower, receiving $1.575 billion in 13 public sector loans. The remainder of ADB\u2019s \npublic sector financing was to the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) before it was \nprivatized (these loans were primarily for generation expansion projects and to a lesser degree \nfor  transmission  and  distribution  upgrades,  as  well  as  for  privatization).  ADB\u2019s  nonlending \nactivities have provided a total of $14.2 million for 27 technical assistance (TA) projects. The \nprojects have covered tariff rationalization and integration, management information systems, \npower generation coordination, thermal power plant maintenance, institutional strengthening \nand restructuring, and privatization. ADB has worked closely with the Government on a road \nmap for change in the power sector. Based on this road map, ADB\u2019s indicative public sector \nprogram for power could reach $1.5 billion during 2006\u20132009 (Appendix 3).  \n \n4.  Private Sector  \n18.  ADB has also been closely involved in the power sector in Pakistan through its Private \nSector Operations Department (Appendix 4). It has made loans and investments to Fauji Oil \nTerminal Company, an oil terminal with a handling capacity of over 10 million tons of fuel oil and \nhigh-speed diesel (footnote 2); Fauji Kabirwala, one of the first IPPs under the 1994 power \npolicy (footnote 2); and the New Bong Escape Project, an 84MW run-of-the-river hydropower \nplant  and  the  first  hydropower  IPP  in  Pakistan  under  the  1995  hydropower  policy.7 Most \nrecently, ADB approved a $150 million loan to KESC for its post-privatization rehabilitation, \nupgrade,  and  expansion.  Support  for  further  energy-related  projects,  especially  using \nindigenous resources, is envisaged as a key component of ADB\u2019s near-term Pakistan non-\nsovereign operations.  \n                                                 \n6 Both NEPRA and PPIB claim that a decision has been taken to share interest cost savings between investors on \nthe one hand and the Government and consumers on the other. NEPRA and PPIB agree that this should be divided  \nin the ratio of 60:40, but differ on whether the investors or the Government and consumers should receive the 60% \nshare. \n7 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Laraib \nEnergy Limited for the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Manila. \n ", "6       \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  that  Pakistan\u2019s  power  consumers  will  receive \nadditional low-cost power, generated from local gas with no other economic use, and adequate \nreturn for the Project\u2019s investors. Specifically, the Project will have the following impacts:  \n \n(i)  Narrowing the Electricity Demand-Supply gap. The Project will increase net \nelectricity generation capacity by some 171MW (about 13% of Pakistan\u2019s current \ndemand\u2013supply gap). As a base-load plant, it will contribute to more than this \nshare in terms of actual electricity output. This will help reduce the constraints on \neconomic growth caused by power shortages. \n \n(ii)  Promoting efficient management of natural resources. The low-cost, low-\nBTU domestic gas has no other economic application, and its use by the Project, \nwill  have  several  positive  economic  effects.  First  and  most  important,  it  will \nexploit an otherwise idle resource. Second, it will enable low-cost generation \nthrough lower transportation costs (as the plant will be built near the gas field). \nThis gives the Project an advantage over imported LNG or other types of fuel and \npiped gas from the Sui field. Third, it will help reduce Pakistan\u2019s exposure to \nvolatile international oil prices through continued imports of fuel oil and diesel, the \nonly viable short-term alternatives to gas as fuel for power generation. \n \n(iii)  Supporting  private  sector  investment.  To  sustain  Pakistan\u2019s  current  high \neconomic growth rates, the MTDF estimates that 7\u20138% of annual GDP (about \n$81 billion between 2005 and 2010) needs to be invested in infrastructure. Of this, \nthe Government is able to invest only about 1.5%. The Government (with ADB\u2019s \nstrong  support)  has  been  implementing  reforms  to  encourage  public  private \npartnerships for the provision of infrastructure. It is of paramount importance that \nthe private sector is supported and encouraged to invest in IPPs. As the first gas-\nfired IPP to reach financial closure under the 2002 policy, the Project will set a \nbenchmark for other IPPs and encourage domestic and international investors to \nagain look at power generation as an attractive investment opportunity. \n \nB.  Project Description \n1.  Overview and Timeline \n20.  The Project consists of a 171MW combined cycle low-BTU gas-fired power plant in \nDaharki, District Ghotki, Sindh province, in Pakistan. It is expected to be a base load plant with \n100% dispatch because of its low-cost tariff. The sponsor, the Fauji Foundation, received a \nLetter of Interest to develop the Project using a BOO structure under the 2002 policy from the \nPPIB in August 2004. The feasibility study by the Project\u2019s technical consultants, Fichtner \nGmbH, was completed in July 2005. Fauji Foundation filed its tariff petition with NEPRA in \nJanuary 2006 and, following public hearings in August 2006, NEPRA notified the determined \ntariff in October 2006. An engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the \nmain aspects of the project was signed in February 2007. The Project is expected to reach \nfinancial closure by fourth quarter of 2007, and is expected to reach its commercial operations \ndate by the fourth quarter of 2009. \n \n ", "  7\n2.  Configuration and Main Components \n21.  The plant will have one gas turbine of 121.5MW, one heat recovery steam generator, \nand one steam turbine of 62.8MW. A 15-km gas transmission pipeline will be built to supply gas \nto the Project complex, and power from the Project will be evacuated to NTDC\u2019s 220kV Daharki-\nRohri transmission line.8 Housing for staff will also be constructed on the Project\u2019s premises. \n \n3.  Sponsors and Ownership \n22.  Fauji Foundation will act as sponsor for the Project and will directly own between 51% \nand 75% (it may allocate residual stakes up to its 75% shareholding to its controlled subsidiaries) \nof the equity. It will also counterguarantee the financial obligations of the holding company that \nare  proposed  to  be  guaranteed  by  ADB  (see  below  under  ADB\u2019s  Equity  Investment  and \nGuarantee). \n \n23.  Fauji Foundation was established as a charitable trust in 1954, and operates on a self- \nsustaining basis, channeling about 80% of the profits from its commercial ventures into welfare \nprograms for ex-servicemen and their eligible dependents, about 7% of the country\u2019s population. \n \n24.  Fauji Foundation\u2019s portfolio includes ventures in fertilizer production, power generation, \npetroleum product distribution, cement production, grains and sugars, and services, among \nothers.  Its  earnings  from  operations  in  FY2006  were  PRs3.3  billion,  on  an  asset  base  of \nPRs44.3 billion.  \n \n25.  Fauji Foundation has prior experience of owning, managing and operating a low-BTU \ngas-fired combined cycle power plant in Pakistan. It is the largest owner (45.33%) of Fauji \nKabirwala, established in 1997 in collaboration with El Paso Energy International and ADB, \nwhich also provided a loan to the project (footnote 2). Another international power company, \nGlobeleq, bought El Paso\u2019s shares (as part of an acquisition of all of El Paso\u2019s non-domestic \npower assets) in 2006 and Globeleq has a shareholding of 42.17%. ADB retains a minority \nequity  interest  of  12.5%.  The  plant  is  well managed.  In  addition to  Fauji  Kabirwala,  Fauji \nFoundation has also been a sponsor in two other ADB-supported projects, Fauji Fertilizer \nCompany Limited and Fauji Oil Terminal Company Limited (footnote 2). \n \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policy Aspects  \n1.  Environmental Safeguards \n26.  Plants such as Daharki Power that operate only on natural gas and do not use such \nalternate fuels as residual furnace oil or diesel are among the most environmentally-friendly \nthermal power options available. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) has assessed the \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project  in  relation  to  both \nPakistani legislation and World Bank guidelines applicable to new thermal power plants. The \nrequired no-objection certificate from the Sindh Provincial Environmental Protection Agency, \ngranted on 10 February 2007, followed public hearings in Karachi and Daharki. The local \nadministration supported the Project and there was no adverse public reaction. \n                                                 \n8  This transmission line will be financed by the second tranche of ADB\u2019s multitranche financing facility for Power \nTransmission Enhancement approved in December 2006 (ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan for Power Transmission Enhancement. Manila). This was confirmed to the due diligence mission by \nNTDC. \n ", "8       \n \n27.  The Project will be constructed in an area of unproductive saline land. No sensitive \nhabitats with high ecological value were found during the field survey and no adverse impacts \nare expected as a result of project operations. As the site is close to a water canal, no ground \nwater will be mined (as is common practice for power plants), thus avoiding possible negative \nimpacts on subsurface aquifers. Similarly, the impact on surface water bodies is expected to be \nslight  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  requirement  that  wastewater  be  treated  appropriately, \nconsistent with local environmental standards, before discharge.  \n \n28.  The EIA concludes that the more significant impacts of the Project are expected to be on \nnoise  and  ambient  air  quality.  The  detailed  plant  design  will  contain  appropriate  technical \nmeasures  to  comply  with  relevant  noise  standards.  To  assess  ambient  air  quality,  an  air \npollutant dispersion calculation was carried out. The initial estimates showed that the expected \nimpacts on ground level concentrations for nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and particulate matter of \n10 micrometres or less in aerodynamic diameter will be minimal and no statutory limit values (as \nprescribed by the Sindh Provincial Environmental Protection Agency) will be exceeded. \n \n29.  An environment management plan has been prepared to ensure that the environmental \ndisturbances associated with the construction and operational phases of the Project will be \nhandled in a way that is consistent with ADB environmental guidelines. Fauji Kabirwala, based \non the same technology and managed under the same arrangements as the Project, has plant \nemissions and effluents that are well within the prescribed standards (all Pakistan\u2019s provincial \nenvironmental  protection  agencies  follow  national  environmental  quality  standards  that  are \nbased on World Bank guidelines for acceptable noise, pollution and effluent discharges). The \nEPC contract has strict penalties for non-compliance with prescribed environmental standards \nfor noise emissions and effluent discharges. The Project has been classified as category B.  \nThe summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 6. \n \n2.  Social Safeguards  \n30.  The Project is classified as B for involuntary resettlement, as four families have been \ndisplaced from land that has been sold to Fauji Foundation by the previous landowner through a \nnegotiated settlement. The families, comprising 17 individuals, had been living as agricultural \nlaborers  on  the  land  in  housing  provided  by  the  previous  landowner.  The  employment \nopportunities of the households will remain unaffected as they will continue to work the lands of \nthe landowner and others. Agreement has been reached with the elders of the adjacent village, \nMitho Lakhan, for the families to be relocated to that village. The affected families were provided \nwith sufficient cash assistance to allow them to relocate and construct proper replacement \nhousing. The due diligence report is in Appendix 7.  \n \n31.  The Project site does not affect any indigenous peoples. Consequently, the Project is \nclassified as category C under the ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \nIV.  ADB EQUITY INVESTMENT AND GUARANTEE \n \nA.  Justification \n1.  The Project is Consistent with ADB and Government Strategies \n32.  The proposed assistance is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and sector strategies, as well \nas with the Government\u2019s strategic intentions. ADB\u2019s most recent country strategy and program \nupdate reports that \u201cADB views itself as one of Pakistan\u2019s strategic development partners for \n ", "  9\ninfrastructure development,\u201d with power as one of the main areas of support. It also notes that \n\u201cthe emphasis on lending for economic infrastructure will be continued, which is consistent with \nthe high priority attached to it in the Government\u2019s medium-term development framework.\u201d9 The \nreport clearly mandates ADB to promote the role of the private sector as a driver of investment, \ngrowth, and employment. Among ADB\u2019s focus sectors for private sector operations, power and \nenergy infrastructure feature prominently. \n \n33.  As part of its public sector program, ADB has a strong energy sector focus in Pakistan. \nWork on the enabling environment, reform, and regulations have created the right conditions for \nfurther public sector investment, as well as more private sector participation. In the short term, \nADB is helping the Government conduct energy sector analyses; capacity building; and project \nidentification, development, and implementation. Over the medium term, ADB is supporting \nlarge infrastructure development projects in renewable energy and power transmission and \ndistribution. \n \n34.  The energy sector is a core operational sector under ADB\u2019s medium-term strategy II.10 \nCatalyzing  investments  through  increased  private  sector  participation  in  ADB\u2019s  developing \nmember countries is identified in the medium-term strategy II as one of the five strategic \npriorities. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy11 designates the following as two of the most important \noperational priorities: (i) reducing poverty by, among other things, creating energy infrastructure \nfor sustainable economic growth; and (ii) promoting private sector involvement by restructuring \nthe energy sector and creating an enabling environment for private investors, especially in \ngeneration. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages ADB interventions to increase private \nsector participation in the energy sector to take advantage of the higher operational efficiencies \nthat private operators can achieve and to meet the large capital requirements. \n \n35.  ADB is also fully engaged with the private power subsector in Pakistan, through loans \nand investments made since 1996. This includes the successful12 Fauji Kabirwala Project and \nmore recently, the $150 million loan to the KESC as well as the loan to New Bong Escape, \nPakistan\u2019s first hydropower IPP (footnote 8). ADB is currently considering several other power \nfinancing opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in projects with low environmental impact (such \nas run-of-the-river hydropower schemes, wind power, and biogas).  \n \n36.  Since Daharki Power will be the first gas-only IPP to reach financial closure under the \n2002 policy, ADB\u2019s support will send a strong signal to potential local and foreign investors and \nthus help provide impetus to the Government\u2019s plans to expand electricity generation capacity to \nmeet the growing energy deficit. ADB\u2019s equity participation will also enhance the governance \nprofile of the Project. \n \n2.  The Project has Important Demonstration Effects for Further Investment in \nthe Sector  \n37.  One of the main reasons why there have been no new international investment in IPPs \nin Pakistan in the last 7 years is the low return offered to shareholders under government  \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

Manila. The PCR rated the Project as successful because of its strong operational performance. The \noverall financial internal rate of return on the project was estimated at 17%, and for ADB\u2019s equity, if realized, almost \n23%). The project has been, and continues to be, in full compliance with all stipulated covenants. It has a strong \ndebt repayment track record and at present is risk-rated good (RR-2).  \n ", "10       \npolicies, including the 2002 policy. The enhanced returns are likely to make both this Project \nand other similar projects significantly more appealing to investors. By providing the guarantee, \nADB is helping to set a precedent for future power sector financings in Pakistan, highlighting the \nneed for an adequate risk-reward structure. This may lead either to (i) replications of leveraged \nholding company structures, and/or (ii) a realization among policy makers the balance between \nrisks and rewards needs to be adequately addressed.   \n \n38.  At the same time, this structure, which is routinely used in international utility financing, \nbut represents a significant market innovation in Pakistan, will enable the Project to go ahead \n(and therefore to address the looming power deficit) in spite of customary time lags in policy \nformulation  and  implementation,  and  without  additional  cost  to  the  Government  or  the \nconsumers. Upon learning of the guarantee structure, Fauji Foundation\u2019s original joint venture \npartner, Globeleq, indicated renewed interest (although shortly thereafter this was overtaken by \nits decision to make an overall exit from Asia, which precluded any further investment).  \n \nB.  Corporate Governance, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n39.  Both the holding company and the project company will have the same governance \nstructure, and ADB will have the right to representation on the respective boards of directors in \nproportion to its shareholding. In addition, for minority protection and ADB policy compliance, \nADB will have veto rights over a number of major decisions affecting the companies. Fauji \nFoundation and ADB have agreed to explore the possibility of appointing independent directors \nto the boards, in anticipation of a potential future public listing. The boards will meet bi-monthly \nduring  the  project  implementation  phase  and  quarterly  thereafter.  Through  its  board \nmemberships, ADB will be able to monitor closely FPCDL\u2019s progress vis-\u00e0-vis agreed-upon \nmilestones and the financial model. The holding company will be required to follow international \nfinancial  reporting  standards,  and  the  project  company  will  adhere  to  generally  accepted \naccounting  standards  in  Pakistan.  Both  companies  will  be  audited  by  accounting  firms \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nC.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n40.  Both  as  a  shareholder  and  as  a  guarantee  provider,  ADB  will  require  the  holding \ncompany to provide comprehensive reports that detail: (i) progress in the implementation of the \nProject, (ii) the operating cost structure and operating performance, and (iii) the achievement of \nestimated returns. Appendix 1 provides the performance indicators. \n \nD.  Project Review \n41.  The Project will be reviewed regularly as per standard ADB portfolio management and \nProject evaluation practice, including a project completion report (following the completion of the \nProject envisaged in April 2009) and annual reviews. \n \nE.  Documentation \n42.  Standard documentation for a transaction of this kind will be prepared, including a \nsubscription agreement, a shareholders\u2019 agreement, a put option agreement, a guarantee, a \ncounterguarantee and such other agreements as may be necessary. \n \n ", "  11\nF.  Compliance with ADB Investment Limitations \n43.  This investment will represent 1.26% of the total ADB nonsovereign portfolio and will \nincrease  ADB\u2019s  exposure  to  the  \u201cConventional  Energy  Generation\u201d  sector  from  12.58%  to \n13.67%. It will increase ADB\u2019s non-sovereign portfolio exposure to Pakistan from 8.14% to \n9.28%.  \n \n44.  The  proposed  equity  investment  and  the  proposed  ADB  guarantee  each  constitute \nexposure to the holding company. Since the amount of the investment and the guarantee \ncombined exceeds 25% of the total value of the assets of the holding company, the exposure \nlimits  set  by  applicable  ADB  policy13 for  a  single  financing  recipient  would  be  exceeded. \nHowever, since the guarantee undertakings of ADB (which constitute approximately 95% of the \nnet exposure of ADB to the transaction) are in turn counterguaranteed by Fauji Foundation, and \nthe  obligations  of  Fauji  Foundation  under  its  counterguarantee  are  secured,  Management \nconsiders  that  this  strongly  mitigates  the  risks  inherent  in  such  exposure.  The  proposed \nassistance complies with all other ADB prudential exposure limits. \n \nG.  Anticorruption  Measures:  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  \n45.  Fauji Foundation was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require the holding company and the project company to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism. Further, the \nholding company and the lenders of the guaranteed loan to the holding company will covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. Such obligations will be contained in the \nADB investment and guarantee documentation. The investment and guarantee documentation \nbetween ADB, Fauji Foundation, and the holding company will further allow ADB to investigate \nany violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nV.  ASSURANCE \n \n46.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to ADB\u2019s proposed assistance. \nNo funding will be disbursed and the guarantee will not be effective until ADB receives such \nconfirmation. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed financing would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  an equity investment of up to (a) $2,750,000 or (b) 25% of the issued share \ncapital in the holding company of Foundation Power Company Daharki Limited, \nwhichever is lower; \n \n(ii)  a guarantee in a principal amount of up to $44,000,000 plus interest, in favor of \nthe lenders to the holding company;   \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2007.

Sector Framework and Reform \n \n1.  The power sector in Pakistan, which encompasses the generation, transmission, and \ndistribution of electricity, is regulated by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority Act, \n1997. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), which was constituted as an \nindependent entity, is exclusively empowered under the act and related rules to regulate all \nfacets of the power sector, including the electricity tariffs charged by the Karachi Electric Supply \nCorporation  (KESC).  NEPRA  is  thus  empowered  to  (i)  grant  licenses  for  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution;  (ii)  approve  tariffs,  rates,  and  charges  across  the  sector;  \n(iii) establish uniform industry performance via codes and standards; and (iv) enforce the above. \nNEPRA, although mandated as an independent entity, is governed by a chairman and four \nmembers,  all  of  whom  are  appointed  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan  with  the  members \nrecommended by, and representing, provincial interests. \n \n2.  Power  sector  policies  and  related  legislative  frameworks  are  developed  and \nimplemented by the Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated \nthe process of power sector reforms and restructuring in the early 1990s on the advice of the \nWorld Bank. The reforms, developed in various stages and through different initiatives, are \nreflected in several policies, including the 1994 power policy, the 1995 hydropower policy, the \n1995 transmission line policy, the 1998 power policy, and the 2002 power policy (the policy \nunder which the Daharki Power Project is being developed). These were designed, to a large \nextent, to attract private sector participation in the restructured power sector. The Government is \nalso unbundling the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) into various \nindependent entities. The broad objectives of these policies have been to: (i) bring efficiencies \nacross  the  entire  sector  via  competitive  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  with \nappropriate  independent  regulatory  oversight;  (ii)  rationalize  prices  and  subsidies;  and  \n(iii) encourage private capital formation and investment to meet growing electricity demand.  \nThe privatization of KESC was a key element in this ongoing program. \n \n3.  The power sector continues to be in transition and is today semi-privatized and fairly well \nregulated. The sector has historically been characterized by very significant Government control \nthrough the WAPDA and KESC monopolies (which function as vertically integrated utilities \nencompassing generation, transmission, and distribution) and by significant inefficiency, with \nlosses in excess of 25%, and an inability to meet demand. This has changed over the last \ndecade, at least in terms of outright government control, and Pakistan today enjoys significant \nprivate-sector-led generation through 21 independent power producers (IPPs), 19 of which were \nsanctioned under the 1994 power policy,1 and which together represent more than 30% of total \ngeneration capacity. With ADB\u2019s active assistance2, KESC was privatized in late 2005 and to \ndate remains the only vertically integrated private sector entity in charge of the majority of its \ngeneration and all of its transmission and distribution.  As of December 2006, some 40% of \nPakistan\u2019s installed generation capacity was owned by the private sector (through the IPPs and \nKESC). This percentage is likely to increase, with planned privatizations of Jamshoro Power \nCompany and a secondary public offering of Kot Addu Power Company. The evident success in \nattracting private sector investment into power generation was not without difficulties, and most \nIPPs, especially those under the 1994 power policy, ended up in contract disputes with the \n                                                 \n1  Hub Power Company, a 1,292MW power plant, was actually under development prior to the 1994 power policy and \nwas commissioned in 1997. \n2  ADB. 2000.

These disputes were largely driven \nby significant overcapacity in the mid- to late 1990s (the exact opposite situation to today) and \nconsequent  tariff  implications.  Notwithstanding  this  discord,  these  disputes  were  ultimately \nsettled  amicably,  with  minimal  adjustments  to  the  contracts.  The  terms  of  the  contracts, \nalthough renegotiated, were ultimately honored, which provides a degree of comfort in the \npresent investment environment. \n \n4.  Significant  power  sector  reforms  supported  by  multilateral  development  banks  are \nunderway with the aim of unbundling WAPDA\u2019s power wing into many discrete generation and \ndistribution units, and by placing WAPDA\u2019s transmission assets into a single corporatized entity, \nthe National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). NTDC was incorporated in \n1998 and is responsible for power transmission in all of Pakistan, apart from the areas served \nby KESC. NTDC, which operates transmission lines of 66, 132, 220 and 500 kVs now  assumes \nthe  additional  function  of  acting  as  the  single  buyer  of  wholesale  generation  from  many \ncompanies including IPPs (but excluding KESC) for onward transmission and sale to eight \ndistribution entities. These companies include the Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Islamabad, \nMultan, Peshwar, Hyderabad and Quetta Electric Supply Companies, most commonly known as \nDISCOs. It is likely that the power from Daharki Power will be evacuated by NTDC to the \nHyderabad DISCO. At present a \u201csingly buyer\u2013single seller\u201d model is being put in place, which \nthe Government hopes, as more investment flows into the power sector, will evolve into a \n\u201cmultiple buyer\u2013multiple seller\u201d regime where generators and distributors can contract directly. \n \nB.  Tariff Structure \n \n5.  The  retail  tariff  regime  in  Pakistan  is  based  on  different  classes  of  consumers,  \n(e.g.,  residential,  industrial,  and  commercial)  and  graduated.3 It  includes  significant  cross \nsubsidies.  NEPRA  is  responsible  for  determining  tariffs  under  its  Tariff  Standards  and \nProcedures Rules, 1998 which specify standards by which tariffs are set, and procedures by \nwhich they are adjudicated. These standards are sufficiently broad to allow discretion and thus \nenable  the  development  of  various  tariff  regimes.  Tariff  determinations  are  based  on  the \nprinciple  of  recovering  prudently  incurred  costs  and  returns  on  the  applicant\u2019s  rate  base, \napplicable  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  They  contain  automatic  quarterly  increases  to  reflect \nchanges in fuel costs or purchased power costs, in addition to macroeconomic indexation of \ncosts. NEPRA\u2019s tariffs become effective once they are officially notified by the Government in its \nofficial gazette.  \n \n6.  Average end-user tariffs for eight ex-WAPDA DISCOs and KESC are depicted in Table \nA2.1. \n \nTable A2.1: Average Electricity Tariffs, 2001\u20132006 \n(Paisa/ kWh) \n         \nYear  2001 2002  2003  2004  2005 2006 CAGR (%) \n     \n \n               \nDISCOs  299  373  395  384  N/A  N/A  6.6 \nKESC  406  454  472  500  543  587  7.6 \n               \nCAGR = compound average growth rate, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, DISCOs = ex-WAPDA \ndistribution companies.     \nSource: KESC and NEPRA Annual Report 2005.  \n                                                 \n3  Tariffs are charged on a tier basis.

In order to grant greater financial independence to the newly formed generators and \nDISCOs (spun out of WAPDA), and to reduce tariff subsidies to WAPDA in fiscal year (FY) 2006, \nthe subsidy requested by WAPDA was $1.316 billion. The Government recently announced an \nunanticipated 10% electricity tariff increase. At present the end tariff charged by DISCOs is \nheavily  subsidized,  based  on  WAPDA\u2019s  overall  generation  cost.  This,  coupled  with  high \ntransmission  and  distribution  losses  (primarily  because  of  underinvestment  in  the  network, \nresulted in an increasing financial burden for WAPDA as well as for the DISCOs). The gravity of \nthe situation can be seen in the number of days payable to IPPs (which sell power to WAPDA \nthrough  NTDC,  which  has  of  late  been  two  months.  The  recent  tariff  increase  has  been \nwelcomed by IPPs and by industry participants including commercial financiers which see this \nas  a  first  step  by  the  Government  to  make  WAPDA  solvent  in  advance  of  its  eventual \nprivatization, which has been on hold since 2000.  \n \nC.  Electricity Demand \n \n8.  Pakistan\u2019s electricity consumption grew at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of \n6.8% from 2001 to 2006, and amounted to 67,603 gigawatt-hours (GWh) at the end of 2006. \nThis growth is being driven across all classes of consumers (except bulk supply/other) but \nespecially by commercial, agricultural, industrial and domestic or residential consumers, which \nregistered CAGRs of 11.3%, 10.1%, 6.7% and 6.2% respectively, in the same time period. \nConsumption has continued to grow on the back of recent annual economic growth rates of over \n7%, and similar growth rates in electricity demand are expected to continue in the near future \nbased on projections for continued strong economic growth and higher rates of per capita \nelectricity consumption. \n \n9.

Electricity Supply and Demand Projection \n \n12.  The PPIB is an important institution in the power sector in Pakistan. Set up in 1994, \nPPIB acts as a \u201cone-window\u201d operation to facilitate private investment in IPPs under the national \npower and hydropower policies. Given the enormous power requirements and Government\u2019s \npolicy for encouraging private sector participation in power generation, PPIB is expected to play \nan important part in mobilizing investments into new thermal and hydropower generation, as it \ndid in the mid and late 1990s.4   \n \n13.  Against 19,450 MW of installed capacity in Pakistan, the firm supply at the end of 2006 \nwas 15,072 MW. By comparison, peak demand for 2006 was 15,483 MW, which resulted in a \ndeficit of about 411 MW. Assuming no additional capacity is added, PPIB forecasts the following \nrelationship between peak demand and firm supply for the next 7 years (Table A2.4). \n \nTable A2.4: Firm Supply Versus Peak Demand Projections, 2007\u20132013 \n(MW) \n \nYear  Firm Supplya Peak Demand Surplus / (Deficit) \n       \n2007  15,091  16,548  (1,457) \n2008  15,055  17,689  (2,634) \n2009  15,055  19,080  (4,028) \n2010  15,055  20,584  (5,529) \n2011  15,055  22,205  (7,150) \n2012  15,055  23,953  (8,899) \n2013  15,055  25,840  (10,785) \n       \nMW = megawatt. \na Includes KESC\u2019s generation capacity. \nSource: Private Power Infrastructure Board. \n \n                                                 \n4  PPIB has facilitated investments in over 15 IPPs with a combined installed capacity of 5,577 MW under the 1994 \nand 1998 power policies \n ", "  Appendix 2  19 \n      \n14.  This growing power deficit will particularly affect large urban centers such as Karachi, \nLahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, and Rawalpindi. These cities are home to most of Pakistan\u2019s \nindustrial assets, including most small and medium-sized enterprises, and contribute over 35% \nof  the  country\u2019s  GDP.    Recognizing  the  gravity  of  the  situation,  the  Government,  through \nWAPDA\u2019s  Power  and  Energy  Planning  wings  and  PPIB,  has  developed  several  long-term \nelectricity demand load projections and new supply options. Daharki Power features prominently \nin these projections because of its low-cost generation and base load status. In order to meet \ngrowing demands and to use Pakistan\u2019s significant water resources, especially in the northern \npart of the country, WAPDA has developed a least-cost generation expansion plan, which \nemphasizes indigenous sources of energy, primarily hydropower (and in some cases coal), in \nline with the Government\u2019s power sector policies. However, uncertainty remains about the pace \nof  this  overall  generation  expansion,  given  the  numerous  delays  experienced  to  date.  \nInvestment in hydropower IPPs is expected to gain momentum now that the arrangements for \nNew  Bong  Escape  Hydro  Power  Plant  (part-financed  by  ADB) 5  have  been  finalized. \nNevertheless,  concerns  about  the  speed  of  capacity  addition  remain.  Table  A2.5  shows \nPakistan\u2019s power demand projections relative to planned capacity additions by WAPDA, IPPs \nand KESC. This is estimated to represent the best case scenario from a capacity addition point \nof view, as it assumes that all capacity additions will occur as planned, in the next 5 years. \n \nTable A2.5: Peak Demand, Firm Supply, and Projected Capacity Additions, 2007\u20132011 \n(MW) \n \nItem  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \n           \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Daharki Power Project (the Project) consists of a 171 MW combined cycle \nlow-BTU gas-fired power plant in Daharki, District Ghotki, Sindh Province, in Pakistan, and is \nexpected to be a base load plant with 100% dispatch because of its low cost. The Project will \nuse a dedicated gas supply from Mari gas fields. It will be the first natural-gas-only plant \ndeveloped under the Government\u2019s 2002 power policy and will be undertaken according to a 25-\nyear build-own-operate (BOO) structure. A feasibility study by Fichtner GmbH was completed in \nJuly 2005. The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) provided no objection clearance \nfor the Project on 10 February 2007, based on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nprepared in 2005.1  \n \n2.  This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) has been prepared for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in line with its environmental and social safeguard policies, and the \ninformation disclosure requirements for an environmental category B project.  The SIEE is \nbased on the EIA and supplementary information.  \n \n3.  Only four families, comprising 17 individuals, living as agricultural laborers on the land \nacquired by Fauji Foundation2 on a willing buyer\u2013willing seller basis, will be affected by the \ntransaction. Agreement has been reached with the adjoining village that the displaced families \nwill  be  allowed  to  relocate  to  the  village.  The  families  will  continue  their  occupation  as \nagricultural laborers on new lands acquired by the landowner in the immediate vicinity. There \nare no indigenous peoples living in the surrounding area.  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s  review  of  the  Project  covered  environmental,  health  and  safety  and  social \ninformation submitted by Fauji Foundation, the National Transmission Distribution Corporation \n(NTDC), site visits by an ADB mission to the project site in March 2007, and discussions with \nFauji Foundation, Mari Gas Company Limited (MGCL), and NTDC officials.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n1.  Technical Features \n \n5.  Fauji  Foundation  is  the  sponsor  for  the  Project  and  has  prior  experience  owning, \nmanaging and operating a low-BTU gas-fired combined cycle power plant in Pakistan.  It is the \nlargest shareholder in Fauji Kabirwala Power Plant,3 established in 1997 with El Paso Energy \nInternational and ADB (which provided a loan to the project). In addition to Fauji Kabirwala, \nFauji Foundation has also received funding from ADB for two other projects, Fauji Fertilizer \nCompany Limited4 and Fauji Oil Terminal and Distribution Company Limited.5  \n \n                                                 \n1 Fichtner GmbH.

A 15-km gas transmission pipeline will be \nbuilt to supply gas to the project complex, and power from the Project will be evacuated to \nNTDC\u2019s 220 Kv Daharki\u2013Rohri transmission line. Housing for staff will be constructed on the \nProject\u2019s premises.  \n \n7.  The Project will be implemented under an engineering, procurement and construction \n(EPC)  contract,  combining  detailed  design,  construction  and  supply  and  installation  of \nequipment and commissioning.  The EPC contract was awarded to Doosan Heavy Industries & \nConstruction Co Ltd. in February 2007. Construction is expected to be completed within 24 \nmonths of Doosan receiving notice to proceed. Doosan will also provide a 24-month warranty \ncovering power plant, equipment and works from full commissioning of the Project.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Project Area \n \n8.  The project area of 132.44 acres has been acquired from a single landowner. The study \narea for the EIA covered the land and an area of 1-2 km2 around the project site. The project \nsite is along Dad Lagari road, about 8.5 km south of the city of Daharki.  \n \nD.  Physical Environment \n \n1.  Physiography and Soil \n \n9.  The topography of the area is generally flat. The soil is generally alluvial in nature and is \ncomposed of alternating layers of silty clay and clay. \n \n2.  Climate \n \n10.  The climate of the project area is arid subtropical, characterized by hot summers and \nmild winters. The closest meteorological observatory is at Rohri, Sukkur District, about 110 km \nfrom the site. May, June, and July are the hottest months. August and September are hot, with \nhigh humidity. The winter months are December, January and February.  The mean maximum \ntemperature during summer is 44oC and the mean minimum is 29oC. During winter the mean \nmaximum temperature is about 23 oC and the mean minimum is 9oC.    \n \n11.  The average annual rainfall of the area is 122 mm, with mean annual relative humidity of \n52% and a wind speed of 80 km/hr with a north-east prevailing wind direction. Frost is common, \nand occurs during December and January. Meteorological data are presented in Table A8.1. \n \n3.  Air Quality \n \n12.  The EIA includes the results of the ambient air quality monitoring measurements were \ncarried out at 10 locations from 29-31 May 2007. Results show that SO , NO and CO values \n2 2 \nare within limits as prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO). However, PM  values are \n10\nhigh (173 to 190 ug/m3) because of the proximity to desert areas. The results of the ambient air \nquality  are  shown  in  Table  A8.2.  The  air  emission  standards  of  the  World  Bank  and  the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency of Pakistan are presented in Table A8.3.   \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                       Appendix 6      29\n4.  Noise Level \n \n13.  The project area can be classified as noise-free because of the virtual absence of \nvehicular traffic, and industrial and commercial activities. One-time noise level measurement \nwas carried out at 10 locations from 29 to 31 May 2007. Noise levels in the project area range \nfrom 37.2 dB(A) to 47.8 dB(A) , as presented in Table A8.4.  \n \n5.  Water Quality \n \n14.  The quality of water from hand pumps and tubewells, as well as from the Lower Dahar \nWah Canal, was evaluated.  Groundwater quality was found to be unfit for drinking purposes \nbecause  of  the  presence  of  an  excessive  amount  of  total  dissolved  solids  (TDS),  total \nsuspended solids (TSS), calcium and magnesium hardness as calcium carbonate (CaCO ), and \n3\nammonia. In case of surface water, the amounts of BOD  was 52.8 and chemical oxygen \n5\ndemand was 74 mg/l, both of which are on the high side. The results of the water quality \nanalysis (surface and groundwater) are presented in Tables A8.5 and A8.6. International and \nnational standards for effluent from the thermal power plants are presented in Tables A8.7 and \nA8.8. \n \nE.  Biological Environment \n \n15.  In Ghotki District, there are three inland forests, Mirpur Plantation, Sarhad Plantation and \nAdilpur Plantation, which are located 15 to 20 km from the project site. The main plant species \nof  the  plantations  are  shisham  (Dalbergia  sisso),  babul/kikar  (Acacia  nilotica)  and  bahan \n(Populus euphractica). There is one riverine forest, Rounti Forest, about 20 km from the project \nsite.  The  main  plant  species  of  the  forest  are  babul  (Acacia  nilotica),  bahan  (Populus \neuphractica), lai (Tamarix gallica) and jhoa (Tamarix dioca).  Other tree species of the area \ninclude kandi (Prosopis specigera), karir (caparis aphylla), ber (Zizyphus jujuba), pipal (Ficus \nreligosa), neem (Azadarachts indica), pilu (Salvadora eleoides), and khabar (Salvadora percica). \nA number of varieties of shrubs and grasses are also very common in the area. The most \ncommon shrub is ak (Calotropis procera) and the most common grass is kan (Saccharum \nspontancum). \n \n16.  The mammal biodiversity of Ghotki District is limited to jackal and wild boar populations. \nOther species rarely seen in the area include various kinds of deer, particularly chinkara and \nfoxes.  Bird species include hawk, kit, crow, parrot, common sparrow, pigeon, tillur, quail, \npartridge, and water fowl along the river. \n \n17.  There are several local trees, wild animals and bird species in the area, but none is \nendangered. No wildlife sanctuary or game reserve is located in the vicinity of the study area.  \n \nF.  Socioeconomic Environment \n \n18.  The surrounding areas are inhabited by agricultural communities. The population of the \nstudy area lives in scattered settlements of Bashirabad and two villages (goths), Mitho Lakhan \nand Sultan/Bachal Lashari. Based on the socioeconomic survey, the estimated population of the \nstudy area is 1,400.  \n \n19.  The Project is classified as B for involuntary resettlement as four families have been \ndisplaced from the land (132 acres) that has been sold to Fauji Foundation by the previous \nlandowner through a negotiated settlement. The families, comprising 17 individuals, had been \n ", "30       Appendix 6 \nliving as agricultural laborers on the land in housing provided by the previous landowner. The \nemployment opportunities of the households will remain unaffected as they will continue to work \nthe lands of the landowner and others. Agreement has been reached with the elders of the \nadjacent village, Mitho Lakhan, that families may be relocated to that village. The affected \nfamilies were provided with cash assistance to allow them to relocate them and construct proper \nreplacement housing.  \n \n20.  No archaeological, historical and religious sites exist in the project area. However, there \nare some scattered mosques, graveyards and shrines. No indigenous group of people was \nidentified. \n \nG.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Impacts During Construction \n \n21.  Based on supplementary information, 3.8 million cubic feet soil will be required to fill the \nproject site level up to its required elevation (0.2 m above the graded ground elevation). A large \nquantity of available excavated soil from the erection of plant machinery and other allied works \nwill be reused as filling materials. Additional borrow materials will be drawn from the adjoining \npoor quality saline areas.   \n \n22.  Sewage will be generated from construction camps, the contractor\u2019s workshop, and the \nequipment washing yard. Sewer drains will lead to an on-site disposal area for treatment or \nholding in septic tanks with leach fields. The septic tanks and soak pits will be located at a \nminimum distance of 300m from water sources, and not in an area with a high groundwater \ntable. All waste from plant drains subject to oil spills will be collected into an oily water separator \nbefore being drained into the disposal system. The oil waste will be separated and collected in \ndrums and shipped to disposal areas from where they will be hauled away by local contractors.    \n  \n23.  Dust generated during construction is expected to have some adverse impact on air \nquality. This problem will be mitigated by wetting the paths of heavy vehicles with water, and \ncontrolling the speed and limiting the movement of vehicles. All vehicles and machines will have \nroutine  maintenance  to  reduce  engine  emissions.  Vehicles  used  to  transport  construction \nmaterial will be covered with tarpaulin. Impacts on local communities will be limited as the \nimmediate area is sparsely populated.  \n \n24.  Noise will be generated during construction. Construction activities will be planned so \nthat  simultaneous  noisy  operations  are  avoided.  Powered  mechanical  equipment  such  as \nbulldozers, air compressors, concrete pumps, excavators, and concrete mixers will only be used \nwith low sound power whenever possible. Silencers or mufflers on construction equipment will \nbe used. Protective devices will be provided to workers to minimize the effects of high noise \nlevels, which will be within with the parameters set out in the World Bank\u2019s Pollution Prevention \nand Abatement Handbook (1998). \n \n25.  Construction of the plant will require clearing and removal of common vegetation, mainly \nweeds, bushes and the few trees existing on the project site. Planting of indigenous trees and \nbushes belonging to the natural types at the site will be undertaken.  \n \n26.  The general mobility and accessibility of the local residents and their livestock in and \naround the project area is unlikely to be significantly hindered during construction. A temporary \n ", "                                                                                                                                                       Appendix 6      31\nfence will be installed around the project area to ensure that project activities remain confined \nwithin project boundaries. \n \n2.  Impacts During Operations \n \n27.  All process water and sanitary waste water of the project will be adequately treated \nbefore it is discharged to the surface water. Wastewater after treatment will be stored in an \nevaporation pond, which will be properly lined to ensure that there is no seepage and to \nsafeguard  the  quality  of  groundwater.  Relevant  standards  for  final  disposal  of  process \nwastewater  effluent  streams,  including  boiler  blowdown,  cooling  tower  blowdown,  and \ndemineralizer waste, will be strictly observed and monitored. \n  \n28.  Water leading from oil storage tanks and transformers will first be collected at an oil \nwater connection pit, treated at oily water separator, and then disposed into the evaporation \npond. Similarly, storm and rain water will also be collected at the evaporation pond. \n \n29.  The air pollutant dispersion calculations indicate that, because of plant operations, the \nmaximum allowable ground level concentrations for NO should be 17.2 ug/m3 , for SO  0.2 \nx    x\nug/m3, and for PM  6.9 ug/m3. As the project area is currently devoid of industrial pollution, no \n10\nsignificant impacts are envisaged on ambient air quality during operations. Air quality monitoring  \nsystems,  as  well  as  noise  level  monitoring,  will  be  set  up  to  meet  the  Pakistan  National \nEnvironmental Quality Standards (NEQS) as prescribed under by the National Environmental \nProtection Act (1997). \n \n30.  The plant equipment will need to comply with the project specification standards to meet \nambient noise limits. As the noise limits and stack emission standards will not be exceeded, the \nimpact on fauna and flora and adjacent communities will be low. Operation of the facility will \nresult in air and noise emissions that could have an impact on the resting, nesting, and roosting \nactivities of the surrounding flora and fauna. Extensive planting of trees will be carried out inside \nthe power plant area, along the roads and paths along the entire boundary wall of the project \narea, and in available spaces in the project area, which will mitigate any impacts on flora, and \nwill also improve the aesthetic appearance of the area. \n \n31.  The construction of the plant will provide job opportunities for skilled and unskilled \nemployment to the locals, and lead to improvements in the socioeconomic conditions of the \npeople. Some commercial activities, such as small eateries, a gas station, general stores, \nworkshops, and small warehouses are likely to develop at the site during construction. These \nactivities will benefit the local population. \n \nH.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n \n1.  Organizational Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities \n \n32.  Fauji Foundation will nominate a project manager who will be responsible for overall \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  Project.  The  manager  will  also  supervise  and  monitor \ncompliance with the contractor\u2019s obligations related to design and construction, as well as with \nenvironmental and social requirements. An independent monitoring consultant will act as the \nexternal monitoring agency on behalf of Fauji Foundation and will monitor all activities at regular \nintervals. The consultant will report to the manager on compliance issues. \n \n ", "32       Appendix 6 \n33.  Fauji Foundation will also establish a health, safety, and environmental management \nunit  (HSEM  unit)  to  implement  the  HSEM  policy.  To  support  the  unit,  three  staff  (a  shift \nchemist/engineer, a plant operator, and a laboratory/plant chemist) will be employed. The unit \nwill  monitor  the  environmental  performance  of  the  contractor  as  required  by  SEPA.  \nEnvironmental training will be carried out for the contactor and construction supervision staff. \n \n34.  During  project  construction,  the  HSEM  unit  will  monitor  compliance  with  SEPA \nrequirements regarding air emissions, water quality (drinking and surface water quality), noise \nstandards and waste disposal. The effects on the socioeconomic environment will also be \nmonitored by the HSEM unit, considering parameters such as local employment, health and \nsafety of communities and mobility of local women. Table A8.9 presents the environmental \nmonitoring program for the construction and operation phases of the Project. The environment \nmanagement plan is presented in Table A8.10.  \n \n35.  The environmental monitoring to be carried out by Independent Monitoring Consultant at \nthe construction stage is estimated at about PRs.2.0 million.  The cost for internal monitoring \nand training to be carried out by Fauji Foundation staff is estimated at PRs. 3.5 million for \nconstruction as well as for 2 years\u2019 monitoring during the operation stage (PRs. 3.2 million for \nmonitoring and PRs. 0.3 million for training).  \n \nI.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n36.  The Project has been well known to local communities for some time, particularly given \nthe proximity of the Mari gas field complex. Consultations were held with local leaders and with \nmembers of the community. The required no-objection certificate from the SEPA was granted \non 10 February 2007 and was followed by public hearings in Karachi and Daharki. The local \nadministration supports the project and there has been no adverse public reaction. \n \nJ.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n37.  The  Project  will  have  no  significant  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and \noperations because of the nature of the Project and its site. The Project will install a low NO  \nx\nburner to reduce NO  emissions so they are within the permissible levels of the NEQS. \nx\n \nK.  Conclusion \n \n38.  The major conclusions on the Project\u2019s environmental impacts are as follows.  First, it \nwill  have  no  significant  environmental  impacts.  The  NO   emissions  by  the  gas  turbine \nx\ngenerators can be controlled effectively, and air quality can be maintained within the prescribed \nstandards.  Second,  it  will  draw  on  Fauji  Foundation\u2019s  well-recognized  health,  safety  and \nenvironmental procedures to deal effectively with any accidents or disasters during project \nconstruction  and  operation.  Third,  the  Project  can  deal  effectively  with  any  potential \nenvironmental impacts, which are well understood and can be mitigated.   \n ", "

The Project \n1.  The Project consists of a 171MW combined cycle low BTU gas-fired power plant in \nDaharki, District Ghotki, Sindh province, in Pakistan, and is expected to be a base load plant \nwith 100% dispatch (due to its low cost tariff). The feasibility study by the Project\u2019s technical \nconsultants, Fichtner GmbH was completed in July 2005. An engineering, procurement and \nconstruction contract for the main aspects of the project was signed in February 2007. The \nproject is expected to reach financial close by August 2007, and is expected to commence \ncommercial operations by September 2009.  \n2.  Fauji  Foundation,  the  Sponsor,  was  established  as  a  charitable  trust  in  1954,  and \noperates on a completely self sustaining basis, channeling approximately 80% of the profits \nfrom commercial ventures into welfare programs that serve a beneficiary population consisting \nof  ex-servicemen  and  their  eligible  dependents.  Fauji  Foundation  has  prior  experience  of \nowning, managing and operating a low-BTU gas-fired power plant in Pakistan. It is the largest \nowner of Fauji Kabirwala, established in 1997 with El Paso Energy International and ADB, which \nprovided a loan to the project. In addition to Fauji Kabirwala, Fauji Foundation has also been a \npartner/borrower in other ADB projects, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited and Fauji Oil Terminal \nCompany Limited. \n \n3.  The Daharki plant will have one gas turbine of 121.5MW, one heat recovery steam \ngenerator, and one steam turbine of 62.8MW. A 15 km gas transmission pipeline will supply gas \nto  the  Project  complex,  and  power  from  the  Project  will  be  evacuated  to  NTDC\u2019s  220Kv \nDaharki\u2013Rohri  transmission  line.  A  residential  colony  for  staff  will  be  constructed  on  the \nProject\u2019s premises.  \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Information and Consultations \n4.  Ghotki district in Sindh Province ranks among the lowest on social indicators, with the \nliteracy rate at only 29%. The literacy rate is heavily skewed between genders, with 44.2% and \n11.85% of male and female population being literate, respectively. While predominantly Moslem, \nas expected, there are a few Hindu families (Minghora). The population comprises Solongi, \nMaricha, Bhatti, Shaikh and Soomro households. Being a northern district of Sindh, Ghotki has \naccess to water resources. The sub-canal Mahi Wah, a distributary of the Guddu Barrage, \nirrigates the area, but land is affected by waterlogging, hence there are high levels of salinity \nacross lands that vary considerably in productive potential.  There are natural resources, such \nas oil and gas, and extractive industries. Crops include maize, sugarcane, cotton, rice, and \nthere are several mango orchards. Not many local people have many employment opportunities \nin the industries. The crime rate is very high and people, especially the poor, live under the \nstress of a poor law and order situation (with proximity to the Indus, there are many dacoits1 in \nthe area).  \n5.  The Project is located along Dad Lagari road, about 8.5 km south of the city of Daharki. \nDistrict Ghotki, Sindh Province. The project area is adjacent to Village (Goth) Mitho Lakhan, and \ncomprises 132 acres of saline, low productivity lands acquired from a single landowner.  \n                                                 \n1 Traditional bandit families.  \n ", "48      \n6.  The Project is classified as Category B under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) as four families will be displaced from the southeast corner of land (132 acres) that has \nbeen sold to Fauji Foundation by the previous landowner through a negotiated settlement. The \nfamilies, comprising 17 individuals, have been living as agricultural laborers on the land in \nhousing (two houses, with rudimentary mud-brick walls and GI sheet-roofs) provided by the \nlandowner.  \n7.  The principal members of the four families who were consulted during the preparation of \nthe  EIA,  and  most  recently  in  May  2007,  include  Weryam,  Haji  Gohram,  Riaz  Ahmad, \nMuhammad Hassan, Muhammad Anwar, Lal Buksh, Lutuf Ali, Abdul Wahid, and Abdul Latif. \nDuring those consultations, they acknowledged that the project was beneficial to the community, \nbut asked that their labor opportunities be protected, and compensation be paid as they had \nvery few assets \u2013 particularly as their housing had been provided by the landowner.  \n8.  The Project site does not affect any indigenous peoples. Consequently, the Project is \nclassified as Category C under the Indigenous Peoples policies. \n \nC.  Policy Framework, Entitlements, and Income Restoration \n9.  The legislation relating to land acquisition and compensation is the Land Acquisition Act \n(LAA) of 1894 (as amended). Following a national consultative process, a national resettlement \npolicy  and  related  ordnance  had  been  drafted,  both  of  which  are  being  reviewed  by  the \nprovincial  governments.  Currently,  the  Pakistan  Environment  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  is \nresponsible  of  both  environment  and  resettlement-related  matters.  The  responsibilities  for \nimplementation of resettlement-related matters are delegated to the provincial EPAs; however, \nformal land acquisition is carried out by the provincial Boards of Revenue and the District Land \nAcquisition Collectors. The categories of loss covered by the current regulations include land, \nphysical properties, crops, trees, as well as income, and access to livelihood opportunities. \nVulnerable groups are given special consideration, including women, children, destitute persons, \ntribal communities, squatters, persons with usufruct rights, and landless. Emphasis is also \nplaced on consultation with affected persons. \n10.  Although the laborers will continue to work the new lands of the previous landowner \u2013 \nand there are many similar opportunities for labor on other lands in the immediate area \u2013 \nagreement has been reached with the elders of the nearby village, Mitho Lakhan, that the \ndisplaced families can be relocated to that village with residence rights. Although the LAA does \nnot apply to the negotiated settlement between Fauji Foundation and the landowner of the \nproject site, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy requires that appropriate compensation be \nprovided to persons displaced by a project. Recognizing that the families have no assets, Fauji \nFoundation has agreed to provide assistance to the families displaced by the willing buyer-\nwilling seller based purchase of the land required for the Project. The assistance has been \ndisbursed and is well over the cost of relocation to the nearby village and the construction of \naccommodation similar to their existing housing.  \n \nD.  Grievances and Monitoring Mechanism \n11.  Although there is no basis for formal legal proceedings regarding land acquisition in the \ncase of the Project, those affected will have recourse to hearing of any complaints through the \ntribal leaders and councils (sardars, jirgas), and government officials (Nazim). As part of its \ncommunity outreach activities, Fauji Foundation will ascertain that the welfare of the families \n ", "Appendix 7   49\nwho have had to relocate has not been adversely affected by the move, and will report such \nfindings to ADB. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20071114164402+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20071114161246+08'00'", "Title": "Daharki Power Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "ABP", "Keywords": "rrp:pakistan 41903,pakistani energy sector, dhaki power project", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)"}}
