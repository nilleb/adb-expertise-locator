The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE, SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n2. \nPakistan faces an acute shortage of power. In addition, private investment in the power \nsector  is  hampered  e.g.  by  concerns  over  investment  returns  and  previous  Government \nattempts to reduce tariffs agreed with independent power producers (IPPs). As a result, scarce \nindigenous  fuel  resources  that  could  be  used  for  power  generation  are  lying  idle,  and  much-\nneeded increases in generation capacity are delayed. The  Project will play an important part in \naddressing these issues, both in its own right and as an example for others. \n \n3. \nADB has worked closely with the Government\u2019s Private Power and Infrastructure Board \n(PPIB)  to  identify  which  of  several  power  projects  being  considered  would  benefit  most  from \nassistance provided via ADB\u2019s non-sovereign financing window and match ADB\u2019s priorities for \npower  and  private  sector  development  in  Pakistan.  Given  the  excellent  working  relationship \nbetween Fauji Foundation and ADB in three previous projects,2 Fauji Foundation asked ADB to \ninvest in the Project. The Project received concept clearance in February 20073 and a mandate \nagreement was signed in March 2007. Due diligence missions were fielded in March and June \n2007. \n \nA. \n\nElectricity Demand\u2013Supply Gap \n\n4. \nDespite wide-ranging power sector reforms, Pakistan has one of the lowest levels of per-\ncapita  power  consumption  in  the  world  (413kWh).  This  compares  with  497kWh  in  the \nPhilippines  and  1,414kWh  in  Thailand.  Only  55%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  has  access  to \nelectricity  from  the  national  grid.  The  remainder  of  the  population  uses  kerosene,  wood,  and \nother bio-fuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. A growing population and a thriving economy \nmean  that  demand  for  electricity  is  always  accelerating.  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  consumption \nincreased at a compound average growth rate of 6.8% from 2001 to 2006, with faster rates of \ngrowth  among  residential,  commercial,  agricultural  and  industrial  users.  The  average  annual \ngrowth  in  electricity  demand,  at  8.3%  per  annum,  exceeds  recent  economic  growth  rates  of \nabout  6%.  Continued  strong  economic  growth  is  expected  to  increase  annual  per  capita \nconsumption of electricity (see Appendix 2 for further details on Pakistan\u2019s power sector). \n \n\n                                                 \n1  To be registered in a jurisdiction acceptable to ADB. \n2   ADB. 1989.

Total  current  installed \n5. \npower generating capacity in Pakistan amounts to 19,450MW, resulting in a capacity shortfall of \n428MW by the end of 2006 and 1,329MW in 2007. To cope with expected growth in electricity \ndemand,  it  is  estimated  that  Pakistan  will  need  to  add  about  2,000MW  of  new  capacity  each \nyear  to  avoid  power  shortages.  Without  this  addition,  there  could  be  a supply  shortfall  of  15% \nwithin 2 years (Table 1). The country is already experiencing severe disruptions in power supply, \nwhich are expected to worsen. Measures to ration consumption are already being taken, such \nas forcing shops and industries to close early. Such measures will have a direct negative effect \non economic growth. \n \n\nTable 1: Power Demand and Supply Projections, 2006\u20132010 \n(MW) \n \n\n7,199 \n7,585 \n8,127 \n8,737 \n9,531 \n\n1,216 \n1,251 \n1,312 \n1,354 \n1,408 \n\nYear  Domestic  Commercial  Agriculture \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \nMW = megawatt. \na Present generation plus planned additions. \nSources: Planning Commission and Private Power Infrastructure Board, Government of Pakistan. 2006. \n \n\nIndustrial  Others \n1,035 \n1,086 \n1,159 \n1,243 \n1,341 \n\n5,891 \n6,481 \n7,252 \n8,181 \n9,267 \n\n1,763 \n1,820 \n1,893 \n1,979 \n2,079 \n\nTotal \nDemand \n15,500 \n16,600 \n17,900 \n19,600 \n21,500 \n\nFirm \nSupplya \n15,072 \n15,271 \n15,688 \n16,704 \n18,584 \n\nDemand-\nSupply \nGap \n428 \n1,329 \n2,212 \n2,896 \n2,916 \n\nGap as % \n\nof \nDemand \n\n0 \n8 \n12 \n15 \n14 \n\nB. \n\nLack of Indigenous Resources for Power Generation \n\n6. \nDiesel or furnace oil-fueled generation plants are the easiest and quickest power plants \nto  commission  because  both  types  of  fuel  are  available  on  international  markets  and  can  be \nimported. However, reliance on imported diesel or furnace oil increases dependence on external \nsupplies, adds to the generation cost (compared with hydropower and gas), and has significant \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Framework  (MTDF), \n2005\u20132010  has  therefore  identified  low-cost  energy  generation  through  indigenous  resources \n(gas, hydropower, wind and coal) as a key method of increasing power generation in Pakistan. \n \n7. \nHowever,  because  extraction  of  Pakistan\u2019s  significant  domestic  coal  resources  is \ncomplex and at an early stage, domestic coal-fired power generation is considered to be up to a \ndecade  away.  Wind  power  can  supply  only  a  limited  amount  of  future  electricity  generation, \nleaving hydropower and gas as the mainstays of domestic energy resources.  \n \n8. \nHydropower,  which  currently  represents  about  6,499MW  (33.4%)  of  total  installed \ngeneration  capacity  in  Pakistan  (almost  all  of  it  in  the  public  sector),  is  the  main  indigenous \nfuture  source  of  energy,  with  over  30  projects  in  the  pipeline.  Nevertheless,  the  lead  time  for \ndevelopment,  the  often  complicated  and  controversial  cross-border  water  usage  agreements, \nand the political, social, and environmental impacts of large dams, push additional large-scale \nhydropower generation potential well into the future, 2012\u20132015 at the earliest (Figure 1).  \n \n\n \n\n\fFigure 1: Cumulative Planned Hydropower Generation Capacity Additions, 2007\u20132020 \n(MW) \n\n \n\n3\n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\n-\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n \n\n    MW = megawatt. \n    Sources: Government of Pakistan\u2019s Least-Cost Generation Plan and Asian Development Bank analysis. \n\n \n\n \nWhile  some  75%  of  current  thermal  power  generation  in  Pakistan  is  based  on  natural \n9. \ngas, any new gas fired-power generation is constrained by the limited remaining domestic gas \nresources.  Pakistan\u2019s  major  gas  field,  Sui,  from  which  gas  is  piped  to  all  major  cities  and  to \nexisting gas-fired power plants and industries, is about 70% depleted, and at current utilization \nrates gas availability cannot be guaranteed beyond 2011. This severely limits the potential for \nnew  power  plants  using  Sui  gas.  In  the  private  sector,  most  planned  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs) that will begin by firing on gas are expected to switch to diesel or fuel oil once \nthe  gas  runs  out,  which  will  increase  the  cost  of  generation,  raise  tariffs,  and  have  negative \nenvironmental  impacts.  While  importation  of  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  is  seen  as  medium-\nterm way of diversifying the fuel mix, and an LNG import terminal is being planned near Karachi, \nthe transportation costs of the LNG will also add to generation costs.  \n \nThe discovery of a deep well in Pakistan\u2019s second largest gas field, the Mari gas field, \n10. \nnear the city of Sukkur in Sindh province, has made it possible to plan for additional gas-fired \npower supply. The Mari gas has relatively low energy content (measured in British thermal units \n[BTUs]),  which  makes  it  unsuitable  or  uneconomic  for  most  purposes,  except  for  power \ngeneration  (since  turbines  can  be  configured  to  run  on  low-BTU  gas).  Two  plants  have  been \nplanned: Daharki Power, which is the subject of this financing, and the 134MW Star Power plant, \nwhich is also under preparation. Until these plants are operational, this gas will continue to lie \nidle.4 \n \nC. \n\nPrivate Sector Involvement in Power Generation in Pakistan \n\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  benefits  of  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in \n11. \nthe  power  sector,  both  through  privatization  of  state-owned  entities  and  through  enabling  the \nprivate  sector  to  undertake  greenfield  power  generation.  The  Government  has  issued  private-\nsector-friendly  policies  on  thermal  power  generation,  in  1994,  1998,  and  2002,  and  on \nhydropower  generation  in  1995  and  2002.  These  policies  were  designed  to  create  the \nconditions to encourage the private sector to construct, own, and operate power generation and \ntransmission  assets.  To  facilitate  such  investments,  the  PPIB  was  created  in  1994  under  the \nMinistry of Water and Power. As a result of the Ministry of Water and Power\u2019s efforts, a number \nof  IPPs  were  commissioned  under  build-own-operate  (BOO)  arrangements  in  the  late  1990s, \nand  about  30%  of  the  country\u2019s  thermal  capacity  is  now  owned  and  operated  by  the  private \n\n                                                 \n4 Daharki Power is the more advanced of the two and the sponsors of Star Power are closely monitoring its progress. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n     \n\nsector. One of these projects, the Fauji-Foundation-led 151MW Fauji Kabirwala gas-fired power \nplant  (Fauji  Kabirwala),  was  set  up  under  the  first  private  power  policy  of  1994  and  received \nADB nonsovereign financing (footnote 2). \n \n\n1. \n\nMixed Results in Implementing Policies \n\n12. \nHowever, during the late 1990s and early years of the new millennium, the Government \nattempted to lower tariffs previously agreed with the early IPPs, in order to reduce the amount of \ngovernment  finance  allocated  to  the  purchase  of  electricity.  This  was  driven  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s  inability  to  meet  its  general  financial  obligations.  This  conflict  effectively  halted \nthe development and implementation of further IPPs. After a delay of about 7 years with no new \ninvestment in IPPs, the Government embarked on a renewed initiative to promote private sector \ninvestment  in  infrastructure,  especially  in  power  generation  (and  resolved  its  previous \ndifferences with the earlier IPPs). This approach also reflected the development priorities set out \nin Pakistan\u2019s Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF). The revised power policy of 2002 \n(the 2002 policy) was designed to address issues raised by existing and potential investors.   \n \n\n2. \n\nKey Investor Issues \n\n13. \nNotwithstanding the Government\u2019s efforts, impediments to IPP development remain (and \nalmost all planned new IPPs have been badly stalled). A key issue is the question of adequate \ninvestment  returns  for  the  risk  taken.  A  recent  analytical  news  piece  explicitly  pointed  out  that \n\u201cIn the private sector, potential investors have been put off by the unrealistically low tariff offered \nby  [the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority]  WAPDA\u201d.5 WAPDA,  or  more  specifically  its  \nunbundled  transmission  and  distribution  company,  the  National  Transmission  and  Dispatch \nCorporation (NTDC), is the state-owned power off-taker for all of Pakistan (except Karachi). \n \n14. \nUnder  the  2002  policy,  the  tariff  paid  by  NTDC  to  the  IPPs  includes  a  component \nreflecting a return on the equity invested. This return component is determined by the National \nElectric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA).  In  recent  tariff  determinations  (e.g.,  for  Orient \nPower  in  December  2005,  Saif  Power  in  June  2006,  and  ARL  Power  in  November  2006), \nNEPRA  has  allowed  a  rate  of  return  on  equity  in  Pakistan  rupee  terms  of  15%.  This  rate  is  \n(i) significantly lower than the returns offered under 1994 policy, which ranged from 17% to 19%; \nand  (ii)  lower  than  the  returns  that  can  be  currently  achieved  in  other  types  of  general  equity \ninvestments.  In  view  of  these  lower-than-expected  returns,  potential  investors,  particularly \ninternational investors, have, to a large degree, opted out of investing further in IPPs in Pakistan. \nFor  example,  Globeleq,  a  major  investor  in  power  plants  in  developing  countries,  was \napproached in 2006 with regard to both Daharki Power and Orient Power, but did not invest in \neither, as the projected returns were below its corporate hurdle rate for equity investments. \n \nAnother  impediment  is  the  potential  sharing  of  interest  cost  savings.  Under  the  same \n15. \n2002  policy  tariff  regime,  the  interest  cost  is  passed  straight  on  by  the  investor  to  the  power \npurchaser. Any savings achieved by the investors, either through a refinancing once the project \nis completed, or through upfront negotiations with the finance providers (commercial banks), are \nalso  passed  straight  through.  While  this  is  intended  to  benefit  the  Government  and  the \nconsumers,  because  it  is  not  shared  with  the  investors  or  project  developers,  it  offers  no \nincentive for investors to negotiate with lenders to obtain the lowest cost of financing possible. \n\n                                                 \n5 Husain, Irfan. 2007. A Dark Future. Khaleej Times. Karachi (5 July). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThe  full  pass-through  of  savings  is  therefore  somewhat  counter-productive.  This  has  been \nrecognized by both NEPRA and PPIB, but the issue has not yet been resolved.6  \n \n16. \nSuch issues continue to hamper IPP negotiations, with the result that IPPs totaling over \n600MW that were expected to have reached financial close by now (and thus would have been \nable  to  start  construction)  have  been  delayed.  Overall,  projects  in  the  pipeline  totaling  over \n1,400MW  are  experiencing  delays.  Only  one  of  the  five  IPPs  that  were  in  PPIB\u2019s  pipeline  in \nMarch  2006  and  were  expected  to  have  been  closed  and  begun  construction  by  now  has \nactually done so (Orient Power, a 225MW oil/gas-fired plant), and only after significant delays, \nlargely because of investor reluctance over returns. Meanwhile, in the other projects, including \nDaharki Power, investors have been looking at other ways of improving equity returns. During \nsuch delays, consumers are deprived of potential additional electricity, which negatively impacts \neconomic growth and development. The holding company structure proposed for the Project will \nhelp to address these concerns about investor returns. \n \nD. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations in the Power Sector in Pakistan \n\n3. \n\nPublic Sector   \n\n17. \nADB is the major source of external investment in the energy sector in Pakistan, having \nprovided  about  one  third  of  the  total  finance  from  external  sources.  WAPDA  has  been  the \nlargest  borrower,  receiving  $1.575  billion  in  13  public  sector  loans.  The  remainder  of  ADB\u2019s \npublic  sector  financing  was  to  the  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC)  before  it  was \nprivatized (these loans were primarily for generation expansion projects and to a lesser degree \nfor  transmission  and  distribution  upgrades,  as  well  as  for  privatization).  ADB\u2019s  nonlending \nactivities  have  provided  a  total  of  $14.2  million  for  27  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects.  The \nprojects  have  covered  tariff  rationalization  and  integration,  management  information  systems, \npower  generation  coordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance,  institutional  strengthening \nand  restructuring,  and  privatization.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  the  Government  on  a  road \nmap  for  change  in  the  power  sector.  Based  on  this  road  map,  ADB\u2019s  indicative  public  sector \nprogram for power could reach $1.5 billion during 2006\u20132009 (Appendix 3).  \n \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector  \n\n18. \nADB has also been closely involved in the power sector in Pakistan through its Private \nSector  Operations  Department  (Appendix  4).  It  has  made  loans  and  investments  to  Fauji  Oil \nTerminal Company, an oil terminal with a handling capacity of over 10 million tons of fuel oil and \nhigh-speed  diesel  (footnote  2);  Fauji  Kabirwala,  one  of  the  first  IPPs  under  the  1994  power \npolicy  (footnote  2);  and  the  New  Bong  Escape  Project,  an  84MW  run-of-the-river  hydropower \nplant  and  the  first  hydropower  IPP  in  Pakistan  under  the  1995  hydropower  policy. 7  Most \nrecently,  ADB  approved  a  $150  million  loan  to  KESC  for  its  post-privatization  rehabilitation, \nupgrade,  and  expansion.  Support \nfurther  energy-related  projects,  especially  using \nindigenous  resources,  is  envisaged  as  a  key  component  of  ADB\u2019s  near-term  Pakistan  non-\nsovereign operations.  \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n6 Both NEPRA and PPIB claim that a decision has been taken to share  interest cost savings between investors on \nthe one hand and the Government and consumers on the other. NEPRA and PPIB agree that this should be divided  \nin the ratio of 60:40, but differ on whether the investors or the Government and consumers should receive the 60% \nshare. \n7 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f     \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  that  Pakistan\u2019s  power  consumers  will  receive \n19. \nadditional low-cost power, generated from local gas with no other economic use, and adequate \nreturn for the Project\u2019s investors. Specifically, the Project will have the following impacts:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nNarrowing  the  Electricity  Demand-Supply  gap.  The  Project  will  increase  net \nelectricity generation capacity by some 171MW (about 13% of Pakistan\u2019s current \ndemand\u2013supply  gap).  As  a  base-load  plant,  it  will  contribute  to  more  than  this \nshare in terms of actual electricity output. This will help reduce the constraints on \neconomic growth caused by power shortages. \n \nPromoting  efficient  management  of  natural  resources.  The  low-cost,  low-\nBTU domestic gas has no other economic application, and its use by the Project, \nwill  have  several  positive  economic  effects.  First  and  most  important,  it  will \nexploit  an  otherwise  idle  resource.  Second,  it  will  enable  low-cost  generation \nthrough  lower  transportation  costs  (as  the  plant  will  be  built  near  the  gas  field). \nThis gives the Project an advantage over imported LNG or other types of fuel and \npiped  gas  from  the  Sui  field.  Third,  it  will  help  reduce  Pakistan\u2019s  exposure  to \nvolatile international oil prices through continued imports of fuel oil and diesel, the \nonly viable short-term alternatives to gas as fuel for power generation. \n \nSupporting  private  sector  investment.  To  sustain  Pakistan\u2019s  current  high \neconomic  growth  rates,  the  MTDF  estimates  that  7\u20138%  of  annual  GDP  (about \n$81 billion between 2005 and 2010) needs to be invested in infrastructure. Of this, \nthe Government is able to invest only about 1.5%. The Government (with ADB\u2019s \nstrong  support)  has  been  implementing  reforms  to  encourage  public  private \npartnerships for the provision of infrastructure. It is of paramount importance that \nthe private sector is supported and encouraged to invest in IPPs. As the first gas-\nfired  IPP  to  reach  financial  closure  under  the  2002  policy,  the  Project  will  set  a \nbenchmark for other IPPs and encourage domestic and international investors to \nagain look at power generation as an attractive investment opportunity. \n\n \nB. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nOverview and Timeline \n\n20. \nThe  Project  consists  of  a  171MW  combined  cycle  low-BTU  gas-fired  power  plant  in \nDaharki, District Ghotki, Sindh province, in Pakistan. It is expected to be a base load plant with \n100%  dispatch  because  of  its  low-cost  tariff.  The  sponsor,  the  Fauji  Foundation,  received  a \nLetter of Interest to develop the Project using a BOO structure under the 2002 policy from the \nPPIB  in  August  2004.  The  feasibility  study  by  the  Project\u2019s  technical  consultants,  Fichtner \nGmbH,  was  completed  in  July  2005.  Fauji  Foundation  filed  its  tariff  petition  with  NEPRA  in \nJanuary  2006  and,  following  public  hearings  in  August  2006,  NEPRA  notified  the  determined \ntariff  in  October  2006.  An  engineering,  procurement  and  construction  (EPC)  contract  for  the \nmain  aspects  of  the  project  was  signed  in  February  2007.  The  Project  is  expected  to  reach \nfinancial closure by fourth quarter of 2007, and is expected to reach its commercial operations \ndate by the fourth quarter of 2009. \n \n\n6 \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n2. \n\nConfiguration and Main Components \n\n21. \nThe  plant  will  have  one  gas  turbine  of  121.5MW,  one  heat  recovery  steam  generator, \nand one steam turbine of 62.8MW. A 15-km gas transmission pipeline will be built to supply gas \nto the Project complex, and power from the Project will be evacuated to NTDC\u2019s 220kV Daharki-\nRohri transmission line.8 Housing for staff will also be constructed on the Project\u2019s premises. \n \n\n3. \n\nSponsors and Ownership \n\n22. \nFauji Foundation will act as sponsor for the Project and will directly own between 51% \nand 75% (it may allocate residual stakes up to its 75% shareholding to its controlled subsidiaries) \nof the equity. It will also counterguarantee the financial obligations of the holding company that \nare  proposed  to  be  guaranteed  by  ADB  (see  below  under  ADB\u2019s  Equity  Investment  and \nGuarantee). \n \n23. \nFauji Foundation was established as a charitable trust in 1954, and operates on a self- \nsustaining basis, channeling about 80% of the profits from its commercial ventures into welfare \nprograms for ex-servicemen and their eligible dependents, about 7% of the country\u2019s population. \n \n24. \nFauji Foundation\u2019s portfolio includes ventures in fertilizer production, power generation, \npetroleum  product  distribution,  cement  production,  grains  and  sugars,  and  services,  among \nothers.  Its  earnings  from  operations  in  FY2006  were  PRs3.3  billion,  on  an  asset  base  of \nPRs44.3 billion.  \n \nFauji  Foundation  has  prior  experience  of  owning,  managing  and  operating  a  low-BTU \n25. \ngas-fired  combined  cycle  power  plant  in  Pakistan.  It  is  the  largest  owner  (45.33%)  of  Fauji \nKabirwala,  established  in  1997  in  collaboration  with  El  Paso  Energy  International  and  ADB, \nwhich  also  provided  a  loan  to  the  project  (footnote  2).  Another  international  power  company, \nGlobeleq,  bought  El  Paso\u2019s  shares  (as  part  of  an  acquisition  of  all  of  El  Paso\u2019s  non-domestic \npower  assets)  in  2006  and  Globeleq  has  a  shareholding  of  42.17%.  ADB  retains  a  minority \nequity  interest  of  12.5%.  The  plant  is  well  managed.  In  addition  to  Fauji  Kabirwala,  Fauji \nFoundation  has  also  been  a  sponsor  in  two  other  ADB-supported  projects,  Fauji  Fertilizer \nCompany Limited and Fauji Oil Terminal Company Limited (footnote 2). \n \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policy Aspects  \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n26. \nPlants  such  as  Daharki  Power  that  operate  only  on  natural  gas  and  do  not  use  such \nalternate  fuels  as  residual  furnace  oil  or  diesel  are  among  the  most  environmentally-friendly \nthermal power options available. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) has assessed the \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project  in  relation  to  both \nPakistani  legislation  and  World  Bank  guidelines  applicable  to  new  thermal  power  plants.  The \nrequired  no-objection  certificate  from  the  Sindh  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Agency, \ngranted  on  10  February  2007,  followed  public  hearings  in  Karachi  and  Daharki.  The  local \nadministration supported the Project and there was no adverse public reaction. \n                                                 \n8   This  transmission  line  will  be  financed  by  the  second  tranche  of  ADB\u2019s  multitranche  financing  facility  for  Power \nTransmission  Enhancement  approved  in  December  2006  (ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of \nPakistan  for  Power  Transmission  Enhancement.  Manila).  This  was  confirmed  to  the  due  diligence  mission  by \nNTDC. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n     \n\n \n27. \nThe  Project  will  be  constructed  in  an  area  of  unproductive  saline  land.  No  sensitive \nhabitats with high ecological value were found during the field survey and no adverse impacts \nare expected as a result of project operations. As the site is close to a water canal, no ground \nwater will be mined (as is common practice for power plants), thus avoiding possible negative \nimpacts on subsurface aquifers. Similarly, the impact on surface water bodies is expected to be \nslight  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  requirement  that  wastewater  be  treated  appropriately, \nconsistent with local environmental standards, before discharge.  \n \n28. \nThe EIA concludes that the more significant impacts of the Project are expected to be on \nnoise  and  ambient  air  quality.  The  detailed  plant  design  will  contain  appropriate  technical \nmeasures  to  comply  with  relevant  noise  standards.  To  assess  ambient  air  quality,  an  air \npollutant dispersion calculation was carried out. The initial estimates showed that the expected \nimpacts on ground level concentrations for nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and particulate matter of \n10 micrometres or less in aerodynamic diameter will be minimal and no statutory limit values (as \nprescribed by the Sindh Provincial Environmental Protection Agency) will be exceeded. \n \n29. \nAn environment management plan has been prepared to ensure that the environmental \ndisturbances  associated  with  the  construction  and  operational  phases  of  the  Project  will  be \nhandled in a way that is consistent with ADB environmental guidelines. Fauji Kabirwala, based \non the same technology and managed under the same arrangements as the Project, has plant \nemissions  and  effluents  that  are  well  within  the  prescribed  standards  (all  Pakistan\u2019s  provincial \nenvironmental  protection  agencies  follow  national  environmental  quality  standards  that  are \nbased  on  World  Bank  guidelines  for  acceptable  noise,  pollution  and  effluent  discharges).  The \nEPC  contract  has  strict  penalties  for  non-compliance  with  prescribed  environmental  standards \nfor  noise  emissions  and  effluent  discharges.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  category  B.  \nThe summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Safeguards  \n\n30. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  as  four  families  have  been \ndisplaced from land that has been sold to Fauji Foundation by the previous landowner through a \nnegotiated  settlement.  The  families,  comprising  17  individuals,  had  been  living  as  agricultural \nlaborers  on  the  land  in  housing  provided  by  the  previous  landowner.  The  employment \nopportunities of the households will remain unaffected as they will continue to work the lands of \nthe landowner and others. Agreement has been reached with the elders of the adjacent village, \nMitho Lakhan, for the families to be relocated to that village. The affected families were provided \nwith  sufficient  cash  assistance  to  allow  them  to  relocate  and  construct  proper  replacement \nhousing. The due diligence report is in Appendix 7.  \n \n31. \nclassified as category C under the ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \n\nThe Project site does not affect any indigenous peoples. Consequently, the Project is \n\nIV. \n\nADB EQUITY INVESTMENT AND GUARANTEE \n\n \nA. \n\nJustification \n\n1. \n\nThe Project is Consistent with ADB and Government Strategies \n\n32. \nThe proposed assistance is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and sector strategies, as well \nas with the Government\u2019s strategic intentions. ADB\u2019s most recent country strategy and program \nupdate reports  that  \u201cADB  views  itself  as  one  of  Pakistan\u2019s  strategic  development  partners  for \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ninfrastructure development,\u201d with power as one of the main areas of support. It also notes that \n\u201cthe emphasis on lending for economic infrastructure will be continued, which is consistent with \nthe high priority attached to it in the Government\u2019s medium-term development framework.\u201d9 The \nreport clearly mandates ADB to promote the role of the private sector as a driver of investment, \ngrowth, and employment. Among ADB\u2019s focus sectors for private sector operations, power and \nenergy infrastructure feature prominently. \n \n33. \nAs part of its public sector program, ADB has a strong energy sector focus in Pakistan. \nWork on the enabling environment, reform, and regulations have created the right conditions for \nfurther public sector investment, as well as more private sector participation. In the short term, \nADB is helping the Government conduct energy sector analyses; capacity building; and project \nidentification,  development,  and  implementation.  Over  the  medium  term,  ADB  is  supporting \nlarge  infrastructure  development  projects  in  renewable  energy  and  power  transmission  and \ndistribution. \n \nThe  energy sector is  a core  operational  sector under  ADB\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  II.10 \n34. \nCatalyzing  investments  through  increased  private  sector  participation  in  ADB\u2019s  developing \nmember  countries  is  identified  in  the  medium-term  strategy  II  as  one  of  the  five  strategic \npriorities. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy11 designates the following as two of the most important \noperational priorities: (i) reducing poverty by, among other things, creating energy infrastructure \nfor sustainable economic growth; and (ii) promoting private sector involvement by restructuring \nthe  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  private  investors,  especially  in \ngeneration. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages ADB interventions to increase private \nsector participation in the energy sector to take advantage of the higher operational efficiencies \nthat private operators can achieve and to meet the large capital requirements. \n \n35. \nADB  is  also  fully  engaged  with  the  private  power  subsector  in  Pakistan,  through  loans \nand  investments  made  since  1996.  This  includes  the  successful12 Fauji  Kabirwala  Project  and \nmore  recently,  the  $150  million  loan  to  the  KESC  as  well  as  the  loan  to  New  Bong  Escape, \nPakistan\u2019s first hydropower IPP (footnote 8). ADB is currently considering several other power \nfinancing opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in projects with low environmental impact (such \nas run-of-the-river hydropower schemes, wind power, and biogas).  \n \n36. \nSince  Daharki  Power  will  be  the  first  gas-only  IPP  to  reach  financial  closure  under  the \n2002 policy, ADB\u2019s support will send a strong signal to potential local and foreign investors and \nthus help provide impetus to the Government\u2019s plans to expand electricity generation capacity to \nmeet  the  growing  energy  deficit.  ADB\u2019s  equity  participation  will  also  enhance  the  governance \nprofile of the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Project has Important Demonstration Effects for Further Investment in \nthe Sector  \n\n37. \nOne of the main reasons why there have been no new international investment in IPPs \nin  Pakistan  in  the  last  7  years  is  the  low  return  offered  to  shareholders  under  government  \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2005.

The  PCR  rated  the  Project  as  successful  because  of  its  strong  operational  performance.  The \noverall financial internal rate of return on the project was estimated at 17%, and for ADB\u2019s equity, if realized, almost \n23%). The project has been, and continues to be, in full compliance with all stipulated covenants. It has a strong \ndebt repayment track record and at present is risk-rated good (RR-2).  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n     \n\npolicies,  including  the  2002  policy.  The  enhanced  returns  are  likely  to  make  both  this  Project \nand other similar projects significantly more appealing to investors. By providing the guarantee, \nADB is helping to set a precedent for future power sector financings in Pakistan, highlighting the \nneed for an adequate risk-reward structure. This may lead either to (i) replications of leveraged \nholding company structures, and/or (ii) a realization among policy makers the balance between \nrisks and rewards needs to be adequately addressed.   \n \n38. \nAt the same time, this structure, which is routinely used in international utility financing, \nbut  represents  a  significant  market  innovation in  Pakistan, will  enable  the  Project  to  go  ahead \n(and  therefore  to  address  the  looming  power  deficit)  in  spite  of  customary  time  lags  in  policy \nformulation  and  implementation,  and  without  additional  cost  to  the  Government  or  the \nconsumers.  Upon  learning  of  the  guarantee  structure,  Fauji  Foundation\u2019s  original  joint  venture \npartner, Globeleq, indicated renewed interest (although shortly thereafter this was overtaken by \nits decision to make an overall exit from Asia, which precluded any further investment).  \n \nB. \n\nCorporate Governance, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n39. \nBoth  the  holding  company  and  the  project  company  will  have  the  same  governance \nstructure, and ADB will have the right to representation on the respective boards of directors in \nproportion  to  its  shareholding.  In  addition,  for  minority  protection  and  ADB  policy  compliance, \nADB  will  have  veto  rights  over  a  number  of  major  decisions  affecting  the  companies.  Fauji \nFoundation and ADB have agreed to explore the possibility of appointing independent directors \nto the boards, in anticipation of a potential future public listing. The boards will meet bi-monthly \nduring \nits  board \nmemberships,  ADB  will  be  able  to  monitor  closely  FPCDL\u2019s  progress  vis-\u00e0-vis  agreed-upon \nmilestones and the financial model. The holding company will be required to follow international \nfinancial  reporting  standards,  and  the  project  company  will  adhere  to  generally  accepted \naccounting  standards  in  Pakistan.  Both  companies  will  be  audited  by  accounting  firms \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nC. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nimplementation  phase  and  quarterly \n\nthereafter.  Through \n\nthe  project \n\nBoth  as  a  shareholder  and  as  a  guarantee  provider,  ADB  will  require  the  holding \n40. \ncompany to provide comprehensive reports that detail: (i) progress in the implementation of the \nProject, (ii) the operating cost structure and operating performance, and (iii) the achievement of \nestimated returns. Appendix 1 provides the performance indicators. \n \nD. \n\nProject Review \n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  regularly  as  per  standard  ADB  portfolio  management  and \nProject evaluation practice, including a project completion report (following the completion of the \nProject envisaged in April 2009) and annual reviews. \n \nE. \n\nDocumentation \n\n42. \nStandard  documentation  for  a  transaction  of  this  kind  will  be  prepared,  including  a \nsubscription  agreement,  a  shareholders\u2019  agreement,  a  put  option  agreement,  a  guarantee,  a \ncounterguarantee and such other agreements as may be necessary. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nF. \n\nCompliance with ADB Investment Limitations \n\n43. \nThis  investment  will  represent  1.26%  of  the  total  ADB  nonsovereign  portfolio  and  will \nincrease  ADB\u2019s  exposure  to  the  \u201cConventional  Energy  Generation\u201d  sector  from  12.58%  to \n13.67%.  It  will  increase  ADB\u2019s  non-sovereign  portfolio  exposure  to  Pakistan  from  8.14%  to \n9.28%.  \n \n44. \nThe  proposed  equity  investment  and  the  proposed  ADB  guarantee  each  constitute \nexposure  to  the  holding  company.  Since  the  amount  of  the  investment  and  the  guarantee \ncombined exceeds 25% of the total value of the assets of the holding company, the exposure \nlimits  set  by  applicable  ADB  policy 13  for  a  single  financing  recipient  would  be  exceeded. \nHowever, since the guarantee undertakings of ADB (which constitute approximately 95% of the \nnet exposure of ADB to the transaction) are in turn counterguaranteed by Fauji Foundation, and \nthe  obligations  of  Fauji  Foundation  under  its  counterguarantee  are  secured,  Management \nconsiders  that  this  strongly  mitigates  the  risks  inherent  in  such  exposure.  The  proposed \nassistance complies with all other ADB prudential exposure limits. \n \nG. \n\nAnticorruption  Measures:  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  \n\nFauji Foundation was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \n45. \nand  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  will  require  the  holding  company  and  the  project  company  to  institute,  maintain,  and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \npreventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Further,  the \nholding company and the lenders of the guaranteed loan to the holding company will covenant \nwith  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  Such  obligations  will  be  contained  in  the \nADB investment and guarantee documentation. The investment and guarantee documentation \nbetween ADB, Fauji Foundation, and the holding company will further allow ADB to investigate \nany violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCE \n\n \n46. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to ADB\u2019s proposed assistance. \nNo  funding  will  be  disbursed  and  the  guarantee  will  not  be  effective  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed financing would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \n\n \n47. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\nan  equity  investment  of  up  to  (a)  $2,750,000  or  (b)  25%  of  the  issued  share \ncapital in the holding company of  Foundation Power Company Daharki Limited, \nwhichever is lower; \n\na guarantee in a principal amount of up to $44,000,000 plus interest, in favor of \nthe lenders to the holding company;   \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2007.

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), which was constituted as an \nindependent  entity,  is  exclusively  empowered  under  the  act  and  related  rules  to  regulate  all \nfacets of the power sector, including the electricity tariffs charged by the Karachi Electric Supply \nCorporation  (KESC).  NEPRA  is  thus  empowered  to  (i)  grant  licenses  for  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution;  (ii)  approve  tariffs,  rates,  and  charges  across  the  sector;  \n(iii) establish uniform industry performance via codes and standards; and (iv) enforce the above. \nNEPRA,  although  mandated  as  an  independent  entity,  is  governed  by  a  chairman  and  four \nmembers,  all  of  whom  are  appointed  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan  with  the  members \nrecommended by, and representing, provincial interests. \n \nframeworks  are  developed  and \n2. \nimplemented by the Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated \nthe  process  of  power  sector  reforms  and  restructuring  in  the  early  1990s  on  the  advice  of  the \nWorld  Bank.  The  reforms,  developed  in  various  stages  and  through  different  initiatives,  are \nreflected in several policies, including the 1994 power policy, the 1995  hydropower policy, the \n1995  transmission  line  policy,  the  1998  power  policy,  and  the  2002  power  policy  (the  policy \nunder  which  the  Daharki  Power  Project  is  being  developed).  These  were  designed,  to  a  large \nextent, to attract private sector participation in the restructured power sector. The Government is \nalso  unbundling  the  Pakistan  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  into  various \nindependent entities. The broad objectives of these policies have been to: (i) bring efficiencies \nacross  the  entire  sector  via  competitive  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  with \nappropriate  independent  regulatory  oversight;  (ii)  rationalize  prices  and  subsidies;  and  \n(iii)  encourage  private  capital  formation  and  investment  to  meet  growing  electricity  demand.  \nThe privatization of KESC was a key element in this ongoing program. \n \n3. \nThe power sector continues to be in transition and is today semi-privatized and fairly well \nregulated. The sector has historically been characterized by very significant Government control \nthrough  the  WAPDA  and  KESC  monopolies  (which  function  as  vertically  integrated  utilities \nencompassing  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution)  and  by  significant  inefficiency,  with \nlosses  in  excess  of  25%,  and  an  inability  to  meet  demand.  This  has  changed  over  the  last \ndecade, at least in terms of outright government control, and Pakistan today enjoys significant \nprivate-sector-led generation through 21 independent power producers (IPPs), 19 of which were \nsanctioned under the 1994 power policy,1 and which together represent more than 30% of total \ngeneration  capacity.  With  ADB\u2019s  active  assistance2,  KESC  was  privatized  in  late  2005  and  to \ndate  remains  the  only  vertically  integrated  private  sector  entity  in  charge  of  the  majority  of  its \ngeneration  and  all  of  its  transmission  and  distribution.    As  of  December  2006,  some  40%  of \nPakistan\u2019s installed generation capacity was owned by the private sector (through the IPPs and \nKESC).  This  percentage  is  likely  to  increase,  with  planned  privatizations  of  Jamshoro  Power \nCompany and a secondary public offering of Kot Addu Power Company. The evident success in \nattracting private sector investment into power generation was not without difficulties, and most \nIPPs,  especially  those  under  the  1994  power  policy,  ended  up  in  contract  disputes  with  the \n                                                 \n1  Hub Power Company, a 1,292MW power plant, was actually under development prior to the 1994 power policy and \n\n2   ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nGovernment and WAPDA, some of which were acrimonious. These disputes were largely driven \nby significant overcapacity in the mid- to late 1990s (the exact opposite situation to today) and \nconsequent  tariff  implications.  Notwithstanding  this  discord,  these  disputes  were  ultimately \nsettled  amicably,  with  minimal  adjustments  to  the  contracts.  The  terms  of  the  contracts, \nalthough  renegotiated,  were  ultimately  honored,  which  provides  a  degree  of  comfort  in  the \npresent investment environment. \n \n4. \nSignificant  power  sector  reforms  supported  by  multilateral  development  banks  are \nunderway with the aim of unbundling WAPDA\u2019s power wing into many discrete generation and \ndistribution units, and by placing WAPDA\u2019s transmission assets into a single corporatized entity, \nthe National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). NTDC was incorporated in \n1998 and is responsible for power transmission in all of Pakistan, apart from the areas served \nby KESC. NTDC, which operates transmission lines of 66, 132, 220 and 500 kVs now  assumes \nthe  additional  function  of  acting  as  the  single  buyer  of  wholesale  generation  from  many \ncompanies  including  IPPs  (but  excluding  KESC)  for  onward  transmission  and  sale  to  eight \ndistribution entities. These companies include the Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Islamabad, \nMultan, Peshwar, Hyderabad and Quetta Electric Supply Companies, most commonly known as \nDISCOs.  It  is  likely  that  the  power  from  Daharki  Power  will  be  evacuated  by  NTDC  to  the \nHyderabad DISCO. At present a \u201csingly buyer\u2013single seller\u201d model is being put in place, which \nthe  Government  hopes,  as  more  investment  flows  into  the  power  sector,  will  evolve  into  a \n\u201cmultiple buyer\u2013multiple seller\u201d regime where generators and distributors can contract directly. \n \nB. \n\nTariff Structure \n\nThe  retail  tariff  regime  in  Pakistan  is  based  on  different  classes  of  consumers,  \n5. \n(e.g.,  residential,  industrial,  and  commercial)  and  graduated. 3  It  includes  significant  cross \nsubsidies.  NEPRA  is  responsible  for  determining  tariffs  under  its  Tariff  Standards  and \nProcedures  Rules,  1998  which  specify  standards  by  which  tariffs  are  set,  and  procedures  by \nwhich they are adjudicated. These standards are sufficiently broad to allow discretion and thus \nenable  the  development  of  various  tariff  regimes.  Tariff  determinations  are  based  on  the \nprinciple  of  recovering  prudently  incurred  costs  and  returns  on  the  applicant\u2019s  rate  base, \napplicable  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  They  contain  automatic  quarterly  increases  to  reflect \nchanges  in  fuel  costs  or  purchased  power  costs,  in  addition  to  macroeconomic  indexation  of \ncosts. NEPRA\u2019s tariffs become effective once they are officially notified by the Government in its \nofficial gazette.  \n \n6. \nA2.1. \n \n\nAverage end-user tariffs for eight ex-WAPDA DISCOs and KESC are depicted in Table \n\nTable A2.1: Average Electricity Tariffs, 2001\u20132006 \n(Paisa/ kWh) \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\nCAGR (%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n\n \n\n \n \n\nDISCOs \nKESC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n299 \n406 \n\n \n\n \n\n373 \n454 \n\n \n\n \n\n395 \n472 \n\n384 \n500 \n\n \n\nN/A \n543 \n\n \n\nN/A \n587 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.6 \n7.6 \n\nCAGR  =  compound  average  growth  rate,  KESC  =  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation,  DISCOs  =  ex-WAPDA \ndistribution companies.     \nSource: KESC and NEPRA Annual Report 2005.  \n\n                                                 \n3  Tariffs are charged on a tier basis. The first tier is 100 kwh; next is 300 kwh, 700 kwh and then so on. As the Kwh \n\nconsumption increases, so does the tier or slab rate. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n17\n\n \n\n  \n\nIn  order  to  grant  greater  financial  independence  to  the  newly  formed  generators  and \n7. \nDISCOs (spun out of WAPDA), and to reduce tariff subsidies to WAPDA in fiscal year (FY) 2006, \nthe subsidy requested by WAPDA was $1.316 billion. The Government recently announced an \nunanticipated  10%  electricity  tariff  increase.  At  present  the  end  tariff  charged  by  DISCOs  is \nheavily  subsidized,  based  on  WAPDA\u2019s  overall  generation  cost.  This,  coupled  with  high \ntransmission  and  distribution  losses  (primarily  because  of  underinvestment  in  the  network, \nresulted in an increasing financial burden for WAPDA as well as for the DISCOs). The gravity of \nthe situation can be seen in the number of days payable to IPPs (which sell power to WAPDA \nthrough  NTDC,  which  has  of  late  been  two  months.  The  recent  tariff  increase  has  been \nwelcomed by IPPs and by industry participants including commercial financiers which see this \nas  a  first  step  by  the  Government  to  make  WAPDA  solvent  in  advance  of  its  eventual \nprivatization, which has been on hold since 2000.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nPakistan\u2019s electricity consumption grew at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of \n6.8%  from  2001  to  2006,  and  amounted  to  67,603  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  at  the  end  of  2006. \nThis  growth  is  being  driven  across  all  classes  of  consumers  (except  bulk  supply/other)  but \nespecially by commercial, agricultural, industrial and domestic or residential consumers, which \nregistered  CAGRs  of  11.3%,  10.1%,  6.7%  and  6.2%  respectively,  in  the  same  time  period. \nConsumption has continued to grow on the back of recent annual economic growth rates of over \n7%, and similar growth rates in electricity demand are expected to continue in the near future \nbased  on  projections  for  continued  strong  economic  growth  and  higher  rates  of  per  capita \nelectricity consumption. \n \n9. \n \n\nTable A2.2 illustrates Pakistan\u2019s electricity demand and growth rates. \n\nElectricity Demand \n\nTable A2.2: Breakdown of Electricity Demand, 2001\u20132006 \n(GWh) \n \n\nClass \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\nCAGR (%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDomestic \nCommercial  \nIndustrial  \nAgriculture \nPublic Lighting \nOther \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n22,765 \n2,774 \n14,349 \n4924 \n213 \n3,559 \n48,584 \n\n \n\n23,210\n2,951\n15,141\n5,607\n212\n3,501\n50,622\n\n \n\n23,624\n3,218\n16,181\n6,016\n244\n3,373\n52,656\n\n \n\n25,846\n3,689\n17,366\n6,669\n262\n3,658\n57,490\n\n \n\n \n\n27,601 \n4,080 \n18,591 \n6,988 \n305 \n3,762 \n61,327 \n\n \n\n \n\n30,720 \n4,730 \n19,803 \n7,949 \n353 \n4,048 \n67,603 \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2\n11.3\n6.7\n10.1\n10.6\n2.6\n6.8%\n\n \n\nElectricity Supply \n\nCAGR = compound average growth rate, GWh = gigawatt-hour. \nSource: Pakistan Energy Yearbook 2006. \n \nD. \n \nTotal installed power generating capacity in Pakistan amounts to 19,450 MW, of which \n10. \n11,369  MW  is  provided  by  WAPDA  (58.4%),  5,833  MW  by  IPPs  (30%),  1,756  MW  by  KESC \n(9%), 30 MW by AJK Hydro Electric Board (0.2%), and the remaining 462 MW by Government-\nowned  nuclear  power  plants  (2.4%).

Set  up  in  1994, \nPPIB acts as a \u201cone-window\u201d operation to facilitate private investment in IPPs under the national \npower  and  hydropower  policies.  Given  the  enormous  power  requirements  and  Government\u2019s \npolicy for encouraging private sector participation in power generation, PPIB is expected to play \nan important part in mobilizing investments into new thermal and hydropower generation, as it \ndid in the mid and late 1990s.4   \n \nAgainst 19,450 MW of installed capacity in Pakistan, the firm supply at the end of 2006 \n13. \nwas 15,072 MW. By comparison, peak demand for 2006 was 15,483 MW, which resulted in a \ndeficit of about 411 MW. Assuming no additional capacity is added, PPIB forecasts the following \nrelationship between peak demand and firm supply for the next 7 years (Table A2.4). \n\n \nTable A2.4: Firm Supply Versus Peak Demand Projections, 2007\u20132013 \n(MW) \n \n\nFirm Supplya Peak Demand Surplus / (Deficit) \n\nYear \n\n \n\n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n\n \n\n15,091 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n\n16,548 \n17,689 \n19,080 \n20,584 \n22,205 \n23,953 \n25,840 \n\n \n\n \n\n(1,457) \n(2,634) \n(4,028) \n(5,529) \n(7,150) \n(8,899) \n(10,785) \n\n \n\n \n\n \nMW = megawatt. \na Includes KESC\u2019s generation capacity. \nSource: Private Power Infrastructure Board. \n\n \n\n \n                                                 \n4   PPIB has facilitated investments in over 15 IPPs with a combined installed capacity of 5,577 MW under the 1994 \n\nand 1998 power policies \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n19\n\n \n\n  \n\nThis  growing  power  deficit  will  particularly  affect  large  urban  centers  such  as  Karachi, \n14. \nLahore,  Faisalabad,  Sialkot,  and  Rawalpindi.  These  cities  are  home  to  most  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nindustrial assets, including most small and medium-sized enterprises, and contribute over 35% \nof  the  country\u2019s  GDP.    Recognizing  the  gravity  of  the  situation,  the  Government,  through \nWAPDA\u2019s  Power  and  Energy  Planning  wings  and  PPIB,  has  developed  several  long-term \nelectricity demand load projections and new supply options. Daharki Power features prominently \nin these projections because of its low-cost generation and base load status. In order to meet \ngrowing demands and to use Pakistan\u2019s significant water resources, especially in the northern \npart  of  the  country,  WAPDA  has  developed  a  least-cost  generation  expansion  plan,  which \nemphasizes  indigenous  sources  of  energy,  primarily  hydropower  (and  in  some  cases  coal),  in \nline with the Government\u2019s power sector policies. However, uncertainty remains about the pace \nof  this  overall  generation  expansion,  given  the  numerous  delays  experienced  to  date.  \nInvestment in hydropower IPPs is expected to gain momentum now that the arrangements for \nNew  Bong  Escape  Hydro  Power  Plant  (part-financed  by  ADB) 5  have  been  finalized. \nNevertheless,  concerns  about  the  speed  of  capacity  addition  remain.  Table  A2.5  shows \nPakistan\u2019s  power  demand  projections  relative  to  planned  capacity  additions  by  WAPDA,  IPPs \nand KESC.

Of  the  lending  to  the  power  subsector  (Table  A3.1),  64%  has  been \ndirected  to  generation  (39%  hydropower,  25%  thermal  power)  and  the  remaining  36%  to \ntransmission and distribution (T&D).  \n\n \nTable A3.1: Asian Development Bank Lending to the Power Subsector in Pakistan \n \n\nProject \n\nDate Approved \n\nLoan No. \n\n0099-PAK \n0100-PAK \n0150-PAK \n0151-PAK \n0168-PAK \n0169-PAK \n0181-PAK \n0187-PAK \n0200-PAK \n0201-PAK \n0230-PAK \n0332-PAK \n0390-PAK \n0391-PAK \n0505-PAK \n0516-PAK \n0561-PAK \n0578-PAK \n0601-PAK \n0660-PAK \n0661-PAK \n0701-PAK \n0702-PAK \n0760-PAK \n0824-PAK \n0925-PAK \n1073-PAK \n1143-PAK \n1144-PAK \n1314-PAK \n1315-PAK \n1424-PAK \n1807-PAK \n1808-PAK \n1809-PAK \n2178-PAK \n2286-PAK \n2287-PAK \n2289-PAK \n2290-PAK \n \n\nPower Generation, Transmission and Distribution \nPower Generation, Transmission and Distribution \nPower Generation, Transmission and Distribution (Supplementary) \nPower Generation, Transmission and Distribution (Supplementary) \nMangla Hydropower \nMangla Hydropower \nSui-Karachi Gas Pipeline \nSui-Karachi Gas Pipeline (Supplementary) \nTarbela Hydropower \nTarbela Hydropower \nGas Turbine Generation \nTarbela Hydropower (Supplementary and Extension) \nPipri Thermal Generation \nPipri Thermal Generation \nLoad Despatch and Transmission \nPipri II Thermal Generation \nRural Electrification Sector \nPipri II Thermal Generation (Supplementary) \nTarbela Hydropower Extension (Units 9 and 10) \nGuddu Combined Cycle \nGuddu Combined Cycle \nTarbela Hydropower Extension (Units 11 and12) \nTarbela Hydropower Extension (Units 11 and 12) \nTarbela Units 13 and 14 and 500 kV Transmission \nWAPDA Tenth Power (Sector) \nKESC Fifth Power (Sector) \nWAPDA Eleventh Power \nWAPDA Twelfth Power (Sector) \nWAPDA Twelfth Power (Sector) \nKESC Sixth Power (Sector) \nKESC Sixth Power (Sector) \nGhazi Barotha Hydropower \nEnergy Sector Restructuring Program \nEnergy Sector Restructuring Program \nCapacity Enhancement in the Energy Sector \nInfrastructure Development Project \nRenewable Energy Development Sector Investment Program \nRenewable Energy Development Sector Investment Program \nPower Transmission Enhancement Investment Program \nPower Transmission Enhancement Investment Program \nTotal \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n14.3 \n12.2 \n6.8 \n2.2 \n3.9 \n12.8 \n29.7 \n23.5 \n34.0 \n13.0 \n22.0 \n38.0 \n35.0 \n25.0 \n67.0 \n55.0 \n35.0 \n29.0 \n29.0 \n83.4 \n57.5 \n137.2 \n31.8 \n117.8 \n150.0 \n100.0 \n215.0 \n125.0 \n125.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n300.0 \n300.0 \n50.0 \n5.0 \n25.0 \n500.0 \n10.0 \n790.0 \n10.0 \n3,820.1 \n\n12 Oct 1972 \n12 Oct 1972 \n22 Nov 1973 \n22 Nov 1973 \n17 Dec 1973 \n17 Dec 1973 \n14 Mar 1974 \n06 Aug 1974 \n28 Nov 1974 \n28 Nov 1974 \n26 Aug 1975 \n15 Dec 1977 \n22 Dec 1978 \n22 Dec 1978 \n22 Dec 1980 \n23 Jun 1981 \n15 Dec 1981 \n29 Jul 1982 \n23 Nov 1982 \n06 Dec 1983 \n06 Dec 1983 \n25 Oct 1984 \n25 Oct 1984 \n28 Nov 1985 \n18 Dec 1986 \n24 Nov 1988 \n20 Dec 1990 \n13 Dec 1991 \n13 Dec 1991 \n22 Sep 1994 \n22 Sep 1994 \n16 Jan 1996 \n14 Dec 2000 \n14 Dec 2000 \n14 Dec 2000 \n18 Aug 2005 \n13 Dec 2006 \n13 Dec 2006 \n13 Dec 2006 \n13 Dec 2006 \n \n\nPAK = Pakistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPakistan\u2019s  most  recent  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2006\u20132008)1 supports  a \n2. \nstrategic  focus  on  energy  sector  reforms  to  bring  clarity  on the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all \nstakeholders  including  the  Government,  the  regulator,  and  the  private  sector  in  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity.

The Project will \nuse  a  dedicated  gas  supply  from  Mari  gas  fields.  It  will  be  the  first  natural-gas-only  plant \ndeveloped under the Government\u2019s 2002 power policy and will be undertaken according to a 25-\nyear build-own-operate (BOO) structure. A feasibility study by Fichtner GmbH was completed in \nJuly 2005. The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) provided no objection clearance \nfor  the  Project  on  10  February  2007,  based  on  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA) \nprepared in 2005.1  \n \n2. \nThis summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) has been prepared for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in line  with its environmental and social safeguard policies, and the \ninformation  disclosure  requirements  for  an  environmental  category  B  project.    The  SIEE  is \nbased on the EIA and supplementary information.  \n \n3. \nOnly  four  families,  comprising  17  individuals,  living  as  agricultural  laborers  on  the  land \nacquired  by  Fauji  Foundation2 on  a  willing  buyer\u2013willing  seller  basis,  will  be  affected  by  the \ntransaction. Agreement has been reached with the adjoining village that the displaced families \nwill  be  allowed  to  relocate  to  the  village.  The  families  will  continue  their  occupation  as \nagricultural  laborers  on  new  lands  acquired  by  the  landowner  in  the  immediate  vicinity.  There \nare no indigenous peoples living in the surrounding area.  \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s  review  of  the  Project  covered  environmental,  health  and  safety  and  social \ninformation  submitted  by  Fauji  Foundation,  the  National  Transmission  Distribution  Corporation \n(NTDC), site visits by an ADB mission to the project site in March 2007, and discussions with \nFauji Foundation, Mari Gas Company Limited (MGCL), and NTDC officials.  \n \nB. \n \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nTechnical Features \n\n \n5. \nFauji  Foundation  is  the  sponsor  for  the  Project  and  has  prior  experience  owning, \nmanaging and operating a low-BTU gas-fired combined cycle power plant in Pakistan.

A  15-km  gas  transmission  pipeline  will  be \nbuilt  to  supply  gas  to  the  project  complex,  and  power  from  the  Project  will  be  evacuated  to \nNTDC\u2019s  220  Kv  Daharki\u2013Rohri  transmission  line.  Housing  for  staff  will  be  constructed  on  the \nProject\u2019s premises.  \n \n7. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  under  an  engineering,  procurement  and  construction \n(EPC)  contract,  combining  detailed  design,  construction  and  supply  and  installation  of \nequipment and commissioning.  The EPC contract was awarded to Doosan Heavy Industries & \nConstruction  Co  Ltd.  in  February  2007.  Construction  is  expected  to  be  completed  within  24 \nmonths  of  Doosan  receiving  notice  to  proceed.  Doosan  will  also  provide  a  24-month  warranty \ncovering power plant, equipment and works from full commissioning of the Project.  \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nProject Area \n\n \n8. \nThe project area of 132.44 acres has been acquired from a single landowner. The study \narea for the EIA covered the land and an area of 1-2 km2 around the project site. The project \nsite is along Dad Lagari road, about 8.5 km south of the city of Daharki.  \n \nD. \n \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysiography and Soil \n\n \n9. \ncomposed of alternating layers of silty clay and clay. \n \n\nThe topography of the area is generally flat. The soil is generally alluvial in nature and is \n\nClimate \n\n2. \n \n10. \nThe  climate  of  the  project  area  is  arid  subtropical,  characterized  by  hot  summers  and \nmild winters. The closest meteorological observatory is at Rohri, Sukkur District, about 110 km \nfrom the site. May, June, and July are the hottest months. August and September are hot, with \nhigh humidity. The winter months are December, January and February.  The mean maximum \ntemperature  during  summer  is  44oC  and  the  mean  minimum  is  29oC.  During  winter  the  mean \nmaximum temperature is about 23 oC and the mean minimum is 9oC.    \n \n11. \nThe average annual rainfall of the area is 122 mm, with mean annual relative humidity of \n52% and a wind speed of 80 km/hr with a north-east prevailing wind direction. Frost is common, \nand occurs during December and January. Meteorological data are presented in Table A8.1. \n \n\n3. \n\nAir Quality \n\n \n12. \nThe  EIA  includes  the  results  of  the  ambient  air  quality  monitoring  measurements  were \ncarried  out at  10  locations  from  29-31  May  2007.  Results show  that  SO2,  NO2 and  CO  values \nare within limits as prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO). However, PM10 values are \nhigh (173 to 190 ug/m3) because of the proximity to desert areas. The results of the ambient air \nquality  are  shown  in  Table  A8.2.  The  air  emission  standards  of  the  World  Bank  and  the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency of Pakistan are presented in Table A8.3.   \n \n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                       Appendix 6      \n\n29\n\n4. \n\nNoise Level \n\n \n13. \nThe  project  area  can  be  classified  as  noise-free  because  of  the  virtual  absence  of \nvehicular  traffic,  and  industrial  and  commercial  activities.  One-time  noise  level  measurement \nwas carried out at 10 locations from 29 to 31 May 2007. Noise levels in the project area range \nfrom 37.2 dB(A) to 47.8 dB(A) , as presented in Table A8.4.  \n \n\n5. \n\nWater Quality \n\nBiological Environment \n\n \n14. \nThe quality of water from hand pumps and tubewells, as well as from the Lower Dahar \nWah  Canal,  was  evaluated.    Groundwater  quality  was  found  to  be  unfit  for  drinking  purposes \nbecause  of  the  presence  of  an  excessive  amount  of  total  dissolved  solids  (TDS),  total \nsuspended solids (TSS), calcium and magnesium hardness as calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and \nammonia.  In  case  of  surface  water,  the  amounts  of  BOD5  was  52.8  and  chemical  oxygen \ndemand  was  74  mg/l,  both  of  which  are  on  the  high  side.  The  results  of  the  water  quality \nanalysis  (surface  and  groundwater)  are  presented  in  Tables  A8.5  and  A8.6.  International  and \nnational standards for effluent from the thermal power plants are presented in Tables A8.7 and \nA8.8. \n \nE. \n \n15. \nIn Ghotki District, there are three inland forests, Mirpur Plantation, Sarhad Plantation and \nAdilpur Plantation, which are located 15 to 20 km from the project site. The main plant species \nof  the  plantations  are  shisham  (Dalbergia  sisso),  babul/kikar  (Acacia  nilotica)  and  bahan \n(Populus euphractica). There is one riverine forest, Rounti Forest, about 20 km from the project \nsite.  The  main  plant  species  of  the  forest  are  babul  (Acacia  nilotica),  bahan  (Populus \neuphractica),  lai  (Tamarix  gallica)  and  jhoa  (Tamarix  dioca).    Other  tree  species  of  the  area \ninclude  kandi  (Prosopis  specigera),  karir  (caparis  aphylla),  ber  (Zizyphus  jujuba),  pipal  (Ficus \nreligosa), neem (Azadarachts indica), pilu (Salvadora eleoides), and khabar (Salvadora percica). \nA  number  of  varieties  of  shrubs  and  grasses  are  also  very  common  in  the  area.  The  most \ncommon  shrub  is  ak  (Calotropis  procera)  and  the  most  common  grass  is  kan  (Saccharum \nspontancum). \n \n16. \nThe mammal biodiversity of Ghotki District is limited to jackal and wild boar populations. \nOther  species  rarely  seen  in  the  area  include  various  kinds  of  deer,  particularly  chinkara  and \nfoxes.    Bird  species  include  hawk,  kit,  crow,  parrot,  common  sparrow,  pigeon,  tillur,  quail, \npartridge, and water fowl along the river. \n \n17. \nendangered. No wildlife sanctuary or game reserve is located in the vicinity of the study area.  \n \nF. \n \n18. \nThe surrounding areas are inhabited by agricultural communities. The population of the \nstudy area lives in scattered settlements of Bashirabad and two villages (goths), Mitho Lakhan \nand Sultan/Bachal Lashari. Based on the socioeconomic survey, the estimated population of the \nstudy area is 1,400.  \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  as  four  families  have  been \n19. \ndisplaced  from  the  land  (132  acres)  that  has  been  sold  to  Fauji  Foundation  by  the  previous \nlandowner  through  a  negotiated  settlement.  The  families,  comprising  17  individuals,  had  been \n\nThere  are  several  local  trees,  wild  animals  and  bird  species  in  the  area,  but  none  is \n\nSocioeconomic Environment \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n      Appendix 6 \n\nliving  as  agricultural laborers  on  the  land  in  housing  provided  by  the  previous  landowner.  The \nemployment opportunities of the households will remain unaffected as they will continue to work \nthe  lands  of  the  landowner  and  others.  Agreement  has  been  reached  with  the  elders  of  the \nadjacent  village,  Mitho  Lakhan,  that  families  may  be  relocated  to  that  village.  The  affected \nfamilies were provided with cash assistance to allow them to relocate them and construct proper \nreplacement housing.  \n \n20. \nNo archaeological, historical and religious sites exist in the project area. However, there \nare  some  scattered  mosques,  graveyards  and  shrines.  No  indigenous  group  of  people  was \nidentified. \n \nG. \n \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nImpacts During Construction \n\n \n21. \nBased on supplementary information, 3.8 million cubic feet soil will be required to fill the \nproject site level up to its required elevation (0.2 m above the graded ground elevation). A large \nquantity of available excavated soil from the erection of plant machinery and other allied works \nwill be reused as filling materials. Additional borrow materials will be drawn from the adjoining \npoor quality saline areas.   \n \n22. \nSewage will be generated from construction camps, the contractor\u2019s workshop, and the \nequipment  washing  yard.  Sewer  drains  will  lead  to  an  on-site  disposal  area  for  treatment  or \nholding  in  septic  tanks  with  leach  fields.  The  septic  tanks  and  soak  pits  will  be  located  at  a \nminimum  distance  of  300m  from  water  sources,  and  not  in  an  area  with  a  high  groundwater \ntable. All waste from plant drains subject to oil spills will be collected into an oily water separator \nbefore being drained into the disposal system. The oil waste will be separated and collected in \ndrums and shipped to disposal areas from where they will be hauled away by local contractors.    \n  \n23. \nDust  generated  during  construction  is  expected  to  have  some  adverse  impact  on  air \nquality.  This  problem  will  be  mitigated  by  wetting  the  paths  of  heavy  vehicles  with  water,  and \ncontrolling the speed and limiting the movement of vehicles. All vehicles and machines will have \nroutine  maintenance  to  reduce  engine  emissions.  Vehicles  used  to  transport  construction \nmaterial  will  be  covered  with  tarpaulin.  Impacts  on  local  communities  will  be  limited  as  the \nimmediate area is sparsely populated.  \n \nNoise  will  be  generated  during  construction.  Construction  activities  will  be  planned  so \n24. \nthat  simultaneous  noisy  operations  are  avoided.  Powered  mechanical  equipment  such  as \nbulldozers, air compressors, concrete pumps, excavators, and concrete mixers will only be used \nwith low sound power whenever possible. Silencers or mufflers on construction equipment will \nbe  used.  Protective  devices  will  be  provided  to  workers  to  minimize  the  effects  of  high  noise \nlevels, which will be within with the parameters set out in the World Bank\u2019s Pollution Prevention \nand Abatement Handbook (1998). \n \nConstruction of the plant will require clearing and removal of common vegetation, mainly \n25. \nweeds, bushes and the few trees existing on the project site. Planting of indigenous trees and \nbushes belonging to the natural types at the site will be undertaken.  \n \nThe  general  mobility  and  accessibility  of  the  local  residents  and  their  livestock  in  and \n26. \naround the project area is unlikely to be significantly hindered during construction. A temporary \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                       Appendix 6      \n\n31\n\nfence will be installed around the project area to ensure that project activities remain confined \nwithin project boundaries. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpacts During Operations \n\n \n27. \nAll  process  water  and  sanitary  waste  water  of  the  project  will  be  adequately  treated \nbefore  it  is  discharged  to  the  surface  water.  Wastewater  after  treatment  will  be  stored  in  an \nevaporation  pond,  which  will  be  properly  lined  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  seepage  and  to \nsafeguard  the  quality  of  groundwater.  Relevant  standards  for  final  disposal  of  process \nwastewater  effluent  streams,  including  boiler  blowdown,  cooling  tower  blowdown,  and \ndemineralizer waste, will be strictly observed and monitored. \n  \n28.  Water  leading  from  oil  storage  tanks  and  transformers  will  first  be  collected  at  an  oil \nwater  connection  pit,  treated  at  oily  water  separator,  and  then  disposed  into  the  evaporation \npond. Similarly, storm and rain water will also be collected at the evaporation pond. \n \nThe  air  pollutant  dispersion  calculations  indicate  that,  because  of  plant  operations,  the \n29. \nmaximum  allowable  ground  level  concentrations  for  NOx  should  be  17.2  ug/m3\n  ,  for  SOx  0.2 \nug/m3, and for PM10 6.9 ug/m3. As the project area is currently devoid of industrial pollution, no \nsignificant impacts are envisaged on ambient air quality during operations. Air quality monitoring  \nsystems,  as  well  as  noise  level  monitoring,  will  be  set  up  to  meet  the  Pakistan  National \nEnvironmental  Quality  Standards  (NEQS)  as  prescribed  under  by  the  National  Environmental \nProtection Act (1997). \n \nThe plant equipment will need to comply with the project specification standards to meet \n30. \nambient noise limits. As the noise limits and stack emission standards will not be exceeded, the \nimpact  on  fauna  and  flora  and  adjacent  communities  will  be  low.  Operation  of  the  facility  will \nresult in air and noise emissions that could have an impact on the resting, nesting, and roosting \nactivities of the surrounding flora and fauna. Extensive planting of trees will be carried out inside \nthe  power  plant  area,  along  the  roads  and  paths  along  the entire  boundary  wall  of  the  project \narea, and in available spaces in the project area, which will mitigate any impacts on flora, and \nwill also improve the aesthetic appearance of the area. \n \n31. \nThe  construction  of  the  plant  will  provide  job  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled \nemployment  to  the  locals,  and  lead  to  improvements  in  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the \npeople.  Some  commercial  activities,  such  as  small  eateries,  a  gas  station,  general  stores, \nworkshops,  and  small  warehouses  are  likely  to  develop  at  the  site  during  construction.  These \nactivities will benefit the local population. \n \nH. \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\n1. \n\nOrganizational Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities \n\n \n32. \nFauji  Foundation  will  nominate  a  project  manager  who  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  Project.  The  manager  will  also  supervise  and  monitor \ncompliance with the contractor\u2019s obligations related to design and construction, as well as with \nenvironmental  and  social  requirements.  An  independent  monitoring  consultant  will  act  as  the \nexternal monitoring agency on behalf of Fauji Foundation and will monitor all activities at regular \nintervals. The consultant will report to the manager on compliance issues. \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n      Appendix 6 \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nFauji  Foundation  will  also  establish  a  health,  safety,  and  environmental  management \n33. \nunit  (HSEM  unit)  to  implement  the  HSEM  policy.  To  support  the  unit,  three  staff  (a  shift \nchemist/engineer,  a  plant  operator,  and  a  laboratory/plant  chemist)  will  be  employed.  The  unit \nwill  monitor  the  environmental  performance  of  the  contractor  as  required  by  SEPA.  \nEnvironmental training will be carried out for the contactor and construction supervision staff. \n \n34. \nDuring  project  construction,  the  HSEM  unit  will  monitor  compliance  with  SEPA \nrequirements  regarding air  emissions,  water  quality  (drinking  and  surface  water  quality),  noise \nstandards  and  waste  disposal.  The  effects  on  the  socioeconomic  environment  will  also  be \nmonitored  by  the  HSEM  unit,  considering  parameters  such  as  local  employment,  health  and \nsafety  of  communities  and  mobility  of  local  women.  Table  A8.9  presents  the  environmental \nmonitoring program for the construction and operation phases of the Project. The environment \nmanagement plan is presented in Table A8.10.  \n \n35. \nThe environmental monitoring to be carried out by Independent Monitoring Consultant at \nthe  construction  stage  is  estimated  at  about  PRs.2.0  million.    The  cost  for  internal  monitoring \nand  training  to  be  carried  out  by  Fauji  Foundation  staff  is  estimated  at  PRs.  3.5  million  for \nconstruction as well as for 2 years\u2019 monitoring during the operation stage (PRs. 3.2 million for \nmonitoring and PRs. 0.3 million for training).  \n \nI. \n \n36. \nThe Project has been well known to local communities for some time, particularly given \nthe proximity of the Mari gas field complex. Consultations were held with local leaders and with \nmembers  of  the  community.  The  required  no-objection  certificate  from  the  SEPA  was  granted \non  10  February  2007  and  was  followed  by  public  hearings  in  Karachi  and  Daharki.  The  local \nadministration supports the project and there has been no adverse public reaction. \n \nJ. \n \n37. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  significant  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and \noperations  because  of  the  nature  of  the  Project  and  its  site.  The  Project  will  install  a  low  NOx \nburner to reduce NOx emissions so they are within the permissible levels of the NEQS. \n \nK. \n \nThe  major  conclusions  on  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  are  as  follows.    First,  it \n38. \nwill  have  no  significant  environmental  impacts.  The  NOx  emissions  by  the  gas  turbine \ngenerators can be controlled effectively, and air quality can be maintained within the prescribed \nstandards.  Second,  it  will  draw  on  Fauji  Foundation\u2019s  well-recognized  health,  safety  and \nenvironmental  procedures  to  deal  effectively  with  any  accidents  or  disasters  during  project \nconstruction  and  operation.  Third,  the  Project  can  deal  effectively  with  any  potential \nenvironmental impacts, which are well understood and can be mitigated.   \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nConclusion \n\n

The  feasibility  study  by  the  Project\u2019s  technical \nconsultants,  Fichtner  GmbH  was  completed  in  July  2005.  An  engineering,  procurement  and \nconstruction  contract  for  the  main  aspects  of  the  project  was  signed  in  February  2007.  The \nproject  is  expected  to  reach  financial  close  by  August  2007,  and  is  expected  to  commence \ncommercial operations by September 2009.  \n\n2. \nFauji  Foundation,  the  Sponsor,  was  established  as  a  charitable  trust  in  1954,  and \noperates  on  a  completely  self  sustaining  basis,  channeling  approximately  80%  of  the  profits \nfrom commercial ventures into welfare programs that serve a beneficiary population consisting \nof  ex-servicemen  and  their  eligible  dependents.  Fauji  Foundation  has  prior  experience  of \nowning, managing and operating a low-BTU gas-fired power plant in Pakistan. It is the largest \nowner of Fauji Kabirwala, established in 1997 with El Paso Energy International and ADB, which \nprovided a loan to the project. In addition to Fauji Kabirwala, Fauji Foundation has also been a \npartner/borrower in other ADB projects, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited and Fauji Oil Terminal \nCompany Limited. \n \n\nThe  Daharki  plant  will  have  one  gas  turbine  of  121.5MW,  one  heat  recovery  steam \n3. \ngenerator, and one steam turbine of 62.8MW. A 15 km gas transmission pipeline will supply gas \nto  the  Project  complex,  and  power  from  the  Project  will  be  evacuated  to  NTDC\u2019s  220Kv \nDaharki\u2013Rohri  transmission  line.  A  residential  colony  for  staff  will  be  constructed  on  the \nProject\u2019s premises.  \n \nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Information and Consultations \n\nGhotki  district  in  Sindh  Province  ranks  among  the  lowest  on  social  indicators,  with  the \n4. \nliteracy rate at only 29%. The literacy rate is heavily skewed between genders, with 44.2% and \n11.85% of male and female population being literate, respectively. While predominantly Moslem, \nas  expected,  there  are  a  few  Hindu  families  (Minghora).  The  population  comprises  Solongi, \nMaricha, Bhatti, Shaikh and Soomro households. Being a northern district of Sindh, Ghotki has \naccess  to  water  resources.  The  sub-canal  Mahi  Wah,  a  distributary  of  the  Guddu  Barrage, \nirrigates  the  area,  but  land  is  affected  by  waterlogging,  hence  there  are  high  levels  of  salinity \nacross lands that vary considerably in productive potential.  There are natural resources, such \nas  oil  and  gas,  and  extractive  industries.  Crops  include  maize,  sugarcane,  cotton,  rice,  and \nthere are several mango orchards. Not many local people have many employment opportunities \nin  the  industries.  The  crime  rate  is  very  high  and  people,  especially  the  poor,  live  under  the \nstress of a poor law and order situation (with proximity to the Indus, there are many dacoits1 in \nthe area).  \n\n5. \nThe Project is located along Dad Lagari road, about 8.5 km south of the city of Daharki. \nDistrict Ghotki, Sindh Province. The project area is adjacent to Village (Goth) Mitho Lakhan, and \ncomprises 132 acres of saline, low productivity lands acquired from a single landowner.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Traditional bandit families.  \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n     \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  Category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n6. \n(1995) as four families will be displaced from the southeast corner of land (132 acres) that has \nbeen sold to Fauji Foundation by the previous landowner through a negotiated settlement. The \nfamilies,  comprising  17  individuals,  have  been  living  as  agricultural  laborers  on  the  land  in \nhousing  (two  houses,  with  rudimentary  mud-brick  walls  and  GI  sheet-roofs)  provided  by  the \nlandowner.  \n\n7. \nThe principal members of the four families who were consulted during the preparation of \nthe  EIA,  and  most  recently  in  May  2007,  include  Weryam,  Haji  Gohram,  Riaz  Ahmad, \nMuhammad  Hassan,  Muhammad  Anwar,  Lal  Buksh,  Lutuf  Ali,  Abdul  Wahid,  and  Abdul  Latif. \nDuring those consultations, they acknowledged that the project was beneficial to the community, \nbut  asked  that  their  labor  opportunities  be  protected,  and  compensation  be  paid  as  they  had \nvery few assets \u2013 particularly as their housing had been provided by the landowner.  \n\nThe  Project  site  does  not  affect  any  indigenous  peoples.  Consequently,  the  Project  is \n\n8. \nclassified as Category C under the Indigenous Peoples policies. \n \nC. \n\nPolicy Framework, Entitlements, and Income Restoration \n\n9. \nThe legislation relating to land acquisition and compensation is the Land Acquisition Act \n(LAA) of 1894 (as amended). Following a national consultative process, a national resettlement \npolicy  and  related  ordnance  had  been  drafted,  both  of  which  are  being  reviewed  by  the \nprovincial  governments.  Currently,  the  Pakistan  Environment  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  is \nresponsible  of  both  environment  and  resettlement-related  matters.  The  responsibilities  for \nimplementation of resettlement-related matters are delegated to the provincial EPAs; however, \nformal land acquisition is carried out by the provincial Boards of Revenue and the District Land \nAcquisition  Collectors.  The  categories  of  loss  covered  by  the  current  regulations  include  land, \nphysical  properties,  crops,  trees,  as  well  as  income,  and  access  to  livelihood  opportunities. \nVulnerable groups are given special consideration, including women, children, destitute persons, \ntribal  communities,  squatters,  persons  with  usufruct  rights,  and  landless.  Emphasis  is  also \nplaced on consultation with affected persons. \n\nAlthough  the  laborers  will  continue  to  work  the  new  lands  of  the  previous  landowner  \u2013 \n10. \nand  there  are  many  similar  opportunities  for  labor  on  other  lands  in  the  immediate  area  \u2013 \nagreement  has  been  reached  with  the  elders  of  the  nearby  village,  Mitho  Lakhan,  that  the \ndisplaced families can be relocated to that village with residence rights. Although the LAA does \nnot  apply  to  the  negotiated  settlement  between  Fauji  Foundation  and  the  landowner  of  the \nproject  site,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  requires  that  appropriate  compensation  be \nprovided to persons displaced by a project. Recognizing that the families have no assets, Fauji \nFoundation  has  agreed  to  provide  assistance  to  the  families  displaced  by  the  willing  buyer-\nwilling  seller  based  purchase  of  the  land  required  for  the  Project.  The  assistance  has  been \ndisbursed  and  is  well  over  the  cost  of  relocation  to  the  nearby  village  and  the  construction  of \naccommodation similar to their existing housing.  \n \nD. \n\nGrievances and Monitoring Mechanism \n\n11. \nAlthough there is no basis for formal legal proceedings regarding land acquisition in the \ncase of the Project, those affected will have recourse to hearing of any complaints through the \ntribal  leaders  and  councils  (sardars,  jirgas),  and  government  officials  (Nazim).  As  part  of  its \ncommunity  outreach  activities,  Fauji  Foundation  will  ascertain  that  the  welfare  of  the  families \n\n \n\n\fwho  have  had  to  relocate  has  not  been  adversely  affected  by  the  move,  and  will  report  such \nfindings to ADB. \n \n\nAppendix 7  \n\n49\n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 3 October 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\nPRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n$ 0.0164 \nPRs60.74 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS  \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ADB \nBOO \nCCPP \nCOD \nDSCR \nECA \nEIA \nEIRR \nEPC \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nbuild-own-operate \ncombined cycle power plant \ncommercial operations date \ndebt service coverage ratio \nexport credit agency \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return  \nengineering, procurement, and \nconstruction \nFauji Kabirwala Power Company Limited \nFoundation Power Company Daharki \nLimited  \nindependent power producer \ninternal rate of return \nKarachi Electric Supply Corporation \nLimited \nPakistan\u2019s Medium Term Development \nFramework (2005\u20132010) \nNational Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority  \nNational Transmission and Dispatch \nCorporation \npower purchase agreement \nPrivate Power and Infrastructure Board \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Water and Power Development Authority \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "FKPCL \n", "FPCDL \nIPP \nIRR \n", "KESC \n", "MTDF \n", "NEPRA \n", "NTDC \nPPA \nPPIB \nWAPDA\n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n", "BTU (British thermal unit) \nCF (cubic feet) \nMMCF (million cubic feet) \nMMCFD (million cubic feet \nof gas per day) \nkm \nkm2 \nkV (kilovolt) \nkWh (kilowatt-hour) \nMW (megawatt) \nGWh (gigawatt-hour) \n", "unit of thermal measure \nunit of cubic measure \n1,000,000 CF \n1,000,000 CF per day \n", "kilometer \nsquare kilometer \n1,000 volts \n1,000 watt-hours \n1 million watts \n1 million kilowatt-hours \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "NOTES \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "L.
