I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nequity investment of up to $30,000,000 equivalent in Indian rupees, and (ii) a proposed senior \ndebt financing of up to $20,000,000 equivalent in Indian rupees to Annapurna Finance Private \nLimited for the Supporting Access to Finance for Women in Rural Areas Project in India. \n \n2.  Annapurna will use the proceeds of the debt financing of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to finance (i) microfinance loans to women customers under the self-help group (SHG) and \njoint liability group (JLG) models,1 (ii) other small loans to individuals and micro and small \nenterprises (MSEs), and (iii) affordable housing loans. All of ADB\u2019s debt proceeds will be onlent \nto sub-borrowers in semi-urban and rural areas2 in lagging states.3 ADB\u2019s equity investment will \nprovide growth capital to underpin expansion of Annapurna\u2019s total loan portfolio in India. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Access to credit in India is limited, with less than 15.7% of borrowers accessing credit \nthrough formal channels.4 In terms of rural outreach, only 16.5% of borrowers in rural areas \naccessed credit from a financial institution.5 Given the continued need to address access to credit \nissues, particularly for women, and to support the government\u2019s finance sector reform efforts, \nADB has sought to identify financial institution partners that have demonstrated the ability to reach \nunderbanked  segments  on  a  profitable  and  sustainable  basis.  Annapurna,  a  microfinance \ninstitution (MFI) based in the state of Odisha, has a solid credit methodology coupled with a strong \nsocial focus, including provision of training on financial literacy and women\u2019s empowerment, as \nwell as education programs centered on topics such as health and hygiene. This has enabled it \nto maintain high-quality asset growth while achieving measurable social returns.6 \n \n4.  The proposed transaction seeks to support Annapurna as it grows its presence in eastern \nand central India and diversifies across underpenetrated regions of India, with a particular focus \non lagging states and rural areas. This strategy will further Annapurna\u2019s vision of offering equal \n                                                \n1  SHGs are associations of up to 20 members, mostly women, from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Loans are \ngiven to members of the SHG after an agreement is reached between all members of the group. Each SHG is a \nseparate legal entity and also compulsorily starts a group savings practice, thus ensuring its integrity and longevity. \nThe other common microfinance model, based on JLGs, involves groups of typically 4\u201310 women that are formed \nwith the assistance of microfinance institutions (MFIs) to avail themselves of loans without providing any collateral. \nJLGs do not constitute a legal entity and each member of the group is jointly and severally liable for the repayment \nof loans taken by all of group members. \n2  Rural and semi-urban areas are as defined under the Master Circular on Branch Authorisation dated 1 July 2014 \nand issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), or as may be otherwise specified by the RBI from time to time. \n3  100% of the ADB debt proceeds will be onlent in those lagging states as agreed between ADB and Annapurna from \ntime to time. Lagging states include low-income states with high poverty incidence, and special category states as \nagreed between the Government of India and ADB. These include Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, \nJharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar \nPradesh, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal. \n4  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  World Bank. Global Findex Database. http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/ (accessed 24 August 2018). \nData is as of 2017. \n6  Annapurna has Client Protection Certification from the Smart Campaign and achieved an A social rating from \nMicroFinanza Rating based on its good social performance management and client protection systems. The Smart \nCampaign and MicroFinanza Rating are well-recognized organizations that focus specifically on the microfinance \nindustry. \n \n ", "2 \nopportunities, particularly for its low-income women customers, through universal access and \nfinancial deepening, which will help promote financial inclusion, and livelihood and economic \ndevelopment. Annapurna has continuously sought partnerships with like-minded institutions while \ncharting  its  own  growth.  The  proposed  ADB  equity  investment  and  debt  funding  will  be \nAnnapurna\u2019s first partnership with a multilateral financial institution.7 \n \n5.  Annapurna  has  been  part  of  ADB\u2019s  Microfinance  Risk  Participation  and  Guarantee \nProgram since 2014.8 Excluding the institutions that have been awarded a small finance bank \n(SFB) license, Annapurna is the eighth largest MFI in the country. Annapurna is viewed as a \nstrong partner for ADB in the Indian microfinance sector, as over 89% of its portfolio is in lagging \nstates and about 85% is in rural areas; the industry average is 58% in lagging states and 66% in \nrural areas.9 It has a significant presence in some of the largest underpenetrated and lagging \nstates such as Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh. \nTherefore, there is direct alignment between Annapurna\u2019s women-inclusive finance focus and \nADB\u2019s inclusive finance and gender development objectives. The proposed project is also viewed \nas complementary to other ADB initiatives in the finance sector to support the Indian microfinance \nsector\u2014including the loan to IndusInd Bank for the Supporting Access to Finance for Women in \nLess-Developed States Project disbursed in September 2017, and the equity investment in April \n2017 in Satin Creditcare Network Limited for the Supporting Access to Finance for Women in \nLagging States Project\u2014as well ADB\u2019s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program.10 \n \n6.  Therefore, Annapurna has been identified as a strong candidate for ADB funding because \nof (i) the substantial development impact associated with the provision of financial inclusion to its \ncustomer base, predominantly women in rural areas of India\u2019s lagging states; (ii) its demonstrated \nsound financial performance and risk management processes; (iii) it being the only large MFI in \nIndia  that  has  primarily  adopted  the  SHG  model  of  microfinance,  which  provides  high \ndevelopment impact through promotion of savings and group cohesion, in addition to loan \nproducts; and (iv) the greater portfolio diversification the project would provide, as ADB currently \ndoes not have any direct financing exposure to MFIs predominantly operating in eastern India. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  Gender and microfinance. Women are one of the most vulnerable groups in the world\u2019s \npoorest populations and a significant number of them remain unbanked. In India, only 17% of \nwomen (compared with 22% of men) have savings at a financial institution, and only 5% of women \n(compared with 8% of men) have borrowed from a financial institution.11 Businesses owned by \n                                                \n7  In the case of small finance banks (SFBs), foreign ownership is restricted to 49%. In September 2015, the RBI \nawarded licenses to 10 institutions to convert into SFBs. SFBs function like a standard bank, with the ability to take \ndeposits, but also have to focus on smaller loans and have higher priority sector lending requirements than other \nbanks. \n8  ADB. 2010.

Challenges that often limit access to \nfinance include lack of a land title, lack of collateral needed to obtain credit, low income, absence \nof financial documents, and unfamiliarity with paperwork and procedures. Nonbank microfinance \nmodels have provided an alternative channel for provision of financial services to women because \nthey address the constraints of traditional banking models, for example, by having limited or no \ncollateral requirements. Well-designed microfinance products provide an opportunity for women \nto enter the formal finance sector, build microfinance credit histories, and increase economic \nactivities.12 Annapurna addresses these constraints through SHG lending, with over 99% of the \ncumulative amount of microloans disbursed being provided to women borrowers for services and \nactivities directly benefiting women. Under this lending model, Annapurna has successfully built \na sustainable microfinance operation, specifically targeting women in rural areas where there is \nless competition and microfinance penetration is lowest. \n \n8.  Overview and strategy. Annapurna has the majority of its operations in eastern and \ncentral India. At the end of June 2018, it operated in 14 states through 451 branches, spread \nacross 199 districts and servicing more than 1.26 million customers. Annapurna was initially part \nof  People\u2019s  Forum,  a  nonprofit  organization  conducting  developmental  activities  that  was \nestablished in 1989. People\u2019s Forum commenced an independent microfinance project in 2007 \nunder the name of Mission Annapurna. The microfinance operation was placed in a separate \nentity and registered as a nonbank financial company (NBFC)-MFI with the Reserve Bank of India \n(RBI) in 2013.  \n \n9.  Currently, Annapurna primarily provides microloans to women under the SHG model (90% \nof its total microfinance portfolio), but also provides a small number of microloans in certain areas \nusing the JLG model. Annapurna is the only large NBFC-MFI that has primarily adopted the SHG \nmodel. Microfinance loans account for over 97% of its total lending operations. The average size \nof its microloans is  \u20b928,000.13 Other than microfinance loans,  since fiscal year (FY) 2016 \nAnnapurna has also offered specialized loan products for water and sanitation, loans for people \nwith disabilities, education loans, solar loans, dairy loans of up to \u20b9150,000, and larger individual \nloans of up to \u20b9100,000 to members of marginalized groups for livelihood generation. During \nFY2018, the company started affordable housing finance (for incremental housing and home \npurchases) and MSE lending, following pilot testing of these product lines over an 18-month \nperiod. \n \n10.  Annapurna operates primarily in districts where penetration of microfinance is relatively \nlow. The states in which Annapurna has its largest operations are Odisha (representing 46% of \nits total loan portfolio), Madhya Pradesh (15%), Maharashtra (10%), Chhattisgarh (9%), Assam \n(7%), and Bihar (6%). Annapurna is one of the market leaders in several states in which it \noperates; it has the second largest microfinance loan portfolio in Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Since \n2016, it has expanded into nine new states, including two (Haryana and West Bengal) in 2018. \nAnnapurna is growing faster in these recently entered areas as compared with its traditional \nmarket of Odisha as it seeks to diversify its portfolio geographically.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  Ownership. The largest shareholder is Oman India Joint Investment Fund II (OIJIF), a \ngrowth capital private equity fund focused on investing in the mid-market segment in India.14 OIJIF \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013.

The Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries, \na bilateral development bank, invested in Annapurna in 2014 and holds about 14%.  \n \n12.  Management. Annapurna\u2019s senior management is led by the promoter, Gobinda Chandra \nPattanaik, a microfinance industry veteran and a social entrepreneur, who holds about 9% of the \ncompany. He is known to be a pioneer in the field of women\u2019s empowerment in Odisha, having \nset up various microenterprise activities in the state. He has played a key role in establishing \nvarious other community-based institutions and is an advisor to various district administrations. \nThe company also has another promoter director, Dibyajoti Pattanaik, who has more than 12 \nyears of experience in the microfinance sector and who played a critical role in launching and \nbuilding the company. \n \n13.  Governance structure. Annapurna\u2019s board currently comprises 11 directors, including \nthe two individual promoters, three independent directors, and six directors nominated by the \ninvestors.  The  three  independent  directors  have  several  decades  of  experience  across \ninvestment  banking,  development  banking,  and  microfinance.  All  six  nominee  directors \nrepresenting the private investors are members of the senior management teams within their \nrespective  companies  and  have  strong  professional  and  educational  backgrounds.  The \ncomposition of the board complies with all regulatory requirements as prescribed by the RBI. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n14.  The proposed ADB assistance consists of (i) an equity investment of up to $30 million \nequivalent in Indian rupees, with an initial investment of up to $22 million equivalent in Indian \nrupees; and (ii) senior debt financing of up to 5 years for up to $20 million equivalent in Indian \nrupees, with an initial disbursement of up to $10 million equivalent in Indian rupees. The balance \nof the approved equity amount may be invested in subsequent fundraising rounds that Annapurna \nis expected to undertake before its initial public offering (IPO). ADB will obtain the right to \nnominate  a  member  to  Annapurna\u2019s  board  of  directors.  Under  separate  approval,  ADB  is \nexpected to provide capacity building technical assistance in an amount of up to $500,000, which \nwill accompany the ADB funding and is expected to support the company in key areas such as \ngender mainstreaming, including in the areas of skills development of Annapurna\u2019s customers \nand risk management.15 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  monitor  the  project.  Annapurna  will  provide  ADB  with  financial  reports  at \npredetermined regular intervals and as requested, including (i) unaudited financial statements on \na  quarterly  basis,  (ii)  audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis,  (iii)  reports  on \ncharacteristics of the total loan portfolio and subloans funded with the proceeds of ADB\u2019s debt \nfacilities, (iv) annual reports on selected development indicators agreed between ADB and \nAnnapurna, and (v) annual reports on safeguards and social protection compliance. Exit options \nfor ADB\u2019s equity investment will include the sale of shares in the open market if the company does \nan IPO or the sale of ADB\u2019s shareholding to an institutional investor. \n                                                \n15 The technical assistance will be approved separately and is expected to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n ", "5 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n16.  Finance sector development and financial inclusion as a strategic partner. The \nproposed equity investment and debt financing seek to support a private financial institution\u2019s \ngrowth as it expands its lending presence into unserved and underserved geographical regions \nof India. ADB will provide stable sources of longer-term funding as Annapurna undertakes its \nportfolio expansion. The ADB funding will enable Annapurna to provide products and expand \nservices to address the financial needs of India\u2019s poor, which are not being met by mainstream \nfinancial institutions, and will thereby complement the government\u2019s objective to increase financial \ninclusion. ADB will be Annapurna\u2019s first multilateral institutional partner. Without ADB\u2019s funding, \nAnnapurna\u2019s growth would be constrained by limited long-term funding and insufficient capital. \n \n17.  Annapurna\u2019s stakeholders also believe that it is necessary to fill the gap in the existing \nshareholder structure by bringing in a like-minded development partner with experience and \nknowledge in some of its core business areas, such as MSE finance, rural finance, and affordable \nhousing  finance.  Through  ADB\u2019s  nominee  on  Annapurna\u2019s  board  of  directors  and  broader \nshareholder engagement, Annapurna will benefit from ADB\u2019s experience with other financial \ninstitutions in the region. \n \n18.  Strengthening capital and providing longer tenor debt. Annapurna will need capital \nand long-term debt financing as it continues to expand its loan portfolio in response to significant \ndemand for credit from underserved segments and the growing needs of the Indian economy. \nWithout additional capital, the company could not grow as planned and be in compliance with \nexisting prudential capital adequacy requirements. As Annapurna expands its newest product \nsegments of MSE and affordable housing lending, it will need to source additional long term debt \nso tenor mismatches do not arise. Capital markets are still developing in India and other long-\nterm sources of debt are difficult for MFIs to source. The promoters have also identified significant \nbenefits from raising capital from an institution such as ADB, as this will signal confidence in \nAnnapurna. This is important as Annapurna emerges from the demonetization situation, with \nstakeholders and market participants still being sensitive to uncertainty and potential risks. \n \n19.  Adherence to market-leading standards. As the first multilateral development institution \nshareholder, ADB will help to develop and support Annapurna\u2019s (i) adherence to high corporate \ngovernance and risk management standards; and (ii) adoption of international best practices, \nprimarily in respect of risk management, social, and environmental standards. ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance is also expected to enhance the company\u2019s risk management framework and further \nstrengthen its gender initiatives, which will be implemented through a gender action plan (GAP). \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n20.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: access to finance and credit for \nwomen, primarily in rural areas of lagging states, increased. This is in alignment with the \nGovernment of India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda, which highlights the delivery of affordable \n ", "6 \nbanking and other financial services to unserved or underserved groups as a means to promote \npoverty reduction and inclusive growth.16 \n \n21.  Outcomes. The project will have the following outcomes: (i) uptake of financial services \nin target groups increased, particularly among women, and primarily in rural areas of lagging \nstates; and (ii) lending activities by Annapurna to the MSE and affordable housing segment \nexpanded. \n \n22.  Outputs.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  Annapurna\u2019s  capacity  to \nsustainably provide loans and other financial services to underserved target groups, including \nwomen, increased; and (ii) Annapurna\u2019s expansion into new product segments such as MSEs \nand affordable housing loans carried out. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n23.  The project supports the following key operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) promoting rural development, (iii) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity through ADB\u2019s environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) and its role on the company\u2019s board, and (iv) accelerating progress \nin gender equality through the GAP.17 The proposed equity investment and debt financing \ncontribute to finance sector development by supporting the growth of an MFI, with microfinance \nbeing an important component of the finance sector in India. Without access to formal financial \nservices, lower-income people or underserved segments will be excluded from the growth \nprocess and its benefits. According to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, \nADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue to support the finance sector by undertaking projects \nin support of the country\u2019s financial infrastructure.18 The project will support the development of \nmicrofinance in India, one of the financial segments identified as a high priority for the government. \nIt will also support lending growth in lagging states, another priority area of the government. The \nproject is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, \n2013\u20132020.19 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n24.  The project is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment, and FI treated as \nC for impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. ADB has assessed the \ninvestment's potential environment and social impacts, its risks associated with Annapurna\u2019s \nexisting and likely future portfolio, and its commitment and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement. Annapurna\u2019s existing and future lending exposure primarily comprises low- to \nmedium-risk sectors. The nature and scale of Annapurna\u2019s current transactions with a maximum \nloan size of about $40,000 are expected to have no to minimal adverse environmental impacts \n                                                \n16 Based on the Government of India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda, which includes such initiatives as the Pradhan Mantri \nJan Dhan Yojana (Prime Minister\u2019s People Money Scheme), priority sector lending requirements, and the Digital \nIndia scheme.  \n17 ADB. 2018.

However, \nthe future portfolio may include businesses or activities that could have potential limited adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Annapurna will not use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s financing for subloans or \nactivities that may be classified as category A for environment and category A or B for involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. Annapurna will (i) align its existing exclusion list with ADB\u2019s \nprohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and abide by applicable national laws and regulations, \nand (iii) update its existing ESMS to be satisfactory to ADB before disbursement of debt or its \nequity subscription.20 The updated ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance \nwith national labor laws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. The updated ESMS will also contain \nrequirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected people in \naccordance with ADB requirements. \n \n25.  Gender  equity  and  poverty  orientation.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment, Annapurna has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment in its lending operations.21 A GAP has been prepared to support the gender equity \ntheme classification of the project. Key features of the GAP are (i) increased access of women to \nexisting financial products, (ii) effective implementation of Annapurna\u2019s gender policy to improve \norganizational  capacity  to  service  women  borrowers,  (iii)  skills  development  and  improved \ncapacity of women borrowers, and (iv) increased access of women to MSE and affordable \nhousing finance. The project has been designed to include gender-specific loan targets that will \nincrease the amount of loans disbursed to women borrowers. Annapurna will submit periodic \nreports on implementation of gender measures to ADB.22 ADB\u2019s participation in the project will \nhelp borrowers, predominantly from the base of the income pyramid, to access financial services \nsuch as microloans and affordable housing loans, which will contribute to the improvement of their \nliving conditions.
