It  also  carries  more  than  half  the  imports  and  exports  from  neighboring  countries, \nand is essential for the growing tourism industry. The economy of the Kyrgyz Republic depends \nheavily  on  road  links  to  neighboring  countries  and  through  them  to  the  major  aviation  and \nmarine  gateways,  particularly  in  South  Asia.  Parts  of  these  links  are  also  vital  for  connecting \ndifferent  parts  of  the  country  and  thereby  reducing  provincial  disparities.  The  government\u2019s \ncurrent  goal  is  to  upgrade  all  international  and  strategic  roads  to  a  uniform  standard,  but  the \nemphasis will switch to local roads in the future.1   \n \nRoad development, which began in the mid-1990s, has accelerated in recent years, and \n3. \nthe government is now paying more attention to road pavement preservation and sustainability. \nBy  2009,  it  had  increased  routine  road  maintenance  and  small  works  expenditure  to  Som1.6 \nbillion (approximately $40 million)\u2014about seven times the expenditure in 2005. Multilateral and \nbilateral development partners have financed the bulk of road rehabilitation and reconstruction \nworks.  The  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement  Project,2 approved  by  the  Board  of \nDirectors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 24 October 20073 (the approved project), is \none  in  a  series  of  projects  financed  by  ADB  in  support  of  the  government's  efforts  to  make \nroads safe, efficient, and available year-round.  \n \n4. \nThe approved project's main component is the improvement of the road from Sary Tash \nto  Karamik  (at  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013Tajikistan  border).  This  road  is  part  of  the  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation4 (CAREC) corridors 3 and 5, which extend from Afghanistan to \nthe Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China (PRC) respectively. Improvements \nto  some  sections  of  corridors  3  and  5,  particularly  the  road  between  Karamik  and  Dushanbe, \nare  also  financed  by  ADB.  Under  the  approved  project,  the  customs  facilities  at  the  Karamik \nborder post will be improved and the government's road maintenance unit and its practices will \nbe reformed. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n5. \nThe principal objectives of the approved project are to reduce transport costs and foster \nregional cooperation among the Kyrgyz Republic, the PRC, Tajikistan, and other Central Asian \n\n                                                 \n1  AKIpress.  2010.  750  km  of  Roads  Rehabilitated  in  Kyrgyzstan  in  2009.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan,  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants, and Technical Assistance Grants to Kyrgyz Republic and Republic of Tajikistan for the \nCAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 2359, Grants 0084 and 0085, and TA 6415). \n\n3  The grant agreement was signed on 31 October 2007 and made effective on 6 February 2008. \n4  The  CAREC  program  is  a  partnership  of  eight  countries  and  six  multilateral  institutions  working  to  promote \n\ndevelopment through cooperation, leading to accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction. \n\n\f2 \n\n8. \n \n\ncountries. The road will improve access to regional markets and social services for people living \nalong the corridor. \n \n6. \nThe  approved  project  will  have  two  physical  and  two  nonphysical  outputs.  The  main \nphysical output is an improved 142-kilometer (km) road connecting Karamik and Sary Tash (km \n350\u2013km 492). The improvements will include rehabilitating an existing 30 km asphalt concrete \nsurfaced section (km 462\u2013km 492) and reconstruction of the remaining existing gravel- surfaced \nroad, river protection works, improvement of drainage systems, and road safety measures. The \napproved  project  will  also  replace  deteriorated  bridges,  repair  12  bridges,  and  build  four  new \nbridges.  All  the  civil  works  have  been  designed  to  comply  with  national  highway  design \nstandards.  The  other  output  is  a  new  passenger  and  vehicle  inspection  area  with  modern \nbuildings, equipment, and traffic channels at the border post in Karamik.5 \n \n7. \nThe  nonphysical  outputs  are:  (i)  a  tri-nation  cross-border  agreement  among  the  PRC, \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan,  to  allow  easy  movement  of  people  and  goods  across \nborders;6 and  (ii)  better  road  maintenance  by  procuring  works  from  the  private  sector  under \nperformance-based contracts. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe approved project is estimated to cost $39.5 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\nPerformance-based maintenance \n\nItem \nA.

The  government  provided  counterpart  financing  of  $13.9  million  to  cover  (i)  taxes \nand  duties  related  to  all  civil  works  and  consulting  services,  (ii)  border  infrastructure \nimprovement  works,  and  (iii)  performance-based  maintenance  contracts.

The civil works, which commenced \noperations  on  1  December  2008,  were  50%  completed  at  the  end  of  March  2010  (compared \nwith the anticipated 33%), and the supervision consultant has certified that the completed work \nmeets  all  standards  and  specifications.7 Disbursements  amounted  to  about  40%  of  the  civil \nworks allocation, and 51% of total financing. \n \n11. \nHowever,  the  road  maintenance  component  has  progressed  more  slowly  than  the  civil \nworks. The intent of this component is twofold: (i) to help restructure the road maintenance unit \nof  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC),  and  (ii)  to  improve  maintenance \neffectiveness  by  outsourcing  the  works  by  2013.  The  government  has  demonstrated  its \ncommitment to this end by increasing maintenance funding.8 \n  \n12. \nProgress  with  the  cross-border  agreement  and  the  customs  facility  improvement \ncomponent has also been slow. The government is committed to taking the action required to \ncomplete  the  cross-border  agreement.  However,  its  completion  and  implementation  before  \n31 December 2010, as required under the financial covenants, will depend on Tajikistan and the \nPRC  signing  the  agreement.  The  government  will  also  ensure  that  the  customs  facility \nimprovements  are  expedited  and  completed  on  time.  The  designs  of  the  border  infrastructure \nhave been completed and the government is expected to procure the works at the end of 2010. \nThe  road  works  contractor  is  scheduled  to  complete  paving  the  inspection  area  and  traffic \nchannels in 2011.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n\nA. \n\nProposed Changes \n\n13. \nThe  government  has  requested  financing  for  modifications  to  the  road  improvement \ncomponent of the approved project, i.e., paving the entire length of 136 km (instead of only 30 \nkm)  with  two  layers  (4  centimeters  [cm]  and  6  cm  respectively)  of  asphalt  concrete.  The  two \nlayers  will  be  designed  to  standards  and  specifications  required  to  achieve  an  international \nroughness  index  not  exceeding  3.5  and  a  service  life  of  20  years  on  the  entire  road.  The \nthe  project \nconsulting  services  provided  by \n                                                 \n7  The  distance  between  Sary  Tash  and  Karamik  was  reduced  from  142  km  to  136  km  through  alignment \nimprovements and bridging to avoid built-up areas. These changes have been done in compliance with social and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  without  any  negative  effects  on  the  project's  outcome  and  impact.  The  change  was \nagreed between ADB and MOTC at the procurement stage and bids were called on 20 March 2008 for civil works \non 136 km. \n\nthe  construction  supervision \n\nteam  and \n\n8  Annual spending on road maintenance has increased by 3%\u20135% since 2005 and vehicle weight controls are being \n\nimplemented. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nimplementation team will be extended to ensure project delivery according to the specifications, \non time, and on budget. \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n14. \nThe proposed changes will increase the approved project's overall impact because it will \nreduce transport costs further. The current travel time of 13 hours between Dushanbe and the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border at Irkeshtam will be more than halved. The changes will require \ncivil works and consulting services to continue for about 18 months beyond the current contract \nend date of 21 May 2011 (i.e., until  1 November 2012). The milestones of some other activities, \noutcomes, and outputs will be postponed because of their start-up delays\u2014not because of the \nproposed  changes.  However,  the  project  completion  date  of  31  March  2013  will  remain \nunchanged. The revised project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\nAlthough  the  feasibility  study9 for  the  approved  project  concluded  that  a  5  cm  layer  of \n15. \nasphalt  concrete  would  be  needed  on  the  entire  road  to  support  the  estimated  future  traffic,10 \nADB financing for the road sector in the approved project was only sufficient to pave 30 km of \nthe  136  km  road.  However,  the  road  network  in  southeast  Kyrgyz  Republic11 and  Tajikistan  is \ncurrently  being  improved  with  ADB  assistance  with  10\u201311  cm,  two-layer  asphalt  concrete \nsurfacing. ADB recently provided supplementary financing12 to Tajikistan to pave road sections \nbetween Karamik and Nimich, which were originally designed to have gravel surfacing.   \n \nCurrent  traffic  volumes  in  other  major  road  links  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  that  were \n16. \nimproved between 2004 and 2009 are more than twice the forecasts. Heavy vehicles constitute \na larger portion of the traffic than anticipated. The likelihood of similar increases in traffic volume \nand composition on the Sary Tash\u2013Karamik road is high. This and the findings of the feasibility \nstudy  fully  support  the  government's  proposal  to  pave  the  entire  road.  The  long-term \nserviceability and life-cycle cost advantages further support the government\u2019s proposal to use a \n10 cm two-layer asphalt concrete surfacing instead of a single 5 cm layer surfacing.   \n \nThe  government  has  confirmed,  and  the  project  team  has  determined,  that  the  project \n17. \ncontinues  to  be  a  priority  in  its  development  strategy.  The  transport  sector  is  performing  well \nand the percentage of primary network roads in good condition and the level of network usage \nhave  improved  since  2005.  Reforms,  in  line  with  the  financial  covenants  of  the  approved \nproject,  have  also  contributed  to  these  improvements.  Overall,  the  proposed  supplementary \nfinancing  complies  with  the  eligibility  criteria  set  out  in  ADB's  Policy  on  Supplementary \nFinancing.13 It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2009\u20132011,14 the \n\n                                                 \n9  BCEOM. 2007.

The  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  be  the  first  provision  of \nsupplementary financing to the approved project, and is less than the total ADB financing for the \nproject  to  date.  With  the  proposed  changes,  the  approved  project  will  remain  technically \nfeasible, economically viable, and financially sustainable.   \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n18. \nThere  will  be  no  land  acquisition,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  impacts  on  the \nenvironment  and  indigenous  peoples  as  a  result  of  the  change.  The  project  will  remain \nclassified as environmental category B. Much of the additional work will be in sections through \nbarren  areas.  A  sound  environmental  management  plan,  which  adequately  covers  the \nadditional work, is currently in place and MOTC reports the environmental quality every month \nto  ADB.  No  adverse  impacts  have  been  reported  to  date,  and  none  are  expected  due  to  the \nproposed  changes.

MOTC,  the  executing  agency  for  the  approved  project,  and  the  project  implementation \nunit (which was renamed the investment project implementation group in June 2010) will remain \nunchanged  and  will  continue  to  manage  the  project.  The  renaming  has  not  changed  its \nstructure,  responsibilities,  staff,  or  the  lines  of  communication  with  MOTC.  All  donor-financed \nprojects are now under one group with a director in charge of overall operations and a deputy \ndirector  serving  as  the  focal  person  for  ADB  projects.  The  activities  financed  from  the \nsupplementary loan will be implemented over 18 months.  \n \n22. \nAccording  to  the  first procurement  plan  of  the approved  project,  civil  works  were  to  be \nprocured as three packages using ADB's international competitive bidding procedure. However, \nearly in the procurement process, the government felt that competition for small packages was \nlimited. Therefore, during the inception mission, the three were combined into one package, and \nbids  were  called  on  21  March  2008.  ADB's  procurement  committee  agreed  with  MOTC's \nevaluation, and the contract was awarded to the lowest responsive bidder on 6 October 2008 at \na  price  of  $22.9  million  including  $2  million  for  contingencies. 18 The  contract  price  for  the \npavement works\u20145 cm (single) layer of asphalt concrete over 56 km\u2014was $6.1 million.  \n \n23.  MOTC  has proposed  procuring  additional  works  through  a variation  of the  original civil \nworks contract instead of through new procurement.  It has received an expression of interest \nfrom the contractor for the additional works and a set of likely unit prices, including prices for the \ntwo new items\u2014the second layer with a 4% bitumen content and the tack coat between layers. \nThe  total  estimated  cost  of  these  works  is  $20.3  million.  However,  supplies  of  imported  road \nconstruction  materials  and  petroleum  products  from  the  traditional  producers,  particularly \nbitumen  and  diesel,  are  becoming  unreliable  and  costly.  This  is  mainly  because  of  the \nincreasing  demand  for  these  materials  in  the  source  countries  and  intermittent  export \nrestrictions. The political changes and the civil unrest in the Kyrgyz Republic in April and June \n2010 also contributed to the price escalation, which is expected to continue in the near future. \nThe government has found suppliers of road construction materials and petroleum products in \nnonmember  countries  of  ADB.  These  are  reliable  and  offer  lower  prices.  The  total  cost \nrepresents  a  relatively  small  amount  of  the  supplementary  loan  (around  5%).  To  enable  the \ngovernment to source from the least expensive producers, and thereby maximize the project\u2019s \ndevelopment  impact  and  economic  efficiency,  it  is  proposed  that  road  construction  materials \nand  petroleum  products  procured  from  nonmember  countries  of  ADB  be  eligible  for  financing \nunder the supplementary loan.  \n                                                 \n17 Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category and Financier (Appendix 2). \n18 The price of the other bid was 15.6% higher. \n\n\fADB  has  performed  comparative  analyses  of  the  material  and  time  cost  of  new \n24. \nprocurement  versus  contract  variation,  and  found  that  a  variation  would  be  more  economical \nthan new procurement.19  The estimated total cost of works, if newly procured, is $26 million20\u2014\nabout $6.0 million more than the contract variation. The indirect cost of delays, and the practical \ndifficulties that a new contractor will face, are also relevant. The earliest a new contractor could \nstart  would  be  June  2011  (the  current  contract  ends  on  30  May  2011),  which  would  push  the \nproject  completion  date  to  the  end  of  2013  (past  the  current  grant  closing  date).  Moreover, \ntransferring the defects liability to a new contractor, and placing the second layer 2 years after \nplacing the first layer of asphalt, are impractical. Therefore, MOTC's proposal is fully justified. \n \n25. \nLikewise,  MOTC's  proposal  for  procuring  the  additional  consulting  services  for \nconstruction  supervision  through  a  contract  variation  is  justified.  The  services  include \napproximately  15  person-months  of  international  consultants'  input  and  60  person-months  of \nnational  consultants'  input.  This  method  of  procurement  will  also  be  less  disruptive  to  the \ncontractor\u2013consultant  working  relationship.  The  services  of  national  and/or  international \nspecialists  to  assist  the  investment  project  implementation  group  with  administering  the \ncontracts  and  solving  complex  problems  will  be  engaged  according  to  national  and  ADB's \nprocurement procedures for recruitment of individual consultants. The firm engaged to carry out \nannual financial audits will continue its services until the end of the project and any additional \ncosts  will  be  covered  from  the  budget  allocation  for  consulting  services.  Under  the  consulting \nservices  category,  MOTC  will  also procure  training  and  related  material  such  as manuals  and \nsoftware on project management to build its capacity for in project management.  \n \n26. \nADB  Management  has,  in  principle,  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing from the loan proceeds for expenditures incurred on eligible civil works and consulting \nservices.  The  government  was  informed  that  advance  contracting  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time) for expenditures to be eligible for retroactive \nfinancing.  Once  the  loan  becomes  effective,  up  to  20%  of  the  proceeds  may  be  used  to \nretroactively  finance  eligible  expenditures  incurred  during  the  period  not  exceeding  6  months \nprior to signing of the loan agreement. The government acknowledges that advance contracting \nprior  to  signing  of  the  loan  agreement  is  undertaken  at  its  own  risk.  Concurrence  by  ADB  on \nadvance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  expenditures.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nMOTC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and  other \nservices  provided  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  revisions  to  the  project  administration \nmemorandum of the approved project.21  \n \n\n                                                 \n19 Comparison of Unit Prices and Cost Estimates (Appendix 2). \n20 At 2009 prices. \n21 Implementation Arrangements and Revisions to the Project Administration Memorandum (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n27. \nThe advantages of the proposed change include a longer service life for the road, more \nopportunities to use recycled materials, and ease of overlaying. The resultant higher speeds will \nreduce travel time and vehicle operating costs. An economic analysis was done assuming that \nthe  cost  consists  of  (i) capital  expenditure,  including  physical  contingencies;  and  (ii)  operation \nand maintenance expenditure, and the benefit consists of (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, \nand (ii) savings in travel time.  \n \n28. \nThe  benefit  stems  from  the  estimated  travel  time  savings  because  the  average  travel \nspeed  on  the  road  will  increase  from  30  kilometers  per  hour  (km/h)  to  60  km/h  (instead  of  40 \nkm/h22 with the approved project). Likewise, the estimated operating costs will decline because \nthe average pavement roughness index will drop from 15.0 to 3.0 (it will drop to only 6.5 with \napproved project). Moreover, the maintenance cost savings, especially winter maintenance, and \nthe  service  life  of  the  pavement  will  be  substantially  higher.  Together,  these  will  yield  a  net \npresent  value  of  $318  million  and  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  19%,  compared  with \n18% for the approved project. A sensitivity test has confirmed that, even with a 20% increase in \ncapital expenditure and a 20% reduction in operational savings, the return will be 14%.23 \n \n29. \nSurfacing will increase access to and from the communities within the corridor because \npublic transport and private vehicles will be able to use the road year-round, thereby reducing \ntravel time to market, social services, and employment and educational opportunities. Although \ndifficult  to  quantify,  health  benefits  are  likely  from  the  substantial  reduction  in  vehicle-induced \ndust  and  noise  from  the  paved  surface  compared  with  the  original  unpaved  surface.  Public \nawareness  campaigns  financed  and  organized  under  the  civil  works  contracts  and  MOTC's \ncontinued  consultation  with  local  communities  will  help  minimize  the  social  implications  of \nincreased traffic. \n \nThe  risk  of  cost  overruns  caused  by  large  increases  in  material  and  equipment  costs \n30. \ncited  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  approved  project  (footnote  2)  will  increase \nbecause of the high value of the material for the new pavement surface. In addition to assuring \nfinancing, the government will negotiate escalation limits or a guaranteed maximum price with \nthe  contractor  to  contain  the  cost  within  the  budget  and  minimize  the  risk  of  cost  overruns. \nMOTC  will  implement  measures  such  bumps  on  the  road,  signs,  and  police  surveillance  to \nreduce the traffic accident risks and noise caused by higher vehicle speeds.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n31. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nproject  administration  memorandum  and  legal  documents.  The  government  has  agreed  with \nADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  supplementary  loan \nagreement. \n\n                                                 \n22 The speed increase will be 30 km/h to 60 km/h only in a 30 km section of the road.   \n23 Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n32. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  supplementary \nloan in various currencies equivalent to SDR15,189,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic for the CAREC \nRegional  Road  Corridor  Improvement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n33. \nI also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in paragraph 23 of this \nreport  that  road  construction  materials  and  petroleum  products  procured  from  nonmember \ncountries of ADB be eligible for financing under the supplementary loan. If this recommendation \nis not approved and the Board only approves the recommendations in paragraph 32, then road \nconstruction  materials  and  petroleum  products  procured  only  from  member  countries  of  ADB \nwill be eligible for financing under the supplementary loan. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n30 August 2010 \n\n\f10 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nContribution to \nreducing transport \ncosts and fostering \nregional trade and \ncooperation among \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), \nTajikistan, and other \nCentral Asian \ncountries \n\nOutcome \nImproved access to \nmarkets and social \nservices \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nEconomic and social \nstatistics produced \nby the National \nStatistics Committee \n \nStatistics from \ninternational \norganizations \n \n \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \nPolitical stability and strong \nmacroeconomic performance in the \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \n \nContinued commitment of Kyrgyz \nRepublic, PRC, and Tajikistan \ngovernments to regional cooperation \n \nContinued external assistance to the \nroad subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand Tajikistan \n \n\n \nEconomic and social \nstatistics produced \nby the National \nStatistics Committee \n \nADB project \ncompletion report \n \nMOTC surveys and \nproject performance \nmanagement \nsystem \n\nAssumptions \nOngoing improvements of parts of the \nCorridor implemented as planned; \nCorridor adequately maintained, and \nborder control processing improved \n \nContinued commitment of the \ngovernments of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan to complete improvement of \nconnecting regional road corridors \n \nNo deterioration in the availability and \nquality of secondary education in the \nproject area \n \nNo deterioration in the availability and \nquality of health care in the project area \n  \nRisk \nForecast of internationally generated \ntraffic may not materialize if above \nassumptions do not prove true. \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \nTajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic \ntrade increases from 27,236 \ntons in 2006 to 250,000 tons \nin 2015 \n \nTajikistan-PRC trade \nincreases from 14,260 tons \nin 2006 to 1,000,000 tons in \n2015 (the PRC\u2019s share of \nTajikistan\u2019s total imports \nincreases from 11% to 20%) \n \nPRC-Afghanistan trade \nincreases from 0 tons in \n2006 to 500,000 tons in \n2015 (the PRC\u2019s share of \nAfghanistan\u2019s total trade \nincreases from 0% to 10%) \n \nDaily international freight \ntraffic on the project road \nincreases from about 10 \ntrucks in 2006 to 120 trucks \nin 2015 \n \nDomestic traffic on the \nproject road increases from \n250 AADT in 2006 to 750 \nAADT in 2015 \n \nTraffic accidents on the \nCorridor reduces from 14 \naccidents per 250 AADT in \n2006 to 14 per 750 AADT in \n2015 \n \nTravel time between Sary \nTash and Karamik reduced \nfrom 4 hours in 2009 to 2.5 \nhours by end-2012 \n \nNumber of children in the \nproject area attending \nsecondary school increases \nfrom 95% in 2007 to 99% in \n2015 \n \nAgricultural, horticultural, \nand livestock production in \nthe project area increases \nfrom 100,000 tons in 2006 to \n160,000 tons in 2015 \n\n\fData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nADB project \ncompletion report \n \n \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \nTimely provision of counterpart funding \nand compliance with road maintenance \nfinancing covenants \n \nSupport from local governments and \ncommunities \n \nRisk \nMaterial prices escalate and work \ninterrupted due to force majeure events \n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nOutputs \n1.
