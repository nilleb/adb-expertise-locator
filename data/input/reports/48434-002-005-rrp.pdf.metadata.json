While  India  has  seen  a  rapid  structural  transformation \nand  achieved  strong  economic  growth  since  1991,  it  must  continue  to  create  economic \nopportunities for its large labor force, which is increasing by about 12 million a year, to sustain its \neconomic growth and realize its demographic dividend.4 With limited prospects for job creation in \nagriculture,  one  of  the  most  pressing  policy  challenges  is  to  create  more  productive  and  well-\npaying  jobs  in  manufacturing  and  services.  Although  India\u2019s  services  sector  has  grown \nsignificantly since 1991,5 manufacturing, which has higher untapped potential, has lagged with a \ncontribution of about 15% to gross domestic product (GDP) and 12% to employment each year \nover  this  period. 6  India\u2019s  National  Manufacturing  Policy  (2011)  calls  for  increasing  the \nmanufacturing  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  at  least  25%  of  GDP  and  enhancing  job  creation  in \nmanufacturing to create 100 million additional jobs by 2022.7 \n \n4. \nIndia\u2019s  industrial  corridors  and  policies  to  stimulate  manufacturing.  India  has \nadopted  an  industrial  corridor  approach  to  stimulate  manufacturing  and  an  Act  East  policy  to \nintegrate  the  Indian  economy  with  Asia\u2019s  dynamic  global  production  networks. 8 The  industrial \ncorridor approach involves the creation of an efficient multimodal transport network supported by \nquality  infrastructure  and  logistics  within  a  defined  geography,  and  a  policy  framework  that \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the   \n\nUnited States. \n\n3    Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2010.

The current total labor force is about 530 million. \n\n5  The share of the services in India\u2019s GDP increased from 30% in the 1950s to 45% in FY1991 and 53% in FY2013. \n6   Manufacturing in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam contributes 25% or more to their GDPs. \n7   Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. 2011. National Manufacturing Policy, 2011. Delhi. \n8   Details  on  the  industrial  corridor  approach  are  available  at  http://www.makeinindia.com/live-projects-industrial-\ncorridor.  The  government  launched  five  industrial corridors  in  its  FY2015  budget.  Under the  Act  East  policy,  India \nplans to have greater strategic role for broader economic and diplomatic engagement across Asia and the Pacific. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfacilitates business operations for integration with global production networks. Industrial corridors \nare central to India\u2019s Make in India initiative, which encourages investments in the manufacturing \nsector  to  stimulate  growth  and  create  high-quality  jobs.  In  line  with  these  policies,  the \ngovernment  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  East  Coast  Economic \nCorridor  (ECEC)\u2014India\u2019s  first  coastal  corridor\u2014extending  over  2,500  kilometers  (km)  from \nKolkata in West Bengal to Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu. The ECEC aims to stimulate growth through \nnetwork externalities, linkage with urban and industrial clusters, and by integrating with regional \nvalue  chains  in  Southeast  and  East  Asia. 9  The  VCIC,  which  covers  more  than  800  km  of \ncoastline in Andhra Pradesh, is proposed to be developed as the first phase of the ECEC.10 \n \n5. \nChallenges to sustaining industrial growth in Andhra Pradesh. In the state of Andhra \nPradesh,  which  has  49.4  million  people  making  it  the  10th  most  populous  state  in  India,  the \nmanufacturing sector contributes 12% to the state\u2019s GDP\u2014lagging the national average of 15%. \nThe  GDP  of  combined  Andhra  Pradesh,  for  which  data  are  available,  grew  by  7.1%  per  year \nfrom FY2003 to FY2013, but only contributed about 4% to national industrial output.11 There is a \npertinent  need  to  usher  in  greater  degree  of  industrialization  in  the  state  by  addressing \nchallenges  such  as  low  industrial  diversification,  and  concentration  of  manufacturing  sector \nemployment  in  small,  labor-intensive,  informal  enterprises  with  low  skills,  productivity,  and \nearnings. Key infrastructure in industrial clusters remains inadequate to support the burgeoning \ndemand  for  efficient  industrial  infrastructure  and  robust  skills  inventory.  In  a  recent  survey, \nAndhra  Pradesh  was  ranked  second  among  all  states  in  India  for  ease  of  doing  business.  12 \nHowever, it needs to further improve its procedures for doing business, labor-related laws, land \nmanagement, and taxation laws if it is to enhance its competitiveness and benchmark itself with \nother countries in the region such as Singapore, the Republic of Korea, and Malaysia.13  \n\n6. \nPolicy  framework,  sector road  map,  and  investment  plan for  the  state. The Andhra \nPradesh  Industrial  Development  Policy  (2015)  aims  to  establish  state-of-the  art  infrastructure, \npromote  manufacturing,  enhance \ninnovation,  and  create  employment \nopportunities across sectors.14 The GoAP has prepared a comprehensive industrial sector road \nmap,  strategic context, policy  framework  and  investment  plan to  enhance  industrial growth  and \ncreate  high-quality  jobs.15   With  support  from  ADB,  the  GoAP  has  also  prepared  a  conceptual \ndevelopment plan and a regional perspective plan for the VCIC, which include an infrastructure \n\ninclusivity, \n\nfoster \n\n                                                \n9  Asian  Development  Bank \n\nInstitute.  2015.

The  regional  perspective  plan  has  identified  the  VCIC\u2019s  high \npotential for generating additional employment and industrial output, which can be achieved from \n2015 to 2045.18 ADB is continuing its support to the GoAP for policy reforms, improving ease of \ndoing  business, master planning  of the  identified  industrial  nodes,  and adopting good  practices \nfor management of economic corridors. The VCICDP, which combines an MFF and a PBL, will \nbuild  on  the  existing  concentration  of  industries and  increase  the  density  and flow  of  economic \nactivities along the VCIC in a business-induced scenario against a business-as-usual scenario.   \n \nThe MFF is an appropriate modality because (i) the GoAP has a policy framework and a \n7. \nsector  road  map  for  infrastructure  investments  and  reforms;  (ii)  the  investments  are  significant \nbut  sequenced,  allowing  the  GoAP  to  use  a  phased  approach  with  a  well-defined  financial \nenvelope; (iii) it allows ADB to have long-term engagement and continuous policy dialogue; and \n(iv) it enhances project readiness, reduces transaction costs, and supports capacity building. The \nPBL  will  complement  the  MFF  through  comprehensive  state-wide  reforms  and  institutional \ndevelopment to help the VCIC realize its full potential for growth and competitiveness.19 The PBL \nis  justified  based  on  (i) the  financial  support  required  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  the \nproposed  policy  actions;  (ii) assessment  of  the  GoAP\u2019s  overall  financial  resources;  (iii) \ndevelopment  financing  needs  in  the  industrial  sector;  (iv) the  GoAP\u2019s  absorptive  capacity;  and \n(v) the requirement for capacity building of institutions in the industrial sector. The VCICDP is in \nline with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India.20  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome   \n\n8. \nThe impact of the VCICDP will be an increased contribution of the manufacturing sector \nto  the  state\u2019s  GDP,  trade,  and  employment. 21  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  growth  and \ncompetitiveness of the VCIC.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe VCICDP will have three outputs. The PBL will support output 1, and the MFF and the \n\n9. \ngrant will support outputs 2 and 3. The PBL will have two tranches each with 12 policy actions. \n                                                \n16  A  node  refers  to  a geographical area along  the  industrial corridor  with high  growth  potential and encompassing  a \nproduction  enclave,  an  urban  center,  and  a  port  along  with  a  logistics  and  distribution  network.  Four  nodes  have \nbeen identified in the VCIC: Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Amaravati region, and Yerpedu\u2013Srikalahasti. An industrial \ncluster refers to an identified geographical area of industrial units within a node. \n\n17  The conceptual development plan is available on the GoAP website.   https://www.apindustries.gov.in/APIndus/ \n\nData/Vizag-Chennai  Industrial  Corridor_Full  Report.pdf.

To  enhance  the \nreadiness of future investment projects, a project development mechanism will be established.31 \n \n20. \nIn  the  industries  sector,  the  designs  of  the  common  effluent  treatment  facilities  comply \nwith marine and inland discharge standards, and have been optimized for expansion of industrial \nunits.  The  new  power  substations  and  transmission  lines  are  optimally  planned  to  meet  the \nincrease  in  electricity  demand  expected  in  the  identified  industrial  clusters.  For  the  road \nsubprojects,  the  designs  have  been  optimized  to  minimize  the  resettlement  impacts.  Reflecting \nthe  GoAP\u2019s  priorities  of  reducing  road  crash  incidents,  a  road  safety  improvement  program \nfocusing on education, enforcement, engineering, and emergency has been included in the MFF. \nFor  the  urban  sector,  investments  have  been  prioritized  in  Visakhapatnam  based  on  the  city\u2019s \ndevelopment  plan,  which  includes  smart  city  and  climate-resilient  planning.  Andhra  Pradesh \nState  Skill  Development  Corporation,  the  nodal  agency  for  skills  development,  will  facilitate \ncapacity building and skills enhancement of workers, entrepreneurs, and students.32  \n \n\n                                                \n30  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Details are in the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32  A policy action under the PBL is the preparation and implementation of a road map for skills development. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of  four  sample \nProject 1 subprojects, one in each sector, range from 15.2% to 37.0%, higher than the economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital,  estimated  at  12.0%,  indicating  sufficient  economic  return. 33  The \nresults are satisfactory against downside risks, including a 20% increase in capital expenditure, a \n20% increase in operating costs, a 20% decrease in benefits, and a 1-year delay. \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  sample  Project  1 \n22. \nsubprojects  in  the  industrial  infrastructure  and  power  sector  range  from  5.6%  to  5.9%,  higher \nthan  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  indicating  sufficient  financial  return.34 The  results  of \nthe  sensitivity  analysis  for  these  sectors  are  satisfactory  against  downside  risks  including \nincreases  in  capital  expenditure  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  construction  delay. \nFor the urban and road sector subprojects, user charges are not expected to recover operation \nand  maintenance  costs.  A  cash  flow  analysis,  including  own  revenues  and  institutionalized \ntransfers from the GoAP to the GVMC and APRDC, is more relevant and confirms that both the \nAPRDC and GVMC have the financial capacity to sustain the services.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nA financial management assessment of the DOIC, PMU, and PIUs shows that they have \n23. \nadequate  capacity  and  expertise  to  implement  the  MFF,  and  the  overall  risk  is  moderate.  A \nfinancial  management  action  plan  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  PMU  and  PIUs  on  financial \nmanagement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  of  India  and  the  GoAP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM. Based on the risk assessments, some of the \nmitigation measures in the VCICDP design aim to (i) enhance capacity of PMU and PIU staff in \nprogram accounting, reporting, and policies and procedures of ADB; (ii) improve audit processes \nof PIUs; and (iii) establish a mechanism, including a website, for regular voluntary disclosure of \nrelevant information to enhance transparency in project implementation. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty  in  the  state  is  estimated  at  13.7%. 35 The  VCICDP  will  contribute  to  poverty \n24. \nreduction  through  infrastructure  development,  and  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  stimulate \neconomic  growth  and  employment  generation. 36  It  will  provide  vulnerable  groups,  including \nwomen, enhanced access to skills development and employment opportunities. Project 1 of the \nMFF and the PBL are classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender equality and social \ninclusion  action  plan 37 and  a  consultation  and  participation  plan  38 have  been  prepared  with \ntargets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocation  for  widespread,  ongoing,  and  meaningful \nparticipation. The GoAP will implement these plans, with support from the project management \nand supervision consultant, and nongovernment and civil society organizations. \n\n                                                \n33 Details are in Economic Analysis: Project 1 of the Multitranche Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n34 Details are in Financial Analysis: Project 1 of the Multitranche Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked \n\n35  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2014.

A  resettlement  framework 39 and  indigenous  peoples  planning \nframework40 have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand  applicable  laws.  Four  resettlement  plans  and  two  due  diligence  reports  for  Project  1  have \nbeen  prepared  in  line  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  will  be  updated  after  detailed \ndesigns. 41  Project  1  resettlement \nincluding \n1,182 significantly  affected,  the  acquisition  of  14.5  hectares  of  private  land,  and  impact  on \n367 structures.  The  proposed  mitigation  measures,  including  capacity  building  of  the  PMU  and \nPIUs, are adequate to address the assessed risks. The safeguard documents are disclosed on \nthe ADB website, and relevant information will be shared with the affected persons. The PBL is \ncategorized as C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples, as it is not anticipated to \nhave any impacts.42   \n \nEnvironmental safeguards. Project 1 of the MFF is categorized as B for environment in \n26. \naccordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  has  been  prepared  for  the  MFF  in  line  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \napplicable  laws. 43  Four  initial  environmental  examination  reports  prepared  for  Project  1 \nsubprojects  show  that  the  subprojects  are  not  likely  to  cause  any  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  any  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  can  be  mitigated \nthrough  appropriate  design  and  good  practices.  Public  consultations  were  conducted  for  all \nProject  1  subprojects  during  preparation  of  the  MFF.  The  initial  environmental  examinations, \nthe \nincluding \nenvironmental assessment requirements of ADB and the government. The PBL is categorized as \nB  for  environment,  and  measures  will  be  taken  for  the  assessment  and  mitigation  of  likely \ninduced impacts resulting from the expected increase in industrialization (footnote 42). \n \n27. \nDisasters  caused  by  natural  hazards  and  climate  change.  Andhra  Pradesh  coastal \nareas  are  prone  to  tropical  cyclones,  which  can  lead  to  significant  losses.  Climate  change \nprojections indicate an increase in temperature of 2.24\u00ba Celsius and an increase in mean annual \nprecipitation  of  81  millimeters  by  2050  in  Andhra  Pradesh.44 The  key  risk  factors  are  sea  level \nrise,  rising  temperatures,  and  increased  frequency  of  flooding  and  tropical  cyclones.  The \nVCICDP  will  incorporate  appropriate  measures  for  risks  related  to  earthquakes,  landslides, \nfloods, tsunami, storm surges, and climate change.   \n \nF. \n\nthe  environmental  management  plan,  are  considered  sufficient \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nto  meet \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.45 The fiduciary risk for the PBL is medium; the \nstate  government\u2019s  public  financial  management  systems  are  adequate  to  mitigate  such  risks. \n\n                                                \n39  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40  Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Environmental and Social Assessment of the Policy Matrix and Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n43  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44  Climate  Change  Risk  Screening\u2013  Climate  Change  Project  Adaptation  Action  Report  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nThe integrated project benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDelays in project \nimplementation, including \navailability of lands, may result \nin cost and time overruns. \nLack of coordination among \nvarious agencies may result in \nsuboptimal outcomes. \nInadequate structure and \nsystems of corridor \nmanagement institutions. \n\nMitigating Measures \nGoAP will assign qualified staff to PMU and PIUs, and minimize staff turnover. The \nproject management and supervision consultant will provide training to PMU and \nPIUs on project management and safeguards. Large contracts will be designed to \nattract competent bidders. GoAP will ensure timely acquisition of lands.  \nThe project steering committee will provide guidance for coordination. The roles, \nresponsibilities, and functions of the PMU and PIUs and the proposed corridor \nmanagement authorities will be clearly delineated. \nGoAP will establish appropriate structures with competent staff for corridor \nmanagement institutions.
