\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  Airport  Capacity \nEnhancement Project. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  airport  capacity  at  Tribhuvan  International  Airport  (TIA)  in \nKathmandu and at Gautam Buddha Airport (GBA) in Lumbini by constructing a parallel taxiway \nextension and hangar apron areas at TIA and a new international terminal building at GBA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic  context.  Nepal\u2019s  economy  grew  by  7%  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2019, \ncompared  to  an  average  rate  of  4.3%  during  FY2009\u2013FY2018.  Before  the  outbreak  of  the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic\u2014despite  some  balance-of-payment  pressure, \nfinancial stability risk, slower growth in neighboring countries, and sluggish remittance inflows\u2014\nthe  near-term  outlook  for  growth  was  moderate  (about  6%),  attributed  to  a  stable  political \nenvironment, a robust tourism industry, and ongoing reconstruction from the earthquake in 2015. \nPublic debt is estimated at 30.1% of gross domestic product as of mid-2019, which is lower than \nin other low-income countries. Debt sustainability analysis indicates that none of the debt burden \nindicators  breach  the  indicative  threshold  values  although  Nepal\u2019s  public  debt  is  projected  to \ngradually increase over the medium term. The COVID-19 shock, however, is expected to severely \nimpact economic activities and lower growth to 2.3% in FY2020 through a significant reduction in \nremittances and tourism, and broader disruptions brought by the pandemic.1 \n \n4. \nImportance  of  air  connectivity  to  the  economy.  Nepal  is  a  landlocked  country  of \ntremendous  geographic  diversity,  with  the  northern rim  of  the  Gangetic  Plain  in  the  south,  the \nHimalaya Mountains in the north, and rugged and hilly terrain in between. Civil aviation is crucial \nto transport, trade, and tourism, and provides indispensable links to hilly and mountainous areas \ninaccessible by other transport modes. Tourism is one of the major economic activities in Nepal \nand  a  top  government  priority.  It  is  estimated  that  tourism  brought  in  $651  million  in  foreign \nexchange  in  FY2019,  equivalent  to  65%  of  goods  exports.2  Travel  and  tourism  generated  an \nestimated  $2.05  billion  (6.7%  of  gross  domestic  product)  in  FY2019,  including  indirect  and \ninduced  contributions.3  Since  more  than  80%  of  international  tourists  come  to  Nepal  by  air, \nimprovement of the civil aviation sector is essential for tourism to support the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. \n \n5. \nChallenges of the civil aviation sector. Nepal has a large airport network,  albeit with \nlow capacity, comprising one international airport, TIA, and 53 domestic airports.4 TIA presently \nserves  as  the  sole  gateway airport  to  Nepal.  It handled  4.1 million  international  passengers  in \n2019,  up  from  1.8 million passengers  in 2008.  It  is  also the country\u2019s  largest  domestic  airport, \n\n \n\nAsia\u2019s Growth Prospects. Manila. \n\nReport. No. 20/96. Washington, DC. \n\n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Supplement: Lockdown, Loosening, and \n\n2  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  2020.  Nepal:  Staff  Report  for  the  2020  Article  IV  Consultation.  IMF  Country \n\n3  World Travel & Tourism Council. 2018. Travel & Tourism Economic Impact 2018 Nepal. London. \n4  Of  these  53  domestic  airports,  22  have  no  scheduled  flights.  Four  airports\u2014Biratnagar,  GBA,  Nepalgunj,  and \nPokhara\u2014are regional hubs that receive passengers transiting to smaller domestic airports. GBA will operate as a \nsecond international airport in 2021. \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\ninternational \n\nterminal  building  handles  more \n\nhandling  3.2  million  domestic  passengers  in  2019\u2014accounting  for  about  half  of  the  country\u2019s \ndomestic air traffic.5 TIA handled 32,439 international flights and 91,816 domestic flights in 2019. \nWith the continued growth of tourism, air traffic is expected to steadily increase at an average of \n3%\u20135% annually.6 \n \n6. \nAlthough TIA plays a critical  role as an  international  gateway and domestic  air  hub,  its \nproximity  to  Kathmandu\u2019s  city  center restrains expansion  beyond the current  airport  boundary. \nAircrafts need to occupy the runway for 2\u20133 additional minutes for takeoff and landing because \nthe inefficient taxiway caps aircraft movements, particularly during peak hours. Furthermore, the \nnumber of parking spots at aprons (9 international and 17 domestic) are not sufficient to handle \npeak-hour parking demand, causing unnecessary waiting time for spot allocation. It also restricts \nthe number of domestic operating aircrafts based in TIA for nighttime parking. Combined with the \nproblem  of  limited  airspace  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  the  insufficient  capacity  of  airside  facilities \nforces airplanes to remain on hold in the sky, leading to frequent flight delays and safety risks. \nFor landside facilities, the international terminal building handled 4.1 million passengers in 2019, \nbeyond  its  annual  capacity  of  3.2  million.  Heavy  congestion  and  lower  quality  of  services  are \nthan \nobserved  during  peak  hours; \n2,200 passengers per hour, about 70% more than its per-hour capacity of 1,350. The number of \ninternational passengers is projected to increase to 6.1 million by 2028. TIA will have to use its \nexisting space more efficiently, while more flights must be routed through other airports. \n \n7. \nIn  addition,  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Nepal  (CAAN)  has  been  working  to  improve \naviation  safety.  The  Universal  Safety  Oversight  Audit  Programme  under  the  International  Civil \nAviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations specialized agency, is responsible for conducting \naviation safety oversight audits to identify deficiencies of its member states. CAAN has achieved \nsignificant  progress  in  improving  its  safety  oversight  capability.  In  its  2017  audit  of  CAAN,  the \nUniversal Safety Oversight Audit Programme raised the rate of effective implementation of CAAN \nfrom  46.96%  in  2009  to  66.76%  in  2017,  above  the  Global  Aviation  Safety  Plan  (GASP) \nbenchmark  of  60%.  CAAN  has  prepared  the  Nepal  Aviation  Safety  Plan,  2018\u20132022  in \ncongruence  with  the  ICAO\u2019s  GASP,  to  continually  enhance  aviation  safety  performance  by \nreducing  fatalities  and  the  risk  of  fatalities  through  the  development  and  implementation  of  a \nharmonized aviation safety strategy.7 \n \n8. \nThe  longer-term  plan  to  improve  international  aviation  capacity  and  safety  in  Nepal  is \ntwofold:  (i)  more  efficient  use  of  the  available  areas  within  the  existing  TIA  premises,  and \n(ii) distribution  of  the  concentrated  international  air  traffic  to  other  airports\u2014GBA  and  Pokhara \nAirport. To that end, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is also supporting the upgrade of GBA \ninto an international airport through the South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project.8 \n \n9. \nGovernment reform agenda in civil aviation sector. Nepal has maintained a traditional \ncivil aviation sector structure whereby the functions of regulation, safety oversight, and service \nprovision are carried out by one entity: CAAN. The roles of regulator and service provider lodged \nin  a  single  organization  create  a  conflict  of  interest.  The  regulatory  function  may  not  provide \n\n \n\n2019.

There are also repercussions on aviation safety, which have \nbeen noted and highlighted by international aviation agencies. ICAO\u2019s GASP, 2020\u20132022 states \nthat an independent regulatory authority should be established and maintained, which includes \nseparation  of  oversight  functions  from  service  provision  functions  where  these  exist  within  the \nauthority.9 To remedy this situation, the Nepal Aviation Safety Plan (footnote 7) has named the \nbifurcation  of  CAAN  as  a  priority  measure  to  comply  with  international  standards.  ADB  is \nsupporting the bifurcation of CAAN through the Civil Aviation Sector Improvement Program.10 \n \n10. \nTribhuvan International Airport master plan. To address the issues of inefficient airside \nfacilities and overcrowded terminal buildings with poor service standards, CAAN prepared the TIA \nmaster plan for infrastructure improvement up to 2028 under ADB assistance.11 The master plan \naims  at  enhancing  the  safety  and  efficiency  of  aircraft  operations  while  also  contributing  to \nincreasing  the  capacity  of  airside  infrastructure.  The  master  plan  also  proposes  a  new \ninternational  terminal  building  to  be  constructed  to  accommodate  the  increasing  number  of \ninternational passengers.12 \n \n11. \nTribhuvan  International  Airport.  ADB  had  supported  the  initial  phase  of  TIA \ndevelopment  in  accordance  with  the  master  plan  through  the  Air  Transport  Capacity \nEnhancement Project, the scope of which included (i) extension of the northern part of the parallel \ntaxiway to reduce the use of its single runway for taxiing; (ii) expansion of the international apron \nareas to accommodate more aircraft in TIA; (iii) extension of the runway by 300 meters south to \nmake it a 3,350-meter-long runway; and (iv) provision of air navigation equipment, including an \napproach  lighting  system,  to  comply  with  international  safety  standards.13  Because  of  poor \nperformance of the selected civil works contractor and subsequent delay in re-tenders following \nrepackaging  and  redesign  of  the  terminated  contract,  the  loan  was  closed  in  December  2018 \nwithout fully completing the original scope of work.14 The remaining scope is being implemented \nwith government funds and is expected to be completed by 2023. However, further development \nof  airside  facilities  is  required  to  complete  the  TIA  master  plan  to  meet  international  safety \nstandards as well as the forecast demand in 2028. \n \n12. \nGautam Buddha Airport. ADB also supports upgrading GBA to a full international airport \nby  (i)  constructing  (a)  a  3,000-meter  runway,  (b)  a  1,900-meter  taxiway,  (c)  international  and \ndomestic aprons, (d) control towers, and (e) an international and domestic passenger terminal \nbuilding  (phase  1)  with  floor  space  of  15,000 square meters;  and  (ii)  supplying  navigation  and \nsafety equipment (footnote 8). The project is scheduled to be completed in December 2020. The \nterminal  building  needs  to  be  expanded  further  (phase  2)  to  handle  future  international  travel \n\nA). \n\n \n\n9  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 2019.

Manila. \n12 The construction of a new international terminal building at TIA is not included in the proposed project because (i) the \nconstruction requires relocation of the existing hangars and domestic aprons to clear the planned construction site \nin advance; and (ii) it requires a large amount (about $500 million) of finance. The construction of domestic aprons \nwill be implemented instead. Financing for the international terminal building will be considered in a separate loan \nwith due attention to implementation and progress of the project. \n\n13 ADB.  2009.

The \nimprovement of  TIA,  which is  currently  Nepal\u2019s  only  international  airport, and  the  upgrading  of \nGBA will improve Nepal\u2019s connectivity with neighboring countries. The project is included in the \nSASEC Operational Plan 2016\u20132025 Update.16 \n \n14. \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) operational priority 6 (strengthening governance \nand  institutional  capacity)  by  strengthening  CAAN\u2019s  institutional  capacity  in  project,  contract \nmanagement,  and  procurement  through  training  programs;  (ii)  operational  priority  7  (fostering \nregional cooperation and integration) by enhancing connectivity and tourism through international \ngateway  development  in  a  landlocked  economy;  and  (iii)  operational  priority  2  (accelerating \nprogress in gender equality) by improving women\u2019s access  to basic services, such as facilities in \nthe  passenger  terminal  building  at  GBA.17  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership \nstrategy for Nepal 2020\u20132024 and is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Nepal, \n2020\u20132022.18 \n \n15. \nEffects  of  COVID-19  on  tourism.  The  COVID-19  outbreak  has  had  serious  negative \nimpacts  on  Nepal\u2019s  aviation  and  tourism  sectors.  All  international  flights  were  temporarily \nsuspended in March 2020, and the government had to cancel the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, \nwhich was launched in January 2020 to attract 2 million visitors. The depth and duration of the \nshock are still uncertain. There are several scenarios on how soon international connectivity will \nbe restored, depending partly on the length of containment measures adopted by Nepal and other \nmajor economies. Nonetheless, the tourism industry will remain a key pillar of Nepal\u2019s economy \nover  the  medium  term,  although  its  business  model  may  have  to  be  adjusted  under  the  \u201cnew \nnormal.\u201d Therefore, directing well-targeted investments into key airports and creating an enabling \nenvironment  for  the  improvement  of  the  civil  aviation  sector  are  still  critical  to support  Nepal\u2019s \nlong-term economic development (footnote 18). The investments and performance improvement \nof the civil aviation sector will underpin tourism to prepare for accommodating the future bounce-\nback of international travelers and kick-starting the economy after the pandemic. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  tourism-led  economic  development  in \nNepal enhanced.19 The project will have the following outcome: safety, capacity, and efficiency of \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n15 The terminal building currently being constructed will be converted to and used as a domestic terminal building after \n\nthe proposed international terminal building under the project is completed. \n\n16 ADB. 2020.

The loan will finance the \nconstruction of TIA airside facilities such as a parallel taxiway extension and hangar aprons. The \nextension of the parallel taxiway will allow aircrafts to reach the end of the southern runway with \nminimal encroachment onto the main runway at TIA, improving efficiency and safety. The hangar \narea  development  will  facilitate  relocation  of  existing  hangars  and  construction  of  new  Nepal \nAirlines hangars to cater for large aircrafts (up to the Airbus A330) on the east side of the runway, \nwhich will expedite implementation of the TIA master plan and enhance aviation safety. \n \n18. \nOutput  2:  International  terminal  building  at  Gautam  Buddha  Airport  constructed \n(Terminal 2). The new international terminal building  at GBA will (i) use solar panels and energy-\nefficient  lighting  for  energy  self-sufficiency,  and  (ii)  incorporate  the  use  of  local  materials  and \ninclude gender  equality and social  inclusion  (GESI) elements to make  the terminal  a model  to \nemulate  for  airports  in  Nepal.21  The  new  terminal  building  will  greatly  increase  international \ncapacity at GBA, and could also serve to alleviate pressure on TIA by diverting some international \nflights from TIA to GBA. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Next  phase  of  the  Tribhuvan  International  Airport  works  design \ncompleted. The loan will finance (i) the design of (a) a new international terminal building with \nspecial  GESI  facilities  and  features,  located  between  the  existing  international  and  domestic \nterminal buildings, and (b) a new flight control tower; (ii) the redesign of the existing international \nterminal building to be converted into the domestic terminal building; and (iii) the exploration of \noptions  for  public\u2013private  partnership  participation  in  TIA  and  GBA.  The  next  phase  of  works \nwould further expand the capacity and efficiency of TIA. \n \nLessons  learned.  Review  missions  of  ADB-funded  projects  observed  that  CAAN\u2019s \n20. \ncapacity for (i) contract management and procurement, and (ii) investment preparation needs to \nbe strengthened to improve implementation performance. Lessons from the review missions are \nincorporated in this project. Detailed design for output 1 has already been completed while that \nfor output 2 started in February 2020 and is expected to be completed by January 2021. CAAN\u2019s \nprocurement capacity will be strengthened through recruitment of individual consultants. \n \n21. \nInstitutional  strengthening.  The  project  will  strengthen  CAAN\u2019s  contract,  project \nmanagement,  and  procurement  capabilities  through  procurement  orientation  and  training \norganized by ADB, secondment of additional experienced CAAN staff to the implementation team, \nas  well  as  recruitment  of  individual  consultants  for  project  and  contract  management.  The \nattached  technical  assistance  for  the  Civil  Aviation  Sector  Improvement  Program  will  further \nstrengthen  CAAN\u2019s  capabilities  in  developing  institutional  management  strategies,  gender \nequality, social inclusion initiatives, and enhancement of communication strategies.22 \n \nC. \n \n22. \n\nADB has been Nepal\u2019s key partner in the development of its civil aviation sector.

Technical Assistance to Nepal: Supporting the Civil Aviation Sector Improvement Program. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f2009, ADB has had 5 completed and ongoing projects totaling $198.50 million in loans and grants. \nThese  projects  have  supported  Nepal  in  planning  for  future  investments  on  air  transport, \nimproving the facilities of airports, and implementing reforms to strengthen institutions, which aim \nto  enhance  the  capacity  and  safety  of  airports  and  further  develop  the  tourism  sector  of  the \ncountry. The proposed project will create synergy as it complements these earlier interventions, \nparticularly  the  recently-approved  policy-based  loan  (footnote  10)  that  will  reorganize  and \nstrengthen  the  oversight  and  service  functions  for  civil  aviation.  Apart  from  fostering  regional \ncooperation and integration through improved connectivity and tourism development, the project \nalso incorporates climate change and gender features in the construction and design of the airport \nfacilities.  It  will  likewise  promote  public-private  partnerships  and  will  explore  opportunities  for \ncollaboration in the next phases of works for TIA. \n \nD. \n \n23. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $198 million (Table 1). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nTIA airside facilities completed in accordance with the TIA master plan \nInternational terminal building at GBA constructed \nNext phase of the TIA works design completed \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancial Charges During Implementationd \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \nTotal (A+B+C) \nGBA = Gautam Buddha Airport, TIA = Tribhuvan International Airport. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.  \na  Includes taxes and duties of $25 million.

The \nengineering design is based on site condition surveys and field investigations, and targets optimal \neconomy and construction efficiency in accordance with international design standards. The new \nterminal building at GBA will include the use of solar panels and energy-efficient lighting, and it \nwill  also  incorporate  the  use  of  local  materials.  To  enhance  resilience  against  severe  natural \nhazards, climatic events, and threats, earthquake-resistant standards and hydrological hazards \nhave been considered. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment was prepared to assess the \npotential impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, earthquake, and other hazards on \nthe project components.25  \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \n31. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.26\n The  construction  of  a  parallel  taxiway  extension  and  hangar \napron areas at TIA will support potential continued aircraft and passenger traffic growth, while the \nconstruction of a new international terminal building at GBA will support the additional capacity \nrequired to facilitate new international aircraft and passenger traffic targeted from 2021 onwards. \nThe  economic  benefits  from  both  improvements  will  result  from  induced  new  aircraft  and \npassenger traffic movements. This induced new traffic will generate several types of economic \nbenefits, including an increase in tourist spending, and additional aeronautical and commercial \nrevenues received by the airports. The economic internal rate of return for the investments at TIA \nis estimated at 15.5%, 12.1% for the investments at GBA, and 14.7% in total. Sensitivity analysis, \ntested with possible unfavorable scenarios for the project\u2019s economic viability, indicates that both \ninvestments independently or combined remain viable under all adverse scenarios tested.27 \n \nC. \n \n32. \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines.28 It assessed the costs and earnings that would accrue using the discounted cash flow \nmethod, and it calculated the financial internal rate of return. The evaluation assumes incremental \nrevenues  generated  by  CAAN  through  additional  aeronautical  and  commercial  services  along \nwith additional O&M costs for continued operations. All financial calculations were made in 2020 \nprices with no adjustment for inflation. The base value of financial internal rate of return was found \nto be 7.7%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.01%. Various adverse \nscenarios were tested under sensitivity analysis, and the project is likely to be viable under all \nsuch adverse scenarios. In case project revenues are not sufficient to service O&M obligations, \n\nSustainability \n\n \n\n25 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Manila. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nthese will be borne by the government and CAAN from their own sources. CAAN has a strong \nfinancial position; its annual profit for FY2018 was NRs4.3 billion and it has sufficient accumulated \nreserves to provide for O&M requirements of the project. To enhance the use and benefits of the \nairport, output 3 will support the design of the next phase of TIA works. Extension of a parallel \ntaxiway and hangar area development at TIA are pivotal for the airport\u2019s further enhancement and \ndevelopment. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  considered  the  capacity  of  CAAN  on  fund  flow \narrangements;  budgeting;  staffing;  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems;  financial \ninformation systems; and internal and external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, \nCAAN has reasonable capacity to handle the project from a financial management perspective. \nCAAN (i) has experience in implementing ADB-funded projects; (ii) has accounting and finance \nfunctions  at  the  entity  and  project  levels  that  are  adequately  staffed;  (iii)  prepares  entity-level \nfinancial statements in accordance with the Nepal Financial Reporting Standards; and (iv) submits \nproject financial statements generally on time. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management \nrisk  of  CAAN  is  moderate  mainly  because:  (i)  the  internal  audit  function  is  weak,  (ii)  project \nquarterly reports need to be strengthened by incorporating financial and disbursement reports, \n(iii) there are qualified audit opinions on entity-level financial statements of CAAN and delays in \nfinalization  of  audited  entity  financial  statements  for  FY2018  and  FY2019,  and  (iv) human \nresource  capacity  needs  to  be  supplemented  through  training  on  ADB  financial  management \nrequirements and disbursement procedures. An action plan has been prepared to address the \nfinancial management risk. \n \n34. \nProcurement. Procurement and consultant recruitment will follow the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The amended Public Procurement Act (2017) and Public \nProcurement Regulations (2017) of Nepal are generally acceptable to ADB and encompass best \ninternational procurement practices. CAAN has significant experience with ADB\u2019s procurement \nrequirements, and to enhance CAAN project staff\u2019s knowledge, ADB will provide orientation and \nprocurement training during implementation. Advance actions to recruit construction supervision \nconsultants and invite bids for the two civil works packages at TIA will start in October 2020. Value \nfor money considerations have been incorporated during strategic procurement planning. \n \n35. \nValue for money. Through strategic procurement planning and a risk-managed approach, \noptimization of value for money for the project has been sought as summarized in this paragraph \nand  as  detailed  in  the  PAM  (footnote  24).  To  ensure  high-quality  design  and  construction \nsupervision consulting services, international advertisement with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 has \nbeen applied. For works contracts, the following has been applied: (i) competitive bidding using \ninternational  bidders, \nmultiple-contract  bidding,  (ii)  making  contract  sizes  attractive \n(iii)  domestic preference, (iv) prior review procedure, (v) seeking higher performance securities \nfor  abnormally  low  and/or  unbalanced  bids,  (vi)  applying  a  14-day  standstill  period  to  ensure \ntransparency  of  the  procurement  process,  (vii)  requiring  the  lead  partner  of  a  joint  venture \ncontractor to take a leadership role, and (viii) providing high percentage of mobilization advance \nbut paid in stages to ensure a smooth cash flow under each contract. Furthermore, to address \nthe  issue  of  construction  delays,  incentive  (bonus)  clauses  are  being  introduced  in  the \nconstruction contracts for early completion. \n \n36. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  (MOCTCA).  The \n\nto \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary measures  are described  in the  PAM  (footnote \n24). Integrity due diligence was conducted and no significant integrity risks were identified.29 \n \nE. \n \n37. \nPoverty. The overall headcount poverty in Nepal fell from 41.8% in 1996 to 25.2% in 2011 \nand  is  estimated  to  have  further  declined  to  18.7%  in  2018,  but  a  large  percentage  of  the \npopulation  remains  vulnerable.  Poverty  rates  also  differ  by  gender  and  social  groups,  by \necological belt, and by province. For instance, in 2011, the incidence of poverty among Dalits was \n43.6% in the hill areas and 38.2% in the low-lying Terai region, compared with Newars (10.3%) \nand hill  Brahmins (10.3%).  Similarly,  15%  of  hill  Dalits  and 44%  of  Terai  Dalits  were  landless. \nWith  limited  economic  opportunities  at  home, many  youths  are migrating for  employment.  The \nmain challenge for Nepal is to ensure employment-centric economic growth to reap the benefits \nof its demographic dividend. On a larger scale, better aviation facilities, such as those at TIA and \nGBA, will have a positive ripple effect on other sectors such as agriculture, industry, energy, and \ntransport. Local communities that depend on tourism will have more opportunities and access to \nemployment,  as  well  as  improved  basic  services  delivery.  Overall,  the  economic  impact  of \nimproved civil aviation facilities in these two airports will have tremendous impact on the country\u2019s \npoverty alleviation programs and local employment. \n \nGender. The project will benefit from the ICAO\u2019s commitment to enhance gender equality \n38. \nby 2030 at all professional and higher levels of employment in the global aviation sector, as well \nas its support for the ICAO resolution on Gender Equality Programme Promoting the Participation \nof Women in the Global Aviation Sector. The ICAO\u2019s commitment will be realized by incorporating \nGESI elements across existing and new civil aviation infrastructure at TIA and GBA, and making \nsuch infrastructures responsive to the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the differently \nabled; universally accessible; and safe. Likewise, GESI elements will include appropriate conduct \nof GESI capacity building and sensitization among CAAN officers, staff, contractors, and service \nproviders. CAAN, having a dedicated project directorate, will carry out the operationalization of \nthese design elements. The project is categorized some gender elements. \n \n39. \nPublic health and safety. The project aims to promote public health and safety through \nthe prevention of non-safeguards-related risks, such as sexually transmitted infections (including \nHIV/AIDS), COVID-19, human trafficking, sexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse, during the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  project.  Labor  camps  during  project  construction  will  have \nregular orientations on these issues. CAAN staff and contractors will also undergo orientation so \nthat prevention and management of all social risks are adequately handled. \n \n40. \nLabor standards. CAAN and its contractors shall ensure that the works contracts under \nthe  project  (i)  follow  all  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Government  of  Nepal;  and  (ii)  include \nprovisions to the effect that contractors will follow and implement all statutory provisions on labor, \nincluding national core labor standards (not employing or using children as labor, providing equal \npay  for  equal  work,  and  providing  a  respectful  workplace);  health;  safety;  welfare;  sanitation; \nworking conditions; and compliance with national requirements for COVID-19 prevention. Strict \ncompliance by contractors will be monitored. Contracts will also include clauses for termination in \ncase of breach of the stated provisions by the contractors. There will be routine orientation for all \ncontractors, including laborers, on national core labor standards with a special focus on gender \nequality in wages, health, safety, and hygiene issues on the work site. \n\n29 ADB. 2003.

No critical habitats or cultural heritage sites at TIA \nand GBA will be directly affected. \n \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  for  each  site.31  Major  anticipated \n43. \nimpacts  for  both  sites  include  (i)  increased  levels  of  air  and  water  pollution  and  noise  during \nconstruction, (ii) occupational health and safety risks for workers, (iii) potential alteration of the \ndrainage system from surface runoff, (iv) traffic congestion, and (v) COVID-19 pandemic risks. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nfor  major \nenvironmental  impacts  in  all  phases  of  the  project;  the  responsible  entities  to  implement  and \nmonitor the mitigating measures; and the cost of implementing proposed measures. Likewise, the \nEMP outlines the institutional arrangements on the responsibilities of different parties with regard \nto environmental management and monitoring. The MOCTCA, as the executing agency, will have \nthe  overall  responsibility  for  environmental  safeguards,  whereas  CAAN,  as  the  implementing \nagency  and  with  prior  experience  implementing  ADB-funded  projects,  will  be  responsible  for \ncompliance  monitoring.  A  separate  environmental  management  unit  will  be  established  to \n(i) monitor EMP implementation; (ii) coordinate with the safeguards and technical implementation \nteam on safeguards compliance; and (iii) undertake corrective measures, document environment \nmonitoring  details,  and  report  progress.  In  addition,  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  was \nprepared for each project site to monitor various environmental parameters (such as air and water \nquality,  noise  and  vibration,  community  and  occupational  health  and  safety  issues,  flora  and \nfauna).  The  approved  initial  environmental  examinations  are  disclosed  in  ADB  website  on \n3 September  2020,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  requirements.  CAAN  will \nprepare  and  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  (EMRs)  during  the \nconstruction phase, and annual EMRs during the operation phase. \n \n44. \nThe baseline environmental study and public consultations have not yet been undertaken \nbecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, but CAAN has assured ADB that these will be done prior to \nconstruction activities. \n \n45. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  have  two  locations:  TIA  and \nGBA.  At  TIA,  all  project  activities  will  be  within  the  confines  of  existing  airport  premises  and \ntherefore do not necessitate land acquisition. At GBA, CAAN acquired 25.76 hectares (ha) of land \nadjoining GBA\u2019s existing premises using CAAN\u2019s own resources. This land will be used for the \ndevelopment of the new terminal 2 building and associated facilities (such as apron, car park, and \nutilities)  and  other  future  facilities  as  per  the  GBA  master  plan.  The  land  acquired  consists  of \n482 parcels of land belonging to 284 landowner households and three business entities. Of these, \nCAAN has already compensated all landowner households and two of the three business entities \nfor  22.98  ha  of  land  (89.2%  of  the  total  25.76  ha  of  land),  and  ownership  has  already  been \ntransferred to CAAN. The remaining 2.78 ha of land belong to Lumbini Distillery. Compensation \nfor this land is the only pending action to complete the acquisition and transfer of all land required \nfor terminal 2. Due diligence has been undertaken to assess the consistency  in land valuation \n\n30 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n31 The detailed design for output 1 has already been completed and the design for output 2 started in February 2020, \n\nwith a final report expected by January 2021. \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nand compensation methods with the applicable national laws and standards. The due diligence \nreport  summarizes  project  activities,  land  acquisition  impacts,  compensation  standards,  and \ncorrective actions  to  ensure that  all  pending  activities,  including those  related  to previous  land \nacquisition, are fully implemented. \n \n46. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  activities  at  TIA  and  GBA  are  not \nexpected  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples\u2019  groups,  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  Adequate  consultations  and  disclosure  were  undertaken  to  ensure  relevant \nproject  information  was  properly  communicated  to  households  and  broader  communities  of \nvarious ethnicities around the project areas. \n \n47. \nCAAN will establish a safeguards desk in each project implementation unit, composed of \none environment specialist, one sociologist (who will also cover gender), and other safeguards-\nrelated  staff  to  (i)  monitor  safeguards  implementation,  (ii)  coordinate  with  the  safeguards  and \ntechnical implementation team on safeguards compliance, and (iii) undertake corrective actions. \nThe  intended  capacity  within  the  safeguards  desk  will  be  adequate  to  address  the  existing \nsafeguards activities and risks around the project. ADB will provide oversight to build the capacity \nof CAAN on safeguards implementation. During implementation, CAAN, through its construction \nsupervision consultant, will prepare semiannual EMRs and submit them to ADB for disclosure. \n \nG. \n \n48. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak governance and limited \nabsorption capacity of \nGovernment of Nepal agencies for \ncapital expenditure and adequacy \nof operation and maintenance \nbudget \n\nProcurement: Inability of bidders \nto obtain sufficient landfill volume \n\nCAAN\u2019s internal audit function is \ngenerally weak \nOrganization and staff capacity: \nPIUs have insufficient \nexperienced staff to efficiently \nundertake the procurement \nrequired to implement the project, \nand some staff in the PIUs may \nbe new to ADB\u2019s procurement \npolicies and regulations \nChange of government policy on \nthe civil aviation sector regulatory \nframework hampers project \n\n \n\n \n\nThe government has initiated procurement and financial management and \npublic procurement reforms nationally and locally. ADB will assist with these \nin conjunction with other development partners, including measures to \nmitigate fiduciary risks while promoting accountability and transparency. ADB \nwill collaborate with other development partners to strengthen the capacity of \nintegrity institutions, such as the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of \nAuthority and the National Vigilance Centre. Close monitoring by ADB of \nactivities will reduce the country-specific risk in the project. \nCAAN has prepared a quarry and borrow area study of available quarries and \nborrow areas around Kathmandu and the estimated volume that each quarry \ncan supply. The study will be made available to bidders with substantial \nlandfill volumes so that they are informed and can arrange commercial \ncontracts with suppliers. \nThere is an internal audit section in CAAN that conducts internal audits on a \nneed basis. CAAN will carry out internal audits for the project semiannually. \nADB will provide increased procurement oversight through its Nepal Resident \nMission. CAAN will deputize two additional senior engineers in the TIA PIU \nwho have experience in procurement through other projects implemented at \nTIA through CAAN internal funding. The procurement capacity of staff at both \nPIUs will also be developed through training and orientation provided by ADB \nand consultants. Consultants will also support CAAN on procurement (bid \nevaluation process). \n\nStrong incentive exists in the government to complete the civil aviation sector \nreforms to comply with international practices and recommendations. ADB \nwill closely monitor the progress of related legislation and continue policy \n\n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fRisks \nimplementation \n\nMitigation Measures \n\ndialogues with the government involving, if necessary, international \norganizations and other development partners, including European Union \nmember states. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CAAN = Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, PIU = project implementation unit, TIA = \nTribhuvan International Airport. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n49. \nThe  government,  MOCTCA  and  CAAN  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  requirements,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  financial \nmanagement, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n50. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n\nThe government and CAAN have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n51. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000 to Nepal for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Airport Capacity \nEnhancement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  concessional  terms,  with  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n28 October 2020 \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nTourism-led economic development in Nepal enhanced (National Tourism Strategic Plan 2016\u20132025)a \n\n14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n\nSafety, capacity, and \nefficiency of air travel \nto and from Nepal \nimproved \n \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
