THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support the effective and efficient \nimplementation of projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Vanuatu. A number \nof projects are facing implementation problems and delays because of the constrained project \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  the  government\u2019s \nVanuatu Project Management Unit (VPMU). To minimize the reoccurrence of similar problems in \nfuture operations, the TA will also support the strengthening of institutional and policy frameworks \nfor sound and sustainable project management in Vanuatu.  \n \n2.  Significant capacity weaknesses, particularly in the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public \nUtilities (MIPU) and VPMU, have severely affected the quality and timeliness of project execution \nby the agencies responsible for infrastructure operations in Vanuatu. The government staff \ninvolved in projects is limited, and they lack experience and skills. The Vanuatu Interisland \nShipping Support Project (VISSP) is facing serious delays and is unable to deliver results because \nof poor consultant performance and failed designs.1 To help the government meet its urgent \nneeds for technical expertise in managing project tasks, the TA will provide consultant support to \nfill gaps in human resources and improve the skills and abilities of national staff to successfully \nimplement projects. For VISSP, this includes redesigning wharves and procuring a new civil works \ncontract. The primary focus of the TA will be to improve the implementation performance of VISSP, \nbut the TA will also support the Cyclone Pam Schools Project and the Vanuatu Energy Access \nProject to ensure timely implementation.2 In addition to addressing the immediate capacity \nbuilding needs of MIPU, VPMU, and other ministries, government staff will have increased \nopportunities to work with international experts and acquire technical knowledge through on-the-\njob training.  \n \n3.  To identify systematic issues affecting project performance, ADB and the Government of \nVanuatu  held  a comprehensive  country  portfolio  review mission  in April  2018.  The  review \nreinforced the finding that it is critical for Vanuatu to have an enabling institutional setup for strong \nand sustainable project management. Therefore, the TA will support two interlinked endeavors. \nFirst, the project team\u2014through the TA\u2014will review VPMU\u2019s organizational structure, internal \ncapacity, and defined roles and responsibilities to propose alternative models for effective project \nmanagement. A key objective of the review is to assist the government in establishing optimal \nlines of responsibilities between VPMU and MIPU on project management and to improve project \nownership. Second, the TA will strengthen the government\u2019s public financial management (PFM) \nand investment management practices by supporting the implementation of Vanuatu\u2019s PFM road \nmap.  TA  activities  will  focus  on  medium-term  fiscal  planning,  economic  analysis  of  public \ninvestments, and better data management through a modern financial management information \nsystem. This will lead to better-prepared projects, a broader understanding of the requirements \nto manage significant public investments, and proper resourcing, including lifetime costs (i.e., \n                                                 \n1 ADB.  2011.

The TA is in line with the government\u2019s 2015 National \nRecovery and Economic Strengthening Program Plan to strengthen the country\u2019s economic \nresilience by developing its domestic institutional and human resources and capacity.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The TA will support three interlinked outputs: (i) VPMU\u2019s capacity for implementing \nongoing projects strengthened; (ii) measures to improve government project management and \ninstitutional arrangements recommended, and implementation supported; and (iii) implementation \nof Vanuatu\u2019s PFM road map for improved public investments supported. These outputs are \naligned with the recommendations of the Vanuatu Transport Plan 2030, currently being prepared \nwith ADB\u2019s support.4 The project team, through the TA, will act on key recommendations for \nstrengthening the institutional setup for project management made by the April 2018 Vanuatu \ncountry portfolio review mission.   \n \n5.  Output 1: Vanuatu Project Management Unit\u2019s capacity for implementing ongoing \nprojects strengthened. The TA will provide critical expertise to VPMU for stronger project \nimplementation. It will fund international and national consultants to help bring VISSP back on \ntrack, ensure safeguards compliance of the Vanuatu Energy Access Project, and strengthen \nmanagement of the Cyclone Pam Schools Reconstruction Project. The consultants will provide \non-the-job training for national staff to improve their technical knowledge and capacity for them to \nlead more demanding assignments independently. VPMU will hire junior graduates as trainees to \nincrease its future human resource capacity.  \n \n6.  Output 2: Measures to improve government project management and institutional \narrangements recommended, and implementation supported. Building on existing analyses, \nthe  project  team,  through  the  TA,  will  assess  the  institutional  arrangements  for  project \nimplementation and propose a business model that is acceptable to the government. The \nbusiness  model  will  enable  sustainable  project  management,  build  domestic  capacity,  and \nstrengthen government ownership and accountability.5 Identifying and developing this model will \nrequire intensive consultations and consensus-building with VPMU, the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Management (MFEM), the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Council of Ministers, and other \nministries. Once the government has approved a preferred model for project management, the \nTA will support its implementation. Through the TA, the project team will \n(i)  review the recommendations made under the existing analyses and assess their \nrelevance given the problems that have arisen since the report was finalized \n(footnote 6); \n(ii)  review the allocation of project implementation responsibilities between VPMU, \nMIPU, and other ministries;  \n(iii)  review regional and international practices on project management arrangements; \n(iv)  support the government with consultations and consensus-building; \n(v)  assist the government in identifying an optimal project management model;  \n(vi)  ensure the consistency of the recommendation with the Vanuatu Transport Plan \n2030;  \n(vii)  prepare a report with recommendations to the Council of Ministers, if necessary; \nand  \n                                                 \n3  Government  of  Vanuatu.  2015.

Output 3: Implementation of Vanuatu\u2019s public financial management road map for \nimproved public investments supported. Sound PFM and governance are prerequisites for \nsustained investment and growth. To complement the project and institutional-level support under \noutputs 1 and 2, the TA will also help the government to implement its PFM road map. However, \nthe government faces challenges to implement the PFM road map. The TA will respond to the \ngovernment\u2019s needs for ADB to assist in three specific areas: \n(i)  implementing key PFM road map actions, including prioritizing and sequencing for \nreforms;   \n(ii)  reviewing  options  for  improving  the  government\u2019s  financial  management \ninformation system, which at present does not meet the country\u2019s needs; and \n(iii)  supporting MFEM to improve economic analysis of significant public investments, \nwhich will be considered in the national budgeting processes; and supporting \nMFEM to design and implement a medium-term expenditure framework. The \ngovernment needs to establish and execute a proper medium-term expenditure \nframework if it is to budget public resources effectively and efficiently to fulfil \nnational and sector strategies and outcomes, and strengthen the coordination of \ndonor-funded projects.  \n \n8.  These efforts aim to improve the broad policy environment for public investment and PFM. \nDepending on the government\u2019s preferred approach, ADB can provide follow-up support through \na policy-based grant, a stand-alone project, or a combination of both in a sector development \nprogram.6 \n \n9.
