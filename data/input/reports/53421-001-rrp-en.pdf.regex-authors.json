I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Solomon Islands for the Land and Maritime Connectivity \nProject. \n \n2.  The project will support the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 35 kilometers (km) of \nroads in and around the capital, Honiara; the construction of two provincial wharves at Ahanga \nand Kira Kira; and the reconstruction and improvement of the old wharf in Honiara International \nPort. The project will improve connectivity, efficiency, and disaster resilience of the transportation \nnetwork in Solomon Islands. \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n3.  Solomon Islands is an archipelago of more than 900 islands and low-lying coral atolls with \na population of about 670,000. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes Solomon Islands \nas in a fragile and conflict-affected situation following the civil tensions from 1998 to 2003. \nSince the end of the tensions, Solomon Islands has been rebuilding its economy. From 2015 to \n2019, the country\u2019s average annual economic growth rate was 3.0%, driven by export of natural \nresources. Solomon Islands is highly prone to geophysical and climate hazards that will be \nexacerbated by climate change. About 85% of the population live in rural areas with limited access \nto market and basic services. \n \n4.  Sector road map. Recognizing these challenges, in April 2016, the government launched \nthe  National  Development  Strategy  (NDS),  2016\u20132035,  which  outlines  Solomon  Islands\u2019 \nsocioeconomic development framework.1 The NDS serves as the road map for the project. \nIt emphasizes the need to expand and maintain climate-resilient infrastructure to achieve inclusive \neconomic growth by increasing access to domestic and international markets.2 Under the NDS, \nat least 40% of the rural population should have access to essential services as a direct result of \ninfrastructure investment by 2035. \n \n5.  Transport infrastructure in Solomon Islands is inadequate and in a poor state of repair. \nAssets are deteriorating because of high exposure to geophysical and climate hazards, including \nearthquakes, landslides, flooding, and cyclones. The vulnerability of transport infrastructure to \ndisasters  significantly  complicates  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  a  multimodal  and \nintegrated transport network to boost the economy. \n \n6.  Only 67% of the country\u2019s 1,523 km road network is in maintainable condition, while the \nrest needs substantial rehabilitation to become maintainable. There are about 18,000 vehicles in \nSolomon Islands, of which 90% are in Guadalcanal Province.3 The country\u2019s main road, the east\u2013\nwest Guadalcanal corridor, is deteriorating. Critical urban road sections have capacity constraints \nleading to traffic congestion, and frequent floods occasionally wash away bridges and inundate \nsections of the road. This is particularly challenging for women and children who rely heavily on \n \n1  Government of Solomon Islands. 2016. National Development Strategy, 2016\u20132035. Honiara. \n2  In the NDS, the Solomon Islands commits to facilitate regional trade to promote inclusive economic growth. Solomon \nIslands is a member of the World Trade Organization, the Melanesian Free Trade Agreement, the intra-regional \nPacific  Islands  Countries  Trade  Agreement,  and  Pacific  Agreement  on  Closer  Economic  Relations  Plus. \nThe government is also an early adopter of approaches outlined in Pacific Ports 2030\u20132050, a vision of resilient, \ngreen, and clean ports in the Pacific. \n3  Annual average daily traffic is about 900 vehicles in rural areas and 9,000\u201338,000 in urban areas. \n ", "2 \nsafe pedestrian access for travel. Lack of maintenance and under-capacity of drainage systems \nalso contribute to widespread road deterioration. \n \n7.  Inadequate  maritime  facilities  aggravate  the  poor  safety  and  efficiency  of  shipping \nservices. Of the 91 domestic wharves, only 46 are in maintainable condition.4 At most islands, \nvessels have no choice but to offload passengers and cargoes onto small outboard motorboats \nfar from the shore. This practice is extremely risky for vulnerable passengers, such as people with \ndisabilities, pregnant women, and young children; and is particularly challenging in bad weather, \nespecially at sites exposed to strong trade winds. \n \n8.  The Honiara International Port handles about 90% of international cargo and has an \nannual  container  cargo  handling  volume  of  about  31,000  twenty-foot  equivalent  units. \nHowever, the old international wharf does not meet seismic standards. In the event of a significant \nseismic event, the wharf would sustain substantial damage, possibly beyond repair. Such an \nevent might also preclude it from being able to support post-disaster functions. \n \n9.  Policy framework and donor coordination. The government\u2019s National Transport Plan \n2017\u20132036 sets out guiding principles for priority investments in the transport sector and serves \nas the policy framework for the project.5 The government used multi-criteria analysis to prioritize \ninvestments  in  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  existing  road,  maritime,  and  aviation \ninfrastructure. \n \n10.  Solomon  Islands\u2019  road  and  maritime  sectors  face  challenges  including  in  asset \nmanagement  and  planning,  implementation  efficiency,  and  transport  safety,  which  the \ngovernment  is  addressing  through  various  development  partner-supported  initiatives. 6 \nThe Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) is responsible for planning, developing, and \nmanaging transport infrastructure including roads, bridges, and wharves. In 2009, the government \nestablished the National Transport Fund (NTF) under the MID to finance the development and \nmaintenance of transport assets. From 2016 to 2017, the NTF had difficulty fully implementing its \nwork programs. To address this challenge, the World Bank\u2019s ongoing Roads and Aviation Project \nis providing technical assistance to the NTF to build its capacity, particularly for long-term planning \nand  asset  management.  Transport  infrastructure  maintenance  practices  need  further \nimprovement. Road safety is a concern in central Honiara, which has the highest concentration \nof vehicles in the country. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-financed Kukum \nHighway Upgrade Project, completed in 2018, improved pedestrian walkways, road crossings, \nand a roundabout in Honiara. The planned second phase of the project is expected to further \nenhance road safety. In addition, the Word Bank\u2019s Global Road Safety Facility is preparing a road \nsafety management capacity review to help address road safety issues in Solomon Islands. \n \n11.  The Solomon Islands Maritime Authority (SIMA) oversees maritime safety regulation. \nThe state-owned enterprise, Solomon Islands Ports Authority, operates the ports in Honiara and \nNoro. The passage of the SIMA Act, 2018 by the National Parliament of Solomon Islands aims \nfor SIMA to become a self-funded organization to provide better service to the shipping industry \nand fulfill mandatory obligations under international maritime conventions. The Government of \nAustralia provides assistance through physical and nonphysical maritime sector investments, \nincluding ongoing support to operationalize the SIMA Act, and pursues reforms for existing \n \n4  Government of Solomon Islands, Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID), Central Project Implementation Unit. \n2017.

Strategic context. The government\u2019s initiative to strengthen transport connectivity is in \nline with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities.7 Investments in building a climate- and \ndisaster-resilient transport network will contribute to addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, making cities more livable, and fostering \nregional cooperation and integration.  ADB\u2019s support for the government\u2019s initiative will contribute \nto achieving the objectives of ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for 11 small Pacific island \ncountries, 2021\u20132023 by enhancing transport connectivity and efficiency and improving climate \nand disaster resilience.8 The project supports the implementation of climate- and disaster-resilient \ninfrastructure by incorporating designs that address the risk of earthquake and of flooding during \nheavy rainfall. Moreover, the project\u2019s emphasis of building a long-term partnership with the \ngovernment and improving domestic and regional connectivity through infrastructure investment \nis in line with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020.9 The project will also support improved \ntransport infrastructure maintenance practices and will contribute to strengthening the MID\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n13.  Pandemic  impacts.  The  ongoing  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has \nseverely impacted the Solomon Islands\u2019 economy. The economy is estimated to have contracted \nby 4.5% in 2020, driven by disruptions to export markets, supply chains, and travel.10 In May \n2020, the government adopted the economic stimulus package of $37.5 million, 30% of which is \ncommitted to building infrastructure programmed under the National Transport Plan, 2017\u2013\n2036.11 Rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure remains a national priority to help households \nand businesses continue to produce, trade, employ people, and boost aggregate demand in the \neconomy. Further, the need for infrastructure rehabilitation is crucial to sustain and quickly revive \nthe economy in the aftermath of COVID-19. \n \n14.  The project is equivalent to 11% of the country\u2019s gross national income. Supporting \ninfrastructure is highly beneficial because it provides employment, maintains economic activity, \nand contributes to unlocking the potential for more investments and growth in rural areas. The \nimpacts will be felt in the capital region and the agriculture hubs in the selected provinces. Cost \nestimates and implementation schedules have been updated to reflect the impacts of COVID-19. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  access  to  essential  services  and \nproductive resources and markets provided to all Solomon Islanders (footnote 1). The investment \nproject  will  have  the  following  outcome:  connectivity,  efficiency,  and  disaster  resilience  of \ntransportation network in Solomon Islands improved.12 \n \n7  ADB. 2018.

Output  1:  Road  transport  infrastructure  rehabilitated  and  climate  proofed. \nThe project will finance civil works to rehabilitate and upgrade about 35 km of road infrastructure \nalong the east\u2013west corridor. This comprises (i) rehabilitating the 1.7 km section of Mendana \nAvenue between Honiara City Council and Town Ground with asphalt concrete wearing course; \nand improving road safety by providing bus bays, parking, and footpaths; (ii) upgrading the 3.1 km \nroad section between Town Ground and White River from two lanes to four lanes with asphalt \nconcrete wearing course; and improving road safety through intersection treatments, provision of \nrefuge islands and footpaths, and improving traffic flows through the construction of bus bays; \nand (iii) rehabilitating the 31 km road section between Henderson and Mberande with double \nbituminous surface treatment; and inclusion of road safety furniture including guardrails, traffic-\ncalming measures, and speed signage in villages. Civil works will include post-construction \nperformance-based maintenance; climate proofing to future climate parameters; and gender-\nresponsive measures, which may include pedestrian footpaths, lighting, and concrete steps and \nwashing slabs. Gender-based violence (GBV) information and referral details will be posted in \nbus shelters and community areas in the project sites. \n \n17.  Output  2:  Maritime  transport  infrastructure  constructed  and  made  resilient  to \ndisaster risks. The project will finance civil works to construct two national priority provincial \nwharves at Ahanga in Rennell and Bellona Province; and Kira Kira, the capital of Makira-Ulawa \nProvince.  Rising  sea  levels  and  extreme  waves  are  the  main  threats  to  these  wharves. \nThe wharves will allow vessels to berth even in rough seas.13 Cargo will be able to be transferred \ndirectly from the vessels to the wharves. Civil works will include (i) construction of new piled \nreinforced concrete wharves and integrated small boat jetties to facilitate the efficient movement \nof passengers and freight on maritime transport; (ii) construction of new access roads to improve \nintermodal links to maritime transport in the target provinces; and (iii) construction of sheltered \nwaiting areas, spaces for women to market products, and separate ablution blocks for men and \nwomen.  \n \n18.  The project will also finance the reconstruction and improvement of the existing old wharf \nin Honiara International Port to make it more resilient to earthquakes.14 Although the existing \nwharf could be strengthened at a lower cost, in-situ geotechnical conditions would limit the \nadditional seismic resilience that such strengthening works could achieve. On this basis, it was \ndetermined that reconstructing part of the wharf using modern seismic codes would be a better \noption, with the significant added benefit that the wharf can also be raised to accommodate the \nprojected sea level rise during the design life of the structure. An extension of the wharf and \ndredging works will also ensure that the wharf will be able to receive more vessels, reduce ship \nwaiting times, and increase annual freight throughput. Ultimately, the project will contribute to \nreducing the cost of international trade. \n \n19.  Output 3: Institutional capacity strengthened. The project will support improvements \nin the transport infrastructure maintenance practices in Solomon Islands. It will assist the MID in \nplanning, project preparation, procurement, contract management, works supervision, asset \nmanagement  system  development,  and  long-term  transport  sector  institutional  reform. \nThe project will provide specific capacity strengthening for women in the MID. It will also help \n \n13 The new piled reinforced concrete wharf structures will be robust, with a deck level to account for cyclonic waves \nwith an average recurrence interval of 100 years. \n14 Part of the existing wharf will be demolished and completely reconstructed. \n ", "5 \nstrengthen the capacity of the Solomon Islands Ports Authority to meet international standards \nand procedures, and assess the port\u2019s opportunity to integrate into green port initiatives. \n \n20.  Past assistance. ADB has provided extensive support to the transport sector, beginning \nwith a $2.03 million loan approved in 1977 to extend the wharf in Honiara. This was followed by \na second phase to rehabilitate the original section of the wharf, which was completed in 1990. \nIn 1984, ADB approved a $1.81 million loan to improve and upgrade the road network in \nGuadalcanal. Following a period of civil unrest, ADB resumed support to the transport sector in \n2006, and has supported seven transport projects since then, including the ongoing Sustainable \nTransport Infrastructure Improvement Program approved in 2016.15 ADB has provided capacity \nstrengthening support in the transport sector through technical assistance since 2005 (footnote \n6).  \n \n21.  Lessons. Completed and ongoing ADB-funded projects have incurred significant start-up \ndelays pertaining to the preparation of detailed designs, scoping, and procurement activities. \nSuch delays have inadvertently affected the timely implementation of maintenance activities in \nthe country. In response to this finding, ADB approved the Transport Sector Project Development \nFacility to ensure design readiness by supporting the government in preparing engineering \ndesigns and assisting safeguards requirement activities, including the activities to be carried out \nunder the project.16 \n \n22.  The 2020 Annual Evaluation Review highlighted the need to ensure the sustainability of \nthe project outcome.17 In the transport context, this requires supporting adequate operation and \nmaintenance of infrastructure assets. The project will address sustainability issues through \nphysical  and  nonphysical  investments.  It  incorporates  a  new  contracting  initiative,  post-\nconstruction performance-based maintenance,18 and will review the MID\u2019s asset management \nsystem and recommend further enhancement to ensure sustainability during and after the project. \n \n23.  Disaster and climate risk assessment. A disaster and climate risk assessment prepared \nfor the project revealed that the most significant hazards to maritime infrastructure in Solomon \nIslands are earthquakes, extreme waves, and sea level rise. Earthquakes pose a high risk to the \nold wharf in Honiara Port, while extreme waves and sea level rise are more of a risk to the \nprovincial wharves. The design for the Honiara Port will consider raising the aprons to the required \nlevel to accommodate the predicted sea level rise over the design life of the project. \n \n24.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s engagement will add value by incorporating \ninternational best practices for transport investment projects, including introduction of post-\nconstruction performance-based maintenance and addressing climate change and disaster risks. \nThe project will complement the improvement works on the JICA-financed road sections of the \neast\u2013west Guadalcanal corridor; contribute to many network improvements made under other \n \n15 Project Performance under Past Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); and ADB. \n2016.

Use of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nachieve the outcome.19 An MFF is the preferred delivery modality as it allows early contracting of \nlong-term contracts and longer sector engagement, while financing is predictable and borrowing \ncan be spread over an extended time. The project will be financed by an MFF with three tranches \nadopting the time-slicing approach for large-scale stand-alone projects. Each tranche will finance \nslices of a group of contracts following the indicative tranche schedule, and the amount for each \ntranche will be requested according to the disbursement progress and projection. The MFF \nmodality enables ADB to support implementation of the NDS through a long-term partnership with \nSolomon Islands. \n \n26.  Scope of project 1. Tranche 1 will cover the entire project scope, financing the first slice \nof the works contract packages and consulting services. \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n27.  The investment project is estimated to cost $170.7 million, including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Climate  adaptation  is  estimated  to  cost  $2.74 million  under  the  investment  project. \nADB will finance 100% of adaptation costs under the MFF. Under output 2, the costs associated \nwith reconstructing and improving the old international wharf to meet modern seismic standards \nare estimated at $19.78 million.21 It is proposed that $13.60 million of this amount will be covered \nby the Asian Development Fund Disaster Risk Reduction financing for constructing a new section \nof the wharf. Details are in the facility administration manual (FAM).22 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.

Procurement  under  the  project  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB has agreed with the government to \njointly select consultants based on an agreed responsibility matrix to avoid start-up delays. ADB \nhas undertaken the detailed strategic procurement planning to choose the optimal procurement \narrangements. The project will achieve the best value for money by (i) using e-procurement to \nlower transaction costs and enhance process efficiency and transparency, (ii) attracting qualified \ncontractors for six works packages by conducting a pre-procurement workshop to get feedback \nfrom the market before finalizing the bidding documents, and (iii) recruiting qualified consulting \nfirms using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 for \nthree packages. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n33.  The engineering design was prepared to avoid or minimize land acquisition, social, and \nenvironmental impacts; consider road safety; and minimize climate change and disaster risks. \nIn addition, advance actions have been taken to ensure that construction can commence early. \nThese measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n \n34.  Climate and disaster risk assessments have been undertaken for the project roads, Ahanga \nand Kira Kira wharves, and Honiara Port. The assessments covered the findings of recent studies \non  seismic  risks  and  projections  of  accelerated  sea  level  rise  because  of  climate  change. \nThey determined the level of risk for the hazards, recommended adaptation measures that have \nbeen integrated into the design, and estimated the cost of the adaptation measures. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n35.  Economic and financial analyses concluded that the project is economically viable and \nfinancially sustainable. The economic analysis of the project follows ADB guidelines and compares \nlife cycle costs in with- and without-project scenarios using a 9% discount rate and the economic \ninternal rate of return as decision criteria.23 The project team evaluated all roads, and the wharves \n \n23 ADB. 2017.

The overall economic internal rate of return of the project is estimated to be 15.3%. \nThe sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the project. \n \n36.  A financial assessment was undertaken by the project team to examine the viability of the \nproject investment. The project\u2019s lending decision is based on economic viability rather than \nfinancial viability. Honiara International Port, the only revenue-generating component of the \nproject, is financially viable. Based on the financial sustainability assessment, the incremental \nrecurrent cost will be about 2% of the current recurrent budget allocation, and a commitment from \nthe government will ensure the project\u2019s sustainability. The incremental revenues generated by \nthe project during its first 25 years of operation will be sufficient to finance the project\u2019s recurrent \ncosts for Honiara Port. The pre-mitigation financial sustainability risk is substantial. The roads and \nprovincial wharves are nonrevenue earning, and will be constructed and maintained by the MID. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n37.  The financial management assessment concluded that the MID has adequate capacity to \nundertake the financial management of the project. The financial management risk is substantial, \nmainly because of the lack of internal audit function in the MID. The risk to financial management \nis mitigated by the fact that the MID has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB-\nfinanced projects. The project management unit (PMU) will  include a financial management \nspecialist. The PMU will establish and maintain separate records and accounts to track the financing \nresources received and the expenditures made for the project. The project will engage an internal \nauditor to review the internal process and an external auditor to conduct annual audits of the project \naccounts and related financial statements following international auditing standards. \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the FAM (footnote 22). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n39.  In 2020, the economy is projected to contract by 4.5% because of COVID-19 impacts, and \nthe proportion of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day is \nprojected to increase from 23.6% in 2018 to 27.5% in 2020.24 Unemployment, food insecurity, \nlimited access to basic social services and infrastructure, and a dearth of income opportunities \nare key poverty issues for the subproject communities, particularly in rural areas. Access to basic \nsocial services is limited because of the poor transport services and the high cost of urban living, \nwhich requires a regular cash income. The project will help reduce poverty by making land and \nmaritime transportation safer and more efficient, thereby expanding income opportunities for \nurban and rural project communities through better connectivity. Faster and easier travel will \nimprove access to schools, health centers, and markets. The civil works are also expected to \ncreate local jobs for men and women by outsourcing unskilled and semiskilled local labor or \nrelated services at construction sites. The PMU will report progress on safeguard activities in its \nquarterly progress reports and semiannual safeguards reports on overall project activities to ADB \nand the government. \n \n \n24 ADB. 2020.

Most project outputs include \ngender design features to ensure women\u2019s participation and access to project benefits. Key gender \nissues include safety concerns with land and maritime infrastructure such as lack of pedestrian \nfootpaths and lighting; limited income opportunities for women; low participation in decision-making; \na  high  prevalence  of  GBV;  and  human  trafficking,  particularly  forced  labor  and  prostitution. \nAccording to the World Vision Australia, 63% of men believe it is acceptable to hit women in certain \ncircumstances, 38% of women report their first sexual encounter as having been forced, and 2 out \nof 3 women have experienced physical violence from an intimate partner.25 The GAP focuses on \nincluding safe and gender-responsive design features in infrastructure and creating opportunities \nfor women\u2019s employment, particularly in nontraditional and skilled roles. In addition, actions are \nincluded to prevent and respond to GBV and human trafficking, including training of project staff \nand contractors, awareness raising within communities, and information dissemination on GBV \nservices. The project will engage a social development and gender specialist to assist the PMU in \nimplementing, monitoring, and reporting on the use of the ADB-provided GAP monitoring template \nand providing capacity-building activities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n41.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nof project 1 are as follows.26 \n \n42.  Environment (category B). The subprojects included in the first tranche are assessed \ncategory B for the environment. The MID prepared an environmental assessment and review \nframework, and three initial environmental examinations (IEEs). The impacts of works for each \ncomponent are site-specific, largely limited to the construction footprint, and can be mitigated and \nmanaged to acceptable levels provided the measures identified in the IEE and environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  are  implemented,  and  subsequently  monitored  and  reported. \nThe Environment and Conservation Division of the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, \nDisaster Management and Meteorology has adequate capacity to monitor the project with the \nPMU\u2019s support. The IEEs and EMPs will be reformatted as public environment reports and \nsubmitted to the Environment and Conservation Division as the basis of the application for \ndevelopment consent for the subprojects. The contractors will prepare their construction EMP \nbased on the project EMP and reflect their construction methodology and approach to the main \nconstruction elements, risk assessment, and mitigation measures.27 The PMU, with support from \nthe construction supervision consultant, will review and clear the  construction  EMP before \ncommencing any physical works, including site clearance. \n \n43.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  was  assessed  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement. The MID prepared a land acquisition resettlement framework, two \nresettlement  plans,  and  three  due  diligence  reports  (DDRs)  for  the  overall  project.  The \nresettlement framework will guide any further resettlement plans or DDRs required during project \nimplementation  and  for  any  unanticipated  impacts.  The  two  draft  resettlement  plans  were \nprepared for the upgrading of the road section between Town Ground and White River on \nGuadalcanal and for the construction of the Ahanga and Kira Kira wharves, which will require \nsome land acquisition and compensation for crops and trees.

The MID has prepared the three DDRs for the \nHoniara Port reconstruction and the rehabilitation of two road sections on Guadalcanal (Mendana \nAvenue and Henderson\u2013Mberande), indicating that all works will remain on existing footprints and \nrights-of-way. The construction supervision consultants will assist the PMU with the updating, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  the  management  of  any \nunanticipated impacts. \n \n44.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project was assessed category C for indigenous \npeoples. No impacts are expected on distinct and vulnerable groups of indigenous peoples as \ndefined under the Safeguard Policy Statement. The beneficiaries at the project sites are not \ndiscriminated upon because of their language, skin color, or traditional practices.
