Objectives  \n \n1.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  (Accountability  Mechanism)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has two  functions: problem-solving  and  compliance  review.  The \nAccountability Mechanism provides an independent and effective forum for people adversely \naffected  by  ADB-assisted  projects  to  (i)  voice  their  concerns  and  seek  solutions  to  their \nproblems, and (ii) request a review of the alleged ADB\u2019s noncompliance with its operational \npolicies and procedures that may have caused them, or is likely to cause them, direct and \nmaterial harm.   \n \nB.  Definitions \n \n2.  The following terms, as used in this section (Bank Policies and Operational Procedures), \nhave the following meaning: \n \n\u2015ADB-assisted project\u2016   A project financed or to be financed, or administered or to \nbe administered, by ADB, and covers both sovereign and \nnonsovereign operations. \n \n\u2015Board\u2016  ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \n \n\u2015borrower\u2016   When  applied  to  a  sovereign  operation,  means  the \nborrower of an ADB loan or the recipient of an ADB grant; \nand when applied to a nonsovereign operation, means the \nborrower, guarantee beneficiary, fund manager, investee, \nor similar entity to which ADB lends or guarantees, or in \nwhich it invests.  \n \n\u2015borrowing country\u2016   The country in which the ADB-assisted project is located. \n \n\u2015days\u2016         Unless specified otherwise, refers to working days in ADB. \n \n\u2015operations department\u2016   Any department that handles the formulation, processing, \nor  implementation  of  an  ADB-assisted  project.  The \noperations departments include the regional departments \nand the Private Sector Operations Department. \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/BP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 2 of 4 \n \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n BANK POLICIES (BP) \n \n \nC.  Guiding Principles   \n \n3.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  is  designed  to  (i)  increase  ADB's  development \neffectiveness and project quality; (ii) be responsive to the concerns of project-affected people \nand fair to all stakeholders; (iii) reflect the highest professional and technical standards in its \nstaffing and operations; (iv) be as independent and transparent as possible; (v) be cost-effective \nand efficient; and (vi) be complementary to the other supervision, audit, quality control, and \nevaluation systems at ADB.  \n \n4.  The Accountability  Mechanism  is a \u2015last resort\u2016 mechanism. ADB must continue to \nstrengthen its project design, implementation, and learning mechanisms to prevent problems \nand ensure compliance from the outset, and to deal with the legitimate concerns of project-\naffected people at the project and operational levels wherever possible.  \n \nD.  Structure  \n \n5.  The Accountability Mechanism has two functions. The problem solving function is led by \nthe Special Project Facilitator (SPF), who responds to problems of local people affected by \nADB-assisted projects through a range of informal and flexible methods. The compliance review \nfunction is led by the Compliance Review  Panel (CRP), which investigates alleged ADB\u2019s \nnoncompliance with its operational policies and procedures that has caused, or is likely to \ncause, direct and material harm to project-affected people.  \n \n6.  To provide an easily accessible single entry point for project-affected people, this two-\npronged  structure  is  supported  by  a  Complaint  Receiving  Officer  (CRO),  who  receives  all \ncomplaints from people seeking access to the Accountability Mechanism.  \n \nE.  Scope of Problem Solving  \n \n7.  The problem solving function assists people directly, materially, and adversely affected \nby  specific  problems  caused  by  ADB-assisted  projects  through  informal,  flexible,  and \nconsensus-based methods with the consent and participation of all parties concerned. The \nproblem solving function is outcome-driven. It does not focus on the identification and allocation \nof blame, but on finding ways to address the problems of the project-affected people. The SPF \nproblem solving function also aims to strengthen the internal problem solving processes of the \noperations departments. \n \n8.  The  scope  of  the  problem  solving  function  is  broader  than  the  compliance  review \nfunction. People who believe they have been or will be directly, materially, and adversely \naffected by an ADB-assisted project can use the problem solving function regardless of whether \nADB operational policies and procedures have been complied with. However, the problem \nsolving function is limited to ADB-related issues concerning ADB-assisted projects. \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/BP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 3 of 4 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n BANK POLICIES (BP) \n \n \n \nF.  Scope of Compliance Review  \n \n9.  Compliance Review Panel. The CRP is a fact-finding body on behalf of the Board. The \nCRP investigates alleged ADB\u2019s noncompliance with its operational policies and procedures in \nany ADB-assisted project in the course of the formulation, processing, or implementation of the \nproject that directly, materially, and adversely affects local people.  \n \n10.  The scope of compliance review is ADB's operational policies and procedures as they \nrelate to formulating, processing, or implementing an ADB-assisted project. The scope excludes \nmatters relating  to  the procurement  of goods and  services  (including  consulting  services), \ncorruption, and non-operational administrative matters, such as finance and administration. In \ncases where operational policies have been approved by the Board and have become effective \nbut have not been incorporated into the Operations Manual in a timely manner, or in cases \nwhere there is a conflict between a Board-approved policy and an Operations Manual section, \nthe Board-approved policies will be used for the purpose of the Accountability Mechanism. In \ncases where an Operations Manual section refers to another section that has been superseded, \nthe section that has superseded the cross-referenced section will prevail.1 \n \n11.  A compliance review does not investigate the borrowing country, the executing agency, \nor the private sector client. The conduct of these other parties is considered only to the extent \nthat  they  are  directly  relevant  to  an  assessment  of  ADB's  compliance  with  its  operational \npolicies and procedures. The compliance review does not provide judicial-type remedies, such \nas injunctions or monetary damages. Relative to a request for problem solving with the SPF, a \nrequest for compliance review is not an appeal to a higher authority. The SPF and CRP are of \nequal standing in the hierarchy of the Accountability Mechanism. \n \n12.  The CRP does not consider the policies and procedures of other institutions except to \nthe extent that ADB's policies and procedures have explicitly incorporated those of the other \ninstitutions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Sometimes an Operations Manual section has been updated or replaced, but other sections still refer to the old \nsection. Such references should be deemed to be references to the new Operations Manual section.

Introduction \n \n1.  This  Operations  Manual  section  describes  the  operational  procedures  of  the \nAccountability Mechanism policy (Accountability Mechanism) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the roles of the parties involved in its implementation.  \n \nB.   Appointment and Administrative Matters  \n \n2.  Problem Solving. The Special Project Facilitator (SPF) is appointed by the President \nafter consultation with the Board, and reports directly to the President. The SPF\u2019s term is for 3 \nyears and may be renewed for another 2 years. The SPF must not have worked in any ADB \noperations department for at least 5 years before the appointment. The SPF must disclose \nimmediately to the President any personal interest or significant prior involvement in a project \nthat  is subject to  problem  solving  procedures.  The  SPF  has  access to  all  ADB  staff  and \nManagement, and all ADB records that the SPF deems relevant, except personal information \nthat is typically restricted. The President evaluates the performance of the SPF. \n \n3.  The Office of the SPF (OSPF) supports the work of the SPF. The OSPF may engage \ntechnical experts as consultants to assist OSPF work, including monitoring activities.  \n  \n4.  Compliance Review Panel. The Compliance Review Panel (CRP) is a fact-finding body \non behalf of the Board. The CRP has three members, one of whom is the chair. The CRP chair \nserves full time and the other two members serve part time as and when required. CRP \nmembers are appointed by the Board upon the recommendation of the Board Compliance \nReview Committee (BCRC) in consultation with the President. The BCRC directs the search \nand selection process, which may involve the use of an executive search firm if necessary. \nBudget, Personnel and Management Systems Department (BPMSD), in coordination with the \nOffice of the Secretary (OSEC), handles the administrative processes.  \n \n5.  Each panel member has a 5-year, nonrenewable term. Two panel members are from \nregional member countries, with at least one from a developing member country (DMC). The \nthird panel member is from a nonregional member country.  \n \n6.  Directors, alternate directors, directors\u2019 advisors, Management, staff, and consultants are \nineligible to serve on the CRP until at least 3 years have elapsed from their time of service with \nADB. After serving on the CRP, panel members are barred from any future employment at ADB, \nincluding engagement as consultants. A panel member may be removed by the Board upon the \nrecommendation  of  the  BCRC  and  in  consultation  with  the  President  on  the  grounds  of \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 2 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \ninefficiency and/or misconduct. A panel member will be disqualified from participating in a \ncompliance review if he or she has a personal interest or has had significant prior involvement in \nthe project under review. A panel member must disclose immediately to the BCRC any personal \ninterest or significant prior involvement in a project subject to compliance review. \n \n7.  The  CRP  may  engage  technical  experts  as  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  assist  in  its  work,  including  post-compliance  review \nmonitoring. The CRP has access to all ADB staff and Management, and all ADB records that it \ndeems relevant, except personal information that is typically restricted.  \n \n8.  Office of the Compliance Review Panel. The Office of the Compliance Review Panel \n(OCRP) supports the CRP. OCRP staff are ADB staff but report to the CRP chair. The terms \nand conditions of their employment are determined the same way as for other ADB staff. OCRP \nstaff can be transferred to and from other parts of ADB. BPMSD handles the administrative \nprocesses in relation to OCRP staff in accordance with ADB guidelines. \n \n9.  The CRP chair is responsible for preparing the combined annual work plan and budget \nof the CRP and OCRP, with due regard to principles of efficiency and cost effectiveness. The \nannual work plan and budget is endorsed by the BCRC in consultation with the President and \nreviewed by the Board\u2019s Budget Review Committee. The work plan and budget proposal is then \npresented to the Board for approval, separately from ADB\u2019s overall administrative budget. The \nBCRC chair, in consultation with other BCRC members, provides written feedback annually on \nthe performance of the CRP members.  \n \n10.  Complaint  Receiving  Officer.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  jointly  engage  a  Complaint \nReceiving Officer (CRO) from outside ADB, in a way similar to the engagement of the executive \nsecretary of ADB\u2019s Administrative Tribunal. The CRO is engaged on a full-time basis to respond \npromptly to complainants. The CRO reports to the SPF and the CRP chair. The CRO has \naccess to the OSPF, OCRP, and operations departments regarding the status and processing \nof complaints. \n \n11.  Board Compliance Review Committee. The BCRC consists of six Board members, \nincluding four regional members (at least three of whom must be from borrowing countries) and \ntwo nonregional members. The BCRC members are appointed in accordance with the Board's \nRules of Procedure. OSEC provides support to the BCRC.  \n \nC.  Roles and Activities  \n \n1.  Complaint Receiving Officer  \n \n12.  The CRO  \n(i)  receives  all  complaints  from  people  seeking  access  to  the  Accountability \nMechanism and promptly acknowledges them; \n(ii)  registers the complaints;  \n(iii)  informs the complainants about whom to contact after complaints have been \nregistered;  \n(iv)  forwards complaints to either the SPF or the CRP chair, as requested by the \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 3 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \ncomplainants;  or  forwards  complaints  that  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the \nAccountability Mechanism, such as those relating to procurement or corruption, \nto other relevant departments and offices;  \n(v)  copies the SPF, CRP, and operations department concerned if the complaints \nare not forwarded to them, ensuring the complainants\u2019 identities are not revealed \nto parties other than the SPF and the CRP; \n(vi)  provides information to complainants;  \n(vii)  maintains  the  landing  page  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism  website  within \nADB\u2019s public website, as directed by the OSPF and OCRP, and working with the \nDepartment of External Relations (DER); and \n(viii)  undertakes other work as assigned by the SPF and CRP chair. \n \n13.  The CRO carries out all functions with objectivity and neutrality. \n  \n2.  Office of the Special Project Facilitator  \n \n14.  The OSPF1  \n(i)  processes complaints requesting problem solving;  \n(ii)  obtains from the operations departments all materials relating to the complaints; \n(iii)  engages with all relevant parties, including the complainants, the borrower, the \nBoard member representing the borrowing country, Management, and staff to \ngain a thorough understanding of the issues to be examined during problem \nsolving; \n(iv)  facilitates consultative dialogue, promotes information sharing, undertakes joint \nfact-finding,2 and/or facilitates the establishment of a mediation mechanism;  \n(v)  informs the Board and other stakeholders about the results of problem solving \nactivities;  \n(vi)  monitors the implementation of the remedial actions agreed upon during the \nproblem solving process; \n(vii)  collates and integrates internal and external experiences with problem solving to \nbe fed back into ADB's operations, including the formulation, processing, and \nimplementation of projects; \n(viii)  provides generic support and advice to operations departments in their problem \nprevention and problem solving activities, but not for specific problems that the \noperations departments are working to resolve; \n(ix)  works  with  the  OCRP  to  produce  a  clear,  simple,  informative,  and  succinct \ninformation packet about the Accountability Mechanism, highlighting the different \nprocesses and remedies available under the two functions;  \n(x)  prepares and publishes Accountability Mechanism annual reports jointly with the \nOCRP;  \n                                                 \n1  In carrying out the problem solving and other related functions, the SPF, as the head of the OSPF, decides which \nactivities will be performed by the SPF and which by the OSPF staff.  \n2  Joint fact-finding can be undertaken with parties that the SPF deems relevant, including the complainants, the \noperations department concerned, and the borrower.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 4 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n(xi)  produces a learning report every 3 years through joint efforts with the OCRP, the \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED), and the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD);  \n(xii)  raises awareness within ADB and through outreach activities with the public that \ninclude a holistic introduction to the Accountability Mechanism while focusing on \nspecific subjects; \n(xiii)  works with the CRO, OCRP, and DER to maintain a common ADB Accountability \nMechanism website within ADB\u2019s public website to provide information on both \nthe problem solving and compliance review functions;  \n(xiv)  conducts  other  activities  required  to  carry  out  the  problem  solving  function \neffectively and efficiently; and \n(xv)  liaises with accountability mechanisms at other institutions. \n \n15.  The OSPF problem solving function does not replace the project administration and \nproblem solving functions of the operations departments, which are an inherent part of their \nwork. Operations departments have the initial responsibility for responding to the concerns of \naffected people. However, the OSPF, in consultation with the operations departments, carries \nout activities designed to improve the internal problem solving capacity of ADB.3  \n \n16.  The SPF\u2019s role is confined to ADB-related issues on ADB-assisted projects. The SPF \ndoes not interfere in the internal matters of any DMC and does not mediate between the \ncomplainants and local authorities. \n \n3.    Compliance Review Bodies  \n \n17.  The CRP  \n(i)  processes complaints requesting compliance review;  \n(ii)  engages with all relevant parties and stakeholders, including the complainants, \nthe  borrower,  the  Board  member  representing  the  borrowing  country, \nManagement, and staff to gain a thorough understanding of the issues to be \nexamined during the compliance review; \n(iii)  coordinates its activities, to the extent appropriate, with those of the compliance \nreview  mechanism  of  any  other  cofinancing  institution  that  is  conducting  a \nseparate compliance review of the same project; \n(iv)  conducts  thorough  and  objective  reviews  of  compliance  by  ADB  with  its \noperational policies and procedures; \n(v)  engages all stakeholders concerned throughout the compliance review process; \n(vi)  consults with the complainants, the borrower, the Board member representing \nthe borrowing country, Management, and staff on its preliminary findings; and \naddresses any resulting comments; \n(vii)  issues draft reports which will be sent to the complainants, the borrower, the \nBCRC, Management, and the operations department concerned; \n(viii)  completes the compliance review even if the borrowing country refuses to grant a \nsite visit; \n                                                 \n3   Since 2004, the OSPF has been proactive in improving the internal problem solving capacity of ADB. The OSPF \nhas provided training to staff, designed complaint tracking systems, developed and disseminated problem solving \ngood practices, and carried out other related activities.  \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 5 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n(ix)  issues its final compliance review report to the Board; \n(x)  provides  comments  on  Management\u2019s  proposed  remedial  actions  to  bring  a \nproject into compliance; \n(xi)  monitors the  implementation  of  decisions  made  by  the  Board  and  produces \nannual monitoring reports; \n(xii)  prepares and publishes Accountability Mechanism annual reports jointly with the \nOSPF;  \n(xiii)  produces a learning report every 3 years through joint efforts with the OSPF, \nIED, and RSDD; \n(xiv)  develops a roster of independent technical experts who can assist the CRP in \ncarrying out its work; and \n(xv)  liaises with accountability mechanisms at other institutions. \n \n18.  The CRP chair  \n(i)  ensures all the functions listed for the CRP are carried out; \n(ii)  serves as the head of the OCRP and has full responsibility for running the \nOCRP; \n(iii)  manages the OCRP as an effective, efficient, and independent office, including \nmanaging the OCRP\u2019s personnel, budget, and work program under the oversight \nof the BCRC, and in accordance with ADB rules and procedures; \n(iv)  assigns member(s) of the CRP to conduct compliance review and monitoring \ntasks in consultation with the BCRC; \n(v)  provides regular (e.g., quarterly) briefings to the BCRC, one of which may be \ncombined with the briefing on the Accountability Mechanism annual report;  \n(vi)  prepares the annual work program and budget for the CRP and OCRP; \n(vii)  engages  stakeholders  in  the  compliance  review  process  and  ensures  that \ncompliance review results are communicated to them and the public; \n(viii)  ensures  high-quality  professional  work  and sets quality  standards for  OCRP \noutputs; \n(ix)  formulates and implements the OCRP\u2019s work program as approved by the Board, \nand reports to the Board through the BCRC on the activities of the CRP and \nOCRP; and \n(x)  provides input to the BCRC\u2019s annual performance feedback on the other CRP \nmembers.  \n \n19.  The OCRP  \n(i)  supports the work of the CRP; \n(ii)  works  with  the  OSPF  to  produce  a  clear,  simple,  informative,  and  succinct \ninformation packet about the Accountability Mechanism, highlighting the different \nprocesses and remedies available under the two functions;   \n(iii)  raises awareness in ADB and through public outreach activities that include a \nholistic introduction to the Accountability Mechanism while focusing on specific \nsubjects; \n(iv)  in  coordination  with  the  OSPF,  operations  departments,  the  NGO  and  Civil \nSociety  Center,  and  DER,  ensures  that  such  information  dissemination  and \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 6 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \npublic outreach is integrated with ADB's activities to promote interaction with \nproject beneficiaries and stakeholders, including civil society organizations;  \n(v)  works with the CRO, OSPF, and DER to maintain a common ADB Accountability \nMechanism website within ADB\u2019s public website to provide information on both \nthe problem solving and compliance review functions; and  \n(vi)  facilitates  the  CRP\u2019s  communication  and  coordination  with  the  Board, \nManagement, the OSPF, and staff.  \n \n20.  The BCRC   \n(i)  clears  the  CRP's  proposed  terms  of  reference  (TOR) for  compliance  review \nbefore it is released by the CRP;  \n(ii)  reviews the CRP\u2019s draft compliance review reports; \n(iii)  reviews the CRP's draft reports on monitoring implementation of remedial actions \napproved by the Board as a result of a compliance review before the CRP \nfinalizes them;  \n(iv)  decides and adjusts the CRP monitoring time frames; \n(v)  reviews and endorses the combined CRP and OCRP annual work plan and \nbudget; \n(vi)  searches for CRP members in consultation with the President;  \n(vii)  provides annual written feedback to all CRP members on their performance;   \n(viii)  in case of a borrowing country\u2019s rejection of a CRP site visit, dialogues with \nManagement on the reasons for the borrowing country\u2019s refusal; and \n(ix)  serves as the focal point for the CRP\u2019s communication and dialogue with the \nBoard on the Accountability Mechanism.  \n \n21.  The BCRC's function in clearing the proposed TOR and reviewing the draft compliance \nreview reports is to ensure that the CRP operates within the scope of the compliance review \nfunction as set out in the Accountability Mechanism. The BCRC reviews the CRP's monitoring \nreports  to  ensure  that  the  CRP  has  carried  out  a  satisfactory  process  in  monitoring  the \nimplementation of any remedial actions approved by the Board following the compliance review. \n \nD.

For both the problem solving and compliance review functions, complaints may be filed \nby (i) any group of two or more people in a borrowing country where the ADB-assisted project is \nlocated or in a member country adjacent to the borrowing country who are directly, materially, \nand adversely affected; (ii) a local representative of the affected persons; or (iii) a nonlocal \nrepresentative of the affected persons, in exceptional cases where local representation cannot \nbe found and the SPF or CRP agrees. A complaint made through a representative must clearly \nidentify  the  project-affected  people  on  whose  behalf  the  complaint  is  made  and  provide \nevidence of the representative\u2019s authority to represent such people.  \n \n27.  For a compliance review, complaints may also be filed by any one or more ADB Board \nmembers,  after  first  raising  their  concerns  with  Management,  in  special  cases  involving \nallegations of serious violations of ADB's operational policies and procedures relating to an \nongoing ADB-assisted project. These alleged violations must have, or are likely to have, a \ndirect, material, and adverse effect on a community or other group of individuals residing in the \nborrowing country or in a member country adjacent to the borrowing country. The conduct of the \ncompliance review requested by a Board member does not affect or limit the existing rights of \nBoard members to request or initiate reviews of ADB policies and procedures. \n \n28.  Compliance reviews cover only ADB-assisted projects.7 The filing of a complaint to either \nthe  SPF  or  CRP  does  not  suspend  or  otherwise  affect  the  formulation,  processing,  or \nimplementation of the project unless agreed to by the borrower concerned and ADB. \n \n2.  Scope \n \n29.  Problem Solving Function. The problem solving function is outcome-driven, focusing \nnot on the identification and allocation of blame, but on finding ways to address the problems of \nthe people affected by ADB-assisted projects. The scope of the problem solving function is \nbroader than the compliance review function. People who believe they have been or will be \ndirectly, materially, and adversely affected by an ADB-assisted project can use the problem \nsolving function regardless of whether ADB operational policies and procedures have been \ncomplied  with.  However,  the  problem  solving  function  is  limited  to  ADB-related  issues \nconcerning ADB-assisted projects.  \n \n30.  Compliance Review Function. The CRP examines whether the direct and material \nharm alleged by the complainants is the result of ADB's failure to follow its operational policies \nand  procedures  in  the course of formulating, processing, or implementing an ADB-assisted \nproject. The scope of compliance review is ADB's operational policies and procedures as they \nrelate to formulating, processing, or implementing an ADB-assisted project. The applicable \noperational policies and procedures depend on whether the complaint concerns a proposed or \n                                                 \n7   Since ADB cannot control the actions of third parties with respect to associated facilities which are not funded by \nADB, such associated facilities are not covered by the Accountability Mechanism. \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 9 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nan ongoing project.8 For a proposed project, the applicable policies and procedures are those in \neffect when the complaint is filed with the CRP. For an ongoing project, the applicable policies \nand procedures are those in effect at the time of the Board or President\u2019s approval of the \nproject, unless otherwise specified in the relevant policies, procedures, or project documents.  \n \n31.  The Board decides whether a policy is an operational policy subject to compliance \nreview,9 and the CRP determines which part, if any, of the operational policies and procedures \nwas or is not complied with after carrying out a compliance review. ADB\u2019s operational policies \nand  procedures  subject  to  compliance  review  do  not  include  guidelines  and/or  similar \ndocuments or statements. The CRP does not consider the policies and procedures of other \ninstitutions except to the extent that ADB's policies and procedures have explicitly incorporated \nthose of the other institutions. \n \n32.  To determine noncompliance, the CRP must be satisfied that there is evidence of (i) \ndirect and material harm that has been caused by the ADB-assisted project; (ii) noncompliance \nof ADB with its operational policies and procedures; and (iii) the noncompliance as a cause for \nsuch harm.  \n \n3.  Exclusions \n \n33.  Complaints are excluded from both problem solving and compliance review functions if \nthey are \n(i)  about actions that are not related to ADB's actions or omissions in the course of \nformulating, processing, or implementing ADB-assisted projects; \n(ii)  about matters that complainants have not made good faith efforts to address with \nthe operations department concerned; \n(iii)  about an ADB-assisted project for which 2 years or more have passed since the \nloan or grant closing date;10 \n(iv)  frivolous, malicious, trivial, or generated to gain competitive advantage; \n(v)  about decisions made by ADB, the borrower or executing agency, or the private \nsector client on the procurement of goods and services, including consulting \nservices; \n(vi)  about  allegations  of  fraud  or  corruption  in  ADB-assisted  projects  and/or \nmisconduct by ADB staff; \n(vii)  about the adequacy or suitability of ADB's existing policies and procedures; \n                                                 \n8  A proposed project is a project that is being prepared and has not yet been approved by the Board or the President \n(as delegated by the Board). An ongoing project is a project that has been approved by the Board or the President. \n9  Whether a policy is subject to the Accountability Mechanism is generally indicated in the policy when it is submitted \nto the Board for its consideration. The Operations Manual clearly indicates whether a specific section is subject to \ncompliance review.  \n10 For programmatic operations, such as multitranche financing facilities, additional financing, and single-tranche \npolicy loans under one program, the cutoff is tranche- (or its equivalent) based. For projects whose loan or grant \nclosing dates are extended after project completion for purposes such as capitalizing interest payments and \nliquidation or for which the loan or grant closing date is not relevant, the cutoff date is 2 years after the project \ncompletion date. In the case of nonsovereign projects for which the loan or grant closing date is not relevant, the \ncutoff date is 2 years after the project is physically completed or, where physical completion is waived or is not \nrelevant (e.g., financial intermediation projects), 1 year after the date of the final disbursement or termination of \nADB's involvement in the project, whichever occurs earlier. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 10 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n(viii)  within  the  jurisdiction  of  ADB's  Appeals  Committee  or  ADB's  Administrative \nTribunal, or relate to ADB personnel matters; and/or \n(ix)  about  ADB's  non-operational  administrative  matters,  such  as  finance  and \nadministration. \n \n34.  The problem solving function also excludes  \n(i)  matters already considered by the OSPF, unless the complainants have new \nevidence previously not available to them or the subsequent complaint can be \nreadily consolidated with the earlier complaint; in such cases, any resubmission \nor consolidation of a complaint, as the case may be, should occur within 2 years \nafter the loan or grant closing  date; and/or  \n(ii)  matters that are being dealt with, or have already been dealt with, by the CRP \n(including those that have completed the compliance review process), except \nthose complaints considered ineligible for compliance review by the CRP. The \nrequest for problem solving after the CRP has found the complaint ineligible for \ncompliance review must take place within 2 years after the loan or grant closing \ndate.11  \n \n35.  The compliance review function also excludes complaints that \n(i)  relate to actions that are the responsibility of other parties, such as a borrower, \nexecuting agency, or potential borrower, unless the conduct of these other parties \nis directly relevant to an assessment of ADB's compliance with its operational \npolicies and procedures;  \n(ii)  do not involve ADB\u2019s noncompliance with its operational policies and procedures;  \n(iii)  are being dealt with by the OSPF up to the completion of step 3 under the \nproblem solving function; \n(iv)  relate to the laws, policies, and regulations of the borrowing country, unless they \ndirectly relate to ADB's compliance with its operational policies and procedures; \nand/or \n(v)  are about matters already considered by the CRP, unless the complainants have \nnew evidence previously not available to them and the subsequent complaint can \nbe  readily  consolidated  with  the  earlier  complaint.  In  such  cases,  any \nresubmission or consolidation of a complaint, as the case may be, should occur \nwithin 2 years after the loan or grant closing date. \n \n36.  Complainants  are  encouraged  to  first  address  their  problems  using  project-level \ngrievance redress mechanisms to facilitate prompt problem solving on the ground. However, \nthis is not a precondition for their access to the Accountability Mechanism. \n \nF.  How to File a Complaint  \n \n37.  Complaints from people seeking access to the Accountability Mechanism must be in \nwriting and preferably addressed to the CRO. Complaints may be submitted by mail, facsimile, \ne-mail, or hand delivery to the CRO at ADB headquarters. Complaints are also accepted by any \nADB office, such as a resident mission or representative office, which will forward them to the \nCRO. The working language of the Accountability Mechanism is English, but complaints may be \n                                                 \n11 All complaints to the SPF or CRP must be filed within 2 years after the loan or grant closing date..  \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 11 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nsubmitted in any of the official or national languages of ADB's DMCs. In cases where the \ncomplaints  are  submitted  in  languages  other  than  English,  additional  time  is  required  for \ntranslation. The identities of complainants are kept confidential unless the complainants agree \nto  disclose  their  identities,  but  anonymous  complaints  are  not  accepted.  The  identities  of \nrepresentatives who are not at the same time complainants are not kept confidential, but are \ndisclosed to ensure transparency.  \n \n38.  The complaint must specify the following: \n(i)  names,  addresses,  and  contact  information  of  the  complainants  and  their \nrepresentative(s); \n(ii)  if a complaint is made through a representative, the names of the project-affected \npeople on whose behalf the complaint is made and evidence of the authority to \nrepresent them; \n(iii)  whether the complainants choose to keep their identities confidential;  \n(iv)  whether the complainants choose to undergo problem solving with the OSPF or \ncompliance review with the CRP; \n(v)  a brief description of the ADB-assisted project, including its name and location; \n(vi)  a description of the direct and material harm that has been, or is likely to be, \ncaused to the complainants by the ADB-assisted project;  \n(vii)  a description of the complainants\u2019 good faith efforts to address the problems first \nwith the operations department concerned, and the results of these efforts; and \n(viii)  if applicable, a description of the complainants\u2019 efforts to address the complaint \nwith the OSPF, and the results of these efforts. \n \n39.  Complaints may also include the following information: \n(i)  an  explanation  of the complainants\u2019  claim that  the  direct  and  material  harm \nalleged  is,  or  will  be,  caused  by  the  alleged  failure  by  ADB  to  follow  its \noperational policies and procedures in the course of formulating, processing, or \nimplementing the ADB-assisted project; \n(ii)  a description of the operational policies and procedures that have not been \ncomplied with by ADB in the course of formulating, processing, or implementing \nthe ADB-assisted project;  \n(iii)  a  description  of  the  complainants\u2019  efforts  to  address  the  problems  with  the \nproject-level grievance redress mechanisms concerned, and the results of these \nefforts; \n(iv)  the desired outcome or remedies that complainants believe ADB should provide  \nthrough the Accountability Mechanism; and  \n(v)  any other relevant matters or facts with supporting documents. \n \n40.  A template for filing complaints will be posted on the ADB website.  \n \nG.  Processing Complaints  \n \n41.  The complainants decide and indicate in the complaint whether they want to initiate \nproblem solving or compliance review. They can exit or disengage from the problem solving \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 12 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nprocess at any time, which will terminate the process.12 After exiting or disengaging from the \nproblem solving process, the complainants may request the CRO to forward the complaint to \nthe CRP for compliance review. To meet the cutoff date for compliance review, such a request \nmust be made within 2 years of the loan or grant closing date.  \n \n42.  Complainants can also request compliance review upon completion of step 3 of the \nproblem solving process if they have serious concerns about compliance issues. In that case, \ncompliance review of the complaint, if found eligible, is carried out in parallel with step 4 of the \nproblem solving process.  \n \n43.  Complainants can also exit or disengage from the compliance review process at any \ntime, which will terminate the process. However, unless the complaint is found ineligible by the \nCRP, they cannot switch from compliance review to problem solving regardless of whether the \ncompliance review was completed. Complainants can provide additional information or evidence \non  the  complaint  during  the  problem  solving  or  compliance  review  processes.  However, \ncomplaints about different issues are considered new complaints.  \n \n44.  The  SPF  and  CRP  determine  independently  whether  the  complaint  meets  their \nrespective eligibility criteria. The SPF and CRP fully share information and analysis with each \nother on the complaint.   \n \n45.  The complaint processes are described in paras. 46\u201387.  \n \n1.  Receiving Complaints  \n \n46.  Step  1:  Receiving  and  registering  a  complaint.  The  complainants  or  their \nrepresentative(s)  file  a  complaint  with  the  CRO.  Complaints  received  by  any  other  ADB \ndepartments  or  offices  from  people  seeking  to  access  the  Accountability  Mechanism  are \nforwarded  to  the  CRO.  The  CRO  informs  the  SPF,  the  CRP  chair,  and  the  operations \ndepartment concerned about the complaint within 2 days of receiving it, attaching a copy of the \ncomplaint  letter.  Unless  the  complainants  have  clearly  indicated  that  confidentiality  is  not \nrequired, the CRO takes necessary measures when copying or forwarding the information to \nensure the confidentiality of the complainants\u2019 identities (for example, by masking the names of \nthe complainants). The CRO also stresses to all parties concerned within ADB the importance \nof ensuring the confidentiality requested by complainants. The CRO registers the complaint on \nthe Accountability Mechanism website within 2 days of receiving it. This is an administrative \nstep and does not mean the complaint is eligible for problem solving or compliance review. \n \n47.  Step 2: Acknowledging the complaint. Within 2 days of receiving the complaint, the \nCRO  acknowledges  receipt  of  the  complaint  and  sends  an  Accountability  Mechanism \ninformation packet to the complainants. The information packet indicates that the complainants \ncan  choose  to  undertake  either  problem  solving  or  compliance  review.  It  highlights  the \ndifferences between the two functions, explaining that the problem solving function addresses \nproblems on the ground and facilitates their resolution, while the compliance review function \nreviews ADB\u2019s compliance with its operational policies and procedures. The resulting remedies \n                                                 \n12  Exiting from the process occurs when the complainants make it known that they do not want to pursue the process \nany further. Disengagement occurs when the complainants no longer respond. \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 13 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n(if any) to bring a project into compliance may or may not mitigate any harm. The information \npacket also explains the procedural differences between the two functions. \n \n48.  If the complainants\u2019 choice for either problem solving or compliance review is clearly \nindicated in the complaint letter, the CRO informs them that they can change their choice within \n21 calendar days from the date of the CRO\u2019s acknowledgement letter. If the complainants\u2019 \nchoice is not clearly indicated in the complaint letter, the CRO asks them to clarify their choice \nwithin 21 calendar days from the date of the CRO\u2019s acknowledgement letter.   \n \n49.  Step 3: Forwarding the complaint. Within 5 days after the CRO\u2019s deadline for the \ncomplainants to notify the CRO of any change in their choice, the CRO decides whether to \nforward the complaint to \n(i)  the SPF if the complainants indicated a choice for problem solving; or \n(ii)  the CRP chair if the complainants indicated a choice for compliance review; or \n(iii)  other relevant departments and/or offices as appropriate if the complaint falls \noutside  the  mandate  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism,  such  as  a  complaint \nconcerning  procurement  or  corruption,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ADB \npolicy or procedure. \n \n50.  The  CRO  informs  relevant  parties  within  ADB\u2014including  the  SPF,  CRP  chair,  the \noperations department, and any other departments or offices\u2014about its decision on where to \nforward the complaint, explaining the basis for the decision. The CRO gives the relevant parties \n3 days to raise any objections and concerns regarding his/her decision. The relevant parties \nmay only object to the CRO\u2019s decision if they find that the complainants\u2019 choice has not been \nproperly reflected in the decision. If there is no objection, the CRO forwards the complaint to the \nrelevant party and copies other relevant parties.  \n \n51.  If the complainants have not clearly indicated a choice for problem solving or compliance \nreview, or if any party in ADB objects to the CRO\u2019s decision regarding where to forward the \ncomplaint, the CRO returns the complaint to the complainants and seeks their clarification. In \nsuch  a  case,  the  CRO  again  includes  the  information  packet  on  ADB\u2019s  Accountability \nMechanism. The CRO gives the complainants 60 calendar days from the date of the CRO\u2019s \nletter  to  respond.  If  the  complainants  do  not  respond  by  the  deadline,  the  Accountability \nMechanism process ends, and the CRO informs the complainants accordingly.  \n \n52.  Step 4: Informing the complainants. Within 2 days of forwarding the complaint to the \nrelevant party, the CRO notifies the complainants and their authorized representative(s) about \nwhich party will consider the complaint and the contact person(s) for the subsequent steps.  \n \n53.  Table A1.1 in Appendix 1 summarizes the complaint receiving process.  \n \n2.  The Problem Solving Function \n \n54.  The problem solving process takes about 180 days from the registration of the complaint \nto an agreement on remedial actions. This excludes translation time, any request for extension \nto provide information or file documents, and the time needed by the parties to facilitate the \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 14 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nresolution  of  their  problems.  The  OSPF  may  draw  on  the  project-level  grievance  redress \nmechanisms and/or the operations departments to resolve problems.  \n \n55.  Step 1: Determining eligibility. The SPF screens the complaint forwarded to him or her \nby the CRO13 and determines its eligibility within 21 days of receiving the complaint. To find a \ncomplaint eligible, the SPF must (i) be satisfied that the complaint meets all eligibility criteria for \nproblem solving; and (ii) believe, in his or her sole discretion, that the SPF\u2019s involvement could \nbe useful.   \n \n56.  In  determining  whether  the  complaint  is  eligible,  the  OSPF  reviews  whether  the \ncomplainants made prior good faith efforts to solve the problems with the operations department \nconcerned. The OSPF forwards the complaint to the operations department if the complainants \ndid not make such efforts. The OSPF consults and seeks information from relevant parties, such \nas the complainants, the borrower, and the operations department. The OSPF also ascertains \nwhether confidentiality has been requested by the complainants, including any representatives \nwho are at the same time also complainants, and takes the necessary actions. \n \n57.  The SPF reports the decision on eligibility to the President, with a copy to the vice-\npresident  concerned,  the  operations  department,  and  the  CRO.  The  SPF  informs  the \ncomplainants upon the determination of eligibility.  \n \n58.  Step 2: Review and assessment. If the complaint is eligible, the OSPF reviews and \nassesses  the  complaint  to  (i)  understand  the  history  of  the  complaint,  (ii)  confirm  the \nstakeholders, (iii) clarify the issues of concern and the options for resolving them, (iv) explore \nthe stakeholders' readiness for joint problem solving, and (v) recommend how the problems can \nbest be solved.  \n \n59.  The review may include site visits; interviews; and meetings with the complainants, the \nborrower, and any other people the OSPF believes would be helpful and beneficial. The OSPF \nobtains information from the operations department concerned and, if necessary, requests the \noperations department\u2019s advice and support. The OSPF conducts fact-finding missions on the \nSPF\u2019s own initiative; or participates, in consultation with the operations department, in special \nproject administration missions of the operations department.  \n \n60.  The OSPF completes the review and assessment, and the SPF reports the findings to \nthe President, with a copy to the vice-president concerned. The OSPF also sends the findings to \nthe  complainants,  the  borrower,  and  the  operations  department,  with  a  request  for  their \ncomments. Based on the assessment and taking into account the comments received, the SPF, \nsolely at his or her discretion, (i) decides whether to proceed with problem solving, or (ii) \ndetermines that no further problem solving efforts will be purposeful and concludes the process. \nThe OSPF is expected to take about 120 days from determination of eligibility to complete the \nreview and assessment. \n \n61.  Step 3: Problem solving. If problem solving proceeds, the OSPF assists the parties to \nengage in resolving the problems. The problem solving process depends on the circumstances. \n                                                 \n13  The forwarding of the complaint by the CRO to the SPF does not constitute a determination of the eligibility of the \ncomplaint.  \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 15 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nThe OSPF may facilitate a consultative dialogue, promote information sharing, undertake joint \nfact-finding, facilitate the establishment of a mediation mechanism, and/or use other approaches \nto problem solving. The time required for the problem solving varies depending on the nature, \ncomplexity, and scope of the problems.  \n \n62.  Implementing the problem solving process requires the consent of every party involved. \nExcept for the SPF, any party can walk away from the process if  it does not consider it \npurposeful or if there is no consensus. This would formally close the problem solving process. \n \n63.  Remedial  actions  that are  adopted  as  a result  of  the  problem solving  process  are \nreflected in a written agreement or series of agreements among the parties. Remedial actions \ninvolving a change in the project require approval according to ADB's applicable procedures \nand agreement by the borrower. \n \n64.  When the problem solving process has been completed (with or without any agreement), \nthe SPF submits a report to the President, with a copy to the vice-president and the  operations \ndepartment concerned, summarizing the complaint, steps to resolve the issues, decisions by the \nparties, and the agreement, if any, by the parties. The SPF issues this report and furnishes it to \nthe  complainants,  the  borrower,  the  CRP,  and  the  Board  for  information.  If  there  is  no \nagreement, the problem solving process ends upon completion of this step. \n \n65.  Upon submitting the report to the President (para. 64), with or without agreement, the \ncomplainants can also request the CRO to forward the complaint to the CRP for compliance \nreview  if  they  have  serious  concerns  on  compliance  issues,  to  be  carried  out  with  the \nimplementation and monitoring of the remedial actions reached at the problem solving stage, if \nany (step 4). To meet the time limit for eligibility for compliance review, the request to the CRO \nmust be made within the cutoff date of 2 years after the loan or grant closing date.  \n \n66.  Step 4: Implementation and monitoring. The relevant parties implement the agreed \nremedial  actions,  and  the  OSPF  monitors  their  implementation.  As  part  of  the  monitoring \nprocess,  the  OSPF  consults  with  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  and  the  operations \ndepartment. The monitoring time frame is project specific, depending on the implementation of \nthe remedial actions, but generally does not exceed 2 years. All stakeholders, including the \npublic, may submit information regarding the status of implementation to the OSPF.  \n \n67.  The OSPF prepares monitoring reports on the implementation of the remedial actions. \nThese reports are sent to the complainants, the borrower, and the operations department; and \nsubmitted to the President and copied to the Board for information. If the monitoring time frame \nexceeds 1 year, the OSPF produces annual monitoring reports. If the monitoring time frame is \nabout 1 year or less, the monitoring results may be included in the OSPF final report described \nin step 5. In monitoring the remedial actions, the OSPF produces either monitoring reports for a \nsingle complaint or combined monitoring reports for multiple complaints.14  \n \n \n                                                 \n14 In the case of combined monitoring reports, the complainants, the borrower, and the operations department will \nonly be sent the portion of the report about the complaints relevant to them. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 16 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n68.  Step 5: Conclusion of the problem solving process. When the monitoring has been \ncompleted, the OSPF prepares a final report and the SPF submits it to the President, the \ncomplainants, the borrower, the operations department, the CRP, the BCRC, and the Board for \ninformation. The OSPF produces either a final report for a single complaint or a combined final \nreport for multiple complaints (footnote 14).  \n \n69.  Table A1.2 in Appendix 1 summarizes the problem solving process.  \n \n3.  The Compliance Review Function  \n \n70.  The compliance review process is expected to take about 200 days from the registration \nof the complaint to the Board\u2019s consideration of the CRP final report, including about 70 days to \nBoard authorization of the compliance review. These periods exclude time for translation, any \nrequest for extension to provide information or file documents, and the time for conducting the \ncompliance review, which is not time-bound.  \n \n71.  Step  1:  Requesting  Management  response.  The  CRP  carries  out  an  initial \nassessment of the complaint forwarded by the CRO and determines within 5 days of receiving it \nwhether it falls within the mandate of the compliance review function. Upon determining this, \nthe CRP forwards the complaint to Management and requests a response within 21 days. In its \nresponse, Management should (i) provide evidence that ADB has complied with the relevant \nADB policies and procedures; or (ii) acknowledge that there have been failures in ADB\u2019s \ncompliance with its policies and procedures, and express its intention to take actions to ensure \ncompliance to the extent possible. Management response may also include other information \nthat Management deems relevant. The CRP copies the BCRC in its correspondence with \nManagement.  The  CRP  informs  the  borrower  and  the  Board  member  representing  the \nborrowing  country  about  receipt  of  the  complaint.  The  CRP  should  ascertain  whether \nconfidentiality is being requested by the complainants, including any representatives who are at \nthe same time also complainants, and take the necessary actions. \n \n72.  Step 2: Determining eligibility. Within 21 days of receiving Management\u2019s response, \nthe  CRP  determines  the  eligibility  of  the  complaint.15  The  CRP  reviews  the  complaint, \nManagement\u2019s response, and other relevant information. To find a complaint eligible, the CRP \nmust be satisfied that the complaint meets all eligibility criteria for compliance review. The CRP \nmust be satisfied that (i) there is evidence of noncompliance; (ii) there is evidence that the \nnoncompliance has caused, or is likely to cause, direct and material harm to project-affected \npeople; and (iii) the noncompliance is serious enough to warrant a compliance review. If the \nCRP finds that the alleged direct and material adverse effect is not totally or partially caused by \nADB\u2019s noncompliance, its eligibility determination states this without analyzing the direct and \nmaterial adverse effect itself or its causes. \n \n73.  As part of the eligibility determination, the CRP reviews and determines whether the \ncomplainants made prior good faith efforts to resolve issues with the operations department \nconcerned.  The  CRP  forwards  the  complaint  to  the  operations  department  if  there  is  no \nevidence that the complainants made such efforts.  \n                                                 \n15 The forwarding of the complaint by the CRO to the CRP does not constitute a determination of the eligibility of the \ncomplaint. \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 17 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n74.  The CRP informs the complainants, the borrower, the Board member representing the \nborrowing country, Management, and the operations department of its determination concerning \neligibility.  \n \n75.  Step 3: Board authorization of compliance review. The CRP submits its eligibility \nreport through the BCRC to the Board, attaching the complaint and Management\u2019s response. If \nthe CRP determines that the complaint is eligible, it recommends, that the Board authorize a \ncompliance review. Within 21 calendar days from receipt of the CRP's recommendation, the \nBoard decides\u2014on a no-objection basis and without making a judgment on the merits of the \ncomplaint\u2014whether to authorize the compliance review. Within 7 days from receipt of the \nBoard\u2019s authorization, the OCRP informs the complainants of the Board\u2019s decision.  \n \n76.  Step 4: Conducting compliance review. Within 10 days from the receipt of the Board\u2019s \nauthorization to conduct the compliance review, the BCRC clears the TOR for the compliance \nreview prepared by the CRP and the OCRP provides the TOR to the Board for information with \na copy to Management. The TOR includes the scope, methodology, estimated review time \nframe, budget, CRP member(s), and other necessary information for the compliance review. \nThe scope of the TOR is limited to the specific complaint. The TOR may also provide for a site \nvisit by the CRP. In that case, the TOR clearly explains why a site visit is necessary, what will \nbe reviewed, and how it will be conducted.  \n \n77.  The CRP begins the compliance review upon receiving the Board\u2019s authorization and the \nBCRC\u2019s clearance of the TOR. The time required for the CRP's review varies depending on the \nnature, complexity, and scope of the project and the alleged noncompliance. Throughout the \ncompliance review process, the CRP consults, as appropriate, all relevant parties, including the \ncomplainants,  the  borrower,  the  Board  member  representing  the  borrowing  country, \nManagement, and staff. These parties are given an opportunity to record their views, if any. The \ncompliance review may include desk reviews, meetings, discussions, and a site visit.  \n  \n78.  Step 5: Compliance Review Panel's draft report. Upon completion of its compliance \nreview, the CRP issues a draft report of its findings to the complainants, the borrower, and \nManagement for comments within 45 days. The CRP also forwards the draft report to the \nBCRC for its review. Each party is free to provide comments, but only the CRP's final view on \nthese matters is reflected in its final report. \n \n79.  The CRP compliance review report focuses on the specific complaint. It documents the \nCRP\u2019s findings concerning any noncompliance, and alleged direct and material harm. It includes \nall relevant facts needed to fully understand the context and basis for the CRP\u2019s findings and \nconclusions.  It focuses  on  whether  ADB failed  to  comply  with  its  operational  policies  and \nprocedures in formulating, processing, or implementing the project in relation to the alleged \ndirect and material harm. In case the CRP concludes there was noncompliance, it specifies the \nexact provisions in the relevant operational policies or procedures with which ADB failed to \ncomply. It also ascertains whether the alleged direct and material harm exists. If noncompliance \nis found and the alleged direct and material harm is confirmed, the report further focuses on \nestablishing whether the noncompliance was a cause of the alleged harm.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 18 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n80.  For assessing direct and material harm, the without-project situation is used as the base \ncase for  comparison,  based  on  available  information.  Non-accomplishments  and  unfulfilled \nexpectations that do not generate direct and material harm compared to the without-project \nsituation are excluded. If the CRP finds that the alleged direct and material adverse effect is not \ntotally or partially caused by ADB\u2019s noncompliance, its compliance review report states this \nwithout  analyzing  the  direct  and  material  adverse  effect  itself  or  its  causes.  Because  the \nassessment of direct and material harm in the context of the complex reality of a project can be \ndifficult, the CRP exercises careful judgment in these matters and is guided by ADB policies and \nprocedures where relevant.   \n \n81.  Step 6: Compliance Review Panel's final report. Within 14 days of receiving the \ncomments on its draft report from the complainants, the borrower, and Management, the CRP \nconsiders these comments and makes changes as necessary before issuing its final report to \nthe Board through the BCRC. The CRP\u2019s final report attaches a matrix of comments from the \ncomplainants, the borrower, and Management, and the CRP\u2019s response to such comments. The \nCRP's findings are reached by consensus among the panel members. In the absence of a \nconsensus, the majority and minority views are stated. \n \n82.  Step 7: Board consideration of the Compliance Review Panel\u2019s report. Within 21 \ncalendar days of receiving the CRP's final report, the Board considers the report. Within 7 days \nafter  the  Board\u2019s  consideration,  the  CRP's  final  report\u2014with  the  responses  from  the \ncomplainants, the borrower, and Management attached\u2014is released to the complainants and \nthe borrower. If the CRP concludes that there was no noncompliance by ADB, or that any \nnoncompliance  by  ADB  did  not  cause  direct  and  material  harm  to  the  complainants,  the \ncompliance review process ends upon completion of this step. \n \n83.  Step  8:  Management\u2019s  remedial  actions.  If  the  CRP  concludes  that  ADB\u2019s \nnoncompliance  caused  direct  and  material  harm,  Management  proposes  remedial  actions, \nwhich may include an action plan, to bring the project into compliance with ADB policies and \naddress related findings of harm. Because the legal ownership of the project lies with the \nborrower, which also has the principal responsibility for implementing the remedial actions, \nManagement must obtain the agreement of the borrower on the remedial actions. Management \nmay consult the CRP in developing the remedial actions. Management refers its draft remedial \nactions to the CRP and seeks its comments to be provided within 5 days. Upon receiving the \nCRP comments, Management submits a report on the proposed remedial actions to the Board, \nattaching the CRP comments. The report specifies the parties responsible for implementing the \nremedial actions, estimates of costs to implement the remedial actions, and parties to shoulder \nthe costs. The expected period of time between the Board\u2019s consideration of the CRP final \ncompliance review report and Management\u2019s submission of the proposed remedial actions to \nthe Board is 60 days.  \n \n84.  Step 9: Board\u2019s decision. The Board considers Management\u2019s proposed remedial \nactions within 21 calendar days of receiving them. The Board makes a decision regarding the \nremedial actions to bring the project into compliance and mitigate any harm, as appropriate. The \nBoard\u2019s decision, Management\u2019s remedial actions, and the CRP comments are released to the \ncomplainants and the borrower within 7 days after the Board\u2019s decision.  \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 19 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n85.  Step 10: Monitoring and conclusion. The CRP monitors implementation of remedial \nactions approved by the Board, if any. It reports to the Board concerning implementation of \nBoard decisions related to remedial measures, including its determination on the progress in \nbringing the project into compliance.  \n \n86.  Any remedial actions in relation to project scope or implementation approved by the \nBoard are carried out in accordance with applicable ADB policies and procedures. Unless the \nBoard specifies a different timetable, the CRP reports on the progress annually. The CRP chair, \nin consultation with the BCRC, determines which CRP member(s) will conduct the monitoring \nexercise  each  year.  The  monitoring  time  frame  is  project-specific,  depending  on  the \nimplementation  of the remedial  actions,  but generally  does  not  exceed  3  years. The final \nmonitoring report also concludes the compliance review process.  \n \n87.  The methodology for monitoring may include (i) consultations with the complainants, the \nborrower, the Board member concerned, Management, and staff; (ii) a review of documents; \nand (iii) site visits. The CRP also considers any information received from the complainants and \nthe public regarding the status of implementation. The CRP forwards its draft monitoring reports \nto the BCRC for review. It finalizes the reports in consultation with the BCRC before making them \navailable to the complainants, the borrower, the Board, Management, staff, and the public.  \n \n88.  Table A1.3 in Appendix 1 summarizes the compliance review process.  \n \n4.  Operations Departments\u2019 Handling and Tracking of Complaints  \n \n89.  Operations departments address problems or issues relating to complaints forwarded to \nthem by the OSPF or OCRP because the complainants did not make prior good faith efforts to \nsolve the problems or issues with the departments. Operations departments ascertain whether \nconfidentiality  is  being  requested  by  the  complainants  and  take  the  necessary  actions. \nOperations departments track the process and results in resolving the complaints forwarded to \nthem  by  the  OSPF  or  OCRP,  and  they  may  develop  a  tracking  system.16  Operations \ndepartments,  including  resident  missions,  are  encouraged  to  keep  records  of  meetings, \ncorrespondence, and other relevant information regarding complaints.  \n \n90.  At the end of the process of addressing the ineligible complaints  forwarded to the \noperations departments by the OSPF or OCRP, the operations department produces a report \nsummarizing the complaint, issues, actions taken to address the problems or issues, decisions \nor  agreements  by  parties  concerned,  results,  and  lessons.  This  report  is  posted  on  the \nAccountability Mechanism website within 14 days of its completion (para. 96). \n \n5.  Site Visits \n \n91.  Site  visits  should  be  a  routine  and  noncontroversial  aspect  of  the  Accountability \nMechanism. ADB adopts a partnership approach to help ensure that necessary site visits by the \n                                                 \n16  The OSPF developed a tracking system in 2009 in collaboration with the Office of Information Systems and \nTechnology and the India Resident Mission. Operations departments may draw from this and other existing \nsystems.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 20 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nCRP take place. Goodwill and collaboration between the CRP and the borrowing countries are \nnecessary.  Site  visits  will  take  place  in  consultation  with  the  borrowing  country  and  after \nobtaining the borrowing country\u2019s consent, for both sovereign and nonsovereign operations. \nADB expects borrowing countries to cooperate and allow site visits to take place. \n \n92.  The CRP is responsible for arranging site visits and ensuring the independence of the \nprocess. Management and staff, especially those in resident missions, will facilitate the CRP \nvisits  when  required  and  when  requested  by  the  CRP.  Resident  missions  may  assist  in \nobtaining  the  borrowing  country  government\u2019s  consent,  and  may  share  the  site  visit  and \ncompliance review TOR with the borrowing country government. The CRP is encouraged to \nseek the assistance of the ADB Board member representing the borrowing country and share \nthe TOR with the Board member before submitting a mission request to the DMC through the \nresident mission.  \n \n93.  If  a  site  visit  is  declined,  Management  will  discuss  with  the  borrowing  country  the \nreasons for not accepting the requested visit. In consultation with the BCRC and the borrowing \ncountry, Management will convey the reasons to the Board through an information paper.  \n \n94.  If a site visit is declined, the CRP will complete the compliance review and deliver its \nfindings and final views in its final report without a site visit. The CRP will use all available \ninformation,  and  may  make  appropriate  assumptions  and  draw  appropriate  inferences  in \ncompleting the compliance review. The CRP will present the best and most detailed analysis \npossible after exhausting the most cost-effective and logical alternative means to acquire the \nnecessary information. In the absence of a necessary site visit, the CRP may give added weight \nto the complainants\u2019 views.  \n \nG.  Transparency and Information Disclosure  \n \n95.  Information disclosure to the public is consistent with the fundamentals of the Public \nCommunications Policy (2011). A common ADB Accountability Mechanism website has been \nset up within the ADB website. The OSPF and OCRP have their own components within this \ncommon website. Any other information related to the Accountability Mechanism will also be \nposted on the common Accountability Mechanism website.17  \n \n96.  The  CRO  registers  complaints  filed  under  the  Accountability  Mechanism  on  the \nAccountability  Mechanism  website  within  2  days  after  the  complaints  are  received.  The \nregistration includes the name, number, and location of the project. In cases where a complaint \nineligible for the Accountability Mechanism was forwarded to an operations department by the \nOSPF or OCRP for handling, an end-of-process report prepared by the operations department \nwill be posted on the Accountability Mechanism website within 14 days of completion of the \nreport. In case a complaint is forwarded to the OSPF for problem solving or to the CRP for \ncompliance review, the provisions in paras. 97 or 98 and 99  apply.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17  The OSPF and CRP each has distinctive logos and letterheads, which is to be placed under a common ADB \nAccountability Mechanism logo and letterhead. \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 21 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \n97.

Compliance  Review  Function.  The  OCRP  posts  the  following  information  and \ndocuments on the Accountability Mechanism website at the times specified below: \n(i)  the complaint letter (or the request for compliance review)\u2014after the CRP\u2019s \nreceipt  of  the  complaint  letter  forwarded  by  the  CRO  and  subject  to  the \nagreement  of  the  complainants\u2014within  7  days  after  OCRP\u2019s  receipt  of  the \ncomplaint; \n(ii)  a general description of the complaint\u2014within 7 days after the CRP\u2019s receipt of \nthe complaint letter if the complainants have not consented to disclosure of the \ncomplaint letter;  \n(iii)  the CRP report determining that the complaint is eligible and the Board decision \nto authorize the compliance review, together with Management\u2019s response\u2014\nwithin 7 days of the Board decision; \n(iv)  the  CRP  report  determining  that  the  complaint  is  ineligible,  together  with \nManagement\u2019s response\u2014within 7 days of circulation of the report to the Board;  \n(v)  the TOR for the compliance review within 10 days of the Board\u2019s authorization of \nthe compliance review; \n                                                 \n18  \u2015Upon\" as used in paras. 97 and 98 means as soon as it is reasonably practical and generally no later than 14 \ncalendar days. \n19 This is only required if there are remedial actions.

The  SPF  and  CRP  post  the  Accountability  Mechanism  annual  reports  on  the \nAccountability Mechanism website upon completion. The OSPF, OCRP, IED, and RSDD post \nthe learning reports upon completion. OSEC posts the Board information paper on the reasons \nfor a borrowing country\u2019s rejection of a CRP site visit, if applicable,  on the Accountability \nMechanism website within 21 days after submission to the Board.  \n \n100.  The nature of problem solving and compliance review demands an appropriate degree \nof confidentiality. For example, general descriptions about the process and final solution can be \nmade  public,  but  substantive  details  about the  discussions  are kept confidential. The final \nagreement and resolution are also kept confidential if the parties so request. Any information \nsubmitted to the OSPF or OCRP on a confidential basis may not be released to any other \nparties without the consent of the party that submitted it. When requested, the SPF and CRP \nwithhold  the  identities  of  the  complainants  and  their  representatives  if  they  are  also \ncomplainants.  \n \n101.  The  SPF  and  CRP  chair  have  the  authority  to  issue  press  releases  and  public \ncommunications, as appropriate. Before doing so, the SPF or CRP chair informs DER to provide \nADB with an opportunity to prepare responses to queries from the media or the public.  \n \n102.  The SPF and CRP, and all staff working on the Accountability Mechanism, exercise \ndiscretion and maintain a low profile while making site visits or otherwise operating in the \nborrowing country. The SPF and CRP do not give any media interviews at any stage of the \nAccountability Mechanism process. \n \nH.  Application  \n \n103.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  applies  to  all  ADB-assisted  sovereign  and \nnonsovereign operations. In cases where country safeguard systems are used for ADB-assisted \nprojects in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the use of the country \nsafeguard systems does not alter the role and function of ADB's Accountability Mechanism, \nincluding the role of the OSPF and CRP. In the event of a complaint, the CRP could examine \nADB's assessment of the equivalence between ADB's policy scope, triggers, and applicable \nprinciples with the country safeguard systems (and any additional measures agreed upon to \nachieve equivalence) in materially achieving the objectives of the Safeguard Policy Statement, \nas well as ADB's project supervision in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. The \nAccountability Mechanism policy also applies to ADB-administered cofinancing operations.   \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 23 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nI.  Awareness and Learning  \n \n104.  The OSPF and OCRP should update their joint outreach strategy regularly (for example, \nevery 3 years). The OSPF, OCRP, and staff should undertake three kinds of outreach activities. \n \n105.  Internal. This outreach should improve awareness and disseminate lessons to ADB staff \nthrough workshops, training courses, and orientation sessions. The Accountability Mechanism \nshould be included as part of regular staff training. The Accountability Mechanism should be \nseen as an important instrument for learning, and for ensuring project quality and development \neffectiveness. The SPF and OSPF, the CRP chair and OCRP, staff, Management, and the \nBoard should all promote a culture change to eliminate the remaining perception that the \nAccountability Mechanism is adversarial.  \n \n106.  Country level. The OSPF and OCRP should hold regular dissemination activities in \nADB\u2019s DMCs. The OSPF and OCRP should distribute simple, pictorial-based, and user-friendly \ndescriptions of the mechanism. In each resident mission, a staff member should be designated \nas a focal person for handling grievances caused by ADB-financed projects.  \n \n107.  Project level. Improving the awareness of the Accountability Mechanism requires that \nADB  staff  work  as  conduits  to  disseminate  information.  Staff,  working  with  the  borrower, \ndisseminate information early in the project cycle about the Accountability Mechanism and its \navailability as a recourse in case other mechanisms for dealing with harmful project effects are \nnot successful.20 The intensity and format of this activity varies with the nature of the project. \nOperations departments, with support from RSDD as required, focus on projects with a high \ndegree of safeguard risks, such as projects with significant resettlement. The Accountability \nMechanism brochures in national or official languages, community notice boards, audiovisual \nmaterials, or other appropriate and effective means are used to inform people.21 The Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requires that grievance redress mechanisms be set up at the project level. It \nalso requires government staff and/or project proponents to inform affected persons about these \ngrievance  redress  mechanisms.  To  ensure  meaningful  information  sharing,  operations \ndepartments may require the borrower to organize awareness seminars in coordination with \nresident missions, project teams, local government units, and executing agencies. Operations \ndepartments, working with the OSPF and OCRP, may explore the possibility of outsourcing \noutreach activities to suitable and credible nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or civil society \norganizations. Gender issues will be taken into consideration when designing the outreach \nstrategies. \n \n108.  The joint learning reports by OSPF, OCRP, IED, and RSDD distill ADB\u2019s experience, \ninsights, and lessons, including the Accountability Mechanism\u2019s development impacts, benefits, \nand costs. The Accountability Mechanism annual reports (i) outline key activities and outputs of \nthe Accountability Mechanism; (ii) summarize the complaints; (iii) analyze the development \n                                                 \n20  Information on the Accountability Mechanism forms part of the information about the full range of options to \naddress grievances, and may include materials prepared by the OSPF and OCRP. \n21  The outreach materials can make clear that the Accountability Mechanism is the last resort and encourage the use \nof other grievance redress methods first. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 24 of 24 \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n \n \nimpact of the Accountability Mechanism; (iv) discuss the benefits; (v) record and monitor the \ndirect and indirect costs on project-affected people, the borrowers, and ADB for each project; \nand (vi) provide other relevant information and analysis.   \n \n \nBasis:  This OM section is based on OM Section L1/BP and the documents cited \ntherein.  \n \n \nCompliance:   This OM section is subject to compliance review. \n \n \nFor inquiries:   Questions may be directed to the Office of the Special Project Facilitator or the \nOffice of the Compliance Review Panel. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n24 May 2012  Prepared and issued by the  \nThis supersedes OM Section L1/OP   Strategy and Policy Department  \nissued on 19 December 2008.  with the approval of the President. \n \n ", "OM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nAppendix 1 \nPage 1 of 4 \n \nACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM\u2014SUMMARY OF THE PROCESSES \n \n  Table A1.1:  Process for Receiving Complaints \n   \n   \nStep 1.
