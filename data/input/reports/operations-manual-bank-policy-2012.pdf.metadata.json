The \nAccountability  Mechanism  provides  an  independent  and  effective  forum  for  people  adversely \naffected  by  ADB-assisted  projects  to  (i)  voice  their  concerns  and  seek  solutions  to  their \nproblems,  and  (ii)  request  a  review  of  the  alleged  ADB\u2019s  noncompliance  with  its  operational \npolicies  and  procedures  that  may  have  caused  them,  or  is  likely  to  cause  them,  direct  and \nmaterial harm.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nhave the following meaning: \n \n\u2015ADB-assisted project\u2016  \n\nThe following terms, as used in this section (Bank Policies and Operational Procedures), \n\nDefinitions \n\nA project financed or to be financed, or administered or to \nbe  administered,  by  ADB,  and  covers  both  sovereign  and \nnonsovereign operations. \n\n \n\u2015Board\u2016 \n \n\n\u2015borrower\u2016  \n\n \n\n\u2015borrowing country\u2016  \n \n\u2015days\u2016   \n \n\u2015operations department\u2016  \n\n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \n\nWhen  applied  to  a  sovereign  operation,  means  the \nborrower of an ADB loan or the recipient of an ADB grant; \nand when applied to a nonsovereign operation, means the \nborrower,  guarantee  beneficiary,  fund  manager,  investee, \nor  similar  entity  to  which  ADB  lends  or  guarantees,  or  in \nwhich it invests.  \n\nThe country in which the ADB-assisted project is located. \n\n \n\nUnless specified otherwise, refers to working days in ADB. \n\nAny  department  that  handles  the  formulation,  processing, \nor \nimplementation  of  an  ADB-assisted  project.

ADB  must  continue  to \nstrengthen  its  project  design,  implementation,  and  learning  mechanisms  to  prevent  problems \nand  ensure  compliance  from  the  outset,  and  to  deal  with  the  legitimate  concerns  of  project-\naffected people at the project and operational levels wherever possible.  \n \nD. \n\nStructure  \n \n5. \nThe Accountability Mechanism has two functions. The problem solving function is led by \nthe  Special  Project  Facilitator  (SPF),  who  responds  to  problems  of  local  people  affected  by \nADB-assisted projects through a range of informal and flexible methods. The compliance review \nfunction  is  led  by  the  Compliance  Review  Panel  (CRP),  which  investigates  alleged  ADB\u2019s \nnoncompliance  with  its  operational  policies  and  procedures  that  has  caused,  or  is  likely  to \ncause, direct and material harm to project-affected people.  \n \n6. \nTo  provide  an  easily  accessible  single  entry  point  for  project-affected  people,  this  two-\npronged  structure  is  supported  by  a  Complaint  Receiving  Officer  (CRO),  who  receives  all \ncomplaints from people seeking access to the Accountability Mechanism.  \n \nE. \n\nScope of Problem Solving  \n \n7. \nThe problem solving function assists people directly, materially, and adversely affected \nby  specific  problems  caused  by  ADB-assisted  projects  through  informal,  flexible,  and \nconsensus-based  methods  with  the  consent  and  participation  of  all  parties  concerned.  The \nproblem solving function is outcome-driven. It does not focus on the identification and allocation \nof blame, but on finding ways to address the problems of the project-affected people. The SPF \nproblem solving function also aims to strengthen the internal problem solving processes of the \noperations departments. \n \n8. \nThe  scope  of  the  problem  solving  function  is  broader  than  the  compliance  review \nfunction.  People  who  believe  they  have  been  or  will  be  directly,  materially,  and  adversely \naffected by an ADB-assisted project can use the problem solving function regardless of whether \nADB  operational  policies  and  procedures  have  been  complied  with.  However,  the  problem \nsolving function is limited to ADB-related issues concerning ADB-assisted projects. \n\n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/BP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 3 of 4 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n BANK POLICIES (BP) \n\n \n\n \n \nScope of Compliance Review  \n\nF. \n \nCompliance Review Panel. The CRP is a fact-finding body on behalf of the Board. The \n9. \nCRP investigates alleged ADB\u2019s noncompliance with its operational policies and procedures in \nany ADB-assisted project in the course of the formulation, processing, or implementation of the \nproject that directly, materially, and adversely affects local people.  \n\n \n10. \nThe  scope  of  compliance  review  is  ADB's  operational  policies  and  procedures  as  they \nrelate to formulating, processing, or implementing an ADB-assisted project. The scope excludes \nmatters  relating  to  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services  (including  consulting  services), \ncorruption,  and  non-operational  administrative  matters,  such  as  finance  and  administration.  In \ncases where operational policies have been approved by the Board and have become effective \nbut  have  not  been  incorporated  into  the  Operations  Manual  in  a  timely  manner,  or  in  cases \nwhere there is a conflict between a Board-approved policy and an Operations Manual section, \nthe  Board-approved  policies  will  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism.  In \ncases where an Operations Manual section refers to another section that has been superseded, \nthe section that has superseded the cross-referenced section will prevail.1 \n \nA compliance review does not investigate the borrowing country, the executing agency, \n11. \nor the private sector client. The conduct of these other parties is considered only to the extent \nthat  they  are  directly  relevant  to  an  assessment  of  ADB's  compliance  with  its  operational \npolicies and procedures. The compliance review does not provide judicial-type remedies, such \nas injunctions or monetary damages. Relative to a request for problem solving with the SPF, a \nrequest for compliance review is not an appeal to a higher authority. The SPF and CRP are of \nequal standing in the hierarchy of the Accountability Mechanism. \n \nThe  CRP  does  not  consider  the  policies  and  procedures  of  other  institutions  except  to \n12. \nthe  extent  that  ADB's  policies  and  procedures  have  explicitly  incorporated  those  of  the  other \ninstitutions. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Sometimes  an  Operations  Manual  section  has  been  updated  or  replaced,  but  other  sections  still  refer  to  the  old \n\nsection. Such references should be deemed to be references to the new Operations Manual section.   \n\n\f \nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n BANK POLICIES (BP) \n\nOM Section L1/BP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 4 of 4 \n\n \n\n \n \nBasis: \n \n \n \n \n\nThis OM section is based on: \n\nADB. 2012.

The  OSPF  may  engage \n\n \nAppointment and Administrative Matters  \n \n2. \nProblem  Solving.  The  Special  Project  Facilitator  (SPF)  is  appointed  by  the  President \nafter consultation with the Board, and reports directly to the President. The SPF\u2019s term is for 3 \nyears  and  may  be  renewed  for  another  2  years.  The  SPF must  not  have  worked  in  any  ADB \noperations  department  for  at  least  5  years  before  the  appointment.  The  SPF  must  disclose \nimmediately  to the  President  any  personal  interest  or  significant  prior  involvement  in a  project \nthat  is  subject  to  problem  solving  procedures.  The  SPF  has  access  to  all  ADB  staff  and \nManagement,  and  all  ADB  records  that  the  SPF  deems  relevant,  except  personal  information \nthat is typically restricted. The President evaluates the performance of the SPF. \n \n3. \ntechnical experts as consultants to assist OSPF work, including monitoring activities.  \n  \n4. \nCompliance Review Panel. The Compliance Review Panel (CRP) is a fact-finding body \non behalf of the Board. The CRP has three members, one of whom is the chair. The CRP chair \nserves  full  time  and  the  other  two  members  serve  part  time  as  and  when  required.  CRP \nmembers  are  appointed  by  the  Board  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  Board  Compliance \nReview  Committee  (BCRC)  in  consultation  with  the  President.  The  BCRC  directs  the  search \nand  selection  process,  which  may  involve  the  use  of  an  executive  search  firm  if  necessary. \nBudget,  Personnel  and  Management  Systems  Department  (BPMSD),  in  coordination  with  the \nOffice of the Secretary (OSEC), handles the administrative processes.  \n \n5. \nEach  panel  member  has  a  5-year,  nonrenewable  term.  Two  panel  members  are  from \nregional  member  countries,  with  at  least  one  from  a  developing  member  country  (DMC).  The \nthird panel member is from a nonregional member country.  \n\n \n6. \nDirectors, alternate directors, directors\u2019 advisors, Management, staff, and consultants are \nineligible to serve on the CRP until at least 3 years have elapsed from their time of service with \nADB. After serving on the CRP, panel members are barred from any future employment at ADB, \nincluding engagement as consultants. A panel member may be removed by the Board upon the \nrecommendation  of  the  BCRC  and  in  consultation  with  the  President  on  the  grounds  of \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 2 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \ninefficiency  and/or  misconduct.  A  panel  member  will  be  disqualified  from  participating  in  a \ncompliance review if he or she has a personal interest or has had significant prior involvement in \nthe project under review. A panel member must disclose immediately to the BCRC any personal \ninterest or significant prior involvement in a project subject to compliance review. \n \n7. \nThe  CRP  may  engage  technical  experts  as  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  assist  in  its  work,  including  post-compliance  review \nmonitoring. The CRP has access to all ADB staff and Management, and all ADB records that it \ndeems relevant, except personal information that is typically restricted.  \n \n8. \nOffice of the Compliance Review Panel. The Office of the Compliance Review Panel \n(OCRP)  supports  the  CRP.  OCRP  staff  are  ADB  staff  but  report  to  the  CRP  chair.  The  terms \nand conditions of their employment are determined the same way as for other ADB staff. OCRP \nstaff  can  be  transferred  to  and  from  other  parts  of  ADB.  BPMSD  handles  the  administrative \nprocesses in relation to OCRP staff in accordance with ADB guidelines. \n \n9. \nThe CRP chair is responsible for preparing the combined annual work plan and budget \nof the CRP and OCRP,  with due regard to principles of efficiency and cost effectiveness. The \nannual work plan and budget is endorsed by the BCRC in consultation with the President and \nreviewed by the Board\u2019s Budget Review Committee. The work plan and budget proposal is then \npresented to the Board for approval, separately from ADB\u2019s overall administrative budget. The \nBCRC chair, in consultation with other BCRC members, provides written feedback annually on \nthe performance of the CRP members.  \n \n10. \nComplaint  Receiving  Officer.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  jointly  engage  a  Complaint \nReceiving Officer (CRO) from outside ADB, in a way similar to the engagement of the executive \nsecretary of ADB\u2019s Administrative Tribunal. The CRO is engaged on a full-time basis to respond \npromptly  to  complainants.  The  CRO  reports  to  the  SPF  and  the  CRP  chair.  The  CRO  has \naccess to the OSPF, OCRP, and operations departments regarding the status and processing \nof complaints. \n \nBoard  Compliance  Review  Committee.  The  BCRC  consists  of  six  Board  members, \n11. \nincluding four regional members (at least three of whom must be from borrowing countries) and \ntwo nonregional members. The BCRC members are appointed in accordance with the Board's \nRules of Procedure. OSEC provides support to the BCRC.  \n \nC. \n \n\nRoles and Activities  \n\n1. \n\nComplaint Receiving Officer  \n\n \n12. \n\nThe CRO  \n(i) \n\nreceives  all  complaints  from  people  seeking  access  to  the  Accountability \nMechanism and promptly acknowledges them; \nregisters the complaints;  \ninforms  the  complainants  about  whom  to  contact  after  complaints  have  been \nregistered;  \nforwards  complaints  to  either  the  SPF  or  the  CRP  chair,  as  requested  by  the \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\nOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 3 of 24 \n\n(v) \n\ncomplainants;  or  forwards  complaints  that  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the \nAccountability  Mechanism,  such  as  those relating  to procurement  or  corruption, \nto other relevant departments and offices;  \ncopies  the  SPF,  CRP,  and  operations  department  concerned  if  the  complaints \nare not forwarded to them, ensuring the complainants\u2019 identities are not revealed \nto parties other than the SPF and the CRP; \nprovides information to complainants;  \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  maintains  the  landing  page  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism  website  within \nADB\u2019s public website, as directed by the OSPF and OCRP, and working with the \nDepartment of External Relations (DER); and \nundertakes other work as assigned by the SPF and CRP chair. \n\n(viii) \n\nThe CRO carries out all functions with objectivity and neutrality. \n\n2. \n\nOffice of the Special Project Facilitator  \n\nThe OSPF1  \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nprocesses complaints requesting problem solving;  \nobtains from the operations departments all materials relating to the complaints; \nengages  with  all  relevant  parties,  including  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  the \nBoard  member  representing  the  borrowing  country,  Management,  and  staff  to \ngain  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  issues  to  be  examined  during  problem \nsolving; \nfacilitates  consultative  dialogue,  promotes  information  sharing,  undertakes  joint \nfact-finding,2 and/or facilitates the establishment of a mediation mechanism;  \ninforms  the  Board  and  other  stakeholders  about  the  results  of  problem  solving \nactivities;  \n\n(vi)  monitors  the  implementation  of  the  remedial  actions  agreed  upon  during  the \n\nproblem solving process; \ncollates and integrates internal and external experiences with problem solving to \nbe  fed  back  into  ADB's  operations,  including  the  formulation,  processing,  and \nimplementation of projects; \nprovides generic support and advice to operations departments in their problem \nprevention  and  problem  solving  activities,  but  not  for  specific  problems  that  the \noperations departments are working to resolve; \nworks  with  the  OCRP  to  produce  a  clear,  simple,  informative,  and  succinct \ninformation packet about the Accountability Mechanism, highlighting the different \nprocesses and remedies available under the two functions;  \nprepares and publishes Accountability Mechanism annual reports jointly with the \nOCRP;  \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n                                                 \n1   In carrying out the problem solving and other related functions, the SPF, as the head of the OSPF, decides which \n\nactivities will be performed by the SPF and which by the OSPF staff.  \n\n2   Joint  fact-finding  can  be  undertaken  with  parties  that  the  SPF  deems  relevant,  including  the  complainants,  the \n\noperations department concerned, and the borrower.  \n\n \n13. \n  \n\n \n14. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 4 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n \nproduces a learning report every 3 years through joint efforts with the OCRP, the \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department  (IED),  and  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD);  \nraises awareness within ADB and through outreach activities with the public that \ninclude a holistic introduction to the Accountability Mechanism while focusing on \nspecific subjects; \n\n(xiii)  works with the CRO, OCRP, and DER to maintain a common ADB Accountability \nMechanism  website  within  ADB\u2019s  public  website  to  provide  information  on  both \nthe problem solving and compliance review functions;  \nconducts  other  activities  required  to  carry  out  the  problem  solving  function \neffectively and efficiently; and \nliaises with accountability mechanisms at other institutions. \n\n(xiv) \n\n(xv) \n\n \n15. \nThe  OSPF  problem  solving  function  does  not  replace  the  project  administration  and \nproblem  solving  functions  of  the  operations  departments,  which  are  an  inherent  part  of  their \nwork.  Operations  departments  have  the  initial  responsibility  for  responding  to  the  concerns  of \naffected  people.  However,  the  OSPF,  in  consultation  with  the  operations  departments,  carries \nout activities designed to improve the internal problem solving capacity of ADB.3  \n \n16. \nThe  SPF\u2019s  role  is  confined  to  ADB-related  issues  on  ADB-assisted  projects.  The  SPF \ndoes  not  interfere  in  the  internal  matters  of  any  DMC  and  does  not  mediate  between  the \ncomplainants and local authorities. \n \n\nCompliance Review Bodies  \n\n17. \n\n3.   \n \nThe CRP  \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nrepresenting \n\nthe  Board  member \n\nprocesses complaints requesting compliance review;  \nengages  with  all  relevant  parties  and  stakeholders,  including  the  complainants, \nthe  borrowing  country, \nthe  borrower, \nManagement,  and  staff  to  gain  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  issues  to  be \nexamined during the compliance review; \ncoordinates its activities, to the extent appropriate, with those of the compliance \nreview  mechanism  of  any  other  cofinancing  institution  that  is  conducting  a \nseparate compliance review of the same project; \nconducts  thorough  and  objective  reviews  of  compliance  by  ADB  with  its \noperational policies and procedures; \nengages all stakeholders concerned throughout the compliance review process; \nconsults  with  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  the  Board  member  representing \nthe  borrowing  country,  Management,  and  staff  on  its  preliminary  findings;  and \naddresses any resulting comments; \nissues  draft  reports  which  will  be  sent  to  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  the \nBCRC, Management, and the operations department concerned; \ncompletes the compliance review even if the borrowing country refuses to grant a \nsite visit; \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n                                                 \n3   Since 2004, the OSPF has been proactive in improving the internal problem solving capacity of ADB.

A complaint made through a representative must clearly \nidentify  the  project-affected  people  on  whose  behalf  the  complaint  is  made  and  provide \nevidence of the representative\u2019s authority to represent such people.  \n \n27. \nFor a compliance review, complaints may also be filed by any one or more ADB Board \nmembers,  after  first  raising  their  concerns  with  Management,  in  special  cases  involving \nallegations  of  serious  violations  of  ADB's  operational  policies  and  procedures  relating  to  an \nongoing  ADB-assisted  project.  These  alleged  violations  must  have,  or  are  likely  to  have,  a \ndirect, material, and adverse effect on a community or other group of individuals residing in the \nborrowing country or in a member country adjacent to the borrowing country. The conduct of the \ncompliance review requested by a Board member does not affect or limit the existing rights of \nBoard members to request or initiate reviews of ADB policies and procedures. \n \nCompliance reviews cover only ADB-assisted projects.7 The filing of a complaint to either \n28. \nthe  SPF  or  CRP  does  not  suspend  or  otherwise  affect  the  formulation,  processing,  or \nimplementation of the project unless agreed to by the borrower concerned and ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nScope \n\n \nProblem  Solving  Function.  The  problem  solving  function  is  outcome-driven,  focusing \n29. \nnot on the identification and allocation of blame, but on finding ways to address the problems of \nthe  people  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects.  The  scope  of  the  problem  solving  function  is \nbroader  than  the  compliance  review  function.  People  who  believe  they  have  been  or  will  be \ndirectly,  materially,  and  adversely  affected  by  an  ADB-assisted  project  can  use  the  problem \nsolving  function  regardless  of  whether  ADB  operational  policies  and  procedures  have  been \ncomplied  with.  However,  the  problem  solving  function  is  limited  to  ADB-related  issues \nconcerning ADB-assisted projects.  \n \n30. \nCompliance  Review  Function.  The  CRP  examines  whether  the  direct  and  material \nharm alleged by the complainants is the result of ADB's failure to follow its operational policies \nand  procedures  in  the  course  of  formulating,  processing,  or  implementing  an  ADB-assisted \nproject. The scope of compliance review  is ADB's operational policies and procedures as they \nrelate  to  formulating,  processing,  or  implementing  an  ADB-assisted  project.  The  applicable \noperational policies and procedures depend on whether the complaint concerns a proposed or \n\n                                                 \n7   Since ADB cannot control the actions of third parties with respect to associated facilities which are not funded by \n\nADB, such associated facilities are not covered by the Accountability Mechanism. \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 9 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n \nan ongoing project.8 For a proposed project, the applicable policies and procedures are those in \neffect when the complaint is filed with the CRP. For an ongoing project, the applicable policies \nand  procedures  are  those  in  effect  at  the  time  of  the  Board  or  President\u2019s  approval  of  the \nproject, unless otherwise specified in the relevant policies, procedures, or project documents.  \n\n \n31. \nThe  Board  decides  whether  a  policy  is  an  operational  policy  subject  to  compliance \nreview,9 and the CRP determines which part, if any, of the operational policies and procedures \nwas or is not complied with after carrying out a compliance review. ADB\u2019s operational policies \nand  procedures  subject  to  compliance  review  do  not  include  guidelines  and/or  similar \ndocuments  or  statements.  The  CRP  does  not  consider  the  policies  and  procedures  of  other \ninstitutions except to the extent that ADB's policies and procedures have explicitly incorporated \nthose of the other institutions. \n\n \n32. \nTo  determine  noncompliance,  the  CRP  must  be  satisfied  that  there  is  evidence  of  (i) \ndirect and material harm that has been caused by the ADB-assisted project; (ii) noncompliance \nof ADB with its operational policies and procedures; and (iii) the noncompliance as a cause for \nsuch harm.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nExclusions \n\n \n33. \nthey are \n\nComplaints are excluded from both problem solving and compliance review functions  if \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nabout  actions  that  are  not  related  to  ADB's  actions  or  omissions  in  the  course  of \nformulating, processing, or implementing ADB-assisted projects; \nabout matters that complainants have not made good faith efforts to address with \nthe operations department concerned; \nabout an ADB-assisted project for which 2 years or more have passed since the \nloan or grant closing date;10 \nfrivolous, malicious, trivial, or generated to gain competitive advantage; \nabout decisions made by ADB, the borrower or executing agency, or the private \nsector  client  on  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  including  consulting \nservices; \nabout  allegations  of  fraud  or  corruption  in  ADB-assisted  projects  and/or \nmisconduct by ADB staff; \nabout the adequacy or suitability of ADB's existing policies and procedures; \n\n                                                 \n8   A proposed project is a project that is being prepared and has not yet been approved by the Board or the President \n(as delegated by the Board). An ongoing project is a project that has been approved by the Board or the President. \n9   Whether a policy is subject to the Accountability Mechanism is generally indicated in the policy when it is submitted \nto the Board for its consideration. The Operations Manual clearly indicates whether a specific section is subject to \ncompliance review.  \n\n10  For  programmatic  operations,  such  as  multitranche  financing  facilities,  additional  financing,  and  single-tranche \npolicy loans under one program, the cutoff  is tranche- (or its equivalent) based. For projects whose loan or grant \nclosing  dates  are  extended  after  project  completion  for  purposes  such  as  capitalizing  interest  payments  and \nliquidation  or  for  which  the  loan  or  grant  closing  date  is  not  relevant,  the  cutoff  date  is  2  years  after  the  project \ncompletion date. In the case of nonsovereign projects for which the loan or grant closing date is not relevant, the \ncutoff  date  is  2  years  after  the  project  is  physically  completed  or,  where  physical  completion  is  waived  or  is  not \nrelevant  (e.g.,  financial  intermediation  projects),  1  year  after  the  date  of  the  final  disbursement  or  termination  of \nADB's involvement in the project, whichever occurs earlier. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 10 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n(viii)  within  the  jurisdiction  of  ADB's  Appeals  Committee  or  ADB's  Administrative \n\n(ix) \n\nTribunal, or relate to ADB personnel matters; and/or \nabout  ADB's  non-operational  administrative  matters,  such  as  finance  and \nadministration. \n\nThe problem solving function also excludes  \n(i) \n\nmatters  already  considered  by  the  OSPF,  unless  the  complainants  have  new \nevidence  previously  not  available  to  them  or  the  subsequent  complaint  can  be \nreadily consolidated with the earlier complaint; in such cases, any resubmission \nor consolidation of a complaint, as the case may be, should occur within 2 years \nafter the loan or grant closing  date; and/or  \nmatters  that  are  being  dealt  with,  or  have  already  been  dealt  with,  by  the  CRP \n(including  those  that  have  completed  the  compliance  review  process),  except \nthose  complaints  considered  ineligible  for  compliance  review  by  the  CRP.  The \nrequest for problem solving after the CRP  has found the complaint ineligible for \ncompliance review must take place within 2 years after the loan or grant closing \ndate.11  \n\nThe compliance review function also excludes complaints that \n(i) \n\nrelate  to  actions  that  are  the  responsibility  of  other  parties,  such  as  a  borrower, \nexecuting agency, or potential borrower, unless the conduct of these other parties \nis  directly  relevant  to  an  assessment  of  ADB's  compliance  with  its  operational \npolicies and procedures;  \ndo not involve ADB\u2019s noncompliance with its operational policies and procedures;  \nare  being  dealt  with  by  the  OSPF  up  to  the  completion  of  step  3  under  the \nproblem solving function; \nrelate to the laws, policies, and regulations of the borrowing country, unless they \ndirectly relate to ADB's compliance with its operational policies and procedures; \nand/or \nare about matters already considered by the CRP, unless the complainants have \nnew evidence previously not available to them and the subsequent complaint can \nbe  readily  consolidated  with \nthe  earlier  complaint.  In  such  cases,  any \nresubmission or consolidation of a complaint, as the case may be, should occur \nwithin 2 years after the loan or grant closing date. \n\n(ii) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nHow to File a Complaint  \n\n \n36. \nComplainants  are  encouraged  to  first  address  their  problems  using  project-level \ngrievance  redress  mechanisms  to  facilitate  prompt  problem  solving  on  the  ground.  However, \nthis is not a precondition for their access to the Accountability Mechanism. \n \nF. \n \n37. \nComplaints  from  people  seeking  access  to  the  Accountability  Mechanism  must  be  in \nwriting and preferably addressed to the CRO. Complaints may be submitted by mail, facsimile, \ne-mail, or hand delivery to the CRO at ADB headquarters. Complaints are also accepted by any \nADB office, such as a resident mission or representative office, which will forward them to the \nCRO. The working language of the Accountability Mechanism is English, but complaints may be \n                                                 \n11 All complaints to the SPF or CRP must be filed within 2 years after the loan or grant closing date..  \n\n \n\n \n34. \n\n \n35. \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 11 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n \nsubmitted  in  any  of  the  official  or  national  languages  of  ADB's  DMCs.

The identities of complainants are kept confidential unless the complainants agree \nto  disclose  their  identities,  but  anonymous  complaints  are  not  accepted.  The  identities  of \nrepresentatives  who  are  not  at  the  same  time  complainants  are  not  kept  confidential,  but  are \ndisclosed to ensure transparency.  \n\n38. \n\n \nThe complaint must specify the following: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nnames,  addresses,  and  contact  information  of  the  complainants  and  their \nrepresentative(s); \nif a complaint is made through a representative, the names of the project-affected \npeople  on  whose  behalf  the  complaint  is  made  and  evidence  of  the  authority  to \nrepresent them; \nwhether the complainants choose to keep their identities confidential;  \nwhether the complainants choose to undergo problem solving with the OSPF or \ncompliance review with the CRP; \na brief description of the ADB-assisted project, including its name and location; \na  description  of  the  direct  and  material  harm  that  has  been,  or  is  likely  to  be, \ncaused to the complainants by the ADB-assisted project;  \na description of the complainants\u2019 good faith efforts to address the problems first \nwith the operations department concerned, and the results of these efforts; and \nif  applicable,  a description  of the complainants\u2019 efforts  to  address  the  complaint \nwith the OSPF, and the results of these efforts. \n \n\nan  explanation  of  the  complainants\u2019  claim  that  the  direct  and  material  harm \nalleged  is,  or  will  be,  caused  by  the  alleged  failure  by  ADB  to  follow  its \noperational  policies and procedures  in the  course  of formulating,  processing,  or \nimplementing the ADB-assisted project; \na  description  of  the  operational  policies  and  procedures  that  have  not  been \ncomplied with by ADB in the course of formulating, processing, or implementing \nthe ADB-assisted project;  \na  description  of  the  complainants\u2019  efforts  to  address  the  problems  with  the \nproject-level grievance redress mechanisms concerned, and the results of these \nefforts; \nthe desired outcome or remedies that complainants believe ADB should provide  \nthrough the Accountability Mechanism; and  \nany other relevant matters or facts with supporting documents. \n\n39. \n\nComplaints may also include the following information: \n(i) \n\n40. \n\n(v) \n \nA template for filing complaints will be posted on the ADB website.  \n \nProcessing Complaints  \n\nG. \n \n41. \nThe  complainants  decide  and  indicate  in  the  complaint  whether  they  want  to  initiate \nproblem  solving  or  compliance  review.  They  can  exit  or  disengage  from  the  problem  solving \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 12 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \nprocess  at  any  time,  which  will  terminate  the  process.12  After  exiting  or  disengaging  from  the \nproblem  solving  process,  the  complainants  may  request  the  CRO  to  forward  the  complaint  to \nthe CRP for compliance review. To meet the cutoff date for compliance review, such a request \nmust be made within 2 years of the loan or grant closing date.  \n \n42. \nComplainants  can  also  request  compliance  review  upon  completion  of  step  3  of  the \nproblem  solving  process  if  they  have serious concerns  about  compliance  issues. In that  case, \ncompliance review of the complaint, if found eligible, is carried out in parallel with step 4 of the \nproblem solving process.  \n \n43. \nComplainants  can  also  exit  or  disengage  from  the  compliance  review  process  at  any \ntime, which will terminate the process. However, unless the complaint is found ineligible by the \nCRP, they cannot switch from compliance review to problem solving regardless of whether the \ncompliance review was completed. Complainants can provide additional information or evidence \non  the  complaint  during  the  problem  solving  or  compliance  review  processes.  However, \ncomplaints about different issues are considered new complaints.  \n \n44. \nThe  SPF  and  CRP  determine  independently  whether  the  complaint  meets  their \nrespective eligibility  criteria.  The  SPF and CRP  fully  share  information and analysis  with each \nother on the complaint.   \n\n \nThe complaint processes are described in paras. 46\u201387.  \n\n45. \n \n\n1. \n\nReceiving Complaints  \n\n \n46. \ntheir \nStep  1:  Receiving  and  registering  a  complaint.  The  complainants  or \nrepresentative(s)  file  a  complaint  with  the  CRO.  Complaints  received  by  any  other  ADB \ndepartments  or  offices  from  people  seeking  to  access  the  Accountability  Mechanism  are \nforwarded  to  the  CRO.  The  CRO  informs  the  SPF,  the  CRP  chair,  and  the  operations \ndepartment concerned about the complaint within 2 days of receiving it, attaching a copy of the \ncomplaint  letter.  Unless  the  complainants  have  clearly  indicated  that  confidentiality  is  not \nrequired,  the  CRO  takes  necessary  measures  when  copying  or  forwarding  the  information  to \nensure the confidentiality of the complainants\u2019 identities (for example, by masking the names of \nthe complainants). The CRO also stresses to all parties concerned within ADB the importance \nof ensuring the confidentiality requested by complainants. The CRO registers the complaint on \nthe  Accountability  Mechanism  website  within  2  days  of  receiving  it.  This  is  an  administrative \nstep and does not mean the complaint is eligible for problem solving or compliance review. \n \n47. \nStep  2:  Acknowledging  the  complaint. Within  2  days  of  receiving  the  complaint,  the \nCRO  acknowledges  receipt  of  the  complaint  and  sends  an  Accountability  Mechanism \ninformation packet to the complainants. The information packet indicates that the complainants \ncan  choose  to  undertake  either  problem  solving  or  compliance  review.  It  highlights  the \ndifferences  between the  two functions,  explaining  that  the  problem  solving function  addresses \nproblems  on  the  ground  and  facilitates  their  resolution,  while  the  compliance  review  function \nreviews ADB\u2019s compliance with its operational policies and procedures. The resulting remedies \n                                                 \n12  Exiting from the process occurs when the complainants make it known that they do not want to pursue the process \n\nany further. Disengagement occurs when the complainants no longer respond. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 13 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n \n(if  any)  to bring  a project  into  compliance may  or  may  not mitigate  any harm.  The  information \npacket also explains the procedural differences between the two functions. \n\n \n48. \nIf  the  complainants\u2019  choice  for  either  problem  solving  or  compliance  review  is  clearly \nindicated in the complaint letter, the CRO informs them that they can change their choice within \n21  calendar  days  from  the  date  of  the  CRO\u2019s  acknowledgement  letter.  If  the  complainants\u2019 \nchoice is not clearly indicated in the complaint letter, the CRO asks them to clarify their choice \nwithin 21 calendar days from the date of the CRO\u2019s acknowledgement letter.   \n\n \n49. \nStep  3:  Forwarding  the  complaint.  Within  5  days  after  the  CRO\u2019s  deadline  for  the \ncomplainants  to  notify  the  CRO  of  any  change  in  their  choice,  the  CRO  decides  whether  to \nforward the complaint to \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nthe SPF if the complainants indicated a choice for problem solving; or \nthe CRP chair if the complainants indicated a choice for compliance review; or \nother  relevant  departments  and/or  offices  as  appropriate  if  the  complaint  falls \noutside  the  mandate  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism,  such  as  a  complaint \nconcerning  procurement  or  corruption,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ADB \npolicy or procedure. \n\n \n50. \nThe  CRO  informs  relevant  parties  within  ADB\u2014including  the  SPF,  CRP  chair,  the \noperations  department,  and  any  other  departments  or  offices\u2014about  its  decision  on  where  to \nforward the complaint, explaining the basis for the decision. The CRO gives the relevant parties \n3  days  to  raise  any  objections  and  concerns  regarding  his/her  decision.  The  relevant  parties \nmay  only  object to  the  CRO\u2019s  decision  if they find  that the  complainants\u2019  choice has  not  been \nproperly reflected in the decision. If there is no objection, the CRO forwards the complaint to the \nrelevant party and copies other relevant parties.  \n\n \n51. \nIf the complainants have not clearly indicated a choice for problem solving or compliance \nreview,  or  if  any  party  in  ADB  objects  to  the  CRO\u2019s  decision  regarding  where  to  forward  the \ncomplaint,  the  CRO  returns  the  complaint  to  the  complainants  and  seeks  their  clarification.  In \nsuch  a  case,  the  CRO  again  includes  the  information  packet  on  ADB\u2019s  Accountability \nMechanism.  The  CRO  gives  the  complainants  60  calendar  days  from  the  date  of  the  CRO\u2019s \nletter  to  respond.  If  the  complainants  do  not  respond  by  the  deadline,  the  Accountability \nMechanism process ends, and the CRO informs the complainants accordingly.  \n\n \n52. \nStep 4: Informing the complainants. Within 2 days of forwarding the complaint to the \nrelevant party, the CRO notifies the complainants and their authorized representative(s) about \nwhich party will consider the complaint and the contact person(s) for the subsequent steps.  \n\n53. \n\nTable A1.1 in Appendix 1 summarizes the complaint receiving process.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nThe Problem Solving Function \n\n \n54. \nThe problem solving process takes about 180 days from the registration of the complaint \nto an agreement on remedial actions. This excludes translation time, any request for extension \nto  provide  information  or  file  documents,  and  the  time  needed  by  the  parties  to  facilitate  the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 14 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \nresolution  of  their  problems.  The  OSPF  may  draw  on  the  project-level  grievance  redress \nmechanisms and/or the operations departments to resolve problems.  \n\n \n55. \nStep 1: Determining eligibility. The SPF screens the complaint forwarded to him or her \nby the CRO13 and determines its eligibility  within 21 days of receiving the complaint. To find a \ncomplaint eligible, the SPF must (i) be satisfied that the complaint meets all eligibility criteria for \nproblem solving; and (ii) believe, in his or her sole discretion, that the SPF\u2019s involvement could \nbe useful.   \n\n \n56. \nIn  determining  whether  the  complaint  is  eligible,  the  OSPF  reviews  whether  the \ncomplainants made prior good faith efforts to solve the problems with the operations department \nconcerned. The OSPF forwards the complaint to the operations department if the complainants \ndid not make such efforts. The OSPF consults and seeks information from relevant parties, such \nas the complainants, the borrower, and the operations department. The OSPF also ascertains \nwhether confidentiality has been requested by the complainants, including any representatives \nwho are at the same time also complainants, and takes the necessary actions. \n\n \n57. \nThe  SPF  reports  the  decision  on  eligibility  to  the  President,  with  a  copy  to  the  vice-\npresident  concerned,  the  operations  department,  and  the  CRO.  The  SPF  informs  the \ncomplainants upon the determination of eligibility.  \n \n58. \nStep  2:  Review  and  assessment.  If  the  complaint  is  eligible,  the  OSPF  reviews  and \nassesses  the  complaint  to  (i)  understand  the  history  of  the  complaint,  (ii)  confirm  the \nstakeholders,  (iii)  clarify  the  issues  of  concern  and the  options  for  resolving  them,  (iv)  explore \nthe stakeholders' readiness for joint problem solving, and (v) recommend how the problems can \nbest be solved.  \n \n59. \nThe review may include site visits; interviews; and meetings with the complainants, the \nborrower, and any other people the OSPF believes would be helpful and beneficial. The OSPF \nobtains information from the operations department concerned and, if necessary, requests the \noperations  department\u2019s  advice and support. The  OSPF  conducts fact-finding  missions  on the \nSPF\u2019s  own  initiative;  or  participates,  in  consultation  with  the  operations  department,  in  special \nproject administration missions of the operations department.  \n \n60. \nThe OSPF completes  the  review  and  assessment,  and  the  SPF  reports the findings to \nthe President, with a copy to the vice-president concerned. The OSPF also sends the findings to \nthe  complainants,  the  borrower,  and  the  operations  department,  with  a  request  for  their \ncomments. Based on the assessment and taking into account the comments received, the SPF, \nsolely  at  his  or  her  discretion,  (i)  decides  whether  to  proceed  with  problem  solving,  or  (ii) \ndetermines that no further problem solving efforts will be purposeful and concludes the process. \nThe OSPF is expected to take about 120 days from determination of eligibility to complete the \nreview and assessment. \n \n61. \nStep 3: Problem solving. If problem solving proceeds, the OSPF assists the parties to \nengage in resolving the problems. The problem solving process depends on the circumstances. \n                                                 \n13  The forwarding of the complaint by the CRO to the SPF does not constitute a determination of the eligibility of the \n\ncomplaint.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 15 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n \nThe OSPF may facilitate  a  consultative dialogue,  promote information  sharing,  undertake joint \nfact-finding, facilitate the establishment of a mediation mechanism, and/or use other approaches \nto problem solving. The time required for the problem solving varies depending on the nature, \ncomplexity, and scope of the problems.  \n\n \n62. \nImplementing the problem solving process requires the consent of every party involved. \nExcept  for  the  SPF,  any  party  can  walk  away  from  the  process  if  it  does  not  consider  it \npurposeful or if there is no consensus. This would formally close the problem solving process. \n \n63. \nRemedial  actions  that  are  adopted  as  a  result  of  the  problem  solving  process  are \nreflected in a written agreement or series of agreements among the parties. Remedial actions \ninvolving  a  change  in  the  project  require  approval  according  to  ADB's  applicable  procedures \nand agreement by the borrower. \n \n64.  When the problem solving process has been completed (with or without any agreement), \nthe SPF submits a report to the President, with a copy to the vice-president and the  operations \ndepartment concerned, summarizing the complaint, steps to resolve the issues, decisions by the \nparties, and the agreement, if any, by the parties. The SPF issues this report and furnishes it to \nthe  complainants,  the  borrower,  the  CRP,  and  the  Board  for  information.  If  there  is  no \nagreement, the problem solving process ends upon completion of this step. \n \n65. \nUpon  submitting  the  report  to  the  President  (para.  64),  with  or  without  agreement,  the \ncomplainants  can  also  request  the  CRO  to  forward  the  complaint  to  the  CRP  for  compliance \nreview  if  they  have  serious  concerns  on  compliance  issues,  to  be  carried  out  with  the \nimplementation and monitoring of the remedial actions reached at the problem solving stage, if \nany (step 4). To meet the time limit for eligibility for compliance review, the request to the CRO \nmust be made within the cutoff date of 2 years after the loan or grant closing date.  \n \nStep  4:  Implementation  and  monitoring.  The  relevant  parties  implement  the  agreed \n66. \nremedial  actions,  and  the  OSPF  monitors  their  implementation.  As  part  of  the  monitoring \nprocess,  the  OSPF  consults  with  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  and  the  operations \ndepartment. The monitoring time frame is project specific, depending on the implementation of \nthe  remedial  actions,  but  generally  does  not  exceed  2  years.  All  stakeholders,  including  the \npublic, may submit information regarding the status of implementation to the OSPF.  \n \n67. \nThe  OSPF  prepares  monitoring  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  remedial  actions. \nThese reports are sent to the complainants, the borrower, and the operations department; and \nsubmitted to the President and copied to the Board for information. If the monitoring time frame \nexceeds 1 year, the OSPF produces annual monitoring reports. If the monitoring time frame is \nabout 1 year or less, the monitoring results may be included in the OSPF final report described \nin step 5. In monitoring the remedial actions, the OSPF produces either monitoring reports for a \nsingle complaint or combined monitoring reports for multiple complaints.14  \n \n \n                                                 \n14  In  the  case  of  combined  monitoring  reports,  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  and  the  operations  department  will \n\nonly be sent the portion of the report about the complaints relevant to them. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 16 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n68. \nStep 5: Conclusion of the problem solving process. When the monitoring has been \ncompleted,  the  OSPF  prepares  a  final  report  and  the  SPF  submits  it  to  the  President,  the \ncomplainants, the borrower, the operations department, the CRP, the BCRC, and the Board for \ninformation. The OSPF produces either a final report for a single complaint or a combined final \nreport for multiple complaints (footnote 14).  \n \n69. \n \n\nTable A1.2 in Appendix 1 summarizes the problem solving process.  \n\n3. \n\nThe Compliance Review Function  \n\n \n70. \nThe compliance review process is expected to take about 200 days from the registration \nof the complaint to the Board\u2019s consideration of the CRP final report, including about 70 days to \nBoard authorization of  the  compliance review.  These periods  exclude  time for  translation,  any \nrequest for extension to provide information or file documents, and the time for conducting the \ncompliance review, which is not time-bound.  \n \nStep  1:  Requesting  Management  response.  The  CRP  carries  out  an  initial \n71. \nassessment of the complaint forwarded by the CRO and determines within 5 days of receiving it \nwhether it falls within the  mandate  of the compliance  review  function.  Upon  determining  this, \nthe CRP forwards the complaint to Management and requests a response within 21 days. In its \nresponse, Management should (i) provide evidence that ADB has complied with the relevant \nADB  policies  and  procedures;  or  (ii)  acknowledge  that  there  have  been  failures  in  ADB\u2019s \ncompliance with its policies and procedures, and express its intention to take actions to ensure \ncompliance to the extent possible. Management response may  also include other information \nthat  Management  deems  relevant.  The  CRP  copies  the  BCRC  in  its  correspondence  with \nManagement.  The  CRP  informs  the  borrower  and  the  Board  member  representing  the \nborrowing  country  about  receipt  of  the  complaint.  The  CRP  should  ascertain  whether \nconfidentiality is being requested by the complainants, including any representatives who are at \nthe same time also complainants, and take the necessary actions. \n \n72. \nStep  2:  Determining  eligibility. Within  21  days  of  receiving  Management\u2019s  response, \nthe  CRP  determines  the  eligibility  of  the  complaint.15  The  CRP  reviews  the  complaint, \nManagement\u2019s response, and other relevant information. To find a complaint eligible, the CRP \nmust be satisfied that the complaint meets all eligibility criteria for compliance review. The CRP \nmust  be  satisfied  that  (i)  there  is  evidence  of  noncompliance;  (ii)  there  is  evidence  that  the \nnoncompliance  has  caused,  or  is  likely  to  cause,  direct  and  material  harm  to  project-affected \npeople;  and  (iii)  the  noncompliance  is  serious  enough  to  warrant  a  compliance  review.  If  the \nCRP finds that the alleged direct and material adverse effect is not totally or partially caused by \nADB\u2019s  noncompliance,  its  eligibility  determination  states  this  without  analyzing  the  direct  and \nmaterial adverse effect itself or its causes. \n\n \n73. \nAs  part  of  the  eligibility  determination,  the  CRP  reviews  and  determines  whether  the \ncomplainants  made  prior  good  faith  efforts  to  resolve  issues  with  the  operations  department \nconcerned.  The  CRP  forwards  the  complaint  to  the  operations  department  if  there  is  no \nevidence that the complainants made such efforts.  \n                                                 \n15 The forwarding of the complaint by the CRO to the CRP does not constitute a determination of the eligibility of the \n\ncomplaint. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 17 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n \n74. \nThe  CRP  informs  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  the  Board  member  representing  the \nborrowing country, Management, and the operations department of its determination concerning \neligibility.  \n \nStep  3:  Board  authorization  of  compliance  review.  The  CRP  submits  its  eligibility \n75. \nreport through the BCRC to the Board, attaching the complaint and Management\u2019s response. If \nthe  CRP  determines  that  the  complaint  is  eligible,  it  recommends,  that  the  Board  authorize  a \ncompliance  review.  Within  21  calendar  days  from  receipt  of  the  CRP's  recommendation,  the \nBoard  decides\u2014on  a  no-objection  basis  and  without  making  a  judgment  on  the  merits  of  the \ncomplaint\u2014whether  to  authorize  the  compliance  review.  Within  7  days  from  receipt  of  the \nBoard\u2019s authorization, the OCRP informs the complainants of the Board\u2019s decision.  \n \nStep 4: Conducting compliance review. Within 10 days from the receipt of the Board\u2019s \n76. \nauthorization to conduct the compliance review,  the BCRC clears the TOR for the compliance \nreview prepared by the CRP and the OCRP provides the TOR to the Board for information with \na  copy  to  Management.  The  TOR  includes  the  scope,  methodology,  estimated  review  time \nframe,  budget,  CRP  member(s),  and  other  necessary  information  for  the  compliance  review. \nThe scope of the TOR is limited to the specific complaint. The TOR may also provide for a site \nvisit by the CRP. In that case, the TOR clearly explains why a site visit is necessary, what will \nbe reviewed, and how it will be conducted.  \n \n77. \nThe CRP begins the compliance review upon receiving the Board\u2019s authorization and the \nBCRC\u2019s clearance of the TOR. The time required for the CRP's review varies depending on the \nnature,  complexity,  and  scope  of  the  project  and  the  alleged  noncompliance.  Throughout  the \ncompliance review process, the CRP consults, as appropriate, all relevant parties, including the \ncomplainants, \nthe  borrowing  country, \nManagement, and staff. These parties are given an opportunity to record their views, if any. The \ncompliance review may include desk reviews, meetings, discussions, and a site visit.  \n  \n78. \nStep 5: Compliance Review Panel's draft report.  Upon completion of its compliance \nreview,  the  CRP  issues  a  draft  report  of  its  findings  to  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  and \nManagement  for  comments  within  45  days.  The  CRP  also  forwards  the  draft  report  to  the \nBCRC for its review. Each party is free to provide comments, but only the CRP's final view on \nthese matters is reflected in its final report. \n \n79. \nThe CRP compliance review report focuses on the specific complaint. It documents the \nCRP\u2019s findings concerning any noncompliance, and alleged direct and material harm. It includes \nall  relevant  facts  needed  to fully  understand  the  context  and basis  for  the CRP\u2019s  findings  and \nconclusions.  It  focuses  on  whether  ADB  failed  to  comply  with  its  operational  policies  and \nprocedures  in  formulating,  processing,  or  implementing  the  project  in  relation  to  the  alleged \ndirect and material harm. In case the CRP concludes there was noncompliance, it specifies the \nexact  provisions  in  the  relevant  operational  policies  or  procedures  with  which  ADB  failed  to \ncomply. It also ascertains whether the alleged direct and material harm exists. If noncompliance \nis  found  and  the  alleged  direct  and  material  harm  is  confirmed,  the  report  further  focuses  on \nestablishing whether the noncompliance was a cause of the alleged harm.  \n\nthe  Board  member  representing \n\nthe  borrower, \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 18 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n80. \nFor assessing direct and material harm, the without-project situation is used as the base \ncase  for  comparison,  based  on  available  information.  Non-accomplishments  and  unfulfilled \nexpectations  that  do  not  generate  direct  and  material  harm  compared  to  the  without-project \nsituation are excluded. If the CRP finds that the alleged direct and material adverse effect is not \ntotally  or  partially  caused  by  ADB\u2019s  noncompliance,  its  compliance  review  report  states  this \nwithout  analyzing  the  direct  and  material  adverse  effect  itself  or  its  causes.  Because  the \nassessment of direct and material harm in the context of the complex reality of a project can be \ndifficult, the CRP exercises careful judgment in these matters and is guided by ADB policies and \nprocedures where relevant.   \n \n81. \nStep  6:  Compliance  Review  Panel's  final  report.  Within  14  days  of  receiving  the \ncomments on its draft report from the complainants, the borrower, and Management, the CRP \nconsiders  these  comments  and  makes  changes  as necessary  before  issuing  its final  report to \nthe  Board through  the  BCRC.  The  CRP\u2019s final  report  attaches  a matrix  of  comments from  the \ncomplainants, the borrower, and Management, and the CRP\u2019s response to such comments. The \nCRP's  findings  are  reached  by  consensus  among  the  panel  members.  In  the  absence  of  a \nconsensus, the majority and minority views are stated. \n \n82. \nStep  7:  Board  consideration  of  the  Compliance  Review  Panel\u2019s  report.  Within  21 \ncalendar days of receiving the CRP's final report, the Board considers the report. Within 7 days \nafter  the  Board\u2019s  consideration,  the  CRP's  final  report\u2014with  the  responses  from  the \ncomplainants,  the  borrower,  and  Management  attached\u2014is  released  to  the  complainants  and \nthe  borrower.  If  the  CRP  concludes  that  there  was  no  noncompliance  by  ADB,  or  that  any \nnoncompliance  by  ADB  did  not  cause  direct  and  material  harm  to  the  complainants,  the \ncompliance review process ends upon completion of this step. \n \n83. \nthat  ADB\u2019s \nnoncompliance  caused  direct  and  material  harm,  Management  proposes  remedial  actions, \nwhich  may  include an  action  plan,  to  bring  the  project  into  compliance  with  ADB  policies and \naddress  related  findings  of  harm.  Because  the  legal  ownership  of  the  project  lies  with  the \nborrower,  which  also  has  the  principal  responsibility  for  implementing  the  remedial  actions, \nManagement must obtain the agreement of the borrower on the remedial actions. Management \nmay consult the CRP in developing the remedial actions. Management refers its draft remedial \nactions to the  CRP  and seeks  its  comments to be  provided  within  5 days.  Upon receiving the \nCRP comments, Management submits a report on the proposed remedial actions to the Board, \nattaching the CRP comments. The report specifies the parties responsible for implementing the \nremedial actions, estimates of costs to implement the remedial actions, and parties to shoulder \nthe  costs.  The  expected  period  of  time  between  the  Board\u2019s  consideration  of  the  CRP  final \ncompliance  review  report  and  Management\u2019s  submission  of  the  proposed  remedial  actions  to \nthe Board is 60 days.  \n\nStep  8:  Management\u2019s  remedial  actions. \n\nIf  the  CRP  concludes \n\n \n84. \nStep  9:  Board\u2019s  decision.  The  Board  considers  Management\u2019s  proposed  remedial \nactions within 21 calendar days of receiving them. The Board makes a decision regarding the \nremedial actions to bring the project into compliance and mitigate any harm, as appropriate. The \nBoard\u2019s decision, Management\u2019s remedial actions, and the CRP comments are released to the \ncomplainants and the borrower within 7 days after the Board\u2019s decision.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 19 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \n \n85. \nStep  10:  Monitoring  and  conclusion.  The  CRP  monitors  implementation  of  remedial \nactions  approved  by  the  Board,  if  any.  It  reports  to  the  Board  concerning  implementation  of \nBoard  decisions  related  to  remedial  measures,  including  its  determination  on  the  progress  in \nbringing the project into compliance.  \n \n86. \nAny  remedial  actions  in  relation  to  project  scope  or  implementation  approved  by  the \nBoard  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with applicable  ADB  policies and procedures.  Unless the \nBoard specifies a different timetable, the CRP reports on the progress annually. The CRP chair, \nin  consultation  with  the  BCRC,  determines  which  CRP  member(s)  will  conduct  the  monitoring \nexercise  each  year.  The  monitoring  time  frame  is  project-specific,  depending  on  the \nimplementation  of  the  remedial  actions,  but  generally  does  not  exceed  3  years.  The  final \nmonitoring report also concludes the compliance review process.  \n \n87. \nThe methodology for monitoring may include (i) consultations with the complainants, the \nborrower,  the  Board  member  concerned,  Management,  and  staff;  (ii)  a  review  of  documents; \nand (iii) site visits. The CRP also considers any information received from the complainants and \nthe public regarding the status of implementation. The CRP forwards its draft monitoring reports \nto the BCRC for review. It finalizes the reports in consultation with the BCRC before making them \navailable to the complainants, the borrower, the Board, Management, staff, and the public.  \n \n88. \n \n\nTable A1.3 in Appendix 1 summarizes the compliance review process.  \n\n4. \n\nOperations Departments\u2019 Handling and Tracking of Complaints  \n\n \nOperations departments address problems or issues relating to complaints forwarded to \n89. \nthem by the OSPF or OCRP because the complainants did not make prior good faith efforts to \nsolve the problems or issues with the departments. Operations departments ascertain whether \nconfidentiality  is  being  requested  by  the  complainants  and  take  the  necessary  actions. \nOperations departments track the process and results in resolving the complaints forwarded to \nthem  by  the  OSPF  or  OCRP,  and  they  may  develop  a  tracking  system.16  Operations \ndepartments,  including  resident  missions,  are  encouraged  to  keep  records  of  meetings, \ncorrespondence, and other relevant information regarding complaints.  \n\n \n90. \nAt  the  end  of  the  process  of  addressing  the  ineligible  complaints  forwarded  to  the \noperations  departments  by  the  OSPF  or  OCRP,  the  operations  department  produces  a  report \nsummarizing the complaint, issues, actions taken to address the problems or issues, decisions \nor  agreements  by  parties  concerned,  results,  and  lessons.  This  report  is  posted  on  the \nAccountability Mechanism website within 14 days of its completion (para. 96). \n\n \n5. \n\nSite Visits \n\n \n91. \nSite  visits  should  be  a  routine  and  noncontroversial  aspect  of  the  Accountability \nMechanism. ADB adopts a partnership approach to help ensure that necessary site visits by the \n                                                 \n16  The  OSPF  developed  a  tracking  system  in  2009  in  collaboration  with  the  Office  of  Information  Systems  and \nTechnology  and  the  India  Resident  Mission.  Operations  departments  may  draw  from  this  and  other  existing \nsystems.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 20 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \nCRP take place. Goodwill and collaboration between the CRP and the borrowing countries are \nnecessary.  Site  visits  will  take  place  in  consultation  with  the  borrowing  country  and  after \nobtaining  the  borrowing  country\u2019s  consent,  for  both  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  operations. \nADB expects borrowing countries to cooperate and allow site visits to take place. \n \n92. \nThe  CRP  is  responsible  for  arranging  site  visits  and ensuring  the  independence  of  the \nprocess.  Management  and  staff,  especially  those  in  resident  missions,  will  facilitate  the  CRP \nvisits  when  required  and  when  requested  by  the  CRP.  Resident  missions  may  assist  in \nobtaining  the  borrowing  country  government\u2019s  consent,  and  may  share  the  site  visit  and \ncompliance  review  TOR  with  the  borrowing  country  government.  The  CRP  is  encouraged  to \nseek  the  assistance  of  the  ADB  Board member representing  the  borrowing country  and share \nthe TOR with the Board member before submitting a mission request to the DMC through the \nresident mission.  \n \n93. \nIf  a  site  visit  is  declined,  Management  will  discuss  with  the  borrowing  country  the \nreasons for not accepting the requested visit. In consultation with the BCRC and the borrowing \ncountry, Management will convey the reasons to the Board through an information paper.  \n \n94. \nIf  a  site  visit  is  declined,  the  CRP  will  complete  the  compliance  review  and  deliver  its \nfindings  and  final  views  in  its  final  report  without  a  site  visit.  The  CRP  will  use  all  available \ninformation,  and  may  make  appropriate  assumptions  and  draw  appropriate  inferences  in \ncompleting  the  compliance  review.  The  CRP  will  present  the  best  and  most  detailed  analysis \npossible  after  exhausting  the  most  cost-effective  and  logical  alternative  means  to  acquire  the \nnecessary information. In the absence of a necessary site visit, the CRP may give added weight \nto the complainants\u2019 views.  \n \nG. \n\nTransparency and Information Disclosure  \n \nInformation  disclosure  to  the  public  is  consistent  with  the  fundamentals  of  the  Public \n95. \nCommunications  Policy  (2011).  A  common  ADB  Accountability  Mechanism  website  has  been \nset  up  within  the  ADB  website.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  have  their  own  components  within  this \ncommon  website.  Any  other  information  related  to  the  Accountability  Mechanism  will  also  be \nposted on the common Accountability Mechanism website.17  \n \n96. \nThe  CRO  registers  complaints  filed  under  the  Accountability  Mechanism  on  the \nAccountability  Mechanism  website  within  2  days  after  the  complaints  are  received.

The  OSPF,  OCRP,  IED,  and  RSDD  post \nthe learning reports upon completion. OSEC posts the Board information paper on the reasons \nfor  a  borrowing  country\u2019s  rejection  of  a  CRP  site  visit,  if  applicable,  on  the  Accountability \nMechanism website within 21 days after submission to the Board.  \n\n \n\n100.  The nature of problem solving and compliance review demands an appropriate degree \nof confidentiality. For example, general descriptions about the process and final solution can be \nmade  public,  but  substantive  details  about  the  discussions  are  kept  confidential.  The  final \nagreement  and  resolution  are  also  kept  confidential  if  the  parties  so  request.  Any  information \nsubmitted  to  the  OSPF  or  OCRP  on  a  confidential  basis  may  not  be  released  to  any  other \nparties without  the  consent  of  the  party  that  submitted  it. When  requested,  the  SPF and CRP \nwithhold  the  identities  of  the  complainants  and  their  representatives  if  they  are  also \ncomplainants.  \n \n\n101.  The  SPF  and  CRP  chair  have  the  authority  to  issue  press  releases  and  public \ncommunications, as appropriate. Before doing so, the SPF or CRP chair informs DER to provide \nADB with an opportunity to prepare responses to queries from the media or the public.  \n \n102.  The  SPF  and  CRP,  and  all  staff  working  on  the  Accountability  Mechanism,  exercise \ndiscretion  and  maintain  a  low  profile  while  making  site  visits  or  otherwise  operating  in  the \nborrowing  country.  The  SPF  and  CRP  do  not  give  any  media  interviews  at  any  stage  of  the \nAccountability Mechanism process. \n\n \nApplication  \n\nH. \n \n103.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  applies  to  all  ADB-assisted  sovereign  and \nnonsovereign operations. In cases where country safeguard systems are used for ADB-assisted \nprojects  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  use  of  the  country \nsafeguard  systems  does  not  alter  the  role  and  function  of  ADB's  Accountability  Mechanism, \nincluding the role of the OSPF and CRP. In the event of a  complaint, the CRP could examine \nADB's  assessment  of  the  equivalence  between  ADB's  policy  scope,  triggers,  and  applicable \nprinciples  with  the  country  safeguard  systems  (and  any  additional  measures  agreed  upon  to \nachieve equivalence) in materially achieving the objectives of the Safeguard Policy Statement, \nas well  as ADB's  project  supervision  in accordance  with the  Safeguard Policy  Statement. The \nAccountability Mechanism policy also applies to ADB-administered cofinancing operations.   \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \n Issued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 23 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\nAwareness and Learning  \n\n \n \nI. \n \n104.  The OSPF and OCRP should update their joint outreach strategy regularly (for example, \nevery 3 years). The OSPF, OCRP, and staff should undertake three kinds of outreach activities. \n \n105. \nInternal. This outreach should improve awareness and disseminate lessons to ADB staff \nthrough  workshops,  training  courses,  and  orientation  sessions.  The  Accountability  Mechanism \nshould  be  included  as  part  of  regular  staff  training.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  should  be \nseen as an important instrument for learning, and for ensuring project quality and development \neffectiveness.  The  SPF  and  OSPF,  the  CRP  chair  and  OCRP,  staff,  Management,  and  the \nBoard  should  all  promote  a  culture  change  to  eliminate  the  remaining  perception  that  the \nAccountability Mechanism is adversarial.  \n\n \n\n106.  Country  level.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  should  hold  regular  dissemination  activities  in \nADB\u2019s DMCs. The OSPF and OCRP should distribute simple, pictorial-based, and user-friendly \ndescriptions of the mechanism. In each resident mission, a staff member should be designated \nas a focal person for handling grievances caused by ADB-financed projects.  \n \n107.  Project  level.  Improving  the  awareness  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism  requires  that \nADB  staff  work  as  conduits  to  disseminate  information.  Staff,  working  with  the  borrower, \ndisseminate  information  early  in  the  project  cycle  about  the  Accountability  Mechanism  and  its \navailability as a recourse in case other mechanisms for dealing with harmful project effects are \nnot  successful.20  The  intensity  and  format  of  this  activity  varies  with  the  nature  of  the  project. \nOperations  departments,  with  support  from  RSDD  as  required,  focus  on  projects  with  a  high \ndegree  of  safeguard  risks,  such  as  projects  with  significant  resettlement.  The  Accountability \nMechanism  brochures  in  national  or  official  languages,  community  notice  boards,  audiovisual \nmaterials, or other appropriate and effective means are used to inform people.21 The Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requires that grievance redress mechanisms be set up at the project level. It \nalso requires government staff and/or project proponents to inform affected persons about these \ngrievance  redress  mechanisms.  To  ensure  meaningful \ninformation  sharing,  operations \ndepartments  may  require  the  borrower  to  organize  awareness  seminars  in  coordination  with \nresident  missions,  project  teams,  local  government  units,  and  executing  agencies.  Operations \ndepartments,  working  with  the  OSPF  and  OCRP,  may  explore  the  possibility  of  outsourcing \noutreach activities to suitable and credible nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or civil society \norganizations.  Gender  issues  will  be  taken  into  consideration  when  designing  the  outreach \nstrategies. \n\n \n\n108.  The  joint  learning  reports  by  OSPF,  OCRP,  IED,  and  RSDD  distill  ADB\u2019s  experience, \ninsights, and lessons, including the Accountability Mechanism\u2019s development impacts, benefits, \nand costs. The Accountability Mechanism annual reports (i) outline key activities and outputs of \nthe  Accountability  Mechanism;  (ii)  summarize  the  complaints;  (iii)  analyze  the  development \n\n                                                 \n20  Information  on  the  Accountability  Mechanism  forms  part  of  the  information  about  the  full  range  of  options  to \n\naddress grievances, and may include materials prepared by the OSPF and OCRP. \n\n21  The outreach materials can make clear that the Accountability Mechanism is the last resort and encourage the use \n\nof other grievance redress methods first. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nPage 24 of 24 \n\nOPERATIONS MANUAL \n OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES (OP) \n\n \nimpact  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism;  (iv)  discuss  the  benefits;  (v)  record  and  monitor  the \ndirect  and  indirect  costs  on  project-affected  people,  the  borrowers,  and ADB  for  each  project; \nand (vi) provide other relevant information and analysis.   \n \n \nBasis: \n\nThis  OM  section  is  based  on  OM  Section  L1/BP  and  the  documents  cited \ntherein.  \n\n \n \nCompliance:   This OM section is subject to compliance review. \n \n \nFor inquiries:   Questions may be directed to the Office of the Special Project Facilitator or the \n\nOffice of the Compliance Review Panel. \n\n24 May 2012 \nThis supersedes OM Section L1/OP  \nissued on 19 December 2008. \n\nPrepared and issued by the  \nStrategy and Policy Department  \nwith the approval of the President. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOM Section L1/OP \nIssued on 24 May 2012 \nAppendix 1 \nPage 1 of 4 \n \n\nACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM\u2014SUMMARY OF THE PROCESSES \n\nTable A1.1:  Process for Receiving Complaints \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nWithin 2 days of receiving  \nthe complaint \n\nWithin 2 days of receiving  \n the complaint \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWithin 5 days after the 21- day \n \ndeadline for complainants to \n \nchange their choice \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWithin 2 days of forwarding the \ncomplaint to the relevant party, \nor failure of the complainants to \nclarify their choice \n\nStep 1.

The problem solving function is led by \nthe  Special  Project  Facilitator  (SPF),  who  responds  to  problems  of  local  people  affected  by \nADB-assisted projects through a range of informal and flexible methods. The compliance review \nfunction  is  led  by  the  Compliance  Review  Panel  (CRP),  which  investigates  alleged  ADB\u2019s \nnoncompliance  with  its  operational  policies  and  procedures  that  has  caused,  or  is  likely  to \ncause, direct and material harm to project-affected people.  \n \n6. \nTo  provide  an  easily  accessible  single  entry  point  for  project-affected  people,  this  two-\npronged  structure  is  supported  by  a  Complaint  Receiving  Officer  (CRO),  who  receives  all \ncomplaints from people seeking access to the Accountability Mechanism.  \n \nE. \n", "Scope of Problem Solving  \n \n7. \nThe problem solving function assists people directly, materially, and adversely affected \nby  specific  problems  caused  by  ADB-assisted  projects  through  informal,  flexible,  and \nconsensus-based  methods  with  the  consent  and  participation  of  all  parties  concerned.  The \nproblem solving function is outcome-driven. It does not focus on the identification and allocation \nof blame, but on finding ways to address the problems of the project-affected people. The SPF \nproblem solving function also aims to strengthen the internal problem solving processes of the \noperations departments. \n \n8. \nThe  scope  of  the  problem  solving  function  is  broader  than  the  compliance  review \nfunction.  People  who  believe  they  have  been  or  will  be  directly,  materially,  and  adversely \naffected by an ADB-assisted project can use the problem solving function regardless of whether \nADB  operational  policies  and  procedures  have  been  complied  with.
