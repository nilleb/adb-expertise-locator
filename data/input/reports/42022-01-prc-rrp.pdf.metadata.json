The forested area per capita is only 0.13 ha, well below \nthe world average of 0.65 ha. The standing stock volume amounts to less than 10 m3 per capita, \nwhich is significantly lower than the world average of 66 m3. Since the 1980s, the government \nhas  adopted  a  series  of  policy  reforms  to  address  the  issues  of  forest  resource  conservation \nand  ecosystem  restoration,  shifting  its  forestry  policy  from  resource  exploitation  to  resource \nprotection.  The  PRC\u2019s  forest  cover  has  since  increased  to  18.2%  with  extensive  plantation \ndevelopment  programs.  Rapid  economic  growth  over  the  last  2  decades  has  escalated  the \ncountry\u2019s demand for forest products, including wood fiber, which has put pressure on forests in \nother parts of the developing world and raised concerns regarding global climate change. \n \n4. \nForestation to sequester carbon is a key action the government cites in China\u2019s Policies \nand  Actions  for  Addressing  Climate  Change.3 The  government  established  the  Green  Carbon \nFund in 2007 to promote carbon sequestration in forests and help domestic enterprises achieve \nvoluntary  emission  reductions.  The  State  Forestry  Administration  is  developing  guidelines  for \ncarbon  accounting  and  monitoring,  which  will  be  used  to  gauge  and  register  carbon \nsequestration  by  forestry  projects.  Based  on  the  State  Forestry  Administration\u2019s  assessment, \nJiangxi  Province  meets  the  criteria  for  developing  forest  carbon  stock4 and  is  on  the  list  of \nregions where promoting carbon sequestration projects is prioritized.  \n \n5. \nProject  area.  The  project  will  take  place  in  23  counties  of  8  cities  in  Jiangxi  Province, \nwhich  is  mountainous  and  underdeveloped.  The  provincial  gross  domestic  product  per  capita \nwas CNY14,727 in 2008, one-third less than the national average. About 5% of the population \nlives below the national rural poverty line of CNY1,067 per year. Of the 23 project counties, 15 \nare  classified  as  national  or  provincial  poverty  counties.  Forestry  plays  an  important  role  in \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  ($700,000,  approved  in \n\n3   Information  Office  of  the  State  Council  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  2008.  China\u2019s  Policies  and  Actions  for \n\n4  The  criteria  include  forest  growth  rate,  potential  for  biodiversity  conservation,  plantation  cost,  and  per  capita \n\nNovember 2008). \n\nAddressing Climate Change. Beijing. \n\nincome. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nJiangxi\u2019s  economic  development  and  environmental  sustainability.  The  sector\u2019s  gross  output \nincreased  fivefold  during  2000\u20132008  to  reach  CNY76 billion  in  2008,  which  is  14%  of  the \nprovincial  gross  domestic  product.  About  10.6  million  ha,  or  62.5%  of  the  provincial  area,  is \ndesignated  forestland,  of  which  1.5  million  ha  is  barren  or  low  yielding.  The  provincial  forest \nstock  is  353.5  million  m3,  an  average  of  34.4  m3/ha,  much  lower  than  the  national  average  of \n76.0 m3/ha and the world average of 99.8 m3/ha.  \n \n6. \nSector  performance,  problems,  and  opportunities.  Jiangxi  Province  is  an  important \nsource  of  wood  and  bamboo,  accounting  for  7%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  wood  production  and  8%  of  its \nbamboo  production  in  2008.  In  Jiangxi,  forests  logs  are  mainly  used  as  sawn  timber,  veneer, \nand fiberboard for domestic uses. Resin and a variety of chemical products are other products \nof forest materials. In 2008, the consumption of forest products was 7.6 million m3, and demand \nfor raw timber was 6 million m3. Currently, the province produces only 4.6 million m\u00b3 of timber \nand  meets  the  deficit  with  imports  from  abroad  and  neighboring  provinces.  The  government \nforesees an increase in demand as many wood-processing enterprises in Jiangxi expand their \nproduction capacity or plan to do so.5   \n \n7. \nThe  JPG  has  established  a  long-term  forestry-development  plan  to  meet  provincial \ndemand for forest products and improve its forest ecosystem. The plan aims to promote public \nand  private  investments  in  forestry  to  increase  forest  coverage  from  60.05%  to  63%,  forest \nstock  to  750  million  m3,  average  production  to  90  m3/ha,  and  total  forestry  output  to  CNY160 \nbillion  by  2020.  To  promote  forestry  development  in  the  province,  the  JPG  launched  its \nforestland tenure reform program in 2004 and, in 2008, distributed the management rights of 8.6 \nmillion  ha  of  collective  forestlands  to  10  million  farm  households.  The  JPG  further  issued  a \nprovincial  order  to  develop  trading  centers  for  forestry  property  rights  in  counties  to  provide \nservices  to  forest  farmers  and  the  private  sector  regarding  forestland  tenure  and  property \nregistration, legal consultation, and the trading of forestry properties and products. Reform has \nresulted  in  remarkable  effects  on  forestry  development:  (i)  prices  for  forest  products  have \nincreased  significantly,  (ii)  a  market  for  leasing  forestland  is  developing  and  growing,  and  (iii) \nprivate forest enterprises and household forest enterprises are emerging. \n \n8. \nThe  core  problem  of  the  Jiangxi  forestry  sector  is  the  fragility  of  its  forest  ecosystem, \nwhich cannot satisfy the social and economic development needs of the province. Major causes \nof  the  problem  include  (i)  the  underutilization  of  forestlands  for  lack  of  investment  funds  or \naccess to credit, (ii) the historical overexploitation of forest resources, (iii) communities\u2019 lack of \nknowledge  of  or  skill  in  forest  management,  and  (iv)  the  lack  of  institutional  experience  in \nsustainable forest management. The underutilization of forestland has significantly damaged the \nenvironment,  causing  soil  erosion,  siltation  in  rivers  and  lakes,  and  the  deterioration  of  water \nquality and reservation.  \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  International  development  partners  have  supported  the \n9. \nefforts of the Government of the PRC and the JPG toward forestry development since the early \n1990s,  which  has  improved  forest  cover  in  the  province.  After  the  logging  ban  and  speedy \neconomic  growth  since  then,  and  considering  the  challenges  of  climate  change  that  the \ninternational community faces, the government and international development partners support \nsector  development  to  (i)  meet  growing  domestic  demand  for  forest  products  to  ease  the \npressure  on  forest  resources  in  other  developing  countries,  (ii)  improve  forest  management \nknowledge  and  practices  to  enhance  the  environmental  value  of  forests,  and  (iii)  introduce \n\n                                                 \n5   Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n       \n\n         \n\n3\n\ninnovative  practices  to  strengthen  forest  carbon  storage  and  access  additional  financing  for \nforestation, such as carbon financing and forest insurance.6 The project is in line with the PRC \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2008\u201320107 and  the  development  strategies  of  both  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government.8 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe project impact will be improved sustainable forest management that enhances forest \nproduction,  environmental  benefits,  and  rural  livelihoods  in  Jiangxi  Province.  The  project  will \nhelp the JPG achieve its long-term forestry-development goals, contribute to the sequestration \nof  150,000  tons  of  carbon  per  year  through  afforestation  and  reforestation,  and  develop \ninstitutional  capacity  in  Jiangxi  to  mitigate  climate  change  and  enhance  the  environmental \nbenefits of forests. The project outcome will be improved forest cover and rural livelihoods in the \nproject area. It is estimated that the forest cover in the project area will expand by 1% after the \ncompletion  of  the  project  planting,  9  million  m3 of  timber  will  be  produced,  and  6 million  labor-\ndays of employment will be created. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nOutput 1: Sustainable forest plantation development and rehabilitation. The project \nwill  develop  35,700  ha  of  timber  plantation  on  barren  forestland  to  improve  forest  productivity \nand help meet local demand for construction materials and other wood products. Major timber \nspecies include Chinese fir and slash pine. Broadleaf trees will be planted in fire protection belts \nto improve ecological biodiversity and multiply the functions of the timber plantation. The project \nwill also rehabilitate 11,200 ha of low-yielding and snowstorm-damaged bamboo forests. Ninety-\ntwo forest farms, 34 forest enterprises, 190 large households, 200 united households, and 5,100 \nindividual  households9   will  participate  directly  in  plantation  activities.  The  project  will  support \nfarmers\u2019 planting of broadleaf species mixed with bamboo groves to protect them from climate-\nrelated  disasters,  pests,  and  disease.  The  project  will  also  support  farmers\u2019  establishment  of \n4,000  ha  of  economic  tree  crops,  including  orange,  tea  tree  oil,  and  tea,  to  improve  the \nproductivity of project land and rural households\u2019 income.  \n \nOutput 2: Strengthening forest insurance for natural risk mitigation. The project will \n12. \nprovide  35,700  ha  of  timber  plantation  to  improve  the  resilience  of  forest  farmers  and  forest \nenterprises and support the government\u2019s initiative to establish insurance to protect the forestry \nsector  from  natural  risks.  The  insurance  output  follows  the  forest  insurance  initiative  that  has \nbeen piloted in the PRC since 2009. The premium for commercial forests is about CNY1.20 per \nmu,  or  0.15%  of  the  CNY800  that  is  the  average  forest  value  per  mu.10 The  total  premium  for \nthe  insured  area  will  be  CNY0.64  million  per  year.  The  government  will  subsidize  60%  of  the \npremium, and the forest farmers will bear the remaining 40%. Insurance for timber plantations \nwill  start  in  the  fourth  year  of  project  implementation.  The  project  will  organize  training \nworkshops to raise awareness of the impacts of natural risks on forest development and ways to \nmitigate them. \n\n                                                 \n6   Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila.  \n8   Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  To be selected for participation, farms and farmers must (i) hold land-use rights that are valid for a minimum of 25 \nyears  to  the  land  at  a  proposed  subproject  site,  (ii)  have  technical  capability  that  can  comply  with  forestation-\nrelated  regulatory  requirements,  (iii)  show  that  forestation  land  does  not  overlap  with  the  sites  of  projects \nsponsored by other external assistance agencies, and (iv) demonstrate capacity to repay loans.   \n\n10 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 ha = 15 mu). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe People\u2019s Insurance Company (Group) of China is assigned by the JPG as the sole \n13. \npromoter  of  the  insurance  policy  because  the  company  is  the  largest  property  insurance \ncompany in the PRC and has many branch offices and service stations in rural Jiangxi to serve \nforest  farmers.  The  company  will  support  project  workshops  by  providing  resource  persons. \nAwareness-raising  training  and  capacity  development  will  open  up  opportunities  for  dialogue \namong  stakeholders  and  are  expected  to  facilitate  the  improvement  of  the  forest  insurance \npolicy and, consequently, its sustainability in the PRC. \n \nOutput  3:  Capacity  development  for  sustainable  forest  management.  The  project \n14. \nwill  introduce  an  ecosystem  management  approach  to  the  development  and  management  of \nforest resources that requires changes in farmers\u2019 behavior and the adaptation of new plantation \nskills  and  techniques.  The  project  will  implement  a  training  and  extension  program  to \ndisseminate sustainable forest management concepts and corresponding technical silvicultural \nguidelines  to  project  staff  and  beneficiaries  to  improve  farmers\u2019  forestation  practices  for  more \nprofit  and  sustainability.  The  training  will  involve  existing  forestry  and  agriculture  extension \nnetworks  in  counties  and  townships,  with  the  project  supporting  a  program  to  train  trainers.  A \ngrant of $1 million will be financed by ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund (CCF) to support capacity \ndevelopment.  The  grant  will  (i)  demonstrate  and  establish  a  monitoring,  verification,  and \nreporting system following State Forestry Administration guidelines to improve the forest carbon \nstock  in  Jiangxi  and  (ii)  pilot  sustainable  forest  management  in  selected  project  counties  to \nimprove forest composition and production.  \n \n15. \nOutput 4: Project management support. The project will establish an adequate project \norganization  at  the  three  levels  of  forest  administration\u2014provincial,  county,  and  township\u2014\nsupported by the corresponding guiding, advisory, and control bodies. Training will enable the \nstaff  of  the  project  management  office  (PMO),  project  implementation  offices,  and  the \ncorresponding  forest  administration  units  to  manage  the  project  following  the  financial  and \ntechnical management standards of ADB and the government, as they support beneficiaries in \nthe  implementation  of  afforestation  through  technical  and  administrative  assistance.  Major \nactivities  will  include  (i)  developing  and  implementing  domestic  training  programs  for  project \nstaff and (ii) preparing and disseminating training materials. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n16. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $66.39  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$4.12 million to be financed by the government. The investment cost comprises a base cost of \n$57.58  million,  contingencies  of  $4.70  million,  and  financing  charges  during  implementation  of \n$4.11  million.  The  base  cost  will  mainly  support  output  1  with  $53.45  million.  The  investment \ncost of output 2, $0.27 million, will be financed by the JPG and beneficiaries to pay insurance \npremiums for 35,700 ha of timber plantation.

The  government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  of \n$15.96 million equivalent for plantation and forest insurance as a grant to beneficiaries, capacity \ndevelopment,  and  project  management  support.  State  forest  farms  and  forest  enterprises  will \nuse  the  ADB  loan  to  purchase  seedlings  and  labor  and  contribute  $9.43  million  equivalent  for \nlabor, forest insurance, and contingencies. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  6  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction, as applicable, to be capitalized in the loan), \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements. 12  The \nfinancing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (loan)a \nAsian Development Bank (grant)b \nGovernment \nForest farms and enterprises \nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\na  Transportation and insurance are eligible for ADB financing. \nb Financed by the Climate Change Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n40.00 \n1.00 \n 15.96 \n 9.43 \n66.39 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n60.25 \n1.51 \n24.04 \n14.20 \n100.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n18. \nThe  PRC  is  the  borrower  of  the  ADB  loan.

On behalf of the \nborrower,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  JPG  for \nonlending  to  project  beneficiaries  through  the  city  or  county  finance  bureaus  with  the  same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed from \nthe provincial finance department through the municipal and county finance bureaus to project \nbeneficiaries, who will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks. The loan \nfunds transfer arrangements and indicative funds flow of the loan proceeds and CCF grant are \nprovided in the project administration manual. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n19. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  1  May  2011  to  30  April  2017.  The \nJPG, represented by the Jiangxi Forestry Department (JFD), will be the executing agency. The \nproject county or district governments will be the implementing agencies. The JPG will set up a \nproject  leading  group  to  provide  policy  guidance  for  project  implementation.  The  JFD  will \nestablish  a  PMO  in  its  foreign  fund  utilization  office  to  take  charge  of  day-to-day  project \nmanagement. The PMO comprises eight regular staff, including two finance officers and three \nproject  officers.  Each  participating  county  will  establish  a  project  implementation  office  led  by \nthe director of each county forestry bureau. \n \nAll  procurement  under  the  ADB  loan  and  CCF  grant  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \n20. \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Major  procurement  items  will  include \nseedlings  and  labor  for  forestation.  The  procurement  of  these  items  will  follow  established \ncommercial  practices,  with  an  assessment  carried  out  during  project  preparation  found \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The disbursement of loan proceeds \nand the CCF grant will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, amended from time \nto time). The local Digital Forestry Center will conduct surveys for forest carbon measurement. \nThe center is a subsidiary of the Jiangxi Academy of Forest Inventory and Planning and is the \nonly organization in the province that specializes in applying geographical information systems \nto the mapping and managing of forest resources. Selected center staff can be further trained to \nestablish  the  monitoring,  verification,  and  reporting  system  and  carbon  sink  monitoring.  To \nensure that capacity will be developed and retained in the province, the center will participate in \nthe capacity development component and conduct surveys.  \n \n21. \nThe JPG requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for the procurement of \nseedlings and labor before loan effectiveness (but not more than 1 year prior to the signing of \nthe loan and project agreements) to cope with seasonal constraints on plantation development. \nThe  amount  of  retroactive  financing  is  estimated  to  be  $8  million,  which  is  20%  of  the  loan \namount.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project.  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocuments  and  contracts.

These values are above the currently accepted hurdle \nrate of 12%. \n \nThe financial internal rate of return for the whole project is estimated at 17.4%, and the \n23. \nfinancial net present value is CNY2.53 billion. The financial internal rate of return is 15.9% for \ncommercial  forests,  20.6%\u201324.9%  for  economic  forests,  and  19.7%  for  bamboo  forests. \nCalculations for individual forest types include (i) the costs of materials and equipment, such as \nseeds  and  seedlings,  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  manure,  equipment  hire,  and  tools;  (ii)  labor \ncosts \ntending,  road  maintenance,  guardhouse \nconstruction, and harvesting; and (iii) all relevant provincial and national taxes and fees. \n\nfor  site  clearing,  preparation,  planting, \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n24. \nThe  JFD,  the  Jiangxi  Finance  Department,  and  implementing  agencies  have  adequate \ncapacity  for  financial  management,  including  undertaking  procurement,  providing  counterpart \nfunds, and organizing loan repayments. The project beneficiaries, comprising individual farmers, \nenterprises, and forest farms, generally have satisfactory capacity for financial management and \nloan  repayment.  The  JFD  lacks  direct  experience  with  ADB  project  management  but  is \nexperienced  in  managing  projects  funded  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies.  The \nproject  will  provide  training  to  project  staff  on  ADB  project  administration,  particularly  on \nprocurement  and  disbursement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  JFD  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nAn  estimated  25,500  rural  households  will  benefit  from  the  project,  with  5,500 \nhouseholds  increasing  their  income  by  participating  directly  in  afforestation  and  bamboo \nrehabilitation  and  20,000  households  benefiting  indirectly  from  the  project  by  leasing  their \nforestland to others. The 20,000 households will lease out 24,000 ha of land for a total of CNY9 \nmillion  per  year.15 The  households  can  opt  for  different  leasing  arrangements,  such  as  profit-\nsharing. Training on the advantages and disadvantages of various leasing arrangements will be \nprovided  to  farmers  to  enable  them  to  choose  the  best  way  to  sustain  their  livelihood.  The \ntraining  will  encourage  farmer  leasers  to  participate  in  forest  management  to  enhance  their \nforestland-management  knowledge  and  skills.  Project  implementation  will  create  6  million \nperson-days of employment.  \n \n26. \nThe  gender  analysis  indicated  that  the  project  faces  issues  regarding  women\u2019s \ninsufficient participation in decision making. Forestry is dominated by males because it involves \nheavy work and requires long hours away from the village. Under the proposed project, women \nwill (i) participate in household decision making for land-lease arrangements, (ii) benefit from the \nplanting  and  management  of  economic  trees  close  to  the  village,  and  (iii) receive  livelihood \ntraining.  Women  will  be  able  to  sign  agreements  related  to  the  project,  particularly  lease \nagreements.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n       \n\n         \n\n9\n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment  \n\n \nThe  project  is  environmental  category  B.  The  executing  agency  prepared  a  domestic \n27. \nenvironmental assessment report, which was approved by the Jiangxi provincial environmental \nprotection  department  on  14  December  2009.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). The initial environmental examination indicates that the project is expected to \nachieve significant environmental benefits, including (i) annual carbon sequestration equivalent \nto  150,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide,  (ii)  soil  erosion  reduction  by  100,000  tons  per  year,  (iii) \nannual  water  conservation  of  19  million  m3,  and  (iv) improved  habitats  and  increased \nbiodiversity in the ecosystems of previously bare mountains and slopes. Adverse environmental \nimpacts  are  limited  to  minor  construction  impacts  such  as  the  risk  of  erosion  during  the \npreparation  of  planting  sites  and  minor  construction,  as  well  as  forest  fires.  It  is  expected  that \nthese adverse environmental impacts will be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level by \nimplementing the environmental management and monitoring plan.16  \n \n\n2. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  (IR)  and  indigenous \n28. \npeoples (IP), and will need no IR or IP plan following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The \nJPG will ensure that no land acquisition or change of land use will occur. Land for reforestation \nhas  already  been  classified  as  forestland  and  distributed  to  users.  The  executing  agency  has \nprovided  assurances  that  all  land-lease  arrangements  with  smallholders,  directly  or  by \nenterprises, will be voluntary and implemented in an equitable and transparent way, so that they \nwill not harm people\u2019s livelihoods. No ethnic minority communities live in the project area. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  Major risks of the project include price fluctuations for forest products; climate disasters, \nforest  fires,  plant  pathogens,  or  pests  that  may  affect  the  quality  of  forest  products;  farmers\u2019 \nadherence to outmoded forestation practices; poor quality seeds and seedlings; and the lack of \ntimely  counterpart  funds.  The  major  risks  and  their  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in \nTable 4. Overall, the integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs.17 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPrice fluctuations for forest \nproducts \n\nClimate disasters, forest fires, \nand plant pathogens affect the \nquantity and quality of \nproducts  \n\nFarmers adhere to old \nforestation practices \n\nProject design and implementation allow flexibility to cope with market changes. \n\nFarmers diversify to commercial tree species and adopt flexible harvesting plans. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nTaking out forest insurance is one of the selection criteria for project beneficiaries. \n\nClimate change mitigation measures will be demonstrated through Climate Change \nFund grant assistance \n\nAwareness-raising training on sustainable forest management will be provided. \n\nThe outcome of the sustainable forest management practices will be disseminated. \n\n                                                 \n16  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nUnavailability of high-quality \nseeds and seedlings \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nInspection plans will be executed at various plantation stages to ensure the use of \ncertified, high-quality seeds and seedlings, with funds released based on \ndevelopment progress made and outputs achieved. \n\nLack of timely counterpart \nfunds \n\nThe financial status of participating farms and farmers will be reviewed before \nentering into onlending agreements \n\nProvincial and county governments provide guarantees.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n30. \nThe Government of the PRC and the JPG have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies and guidelines, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31. \nforestland transactions are voluntary. \n \n32. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n \n\nThe  government  and  the  JPG  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nThe  government  and  the  JPG  have  assured  ADB  that  all  forestland  leasing  and  other \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n33. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $40,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Jiangxi \nSustainable Forest Ecosystem Development Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;
