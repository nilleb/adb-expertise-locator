An initial \nSafeguards Assessment  environmental  examination  and  an  environmental  management \nplan were prepared and are summarized in Appendix 12. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Appendix 11 contains a summary resettlement plan. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is designed to improve the urban environment and \npublic health for the urban and suburban residents in Colombo \nthrough improvements to wastewater management services. The \nProject  will  support  (i)  upgrading  the  sewerage  infrastructure, \nincluding pumping stations, sewer pipes, and discharge outfalls; \n(ii) strengthening institutional and operational capacity in asset \nmanagement,  financial  management,  operational  performance \nmonitoring,  environmental  regulatory  compliance,  customer \nservices,  and  pro-poor  sanitation  services;  and  (iii)  project \nmanagement and implementation. \n   \nRationale  Colombo is Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and administrative center. The \nGovernment,  in  its  Ten-Year  Development  Framework,  2006\u2013\n2016, targets high and steady economic growth and modernization \nof the capital region as the national growth engine. The Western \nRegion  Structure  Plan,  adopted  by  the  Government  as  the \ndevelopment plan for the country\u2019s capital region, emphasizes the \ncritical  role  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services,  including \nwastewater management, in sustaining the national economy and \nimproving the quality of life in the Greater Colombo area.  \n \nWhile the Colombo urban area is rapidly expanding, the coverage \nof the existing public sewerage infrastructure is limited. Most of \nthe  system  has  been  run  exceeding  its  technical  life  and  is \ntherefore inefficient and unreliable. Emergency repairs rather than \nplanned  maintenance  are  normal  practices.  Assets  are  not \ninventoried and there is no accurate database on the condition of \nassets. The customer database is inaccurate and is not regularly \nupdated. Frequent blockages in the system cause flooding in low-\nlying areas and the uncontrolled overflow has serious environment \nand  public  health  implications.  There  is  no  institutionalized \nmechanism to monitor operational performance or environmental \ncompliance.  ", "ii   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban \nenvironment and public health for 1.5 million urban and suburban \nresidents  in  Greater  Colombo.  The  expected  outcome  of  the \nProject  is  improved  wastewater  management  services  to \napproximately 645,000 residents within the project area. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $116.6 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $16.5 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \n$80 million from its ordinary capital resources (OCR) and a loan of \n$20 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources (ADF). \nThe OCR loan will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility and will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, and financing charges \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility. The ADF loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace  period,  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period.  The \nGovernment will finance the full amount of taxes and duties and \nthe temporary resettlement cost. \n  \nTotal \nSource  ($ million)  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  100.00   \n  OCR Loan  80.00  68.6 \n  ADF Loan  20.00  17.1 \nGovernment  16.63  14.3 \n  Total  116.63  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  Government  will  pass  on  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  the \nTerms  Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and the National Water Supply \nand Drainage Board (NWSDB) as a blend of grant (82.5%) and \nloan (17.5%). The relending terms for the loan portion will be at \nthe rate of 10% per annum, with a repayment period of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2015  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils (MLGPC) \n   \nImplementation  MLGPC will be the Project\u2019s Executing Agency. CMC will be the \nArrangements  implementing agency responsible for most of the activities, except \nfor the pumping station rehabilitation works within the NWSDB \nservice area, for which NWSDB will be the implementing agency. \nA project management unit (PMU) will be established within CMC, \ndirectly under the municipal commissioner, led by a CMC officer at \nsenior management level for the duration of the Project. A project ", "  iii\nimplementation unit (PIU) will be established under NWSDB for \nimplementing the works within NWSDB service area. A national \nproject  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nMLGPC  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  coordination  to  the \ngovernment agencies involved in the administrative process of the \nProject. \n   \nProcurement  A  draft  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared  based  on \ndiscussions  with  the  proposed  executing  and  implementing \nagencies.  Procurements  to  be  financed  by  the  Project  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated \nto  cost  $3  million  or  more,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at \n$500,000 or higher.  \n \nThe size of the procurement packages will depend on the nature \nof  the  works  involved,  on  the  need  to  enable  reasonable \ncompetition in the bidding, and on minimizing the PMU's contract \nadministration and management burden. The Project proposes a \ndesign\u2013build\u2013operate  contract  for  the  main  sewerage  system \nrehabilitation works to ensure an integrated system design and \nsustained  operation  of  the  rehabilitated  system.  The  draft \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n   \nConsulting Services  An estimated 1,007 person-months (77 international, 930 national) \nof  consulting  services  are  required  to  facilitate  project \nmanagement  and  implementation,  and  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional and operational capacity of CMC. The PMU will recruit \ntwo  consulting  firms  for  (i)  design,  supervision,  and  project \nmanagement  support  to  PMU  and  PIU;  and \n(ii)  institutional  development,  financial  and  operational \nimprovement support to the PMU and CMC. The consulting firms \nwill  be  recruited  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit about 645,000 residents in Greater \nBeneficiaries  Colombo by providing them with better wastewater management \nservices, with a resulting improvement in the urban environment, \nhealth, living conditions, and productivity of the residents. A total \nof 1.5 million residents in Greater Colombo will benefit indirectly \nfrom a better urban environment. The Project will have significant \nnet positive environmental impacts, including better marine and \ninland water quality and consequently improved public hygiene \nand  sanitary  conditions.  The  Project  will  involve  no  significant \ninvoluntary resettlement or impacts on indigenous peoples. The \nProject will improve the governance, finance, and service delivery \nof  the  municipal  service  provider  by  supporting  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity development.  \n   \n \n \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project\u2019s main risks are (i) a start-up delay and slow project \nimplementation  because  of  the  limited  experience  of  CMC  in \nimplementing an ADB project of this scale, and (ii) a possible lack \nof  sustainability  in  recovering  the  cost  of  operation  and \nmaintenance and debt services.  \n \nThe risk of a start-up delay and slow project implementation will \nbe  mitigated  by  the  early  establishment  of  the  PMU  and  the \nrecruitment of qualified staff. A capacity development technical \nassistance  project  will  provide  support  to  prepare  for  project \nimplementation,  and  this  will  be  followed  up  by  the  design, \nsupervision,  and  management  consultants  during  the  Project \nimplementation period. \n \nThe  sustainability  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  a  combination  of \nmeasures.  The  Project  introduces  a  design\u2013build\u2013operate \ncontract that will increase the predictability of the technical and \nbudgetary  requirements,  helping  CMC  to  put  in  place  the \nnecessary O&M budget in a planned manner. The Project also \nsupports  CMC  to  strengthen  its  institutional,  operational,  and \nfinancial capacity, including (i) building up and implementing a \ncost-recovery mechanism; (ii) introducing an asset management\nsystem; (iii) implementing a performance budgeting system; (iv) \ncreating a dedicated accounting code and an exclusive budget \nline for sewerage operations; and (v) institutionalizing a customer \ndatabase and services, all of which will contribute to enhancing \nthe sustainability of wastewater services delivery.   \n \nAs  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  assumes  a \nfundamental  increase  in  revenue  from  property  tax  or  other \nrevenue sources, an assurance is given by the Government and \nthe implementing agencies that they will increase their revenues \nto achieve cost recovery.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "80 o 00'E 80 o 00'E 81 o 30'E\nNational Capital P a l k     S t r a i Jtaffna KankaKsoadnitkuarmaiam Bay  o f  Bengal\nProvincial Capital Kilinochchi\nP a l k     B a y\nDistrict \nMullaittivu\nCity/Town\nTanniyuttu\nNational Highway Talaimannar\nMankulam\nNational Road 7 o 00'N NORTHERN 7 o 00'N\nRoad Mannar Puliyankulam\nRailway Vavuniya\nGulf  of \nRiver\nMannar\nDistrict Boundary Horowupotana Trincomalee\nCity/Municipal Boundary\nAnuradhapura\nProvincial Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Greater  Colombo  Wastewater \nManagement Project.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s economy has grown at an average of 5% per annum over the past 30 years.2 \nPer capita income has increased more than four times from $431 in 1990 to $2,016 in 2008. \nAlongside this economic growth, the country has experienced continuing urbanization, reflected \nin the size of the urban population and the extent of the urban areas.3 The urban population was \nestimated to be about 6 million in 2006, 30% of the national total, and it is growing at 3% per \nyear, compared with a national growth rate of 1.1%. Urban migration caused by the prolonged \nconflict and low productivity in rural areas has contributed to this trend. Despite this process, the \nurban  infrastructure  and  services  are  limited,  fail  to  meet  demands,  and  do  not  support \neconomic or social needs.4   \n \n3.  Sector Performance. In its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  (Government)  identified  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nadequate  sanitation  as  priority  objectives.  The  Government  has  set  targets  for  2015  of  \n(i) increasing the proportion of households with sustainable access to safe drinking water to \n86%, and (ii) increasing the proportion of the population with access to improved sanitation to \n93%. While a recent government report5 indicated that Sri Lanka will meet the MDG targets for \nwater supply and sanitation services, the condition of water supply and sanitation services is still \na concern. The coverage of piped water is still very low (30%). Even in the capital region, only \nabout 60% of the population is connected to piped water and only 50% has a continuous supply \nof piped water. In provincial urban areas, coverage is in the range of 5-20%, with an intermittent \nsupply of water for about 16 hours a day. \n \n4.  Although the country is reported to have made substantial progress in increasing the \npopulation with access to sanitation from 69% in 1990 to 91% in 2004,6 only 3% of the total \npopulation is connected to the public sewerage system. The vast majority of urban residents \nrely on septic tanks or have no private sanitation facilities. The existing infrastructure is grossly \ninadequate  and  malfunctioning.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  sanitation  has  been \nneglected; of the total investment in the water and sanitation sector during last two decades, \nless than 5% was spent on sanitation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Greater Colombo encompasses seven local authorities: three municipal councils (Colombo, Dehiwela/Mt Lavinia, \nSri Jayawardhenapura-Kotte), two urban councils, and two pradeshiya sabhas (smallest political unit in periurban \nor rural areas).  \n2  While Sri Lanka\u2019s economy remained relatively resilient in 2008, growing at 6%, its growth is forecast to fall to \nabout 4.5% in 2009 due to the weakening economic and financial outlook affected by the deepening global \nrecession. The International Monetary Fund approved a $2.6 billion loan in 2009 to support the economic reform \nprogram, strengthen the country\u2019s fiscal position, and support its post-conflict reconstruction and relief efforts. \n3  Sri Lanka had a relatively high population density of 308 people per square kilometer in 2008, one of the highest \nafter India among ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n4  Sri Lanka\u2019s public investment in infrastructure has been low for two reasons: first, the Government lacked the fiscal \nheadroom to increase investments; second, Sri Lanka's increasingly complex political economy makes formulating \nand implementing decisions difficult. \n5   Department of Census and Statistics. 2008.

The \nindicators and figures differ depending on sources. ", "2  \n5.  Sector Institutions. Water supply and sanitation services in Sri Lanka are provided by \nboth central and local governments. In 1974, a central government agency, the National Water \nSupply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), was established and several urban water supply and \nsanitation schemes operated by local authorities were transferred to it. The NWSDB became \nthe  primary  implementing  agency  for  publicly-financed  development  projects  in  the  sector. \nHowever, the Government\u2019s decentralization policy, supported by the thirteenth amendment to \nthe Constitution in 1987, drove NWSDB to return municipal services to local authorities and \ndevolve its role in investment and operation of water supply and sanitation services to local \nauthorities.  Most  local  authorities  have  been  reluctant  to  take  over  these  responsibilities \nbecause of their limited institutional and financial capacity. Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) is \nthe only municipal council to provide comprehensive sewerage and sanitation services within its \njurisdiction.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities7 \n1.  Challenges in Wastewater Management in Greater Colombo \n6.  Greater Colombo. Colombo is Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and administrative center. The \nGovernment, in its Ten-Year Development Framework, 2006-2016,8 targets high and steady \neconomic growth and modernization of the capital city and its environs as the national growth \nengine. The Western Region Physical Structure Plan,9 adopted by the Government as the \ndevelopment  plan  for  the  country\u2019s  capital  region,  emphasizes  the  critical  role  of  basic \ninfrastructure  and  services,  including  wastewater  management,  in  supporting  economic \ndevelopment and improving the quality of life in the Greater Colombo area.  \n \n7.  Inadequate  Sewerage  Infrastructure  and  Services.  While  Colombo  is  rapidly \nexpanding, coverage of the public sewerage network is limited. The wastewater master plan10 \nestimated that 66% of the Greater Colombo population was served by on-site facilities, 19% by \nthe  public  sewerage  system,11 and  15%  was  not  served  by  any  facilities.  People  without \nfacilities disposed of their wastewater on the seashore, in canals, and waterways, and on \navailable open ground. \n \n8.  The existing public sewerage network in Greater Colombo covers the area in CMC, \nDehiwela/Mount  Lavinia,  and  Kolonnawa,  which  have  a  resident  population  of  more  than \n838,000 and a floating population of more than 500,000. The sewerage system comprises  \n(i) about 320 kilometers (km) of sewers,12 (ii) 18 pumping stations within two catchments\u2014north \nand south, and (iii) two sea outfalls.13 Built between 1906 and 1920, and substantially rebuilt and \nexpanded in the 1980s,14 the system needs urgent repair, upgrading and expansion. The sewer \npipes suffer from blockages and collapses. One third of pumping facilities are broken, causing \n                                                 \n7  A problem and constraint analysis is in Appendix 2. An analysis of the sector is in Appendix 3. \n8  Department of National Planning. 2006. Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka, A Ten Year Horizon \nDevelopment Framework 2006\u20132016. Colombo. \n9  CESMA. 2004. Regional Structure Plan of the Western Region Megapolis. Colombo. \n10  Engineering Science. 1993. Wastewater Master Plan for Greater Colombo. Colombo.   \n11  It is estimated that in 2007 coverage of public sewerage system had expanded to about 25% of Greater Colombo. \n12 About 80% are small diameter (less than 300 mm) in clay and, more recently, polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Sewers up \nto 375 mm are glazed stoneware and those 450-600 mm are concrete. Force mains are often cast iron with lead \njoints.  \n13  One is in the northern part of Colombo at Mutwal: a 1,500-mm diameter and 2,053-m long outfall capturing the \nsewers from the northern catchment through the junction box in Madampityia pumping station. The other is in the \nsouthern part of Colombo at Wellawatta: a 1,500-mm diameter and 1,394-m long outfall capturing the sewers from \nCMC's southern catchment and the NWSDB's Dehiwala/Mt Lavinia systems through the junction box at Wellawatta \npumping station. \n14 The World Bank and the Saudi Fund financed the rehabilitation and expansion works. ", "             3 \nfrequent overflow to other water courses. One of the sea outfalls is breached in the middle and \nits diffusers are not functional.15 \n \n9.  Operation and Maintenance. Most of the system is old, exceeding its technical life, \ninefficient  and  unreliable,  incurring  high  power  cost.  Frequent  blockages  by  silt  and  other \nobstructions damage de-gritting equipment and pumps. There is no preventive maintenance or \nplanned replacement; instead, emergency repairs have become the normal practice and these \ncan only take place if emergency funds are available. Assets are not usually inventoried and \nthere is no accurate database on the condition of assets. Operational and maintenance works \nare  not  systematically  recorded.  The  customer  database  is  inaccurate  and  not  regularly \nupdated.  A  strategy  for  system  management  needs  to  address  these  operational  and \nmanagerial problems, along with the introduction of a planned maintenance system, an energy \naudit, and other operational efficiency enhancement mechanisms.  \n \n10.   Institutional Framework and Capacity. The poor infrastructure and service delivery in \nthe Greater Colombo sewerage system also stems from an inadequate institutional framework \nand the weak capacity of service providers. There has been lack of clarity concerning the role of \nthe two key institutions involved in the wastewater management services, NWSDB and CMC, \nand ambiguity about their ownership of assets.16 An ambiguous institutional framework led to \nover a decade of ineffective management and low accountability. After a legal opinion by the \nattorney general on asset ownership in 2007, CMC is confirmed as the owner as well as \noperator of the sewerage system within the Colombo municipality. NWSDB remains the asset \nowner and service provider outside Colombo municipality. CMC has moderate organizational \ncapacity, skills, and management tools and these need to be substantially improved. \n \n11.  Financial  Constraints.  The  financial  resources  obtained  through  local  tax  and \nGovernment subsidies are insufficient for CMC and NWSDB to make new investments, or even \nto  meet  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  sewerage  operations  of  both  have \nincurred  deficits  in  recent  years,  which  has  prevented  them  from  sustaining  regular  asset \nreplacements,  leading  to  poor  service  delivery.  While  NWSDB  has  recently  introduced  a \nsewerage tariff within its operational jurisdiction,17 thereby securing a dedicated account for \nwastewater  services,  the  sewerage  operation  in  CMC  is  not  delineated  from  the  drainage \noperation. Expenditures are met out of allocations from the general budget of the institution and \nthere is no independent accounting of revenue and expenditure for sewerage operations.  \n \n12.  Service  Regulation  and  Monitoring. Current sewerage operational practices18 and \nuncontrolled  industrial  effluent  discharges  into  public  sewers  raise  serious  environmental \nconcerns and there is no mechanism in place to monitor water quality or to make service \nproviders  comply  with  regulatory  standards.  Environmental  regulations  prescribed  by  the \nCentral Environmental Authority are not properly monitored or complied with. Service providers \n                                                 \n15  It is based on comprehensive assessment made in 1999, and confirmed by visual inspection undertaken in 2007 \nas part of ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Preparing the \nGreater Colombo Wastewater Project. Manila (TA 4531-SRI). \n16  Asset ownership has long been believed to belong to NWSDB, in accordance with the voluntary transfer order in \n1996 under the Section 64(1) of the NWSDB Law. However, this turned out to be invalid because of the absence of \nParliamentary approval. The attorney general issued a legal opinion in September 2007 that CMC was the legal \nowner of the sewerage assets within the CMC area, a determination that was acknowledged by the concerned \nagencies. \n17  The introduction of a sewerage charge was approved by the cabinet in September 2002. Subsequently the \nNWSDB board approved a sewerage tariff policy and a specific tariff structure which the minister of water supply \nand drainage also approved. Notification of a new sewerage tariff was gazetted in October 2007 and charging of \nsewerage tariff started in March 2008. As part of the system computerization at NWSDB, the form of the water bill \nwas modified and the sewerage charge has been incorporated into the water bill.  \n18 Because of malfunctioning of sewerage pumping stations and frequent collapses of the sewer pipes, the system \noperator often resorts to emergency bypass arrangements for discharging to the surface water.  \n ", "4  \nhave  little  accountability  for  the  quality,  quantity,  timeliness,  and  reliability  of  the  services \nprovided. There is no institutionalized system to check the performance of wastewater service \nproviders regularly or to benchmark their performance against predetermined standards.  \n \n2.  External Assistance and Lessons \n  \n13.  External Assistance. Appendix 4 contains a summary of past and ongoing external \nassistance to the water supply and sanitation sector in Sri Lanka. In recent years, ADB and the \ngovernment of Japan have been the major development partners in water supply and sanitation \nin  the  urban  sector.  In  rural  areas,  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  have  supported  community \nparticipation in water and sanitation for over a decade. In Greater Colombo, the World Bank and \nSaudi Fund supported rehabilitation of the sewerage system in 1980s and 1990s and the \ngovernments of Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden are currently providing financial and \ntechnical support. While the past and ongoing development supports by other development \npartners have improved parts of the sewerage system in Greater Colombo, rehabilitation of \nmajor works, including 17 pumping stations and the two outfalls, remains a major necessity.  \n \n14.  Lessons. Lessons drawn from ADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 operations in Sri \nLanka in the water and sanitation sector19 include: (i) outcomes of physical investments can only \nbe sustained if they are accompanied by well-programmed capacity building and institutional \nstrengthening; (ii) handover of management of water schemes to local authorities requires \ncontinued support during the transition and follow-up period; (iii) capacity development efforts \nneed to include not only technical aspects of O&M but also planning and financial management; \n(iv) continued efforts are needed to improve self-financing performance through implementation \nof sector reforms, covering cost recovery and commercial discipline of service agencies; and  \n(v)  institutional  arrangements  should  lead  to  broader  participation,  such  as  through  public \nawareness programs and capacity building activities for end-users. These lessons have been \nincorporated into the design of the Project.20  \n \n3.  Rationale: Sector Strategy and Opportunities \n \n15.  Government\u2019s  Sector  Strategy.  Safe  water  supply  and  adequate  sanitation  are \npriorities  in  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  national  development  strategies.  The \nspecific goals of the Government include: (i) access to adequate sanitation provided to 93% of \nthe population of Sri Lanka by 2015, (ii) piped sewerage systems provided in major urban areas \nand selected growth centers, and (iii) standard on-site sanitation made available to all not \ncurrently connected to a sewerage system or sanitation scheme. In addition, the Government\u2019s \nstrategy highlights the importance of strengthening the financial sustainability and institutional \ncapacity of key sector agencies, including NWSDB and local authorities, in order to achieve \nsector goals. \n \n16.  Decentralized Municipal Services. The Government\u2019s decentralization policy promotes \ndevolution of responsibility for municipal services in order to enhance accountability and build \nsustainability  in  service  delivery.  Local  authorities  will  require  substantial  capacity  building \nsupport if they are to perform their devolved mandates, including (i) enhancing skills for planning \nand asset management, (ii) making service delivery more accountable and improving customer \nrelations,  (iii)  improving  revenue  and  financial  management  to  recover  the  cost  of  service \n                                                 \n19 The lessons are extracted from various sources: ADB. 2008.

", "             5 \nprovision,  (iv)  introducing  performance  monitoring  and  management  systems,  and  \n(v) improving compliance with the existing legal and regulatory framework.  \n \n17.  Colombo  is  the  only  municipal  council  in  Sri  Lanka  providing  integrated  sewerage \nservices within its jurisdiction. As it has recently been determined to be the owner of assets of \nthe  sewerage  system  within  Colombo  (para.  10),  CMC  is  now  responsible  for  fulfilling  its \nmandates to manage the assets and execute capital investment, as well as to operate and \nmaintain the system and deliver sewerage services to its customers. The Project will help CMC \nto do this by improving wastewater management services in Colombo and its suburban area, \nupgrading the sewerage infrastructure, and providing institutional strengthening and capacity \ndevelopment support.21  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The expected impact of the Project is an improved urban environment and better public \nhealth for 1.5 million urban and suburban residents in Greater Colombo through improved \nmarine and inland water quality and a resulting improvement in hygiene and sanitary conditions. \nThe expected outcome of the Project is improved wastewater management services provided to \nabout 645,000 residents within the Project area through upgraded sewerage infrastructure and \nenhanced institutional and operational capacity of the service provider.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n19.  The Project has three components. Component 1 will upgrade sewerage infrastructure, \nincluding  rehabilitating  the  main  sewerage  system  in  Greater  Colombo.  Component  2  will \nstrengthen the institutional and operational capacity for (i) asset management planning and  \noperations,  (ii)  financial  management,  (iii)  operational  performance  monitoring,  \n(iv) environmental compliance, (v) customer services and public awareness, and (vi) pro-poor \nand gender-inclusive sanitation services. Component 3 will improve project management and \nimplementation as part of a comprehensive program of capacity building at wastewater service \nproviders. \n \n1.  Component 1: Upgrading Sewerage Infrastructure  \n20.  Rehabilitation of Main Sewerage System. This subcomponent will (i) rehabilitate 17 \npumping stations in the area covered by CMC, Kolonnawa and Dehiwela/Mt. Lavinia,22 including \nthe provision of new coarse screens and grit removal facilities, flow meters and emergency \ngenerators; (ii) lay four new pumping mains connecting the pumping stations;23 and (iii) install \npre-treatment equipment in the form of fine screens and associated screens, washing facilities, \n                                                 \n21 The Project has been in preparation since 2004. A chronology is in Supplementary Appendix A .  \n22This includes: (i) new construction of 4 pumping stations in Bambalapitiya, Borella, Maligawatta, and New Fort; (ii) \nfull refurbishment of 4 pumping stations in St. Jones Market (CS-3), Harbour, Thimbirigasyaya, and Wanathamulla; \n(iii)  partial  refurbishment  of  3  pumping  stations  in  Slave  Islands,  Polwatta,  and  Vyswyke;  and  (iv)  partial \nrefurbishment  of  6  pumping  stations  in  Dehiwala,  Mt. Lavinia, Kolonnawa  (KSP  1),  Wellampitiya  (KSP  2), \nMeethotamulla (KSP 3), and KSP 4. Pumping stations listed in (i) through (iii) are in CMC service area, and those \nlisted in (iv) are in NWSDB service area.  \n23 This includes  (i) Bambalapitiya/Wellawatta (Marine drive), (ii) New Fort/CS-3, (iii) Harbour/Madampititya, and (iv) \nVyswyke/Madampitiya. \n ", "6  \nand  sludge  disposal  facilities  at  two  downstream  pumping  stations,  immediately  prior  to \ndischarge through the sea outfalls.24  \n \n21.  Rehabilitation of Gravity Sewers. This subcomponent will (i) relay 10 km of critical \nsewers; and (ii) refurbish existing sewers by replacing control valves and supplying equipment, \nconstruction, testing, commissioning, providing as-built drawings and operational manuals, and \ntraining.  This  subcomponent  will  be  implemented  after  a  comprehensive  sewer  condition \nassessment is completed and critical sewer networks are identified and reconfirmed through a \nhydraulic survey by the design, supervision, and management consultants.  \n \n22.  Rehabilitation  of  Marine  Outfalls.  This  subcomponent  will  repair  the  two  marine \noutfalls discharging the sewage collected from each northern and southern catchment, including \n(i) major repairs to the northern outfall, which is currently breached in the middle, (ii) installation \nof new diffusers and fitting of access covers at the northern outfall, (iii) provision of access \npoints to the maintenance hole and unblocking of 14 outlet ports at the southern outfall, and  \n(iv) cleaning of grit at both outfalls.  \n \n23.  Supply  of  Operational  Equipment.  This  subcomponent  will  provide  operational \nequipment  to  assist  CMC  to  carry  out  key  O&M  tasks,  including  (i)  clearing  blockages;25  \n(ii)  sewer  inspection  to  check structural conditions,  causes  of  blockages, infiltration,  illegal \nconnections, and interconnection of sewer and storm water;26 and (iii) routine maintenance, \nsuch as the removal of deposited sediments as a result of shallow gradients and low flows.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Strengthening Institutional and Operational Capacity27  \n24.  Asset Management Planning and Operations. To enhance the sustainability of the \ncapital  investments,  the  Project  proposes  to  introduce  (i)  a  new  sewerage  management \ninformation system  that  will store all  data  relating  to sewerage  service  provision  centrally;  \n(ii) an associated asset management and stock inventory system, including a database with \nregular updates on the condition of the assets;28 and (iii) a work planning system that enables \nthe planned maintenance of the sewerage assets using the recorded asset database. These \nchanges will be best effected if the management and the operation functions are separated, with \nappropriate checks and balances. The Project will support the introduction and implementation \nof these changes in CMC\u2019s wastewater management system and will assist CMC to establish a \nseparate management unit apart from the existing operational unit.29  \n \n25.  To  support  asset  management  planning  and  establish  a  well-prioritized  capital \ninvestment program in the project area, the Project will also support the preparation of a \nstrategic sewer network model30 and an update of the wastewater master plan.31 This plan will \n                                                 \n24  Fine screens, washing facilities and digesters will be installed in the Madampitiya and Wellawatta pumping stations \nto ensure removal of all suspended particulate matter of size 3 mm and above, subject to verification of their design \nby the design, supervision, and management consultants and endorsement by CMC and ADB. \n25 A mobile jetting and vacuum lorry, a jetting trailer, and a bowser lorry will be provided to clear blockages. \n26 A mobile CCTV sewer inspection unit will be provided. \n27 Component 2 targets strengthening CMC\u2019s institutional and operational capacity, as asset owner and service \nprovider for main sewerage system in Colombo. The subcomponents are designed to address the identified \ninstitutional and operational constraints based on the findings from the problem analysis in Appendix 2. \n28 The asset condition will be regularly updated by the operational team by encoding routine maintenance records \nand CCTV survey results of underground pipes. \n29 The existing organizational structure of CMC for sewerage management is focused on operations. Now that CMC \nis mandated to discharge its mandate as asset owner of the sewerage system, a separate unit dedicated to \nmanaging the assets will be established with the assistance of an institutional development consultant.  \n30 Sewer network modeling includes (i) completion of Greater Colombo's sewers map digitization to expedite \noperational and maintenance activities; (ii) development of a strategic hydraulic model that will enable identification ", "             7 \nincorporate  updated  demand  forecasts,  based  on  urbanization  trends  and  the  Colombo \ndevelopment plan. It will propose the required capacities in the sewerage system and the \ninvestment required to improve the system. The plan will also cover a progressive expansion of \nthe public sewerage system to underserved areas and proposals for secondary wastewater \ntreatment in Greater Colombo.32  \n \n26.  Financial  Management.  The  Project  will  support  CMC  to  improve  the  financial \nmanagement of sewerage operations with a view to sustaining the operations of the upgraded \nsewerage system. This will include (i) building up and implementing a cost-recovery mechanism \nfollowing a time-bound implementation plan; (ii) creating a dedicated budget line and accounting \ncode for sewerage operations to ring-fence the fund flow and accounting related to sewerage \nservices; (iii) incorporating financial planning into the corporate plan; and (iv) introducing a \nperformance budgeting system where the operational and financial performance is monitored \nand reported, and eventually costs and inputs are determined by the target outputs on the basis \nof technical and financial performance indicators. \n \n27.  Operational and Monitoring Capacity. As part of measures to strengthen operational \ncapacity,  the  Project  will  support  the  drafting  and  implementation  of  standard  operational \npractices, a preventive maintenance plan, a health and safety manual, and an emergency plan. \nThe Project will also develop procedures for managing and monitoring (i) illegal connections,  \n(ii) flooding of properties, (iii) sewer blockages and collapses, (iv) stores replenishment, and  \n(v) energy and environmental auditing.  \n \n28.  Environmental Compliance. The Project will support CMC in monitoring and complying \nwith environmental regulatory standards. This will include (i) establishing a quality monitoring \nmechanism for discharge to inland, coastal, and marine waters; (ii) providing water quality \nmonitoring equipment and consumables; (iii) building a mechanism for pollution source control, \nmonitoring, and enforcement of pretreatment before discharging to sewer network; (iv) legal \narrangements for interagency sewer discharge;33 (v) preparation of a septage management plan \nfor underserved areas and pumping stations; and (vi) establishing arrangements for processing \nand disposing of sludge and screenings at the pumping stations. \n \n29.  Customer Services and Public Awareness. The Project will support CMC to build a \ncustomer database and a customer services manual. To complement active customer relations, \na framework will be developed to assess the performance of services delivery by CMC. A \nwastewater services outreach program will be conducted to improve understanding among \ncustomers and the public. In addition to information on the Project\u2019s components, benefits and \nimplementation  schedule,  the  campaign  will  aim  to  improve  public  awareness  on  (i)  the \nenvironment and public health in relation to sanitation; (ii) the operational costs needed to \nprovide a service and associated service charges; (iii) links between water consumption and \nwastewater generation; and (iv) the consequences of solid waste disposal into open canals or \nmaintenance holes. The campaign will also provide an opportunity to disseminate information \nrelating to customer inquiries and customer support.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nof critical sewers, optimization of the operational regime of the pumps, and an assessment of the risk of silting; and \n(iii) procurement of hardware and software to run a model. \n31 A sewerage master plan was first prepared in 1981 and last updated in 1993. \n32 At present, a sewage treatment plant is being considered for possible construction by 2020. Land for future \ntreatment works will be reserved near the Mutwal and Wellawatta outfalls. The Project will conduct feasibility \nstudies on the preferred treatment process and on the preliminary design of the sewage treatment works at the \nproposed locations. \n33 The Greater Colombo sewerage system has cross-boundary flows of wastewater at the boundaries between the \nCMC and NWSDB service areas, which require an agreement between two parties. A draft memorandum of \nunderstanding on interagency sewer discharge is attached in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n ", "8  \n30.  Pro-poor and Gender-inclusive Sanitation Services. Building on the draft poverty \nreduction strategy developed by CMC, the Project complements and institutionalizes CMC's on-\ngoing  efforts  in  its  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  sanitation  services.  It  will  support  \n(i) comprehensive research on previous and ongoing pilot sanitation schemes in low-income \nareas, and lessons to be drawn from such schemes; (ii) providing inputs to the Greater Colombo \nwastewater master planning from the pro-poor sanitation services perspectives; (iii) setting up a \nstrategy of pro-poor sanitation services to form part of CMC's poverty reduction strategy and \ninstitutionalizing  the  implementation  of  such  strategy;  (iv)  preparing  a  proposal  on  future \ninvestment requirements in accordance with the strategy; (v) recording underserved settlements \ndata into the current geographic information system database; and (vi) piloting alternative and \nunconventional on-site sanitation in selected low-income areas.34 \n \n3.  Component 3: Project Management and Implementation Support  \n31.  This  component  will  support  project  management  and  implementation,  including \nincremental administration and operations associated with the project management unit (PMU) \nand  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  and  implementation  of  the  capacity  development \nprogram. Consulting services will be provided to the PMU for the design and supervision of \nsewerage infrastructure works, including a preliminary design for future treatment plants and an \nexpansion of the sewerage system to underserved areas. Support will also be provided in \nproject management and implementation on technical, environmental and social aspects and \nplanning and monitoring in accordance with ADB policy and guidelines.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  Sustainability  Embedded  in  the  Contract.  The  Project  provides  a  large  capital \ninvestment and it is essential to ensure the sustainability of this investment. In parallel with \ninstitutional and operational support for CMC, the Project proposes a consolidated contract \ncombining design, construction and O&M. The merits of this consolidated  contract are to  \n(i) provide incentives to the contractor to take an integrated approach in the system\u2019s design, \nincluding consideration of O&M; (ii) indirectly enhance the quality of construction by extending \nthe contractor's responsibility beyond the commissioning stage; (iii) provide continuity in system \noperation while the construction is ongoing; (iv) increase the predictability of the system in terms \nof technical and budgetary requirements; (v) involve CMC staff for a sufficient transition period \nbefore  they  take  full  responsibility;  and  (vi)  secure  an  adequate  O&M  budget  based  on \ncontractual requirements. The key features of the contract are described in Supplementary \nAppendix C and the outline structure is summarized in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n33.  The project investment cost is estimated at $116.6 million, including taxes and duties of \n$16.5 million.

The  Government  has  requested  loans  of  $100  million  equivalent\u2014$80  million  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and $20 million equivalent from the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) to help finance the Project. The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, (the \ninterest and fee during the grace period will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADF loan will have a 32-\nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period.  The  ADF  loan  will  finance  part  of \nsewerage infrastructure upgrading, sewerage master planning including an investment plan for \nan expansion of sewerage to underserved areas, institutional capacity strengthening support for \nservice delivery and project management support, and CMC\u2019s institutionalization of its pro-poor \nsanitation  services  in  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  pilot  schemes.35 The  Government \ncounterpart  funds  will  finance  the  full  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  and  the  temporary \nresettlement cost.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank       \nOrdinary Capital Resources  80.0   68.6  \nAsian Development Fund  20.0   17.1  \nGovernment  16.6   14.3a  \nTotal  116.6   100.0  \na     The Government's share of the cost is in line with the country cost sharing ceiling.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n35 While the Project is entitled to larger amount of ADF loan considering its non-revenue generating aspects and its \nimpact on the environment and public health, the proportion of the ADF loan is set relatively low because of the \nfinancial constraints facing ADF resources. The Government agreed to borrow the balance from the OCR loan \nduring the country programming for the Sri Lanka country partnership strategy in 2008. \n ", "10  \n \n35.  The Government will pass on the ADB loan proceeds to each of CMC and NWSDB as a \nblend of grant (82.5%) and loan (17.5%). The relending terms for the loan portion will be at the \nrate of 10% per annum with a repayment period of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years. \nThe Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Provincial  Councils  (MLGPC)  will  be  the \nexecuting agency. CMC will be the implementing agency for most activities, except for the \npumping station rehabilitation works within the NWSDB service area,36 for which NWSDB will be \nthe implementing agency. The PMU will be established within CMC directly under the municipal \ncommissioner, led by a CMC officer at senior management level for the duration of the Project. \nA small PIU will be established under NWSDB to implement the works for the NWSDB service \narea. The PMU will be staffed by members of CMC, together with staff to be recruited on a \ncontract basis. The staffing requirements for the PMU will consider both incremental staff for the \nimplementation  and  construction  phases  and  the  long-term  O&M  function  of  CMC.  The \nGovernment, CMC, and NWSDB have agreed to provide adequate staff for the PMU and PIU, \nwhich should be acceptable to ADB. In order to help CMC to set up the PMU structure and \nmanage the preparatory works for Project implementation, a project management support team \nwill be engaged, funded by ADB capacity development technical assistance (CDTA).37 The \nCDTA will support project preparatory activities and initial training and capacity building of CMC \nto improve Project readiness and kick-start project implementation immediately after the Project \nbecomes effective.  \n \n37.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be established  to  oversee  the  Project  and \nprovide policy guidance and coordination among the Government agencies involved in the \nadministrative process of the Project. 38 The PSC, chaired by the secretary of MLGPC, will hold \nquarterly meetings, or as often as necessary.  \n \n38.  The PMU will have four different units: (i) engineering, (ii) monitoring and evaluation,  \n(iii) institutional development, and (iv) finance and administration.39 The key functions of the \nPMU will be (i) preparing the overall project implementation plan and consolidated annual work \nplan;  (ii)  recruiting  consultants  and  procuring  goods  and  works,  in  compliance  with  ADB \nguidelines; (iii) implementing the proposed institutional strengthening and capacity development \nprogram under the Project; (iv) carrying out project performance and compliance monitoring, \nincluding  loan  covenants  and  safeguards  compliance;  (v)  administering  the  ADB  loan  in \naccordance  with  ADB  disbursement  guidelines;  (vi)  maintaining  project  documents  and \nsubmitting timely reports to ADB and the Government, including audit reports; (vii) obtaining \nnecessary environmental and developmental clearances; and (viii) disclosing project-related \ninformation and documents in accordance with ADB guidelines.

Implementation Period \n39.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years. Implementation is expected to begin in the \nfirst quarter of 2010 and end in December 2014. To prepare for project implementation, the \nPMU has been formed with a core staff. In addition, following start-up activities have been \ncompleted: (i) forming the PSC, and (ii) placing an advertisement inviting expressions of interest \nfrom the consultants. Other activities such as (i) establishing a fully functional PMU in the form \nof legalized independent project office; (ii) applying for permits, clearances, and approvals from \nvarious  competent  authorities;  (iii)  carrying  out  technical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  for \nwastewater services; and (iv) developing the capacity of the PMU staff will be undertaken before \nloan effectiveness. Recruitment of consultants will be completed before the third quarter of \n2010. Tendering of major civil works will begin 3 months after the consultants\u2019 mobilization and \nphysical  works  will  start  approximately  15  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n40.  Civil Works and Goods. Procurements to be financed by the Project will be carried out \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated to \ncost $3 million or more, and supply contracts valued at $500,000 or higher. Shopping will be \nused for contracts for procurement of works and equipment worth less than $100,000. An \nindicative  procurement  plan,  indicating  contract  packages  and  procurement  program,  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n41.  The size of procurement packages will depend on the nature of the works involved, on \nenabling  reasonable  competition  in  the  bidding,  and  on  minimizing  the  PMU's  contract \nadministration and management burden. The Project proposes a design\u2013build\u2013operate contract \nfor the main sewerage system rehabilitation works in order to ensure an integrated system \ndesign  and  sustained operation  of  the  rehabilitated  system.  The  procurement  plan  will  be \nupdated annually by the PMU for approval by ADB. \n \n42.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. Advance contracting of equipment, \nworks and recruitment of consultants is requested. The expenditures incurred for equipment, \nworks, and consulting services during the 12 months prior to signing of the loan agreements will \nbe eligible for retroactive financing of up to 20% of the proposed amount for the loans under the \nProject. In order to expedite project implementation, it is proposed that advance action be taken \nfor (i) recruitment of consultants; (ii) preparation of bidding documents for procurement of the \ndesign\u2013build\u2013operate contract package, the technical specifications of which will be upgraded \nby  the  consultants  once  they  are  mobilized;  (iii)  conduct  of  preliminary  surveys  and \ninvestigations; (iv) procurement of operational equipment; and (v) establishment and operation \nof the PMU and PIU offices and capacity building of newly recruited staff. The Government has \nbeen advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.    \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n43.  An estimated 1,007 person-months (77 international, 930 national) of consulting services \nare required to (i) facilitate project management and implementation, and (ii) strengthen the \n ", "12  \ninstitutional and operational capacity of CMC. The PMU will recruit two consulting firms: a \ndesign,  supervision,  and  management  consultant  (DSC)  and  an  institutional  development \nconsultant  (IDC).  The  consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection (QCBS) method with a standard quality:cost ratio of 80:20 in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The DSC will \ninclude  53  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  736  person-months  of  national \nexpertise.40 The IDC will include 24 person-months of international expertise and 194 person-\nmonths of national expertise.41 The proposed outline terms of reference for the DSC are in \nSupplementary Appendix E and the outline terms of reference for the IDC are in Supplementary \nAppendix F. Nongovernment organizations will also be recruited under the Project to support \nthe implementation of public awareness and community mobilization activities.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy will be included in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing and implementing \nagencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Project. \n \n45.  The Project will introduce additional specific measures to enhance governance and \ntransparency in relation to the Project implementation. These include (i) provision of consultant \nsupport to project implementation staff on procurement and financial management; (ii) support \nfor  information  technology  to  increase  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency;  \n(iii) implementation of procurement and performance audits; (iv) computerization of a financial \nreporting system and its networking among cost centers; (v) adherence to a code of conduct by \nmanagement and employees; (vi) random and independent spot checks by review missions on \nprocurement  and  project  accounts;  (vii)  public  disclosure  of  information  on  procurement \nprocedures and contract awards for the Project through the website of implementing agencies; \n(viii) institutionalization of a mechanism to redress grievances; and (ix) beneficiary involvement \nin project monitoring and evaluation.    \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  The PMU and PIU will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections, requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds, collecting supporting documents, and preparing \nwithdrawal applications and sending them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan \nproceeds and to expedite project implementation, the Government will, immediately after the \nloans are made effective, open and maintain three first-generation imprest accounts, one for the \nOCR loan and two for the ADF loan, with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the three second- \ngeneration imprest accounts, two for the PMU (one for the OCR loan and one for the ADF loan) \nand one for the PIU from ADF loan. The maximum ceiling of each first-generation imprest \naccount will not at any time exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures to be paid from \nthe imprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the respective loan amount from OCR and \n                                                 \n40  In addition, about 1,088 person-months of technical and support staff will also be engaged under the DSC. \n41  In addition, about 100 person-months of technical and support staff will also be engaged under the IDC. ", "             13 \nADF, whichever is lower. The maximum ceiling of each second-generation imprest account will \nbe equivalent to 6 months estimated expenditures to be funded from each second-generation \nimprest account or $1,000,000, whichever is lower. The PMU and PIU will be responsible for \nensuring that all imprest accounts are established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and with the detailed arrangements \nagreed by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will \nbe used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts. The maximum payment permitted \nunder the SOE for both second-generation imprest accounts is $100,000 per payment. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n47.  The Government will provide ADB with detailed quarterly progress reports on project \nimplementation, which will follow ADB's standard template and procedures. The PMU and PIU \nwill maintain separate project accounts for all expenditures incurred on the Project, whether \nfunded out of loan proceeds or counterpart funds. They will establish and maintain separate \nrecords for works, goods, and services financed out of loan proceeds.  \n \n48.  The Government and the MLGPC will cause the detailed consolidated project accounts, \nas  maintained  by  the  PMU  and  PIU,  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nstandards by the auditor general or independent auditors appointed by the auditor general \nacceptable to ADB. The audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end \nof the fiscal year by the PMU and PIU. The annual audit report will include a separate audit \nopinion on the use of the first-generation and second-generation imprest accounts and the SOE \nprocedure. The Government and the MLGPC have been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on \ndelayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited \naccounts. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n49.  To ensure that project components are managed efficiently and project benefits are \nmaximized, the PMU, with support and coordination by PIU, will establish a project performance \nmanagement system (PPMS) within 3 months of loan effectiveness. The PPMS, established in \naccordance with ADB's Project Performance Management System Handbook, will provide a \ncause-and-effect  relationship  between  the  Project  and  its  impact  and  will  be  updated  and \nreported quarterly. Project performance monitoring and evaluation will be based on the design \nand monitoring framework and the baseline surveys specified in it. Beneficiaries will be involved \nin project monitoring evaluation, through direct reporting to the PMU and PIU and through the \nPSC.  The  indicators  to  be  monitored  will  be  formulated  by  the  PMU  and  PIU,  including \nindicators pertaining to physical progress and institutional development activities. A separate set \nof performance indicators will be established for the design\u2013build\u2013operate contract for contract \nmonitoring. The PMU and PIU will gather baseline physical and socioeconomic data and submit \na  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  preparing  benchmark \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, \nthe PMU and PIU will submit semiannual monitoring and evaluation reports to ADB throughout \nproject implementation. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n50.  The Government and ADB will jointly assess project implementation semiannually. The \nGovernment, MLGPC, PMU, PIU, and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review 3 \nyears  after  the  Project  starts  or  after  construction  of  the  main  package  for  sewerage \nrehabilitation  has  been  initiated,  whichever  is  sooner.  The  reviews  will  (i)  examine  the \nappropriateness of scope, design, implementation arrangements and schedule of activities;  \n ", "14  \n(ii) identify changes needed since project appraisal; (iii) assess implementation performance \nagainst project indicators; (iv) review compliance with loan covenants; (v) identify problems, \nconstraints,  and,  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation \narrangements; and (vi) monitor the effectiveness of safeguard procedures. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, the PMU will make publicly available a project completion \nreport (PCR) in the standard ADB format. ADB will prepare its own PCR within 1 year of \nreceiving the Government\u2019s PCR. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n51.  Economic. Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth is largely dependent on Colombo and its ability \nto  attract  investment  and  increase  productivity.  Adequate  provision  of  urban  services  in \nColombo is one of the important elements for ensuring further investment and productivity. \nDespite rapid urbanization, the existing sewerage network in Greater Colombo is limited, and \nneeds to be expanded. However, no system expansion works can be undertaken unless critical \ndefects are repaired and higher operational efficiency is attained within the existing system. \nTherefore, the Project is focused on rehabilitating the existing sewerage system in preparation \nfor the future expansion of the public sewerage system to areas in Greater Colombo not yet \nserved. Alternative designs for rehabilitation were assessed during the feasibility study stage.42 \nThe technologies that were selected meet geographical restrictions, will be easy to maintain and \noperate, and will have low construction and maintenance costs.  \n \n52.  The Project is the first phase of large scheme that ultimately aims to expand sewerage \ncoverage in Greater Colombo. The Project's economic viability considered the future expansion \nof the sewerage system. The cost\u2013benefit analysis covers a 25-year period and uses 2009 \ndomestic prices. The result of the cost\u2013benefit analysis indicates that the economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) is 13.6%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital, indicating the \nreasonable economic viability of the Project. A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken under \nvarious adverse circumstances. The result indicates that the EIRR is most sensitive to the \nnumber  of  connections  achieved.  CMC  and  NWSDB  will  therefore  need  to  ensure  the \nsubsequent  expansion  of  the  Project  to  achieve  the  target  number  of  connections.  The \neconomic analysis is detailed in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n53.  Financial. The financial management assessment43 reveals that there is potential for \nboth CMC and NWSDB to strengthen their financial management. Both organizations suffer \nfrom vacancies in finance staff positions, which have affected timely completion of the accounts. \nTheir corporate planning is separate from financial planning. There are challenges specific to \neach organization. As the Project is the first large-scale project for CMC, its existing accounting \npractices may require modification,44 such as the introduction of depreciation to prepare for the \nreplacement of large capital assets, treatment of uncollectable payments, and a new accounts \ncode to capture the fund flow related exclusively to sewerage services. NWSDB needs to \nincrease efficiency in various areas. For example, financial reports from various regions are \n                                                 \n42 Alternative materials and excavation techniques were considered, such as use of ductile iron pipes or polyethylene \npipes, laid by open trench or using trenchless technology. Various sewer network configurations and locations of \nthe screening facilities were evaluated to achieve higher efficiency in light of practicalities for the required process. \nThe detailed analysis of alternative designs is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n43 Financial management assessment was conducted as part of financial analysis, as detailed in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n44 This will be subject to further assessment of capacity and required procedures for implementation. The institutional \ndevelopment consultant will support the implementation of suggestions to the extent that the current accounting \nstandards can accommodate them. ", "             15 \nmanually consolidated because there is no networked financial reporting system, and accounts \nreceivables are higher than the three-month sales because of low tariff collection.  \n \n54.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  was  assessed  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.45 As the Project is a nonrevenue generating \nproject, it is not appropriate to assess financial rate of return; instead the financial sustainability \nof the Project was assessed. With no incremental revenue from the Project, CMC and NWSDB \nwill have to finance their debt service and higher O&M costs from their existing revenues. \nCMC's revenue needs to be increased by SLRs370 million in real terms by 2014 to finance \nO&M and debt servicing costs.46 Revenue increases will be able to finance both the debt service \nand the O&M cost from 2015. NWSDB will have to increase the service charges by not less \nthan 3.5% per year in real terms. The financial analysis is detailed in Supplementary Appendix \nH. \n \n55.  Poverty  Impact.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  the  sewerage  infrastructure  and \nmanagement  services, which  will  contribute  to  achieving MDG  target  7.  The  public  health \nimpacts from the reduction of overflows, leaks and blockages will benefit the poor who often live \nin low-lying areas and near polluted inland waterways in Colombo. The Project also includes a \nsubcomponent  to  institutionalize  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  sanitation  services  in \nunderserved settlements in the CMC service area, and to pilot alternative and unconventional \non-site  sanitation  in  underserved  areas.  This  will  involve:  (i)  carrying  out  a  participatory \nconsultative process with beneficiaries to identify the most appropriate alternative sanitation \ntechnology; (ii) identifying the potential for community participation in implementation, operation, \nand maintenance of the sanitation facility; and (iii) assessing the possibility of extending the \npiloted approach to other municipal areas. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 10.   \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n56.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Project is classified as category B in accordance with \nADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Infrastructure works under the Project are limited \nto upgrading existing sewerage infrastructure within existing physical facilities. For rehabilitating \ngravity sewers, the construction will be undertaken through trenchless technology or open-cut.47 \nIn road alignments with four or more lanes, traffic can be managed to ensure that works will not \nresult  in  temporary  loss  of  access.  For  two-lane  roads,  there  may  be  potential  temporary \nimpacts related to access disruptions.48 The potential temporary impacts of open cuts would be \naccess  disruption  for:  (i)  residents,  (ii)  businesses  and  clients,  (iii)  vehicles,  and  \n(iv) institutions and clients. This disruption can be mitigated through good construction practices, \nwhich will be the responsibility of the construction contractors. In road alignments with no proper \naccess, there is a likelihood of temporary income loss for businesses and their employees. \n \n57.  The Project will not require permanent or temporary land acquisition. Based on transect \nwalks and confirmation from project preparation civil engineers, there will be no impacts on \npermanent structures or other assets. While it is estimated that there would be potential impacts \nfor an estimated 156 residential households in terms of access inconvenience, interviews show \n                                                 \n45 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n46 This can be a combined way of revising the annual rental value and increasing the property tax rate. \n47  The choice of technology will depend on a conditions survey, which will be undertaken as part of the Project. \nTrenchless technology will not have resettlement impacts, thus, as a conservative approach, the resettlement plan \nassumes that most sections will use open cut. \n48 Transect walks were conducted on two road sections totaling 1.25 km. During the transect walks, interview were \ncarried out with residents, businesses, employees, and institutions, supplemented by focus group discussions to \nestimate potential temporary impacts. \n ", "16  \nthat residents' livelihood will not be affected except when their businesses or employment are \naffected  by  access.  Residents  may  temporarily  lose  secure  parking  for  an  estimated  515 \nvehicles and businesses for 480 vehicles. An estimated 428 businesses and 1,340 employees \nmay experience partial income loss because of reduced client access.49 There is much potential \nto minimize impacts, through proper planning and implementation of mitigation measures, to a \nlevel that will not affect income. A summary short resettlement plan is attached in Appendix 11 \nand the short resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n58.  Indigenous  Peoples.  Screening  during  project  preparation  showed  no  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. The preparation of the resettlement plan also shows that there are no \nindigenous peoples among the affected people. The Project is classified as category C in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n59.  Environment.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) was carried out for the project subcomponents in the project \narea. The examination showed that none of the components would have any significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts and all impacts could be suitably mitigated. The only subcomponent \nrequiring greater attention is the continuous discharge of domestic wastewater to the marine \nenvironment. However, numerous modeling studies have indicated good mixing, dispersion, and \ncoliform die-off under most weather and tide conditions for both rehabilitated outfalls. The \nrehabilitation of the outfalls to, at least, their design specifications would be a considerable \nimprovement on the existing situation. Anticipated minor environmental impacts include some \nexcess soil generation due to excavation activities50 and greater noise, dust, and traffic during \nconstruction.51 The  short  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  12  and  the  summary  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. An environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared as part of \nthe IEE (Supplementary Appendix K) for the construction and operation phases, with adequate \nmitigation measures proposed to minimize impacts resulting from inadequate maintenance of \nsewerage  network.  Significant  environmental  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project  include  \n(i) improved hygiene and sanitary conditions, (ii) better sewage disposal, and (iii) a healthier \necosystem as a result of the reduction in the discharge of domestic wastes into surface water \nbodies.  \n \nC.  Risks \n60.  The  Project\u2019s  main  risks  are  (i)  a  start-up  delay  and  slow  Project  implementation \nbecause of the limited experience of CMC in implementing an ADB project of this scale, and  \n(ii) a possible lack of sustainability in recovering the cost of O&M and debt services.  \n \n61.  The risk of a start-up delay and slow Project implementation will be mitigated by the \nearly  establishment  of  the  PMU  and  the  recruitment  of  qualified  staff  supported  by  the \nconsultants.  The  CDTA  will  provide  upfront  support  to  prepare  for  project  implementation, \n                                                 \n49 One pipe section is 20 m long requiring a trench 1.5 m wide. By opening the trench one section at a time, the \ndisruption is estimated to be 5 days per 20 m section. \n50 Appropriate controls include clauses on the contractor\u2019s contract for criteria on predetermining areas prior to \nexcavation works, approving, and monitoring users of the excess spoil. The use should be limited for reclamation \npurposes, and should not be used in areas near wetlands or protected bodies of water. The IEE identifies \nmeasures to reduce potential negative impact in relation to the excavation works and transportation of soils.   \n51 Measures are identified in the IEE and include: (i) avoiding conducting noise-generating activities at night;   \n(ii) consulting with the local community to inform them of the nature, duration, and likely effects of the construction \nwork, and to identify any local concerns so that these can be addressed; (iii) reducing dust by spraying soil and \ncovering with tarpaulins; and (iv) utilizing modern vehicles and machinery with the requisite adaptations to limit \nnoise and exhaust emissions, and ensuring that these are maintained to manufacturers\u2019 specifications at all times. ", "             17 \nprovide  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  with  exposure  to  ADB  procedures,  and \nsupport the recruitment of the consultants.  \n \n62.  The sustainability risk will be mitigated by a combination of measures. The Project \nintroduces a design\u2013build\u2013operate contract that will increase the predictability of the technical \nand budgetary requirements, helping CMC to put in place the necessary O&M budget in a \nplanned manner. The Project also supports CMC to strengthen its institutional, operational, and \nfinancial  capacity,  including  (i)  building  up  and  implementing  a  cost-recovery  mechanism;  \n(ii)  introducing  an  asset  management  system;  (iii)  implementing  a  performance  budgeting \nsystem; (iv) creating a dedicated accounting code and an exclusive budget line for sewerage \noperations;  and  (v)  institutionalizing  a  customer  database  and  services,  all  of  which  will \ncontribute to enhancing the sustainability of wastewater services delivery. However, as the \nfinancial sustainability of the Project assumes a fundamental increase in revenue from property \ntax or other revenue sources, an assurance is given by the Government and the implementing \nagencies that they will target a revenue increase to achieve the cost recovery. This will need to \nbe backed by sustained political will.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n63.  In addition to the standard assurances, the following assurances have been given by the \nGovernment, the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils, Colombo Municipal \nCouncil,  and  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board.  These  assurances  will  be \nincorporated in the loan agreements and project agreements: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that each year during Project implementation, adequate \nbudgetary allocations of the required counterpart funds will be made to the Project by \nthe relevant authorities on a timely and regular basis. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that: (a) all land and right-of-way required for the Project \nare made available in a timely manner; (b) if any land acquisition or resettlement \nbecomes necessary, appropriate resettlement plan is prepared in consultation with \nthe affected people and in accordance with the Government's National Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  and  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995);  (c)  the \nresettlement activities will be carried out according to the resettlement plan agreed \nbetween the Government and the ADB which the Government will disclose to the \npublic; (d) an updated resettlement plan, to be disclosed to the public, will be provided \nto ADB for review, approval and ADB website disclosure following detailed designs \nand detailed measurement survey and prior to the award of any civil works contract; \n(e) any civil works will be commenced only after the required land has been acquired \nand affected households have been relocated and compensated at full replacement \ncost; (f) external monitoring reports are submitted to ADB to be uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite; (g) adequate budgetary support is made available to cover the costs of land \nacquisition and resettlement; and (h) resettlement activities will be carried out in line \nwith the Government's laws and ADB's policy and in case of discrepancy ADB's policy \nwill be applied. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that (a) the Project is carried out in compliance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  relevant  national  environmental  laws  and \nregulations; (b) the relevant environmental mitigation measures specified in the ADB-\napproved final EMP updated during detailed engineering design are incorporated in \nbidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts;  (c)  all  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements set out in the EMP will be implemented and complied with, \nrespectively,  and  closely  supervised  throughout  Project  implementation;  and  (d) \nproject environmental performance will be monitored, and the monitoring report will be \nsubmitted to ADB semiannually. \n ", "18  \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that (a) bidding documents include specific provisions to \nensure that civil works contractors will comply with core labor standards and labor \nlaws  and  gender  equal  pay  for  equal  work,  and  (b)  civil  works  contractors  will \ndisseminate information on sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS to their \nemployees and local communities surrounding the Project sites. \n(v)  The Government confirms that the sewerage asset within Colombo municipal area is \nowned by the CMC and the Government undertakes not to change the ownership of \nthe  asset  throughout  the  Project  period  by  executive  or  administrative  decree, \ndecision, resolution or such other or similar means either under the NWSDB Law or \nsuch other similar, or succeeding legislation. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  by  2014  CMC  will  have  effected  the  revenue \nincrease to the level to cover the O&M cost and debt service owed to the Government \nunder the Project and allocated such increased revenue for the O&M budget for \nsewerage operations in CMC service area.

Government\u2019s Targets \n1.  In support of its poverty reduction efforts and its commitments to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, the Government of Sri Lanka has identified improving access to safe \ndrinking water and adequate sanitation as priorities. Specific goals1 include (i) provision of \nsufficient and safe drinking water to 90% of the population by 2016; (ii) achievement of national \nstandards for service levels and quality of water in urban and rural areas; (iii) provision of \naccess to safe, adequate and improved sanitation facilities to 88% of the population by 2016; \n(iv) provision of piped sewerage systems in major urban areas and selected growth centers; and \n(v) availability of standard on-site sanitation for all not currently connected to a sewerage \nsystem or sanitation scheme. The existing scheme in Colombo has several deficiencies in \nservice  provision,  due  partly  to  physical  constraints,  but  more  importantly  to  financial \nshortcomings, problematic operations, poor asset management, and policy and institutional \nissues. \n \nB.  Access to Sewerage and Sanitation \n2.  Provision of sewerage services in Sri Lanka is limited to some areas of Greater Colombo \nand Hikkaduwa and covers about 3% of the total population. The Government has proposed \nthat services be expanded in Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna. The 1993 master plan2 estimated \nthat 66% of the Greater Colombo population was served by on-site sanitation facilities,3 19% by \nsewerage systems,4 and 15% had no facilities. The population without facilities, the urban poor, \ndisposes of their waste on the seashore, in canals and waterways and on available open \nground. In addition to the 15% without facilities there are substantial low-income settlements \nthat have access to limited facilities.  \n \nC.  Policy and Institutions  \n3.  Responsibility for policy making, regulation and development of the water and sewerage \nsector lies with the central government (Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage and the Ministry \nof Urban Development and Sacred Areas), while provincial councils and local authorities are \nresponsible for ensuring equitable resource allocation, quality, and standards of service under \nthe National Policy on Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector. Before 1975, the provision of \npiped water and public wells was mainly the responsibility of local authorities. In 1974, through \nan act of Parliament, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) was established \nas  the  primary  national  agency  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Subsequently \nseveral major urban water supply schemes were transferred from local authorities to NWSDB in \norder  to  improve  coverage  and service.  NWSDB,  provincial  councils,  urban  and  municipal \ncouncils, and pradeshiya sabhas have a mandate to provide water and sanitation services. The \nColombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC)  is  the  only  municipal  council  in  Sri  Lanka  to  provide \ncomprehensive sewerage and sanitation services within its jurisdiction. It is envisaged that \nKandy  Municipal  Council  will  offer  sewerage  services  in  the  near  future.  Private  sector \nparticipation in the water and sanitation sector is limited and is mostly in the form of (i) small-\n                                                 \n1  Department of National Planning. 2006.

", "Appendix 3  27 \nscale providers supplying drinking water to households, and (ii) civil work providers where \nselected functions have been outsourced.  \n \n4.  Policies. A draft Water Supply and Sanitation Policy was formulated in 2002 to provide \nguidance  to  NWSDB,  provincial  councils,  local  authorities,  lending  institutions,  community-\nbased organizations (CBOs), and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) involved in delivering \nwater supply and sanitation services. It included investment strategies to achieve coverage, \nservice quality and cost recovery objectives. A cabinet paper has been under revision since \nApril 2004, when NWSDB was asked to bring it into line with new Government investment \nstrategies. Separate water and sanitation policies have since been prepared. NWSBD\u2019s Board \nhas approved the draft sanitation policy, but approval by cabinet is still pending.  \n \n5.  Regulation.  Regulators  are  generally  responsible  for  monitoring  and  enforcing  \ndischarge licenses and fees and service quality and for setting affordable and efficient tariffs. In \nthe case of Sri Lanka, two main bodies have been given responsibilities. The Public Utilities \nCommission (PUC) was created by Parliament in late 2002 to regulate water, electricity, and \nports. Although commissioners were appointed soon after its establishment, it is not carrying out \nits functions fully, partly because of delays in the formulation and approval of the Water Industry \nAct. The Government is currently reviewing how NWSDB\u2019s operations can be brought into line \nwith the PUC Act to enable the PUC to undertake technical and economic regulation.5  \n \n6.  The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has powers to enact laws and regulations \nassociated  with  wastewater  pollution  control  and  discharge  standards.  For  all  Board  of \nInvestment  (BOI)  registered  industries,  the  CEA  has  delegated  its  powers  to  enforce  the \nregulations to the BOI. The pre-treatment standards currently applied to the industries within the \nBOI-owned processing zones are not national standards but BOI\u2019s own requirements. The \nimplementation of the CEA regulations for certain industrial sectors can be delegated to the \nlocal  authorities.  For  industries  such  as  hotels  and  restaurants  in  Colombo,  discharge \ncompliance monitoring and enforcement has been delegated to CMC and is linked to business \nlicense renewals. The Urban Development Authority (UDA) is responsible for regulation and  \nguidelines for on-site sanitation.   \n \nD.  Institutional Framework: On-Site Sanitation \n \n7.  Institutional  Arrangements.  In  general,  capital  investment  associated  with  on-site \nfacilities is borne by the developer or owner. There are several programs that provide financial \nhelp to the poor to provide their own facilities. Every facility has to be approved by local \nauthorities before construction.   \n \n8.  Key  Legal  and  Environmental  Requirements.  Legal provisions  relating  to on-site \nsanitation  facilities  are  comprehensive  and  are  contained  in  several  acts,  ordinances  and \nregulations.6 Under the current regulations, if on-site facilities are installed distant from other \nbuildings, formal approval is not necessary and construction can proceed. Under the new \nregulations, the proposed siting of all on-site facilities would require formal approval. \n \n                                                 \n5  With ADB technical assistance (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \nfor Strengthening the Regulatory Framework for Water Supply and Sanitation. Manila), the Government is also in \nthe process of developing (i) an adequate tariff-setting methodology, (ii) a customer code, and (iii) technical \nstandards for water and sewerage services.  \n6  They include Nuisance Ordinance, Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance, Town and Country Planning \nOrdinance, Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance, Local Authority Regulations, the UDA Act and the National \nEnvironment Act and Environmental Protection License Regulations. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n9.  Financial Requirements. Free septage removal7 is provided by municipalities. Local \nauthorities need to consider operation and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery through collection \nof a reasonable and affordable fee by a private company or the local authority. Both Colombo \nand Dehiwela/Mt. Lavinia municipalities include areas without sewerage services that rely on \nseptic tanks. \n \nE.  Areas of Greater Colombo Covered by the Sewerage System \n10.  The sewerage system in Greater Colombo comprises about 320 kilometers of sewers, \n18 pumping stations, and two sea outfalls. Although the initial sewerage schemes in Greater \nColombo were built between 1906 and 1920, they have been substantially rebuilt and extended \nunder the World Bank and Saudi Fund projects in the 1980s and 1990s. Significant parts of the \nexisting  systems,  including  the  ocean  outfalls,  are  less  than  30  years  old.  There  are  two \nindependent systems, each serving a catchment area, originally draining to a treatment plant. \nThese  treatment  plants  were  both  abandoned  in  1950s:  the  northern  plant  because  of \noperational problems and the southern plant because of residents\u2019 complaints over nuisance \nand odor. Both are beyond recovery. The northern system discharges through a sea outfall at \nMutwal (1,500 mm in diameter and 2,053 m long). The Kolonnawa sewerage system in the \nNWSDB service area is pumped into this northern system and is pumped onward, so it needs to \nbe operationally integrated. The southern system discharges into the outfall at Wellawatta \n(1,500 mm in diameter but 1,394 m long). The Dehiwala/Mt Lavinia (DMMC) systems are \npumped into the southern system but discharge into the Wellawatta junction box and are thus \nlargely independent of the upstream operation of the southern system.  \n \n11.  Service Provision. It is estimated that at present the system serves an area with about \n140,000 households.8 Within Greater Colombo, there are a number of areas with sewerage \nsystems, including: (i) systems operated by CMC, (ii) systems operated by NWSDB (Kolonnawa \nand DMMC), (iii) systems in industrial processing zones, (iv) housing scheme systems, and (v) \nindividual hospital self-contained systems. There is no formal agreement in place between the \ntwo organizations with regard to the cross-boundary flows, or between private owners and \nNWSDB and CMC. In addition, new industrial sewage treatment plants and associated local \nsewerage systems are currently being developed by NWSDB in Ja-Ela/Ekala and Ratmalana. \nWhile CMC and NWSDB own most of the 320 kilometers of sewers, several smaller schemes, \nwhich ultimately feed into the main system, are owned by government institutions (National \nHousing Development Authority, Urban Development Authority, Greater Colombo Economic \nDivision, Board of Investment) or private companies (e.g., Ceylinco, Finco, Apollo Hospital). \n \n12.  Asset Ownership. Despite earlier moves to transfer assets9 in Colombo municipality to \nNWSDB,10 the attorney general's legal opinion of 25 September 2007 established that in the \nabsence of Parliamentary approval, the assets remained under CMC's ownership. However, \n                                                 \n7 These services generally include septic tank emptying using vacuum tankers with discharge into the sewerage \nsystem (one of the pumping stations). \n8  While 64,000 households are currently registered in the CMC areas as connected, it is extremely common to find \ntwo or more households per connection. Out of these, 80% are domestic and 20% are non-domestic.  \n9  This refers to the compulsory transfer of the Colombo Municipal sewerage system by Order published in Gazette \nNo. 71/4 of 16 January 2006 and the voluntary transfer of the sewerage system by Order published on 9 May \n1996. \n10  At the time when the transfer agreement was reached, an understanding was also concluded whereby NWSDB \nwould pay SLRs20 million a year and CMC SLRs70 million a year for the O&M costs of the system. This \nunderstanding was recorded in NWSDB Paper No S/40/96-496. However, this agreement was never formalized \nwith an official document signed by both parties. In 2004, following a letter from the mayor of Colombo to the \nminister of housing and plantation infrastructure drawing his attention to the agreement on O&M costs, NWSDB \nwas instructed to reimburse CMC the annual amount of SLRs20 million unpaid over the years.  ", "Appendix 3  29 \nsewerage assets covering parts of Kolonnawa and DMMC11 are both owned and operated by \nNWSDB. New schemes being developed in Ja-Ela/Ekala and Ratmalana are also to be owned \nand operated by NWSDB upon completion of the works. \n \n13.  Cost Recovery. In the CMC area, sewerage and sanitation services are provided as \npart of municipal services for which a property tax is charged to the residents. Revenues for \nsewerage  consist  of  government  grants  and  reimbursements,12 registration  fees  paid  by \ncontractors and suppliers, administration charges and other miscellaneous income. CMC is on \nthe process of preparing cost recovery plan, including its time-bound action plan to increase the \nrevenue to recover the O&M cost and debt service by 2014.   \n \n14.  The  introduction  of  a  sewerage  charge  by  NWSDB  to  recover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs was approved by cabinet in 2002. Subsequently, NWSDB's Board and the \nMWSD minister approved a tariff policy and structure. The notification of the new sewerage tariff \nwas gazetted in October 2007 and billing started in March 2008 for properties connected to the \nsewerage network in DMMC and Kollonawa. The sewerage charge is part of the water bill.  \n \n15.  Planning  and  Asset  Management.  NWSDB  has  a  corporate  plan  for  2007\u20132011, \nalthough it does not have a business plan with supporting financial projections, targets or \nindicators that can be monitored. The annual budget is prepared over a period of 5 months \nusing  performance-based  budgeting  where  costs  and  inputs  are  designed  to  match \nperformance and outputs. System operation and maintenance consists of crisis management \nrather than strategic decisions based on risk analysis and the long-term sustainability of the \nnetwork, or a holistic approach that considers legal, technical, financial, regulatory, operational, \nand customer service aspects.13 NWSDB has acknowledged that revisions to its operational \napproach are needed and is currently reviewing decentralization of responsibilities to regional \noffices. It is anticipated that this will lead to more rapid and responsive decision making. CMC is \nyet to introduce asset management into its operations. \n \nF.  Financial and Operational Performance of Colombo Municipal Council \n \n16.  CMC's overall financial performance and that of its sewerage operations is described in \nTable A3.1. CMC's capital expenditure was in excess of capital receipts in 2004 and 2007. \nThese  deficits  were  adequately  covered  by  its  accumulated  surplus.  CMC's  property  rate \ncollection efficiency has ranged from 94.7% in 2003 to 84.1% in 2006. However, in terms of \nnumber of months for accounts receivables, CMC's performance was poor over the 2001\u20132008 \nperiod, but it is improving (from 17.2 months in 2001 to 14 months in 2008). With no incremental \nrevenue from the Project, CMC will have to finance debt service and increased O&M costs from \nits own revenue. It will have to increase its revenue by SLRs370 million in real term by 2014 to \nadequately finance O&M cost and debt service.14   \n \n                                                 \n11  NWSDB also owns and operates a small scheme in Kataragama and various housing schemes in Koggala.  \n12  For 2003\u20132007, government grants and reimbursements were the biggest source of revenue (about 81%). In 2007, \nCMC did not receive any grants for sewerage operations, resulting in a marginal revenue of SLRs8million. \n13  Asset management considers the process of establishing on operating regime under which the sustainability of \ncapital investment for assets is ensured through effective management of risk, performance, condition and cost. \n14 For example, by revising annual rental values (13% increase) and increasing the property tax rate (5 percentage \npoints increase for both residential and commercial areas). \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.1: Colombo Municipal Council Financial Performance, 2004\u20132007 (SLRs million) \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nCapital Receipt and Expenditure \nCapital Receipt  366  605       1,085  251 \nCapital Expenditure  431  535   448  496 \nSurplus (Deficit)    (65)    71   637  (245) \nRevenue and Recurrent Expenditure \nRevenue  2,554  2,984  3,365  3,701 \nRecurrent Expenditure  2,500  2,964  3,641  4,069 \nSurplus (Deficit)  54  20  (277)  (369) \nSewerage Operations \nRevenue    54    98    26      8 \nRecurrent Expenditure  183  242  282  303 \nSurplus (Deficit)  (129)  (144)  (256)  (295) \nSource: Colombo Municipal Council. \n \n17.  Historically, the incentives for improving services have been political, arising from the \ninvolvement of the elected council members, or have been instigated by the CMC officers \nthrough their desire to serve the public. With no effective customer service regulation there has \nbeen no corporate incentive for CMC to set objectives for improvements in the levels of service \nprovided. Such objectives need to be set and monitored and a timetable for targets and defining \nefficiency indicators needs to be established.   \n \nG.  Financial and Operational Performance of National Water Supply and Drainage \nBoard \n \n18.  The financial performance of NWSDB improved in 2006 compared with previous years \nbut it subsequently declined. Table A3.2 contains a summary of the income statement for 2005\u2013\n2008. Because of the recently approved water tariff increase, NWSDB has projected a profit for \n2009 of about $4 million. However, with no incremental revenue from the Project, NWSDB will \nneed to increase the service charges by not less than 3.5% per year in real terms to recover the \ncost of services. \n \nTable A3.2: National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n  Net Profit Summary, 2005\u20132008 (SLRs million) \n Item  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nWater Sales  5,446  5,869  6,482  6,743 \nOperating Profit on Sale of Water  1,842  1,789  1,579  654 \nProfit or (Loss) before Depreciation  1,480  1,525  806  266 \nNet Profit or (Loss) from Operating Activities  437  425  (575)  (1,664) \nProfit or (Loss) before Income Tax  (22)  20  (1,224)  (2,797) \nNet Profit or (Loss) for the Year  (92)  (44)  (1,278)  (2,863) \nSource: National Water Supply and Drainage Board.  \n \n19.  Although NWSDB conducted a benchmarking exercise for its operations in 2002 and its \ncorporate strategies15 have set targets for improved operational and financial performance, it is \nyet to set separate specific operational targets for its sewerage operations. \n \n                                                 \n15  National Water Supply and Drainage Board. 2002.

NWSDB  has  created  a  new  sewerage  division  responsible  for  the  planning  and \noperation of all sewerage schemes in Sri Lanka. While this is an appropriate interim measure, it \nmay need to be integrated into NWSDB's decentralization process once activities are expanded. \nAvailable preliminary annualized revenue and expenses data for sewerage activities16 show \noverall losses, with operating expenses exceeding income by about a third. Nonetheless, this \nrepresents a substantial improvement in performance from previous years when there was no \nsewerage tariff. NWSDB is preparing a revision of its sewerage tariff in 2010.  \n \n21.  Salary and personnel costs are 65% of all sewerage-related costs, while utility costs \n(essentially electricity costs) are 12%. Repairs and maintenance costs remained low (5% of the \ntotal) during 2008. Although some schemes (such as that in Hikaduwa) are relatively new, and \nno major repairs are expected, the maintenance allocation will need to increase progressively.  \n \nH.  Policy Gaps and Weaknesses  \n22.  Private sector participation in water and sanitation remains generally low, partly because \nof the inherent difficulty of delinking initiatives and reforms from the political process, which \nwould allow tariff setting to be regulated by a fully functional public utility commission entirely \nreflecting capital and operational costs, including an adequate return on invested capital, and \nthe  pending  status  of  the  water  and  sanitation  policies  to  clearly  outline  the  role  and \nresponsibilities of the private sector and other partners.  \n \n                                                 \n16  This corresponds to the 8-month period from January 2008 to August 2008.

The Colombo sewerage operation has long been neglected. This is partly due to the \nambiguous institutional arrangements for asset ownership, which has deterred an adequate \nlevel of budgeting and management of the system. Operational inefficiency has created an extra \nfinancial  burden  by  causing  emergency  repair  works  and  earlier  than  necessary  asset \nreplacement.  \n \n2.  In 2007, the attorney general issued a legal opinion that all wastewater assets within \nColombo municipality administrative area were owned by the Colombo municipality. Colombo \nMunicipal Council (CMC) is now a legal owner of the wastewater systems and at the same time \nis  responsible  for  their  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  CMC,  as  a  municipal  council \nconstituted and administered by the Municipal Council Ordinance,1 does not charge a separate \ntariff for municipal services but runs municipal services using the budget allocated from the pool \nof revenue collected from the property tax. However, this budget has been inadequate to enable \nit to carry out proper O&M. \n \n3.  Now  that  the  Project  provides  a  large  capital  investment  to  rehabilitate  the  critical \nelements of the sewerage system, it is essential to ensure the sustainability of this investment. \nIn  parallel  with  various  activities  to  support  institutional  and  operational  strengthening,  the \nProject proposes a consolidated contract combining design, construction, and O&M. Under this \ncontract, the budget for O&M is secured through the contract, and the staff of the municipal \nservice provider will receive on-the-job training throughout the contract period, in particular \nduring the commissioning period, before they take over the full responsibility for the O&M of the \nrehabilitated sewerage assets. \n \n4.  Under  this  contract,  CMC,  as  the  asset  owner,  retains  responsibilities  for  asset \nmanagement and capital investment works contemplated under the Project, through the project \nmanagement unit of the Project (PMU). The contractor will design, build and operate and \nmaintain the pumping stations at a pre-agreed cost. The key merits of this combined contract \nare (i) to incentivize the contractor to take an integrated approach to system design, considering \nO&M aspects; (ii) to indirectly enhance the quality of construction by extending the contractor's \nresponsibility beyond the commissioning and maintenance stage; (iii) to provide continuity of \nsystem operation while the construction is ongoing; (iv) to increase the predictability of the \nsystem  in  terms  of  technical  and  budgetary  requirements;  (v)  to  involve  CMC  staff  for  a \ntransition period before they take full responsibility; and (vi) to secure an adequate O&M budget \nbased on contractual requirements. The design\u2013build\u2013operate contract will clearly define the \nterms and conditions for each stage. \n \n5.  The term of the contract will be 6 years\u2014detailed design for 0.5 years, construction for \n2.5 years, and O&M for 3 years\u2014with a possible extension for another 3 years. \n \n6.  The scope of the O&M element of the contract is limited to responsibility for the O&M of \nthe  pumping  station  facilities  constructed  and  equipment  provided  by  the  contractor,  with \npossible expansion to the remaining three pumping stations that have not been included in the \nscope of the Project but were recently rehabilitated by other external development agencies' \nfinancial support.  \n                                                 \n1 Municipal Council Ordinance No. 17 of 1865, later amended and called the Colombo Municipal (Constitution) \nOrdinance No. 6 of 1935. \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \n \n7.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project will contribute to rehabilitating sewerage infrastructure in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area and \nsurrounding areas and will improve environmental and public health through improved urban services. This is line with the \nGovernment's Ten-Year Development Framework, 2006\u20132016, which includes increasing access to improved sanitation \nfacilities as part of its focus on urban development. The Project will have a positive impact on the poor. The public health \nimpact from reduced overflows and leakages will benefit the poor who often live near polluted inland water ways.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nA survey conducted during project preparation gathered baseline socio-economic information and willingness to pay data. The \nsurvey sample was drawn from 20 locations across the Project area and involved 1,000 household interviews, supplemented \nby 100 interviews with public and private sector organizations. The poverty analysis used primary data from the survey and \nprimary information gathered from case studies in three on-site areas, transect walks, and focus group discussions with \nvarious stakeholders. Secondary data from government agencies and international organizations were also used. \n \nThe survey recorded that 5% of respondents had household incomes below the poverty line, which is fairly consistent with \nofficial district data. The survey covered the Colombo Municipality, Thimbirigasyaya, Dehiwela/Mount Lavinia, and Kolonnawa \ndivisional secretariats. It identified that, for high-income households, 80% used the central sewerage system. By contrast, only \n58% of poor households were covered by the system. The poorest households not connected to the central sewerage system \nused latrines. The poverty analysis reflected that the undercapacity of the sewer mains did not allow users to connect to the \ncentral sewerage system. Leaks cause health risks and odor nuisance; and blockages caused by sedimentation due to poor \noperation and maintenance and the lack of rehabilitation undertaken over the past 20 years.   \n \nThe survey showed that for high-income households not covered by the central sewerage system, most have septic tanks and \nsoakaways. For the poorest households, none have septic tanks or soakaways, because they lack land and their habitations \nare close to each other. If low-income households own septic tanks, they are often poorly maintained, since the roads where \nthey live are too narrow for maintenance equipment. The problem is further compounded by high water tables which fill septic \ntanks almost immediately, and improper septic tank construction. About 66% of respondents dispose of grey-water in street \ndrains. Local government cites a lack of manpower, equipment (such as gully suckers), improper urban planning, and \ndilapidated systems as the main barriers to satisfactory sewerage and wastewater treatment. Poor sanitary conditions \ncontribute to diseases such as filariasis, skin diseases, diarrhea, dengue, and malaria. Respondents attribute increases in \nmosquito-borne diseases to maintenance holes that spill water most of the year\u2014requiring them to burn mosquito coils \nthroughout the day. Improvements to sanitation will reduce diseases and consequent morbidity and mortality. \n \nThe provision of high-quality and sustainable services to support economic development and poverty reduction will rely on the \nProject\u2019s support to build the capacity of CMC to plan and manage urban infrastructure more effectively. The Project will \nimprove CMC's capacity to plan, develop and operate pro-poor urban infrastructure and services, based on an improved \nunderstanding of poverty and on processes of participatory planning and development. Poverty and social analysis using a \ncombination of qualitative and quantitative techniques is required to gauge post-Project benefits in terms of improved access \nto basic services by the poor. The baseline survey, which will be carried out at the start of the Project, will serve as the \nbenchmark against which post-Project impacts on the poor may be measured. Benefits to poor households, benefits to \nwomen, increased participation and capacity building of poor including women are some of the issues that will be monitored \nduring and after implementation. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Project will include a component to institutionalize pro-poor and gender-inclusive practices at CMC, in line with the \ncommitments set out in its (draft) poverty reduction strategy. Overall, it is anticipated that the Project will reduce the burden of \ndiseases, treatment costs, and productivity losses. Women, especially poor women, will benefit from a reduction in the time \nand energy spent in disposing of sewage and the reduced work burden associated with cleaning and family health care. The \nspin-offs are expected to be economic growth and direct employment in unskilled/construction work under the Project. \n ", "46  Appendix 10   \n \nThe Project will include a pro-poor and gender subcomponent, under the institutional strengthening component of the loan, to \ninstitutionalize good practices in sanitation in underserved settlements in CMC, together with grant-financed pilot initiatives for \ncommunity-based and gender-responsive on-site sanitation facilities in selected underserved settlements in the CMC area.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nFindings of Social Analysis \n \nHuman development indicators show marked improvement in Sri Lanka\u2019s per capita income, life expectancy, adult literacy, \nand education in the last four decades. In 2003, life expectancy at birth was 74, the adult literacy rate was 90.3%, and the per \ncapita gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was $3,778 (UNDP, 2006, Human Development Report).  Based on \nthe 2002 census, poverty incidence was 23%. Poverty incidence among Sri Lanka\u2019s districts ranges from 6% to 34%. It is \nlowest in Colombo (6%) but over 143,000 people in Colombo have per capita incomes less than SLRs1,537. Population \ngrowth is faster in Colombo than the other districts (1.35% in comparison with the national average of 1.14%). Further, there \nis a high degree of variation in poverty incidence within Colombo\u2019s divisions. It ranges from 2.7% in Sri Jayewardenepura to \n14.2% in Hanwella. While only 6% had incomes below the poverty line in Colombo, 26% are in the next income group, so \nthere are many vulnerable people who are at risk of experiencing poverty. Poverty in urban Colombo is characterized by \nlimited access to basic services, including sanitation. \n \nIn general, data on access to basic services are improving. For example, UNDP records that the population with access to \nimproved sanitation increased from 68% in 1990 to 79% in 2002. However, sustaining these improvements will require proper \noperation and maintenance of existing systems. The Colombo sewerage system serves only 20% of population in Greater \nColombo. The system, built between 1906 and 1920, and substantially rebuilt and extended in the 1980s has sections which \nrequire urgent repair. For the remaining 80%, the majority (65%) are served by on-site facilities; the rest (15%) have no \naccess to any facilities. Most of the urban poor have no access to the sewage network or on-site facilities dispose of their \nwaste on the seashore, in canals and waterways, and in available open ground. With limited infrastructure and services, old \nand new urban centers risk not being capable of adequately supporting the increasing economic productivity of households. \n \nIn areas served by the sewerage system, the poor are often not connected. The system has not kept pace with population \ngrowth and has deteriorated in many instances. The increase in the number of poor households is making their access as a \ngroup worse off. Further, in areas served by a malfunctioning sewerage system, the poor who are not connected are \nsubjected to pollution caused by overflows and leaks from the system into waterways, which are already polluted by direct \ndischarge from households without access to the system. In areas with no services, the poor do not have household systems \nbecause they lack of funds for the capital investments required and do not have enough space for an individual septic tank. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nA diversity analysis has been undertaken before the stakeholder analysis covering physical, socioeconomic, and usage \ndiversity. Stakeholder mapping identified direct and indirect beneficiaries, pressure groups, and other interest groups at the \nnational, divisional, project, and community levels. The stakeholders were grouped into seven categories comprising: (i) users \nof the main sewerage system, (ii) users of septic tanks in areas not served by the sewerage system, (iii) managers of \nsewerage systems, (iv) other service providers, (v) regulators and administrators, (vi) policy makers, and (vii) other interest \ngroups. The expectations and likely benefits, and issues and concerns, of these stakeholders  were analyzed in the \nstakeholder analysis and considered in the project design, particularly in developing participation strategies. Information \ndissemination and consultations have been undertaken to ensure stakeholder participation in project design.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe Project will ensure participation during preplanning, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Pre-\nplanning focuses on building awareness of the Project, including disseminating information and awareness campaigns. A \nseparate framework for public awareness will be developed. The awareness campaigns will primarily ensure that the public in \nthe project area understands and appreciates (i) the link between good sanitation, hygiene, and health; (ii) the hidden costs of \nnot having good sanitation in terms of incurred medical costs, lost time, and burden on public medical services, and (iii) the \ntrue costs of the operation and maintenance of a wastewater collection, and disposal system and, therefore, the need for a \nrealistic  wastewater  service  charge.  During  planning,  participatory  activities  to  be  undertaken  by  the  project  include \ncommunity  and  resource  mapping,  identification  of  affected  people,  gathering  baseline  information,  consultations  and \ndiscussions. At the planning stage assistance and mitigation plans will be finalized through consultations and disclosed to \nstakeholders. During implementation, participation  will be ensured in carrying out implementation and monitoring and \n ", "  Appendix 10  47 \nevaluation. Women's representation and their effective involvement in all consultative and participatory processes supported \nunder the Project will be ensured. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nNational gender indicators show a balance between men and women in Sri Lanka. The 2001 census survey (covering limited \nareas in the north and east) indicated a sex ratio of 97.9 men to 100 women. Women had a higher life expectancy at birth and \nliteracy rates just 3% less than those of men. Despite women's higher levels of participation in education at secondary and \ntertiary levels, their political participation and representation is minimal. Life expectancy at 72 years for men and 77 years for \nwomen masks the high morbidity rate for women caused by illnesses such as diarrhea, dysentery and malaria. Safe drinking \nwater  was  available to 75.4% of the  overall  population and  satisfactory sanitation to 79% in  2002, but solid  waste \nmanagement in urban areas remains a critical issue. In terms of water and sanitation, the burden of improper design, \nconstruction, and operation of water and sanitation is borne largely by women. When piped water systems do not function, it \nis women who have to ensure its availability for use of other household members. If toilets are not useable, it is women who \nnegotiate with neighbors to share toilets. They are also responsible for disposing of wastewater from the kitchen and for \nensuring that potential problems with neighbors are minimized. Nonfunctioning public toilets are seen as a bigger issue for \nwomen than for men. Infants and children are particularly prone to waterborne diseases caused by insufficient sanitation, and \ncare of the sick is the responsibility of women. The Project will respond to these issues by ensuring women's representation \nand their participation in all consultation and participation processes and their equal access to employment opportunities \nprovided under the loan. More specifically, CMC's commitment to assess and institutionalize pro-poor and gender-inclusive \napproaches for on-site solid waste management (see below) may open up greater opportunities for beneficial impacts on \nwomen. \n \n2.

This will aim to take stock of lessons learnt from pilot projects within CMC \nfunded between 1998 and 2009 by development partners: Department for International Development of the United \nKingdom (DFID), UN-Habitat, German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the International Development Research \nCenter (IDRC), The pilot projects targeted the provision of basic services to underserved settlements (USS) in \nColombo. The stocktaking will identify pilot schemes carried out in underserved areas in partnership with CMC. It \nwill: (a) assess the design, implementation arrangements, consultative processes and socioeconomic and gender-\nrelated results; (b) document and draw lessons from the schemes; and (c) review the existing legal, regulatory and \nadministrative frameworks for the provision of urban basic services in the CMC area. \n(ii)  Reviewing promising practices in South and Southeast Asia. The findings and recommendations of the stocktaking \nexercise  will  presented,  discussed  and  further  assessed  at  an  international  workshop  n  Colombo.  This  will: \n(a) promote lateral learning between CMC and other selected municipal councils in South and Southeast Asia; \n(b) share information on socially-inclusive and gender-related policies, strategies, and operational approaches \n(including the effective use of pro-poor funding allocations) for greater outreach to the urban poor; and (c) inform the \ndevelopment of the Greater Colombo Wastewater Master Plan through the incorporation of pro-poor and gender-\ninclusive perspectives. \n(iii)  Identifying the way forward. This will include: (a) finalizing the CMC's poverty reduction strategy, drawing on \ndocumented lessons learnt; (b) assisting CMC to update policy guidelines to institutionalize good practices; (c) \nassessing future investment requirements in accordance with the Strategy; and (d) identifying technical requirements \nto continue recording the USS data into the current geographic information system (GIS) database. \n(iv)  Piloting alternative and unconventional on-site sanitation in underserved areas. These activities, financed by the \nPoverty and Environment Fund, will consist of carrying out one pilot intervention (18 months) in two selected USS \nwhich are not served by the existing public sewerage system. This will involve: (a) carrying out a participatory \nconsultative  process  with  the  beneficiaries  to  identify  the  most  appropriate  alternative  sanitation  technology;\n(b) identifying the potential for community participation in the implementation, operation and maintenance of the most \nappropriate alternative technique; and (c) assessing the possibility of extending the piloted approach to other \nmunicipal areas. \n \n \n \n ", "48  Appendix 10   \n \n \nIII.

The  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  upgrading  sewerage  infrastructure,  \n(ii)  strengthening  institutional  and  operational  capacity,  and  (iii)  project  management  and \nimplementation  support.  By  design,  the  Project  will  not  require  land  acquisition.  For \nrehabilitating  gravity  sewers,  sections  totaling  2.61  kilometers  (km)  will  use  trenchless \ntechnology and will have no resettlement impacts. The remaining sections (8.99 km) will use \neither trenchless technology or an open-cut approach. The choice of technology will depend on \na conditions survey that will be undertaken as part of the Project. Trenchless technology will not \nhave resettlement impacts, so, as a conservative approach, the short resettlement plan in \nSupplementary Appendix I assumes that the remaining sections will use an open-cut approach. \nOpen-cut rehabilitation will not require land acquisition. Where there is sufficient road width (i.e., \nfour or more lanes, estimated at 2.83 km), traffic can be managed to ensure that works will not \nresult in temporary access loss. For two-lane roads, there may be potential temporary impacts \nrelated to access disruptions. Transect walks were conducted on two road sections totaling 1.25 \nkm.1  \n \n2.  The potential temporary impacts of an open-cut approach would be access disruption \nfor: (i) residents, (ii) businesses and clients, (iii) vehicles, and (iv) institutions and patrons. This \ncan  be  mitigated  through  good  construction  practices,  which  will  be  the  responsibility  of \nconstruction contractors.2 Where access cannot be assured, businesses and their employees \nmay lose income. The transect walks were used as a basis to conservatively estimate possible \nincome losses.3 There will be no permanent or temporary land acquisition. Based on transect \nwalks and confirmation from the project preparation civil engineers, there will be no impacts on \npermanent structures or other assets. While it is estimated that there would be potential impacts \nfor an estimated 156 residential households in terms of access inconvenience, interviews show \nthat residents' livelihoods will not be affected except when their businesses or employment are \naffected by access. Five institutions were recorded in the transect walks, including cooperatives, \na post office, dispensary, and a temple. The transect walk shows that the institutions' operations \nneed not be affected, but additional mitigation measures such as not conducting work during \nspecial days for a temple should be undertaken during construction. Residents and business \nmay temporarily lose secure parking for their vehicles. Businesses and their employees may \nexperience partial income loss because of reduced client access. One pipe section is 20 m long, \nrequiring a trench 1.5 m wide. By opening the trench one section at a time, the disruption is \nestimated to be 5 days per 20 meter (m) section. There is great potential to minimize impacts, \nthrough proper planning and implementation of mitigation measures, to a level that will not affect \nincome. This will be undertaken during detailed design and project implementation. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  During  the  transect  walks,  interview  schedules  for  residents,  businesses,  employees,  and  institutions  were \nimplemented and this was supplemented with focus group discussions  to estimate potential temporary impacts. \n2  Measures are identified in the initial environmental examination (IEE) and include: (i) leaving spaces for access \nbetween mounds of soil, (ii) providing walkways and metal sheets to maintain access across trenches for people \nand  vehicles  where  required,  (iii)  increasing  the  workforce  in  front  of  critical  areas  such  as  institutions,  \n(iv) consulting business and institutions about operating hours and factoring this in work schedules, (v) providing \nadvance information on works to be undertaken, including appropriate signs, and (vi) coordination with the \nColombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC)  Traffic  and  Roads  Safety  Division  for  rerouting  of  traffic  and  traffic \nmanagement, and ensuring appropriate signs and policing of traffic. \n3  The assumptions are: (i) on two-lane sections, there would be a need for temporary road closure, and (ii) entire \nroads (as opposed to sections which are being worked on) will be closed. \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \n \nTable A11.1: Summary of Potential Resettlement Impacts \nCategories of Impacts  Temporary Impacts \n   \nLand Acquisition (permanent or temporary)  0 \nAffected Structures  0 \nParking Disruption (total number of residential vehicle owners)  515 \nParking Disruption (total number of commercial operators)   480 \nAffected Mobile Hawkers   65 \nAffected Immovable Businesses  428 \nAffected Employees of Businesses   1,340 \nAffected Institutions  22 \n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  During the transect walks surveys were undertaken, covering 61 residents, 15 hawkers, \n99 business owners or operators, 306 employees, 5 heads of institutions, 111 three-wheel \ndrivers, and 4 nightwatchers. These were supplemented by focus group discussions to provide \na comprehensive view of the socioeconomic characteristics of persons in the project area. \nApproximately 20% of households were headed by women. However, none of households \nheaded  by  women  had  incomes  below  the  poverty  line.  Average  per  capita  income  was \nSLRs20,400 per month for those surveyed in New Kettarama, and SLRs16,094 in Bodhiraja \nMawatha.  Of  those  who  will  have  potential  income  loss  during  project  construction, \nnightwatchers of parking lots were identified as vulnerable. The average incomes of this group \nwere only SLRs7,700 per month. To mitigate impacts on this vulnerable group, the Project will \nensure employment for these people. \n \nB.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n \n4.  The Land Acquisition Act, 1950 (LAA, amended from time to time) governs acquisition of \nland for public purposes in Sri Lanka. The act provides compensation for land, structures, and \ncrops. To address involuntary resettlement impacts due to development projects not covered by \nthe act, the Government adopted the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, 2001 (NIRP). \nThe NIRP identifies as one of its policy principles drafting amendments to the act to bring it into \nline with the NIRP for government approval and to prepare the necessary implementation \nguidelines. Nine core involuntary resettlement principles for the Project were taken directly from \nthe NIRP.4 An additional two principles from ADB\u2019s principles not clearly covered by NIRP were \nadded: (i) affected people are to be identified and recorded as soon as possible in order to \nestablish their eligibility through a population record or census that serves as an eligibility cutoff \ndate, preferably at the project identification stage, to prevent a subsequent influx of encroachers \nor others who wish to take advantage of such benefits; and (ii) the full resettlement costs are to \nbe included in the presentation of project costs and benefits. The entitlement matrix for the \n                                                 \n4  (i) Involuntary resettlement should be avoided or reduced as much as possible by reviewing alternatives to the \nproject as well as alternatives within the project; (ii) where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, affected people \nshould be assisted to re-establish themselves and improve their quality of life; (iii) compensation for loss of land, \nstructures, other assets and income should be based on full replacement cost and should be paid promptly (this  \nshould include transaction costs and replacement land should be an option for compensation in the case of loss of \nland\u2014in the absence of replacement land cash compensation should be an option for all affected people); (iv) \nresettlement should be planned as a development activity for the affected people; (v) affected people should be \nfully involved in the selection of relocation sites, livelihood compensation and development options at the earliest \nopportunity (resettlement should be planned and implemented with full participation of the provincial and local \nauthorities); (vi) common property resources and community and public services should be provided to affected \npeople (to assist those affected to be economically and socially integrated into the host communities, participatory \nmeasures should be designed and implemented); (vii) affected people who do not have documented title to land \nshould receive fair and just treatment; (viii) vulnerable groups should be identified and given appropriate assistance \nto substantially improve their living standards, gender equality and equity should be ensured and adhered to \nthroughout the policy; and (ix) project executing agencies should bear the full costs of compensation and \nresettlement. \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \nProject, based on the above principles and the potential impacts, is in Table A10.2.

Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n5.  The  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  stakeholders.  During \nconsultations, information was disseminated to affected people. Local language versions of the \nsummary resettlement plan have been made available in relevant government agencies and the \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  office.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite and the MLGPC website. Finalized resettlement plans will also be disclosed on the \nADB\u2019s  and  the  MLGPC  websites  and  posted  in  local  government  offices;  and  information \ndissemination and consultation will continue throughout project implementation.  \n \n6.  Grievances  of  affected  people  will  first  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  PMU \nresettlement specialist. Grievances not redressed by the specialist will be brought to the project \ndirector. Grievances not redressed will be brought to the safeguards committee in each district. \nThere is a long history of grievance redress for CMC services through the district engineer. This \npractice will be formalized for resettlement purposes through the safeguards committee. The \nsafeguards  committee  will  comprise  the  district  engineer  as  chair,  a  representative  from \nMLGPC, the PMU social safeguards officer, a female affected person or resident from the \ndistrict, and the PMU resettlement specialist who will observe and take minutes. The safeguards \ncommittee will meet when grievances are put forward by the project director to determine the \nmerit of each grievance, and to resolve grievances within a month of receiving the complaint. \nFurther grievances will be referred by affected people to the project steering committee. The \ngrievance redress mechanisms will continue to function throughout the project duration. \n \nD.  Compensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n \n7.  Based on the preliminary design there are no permanent impacts. Temporary impacts \nare restricted to impacts on access. Affected people will be provided with advance notice of  \nconstruction activities including duration and type of disruption. Construction contractors will \nensure  income  and  access  losses  are  avoided  through  actions  identified  in  the  initial \nenvironmental examination. The PMU will provide secure alternative parking locations, and \nassistance to mobile hawkers to move temporarily so they can continue their economic activity. \nShould construction activities result in unavoidable livelihood disruption, compensation for lost \nincome or a transitional allowance for the period of disruption will be provided. Any temporarily \naffected community infrastructure and property will be restored to pre-project conditions as part \nof the contractor\u2019s contract. The PMU will assess whether there are vulnerable affected people. \nVulnerable households will be provided information on all potential construction employment as \na  result  of  the  Project.  Transect  walks  identified  nightwatchers  as  vulnerable  persons. \nNightwatchers will be ensured temporary project employment in the Project's provision of secure \nparking spaces. All compensation and assistance to affected people will be completed prior to \naward of civil works contracts. \n \n8.  A detailed measurement survey will be undertaken to identify eligible affected people \nafter detailed design has been completed. At the time of the survey, individuals who are living \nor  working  in  areas  that  are  likely  to  be  affected  by  construction  or  operation  of  the \ninfrastructure works, regardless of whether they have legal title to the affected land or assets, \nwill be provided with cards to identify them as eligible for compensation and assistance.5  \n \n                                                 \n5  Eligible affected people will fall under the following general categories: (i) persons who lose income while \nconstruction is carried out in the vicinity of their business (owner/operators of businesses and their employees \nincluding nightwatchers in parking areas, and hawkers) (ii) persons whose normal activities are disturbed by the \npresence of trenches, excavated soil and machinery (residents and those under category i); (iii) affected people \nwho belong to socially and economically vulnerable groups. \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \n9.  The estimated budget required to implement the resettlement plan is SLRs26 million. \nThe resettlement budget will include a contingency amount of 10% to cover unanticipated \nresettlement impacts and additional amounts that may be needed to resolve disputes. A budget \nline will be allocated for the contingency, but funds will only be released on approval of the \nPMU project director accompanied by a proper justification for the additional expenditure. Any \nother departures from the budgets and allocations indicated in the resettlement plan will require \nthe same process of application and approval. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n10.  The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils will be the Project\u2019s executing \nagency.  CMC  will  be  the  implementing  agency  responsible  for  implementing  most  of  the \nactivities, except for the pumping station rehabilitation works within the NWSDB service area, \nfor which NWSDB will be the implementing agency. A project management unit (PMU) will be \nestablished within CMC directly under the municipal commissioner, led by a CMC officer at \nsenior management level for the duration of the Project. A small project implementation unit will \nbe established for implementing the works within NWSDB service area. A national project \nsteering committee will provide policy guidance to the Project.  \n \n11.  CMC resettlement planning and implementation capacity will be strengthened through \nprovision of expertise, and training and support for CMC staff, particularly at the district level. \nWithin  the  PMU,  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit  will  deal  with  safeguards  functions. \nResettlement  issues  across  the  Project  will  be  managed  and  coordinated  by  a  social \nsafeguards officer of the PMU. The social safeguards officer will be supported by a domestic \nresettlement  specialist  who  will  be  part  of  the  design,  construction  supervision,  and \nmanagement consultants.  \n \nF.  Resettlement Financing \n \n12.  Compensation  for  lost  income  and  PMU  costs  associated  with  resettlement  will  be \nfunded by the Government. Survey costs and other implementation costs not covered by the \nPMU  will  be  funded  by  the  Project.  Any  land  acquisition,  compensation,  relocation  and \nrehabilitation of income and livelihood will be considered as an integral component of Project \ncosts.  \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n13.  The PMU social safeguards officer will monitor whether resettlement is effective, make \nrecommendations for change where necessary, and report to the project director. The design, \nconstruction supervision, and management consultants -resettlement specialist will provide the \nPMU  with  training  in  resettlement  issues,  social  survey  methods  and  data  analysis  and \nrecording.  Monitoring  data  will  be  collected  from  PMU,  DSC,  contractors,  and  individual \naffected  people,  and  will  be  compared  with  entitlements  and  disbursement  schedules \nestablished  in  the  resettlement  plans.  The  PMU  will  also  engage  a  consultant  as  an \nindependent external monitor to conduct monitoring of the resettlement process. The consultant \nwill conduct compliance monitoring to check that entitlements have been provided as specified \nin the resettlement plan, and social impact evaluations to determine whether the compensation \nmeasures  have  mitigated  the  effects  of  the  project  and  delivered  the  intended  social \nimprovements.  The  external  monitor  will  report  to  MLGPC  and  ADB  throughout  project \nimplementation, and will produce annual reports that will identify any outstanding issues that \nneed to be addressed, and any departures from Government or ADB policy, together with \nrecommended remedial action. The reports will also identify any strategic lessons that need to \nbe  learned,  so  that  these  can  be  incorporated  into  future  resettlement  activities  of  the \nimplementing agencies, executing agency, the Government, or ADB.  \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION (SHORT) \n \n1.  The  Greater  Colombo  Wastewater  Management  Project  will  improve  the  urban \nenvironment by securing improved sanitation services for Colombo by upgrading sewerage \ninfrastructure, and strengthening the institutional, operational, and project management capacity \nof the wastewater service provider. The objectives of the Project are in line with those under the \nADB Country Partnership Strategy, 2009-2011 and the Government's Ten-Year Development \nPlan.1 \n \n2.  ADB classifies the Project as environmental assessment category B2 according to ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The Colombo \nMunicipal Council (CMC) will submit project information to the Central Environmental Authority \n(CEA) and the Coastal Conservation Department (CCD) to obtain necessary environmental \nclearances required by Government legislation. \n \nA.  Description of the Project \n \n3.  The Greater Colombo Sewerage System includes sewer infrastructure for the north \ncatchment area and the south catchment area. All the wastewater is discharged to the Indian \nOcean  through  two  long  sea  outfalls  at  Mutwal  (north  catchment)  and  Wellawatte  (south \ncatchment). Built between 1906 and 1920, and substantially rebuilt and extended in the 1980s, \nsome parts of Greater Colombo\u2019s sewerage system are in need of urgent repair. Due to its poor \ncondition and long neglected operation and maintenance (O&M), the system is not performing \nwell. \n \n4.  Table A12.1 lists the rehabilitation and upgrade of the sewage infrastructure considered \nfor implementation under the Project. \n \nTable A12.1: Details of Proposed Rehabilitation and Sewerage System Upgrade \n1. Rehabilitation of Main Sewerage System (Pumping Stations, Pumping Mains, Fine Screens) \n(i) Civil, mechanical and electrical works associated with installation or refurbishment of 17 pumping stations and four \nnew pumping mains; (ii) installation of coarse screens and grit removal equipment at 10 existing and one new \npumping stations; (iii) installation of fine screens, grit removal and washing equipment at headworks of the two \noutfalls; and (iv) supply of 10 standby generators including bundled fuel storage tanks and electrical control \nequipment \n2. Rehabilitation of Gravity Sewers \n(i) Replacement of 10 km critical sewers that are operating at below capacity, and (ii) refurbishment of existing gravity \nsewers by replacement of non-operational control (sluice) valves \n3. Rehabilitation of Sea Outfalls \n(i) Refurbishment of two sea outfalls in Mutwal and Wellawatte; (ii) installation of new diffuser at Mutwal outfall; (iii) \nunblocking of outlet points at Wellawatte outfall; and (iv) removal and safe disposal of grit deposits within the outfalls \nand improvement of means of access into outfalls \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment. \n \nB.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n5.  The significant positive environmental impacts are: (i) improvement in surface water and \ngroundwater quality due to reduction in overflows; (ii) elimination of future road collapses;  \n(iii)  reduction  in  local  flooding;  (iv)  elimination  of  cross-contamination  in  water  supply;3  \n                                                 \n1  The Mahinda Chintana (Vision for a New Sri Lanka: 2006-2016) is the Government\u2019s 10-Year Development \nFramework. \n2  This category includes projects judged likely to have some adverse environmental impacts, but of less significance \nthan Category A projects. \n3  There are many cross-connections installed to provide local relief in times of heavy rainfall or power cuts, to avoid \nsewage flooding to properties and highways. These cause overloading of the sewers during heavy rain, increased \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \n(v) reduction in health risks related to sanitation, contaminated water, and wastes; (vi) increase \nin effluent dispersion for the two outfalls; (vii) improvement in aesthetics, and (viii) protection of \nmarine ecology. The Project will be complemented by a comprehensive capacity development \nprogram ranging from strategic planning and management to technical and operational training \nby (i) preparing standard operational practices, health and safety manual, emergency plan and \npreventive maintenance plan; (ii) training operating staff on preventive maintenance practices; \n(iii)  supporting  CMC  in  building  a  mechanism  to  monitor  and  comply  with  environmental \nregulatory  standards;  and  (iv)  providing  equipment  for  cleaning  the  sewers,  removing \nblockages, and hygienically transporting collected wastes (grit and screening). \n \n6.  Most of the potential negative environmental impacts are during the construction phase, \nassociated  with  the  activities  of  the  construction  contractor(s).  By  including  environmental \nmanagement clauses in the individual contract documents, the potential for adverse impacts \ncan be significantly reduced. The Project is not expected to have major environmental impacts \nduring construction because (i) proposed works will be within flat, urban, and existing fenced \nland owned by CMC or National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), within the right-\nof-way of existing roads, and/or underground, (ii) inevitable disturbance to relatively sensitive \nreceptors such as schools, housing, or places of worship will be mitigated through controls on \nthe activities of the contractors;  (iii) use of generated spoils4 will be limited to predetermined \nand non-productive areas; (iv) existing sewers will be relined, or replaced using, wherever \npossible, trenchless technologies; (v)  other utilities (specifically water pipes above sewer lines) \nwill be predetermined to prevent interference; (vi) potential access disruption for residents, \nbusinesses and clients, and vehicles will be mitigated through consultation, and provision of \nadvanced information, walkways, and metal sheets; (vii)   assembly on land of inert materials for \nthe outfalls will not disturb the sea bed and the limited marine environment; and (viii) temporary \nrisks to workers, specifically in underwater work and confined spaces, will be mitigated by using \nthe services of experienced and certified marine contractors and specific contract provisions on \noccupational health and safety practices. \n \n7.  During operations, potential environmental impacts will be public health effects, aesthetic \neffects,5 and effects on the marine ecology due to outfall discharges. The two long outfalls were \ninitially designed with diffusers to achieve high levels of dilution and dispersion which will be \nachieved after rehabilitation. Modeling studies6 indicate good mixing, dispersion, and bacteria \ndie-off under most weather and tide conditions during operations of the rehabilitated outfalls. \nHowever, pollution sources not within the scope of the Project (Kelani River, existing harbor, \nBeira Lake, the canals, and industries, institutions, and establishments that produce low levels \nof pollution) will still deposit high-concentration loadings in the coastal environment. Regular \nmonitoring will be carried out on both outfalls, surface waters, and along coastlines. Repetitive \nmeasurements in the surface and vertical profile of sampling points situated in and around the \noutfall's end will be done for the correct evaluation of the discharge and for the evaluation of the \noutfall performance and effects. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \npumping costs, introduction of grit and other debris, and overflows. The Project will implement a program to identify \nand remove such cross-connections. \n4   Approximately 6,400 m3 of spoils will be generated from ground excavation. \n5  Aesthetic concerns relates to the possible presence of sewage-associated materials such as floatable solids, \ngrease, and oil which result in visual or olfactory pollution and to discoloration of the marine waters when dilution is \ninsufficient. \n6  Three studies have been carried out to investigate effluent plume dispersion from the sea outfalls, first under the \nGreater Colombo Sewerage Project in 2000, second under the Colombo Port Efficiency and Expansion Project in \n2003\u20132004, and the most recent by the Lanka Hydraulic Institute in 2009. \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \n \nC.     Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n \n8.  The Ministry of Local Government Provincial Councils (MLGPC) will be the executing \nagency.  A national-level project steering committee (PSC) will be established to oversee the \nProject and provide policy guidance and coordination among the government agencies involved \nin the administrative process of the Project. CMC will be the implementing agency responsible \nfor supervising infrastructure construction (except for pumping stations within the NWSDB area \nfor which NWSDB will be the implementing agency), conducting the noninfrastructure elements, \nand will establish a project management unit (PMU). The PMU will have a monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) unit and will be supported by design and management consultants, who will \ndesign the infrastructure, manage tendering of contractors, and supervise construction. Their \ncontract  will  require  the  consultants  to  include  mitigation  measures  in  designs  where \nappropriate, and to specify other measures in construction contracts. Environmental issues will \nbe coordinated by an environmental specialist within the M&E unit, who will ensure that the \nProject complies with environmental safeguards. \n \n9.  Table A12.2 lists the potential adverse impacts and mitigation measures proposed to \nreduce  these  impacts  to  acceptable  levels.  It  identifies  who  will  be  responsible  for  the \nmonitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The table shows that most mitigation activities are the \nresponsibility of the construction contractors (employed to build the infrastructure during the \nconstruction stage, or the O&M contractors employed to conduct maintenance or repair work \nwhen the system is operating. Responsibility for the relevant measures will be assigned to the \ncontractors via the contracts through which they are appointed so they will be legally required to \ntake the necessary action. \n \nTable A12.2: Summary of Impacts, Mitigation Measures, and Institutional Responsibilities \nPotential Adverse  Institutional \nEnvironmental Impacts  Proposed Mitigation Measures  Responsibilities  \nPre-Construction Stage (Location and Design)\nLand requirements  Consultation on detailed alignment of sewers prior to installation  PMU (M,R,E) \nInterference with existing utilities  Detailed consultation on existing utilities prior to installation  PMU (M,R,E) \nImpacts on heritage features  Consultation  on  cultural  heritage  features;  develop  protocol  in  PMU (M,R,E) \nconducting excavation work to ensure that any chance finds are \nrecognized \nNoncompliant discharges despite  CMC, CEA and CCD to liaise concerning practical aspects of  PMU-CMC \nrehabilitation   existing and proposed discharge standards to coastal waters  (M,R,E), CEA (E),  \nCCD (E) \nStrengthening institutional capacity and operational capacity of  PMU (M, R, E) \nCMC \nHigh energy demands  and poor  Continuous  discharge  of  effluent;  reduce  entry  of  materials;  PMU (M,R,E) \ndilution due to partial blockage,  increase  dilution  performance  during  low-flow  regimes,  and \nhigh  head  loss,  uneven  flow  reduced headloss at peak flow; develop outfall operations manual \ndistribution,    and  intrusion  of \nsaltwater and sediments (blocking \nof ports) \nDamage from ship anchors and  Mark outfall locations; in shallower areas, outfall pipelines must be  PMU (M, R, E) \nfishing vessels  buried; use of fail-safe joints and/or rubber risers \nUnacceptable  industrial  Establish institutional prerequisites for source control  PMU (M,R, E) \ndischarges to sewers  Enforcement of pre-treatment; legal arrangement for inter-agency  PMU (M, R, E) \nsewer discharge; procedures and program of identification and \ndealing with illegal connections \nCorrosion  from  salt  and  acid  Use corrosion-resistant materials  PMU (M,R,E) \nattack \nUse  of  substandard  materials  Ban use of asbestos and CFCs, and promote use of pumps from  PMU (M, R, E) \nand/or  materials  with  asbestos,  manufacturers with a accredited EMS or EMAS, or FSC certified \nCFC, etc  wood \nConstruction Stage \nDisturbance  to  residents  and  Limit  and  control  working  hours,  noise,  dust,  vibration,  PMU (E),  \n ", "  Appendix 12  57 \nPotential Adverse  Institutional \nEnvironmental Impacts  Proposed Mitigation Measures  Responsibilities  \npublic  due  to  noise,  dust,  construction traffic through contract provisions  contractor (M,R) \nvibration, construction traffic \nUse of unapproved materials, e.g.  Environmentally Responsible Procurement; Control of construction  PMU (E),  \nsand  mining  in  rivers,  materials and sources through contract provisions  contractor (M,R) \nunsustainable  timber,  CFC, \nasbestos \nImproper disposal of construction  Reuse or recycle wastes wherever possible; Coordinate with CMC  PMU (E),  \nwastes  for pre-determined areas for disposal of spoils.

Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n10.  Primary stakeholders (residents, shopkeepers, and business people who live and work \nnear the construction sites; NWSDB; and CMC) and secondary stakeholders (other relevant \ngovernment  institutions,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  community-based  organizations \nworking  in  the  affected  communities;  other  community  representatives)  were  consulted  in \ndeveloping the IEE through face-to-face discussions on-site and workshops in September 2007. \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \n \nViews and concerns were incorporated into the IEE, and the planning and development of the \nProject. \n \n11.  The environmental management plan (EMP) will be disclosed in Colombo as part of the \npublic consultation process to complete the Project\u2019s main IEE. Comments received will form an \ninput  to  EMP  finalization  following  Project  start-up.  Further  public  consultation  may  be \nundertaken if required by the CEA as part of its project approval conditions. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n12.  The screening process carried out in the IEE has not identified any significant negative \nenvironmental impacts likely to be caused by the Project. Potential negative impacts associated \nwith construction activities can be mitigated by the application of standard health, safety, and \nenvironmental  clauses  in  contract  documents,  close  supervision,  and  close  attention  to \ntransparency in tendering, and to quality control and supervision on site. Mitigation measures for \nother impacts are provided in detail in the IEE. Once the schemes are rehabilitated, it should \noperate without major environmental impacts, providing CMC and the contractors follow the \nO&M procedures prepared during the design stage. The Project will provide CMC and NWSDB \nwith training, and budgets to enable them to fulfill these responsibilities. \n \n13.  The Project is likely to have significant positive impacts on inland surface waters, public \nhealth,  and  institutional  development.  The  citizens  of  Greater  Colombo  will  be  the  major \nbeneficiaries of the rehabilitated sewerage system, as human waste from the areas served by \nthe network would be removed rapidly and disposed off in an acceptable manner. This should \nimprove the environment of these areas, and in conjunction with the development of other \ninfrastructure (in particular water supply), should deliver major improvements in individual and \ncommunity health and well-being. The project will improve CMC\u2019s environmental compliance by \nbuilding a mechanism to monitor and comply with environmental regulatory standards. The \nProject  will  improve  the  sanitation  service;  the  quality  of  life  should  therefore  improve \nsignificantly.  The  Project  will  conduct  a  program  to  raise  public  awareness  of  sanitation, \nhygiene, and solid wastes issues so the health of the community should also improve.  \n \nG.  Conclusions \n \n14.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  give  rise  to  any  significant  negative  environmental \nimpacts, and therefore does not require an ADB environmental impact assessment. The Project \nwill  significantly  improve  inland  surface  water  quality,  lower  risks  to  public  health  from \nwaterborne diseases, and restore sea outfalls functionality. Therefore it will have significant \npositive environmental impacts. \n \n15.  Mitigation of minor adverse impacts can be carried out as an integral part of the Project, \nduring  both  the  detailed  design  and  implementation  stages.  Appropriate  measures  will  be \nincluded in the tender documents for the civil works. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090907144044+08'00'", "Subject": "Report and Recommendation of the President  to the Board of Directors", "Author": "ga1", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "greater colombo wastewater management, sri lanka wastewater management, national water supply, environmental management plan, central environmental authority, adb project 36173", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090929105844+08'00'", "Title": "Greater Colombo Wastewater Management Project"}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Sri Lanka and its agencies ends on 31 \nDecember.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \nVice-President  X.
