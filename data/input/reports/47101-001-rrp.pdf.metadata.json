The \ninvestment components include the construction of two power generation projects with total new \ncapacity of 190 megawatts (MW), and installation of critical distribution assets in selected urban \nareas of Assam. The physical infrastructure development will be complemented with a capacity \ndevelopment component. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector  overview.  Assam\u2019s  power  sector  faces  serious  challenges:  about  37%  of \nhouseholds have access to electricity with about 5\u20136 hours of power cuts per day. In fiscal year \n(FY)  2012,  peak  demand  for  power  was  1,250  MW  against  available  supply  of  960  MW, \nindicating  a  shortfall  of  23%.  Only  about  30%  of  the  state\u2019s  700  tea  gardens\u2014one  of  the \nmainstays of the Assam economy\u2014are supplied with grid electricity. The remainder use natural \ngas  for  tea  manufacturing;  the  gas  supply  is  erratic.  On  the  supply  side,  Assam  is  heavily \ndependent on power imports from other states, with only about 25% of demand currently met by \nin-state generation.  During  peak  periods,  Assam  is forced  to purchase as  much  as  15%  of  its \npower  requirement  from  independent  power  producers  at  very  high  cost.  The  poor  financial \nperformance  of  the  state\u2019s  power  companies  imposes  a  burden  on  the  economy.  Demand for \npower is projected to increase to 2,200 MW by FY2020. Major investments in power generation \nare required to increase capacity and meet the growing demand.  \n \n4. \nThe  state\u2019s  power  distribution  company,  Assam  Power  Distribution  Company  (APDC), \nhas had some success in reducing losses: distribution losses decreased from 40% in FY2001 to \n24%  in  FY2012.  However,  loss  reduction  has  stagnated  due  to  the  provision  of  new  power \nconnections without system upgrades, inadequate investment, and poor management practices. \nAPDC\u2019s  inability  to  meet  the  loss  reduction  targets  approved  by  the  Assam  Electricity \nRegulatory  Commission (AERC)  has  resulted  in revenue  shortfalls.  APDC  has  petitioned for  a \ndistribution  loss  allowance  of  23%  for  FY2014  and  22%  for  FY2016.  Achieving  these  targets \nrequires capital investment and improvements in distribution system management. \n  \nThe state\u2019s power companies, Assam Power Generation Corporation (APGC) and APDC, \n5. \ndo not have sufficient cash flow to meet debt service obligations, invest in their capital assets, \nand  build  staff  capacity.  The  broader  economic  implications  of  the  poorly  performing  power \nsector  include  curtailed  competitiveness  and  productivity,  fewer  job  opportunities,  reduced \nprivate  sector  investment,  and  inefficient  use  of  resources.  Supply  deficits  force  consumers  to \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  investment  program  was  prepared  under  Asian  Development  Bank.  2009.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fuse  more expensive,  less-efficient,  and more  polluting  energy  sources, such  as  smaller  diesel \ngenerators.  \n \n6. \nPolicy  framework.  The  Electricity  Act  of  India  (2003)  enabled  unbundling  of  the  state \npower utilities, separating generation, transmission, and distribution functions. The act enabled \nthe  establishment  of  state  and  national  regulatory  agencies,  opened  access  to  transmission \nnetworks,  and  promoted  competition  in  the  electricity  industry.  The  National  Electricity  Policy \n(2005)  enabled  setting  targets  to  increase  availability,  eliminate  power  shortages,  and  define \nlifeline  consumption  to  ensure  profitability  of  power  entities.  The  Rural  Electrification  Policy \n(2006)  includes  provisions for  accelerated  rural electrification in  India through grid and  off-grid \nelectrification  and  innovative  financing  and  operating  mechanisms.  The  12th  Five  Year  Plan, \n(FY2012\u2013FY2017)  stresses the need to invest in renewable energy and frontier technologies.3 \n\n \n7. \nIn  2003,  GOA  introduced  a  power  policy  statement,  highlighting  the  need  to  (i)  ensure \ncommercial  orientation,  efficiency,  and  financial  viability  of  the  power  sector;  (ii)  carry  out \ntechnical,  managerial,  and  administrative  restructuring  of  power  utilities;  (iii)  increase  the \nnumber of power utilities in the state; and (iv) promote private sector participation in the power \nsector.  In  implementing  this  policy  framework,  GOA  unbundled  the  Assam  State  Electricity \nBoard  (ASEB)  into  three  companies:  APGC,  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation  (AEGC),  and \nAPDC. 4 AERC oversees the regulatory aspects of the sector.  \n \n8. \nSector  road map. GOA  prepared a  power sector master plan with Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  assistance5 for  the  12th  (FY2012\u2013FY2017)  and  13th  (FY2017\u2013FY2022)  planning \nperiods. Objectives are to (i) achieve universal access to electricity by 2022, (ii) improve quality \nand reliability of power supply, and (iii) remove power sector constraints to improve the state\u2019s \neconomy.  The  master  plan  includes  a  sector  road  map,  including  a  generation  plan,  a \ntransmission plan, and a distribution plan, with a total cost of about $3.5 billion. According to the \nplan,  the  state\u2019s  generation  capacity  will  be  increased  from  365  MW  (as  of  May  2013)  to  \n1,410 MW by March 2022. The total cost of this capacity addition is estimated to be $1.2 billion. \nIn addition, the northeast region of India is to increase generation capacity by 3,636 MW during \nthe 12th Five Year Plan period. Assam expects to access its share of about 990 MW from the \ncentral generating stations to help meet the state\u2019s growing demand. \n \n9. \nThe  transmission  plan  of  the  road  map  envisages  constructing  88  transmission \nsubstations, and about 4,800 circuit-kilometers (km) of transmission lines. The estimated cost of \nthe \nis  about  $1.1  billion.  The  distribution  plan  envisages  building  \n265  distribution  substations  and  63,500  circuit-km  of  distribution  lines  to  provide  about  \n7.1 million new power connections at a cost of about $1.1 billion. Loss reduction remains a key \nfocus  of  GOA\u2019s  sector  road  map:  it  aims  to  reduce  total  losses  to  19%  (comprising  15% \ndistribution  loss  and  4%  transmission  loss)6 by  FY2017.  The  road  map  includes  institutional \nstrengthening initiatives for improved construction supervision capacity, enhanced management \nof  ongoing  projects,  improved  financial  management  systems,  and  a  fully  computerized \nmanagement system.  \n\ntransmission  plan \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n3   Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

Since  2003,  ADB  has  supported  the  Assam  power  sector  with  five \nloans totaling $450 million for sector reforms, and transmission and distribution improvements.7 \nThe  power  sector  master  plan  and  associated  sector  road  map  are  consistent  with  the \ndevelopment goals and strategies of the central government and ADB. The government\u2019s 12th \nFive  Year  Plan  continues  its  11th  Five  Year  Plan\u2019s  infrastructure  investment  imperative,  and \nincludes  expanded  use  of  renewable  energy  resources  to  increase  energy  availability  in  the \ncountry. The investment program is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013\n2017  for  India,  which  envisages  expansion,  improvement,  and  better  management  of  energy \nsystems  through  renewable  energy  development,  transmission  and  distribution  system \nimprovement, and institutional strengthening.8 The investment program contributes to achieving \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy objectives of promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy, access to \nenergy for all, and capacity building and governance.9 \n \nInvestment  program.  The  total  investment  requirement  for  Assam\u2019s  power  sector  for \n11. \nFY2012\u2013FY2022  is  about  $3.5  billion.  The  investment  program  selected  a  portion  of  the  total \nrequirement, considering the priority needs. At $430 million, the investment program represents \napproximately  12%  of  the  overall  investment  requirement  of  the  Assam  power  sector.  It  will \nfinance  investments  for  physical  infrastructure  development  to  (i)  augment  in-state  generation \ncapacity  through  the  replacement  of  a  less-efficient  gas-fired  generating  plant  at  Lakwa  and \nconstruction of a new hydropower plant at Lower Kopili; and (ii) continue to address distribution \nloss  reduction  and  efficiency  improvement  through  renovation  and  modernization  of  the \ndistribution system. The program will also finance nonphysical components to achieve long-term \ninstitutional and financial sustainability of the power utilities.  \n\n \n\n12.  Major  lessons  from  previous  ADB  interventions  in  Assam  are  incorporated  in  the \nprogram  design  and  include  the  need  for  (i)  connectivity  of  the  Assam  grid  to  the  northeast \nregion,  (ii)  capacity  building  for  power  companies,  (iii)  continuous  efforts  to  reduce  losses,  \n(iv) increased in-state power generation capacity, and (v) strengthening of the Assam regulatory \nagency. ADB\u2019s ongoing investment program in Assam invests mainly in improving connectivity \n                                                \n7   ADB.  2003.

The  weak  capacity  of  power  institutions  in  Assam \nrequires  long-term  engagement  in the  sector  to help  achieve  its  long-term  objective:  universal \naccess  to  power.  The  MFF  is  the  most  suitable  funding  modality  to  support  the  investment \nprogram. First, it frontloads a major share of the analytical work, and then blends physical with \nnonphysical  investments  for  better  development  impacts  than  any  other  available  modality. \nSecond, the MFF modality provides up-front support for GOA\u2019s substantial investment plan with \nfinancial commitments sequenced to match project readiness, allowing the executing agencies \nand  ADB  to  dedicate  more  resources  to  project  implementation.  Third,  the  MFF  modality \nsupports high project readiness (such as design work and safeguard plans being executed up \nfront) and offers critical mass, continuity, and predictability in relation to funding. Finally, all the \nbasic preconditions for the use of an MFF are in place, including a sound policy framework and \nroad  map,  well-designed  investment  and  financing  plans,  an  agreement  on  the  treatment  of \nsafeguard policies and procedures, and a financial management and governance framework. \n \nB. \n \nThe  investment  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  increased  availability  of  electricity  in  Assam. \n14. \nThe  outcome  will  be  increased  capacity  and  efficiency  of  energy  generation  and  distribution \nsystems in Assam. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThe investment program will have three outputs: (i) upgraded and expanded generation \nsystem,  (ii)  upgraded  and  expanded  distribution  system,  and  (iii)  strengthened  institutional \ncapacity of APGC and APDC. Output 1 includes (i) replacement of less-efficient and old open-\ngas-cycle turbines with more efficient reciprocating internal combustion gas engines with 70 MW \ncapacity;  and  (ii) construction  of  a  hydropower  plant  with 120 MW capacity. Output  2  includes \nconstruction  or  upgrading  of  30  33/11  kilovolt  (kV)  substations  and  about  100  km  of  11  kV \ndistribution  lines.  Output  3  has  three  major  subcomponents:  (i)  project  preparation  and \nimplementation  support,  (ii)  enterprise  resource  planning  (ERP)  support,  and  (iii)  capacity \nbuilding  and  training.  Project  preparatory  support  will  be  provided  for  the  Lower  Kopili \nhydropower plant under tranche 3 of the MFF, and implementation support will be provided for \nthe  Lakwa  Gas  Power  Plant  Project  under  tranche  1.  ERP  support  includes  hardware  and \nsoftware  components  to  introduce  a  computerized  management  system  for  APGC  under \ntranche 1. Capacity building and training will be provided for financial management, accounting \nand  auditing,  project  management,  procurement,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  human  resource \nmanagement,  demand-side  management,  and  social  and  environment  safeguards.

APGC  will  be  the  executing  agency  for \ngeneration projects under tranches 1 and 3, and APDC will be the executing agency for tranche \n2.  The  APDC  and  APGC  chairpersons,  along  with  the  secretary  of  the  Department  of  Power, \nGOA,  will  co-chair  the  steering  committee\u2014the  oversight  body  of  the  investment  program.  A \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  under  the  APGC,  APDC,  and  AEGC  chairs,  headed  by  a \nproject  director,  is  already  functioning.  APGC  has  established  a  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU)  for  the  generation  projects  under  the  MFF,  and  APDC  has  an  established  PIU  for  the \ndistribution  component.

International  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  civil  works  and  turnkey  contracts,  with \nnational competitive bidding used for contracts for goods and equipment estimated to cost less \nthan  $1.0  million.  Advanced  contracting  and/or  retroactive  financing  are  envisaged.  The \nconsultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                \n12  Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n20. \nAPGC,  APDC,  AERC,  and  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  examined  potential  projects \nunder the investment program. These assessments covered technical, economic, financial, and \nsafeguard matters. ADB conducted its own independent due diligence on the potential projects, \nincluding climate risk assessments.13 \n \nA. \n \n21. \nAPGC and ADB conducted detailed studies to identify the best technology for a gas-fired \npower  plant  in  the  tranche  1  project.  These  studies  recommend  an  internal  combustion  gas \nengine plant. The gas supply to Lakwa is erratic because the gas supplied is associate gas from \noil  production.  The  internal  combustion  engine  can  maintain  high  plant  efficiency  and  better \nplant  gross  heat  rate  with  erratic  gas  supplies.  Similar  analyses  of  projects  proposed  under \ntranches  2  and  3  will  be  undertaken.  Preliminary  assessment  of  climate  change  risks  of  the \nhydropower subproject in tranche 3 shows that such risks would be minimal, as climate change \nmay not significantly impact the overall monsoon potential.  \n \nB. \n \nThe investment program will benefit about 2.76 million electricity consumers by reducing \n22. \nload  shedding.  It  will  enable  many  households  and  business  establishments  to  improve  their \neconomic,  commercial,  educational,  and  entertainment  opportunities.  The  generation  projects \nwill  strengthen  APDC\u2019s  financial  position  by  avoiding  the  purchase  of  expensive  power  from \nindependent power producers. The economic viability of the tranche 1 investment is confirmed \nthrough  a  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  conducted  using  ADB  guidelines  for  economic  analysis.  The \ntranche  1  project  replaces  gas  turbines  that  are  at  the  end  of  their  economic  lifespan  and \nexpensive  to  operate.  The  economic  benefits  of  this  replacement  will  accrue  primarily  as  a \nconsequence  of  reduced  gas  consumption  at  the  generating  plant  from  improved  technical \nefficiency.  In  addition,  incremental  power  generation  will  result  from  the  additional  10  MW \ncapacity.  The  run-of-the-river  type  hydropower  plant  under  tranche  3  provides  additional \nbenefits of avoided carbon dioxide emissions (534,000 tons per annum)14 and avoided local air \npollution.  Economic analysis  uses  only  the  benefits  of gas  savings from  the  tranche  1  project. \nWith this conservative assumption, the economic internal rate of return of the gas power plant \nreplacement is estimated to be  17.3%. Sensitivity analysis and switching values show that the \ntranche 1 project\u2019s economic benefits are stable against the major risk factors. \n \n23. \nAssessment  of  the  financial  viability  of  the  tranche  1  project  used  ADB  guidelines. \nIncremental  cash  flow  accruing  to  APGC  from  the  tranche  1  investment  is  considered  as  the \nfinancial  benefit  of  the  project. The  project  has  an  estimated financial  internal  rate of return  of \n5.5%  (post-tax  real)  against  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.7%.15 Sensitivity  analysis \nshows  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  robust  against  cost  increases  and  project \nimplementation  delays.  However,  it  is  sensitive  to  power  output  decrease.  Gas  supply,  one of \nthe main determinants of tranche 1 outputs, should be assured to reduce the risk of decreased \noutput. \n \n\n                                                \n13  Climate Change: Project Adaptation Action Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB estimated the carbon emission reduction. \n15  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n24. \nThe  governance  risks  for  APGC  and  APDC,  including  their  financial  management  and \nprocurement  capacities,  were  assessed.  The  accounting,  financial  management,  and  internal \naudit  functions  in  both  entities,  especially  APGC,  are  noted  to  be  weak.  Overall,  financial \nmanagement risk is assessed as high. The financial management risk mitigation includes (i) the \ncapacity  building  component  of  the  investment  program,  which  specifically  targets  the \nweaknesses  of  the  utilities\u2019  financial  management;  (ii)  implementation  of  time-bound  action \nplans  provided  by  APGC  and  APDC  to  address  major  financial  management  shortcomings \nhighlighted by the statutory auditors; (iii) specific covenants on financial management aspects in \nthe loan agreements; and (iv) use of the direct payment method to expedite disbursement and \nease  the  administrative  burden  imposed  on  APDC  and  APGC.  APGC  has  a  contract  and \nawards  department.  Currently,  the  PMU  handles  procurement;  it  has  four  qualified  staff  who \nhave received procurement capacity training from ADB.  \n \n25. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB reserves the right to examine and review directly any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, \nor  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  MFF  and  the  projects.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  were  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  GOA,  APGC,  and  APDC.  Specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual (footnote 12).  \n \nD. \n \nThe social assessment notes that the power sector has significant potential to contribute \n26. \nto  economic  development  and  social  well-being,  and  is  both  directly  and  indirectly  linked  to \npoverty  reduction.  A  reliable  and  adequate  electricity  supply  improves  living  conditions, \npromotes  business  expansion,  and  increases  employment  opportunities,  which  will  have  a \npositive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  A  good  quality,  reliable  electricity  supply  is  important  in \nmeeting  the  basic  human  needs  of  health  and  education.  Poor  and  vulnerable  consumers,  as \nwell  as  public  institutions  such  as  public  hospitals  and  schools,  are  often  particularly \ndisadvantaged by an inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. They will \ntherefore  benefit  directly  from  projects  under  the  MFF.  Tranche  1  is  classified  as  having  no \ngender  elements;  tranche  2  may  have  opportunities  for  gender  mainstreaming.  The  loan \nagreement  includes  a  standard  assurance  related  to  core  labor  standards  for  contractors \n(including  equal  pay  for  equal  types  of  work),  and  an  awareness  program  on  HIV/AIDS  and \nsexually transmitted diseases.  \n \nE. \n \nAn  environment  assessment  and  review  framework,  a  resettlement  framework,  and  an \n27. \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  (IPPF)  were  prepared,  outlining  the  environment  and \nsocial safeguard principles and requirements.16 APGC and APDC will undertake environmental \nand  social  safeguard  due  diligence  on  individual  projects  under  the  MFF,  and  submit \nsemiannual  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs) \nand, if required, the resettlement plans and indigenous peoples plans (IPPs).  \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n16  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fEnvironment (category B). The tranche 1 project is categorized B for environment. The \n28. \nADB  project  preparatory  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report, \nincorporating procedures for disposal of the obsolete plant, an EMP for disposal, cost estimates \nfor the EMP, and a grievance redress mechanism. APGC and the ADB project preparatory team \nundertook  public  consultations  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009).17 The \ngas  power  plant  replacement  project  is  not  located  in  the  vicinity  of  any  environmentally \nsensitive areas. No significant air, water, noise, or soil pollution will result from replacement of \nthe old plant. The potential adverse environmental impacts due to the project are envisaged to \nbe  minimal.  Any  adverse  impacts  can  be  readily  mitigated  using  standard  engineering  and \nenvironmental  practices  incorporated  in  the  EMP.  The  IEE  for  the  tranche  1  project  was \ndisclosed on the ADB and APGC websites. Tranche 2 (upgrading of power distribution system) \nis likely to be environment category B and tranche 3 (hydropower plant) is likely to be category \nA.  \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  tranche  1  project  is  categorized  C  for \nresettlement  impacts  in  accordance  with  the  SPS.  The  proposed  replacement  of  the  existing  \n60 MW plant will be undertaken within the existing premises of the Lakwa thermal power station \ncomplex,  utilizing  the  vacant  2.9  hectares  available  within  the  complex.  No  additional  land  is \nrequired,  and  hence,  no  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  envisioned.  Therefore,  no \nresettlement  plan  is  required  for  tranche  1;  a  social  due  diligence  report  was  prepared.  \nTranche 2 is likely to be category B for involuntary resettlement and tranche 3 likely category A \ndue  to  the  hydropower  plant  with  an  estimated  26  families  to  be  physically  displaced.  A \nresettlement framework was prepared in accordance with national  and state  laws  and policies \nand the SPS, and disclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The impacts of the tranche 1 project on indigenous \npeoples  are  classified  as  category  C.  An  IPPF  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  national  and \nstate  laws  and  policies  and  the  SPS,  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  Social  assessments \nconducted  during  project  preparation  did  not  find  any  indigenous  peoples  who  would  be \nimpacted  by  tranche  1  project  activities.  If  any  project  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  is  found \nduring  project  implementation,  project  authorities  will  formulate  an  IPP  in  accordance  with  the \nIPPF.  The  project  authorities  will  submit  the  IPP  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  If  future \ntranche  for  hydropower  impact  indigenous  peoples  or  tribes,  a  standalone  IPP  or  a  combined \nresettlement plan and IPP will be prepared in accordance with the IPPF.  \n \nF. \n \n31.
