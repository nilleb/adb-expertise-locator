I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Development \nProject in Northern Mountain Provinces.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  deteriorated  but  critical  rural \ninfrastructure in 15 mountainous provinces of northern Viet Nam.2 These provinces have a \ncombined population of 12.2 million people and are among the poorest in the country. Overall \npoverty rates average about 27%, but are considerably higher in more isolated areas, where \npoverty levels may be 50%\u201360%. One of the main reasons for these high levels of poverty is \nlimited access to productive assets and infrastructure (such as irrigation water systems), and \nphysical isolation. The project will focus on improving small- to medium-scale irrigation and/or \ndrainage systems, rural roads, and district and commune markets. The project will include 40\u2013\n45  subprojects.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  rural  infrastructure  is  expected  to  have  a \npositive impact on the lives and livelihoods of the population in the project area, providing easier \naccess to inputs (including irrigation water), markets, health services, higher levels of education, \nand employment opportunities, while reducing production and marketing costs.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The majority (84%) of the population of the northern mountain provinces live in sparsely \npopulated villages, dispersed where land is suitable for agriculture. The incidence of poverty \nremains consistently higher than in other parts of Viet Nam. While poverty has been reduced \nnationwide, from 28.9% in 2002 to 16.0% in 2006, and 11.0% in 2008, equivalent figures in the \nnorthern mountain provinces were 47.9% in 2002, 32.3% in 2006, and 27.0% in 2008. These \nfigures  reflect  the  more  difficult  environment  and  terrain,  and  the  lack  of  commercial \nopportunities, arable land, and water resources. Poverty rates among some ethnic minorities in \nthe project area are 70%\u201380% due to lower levels of access to rural infrastructure, limited \nopportunities  for  commercial  activity,  relatively  lower  education  and  skill  levels,  and  low \npopulation densities. \n \n4.  The 15 northern provinces are comparatively underdeveloped in national terms; this is \nreflected in the physical infrastructure. While the government and international development \npartners  have  invested  in  rural  infrastructure  since  1995,  a  huge  backlog  of  unimproved \ninfrastructure remains. Much of the existing infrastructure is in poor condition due to age, \ninadequate design and construction, and insufficient maintenance. Nationwide, only two- thirds \nof the 3 million ha provided with irrigation facilities is currently being irrigated.  In the project \narea, irrigation schemes supporting over 200,000 ha are in need of rehabilitation. Within these \nschemes, of the 50,000 kilometers (km) of primary and secondary irrigation canals, only 16,270 \nkm or 32% are lined, leaving the majority in need of lining to reduce water loss. Improving \nirrigation water management is critical to food security in the face of increased food demands \nand the effects of climate change. \n \n5.  In the case of rural roads, only 11.0% in the Northeast and 6.6% in the Northwest are \neither concrete-surfaced or sealed. This compares with 44.5% in the more developed region of \nthe  Red  River  Delta  and  28.0%  in  the  South  Central  Coastal  region.  The  north  has \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The provinces are: Bac Giang, Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Dien Bien, Ha Giang, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Lang Son, Lao Cai, \nPhu Tho, Son La, Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang, Vinh Phuc, and Yen Bai. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2008. Technical \nAssistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Development \nProject in the Northern Mountain Provinces. Manila. ", "2 \npredominantly  earth  and  gravel  roads,  which  are  particularly  unsustainable  in  hilly  and \nmountainous  terrains,  where  intense  rainfall  accelerates  their  deterioration  leading  to \nunaffordably high maintenance and repair costs. Furthermore, the distances faced by northern \ncommunities to the nearest all-weather road are much higher than elsewhere, averaging 4.4 km \nin comparison to 1.7 km in the Red River Delta. Distances are a key obstacle to accessing a \nrange of services, including health services. For example only 23% of communities in the \nNorthwest have access to a doctor compared with a national average of 60%. The quality of \ntransport  infrastructure  is  crucial  to  reaching  medical  attention,  an  especially  important \nconsideration for the welfare of women and children. \n \n6.  In this environment, rural infrastructure is not only a necessary prerequisite to stimulate \nprivate investment but it provides a foundation for rural development. Irrigation development \nenhances agricultural productivity and provides options for farmers to diversify production into \nhigher-value  goods,  thereby  enhancing  household  incomes.  However,  investments  in \nagriculture leading to surpluses will not be made if the produce cannot be cost-effectively \nmoved. Rural roads enhance access to markets, commercial opportunities, and input supplies \nfor  agricultural  production,  while  also  providing  access  to  education  and  health  services. \nFurthermore, many members of northern farming households are seeking off-farm employment \nto offset the cyclical costs and unpredictable returns of farming. Access to off-farm employment \nopportunities also requires good transport facilities.  \n \n7.  The government\u2019s draft socioeconomic development plan 2011\u20132016 indicates the intent \nto prioritize upgrading rural infrastructure to serve the dual objective of social and economic \ndevelopment. This includes upgrading irrigation for water supplies, aquaculture, double cropping \nin paddy areas, and the expansion of irrigated areas for cash crops. It also includes developing \nrural transport to move agricultural surpluses and improve social conditions. The project design \nis  therefore  based  on  (i)  an  identified  demand  to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  priority  rural \ninfrastructure  to  reduce  the  high  and  persistent  poverty  levels  in  the  northern  mountain \nprovinces,  thereby  improving  access  to  productive  resources,  services  and  socioeconomic \nopportunities, (ii) the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategies of providing \nrural infrastructure as a means to achieve poverty reduction as described in the government\u2019s \nnational socioeconomic development plan and other related documents, as well as ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program,4 and (iii) the successful design, implementation experience, and \nrelevant  lessons  from  earlier  ADB-funded  rural  infrastructure  projects.  Lessons  were \nincorporated from six successfully completed ADB projects implemented by the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD), particularly the Rural Infrastructure Sector Project,5 \nwhich had similar objectives and outputs to the proposed project.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  intended  impact  of  the  project  is  to  bring  about  sustained  socioeconomic \ndevelopment in the 15 northern mountain provinces of Viet Nam, while the intended outcome is \nto increase access to, and use of priority rural infrastructure by the poor and ethnic minorities in \nthe project area.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  priority  rural  infrastructure  in  all \n15 participating  provinces,  and  (ii)  improved  institutional  and  local  capacities  for  project \nmanagement and for rural infrastructure use and sustainability.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2006.

Rural Infrastructure Improvement  \n \n10.  Rural infrastructure activities will include (i) irrigation rehabilitation and upgrading, (ii) \nrural road and market improvement, and (iii) special initiatives to ensure the poor participate \nequitably and safely in subproject benefits.6 Using the provincial development plans as a basis, \nthe top five subprojects for each province were pre-screened and prioritized during project \npreparation activities.7 Each of the participating provinces will implement two or three of the top \npriority subprojects. The final list of subprojects will be determined after the feasibility studies, \nusing rigorous eligibility safeguard, technical, economic, and social criteria.8 The top priority \nsubprojects feature irrigation and drainage schemes with an aggregate command (or drainage) \narea of approximately 12,400 ha and road links of an aggregate length of approximately 600 \nkm. \n \n2.  Improved Capacities for Project Management and for Rural Infrastructure \nUse and Sustainability  \n \n11.  Capacity building activities will cover line agency staff and other stakeholders involved in \nproject implementation as well as those people responsible for the operation and maintenance \nof  infrastructure  managed  by  the  DARDs.    They  will  be  implemented  through  (i)  training \nworkshops at national and provincial levels; (ii) the preparation of training materials  and the \ndelivery of the same; (iii) overseas study tours to better appreciate how implementation issues \nare dealt with in other countries of the region; (iv) the provision of consulting services to support \nproject  implementation  and  to  oversee  the  training  program;  (v)  follow  up  training  impact \nsurveys to assist in improving the impact of the training methods, and (vi) on-the-job training \nduring implementation activities. \n \n12.  This component will equip project implementation staff with the necessary skills and \nknowledge  of  government  and  ADB  procedures  to  recruit  the  various  consulting  services, \nmanage construction contracts, satisfy progress reporting obligations to the government and \nADB, and conduct sound financial management of imprest accounts. It will also provide support \nto meet incremental staff costs, vehicles, office equipment, air and land travel, per diem, office \noperating costs, and, where necessary, the rehabilitation of government office facilities for \nproject use.  \n \n13.   In addition, it will include the training of staff from agencies responsible for the operation \nand maintenance of the improved infrastructure using whole-life asset management planning. \nThe project will support the development of a district database of infrastructure assets managed \nby the DARDs and assistance in the preparation of whole-life maintenance plans. Capacity \nbuilding activities will also include measures to increase road safety awareness for vulnerable \nroad users along rehabilitated and upgraded rural roads.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $138 million (Table 1). \n \n                                                 \n6  Such activities will include intensified agriculture extension activities, market training (including numeracy and \nlanguage training) and the provision of footpaths and trails leading off from subproject roads. \n7  List of Eligible Subprojects (Appendix 2).  \n8  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Interest during construction under the ADF hard-term facility has been \ncomputed at 2.2% for the entire loan period. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.  The  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR \n54,116,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (regular terms) and (ii) a loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR17,159,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (hard-term \nfacility) to help finance the project. The regular Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan will have a \n32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe loan agreement. The ADF hard-term loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years, and an interest rate of 2.2% per annum. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s total contribution to the project cost will thus be $108.00 million, 78.3% of total \nproject cost. The bulk of the proceeds of these loans (excluding the funds for national capacity \nbuilding and project coordination) will be passed to the 15 participating provincial governments \nby the national government as a grant.  \n \n17.  The balance of the project cost, $30.00 million equivalent, or 21.7% of total project cost, \nwill be funded by the government from its own budget and will cover taxes and duties, staff \nsalaries, and the recruitment of national safeguard consultants for subproject feasibility studies, \ndetailed design, bidding document preparation, and construction supervision. Taxes and duties \non civil works, and vehicles and equipment to be used in the provinces will be funded by the \nparticipating provinces.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MARD will be the executing agency and will delegate responsibility for overall project  ", "    5 \ncoordination to its Agriculture Projects Management Board, which will establish a central project \nmanagement unit (CPMU) responsible for national project management and coordination.  \n \n19.  Consistent with the government\u2019s desire to decentralize project implementation to the \nprovinces, the provincial people\u2019s committees will be the implementing agencies, acting through \ntheir provincial departments of agriculture and rural development (DARDs). Each DARD will \nestablish a provincial project management unit (PPMU). The PPMUs will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  management  of  subproject  implementation  in  the  provinces,  and  will  carry  out \nfeasibility studies and implement the subprojects.  \n \n20.  The  project  will  coordinate  closely  with  existing  local  administrations,  using  the \ncommune people's committee as the point of liaison. PPMUs will work in close cooperation with \ncommune personnel, who will be responsible for ensuring coordination of day-to-day activities \nbetween the project and commune authorities. This will include organizing public consultations \nand  also  providing  assistance  to  the  commune  supervision  board  to  ensure  commune \nparticipation in subproject design and implementation.9 A budgetary allocation has been made \nto assist in meeting facilitation and coordination costs in each of the participating districts where \nsubprojects are to be implemented. \n \n21.  The subprojects will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, each province will \nimplement their top two priorities. In the second phase, remaining resources will be allocated to \nthe provinces for the construction of additional subprojects as they successfully complete first \nphase subprojects. Better performing provinces will have a chance to implement additional \nsubprojects.  Further  implementation  arrangements  including  subproject  implementation \nprocedures and feasibility criteria are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual.10  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2011\u2013December 2016 (6 years) \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2016 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n(ii)   Key implementing  Provincial people\u2019s committees for Bac Giang, Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Dien Bien, Ha \nagencies  Giang, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Lang Son, Lao Cai, Phu Tho, Son La, Thai Nguyen, \nTuyen Quang, Vinh Phuc, and Yen Bai provinces \n(iii)  Implementation unit  Central project management unit to be located in Ha Noi (30 staff) \nProvincial project management units to be located in each provincial capital (minimum \n10 staff each) \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  150 contracts  $93.47 million \nShopping  48 contracts  $2.00 million \nGovernment procedures  425 contracts  $10.89 million (wholly funded \nfrom the government\u2019s own \nresources) \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  347 person- $4.00 million \nselection (80:20)  months \n  Consultants\u2019 qualification  7 contracts  $0.60 million \nselection \nAdvance action  Consultant selection procedures for loan implementation consultants will be \nundertaken up to the short-listing stage prior to loan effectiveness. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n \n                                                 \n9  The commune supervision boards will include at least one women\u2019s representative. \n10  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n22.  The subprojects involve the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing rural infrastructure. \nThe technology for undertaking such works is within the capacity of the provincial government \nagencies  assigned  to  implement  them,  although,  due  to  the  mountainous  terrain,  greater \nattention to design and implementation quality will be needed. The focus of the civil works \nimplementation will be on quality rather than maximizing coverage, and designs will be based \non appropriate standards to ensure sustainability.  \n \n23.  The main policy concern for rural infrastructure is the issue of sustainability. The key \nproblem with achieving sustainability is the lack of maintenance capacity, including defined \norganizational responsibilities and accountability, as well as a stable and adequate flow of funds. \nThe government has a financing mechanism for irrigation maintenance. However, it does not \ngenerate adequate funds. To make full use of the limited funds, the capacity building component \nincludes training in operation and maintenance for the end users of the upgraded infrastructure \nand an asset management initiative for irrigation schemes. This will lead to a more efficient and \ncost-effective use of the funds. Operation and maintenance budgets are inadequate to cover all \nroads under provincial responsibility. However, the participating provinces have committed to \nproviding funds for maintenance of the roads to be upgraded by the project. Also, to reduce \nfuture  maintenance  burdens  the  project  aims  at  initial  robust  design  and  ensuring  good \nconstruction quality. In the near future, the government plans to establish a road fund that will \ninclude a dedicated percentage for rural roads. The project will register the road improvements \nwith  the  provincial  departments  of  transport  to  ensure  their  inclusion  in  the  maintenance \nprogram. The project will coordinate with the local districts and communes to establish market \nmanagement arrangements for market improvements. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Based on the economic analysis of two representative subprojects (irrigation and rural \nroads), the project will generate a satisfactory economic return from the investments. Better \nwater  management  and  infrastructure  will  lead  to  incremental  productivity  increases  and \ndiversification into produce that yield higher returns. Rehabilitated rural roads will reduce vehicle \noperating  costs,  reduce  travel  times  between  destinations,  and  induce  increased  crop \nproduction due to higher farm-gate prices for agricultural produce and improved access to \nproduction  inputs.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  representative \nsubprojects are 13.0% for irrigation and 13.4% for rural roads. In each case, the benefits are \nrobust  to  commodity  price  decreases,  to  decreasing  utilization  rates  and  to  increased \ninvestment cost.  \n \n25.  Financial benefits to households will be significant in terms of the opportunities created. \nIndividuals  will  not  contribute  to  investment  costs  but  will  only  contribute  direct  inputs  to \nproduction, and will enjoy the direct and indirect benefits. The distribution analysis confirms that \nthe poor will benefit significantly and proportionally from subproject investments.11 \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  All procurement to be financed by ADB loan funds will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). MARD has indicated that \nit will ensure that all accounts administered by the CPMU and PPMUs are consolidated and \naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The project will strengthen the capacities of \nCPMU and PPMU staff in financial management procedures to allow the efficient operation of \n                                                 \n11  Economic and Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). ", "    7 \nadvance accounts and the reporting of financial performance to the government and ADB. \nImplementation of the project will be consistent with the government\u2019s requirement for provincial \nimplementation under national coordination. Where possible, the involvement of district and \nlower level administrations and communities will be sought to effect their participation in design \nand  construction  monitoring.  The  project  will  also  establish  a  website  to  (i)  disclose \nimplementation progress and bid notifications and their results, and (ii) provide a grievance \nmechanism against any corrupt practice. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MARD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.12 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Poverty levels among direct beneficiaries of subprojects range from 25% to 60%. The \nmajority of subprojects have a poverty level of over 40%, compared with an overall national \nfigure of 11% in 2008. As evidenced by past successful ADB interventions, improving access to \nresources,  inputs,  services  and  market  opportunities,  the  project  is  expected  to  have  a \nsignificant  impact  in  reducing  poverty  throughout  the  subproject  areas  and  beyond.  Direct \nbeneficiaries will include residents in the subproject areas. The rural road improvements will \nalso generate indirect beneficiaries by increasing the overall catchment area and efficiency of \nthe rural transport networks. The project is classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming\u201d under \nADB\u2019s gender mainstreaming categories. The majority of women in the project area are active in \nagriculture but also undertake about 80% of domestic chores. The project will provide women in \nthe target communities with improved infrastructure that will enable increased productivity and \nincomes, empowerment through participation in project decision-making, reduced work burdens, \noff-farm income earning opportunities, and improved access to educational, health and social \nservices. To ensure benefits accrue to women, a gender action plan has been prepared.13  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment (category B). The project is unlikely to cause significant environmental \ndamage since the subprojects are mainly limited to improving existing infrastructure. Moreover, \nsubprojects have been screened to exclude those that may cause significant damage. The \nenvironmental assessment and review framework provides guidance for the government to \ncarry out an appropriate level of environmental assessment and to take measures to deal with \nthese impacts.14  \n \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  No  resettlement  is  expected  because  the \nmajority of infrastructure, irrigation, and roads will be improved along existing rights of way. As a \nresult, the main concern will be the provision of compensation for roadside trees, crops or small \nstructures. The absence of major resettlement issues was one of the eligibility criteria used in \nselecting subprojects. The government and ADB have agreed on a resettlement framework \nalong  with  procedures  and  an  outline  format  for  a  resettlement  plan.15 Compensation, \nallowances,  operation  and  administration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be \nfinanced from government counterpart funds. A qualified institution or firm acceptable to ADB \nwill be contracted by the government to conduct independent external monitoring and evaluation \nof the resettlement process and impacts. \n \n                                                 \n12  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n13  Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n14  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (Appendix 2). \n15  Resettlement Framework (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n31.  Indigenous  peoples (category B).  Ethnic minorities are expected to be among the \nmajor beneficiaries of the project. The government and ADB have agreed on an indigenous \npeoples planning framework. For most subprojects, where the majority of beneficiaries are from \nethnic minorities and where subproject impacts are expected to be wholly positive, measures to \nimprove the welfare of indigenous peoples and protection of their rights are included in the \nsubproject design. In other subprojects, combined resettlement and ethnic minority development \nplans will be prepared. An important aspect of the project will be the use of the commune \nsupervision board to ensure local peoples\u2019 participation in subproject design and construction \nsupervision.

The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n34.
