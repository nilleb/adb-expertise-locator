The  report  also  describes  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the \nPacific 1  for  Regional  Capacity  Development  for  Strengthened  HIV  Response.  If  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan  and  grant,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, will approve the TA. \n \nThe  project2 will  support  the  governments  of  the Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam  to  strengthen \n2. \nthe  regional  HIV  response  by  addressing  current  gaps  in  effectively  reaching  high-risk  and \nvulnerable  populations  in  border  areas  along  economic  corridors  in  the  GMS.  The  aim  is  to \ndevelop  national  and  regional  capacity  to  mitigate  HIV  risks  and  vulnerability  resulting  from \nincreased  mobility,  migration  and  rapid  economic  development  in  the  region.3 The  project  will \nfurther  enhance  regional  HIV  response  capacity,  including  strengthening  regional  cooperation \nand targeted interventions for migrants and mobile populations in cross-border areas. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\n3. \nThe  GMS  is  a  fast-growing  subregion  in  terms  of  economic  development.  GMS \ninvestments  in  transport  corridors  and  trade  agreements  have  improved  regional  connectivity \nand integration, thereby attracting more investment and facilitating the movement of people and \ngoods  across  borders.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  programs  continue  to  give \nhigh  priority  to  supporting  enhanced  connectivity  as  a  driver  of  continued  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  GMS.  Better  regional  connectivity  and  economic  integration  also  increase \nmobility  and  migration,  which  contribute  to  increased  HIV  risks  and  vulnerability,  especially \nalong newly developed economic corridors with high population mobility.4 The epidemics in the \nregion  are  mainly  driven  by  key  populations  with  high-risk  behaviors\u2014such  as  injecting  drug \nusers, female sex workers (FSWs) and their clients, and men who have sex with men5\u2014whose \nmembers are being increasingly drawn to border regions alongside migrant labor to benefit from \nnew  opportunities.  This  mobility  is  associated  with  the  development  of  new  concentrations  of \nhigh-risk  and  vulnerable  groups;  the  risk  of  transmission  expands  to  their  intimate  partners, \nthereby increasing the risk that HIV prevalence will increase instead of being contained. \n \n4. \nThe HIV epidemic in the GMS is diverse. The epidemic varies in prevalence and nature \nacross  the  countries,  and  occurs  in  pockets  within  countries.  The  border  regions  include  the \nmost  physically  and  socially  isolated  and  least  economically  developed  communities,  and \ncontain the highest concentrations of poorly educated people who have limited knowledge and \nawareness of HIV risks; they also have very limited access to services. Increasing injecting drug \n                                                 \n1  Contributor: the Government of Sweden. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB 2010.

Manila. \n\n3  Vulnerability  refers  to  unequal  opportunities,  social  exclusion,  and  other  social,  cultural,  political,  and  economic \nfactors  that  make  a  person  more  susceptible  to  HIV/AIDS.  The  factors  underlying  vulnerability  may  reduce  the \nability of individuals and communities to avoid HIV risk. \n\n4  ADB. 2007.

An \ninadequate HIV response will continue to offset the gains made to date in poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth as a result of investment in infrastructure and regional integration.  \n \n5. \nThe  HIV  epidemic  in  Viet  Nam  remains  in  a  concentrated  stage  with  the  adult  HIV \nprevalence at 0.45% in 2011.7  There are signs that it may have begun to stabilize during 2010\u2013\n2011,8 however,  according  to  2011  sentinel  surveillance,  HIV  prevalence  remains  high  among \nFSWs (3%), injecting drug users (13.4%), and men who have sex with men (16.7%). Viet Nam \nis committed to halting and reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, and the fifth draft of the Viet Nam \nNational HIV/AIDS Strategy aims for nationwide prevention and care coverage, and reaching all \ncommunes.  Due  to  resource  constraints,  the  focus  to  date  has  been  on  targeting  high-risk \npopulations in the major cities and urban centers, where the HIV prevalence is higher. However, \nthe  epidemic  has  spread  to  all  districts,  and  is  increasing  in  particular  in  border  districts.  The \nextent of the potential for growth in the epidemic is uncertain due to weak surveillance systems. \nAs of 31 December 2011, there were 197,335 reported cases of people living with HIV. Officials \nin Viet Nam agree that a large number of people living with HIV may be missed, in particular in \nborder districts that lack the effective surveillance systems.  \n \nIn the Lao PDR, HIV prevalence in 2011 remains low (0.2%) in the adult population, but \n6. \nthis does not translate to a low risk. The Lao PDR is surrounded by countries with higher HIV \nprevalence.  Increased  mobility  across  borders  coupled  with  the  existing  risks  and  vulnerability \nfrom  commercial  sex  and  the  emergence  of  high-risk  populations  creates  a  high-risk \nenvironment,  especially  in  the  border  districts.9 In response to  its precarious  HIV  situation, the \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  provided  strong  political  commitment  to  a  multi-sectoral \nresponse with support from international and national partners. Priorities include establishment \nof legislation; focused resource generation for expansion of HIV prevention, care and treatment \nprograms to targeted populations; and strengthened civil society participation in HIV response. \n \n7. \nThree main gaps that need to be addressed to contain the epidemic have been identified \nas  common  to  the  existing  systems  in  both  countries. 10  First,  current  health  systems  are \ninefficient in effectively planning and managing HIV/AIDS response due to the limited capacity \nof health staff at provincial and local levels, and weak monitoring and surveillance systems for \nHIV transmission at the village level; to address this, new investment and capacity building are \nneeded  to  increase  health  expenditure,  strengthen  system  planning  and  management,  and \nexpand  human  resources  and  skills.  Second,  access  to  quality  prevention  and  care  services \ncontinues  to  be  a  major  concern  for  people  vulnerable  to  HIV  transmission,  because  of \ninadequate  equipment  and  medical  supplies  and  a  shortage  of  trained  health  staff  to  provide \nquality  services;  in  response,  investment  needs  to  be  directed  to  tackling  inequity  and \nimbalances  in  service  delivery  in  the  poorer  districts,  and  to  continue  modernizing  service \ndelivery  models  to  improve  effectiveness  and  efficiency.  Third,  awareness  of  HIV risks  among \nhigh-risk  and  vulnerable  populations,  including  migrants  and  mobile  populations,  remains  low \n\n                                                 \n6  United  Nations  Regional  Taskforce  on  Mobility  and  HIV  Vulnerability  Reduction  in  Southeast  Asia  and  Southern  \nProvinces in China. 2008.

Leaders of \nthe  GMS  countries  have  given  high  priority  to  the  control  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  signed  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  in  December  2011  for  Joint  Action  to  Reduce  HIV \nVulnerability Related to Population Movement in the GMS. A multisectoral approach to tackling \nHIV/AIDS is being promoted in the GMS countries, with HIV/AIDS integrated into broader health \nstrategies as well as other sector strategies (e.g., for infrastructure and transport).  \n \nBoth the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam continue to be highly dependent on \n9. \ndonor  assistance  to  finance  system  development  and  some  recurrent  costs,  and  supplement \ncapital investment. Support from bilateral partners has been declining, and as external aid  for \nHIV  response  is  scaled  back,  it  is  essential  to  give  renewed  priority  to  new  systemic  capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  future  sustainability.  Both  governments  seek  to  decentralize  the  HIV \nresponse to the local level in order to provide more effective services, but lack the knowledge, \nmanagement skills and systems, and resources to implement decentralization effectively.  \n \n10. \nSince  1997,  ADB  has  supported  several  HIV  prevention  projects  in  the  GMS,  some  in \nassociation with infrastructure projects. Outputs have ranged from support for community-based \nHIV  prevention  to  regional  policy  development  for  cross-border  cooperation,  with  a  particular \nfocus on regional aspects of HIV, including migrants and mobile populations, large construction \nsites, and source communities of migrants.11 GMS projects have supported the development of \ntargeted  prevention  messages  to  ethnic  minority  communities,  especially  in  remote  and \ncross-border  areas,12 to  a  youth-focused  project  in  Viet  Nam,13 and  to  regional  communicable \ndisease control projects.14 Since 2008, regional TA has supported the development of a regional \npolicy for cross-border collaboration and implementation of HIV prevention packages associated \nwith a number of GMS transport projects.15 The projects and TA have expanded the knowledge \nbase  for  actions  in  these  areas  and  provided  ADB  with  experience  in  effective  regional  and \ncountry-level HIV programming.  \n \nImportant  lessons  have  been  learned  in  implementing  HIV/AIDS-specific  projects,  and \n11. \nhealth projects in general. These projects demonstrated the importance of targeting vulnerable \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2001.

ADB  supports  a  comprehensive \napproach  to  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  treatment,  care  and  support  delivered  across  a  continuum \nfrom  hospitals  to  communities,  and  works  closely  with  development  partners  to  assist  the \ngovernments  to  adopt  harmonized  HIV  prevention  activities.  It  is  important  to  mainstream  HIV \nstrategies  into  ministerial  plans  and  to  integrate  HIV  project  activities  into  annual  operational \nplans  to  improve  results  and  sustainability.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional \nCommunicable  Disease  Control  Project  (footnote  14)  was  instrumental  in  strengthening \nprovincial  capacity  for  timely  outbreak  control  for  avian  influenza  and  dengue,  reducing  the \nburden  of  neglected  tropical  diseases,  and  tackling  HIV/AIDS  and  improving  regional \ncoordination.  The  project  will  benefit  from  existing  project  management  capacity  and  regional \ncooperation  mechanisms  developed  by  the  Second  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional \nCommunicable  Diseases  Control  Project  (footnote  14)  to  reduce  start-up  delays.  Regional \ncooperation  and  knowledge  management  will  further  strengthen  institutional  capacity  of  the \nministries of health (MOHs) in both countries. \n \n12. \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  has  been  identified  as  a  priority  regional  public  good  by  Strategy \n2020.16 The project is fully in line with the ADB's Strategic Directions Paper on HIV/AIDS 2011\u2013\n201517 and  supports mitigation  of  HIV/AIDS  risks and  vulnerabilities  along  economic  corridors, \nwhich is one of the three priority areas for ADB\u2019s HIV/AIDS response in the region. The project \nis  aligned  with  the  operational  plans  for  health  and  transport18 to  support  social  sustainability \nand social risk mitigation associated with transport operations. Furthermore, addressing health \nand  other  social  issues  associated  with  subregional  connectivity  is  identified  as  one  of  the \nstrategic  pillars  for  ADB's  regional  cooperation  business  plan  for  the  GMS,  2012\u20132014.19 The \nproject  is  anchored  on  the  overall  objective  of  the  MOU  for  Joint  Action  to  Reduce  HIV \nVulnerability  Related  to  Population  Movement  in  the  GMS,  and  ADB  is  actively  supporting \nimplementation  through  various  GMS  initiatives,  along  with  other  development  partners  (i.e., \nJoint  United  Nations  Programme  on  AIDS,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  the \nWorld  Health Organization,  the International  Organization  for  Migration, the  Australian  Agency \nfor  International  Development,  and  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency).  The  project  aims  to  address  a  critical  gap  in  the  current  response  to  HIV  (which  is \nlargely  focused  on  national  HIV  response  systems)  by  enhancing  the  regional  response \ncapacity  to  effectively  reach  migrants  and  mobile  populations,  who  face  increased  risk  and \nvulnerability in a rapidly changing social and economic environment in the GMS.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  impact  is  to  contribute  to  achieving  and  sustaining  the  Millennium \n13. \nDevelopment Goal to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Lao PDR \nand  Viet  Nam. The  expected  outcome  of the  project  will  be  increased  coverage  and quality  of \nservices for targeted populations in 23 border provinces.20 The project has four outputs.21 \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2008.

The  TA \nwill also support knowledge-sharing activities involving neighboring countries in the region. The \nTA  is  closely  linked  with  ADB\u2019s  initiatives  to  building  regional  capacity  to  reduce  HIV \nvulnerability  in  the  GMS.  The  outcome  will  be  a  strengthened  regional  HIV  response  system. \nThe TA  will  have  three  outputs: (i)  capacity  building for regional  planning  and  management of \nHIV programs, (ii) pilot-testing of service delivery models for improved access to and quality of \n                                                 \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8\n \n\n \n\nHIV services for migrants and mobile populations at border areas, and (iii) shared knowledge on \nregional cooperation on HIV prevention and management.24 \n \n22. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nCooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (footnote 1), and administered \nby ADB. The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation and local transport, the value of which is estimated at 15% (in-kind) of the total \nTA cost. Individual consultants (60 person-months, including 20 person-months of international \nand  40  person-months  of  national  consultant  services)  and  a  nongovernment  organization  or \nfirm  will  be  engaged  to  support  planning,  implementation,  coordination,  and  monitoring  of \nregional  HIV  initiatives. The consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over \n24 months, commencing in January 2013 and ending by December 2014. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n23. \nTechnical  challenges  include  (i)  strengthening  regional  cooperation  and  knowledge \nmanagement  on  a  sustainable  basis;  (ii)  access  to  border  districts  and  communities;                \n(iii) community-based BCC and care; and (iv) integrating cross-border cooperation, training and \nsocial  safeguards  in  provincial  planning  and  budgeting.  The  project  provides  for  capacity \nbuilding and initial support in these areas, and also includes several assurances. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nBenefits include a decrease in the burden of HIV, and improved overall health status of \npeople in participating provinces and districts. Other benefits come from lower private and public \nhealth  expenditures,  including  indirect  costs  resulting  from  reduced  morbidity  and  productivity \ngains from increased lifespan and reduced mortality. Poor and vulnerable populations, including \nethnic groups living in border areas, will particularly benefit. The project is pro-poor in its focus \non  delivering  and  expanding  healthcare  services  in  districts  and  communes.  The  estimated \neconomic internal rate of return is 14.3% for the Lao PDR and 12.7% for Viet Nam, with benefits \nderived from reduced medical treatment costs and productivity losses.25  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  MOHs  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam  have  gained  substantial  experience  in \n25. \nimplementing  ADB-assisted  projects,  and  have  staff  with  skills  and  experience  in  ADB \nprocedures.  The  financial  management  assessments  confirmed  that  each  MOH  has  adequate \ncapacity for financial management for project implementation. There were no major governance \nissues  during  the  implementation  of  other  ADB  financed  projects.  Staff  will  be  provided  with \norientation courses in governance. The governments will maintain a project website and post all \nprocurement  activities  on  this  website.  ADB's  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  governments.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n\n                                                 \n24 Technical  Assistance:  Regional  Capacity  Development  for  Strengthened  HIV  Response  Project  (accessible  from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26.  \nPoverty  and  social  impacts.  The  targeted  border  districts  have  a  high  proportion  of \nfamilies  living  below  or  near  the  poverty  line  who  depend  heavily  on  the  availability  within  the \nfamily  of  a  healthy  labor  force.  Life-threatening  disease  or  death  in  families  creates  deeper \npoverty. Populations in border districts are increasingly vulnerable to the risk of communicable \ndiseases,  and  have  less  information  and  access  to  services  to  reduce  the  risks.  By  helping \nimprove  regional  health  and  economic  security,  the  project  will  protect  the  poor  against  HIV-\nrelated catastrophic events, and improve their health, learning and productivity.26    \n \nE. \n\nGender impacts \n\nThe key gender impacts of the project include (i) an inclusive and participatory approach \n27.  \nto  developing  local  HIV/AIDS  interventions; (ii)  increased  awareness  by health  staff  of the key \ngender issues and enhanced capacity at the provincial and district levels to provide HIV and STI \nservices;  (iii)  increased  knowledge  among  FSWs,  female  migrants,  and  ethnic  women  on  HIV \ntransmission  and  means  of  prevention;  and  (iv)  an  increase  in  the  number  of  at-risk  females \ntested  for  HIV  infection.  The  gender  action  plans  for  both  countries  ensure  that  (i)  the \nvulnerability mapping and knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys will integrate gender issues \nand  report  sex-disaggregated  data;  (ii)  gender  issues  related  to  high-risk  groups  will  be \nintegrated into all training and BCC materials developed; (iii) 100% of female managers will be \ntrained on planning and management tools; (iv) 50% of local staff will be trained on HIV and STI \nservices  are  to  be  female;  (v)  mobile  clinic  services  will  be  provided  in  sites  with  a  high \nconcentration of FSWs and migrant women, as well as for remote ethnic populations; and (vi) all \nquality  assurance  tools  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  integrate  gender  issues  and \nindicators,  and  assess  gender  sensitive  service  delivery  and  monitor  the  number  of  women \naccessing  HIV  services.  The  gender  action  plan  is  aligned  with  national-  and  sector-specific \ngender  equality  commitments  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam.27 The  project  is  classified  as \nhaving gender equity as a theme. \n \nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project  includes  a  significant  proportion  of  ethnic  groups  among  its  beneficiaries, \n28.  \nwho  are  among  some  of  the  poorest  and  most  marginalized  households  in  the  Lao  PDR  and \nViet Nam. The ethnic groups plan28 ensures ethnic peoples\u2019 needs will be analyzed and they will \nparticipate  in  and  have  access  to  project  benefits.  Key  features  of  the  plan  include                      \n(i)  consultation  with  ethnic  groups  on  the  development  of  provincial  HIV  plans,  (ii)  mapping  of \nrisk  behaviors  of  ethnic  groups  by  gender  and  age,  (iii)  integrating  ethnicity  issues  and  needs \ninto all training and BCC materials developed for service providers and ethnic populations, (iii) a \ntarget  of  100%  participation  of  ethnic  health  staff  at  all  levels  in  any  training  provided  by  the \nproject, and (iv) monitoring of the proportion of ethnic people accessing services relative to the \ntotal population of the ethnic community. The project is classified as category B for indigenous \npeoples, and category C for environment and involuntary resettlement. \n\nG. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.
