THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof $500 million to Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), with a sovereign \nguarantee from India, for the Green Energy Corridor and Grid Strengthening Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will finance power transmission system upgrades in India, including (i) a \nportion of the Government of India\u2019s Green Energy Corridor initiative to facilitate the transfer of \npower from renewable energy-rich areas to other parts of the country, through 765 kilovolt (kV) \nand 400 kV high-voltage transmission lines and an associated 765/400 kV substation and \nequipment; and (ii) four high-voltage direct current (HVDC) terminals (two at 800 kV and two at \n320 kV) to increase interregional connectivity between India\u2019s western and southern regional \npower grids.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  India suffers from an unreliable power supply that inhibits its economic growth potential \nby constraining commercial activities. About 300 million citizens have no access to electricity, \nwhile  some  areas  face  daily  power  outages  due  to  a  lack  of  supply  and  transmission \nbottlenecks.3 The government is scaling up investments in the generation, transmission, and \ndistribution subsectors to address these issues. India is also promoting increased use of clean \nrenewable energy, universal electricity access, and energy self-sufficiency by supplementing \nconventional power-generation sources (oil, gas, and coal). This includes ambitious renewable \nenergy targets in the electricity-generation mix. As of 31 July 2015, India had an installed \ngenerating capacity of 275.9 GW, of which 36.5 GW was renewable energy.4 In 2015, the \nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) announced state-level renewable energy-\ncapacity targets for 2022 with a national aggregate of 175 GW, with about 90% from solar and \nwind sources.5 \n \n4.  Green  Energy  Corridor  initiative.  In  2012,  MNRE  and  the  Forum  of  Regulators6 \ncommissioned POWERGRID to conduct a green energy corridor study to identify nationwide \ntransmission investments required to accommodate the additional renewable energy-generation \ncapacity.7 Almost  60%  of  this  renewable  energy  capacity  is  located  in  six  states\u2014Andhra \nPradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. To facilitate the transfer \nof power from these renewable energy-rich states to others, as well as the absorption of power \nand addressing renewable energy intermittency and timing differences, POWERGRID identified \n$7 billion in investments to be undertaken in phases, starting under the Twelfth Five Year Plan. \nThese include (i) intrastate transmission investments of about $3.6 billion within renewable \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2013.

", "2   \nenergy-rich states and (ii) phased interstate investments of more than $3.4 billion to enable \npower flows across states over long distances. \n \n5.  Expanded interregional connectivity.  India\u2019s national transmission grid is divided into \nfive  regions.8 Synchronous  interconnectivity  previously  existed  only  between  the  northern, \neastern,  western,  and  northeastern  regions.  On  31  December  2013,  POWERGRID \ncommissioned an  interconnection  between  the southern  and  western regions  that  enabled \nsynchronous operation of an interconnected national power grid. This not only augmented the \ninterregional power transfer capacity of southern states, but also relieved congestion in some \ntransmission corridors. Southern states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, \nhave been particularly troubled by power shortages. A more resilient regional and interregional \ngrid is essential in facilitating power transfers among states and regions. Furthermore, daily \npeak power demand does not occur simultaneously in all regions. One state or region may have \na power surplus while another faces a deficit. Hence, an integrated national grid facilitates           \n(i) power transfers from areas with a surplus to those with a deficit, (ii) optimization of the power \nsystem by integrating the electricity market and encouraging power trading, and (iii) competitive \nelectricity prices and improved power supply mix through greater use of renewable energy. \nInterregional power transfer capacity as of 31 December 2014 was 46.5 GW and is envisaged \nto increase to 72.3 GW by 2017.9  \n \n6.  Borrower. POWERGRID, India\u2019s national power transmission company, is responsible \nfor  planning,  developing,  and  operating  the  high-voltage  interstate  and  interregional  power \ntransmission  network.10 POWERGRID  operates  about  90%  of  the  country\u2019s  interstate  and \ninterregional  transmission  networks\u2014consisting  of  117,679  circuit  kilometers  (km)  of \ntransmission lines and 197 transmission substations with a transformation capacity of about \n239,424 megavolt-amperes  as of 31 July 2015\u2014and provides nondiscriminatory open access \nto its transmission system for any licensed utility or generating company.11 POWERGRID has a \nsound  implementation  record  in  upgrading  and  strengthening  the  national  high-voltage \ntransmission network, with consistent good operational performance evidenced by transmission \nnetwork availability of above 99% for the past 5 years.  \n \n7.  Project  design.  POWERGRID\u2019s  immediate  investment  plans  consist  of  the  Green \nEnergy Corridor initiative\u2019s interstate portions, including a high-capacity transmission corridor \nconnecting  major  renewable  energy  pockets  from  Gujarat  in  the  western  region  through \nRajasthan to Punjab state in the northern region. This project will fund a portion of these \ninterstate investments, consisting of two 765 kV alternating current transmission lines, one 400 \nkV alternating current transmission line, and one 765/400 kV substation in Rajasthan state \nconnecting  to  a  765/400  kV  substation  in  Punjab  state,  including  a  real-time  system  for \nmeasuring  and  monitoring  power  flows.  Other  portions  of  the  initiative  are  funded  by  the \nGerman development cooperation through KfW for \u20ac500 million (about $556 million equivalent) \nthat  will  be  recognized  through  a  memorandum  of  understanding  as  parallel  collaborative \ncofinancing.12 A separate project component will further increase interregional transmission \ncapacity between the western and the southern regional grids as part of a high-priority HVDC \n                                                \n8  The five regions are the northern, eastern, southern, western, and northeastern regions. \n9  Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Power.  Creation  of  a  National  Grid.  New  Delhi. \n(http://powermin.nic.in/transmission-0) \n10 As of 30 June 2015, the Government of India owned 57.9% of POWERGRID, which makes the company majority \nstate-owned and therefore a public sector undertaking. \n11 POWERGRID.

", "  3 \n \ntransmission link, since the southern region has an 11.3% overall deficit and a 19.8% peak \npower deficit, while the western region is in surplus. The envisaged southern region generation-\ncapacity additions are not sufficient, and increased transmission capacity is therefore required. \nThis component consists of two 800 kV HVDC terminals\u2014one in Chhattisgarh (western region) \nand the other in Tamil Nadu (southern region)\u2014and two 320 kV HVDC terminals connecting \nKerala and Tamil Nadu. This will expand western\u2013southern interconnectivity from 10 GW to 16 \nGW between Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu, and the portion between Tamil Nadu and Kerala will \nhave 2 GW capacity. The adoption of HVDC transmission technology improves power transfer \nefficiency and reduces transmission losses over long distances. It is thus a least-cost solution \nand low-carbon investment option well suited for high-capacity interregional power transfers.  \n \n8.  Alignment with ADB strategy and operations.  Supporting the Green Energy Corridor \ninitiative  and  financing  transmission  networks  to  increase  interregional  power  flows  are \nconsistent with the Strategy 2020 and Energy Policy, 2009 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  that  advocates  the  promotion  of  renewable  energy,  increased  energy  efficiency, \nimproved energy security, and facilitation of the country\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy.13 \nIt is also consistent with the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 that supports (i) \nclean  and  renewable  energy  expansion;  (ii)  enhanced  energy  efficiency;  (iii)  promotion  of \nadvanced high-voltage transmission technology, including HVDC transmission lines to increase \ntransmission efficiency; and (iv) grid integration of renewable energy.14  \n \n9.  Since 1995, ADB has provided POWERGRID seven sovereign-guaranteed loans and \none nonsovereign loan to strengthen its transmission system nationally. The projects have a \ngood implementation history and high ratings. Among these, ADB provided two loan facilities in \n2011 consisting of a nonsovereign loan and a sovereign-guaranteed loan in a single financing \npackage. 15  The  nonsovereign  loan  represented  POWERGRID\u2019s  first  transaction  without \nsovereign support, and helped POWERGRID diversify its financing sources.  \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. Renewable energy-based power generation is still \nmore expensive than conventional coal-fired power generation in India and poses an additional \ncost burden due to its power intermittency. The government\u2019s intervention through the Electricity \nAct, 2003, the National Action Plan on Climate Change, and the Jawaharlal Nehru National \nSolar Mission has created the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks and incentives to \nattract private sector investments into the sector, thereby capturing the environmental benefits \nof renewable energy projects. However, the public sector is responsible for ensuring timely \ninvestments in transmission networks to allow for increased renewable energy penetration. In \nthis context, POWERGRID\u2019s near-term funding needs for the interstate green energy corridor \nexceed $3.4 billion, whereas for enhanced overall interregional connectivity\u2014critical not just for \nrenewable energy but for bulk power evacuation and power system optimization\u2014it requires a \nfurther $10 billion.16 The previous ADB sovereign and nonsovereign loans helped POWERGRID \ndiversify  its  funding  sources.  POWERGRID  will  continue  to  access  all  available  sources, \nincluding  domestic  and  international  banks,  capital  markets,  and  multilateral  and  other \ndevelopment  financial  institutions,  including  ADB  to  fund  its  capital  investment  plans.  To \nmaintain affordability, POWERGRID must more closely match its funding sources\u2019 tenors to the \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s assistance thus plays an important role \nin  financing  India\u2019s  power  transmission  components  that  are  critical  in  achieving  the \ngovernment\u2019s  renewable  energy  targets,  as  well  as  increasing  overall  interregional \ninterconnection capacity. Without this, (i) significant additional generation capacity cannot be \ntransferred, (ii) renewable and conventional energy project bankability becomes a challenge, (iii) \npower trading will not expand, and (iv) continued increases in access to affordable power will \nnot materialize. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be increased overall efficiency of the Indian power system, expanded \naccess to electricity, increased private investment in renewable energy, and enhanced energy \nsecurity in India. The outcome will be improved and more reliable transmission system capacity \nin the northern, western, and southern regions of India. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  These will be achieved by 2020 through the following outputs: (i) green energy corridor \ntransmission  system  expanded  in  the  northern  region  and (ii)  transmission  interconnection \ncapacity between the western and southern regions expanded. Investments are as follows: \n(i)  Green energy corridor system expansion in the northern region: \n(a)  765 kV double circuit transmission line from Ajmer to Bikaner (263 km); \n(b)  765 kV double circuit transmission line from Bikaner to Moga (366 km); \n(c)  400 kV double circuit (Quad) transmission line from Bikaner (new substation) to \nBikaner (existing substation)  (26 km); \n(d)  765/400 kV substation with 2x1500 megavolt-ampere transformers at Bikaner; \n(e)  extensions of the existing Ajmer and Moga substations by adding two line bays \nto each; and \n(f)  real-time measurement and monitoring equipment. \n(ii)  Transmission  interconnection  capacity  expansion  between  the  western  and \nsouthern regions: \n(a)  800 kV HVDC terminal stations at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh and Pugalur in \nTamil Nadu; and \n(b)  320 kV voltage source converter HVDC terminal stations at Pugalur in Tamil \nNadu and North Trichur in Kerala. \n \nD.

The project team identified risks associated with the \nfinancing plan, and control mechanisms to address them (footnote 18). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n17.  POWERGRID has in-house planning capabilities, including computer-aided facilities for \ntransmission  system  planning,  design,  operation,  and  maintenance.  POWERGRID\u2019s  green \nenergy corridor study (footnote 7) identified the required investments and estimated capital \nexpenditure to ensure adequate capacity and system reliability to meet India\u2019s demand growth. \nThe MNRE, the Forum of Regulators, and the Central Electricity Authority reviewed data from \nstate transmission utilities and the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. The study also \nincluded power demand projections taken from the 18th Electric Power Survey (2013) of the \nCentral Electricity Authority.  \n \n18.  The  800  kV  HVDC  transmission  system  is  state-of-the-art,  commercially  proven \ntechnology, and is the most cost-effective means of transmitting bulk power over long distances. \nFor  high-capacity,  point-to-point transmission, HVDC  is  economically  preferable  for  system \nlengths  exceeding  700\u2013800  km.

Screening for climate risks was conducted, and risks were assessed as \nlow. Such risks are considered in the project design.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return, calculated on a real basis, is 5.76%\u2014higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital of 3.66%\u2014and remains such in the various adverse \nsensitivity scenarios.19 Its economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 16.60%.20 The \nproject is thus financially viable and economically sustainable. \n \n20.  The  government  has  awarded  POWERGRID  \u201cNavratna\u201d  status,  which  gives  public \nsector undertakings a degree of managerial and financial autonomy despite their  majority-\ngovernment ownership.21 POWERGRID maintains an international long-term issue credit rating \nof BBB\u2013 (Outlook: Stable) from both Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch, and enjoys the highest \ndomestic credit rating of AAA.22 Based on the cost-plus nature of the tariff-setting process \ncoupled with its operating efficiency, POWERGRID has increased revenues and net profits \nconsistently, maintaining a robust financial position with stable cash flows to cover its costs, \ncapital investment, and debt payments. Over the last three years, it achieved a post-tax return \non net worth of over 10.0% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 times. In FY2015, \nthe return on net worth rose to 13.1%23 and the debt service coverage ratio improved to 2.0 \ntimes.24 POWERGRID\u2019s debt\u2013to\u2013equity ratio has remained at approximately 70:30. Although \nPOWERGRID has an aggressive investment plan and a large need for additional borrowings, \nfinancial projections show it has a sound financial position even under stress scenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  As a publicly listed company, POWERGRID is subject to several strong governance \nmeasures imposed by India\u2019s Securities and Exchange Board, which enhance accountability, \ntransparency, and predictability of its financial governance through information disclosure to \nshareholders, investment professionals, and the general public. POWERGRID has an advanced \naccounting system using computerization with confidentiality and integrity at various levels. The \nfinancial management risk is thus low.  \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and POWERGRID. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The power sector is a key driver of India\u2019s economic growth and development. Access to \nreliable,  stable,  and  adequate  electricity  supply  increases  agricultural,  industrial,  and \n                                                \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The nominal financial internal rate \nof return is 10.72%, higher than the nominal weighted average cost of capital of 7.78%. \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Navratna-status public sector undertakings may invest up to less than (i) Rs10 billion or (ii) 15% of net worth on a \nsingle project or 30% of net worth in a single year, without having to seek the government\u2019s permission. \n22 Since 2001, POWERGRID\u2019s domestic bonds have been rated AAA by the Credit Rating Information Services of \nIndia Limited and AAA by the Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited. Since 2008, the \nCredit Analysis and Research has also given these bonds an AAA rating. \n23 POWERGRID. 2015. FY2014\u20132015 Press and Analysts Meet Announcement. Mumbai. \n24 POWERGRID. 2015.

Economic  growth  helps  reduce \npoverty and improve quality of life, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of society. The \n  \nproject will avoid or minimize negative impacts on affected people.25 Social design features \ninclude (i) compensation for loss of crops and trees at market value, (ii) additional assistance for \naffected vulnerable households, and (iii) equal opportunities to access employment and equal \npay for men and women under civil works contracts. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment, category  B  for  involuntary \n \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous people. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), the project\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts and risks have been \nidentified. Measures to avoid, mitigate, and compensate for adverse environmental impacts are \nincorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination,  which  includes  the  environmental \nmanagement plan.26 Environmental impacts of transmission lines can be minimized by careful \nroute  selection.  One  of  the  lines  passes  through  about  0.7  km  of  degraded  forest  land. \nCompensatory  afforestation  required  by  the  government  to  offset  this  impact  is  budgeted. \nPrivate land will be required for the HVDC terminal  in Pugalur, Tamil Nadu, and is being \nacquired  on  a  willing-buyer,  willing-seller  basis  and  through  negotiated  settlement.27 The \nremaining substations are on government or POWERGRID-owned land, for which due diligence \nhas confirmed there are no encroachers or informal settlers and that the land is free of claims \nand disputes. For the transmission towers and lines, impacts are temporary and will occur \nduring construction in loss of crops and trees, which will be compensated. Measures to avoid, \nmitigate, and compensate for adverse impacts are incorporated in a compensation plan for \ntemporary damages, analogous to ADB\u2019s resettlement plan.28 This contains basic elements of a \nresettlement plan, as required by ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement for category B projects, \nand is based on the principles of the Safeguard Policy Statement; the Indian Telegraph Act, \n1885; and the Electricity Act, 2003. POWERGRID has the commitment and ability to manage \nthe social and environmental risks.29Information disclosure to and consultations with affected \n \npeople will be conducted following ADB requirements. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures   \n \n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are shown in Table 4 and further described in the \nrisk  assessment  and risk management  plan.30 The  risks  are manageable,  and  appropriate \nmitigation measures are incorporated. Integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n   \n                                                \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n27 The private land is being acquired through negotiated settlement between willing buyer and willing seller, such that \nthere is no expropriation required. The negotiation is being done through meaningful consultation with affected \npersons and POWERGRID's committee dealing with the land purchase, and will aim to offer a fair price. \nPOWERGRID will ensure any negotiations with affected persons are transparent, and an appropriate expert will \nvalidate the transaction. POWERGRID will document the processes of negotiation, such as the consultation \nprocesses, policies, and laws applicable to such transactions and third-party validation, and will submit to ADB after \nthe completion of negotiations and payment. \n28 Compensation Plan for Temporary Damages Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n29 POWERGRID developed a comprehensive environmental and social management system in 1998 and revised it in \n2009.  This  integrated  guidance  and  best  practices  from  the  World  Bank  through  a  multistakeholder  and \nparticipatory consultation process. \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  9 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject completion  Completion delays largely result from issues related to land acquisition and right-of-way \ndelayed  approvals. Land for the project has been identified, and the risk of delays is expected to be \nlow. POWERGRID has a strong in-house technical, legal, and management team that \nmonitors implementation, and their project implementation has historically been good. In the \ncase of delays and ensuing cost overruns, tariff regulations allow the regulator to approve an \nincrease in cost, based on which the transmission tariff is calculated, such that POWERGRID \ncan recover cost increases outside its control through the standard tariff methodology. \nLower revenue   Due to its business profile, regulated nature of capital expenditure, predictable tariff-based \n  revenues, and full cost recovery from a supportive regulatory environment, POWERGRID \nrevenue risk is considered to be low. The essential nature of power transmission has resulted \nin a good collection record with customers and low overdue receivables. Tariff regulations \nallow cost recovery of regulator-approved cost overruns.  \nRegulatory  The regulator has historically avoided making sudden or significantly adverse regulatory \nchanges  changes. Major regulatory decisions have been made on the basis of objective criteria and \ninput from stakeholders via a public and transparent process. The regulator provides detailed \nexplanation in support of new or amended regulations. The tariff structure and components \nhave remained largely unchanged in past regulatory periods. \nForeign exchange  A majority of POWERGRID\u2019s long-term debt is denominated in Indian rupees, and there is no \nvariations  foreign exchange risk with this. For foreign currency debt, POWERGRID has not undertaken \nany foreign exchange hedging, since foreign exchange-related costs or losses are permitted \nas a pass-through in the POWERGRID tariff, without further regulatory approval. \nPOWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n26.  The  government  and  POWERGRID  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n27.  The government and POWERGRID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and guarantee agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n28.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$500,000,000 to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, to be guaranteed by India, for the \nGreen Energy Corridor and Grid Strengthening Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nguarantee agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n10 November 2015 \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nIncreased overall efficiency of the Indian power system, expanded access to electricity, increased private \ninvestment in renewable energy, and enhanced energy security in India.
