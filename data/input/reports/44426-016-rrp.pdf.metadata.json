About  300  million  citizens  have  no  access  to  electricity, \nwhile  some  areas  face  daily  power  outages  due  to  a  lack  of  supply  and  transmission \nbottlenecks.3 The  government  is  scaling  up  investments  in  the  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution subsectors to address these issues. India is also promoting increased use of clean \nrenewable  energy,  universal  electricity  access,  and  energy  self-sufficiency  by  supplementing \nconventional power-generation sources (oil, gas, and coal). This includes ambitious renewable \nenergy  targets  in  the  electricity-generation  mix.  As  of  31  July  2015,  India  had  an  installed \ngenerating  capacity  of  275.9  GW,  of  which  36.5  GW  was  renewable  energy.4 In  2015,  the \nMinistry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy  (MNRE)  announced  state-level  renewable  energy-\ncapacity targets for 2022 with a national aggregate of 175 GW, with about 90% from solar and \nwind sources.5 \n \nGreen  Energy  Corridor  initiative.  In  2012,  MNRE  and  the  Forum  of  Regulators 6 \n4. \ncommissioned  POWERGRID  to  conduct  a  green  energy  corridor  study  to  identify  nationwide \ntransmission investments required to accommodate the additional renewable energy-generation \ncapacity. 7  Almost  60%  of  this  renewable  energy  capacity  is  located  in  six  states\u2014Andhra \nPradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. To facilitate the transfer \nof power from these renewable energy-rich states to others, as well as the absorption of power \nand addressing renewable energy intermittency and timing differences, POWERGRID identified \n$7 billion in investments to be undertaken in phases, starting under the Twelfth Five Year Plan. \nThese  include  (i)  intrastate  transmission  investments  of  about  $3.6  billion  within  renewable \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2013.

India\u2019s national transmission grid is divided into \nfive  regions. 8  Synchronous  interconnectivity  previously  existed  only  between  the  northern, \neastern,  western,  and  northeastern \nregions.  On  31  December  2013,  POWERGRID \ncommissioned  an  interconnection  between  the  southern  and  western  regions  that  enabled \nsynchronous  operation  of  an  interconnected  national  power  grid. This  not  only  augmented the \ninterregional  power  transfer  capacity  of  southern  states,  but  also  relieved  congestion  in  some \ntransmission corridors. Southern states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, \nhave been particularly troubled by power shortages. A more resilient regional and interregional \ngrid  is  essential  in  facilitating  power  transfers  among  states  and  regions.  Furthermore,  daily \npeak power demand does not occur simultaneously in all regions. One state or region may have \na  power  surplus  while  another  faces  a  deficit.  Hence,  an  integrated  national  grid  facilitates           \n(i) power transfers from areas with a surplus to those with a deficit, (ii) optimization of the power \nsystem by integrating the electricity market and encouraging power trading, and (iii) competitive \nelectricity  prices  and  improved  power  supply  mix  through  greater  use  of  renewable  energy. \nInterregional power transfer capacity as of 31 December 2014 was 46.5 GW and is envisaged \nto increase to 72.3 GW by 2017.9  \n \nBorrower.  POWERGRID,  India\u2019s  national  power  transmission  company,  is  responsible \n6. \nfor  planning,  developing,  and  operating  the  high-voltage  interstate  and  interregional  power \ntransmission  network. 10  POWERGRID  operates  about  90%  of  the  country\u2019s  interstate  and \ninterregional \n(km)  of \ntransmission  lines  and  197  transmission  substations  with  a  transformation  capacity  of  about \n239,424 megavolt-amperes  as of 31 July 2015\u2014and provides nondiscriminatory open access \nto its transmission system for any licensed utility or generating company.11 POWERGRID has a \nsound  implementation  record  in  upgrading  and  strengthening  the  national  high-voltage \ntransmission network, with consistent good operational performance evidenced by transmission \nnetwork availability of above 99% for the past 5 years.  \n \n7. \nProject  design.  POWERGRID\u2019s  immediate  investment  plans  consist  of  the  Green \nEnergy  Corridor  initiative\u2019s  interstate  portions,  including  a  high-capacity  transmission  corridor \nconnecting  major  renewable  energy  pockets  from  Gujarat  in  the  western  region  through \nRajasthan  to  Punjab  state  in  the  northern  region.  This  project  will  fund  a  portion  of  these \ninterstate investments, consisting of two 765 kV alternating current transmission lines, one 400 \nkV  alternating  current  transmission  line,  and  one  765/400  kV  substation  in  Rajasthan  state \nconnecting  to  a  765/400  kV  substation  in  Punjab  state,  including  a  real-time  system  for \nmeasuring  and  monitoring  power  flows.  Other  portions  of  the  initiative  are  funded  by  the \nGerman development cooperation through KfW for \u20ac500 million (about $556 million equivalent) \nthat  will  be  recognized  through  a  memorandum  of  understanding  as  parallel  collaborative \ncofinancing. 12 A  separate  project  component  will  further  increase  interregional  transmission \ncapacity  between the  western and the  southern  regional  grids  as part  of  a high-priority  HVDC \n\ntransmission  networks\u2014consisting  of  117,679  circuit  kilometers \n\n                                                \n8  The five regions are the northern, eastern, southern, western, and northeastern regions. \n9  Government \n\nof  Power.

The envisaged southern region generation-\ncapacity additions are not sufficient, and increased transmission capacity is therefore required. \nThis component consists of two 800 kV HVDC terminals\u2014one in Chhattisgarh (western region) \nand  the  other  in  Tamil  Nadu  (southern  region)\u2014and  two  320  kV  HVDC  terminals  connecting \nKerala and Tamil Nadu. This will expand western\u2013southern interconnectivity from 10 GW to 16 \nGW between Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu, and the portion between Tamil Nadu and Kerala will \nhave 2 GW capacity. The adoption of HVDC transmission technology improves power transfer \nefficiency  and reduces  transmission  losses  over  long  distances.  It  is  thus  a least-cost  solution \nand low-carbon investment option well suited for high-capacity interregional power transfers.  \n \n8. \nAlignment with ADB strategy and operations.  Supporting the Green Energy Corridor \ninitiative  and  financing  transmission  networks  to  increase  interregional  power  flows  are \nconsistent  with  the  Strategy  2020  and  Energy  Policy,  2009  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  that  advocates  the  promotion  of  renewable  energy,  increased  energy  efficiency, \nimproved energy security, and facilitation of the country\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy.13 \nIt  is  also  consistent  with  the  India  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  that  supports  (i) \nclean  and  renewable  energy  expansion;  (ii)  enhanced  energy  efficiency;  (iii)  promotion  of \nadvanced high-voltage transmission technology, including HVDC transmission lines to increase \ntransmission efficiency; and (iv) grid integration of renewable energy.14  \n \n9. \nSince  1995,  ADB  has  provided  POWERGRID  seven  sovereign-guaranteed  loans  and \none  nonsovereign  loan  to  strengthen  its  transmission  system  nationally.  The  projects  have  a \ngood implementation history and high ratings. Among these, ADB provided two loan facilities in \n2011 consisting of a nonsovereign loan and a sovereign-guaranteed loan in a single financing \npackage. 15  The  nonsovereign  loan  represented  POWERGRID\u2019s  first  transaction  without \nsovereign support, and helped POWERGRID diversify its financing sources.  \n \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  Renewable  energy-based  power  generation  is  still \n10. \nmore expensive than conventional coal-fired power generation in India and poses an additional \ncost burden due to its power intermittency. The government\u2019s intervention through the Electricity \nAct,  2003,  the  National  Action  Plan  on  Climate  Change,  and  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National \nSolar  Mission  has  created  the  necessary  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  incentives  to \nattract  private  sector  investments  into the  sector,  thereby  capturing  the  environmental  benefits \nof  renewable  energy  projects.  However,  the  public  sector  is  responsible  for  ensuring  timely \ninvestments  in  transmission  networks  to  allow  for  increased  renewable  energy  penetration.  In \nthis  context,  POWERGRID\u2019s  near-term  funding  needs  for  the  interstate  green  energy  corridor \nexceed $3.4 billion, whereas for enhanced overall interregional connectivity\u2014critical not just for \nrenewable energy but for bulk power evacuation and power system optimization\u2014it requires a \nfurther $10 billion.16 The previous ADB sovereign and nonsovereign loans helped POWERGRID \ndiversify  its  funding  sources.  POWERGRID  will  continue  to  access  all  available  sources, \nincluding  domestic  and  international  banks,  capital  markets,  and  multilateral  and  other \ndevelopment  financial  institutions,  including  ADB  to  fund  its  capital  investment  plans.  To \nmaintain affordability, POWERGRID must more closely match its funding sources\u2019 tenors to the \n\n                                                \n13 ADB.  2008.

ADB\u2019s assistance thus plays an important role \nin  financing  India\u2019s  power  transmission  components  that  are  critical  in  achieving  the \ninterregional \ntargets,  as  well  as \ngovernment\u2019s \ninterconnection  capacity.  Without  this,  (i)  significant  additional  generation  capacity  cannot  be \ntransferred, (ii) renewable and conventional energy project bankability becomes a challenge, (iii) \npower  trading  will  not  expand,  and  (iv)  continued  increases  in  access  to  affordable  power  will \nnot materialize. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nincreasing  overall \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  increased  overall  efficiency  of  the  Indian  power  system,  expanded \naccess to  electricity,  increased  private  investment  in renewable energy,  and  enhanced  energy \nsecurity in India. The outcome will be improved and more reliable transmission system capacity \nin the northern, western, and southern regions of India. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThese will be achieved by 2020 through the following outputs: (i) green energy corridor \ntransmission  system  expanded  in  the  northern  region  and  (ii)  transmission  interconnection \ncapacity between the western and southern regions expanded.

The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  equipment  procurement  and  installation.  ADB  finances \neligible  expenditures  up  to  100%  of  every  claim  it  receives,  as  long  as  sufficient  undisbursed \nloan amounts remain. If the remaining amount is not sufficient to cover 100% of the claim, only \nthe  remaining  amount  will  be  disbursed.  The  project  team  identified  risks  associated  with  the \nfinancing plan, and control mechanisms to address them (footnote 18). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nPOWERGRID has in-house planning capabilities, including computer-aided facilities for \n17. \ntransmission  system  planning,  design,  operation,  and  maintenance.  POWERGRID\u2019s  green \nenergy  corridor  study  (footnote  7)  identified  the  required  investments  and  estimated  capital \nexpenditure to ensure adequate capacity and system reliability to meet India\u2019s demand growth. \nThe  MNRE,  the  Forum of  Regulators,  and  the Central  Electricity  Authority  reviewed  data from \nstate  transmission  utilities  and  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission.  The  study  also \nincluded  power  demand  projections  taken  from  the  18th  Electric  Power  Survey  (2013)  of  the \nCentral Electricity Authority.  \n \n18. \nThe  800  kV  HVDC  transmission  system  is  state-of-the-art,  commercially  proven \ntechnology, and is the most cost-effective means of transmitting bulk power over long distances. \nFor  high-capacity,  point-to-point  transmission,  HVDC  is  economically  preferable  for  system \nlengths  exceeding  700\u2013800  km.  The  project  will  enhance  energy  efficiency  by  reducing \n\n                                                \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n7 \n \n\ntransmission  losses  to  about  3%  below  levels  of  typical  conventional  alternating  current \ntransmission systems. Screening for climate risks was conducted, and risks were assessed as \nlow. Such risks are considered in the project design.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nThe project\u2019s financial internal rate of return, calculated on a real basis, is 5.76%\u2014higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital of 3.66%\u2014and remains such in the various adverse \nsensitivity  scenarios.19 Its  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  to  be  16.60%.20 The \nproject is thus financially viable and economically sustainable. \n \n20. \nThe  government  has  awarded  POWERGRID  \u201cNavratna\u201d  status,  which  gives  public \nsector  undertakings  a  degree  of  managerial  and  financial  autonomy  despite  their  majority-\ngovernment ownership.21 POWERGRID maintains an international long-term issue credit rating \nof  BBB\u2013  (Outlook:  Stable)  from  both  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  and  Fitch,  and  enjoys  the  highest \ndomestic  credit  rating  of  AAA. 22 Based  on  the  cost-plus  nature  of  the  tariff-setting  process \ncoupled  with  its  operating  efficiency,  POWERGRID  has  increased  revenues  and  net  profits \nconsistently,  maintaining  a  robust  financial  position  with  stable  cash  flows  to  cover  its  costs, \ncapital investment, and debt payments. Over the last three years, it achieved a post-tax return \non net worth of over 10.0% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 times. In FY2015, \nthe  return  on  net  worth  rose  to  13.1%23 and  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio  improved  to  2.0 \ntimes.24 POWERGRID\u2019s  debt\u2013to\u2013equity  ratio  has  remained  at  approximately  70:30.  Although \nPOWERGRID  has  an  aggressive  investment  plan  and  a  large  need  for  additional  borrowings, \nfinancial projections show it has a sound financial position even under stress scenarios. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nAs  a  publicly  listed  company,  POWERGRID  is  subject  to  several  strong  governance \nmeasures  imposed  by  India\u2019s  Securities  and  Exchange  Board,  which  enhance  accountability, \ntransparency,  and  predictability  of  its  financial  governance  through  information  disclosure  to \nshareholders, investment professionals, and the general public. POWERGRID has an advanced \naccounting system using computerization with confidentiality and integrity at various levels. The \nfinancial management risk is thus low.  \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  POWERGRID.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe power sector is a key driver of India\u2019s economic growth and development. Access to \nindustrial,  and \n\n23. \nreliable,  stable,  and  adequate  electricity  supply \n                                                \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The nominal financial internal rate \n\nincreases  agricultural, \n\nof return is 10.72%, higher than the nominal weighted average cost of capital of 7.78%. \n\n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Navratna-status public sector undertakings may invest up to less than (i) Rs10 billion or (ii) 15% of net worth on a \n\nsingle project or 30% of net worth in a single year, without having to seek the government\u2019s permission. \n\n22 Since  2001,  POWERGRID\u2019s  domestic  bonds  have  been  rated  AAA  by  the  Credit  Rating  Information  Services  of \nIndia Limited and AAA by the Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited. Since 2008, the \nCredit Analysis and Research has also given these bonds an AAA rating. \n\n23 POWERGRID. 2015. FY2014\u20132015 Press and Analysts Meet Announcement. Mumbai. \n24 POWERGRID. 2015.

Economic  growth  helps  reduce \npoverty and improve quality of life, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of society.  The \nproject  will  avoid  or  minimize  negative  impacts  on  affected  people.25 Social  design  features \ninclude (i) compensation for loss of crops and trees at market value, (ii) additional assistance for \naffected  vulnerable  households,  and  (iii)  equal  opportunities  to  access  employment  and  equal \npay for men and women under civil works contracts. \n \nE. \n \n24. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous people. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), the project\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts and risks have been \nidentified. Measures to avoid, mitigate, and compensate for adverse environmental impacts are \nincorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination,  which  includes  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.26 Environmental  impacts  of  transmission  lines  can  be  minimized  by  careful \nroute  selection.  One  of  the  lines  passes  through  about  0.7  km  of  degraded  forest  land. \nCompensatory  afforestation  required  by  the  government  to  offset  this  impact  is  budgeted. \nPrivate  land  will  be  required  for  the  HVDC  terminal  in  Pugalur,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  is  being \nacquired  on  a  willing-buyer,  willing-seller  basis  and  through  negotiated  settlement. 27  The \nremaining substations are on government or POWERGRID-owned land, for which due diligence \nhas confirmed there are no encroachers or informal settlers and that the land is  free of claims \nand  disputes.  For  the  transmission  towers  and  lines,  impacts  are  temporary  and  will  occur \nduring construction in loss of crops and trees, which will be compensated. Measures to avoid, \nmitigate,  and  compensate  for  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  a  compensation  plan  for \ntemporary damages, analogous to ADB\u2019s resettlement plan.28 This contains basic elements of a \nresettlement  plan,  as  required  by  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  category  B  projects, \nand  is  based  on  the  principles  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement;  the  Indian  Telegraph  Act, \n1885;  and  the  Electricity  Act,  2003.  POWERGRID  has  the  commitment  and  ability  to  manage \nthe  social  and  environmental  risks.29\n Information  disclosure  to  and  consultations  with  affected \npeople will be conducted following ADB requirements. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures   \n\nF. \n \n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are  shown in Table 4 and further described in the \nrisk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 30  The  risks  are  manageable,  and  appropriate \nmitigation measures are incorporated. Integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n27 The private land is being acquired through negotiated settlement between willing buyer and willing seller, such that \nthere  is  no  expropriation  required.  The  negotiation  is  being  done  through  meaningful  consultation  with  affected \npersons  and  POWERGRID's  committee  dealing  with  the  land  purchase,  and  will  aim  to  offer  a  fair  price. \nPOWERGRID  will  ensure  any  negotiations  with  affected  persons  are  transparent,  and  an  appropriate  expert  will \nvalidate  the  transaction.  POWERGRID  will  document  the  processes  of  negotiation,  such  as  the  consultation \nprocesses, policies, and laws applicable to such transactions and third-party validation, and will submit to ADB after \nthe completion of negotiations and payment. \n\n28 Compensation Plan for Temporary Damages Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n29 POWERGRID developed a comprehensive environmental and social management system in 1998 and revised it in \n2009.  This  integrated  guidance  and  best  practices  from  the  World  Bank  through  a  multistakeholder  and \nparticipatory consultation process. \n\n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n9 \n \n\nRisks \nProject completion \ndelayed \n\nLower revenue  \n \n\nRegulatory \nchanges \n\nForeign exchange \nvariations \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nCompletion delays largely result from issues related to land acquisition and right -of-way \napprovals. Land for the project has been identified, and the risk of delays is expected to be \nlow. POWERGRID has a strong in-house technical, legal, and management team that \nmonitors implementation, and their project implementation has historically been good. In the \ncase of delays and ensuing cost overruns, tariff regulations allow the regulator to approve an \nincrease in cost, based on which the transmission tariff is calculated, such that POWERGRID \ncan recover cost increases outside its control through the standard tariff methodology. \nDue to its business profile, regulated nature of capital expenditure, predictable tariff-based \nrevenues, and full cost recovery from a supportive regulatory environment, POWERGRID \nrevenue risk is considered to be low. The essential nature of power transmission has resulted \nin a good collection record with customers and low overdue receivables. Tariff regulations \nallow cost recovery of regulator-approved cost overruns.  \nThe regulator has historically avoided making sudden or significantly adverse regulatory \nchanges. Major regulatory decisions have been made on the basis of objective criteria and \ninput from stakeholders via a public and transparent process. The regulator provides detailed \nexplanation in support of new or amended regulations. The tariff structure and components \nhave remained largely unchanged in past regulatory periods. \nA majority of POWERGRID\u2019s long-term debt is denominated in Indian rupees, and there is no \nforeign exchange risk with this. For foreign currency debt, POWERGRID has not undertaken \nany foreign exchange hedging, since foreign exchange-related costs or losses are permitted \nas a pass-through in the POWERGRID tariff, without further regulatory approval. \n\nPOWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n26. \nThe  government  and  POWERGRID  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n27. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and guarantee agreement. \n \n\nThe government and POWERGRID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n28. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$500,000,000 to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, to be guaranteed by India, for the \nGreen Energy Corridor and Grid Strengthening Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nguarantee agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n10 November 2015 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nIncreased  overall  efficiency  of  the  Indian  power  system,  expanded  access  to  electricity,  increased  private \ninvestment  in  renewable  energy,  and  enhanced  energy  security  in  India.
