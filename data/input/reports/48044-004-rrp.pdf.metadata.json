Inequality of income and \nopportunity  will  be  addressed  through  redistributive  fiscal  policy,  specifically  in  tax  and  social \nprotection measures.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Georgian  economy  grew  at  an  annual  average  of  5.8%  during  2004\u20132014.  The \ngrowth  reflected  reforms  to  liberalize  the  economy  and  remove  bureaucratic  barriers,  while \nstrengthening  transparency  and  accountability.  Consequently  governance  and  the  business \nenvironment  improved, although significant  barriers  remain  to business operations  and private \nsector competitiveness. The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report for 2014\u2013\n2015 ranks Georgia 69th out of 144 countries. Constraints to private sector development include \nan inadequately skilled workforce, limited access to finance, and gaps in infrastructure.3 \n \n4. \nEconomic  activity  in  the  region  has  been  decelerating  as  a  result  of  the  economic \nslowdown in the Russian Federation and a significant fall in oil prices. The economic contraction \nin the Russian Federation has also led to a sharp drop in remittances, erasing any gains from \nlower oil prices in Georgia, which is a net importer. Overall, the regional outlook has not been \nthis  weak  since  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2008\u20132009. 4 In  February  2015,  the  Georgian \ngovernment  cut gross  domestic product (GDP) growth projections  by  more  than  half,  to  2.0%. \nThe  fiscal  deficit  is  expected  to  rise  in  Georgia,  requiring  fiscal  consolidation  in  the  short  and \nmedium  term.  The  current  economic  environment  is  also  creating  pressure  on  the  country\u2019s \nfinancial  system.  Currency  depreciation  is  increasing  credit  and  solvency  risks,  and  slowing \neconomic  growth  is  heightening  credit  risk. 5  Continuing  structural  reforms  are  essential  to \nincrease  domestic \ninclusive  economic  growth,  while \nguaranteeing social assistance to the poor and vulnerable during the slowdown and thereafter.   \n\nresource  mobilization \n\nfor  more \n\n \n5. \nSocial  expenditures  and  fiscal  pressure.  Georgia\u2019s  generally  strong  growth \nperformance has not been matched by commensurate reductions in unemployment and poverty. \nDespite  a  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  from  16.9%  in  2009  to  12.4%  in  2014,  further \nreduction  is  needed.  The  percentage  of  the  population  living  below  the  national  poverty  line \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  proposed  program is  included  in  the country  operations  business plan,  2015\u20132017  for  Georgia.  ADB.  2014. \n\nCountry Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n\n3   World  Economic  Forum.  2014.  Global Competitiveness  Report  2014\u20132015.  Geneva.  According  to  the  report, \nGeorgia\u2019s  banking system  has  much  work  to  do in  improving  access to  credit  (ranked 110  among 144 countries \ncompared to Armenia at 97, Azerbaijan at 79, and Kazakhstan at 43) and affordability of financial services (ranked \n75 with Armenia at 81, Azerbaijan at 77, and Kazakhstan at 55). \n\n4   International  Monetary  Fund.  2015.  Regional  Economic  Outlook  Update  for  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia. \n\nWashington, DC. \n\n5   Since November 2014, the Georgian lari has depreciated by about 31% against the dollar. \n\n\fDevelopment and implementation of a multi-pillar pension system will help achieve key \n\n(60% of median consumption) was 21.4% in 2014, down from 24.6% in 2004. Beginning in 2012 \nthe  government  has  worked  to  pair  better  economic  performance  with  improved  social \noutcomes. Social spending\u2013\u2013on health, education, and social assistance\u2013\u2013increased to 11.7% \nof  GDP  in  2014  from  11.2%  in  2013,  an  increase  of  nearly  31%  over  2012  budgeted \nexpenditure. Growth in social expenditure is pressuring public finance. Pensions are the largest \nsocial  spending  item  in the  state  budget;  in 2014  it  represented  55%  of  all  social  benefits  and \nabout  19.9%  of  public  expenditure  (4.5%  of  GDP).  These  costs  are  expected  to  continue  to \nincrease due to the growing number of pensioners and the rising cost of pension benefits. \n \n6. \nDomestic  savings  and  access  to  finance.  The  fully  government-financed  universal \npension system (pillar zero) is the largest component of the current pension system in Georgia, \naccounting  for  almost  84%  of  total  pension  expenditure. 6 The  system  entitles  all  citizens  to \nreceive pension benefits (at 60 years of age for women and 65 for men), making it an important \ninstrument  of  poverty  reduction  and  income  security  for  the  elderly.  The  flat  rate  pension  has \nmore than doubled over the last 5 years, but is still only marginally above the subsistence level. \nIn the absence of additional opportunities to save, public pressure to raise the universal pension \nrate will increase the government\u2019s financial burden and challenge long-term fiscal sustainability.  \n \n7. \nfiscal  and  social  objectives.  Incorporating  contributory  elements  in  the  pension  system  will         \n(i)  increase  old-age  income  from  sources  outside  of  the  state  budget; 7  and  (ii)  reduce \nexpectations  placed  on  the  pillar  zero  system  and  (once  the  new  pension  system  matures) \nspread the burden of financing future pensions more fairly across stakeholders and generations. \nThere is limited domestic funding capacity in Georgia, with a long-term investment horizon that \nrestrains  economic  growth,  creating  an  over-reliance  on  foreign  inflows.  Pension  fund  assets \nhave  long-term  investment  objectives,  with  a  primary  focus  of  maintaining  real  asset  values. \nThis can stabilize bond markets and security exchanges, and help finance infrastructure needs. \nA  defined  contributory  pension  system  is  expected  to  improve  the  overall  savings  rate  in  the \ncountry. \n \n8. \nPublic  debt  and  capital  markets.  Georgia\u2019s  public  debt  to  GDP  ratio  was  35.5%  in \n2014,  75%  of  which  is  denominated  in  foreign  currency  (largely  in  dollars).  This  exposes \nGeorgia to foreign exchange risk, creating a source of vulnerability. Additionally the multilateral \nconcessional  windows  are  closing,  raising  the  average  external  borrowing  rate.  A  challenging \ntransition from external sources of finance to local currency-denominated government securities \nwill  be  needed  over  the  medium  term.  The  shift  is  needed  not  only  to  manage  the  country\u2019s \nforeign  exchange  exposure,  but  to  support  the  development  of  the  Georgian  bond  and  capital \nmarkets and to sustain public investment plans. Development of the domestic government yield \ncurve is essential for market infrastructure and information, as it sets the pricing and evaluation \nof domestic credit options for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and capital markets.  \n\n \n9. \nThe  SME  sector  represents  nearly  95%  of  registered  businesses  and employs  37%  of \nthe workforce in Georgia, but accounted for only 16.9% of business turnover in 2014. Firms cite \n\n                                                \n6   Pillar zero is the existing state-run universal pension plan, which offers basic coverage and is primarily focused on \n\nreducing poverty.  \n\n7   Contributory elements include a mandatory funded system that recipients and employers pay into (pillar II) through \npension funds and defined contribution savings plans, and possibly voluntary privately funded accounts (pillar III) \nthrough individual savings plans and insurance. The design details of the proposed pension system are included in \nSector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\flimited  access  to  bank  credit,  high  interest  rates,  and  expensive  financial  services  as  major \nconstraints to growth.  Underdeveloped  securities and capital markets  as  well  as reliance on  a \nfully publicly funded pension scheme prevent higher savings rates and limit the funds available \nfor lending. Increased access to finance, especially for small businesses managed by women, is \nimportant for diversification of the economy.   \n \n10. \nPrivate  finance  and  fiscal  risks.  The  government  wishes  to  mobilize  private \ninfrastructure investment, highlighting the need to manage fiscal risks. The policy to implement \npublic projects with private sector participation needs to be set up for consistent implementation, \nbecause  many  projects  with  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  characteristics  are  being \ndeveloped.  Existing  contracts  for  PPP-type  projects,  as  well  as  projects  currently  under \ndevelopment, contain contingent liabilities for the government. The lack of a framework for fiscal \nrisk means that the contingent liabilities of existing and future PPP contracts are not transparent \nand  are  not  well  understood  or  managed  by  the  government.  This  exposes  ministries,  state-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  local  governments  to  the  risk  of  entering  into  new  contracts \nwithout an accurate assessment of the affordability or fiscal risk. It also makes the market less \ntransparent for the private sector.  \n \n11. \nGovernment  efforts  and  development  coordination. The government has initiated a \npension  reform  program  to  address  adequacy,  fairness,  and  sustainability.  A  Pension  Reform \nUnit  was  established  and  staffed  in  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Sustainable  Development \n(MOESD)  in  2014  to  design  a  new  defined  contributory  pension  system.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  instrumental  in facilitating  these  reforms  and  in  designing \nthe mandatory and voluntary contributory pension schemes. The government is developing the \ndomestic debt market, seeking increased market participation. ADB is working closely with the \ngovernment  to  update  the  regulatory  environment,  to  ensure  issuer  and  trading  price \ntransparency and deepen investor protection. The government has undertaken several activities \nto  address  fiscal  risk  management  for  projects  with  private  involvement,  and  is  increasing  the \navailability of finance to SMEs.  \n \n12.  Many  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies  are  supporting  the  country\u2019s \neconomic  development.  The  World  Bank  is  working  to  strengthen  fiscal  oversight  of  public \ninstitutions,  upgrade  the  quality  and  coverage  of  social  services,  and  support  financial  sector \ndeepening through policy lending during 2015\u20132017. In 2014 the European Parliament ratified \nthe European Union\u2019s Association Agreement with Georgia, including an agreement on a deep \nand  comprehensive  free  trade  area  spanning  2014\u20132017,  which  together  with  political \nassociation  and  market  opening  aims  for  approximation  of  Georgian  systems  and  norms  with \nthose of the European Union. In 2014, Georgia entered into a 3-year standby arrangement with \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  that  provides  a  cushion  against  external  balance  of  payment \nshocks, and sets a framework for discipline in macro-fiscal policies.  \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  value  additions  and  lessons.  The  program  supports  inclusive  growth  by \ngenerating long-term savings and making short-term capital available for small businesses and \ninfrastructure.  The  programmatic  approach  adopted  for  the  program--  sequencing  of  reforms \nwith the flexibility to incrementally change the reforms based on the progress achieved-- allows \nthe  government  to  build  on  achievements  and  lessons from  the  reforms  and to  steer  the  next \nphase of policy reforms accordingly.8 It allows the government to take on complex reforms in a \n\n                                                \n8   ADB.  2014.

For  example,  the  government \nembarked on reforms to better manage fiscal risks and contingent liabilities, and to contain the \nburgeoning fiscal costs of the universal pension system. Relevant lessons on the need for policy \nreforms,  a  stronger  focus  on  inclusive  growth,  and  longer-term  engagement  in  public  sector \nreforms  have  been  incorporated  from  the  evaluation  findings  of  Georgia\u2019s  country  program \nportfolio,  and  continue  to  be  applied  throughout  the  program  cluster.9 Relevant  lessons  from \nsubprogram 1 include the need for longer-term engagement with the government in key policy \nareas \nthe \nmacroeconomic  framework.  ADB  is  providing  ongoing  TA,  and  plans  to  continue  working  on \nmacroeconomic and public sector issues. \n \n14. \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy  of \nGeorgia  (Georgia  2020)  establishes  policy  directions  for  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth. 10 The  proposed  program  corresponds  closely  to  the  core  areas  of  fiscal  efficiency, \npublic  debt management,  domestic  savings,  access to finance for  SMEs,  and capital  markets. \nThe  program  also  responds  to  the  2014\u20132016  National  Action  Plan  for  Implementation  of \nGender Equality Policy in Georgia, which includes support for gender equality in economic and \nfinance sectors.11 The program is consistent with the ADB country partnership strategy, 2014\u2013\n2018  for  Georgia  and  the  findings  from  the  ADB  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020. 12 The \ncountry  partnership  strategy  aims  to  foster  inclusive  economic  growth  through  measures  to \nenhance  private  sector  competitiveness,  improve  public  sector  management,  and  increase \nsavings and domestic resource mobilization for investment. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe  program  impact  will  be  that  citizens,  particularly  women,  benefit  from  higher  living \nstandards and more employment opportunities. The outcome will be the effective mobilization of \ndomestic resources for increased public and private investment.  \n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe program comprises three annual subprograms to support the government\u2019s reform \ninitiatives. It specifically covers medium-term issues in four areas: (i) improving management of \ndebt,  cash,  and  fiscal  risk;  (ii)  strengthening  revenue  and  public  expenditure  management;        \n(iii)  enhancing  generation  of  domestic  savings;  and  (iv)  increasing  mobilization  of  private \nresources  for  investment.  Subprogram  2  has  27  policy  actions,  with  two  additional  actions \ncompleted that facilitate access to finance for small businesses. Some targets were exceeded: \nthe  actual  number  of  female  auditors  was  147  (versus  a  target  of  110),  and \nthe \nEntrepreneurship Development Agency (EDA) budget allocation stood at GEL21 million (versus \na target of GEL20 million). The policy action on submission of a capital market strategy to the \ncabinet  was  modified,  with  review  and  approval  by  the  Economic  Council  prior  to  cabinet \ndeliberations. This ensures that the views of all stakeholders are considered through intensive \npublic\u2013private dialogue sessions. There are 25 indicative policy actions for subprogram 3. \n \nOutput 1: Improved management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk. The objective of this \n17. \noutput  is  to  improve  fiscal  consolidation  through  strengthened  debt,  cash,  and  fiscal  risk \n                                                \n9  ADB.

Subprogram  1  improved  debt  management  capacity  by  strengthening  relevant \ngovernment  processes,  increasing  transparency  and  developing  analytical  and  forecasting \ncapabilities,  and  facilitating  introduction  of  the  medium-term  debt  strategy.  Subprogram  1  also \nstrengthened fiscal risk management by drafting a strategy to deal with different types of fiscal \nrisks  and  by  determining  the  fiscal  position  of  large  SOEs,  to  enable  adoption  of  systematic \nprocedures and resources to better manage fiscal risks and assess contingent liabilities.  \n \n18. \nSubprogram 2 (i) prepared a medium-term debt management strategy covering the loan \nportfolio and goals and principles to apply when incurring new debt; (ii) prepared an action plan \nto  strengthen  the  middle  office  (analytical)  function  of  the  Public  Debt  and  External  Financing \nDepartment in evaluating and advising on the public debt portfolio; (iii) developed a systematic \nprocess  for  debt  and  loan  guarantee  recordkeeping,  reporting,  and  validation;  (iv)  set  up  a \ndedicated  analytical \n(v)  established  a  dedicated  staffed  and  budgeted  function  to  manage  fiscal  risks,  including \ncontingent  liabilities  of  SOEs  and  PPP  projects;  (vi)  established  procedures,  assigned \ninstitutional  responsibilities,  and set  aside  adequate  human  and financial  resources  to monitor \nand help manage different types of fiscal risk; and (vii) carried out the first complete assessment \nof  (a) macro  risk,  (b)  external  debt  sustainability,  and  (c)  risk  associated with loan guarantees \nand other similar contingent liabilities. \n \nSubprogram 3 will build on the accomplishments of subprograms 1 and 2 by continuing \n19. \nto improve the management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk over the medium term. The legislative \namendments  required  to  implement  the  newly  prepared  debt  strategy  will  be  debated  in \nParliament.  Debt  management  and  risk  analysis  systems  will  be  upgraded.  A  systematic \nprocess  will  be  developed  to  track  debt  and  loan  guarantees  and  report  the  government\u2019s \nfinancial statements in a timely manner. Information on contingent liabilities related to SOEs and \nPPPs will be provided.  \n \nOutput  2:  Strengthened  revenue  and  public  expenditure  management.  The \n20. \nobjective  of  this  output  is  to  increase  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  revenue  collection, \nimprove  public  expenditure  management,  and  strengthen \ntransfers. \nSubprogram  1  established  a  new  administrative  department  under  the  Georgia  Revenue \nService,  enabling  recovery  of  tax  arrears  and  increasing  revenue  collection.  Subprogram  1 \ndevised an action plan to replace external auditors with in-house tax auditors, and provided the \nrequisite  training.  Budgeting  and  budget  execution  functions  of  government  entities  were  also \nintegrated into the public financial management system and the treasury single account.  \n \n21. \nSubprogram 2 (i) recovered arrears from active taxpayers  of GEL80 million in 2015 (to \ndate);  (ii)  reduced the  statutory  time  limitation  of  tax  notices  and taxpayer  notices from  6 to  5 \nyears,  shortening  the  tax  liability  imposition  period  and  providing  relief  to  taxpayers;                \n(iii) increased the number of in-house tax auditors to 286 (versus a target of 275), of which 147 \nare women (significantly exceeding the target of 110); (iv) moved cash operations of local self-\ngovernments and legal entities of public law to the treasury single account, with budgeting and \naccounting  processes  handled  through  the  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system; 13                \n(v) MOESD identified gaps in the legal and regulatory framework for preparation, appraisal, and \nimplementation of PPP projects; and (vi) the government submitted to Parliament proposals for \namendments  to  the  Budgetary  Code  defining  the  separation  of  revenues  among  the  state, \nautonomous region, and municipality budgets. \n\nlocal  government \n\n                                                \n13 There  are  more  than  2,000  schools  and  kindergartens,  many  of  them  in  remote  and  rural  areas,  which  do  not \n\nstrictly come under the purview of legal entities of public law and are not covered. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fSubprogram  3  will  build  on  the  accomplishments  made  under  subprogram  1  and  2.  A \n22. \nreduction  in  tax  notice  time  limitations,  writing  off  of  tax  arrears  of  defunct  businesses  on  the \nbasis of legally approved categories, and increasing the number of in-house tax auditors to the \nfull  complement  will  streamline  tax  collection  efforts.  Drafting  of  regulations  to  support  the \npreparation,  appraisal,  and  implementation  of  PPP  projects  will  facilitate  participation  of  the \nprivate sector in infrastructure projects. \n \n23. \nOutput  3:  Enhanced generation  of  domestic savings. The objective of this output is \nto reform the existing pension system so that it helps prevent old-age poverty, is affordable for \nboth  individuals  and  society,  and  is  sustainable  in  the  long  term.  The  aim  is  to  streamline  the \nuniversal pension and create a supplementary private pension savings scheme. Subprogram 1 \nestablished a government pension reform unit, tasked with designing a pension system built on \na  legal  and  institutional  framework  covering  asset  security,  consumer  protection,  professional \nmanagement of investment funds, and a transparent reporting and information system. \n\n \n24. \nSubprogram  2  (i)  completed  the  forecast  of  the  present  and  future  cost  of  universal \npensions  under  various  scenarios,  using  the  Prost  Modeling  system  developed  by  the  World \nBank and other approaches; (ii) submitted to the government pension system revisions ensuring \ncontinuity  of  equitable  treatment  for  men  and  women;  (iii)  completed  analysis  of  key  areas  of \npension  system  design  and  structure,  incorporating  mandatory  and  voluntary  dimensions;              \n(iv)  issued  a  consensual  paper  on  the  nature  of  the  hybrid  pillar,  including  discussion  on \nmembership, contributions, tax considerations, benefits, gender, and relationships with the zero \npillar; (v) submitted to the cabinet for approval a strategy and time-bound action plan for pension \nreforms, including legal and regulatory gaps, data privacy, and tax legislation; (vi) developed an \napproach for public awareness programs for zero and hybrid pillars, outlining specific measures \nfor  continuing  equitable  treatment  of  men  and  women;  and  (vii)  completed  the  review  of  the \nexisting private pension structure to incorporate any required changes in the related legislation.  \n \nUnder subprogram 3 preparatory steps for implementation will take place, including the \n25. \ndevelopment  of  an  individual  account  system,  drafting  of  legislation  for  the  private  pension \nsavings scheme, and launching of a nationwide communication campaign. \n \nOutput 4: Increased mobilization of private resources for investment. The objective \n26. \nof  this  output  is  to  mobilize  long-term  finance  and  enhance  access  to  finance  through  small \nbusiness  financing,  development,  and  gender  targeting.  Subprogram  1  established  an \ninteragency  working  group  to  initiate  capital  market  development.  The  EDA  and  Georgia \nInnovation  and  Technology  Agency  (GITA)  were  also  created  to  provide  mini-  and  matching \ngrants to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.  \n \n27. \nSubprogram  2  (i)  issued  a  public  notification  on  the  concept  and  direction  of  capital \nmarket  reforms,  including  corporate  securities,  expansion  of  the  bond  market,  and  money \nmarket  instruments  for  secured  interbank  trading;  (ii)  submitted  to  the  Economic  Council  for \napproval, as a precursor to cabinet approval, a strategy and time-bound action plan for capital \nmarket reforms, that addresses legal and regulatory gaps and improvements to market structure \nand efficiency; (iii) allocated a budget of GEL21 million to EDA; (iv) allocated a budget of GEL6 \nmillion to GITA; (v) expanded, within the existing budget, EDA\u2019s matching grant facility for micro, \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  by GEL4  million,  with  30%  earmarked for  businesses  run \nby  women;  (vi)  expanded,  within  the  existing  budget,  GITA\u2019s  financial  instruments  to  support \nprivate sector innovation and technology development by GEL3 million, with 30% earmarked for \nbusinesses run by women; and (vii) implemented the gender action plan and publicly reported \non results included in the program policy areas, such as small business training and financing. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fAdditionally,  EDA  launched  a  new  program  \u201cProduce  in  Georgia\u201d  with  a  component  on  micro \nand  small  enterprise  development  in  rural  areas,  with  a  budget  of  GEL20  million  (for  2015\u2013\n2017).  GITA  created  Geolab\u2013\u2013a  mobile  training  and  knowledge  exchange  platform  and \nfabrication  laboratory\u2014for  research  and  development,  with  a  budget  of  GEL1.1  million.  In \naddition  three  innovation  labs  were  created  with  GITA  support,  and  construction  of  the  first \ntechno park in Georgia is ongoing. \n \n28. \nUnder  subprogram  3,  the implementation  of  capital  market  development plan  will  be  in \nan  advanced  stage,  including  review  of  laws  and  regulations  on  investment,  governance,  risk \nmanagement, and fund managers; approval of account and prudential regulations for repos and \nsecurities  lending;  and  expansion  of  the  matching  grant  facility  for  small  enterprises,  with \nspecific gender targets. \n\n \nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nD. \n \n29. \nThe  overall  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $200  million  equivalent  for  2014\u20132016. \nSubprogram 2 comprises single-tranche loans in the aggregate amount of $75 million equivalent. \nSubprogram  1,  with  a  loan  amount  of  $75  million  equivalent,  was  disbursed  in  2014. \nSubprogram  3,  with  a  loan  amount  of  $50  million  equivalent,  is  subject  to  further  discussion \nbetween  ADB  and  the  government. 14  To  help  finance  subprogram  2,  the  government  has \nrequested (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR37,966,000 ($53 million equivalent) \nfrom  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources,  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  \u20ac19,891,500  ($22  million  equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.15 The Asian Development Fund  loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe ordinary capital resources loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \nthe  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s European interbank offered rate (EURIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  year,  and such  other terms  and conditions  set forth  in the draft  loan agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years with no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n30. \nThe  loan  size  is  based  on  government\u2019s  development  financing  needs,  the  nature  and \nsequence  of  the  required  reforms,  and  potential  development  impact.  The  government\u2019s \ndevelopment-related  financing  gap  is  estimated  at  GEL1,625  million,  an  increase  of  2.7%  in \n2015 relative to 2014.16  The government intends to meet this gap by borrowing from domestic \n(30.8%) and foreign (69.2%) sources. Domestic borrowing comprises GEL400 million issues of \ntreasury  securities  (net),  with  an  additional  GEL100  million  issue  deposited  with  banks. While \nforeign  borrowing  comprises  financing  and  long-term  investment  credits  projected  at  GEL620 \nmillion, and anticipated budget support from the World Bank and other development partners of \nGEL505 million equivalent (equivalent of GEL172 million policy-based loan from ADB, GEL276 \nmillion  in  development  policy  operations  from  the  World  Bank,  and  GEL57  million  in \nmacroeconomic  support  from  the  European  Union).  ADB\u2019s  subprogram  2  will  help  narrow  the \ngovernment\u2019s  financing  gap  by  about  34.1%  in  2015  and  will  help  meet  part  of  the  financing \nneeds.  Public  debt  is  projected  to  climb  slightly  over  40.0%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  2015  as  a \nresult  of  government  borrowing  and  program-based  budget  support,  before  declining  in  the \n                                                \n14  The  significant  economic  slowdown  and  currency  depreciation  pose  serious  challenges  to  the  government\u2019s \nongoing reforms with respect to fiscal consolidation, increased domestic resource mobilization, improved financial \nsector  diversification,  and  guaranteed  social  protection.  To  cover  the  larger-than-expected  financing  gap,  the \ngovernment has requested that ADB increase the subprogram 2 amount from the original $50 million to $75 million. \n\n15 The development policy letter from the government is in Appendix 3. \n16 Government  of  Georgia,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2015.

Budget support is necessary to finance part of the development financing needs, \nparticularly for the period from the introduction of reforms to the realization of fiscal benefits.17 \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) is the executing agency and MOESD and MOF are the \nimplementing  agencies  for  the  program.  A  program  steering  committee  has  been  formed \ncomprising senior officials from the two ministries, chaired by the deputy minister of finance. The \ncommittee  meets  semiannually  to  review  progress  in  achieving  the  program\u2019s  agreed  policy \nactions. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed to Georgia in accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans.18 The loan proceeds will be used to finance the cost (excluding local taxes \nand  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  implementation \nperiod  for  the  overall  program  is  from  January  2014  to  December  2016,  while  the \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 is from November 2014 to September 2015. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  reforms  supported  by  the  program  entail  direct  and  indirect  fiscal  costs  to  the \n32. \ngovernment\u2014the cost of implementing and monitoring the reforms\u2014along with fiscal savings in \nthe  medium  to  long  term.  The  reforms  bear  both  the  direct  and  operating  costs  of  dedicated \npublic  functions  and  agencies  established  under  the  program. 19  Higher  expenditures  are \ntherefore  warranted  over  the  short  term  to  realize  these  savings,  necessitating  the  need  for \nbudget support. Over time, these reforms will generate a positive fiscal feedback by creating a \nwider and more diversified economic base and improved management of macroeconomic risks. \nThe reform program will result in cost savings and additional gains due to (i) declining pension \nfunding costs and a reduced burden on public finances from the introduction of a supplementary \npension  system;  (ii) financial  savings from more  efficient  and effective use of  public resources \nthrough  better  cash,  debt,  and fiscal  risk  management;  and  (iii)  financial  gains  from  additional \nrevenues due to increased mobilization of private capital for investment.  \n \n33. \nPension reforms alone will have major budgetary implications. Pension costs increased \nto GEL1.33 billion (4.5% of GDP) in 2014 and are projected to grow to GEL1.39 billion in 2015. \nGiven  regular  increases  in  the  universal  pension  rate  and  in  the  number  of  pensioners,  the \ngovernment  will  incur  GEL8  billion  in  pillar  zero  payments  for  2016\u20132020.20 The  government \ncontribution for the proposed pillar II supplementary pension is estimated  at GEL313 million in \nthe first 3 years and GEL631 million in the first 5 years of implementation.21 Development of the \nmedium-term debt strategy under the program aims to meet the government\u2019s public financing \nneeds and payment obligations while minimizing long-term costs, with debt ceilings set at 10.5% \n\n                                                \n17 Paras. 31\u201332 and the Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2) discuss and analyze the direct and indirect fiscal costs to the government of implementing and monitoring the \nreforms, and consequent adjustments to the ongoing policies and programs.  \n\n18 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n19 The costs incurred to public agencies are in terms of administrative and enforcement costs related to monitoring, \nimplementation  and  enforcement,  as  well  as  direct  fiscal  costs.  The  latter  include  the  expense  associated  with \nestablishing statutory agencies, budget increases, staff time, expenditure programs, and foregone revenue. \n\n20 Calculations are based on fiscal projections developed by National Bank of Georgia and MOESD; the World Bank \n\nprojects that pension spending under the current universal system will double to 9% of GDP by 2070. \n\n21 A detailed analysis and calculations are in the Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked of \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n\fGovernance  \n\nof budget revenues, 40% of GDP, and 30% of total borrowing. The reform will lead to additional \nbenefits and savings associated with fiscal discipline and with improvements in core budgetary \nand  fiscal  risk  responsibilities  as  a  result  of  increased  risk  management  capacity  within  MOF. \nAdditional  revenues  of  GEL80  million  have  been  realized  and  increased  intergovernmental \ntransfers of up to GEL40 million are expected through the program. Developing capital markets \nto  mobilize  long-term  finance  will  spur  growth  and  increase  the  efficiency  of  SMEs  through \ngreater  access  to  finance  and  better  gender  targeting.  Mobilizing  private  resources  for \ninvestment is important given the low national savings rate, which compounds the twin deficit of \nfiscal and external imbalances with a low reliance on internal sources of financing. \n \nB. \n \nPublic financial management risks are manageable for this program. Following the 2003 \n34. \nRose  Revolution,  far-reaching  structural  reforms  were  introduced,  strengthening  PFM  and \nreducing  corruption.  The  integrated  PFM  system  was  implemented  and  state  financial \ntransactions  unified  under  a  single  treasury  account.  However  challenges  remain,  including \ninadequate monitoring and analysis of government contingent liabilities, the failure to include the \nrevenues  and  expenditures  of  some  legal  entities  of  public  law  in  budget  execution  reports, \ninadequate predictability and transparency of intergovernmental transfers, limited internal audit \ncapacity, and weak legislative scrutiny of external audit reports.22 Fighting high-level corruption \nis  a  government  priority.  Aggressive  enforcement  of  anticorruption  policies  has  largely \neliminated petty corruption. The State Procurement Agency continues to improve transparency \nin public procurement processes by adopting international standards. A new electronic module \nwas recently integrated into the e-procurement system that provides a platform for meeting the \nprocurement requirements of multilateral development banks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MOF and MOESD.  \n \nC. \n \n35. \nThe  basic  pension  plays  an  important  role  in  poverty  reduction  and  serves  a  valuable \nwelfare  distribution  function.  Without  the  basic  pension,  poverty  would  increase  from  24%  to \n33%,  and  inequality  would  increase  the  Gini  coefficient  from  37.7  to  40.9.23 Subprogram  2  is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. It will address the unequal access to assets and \nresources,  and  the  insufficient  attention  paid  to  gender  in  economic  development  policy.  The \nGeorgia  Revenue  Service  is  hiring  an  equal  number  of  women  and  men  as  in-house  tax \nauditors. Pension reforms will ensure equitable treatment of men and women, allowing both to \naccumulate  sufficient  pension  assets  to  ensure  an  adequate  income  during  old  age  while \nmaintaining  prevention  of  old  age  poverty  through  the  universal  pension.  EDA  has  allocated \n30%  of  matching  grants  to  women  entrepreneurs  for  business  development.  GITA  has  funds \nearmarked  to  support  private  sector  innovation  and  technology  development,  with  30%  for \nwomen entrepreneurs. The government will continue implementing the gender action plan and \nsupporting increased participation of women in economic and business development.  \n \nD. \n \nProgram activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms.

Macroeconomic  management  is  generally  sound.  Because  of  its  solid \nfundamentals,  reform-minded  authorities,  and  improved  market  access  to  the  European \nUnion, 24  Georgia  is  well  placed  to  overcome  the  current  challenges.  Weak  monitoring  of \ncontingent  liabilities  and  limited  coverage  of  PFM  are  risks.  PFM-related  risks  are  being \naddressed with support provided under the program and by the TA.25 The integrated benefits of \nthe program are expected to outweigh the costs.26 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n38. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in  detail  in the loan \ndocuments. \n \n39. \nset forth in the loan agreements. \n \n\nThe government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 2, which are \n\n \n40. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR37,966,000  to  Georgia  for \nsubprogram  2  of  the  Improving  Domestic  Resource  Mobilization  for  Inclusive \nGrowth Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of \n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board; and  \nthe loan of \u20ac19,891,500 to Georgia for subprogram 2 of the Improving Domestic \nResource Mobilization for Inclusive Growth Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  European \ninterbank  offered rate (EURIBOR)-based  lending facility; for  a term  of  15  years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n \n\n26 August 2015 \n\n                                                \n24 On  27  June  2014,  Georgia  and  the  European  Union  signed  an  Association  Agreement,  including  a  deep  and \ncomprehensive  trade  area,  leading  to  increased  European  integration  and  providing  export  and  investment \nopportunities. \n\n25 ADB. 2014.
