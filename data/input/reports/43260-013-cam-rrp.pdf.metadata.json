It  supports \nstrengthening  of  the  basic  education  system  (grades  1\u20139),  in  particular  the  lower  secondary \nsubsector (grades 7\u20139), through (i) expanded access to lower secondary education, (ii) improved \nquality  of  lower  secondary  education,  and  (iii)  improved  subsector  management.  It  builds  on \nprevious  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  including  the  Second  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program 4 and the Enhancing Education Quality Project.5 The scope is nationwide and \nproject interventions will be focused in the Tonle Sap region and border provinces.6  \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCambodia\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  grew  by  an  average  of  4.7%  over  FY2007\u2013\nFY2010,  and  is  projected  to  grow  by  an  average  of  6.6%  over  FY2011\u2013FY2014.  To  sustain \neconomic growth and achieve national goals, Cambodia needs to become globally and regionally \ncompetitive.  However,  educational  attainment  is  still  low,  particularly  in  remote  areas;  thereby \npreventing youth from pursuing further education and training and entering the labor market.  \n \n4. \nCambodia  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  basic  education,  particularly  for  girls. \nPrimary net enrollment has risen to 96% for both boys and girls, which led to the lower secondary \nenrollment rate to double. The total gross enrollment ratio for lower secondary education is 58% \n(57% for girls). Gender parity in enrollments has been achieved. However, the lower secondary \nnet  enrollment  rate  is  35%,  below  the  government  target  of  44%.  Rural\u2013urban  disparities  in \nenrollment exist. The education sector is facing several challenges in meeting Cambodia\u2019s Millennium \nDevelopment  Goal  of  universal  9-year  basic  education,  such  as  lack  of  access  to  lower  secondary \nschools, high repetition at the primary level, and dropout at the lower secondary level.7 \n  \n5. \nStudents  are  unable  to  continue  to  lower  secondary  school  because  schools  are \novercrowded  or  remote.  About  40%  of  students  (36%  of  girls)  enrolled  at  the  lower  secondary \nlevel are overage because they have repeated grades at the primary level.8 Students who repeat \ngrades  at  the  primary  level  either  delay  lower  secondary  enrollment  or  do  not  enroll  at  all. \nOverage  students  are  prone  to  dropping  out  of  school.  The  average  dropout  rate  from  lower \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MOEYS). 2003.

Phnom Penh. \n8  Repetition at the primary level impacts lower secondary enrollment, though it has significantly decreased from 12% in \n\nSY2005\u20132006 to 7% in SY2009\u20132010. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nsecondary school is 21.7%.9 Both boys and girls are prone to dropping out. Persistent shortfalls in \naccess, quality, and management need to be addressed to improve enrollment, reduce repetition \nand dropout rates, and achieve basic education goals. \n \nAccess. Access to lower secondary schools is a major issue because of physical distance \n6. \nin rural areas and overcrowding in urban areas. Out of 1,621 communes, 187 do not have lower \nsecondary schools. In some urban and rural areas, schools operate in double shifts and cannot \nabsorb more students. About 1,000 more classrooms and qualified teachers are needed in rural \nand urban areas. Where there are access constraints (often in combination with factors such as \npoor quality of instruction, informal school fees, and the need to support family income), parents \nmay decide to keep children at home or only allow high performers to complete basic education. \nGender-specific constraints prevent equitable access, particularly in remote areas.10 \n \nQuality. The government has made major efforts to improve quality by providing capacity \n7. \ndevelopment  for  teachers  in  teaching  and  learning  methodologies;  modernizing  curricula  and \ntextbooks; and making textbooks available to 50% of students, following the policy to provide one \ntextbook  per  student  per  subject  at  the  lower  secondary  level.  Despite  these  efforts,  the  high \ndropout rate at lower secondary level is partly attributed to inadequately trained teachers, lack of \nteaching  and learning resources,  weak  relevance to labor market  demands,  and lack  of  special \nassistance to at-risk and low-achieving students. Efficiency issues at lower secondary level now \nreceive high priority, given increasing pressure on the system to meet the demand for universal \nbasic education. \n \n8. \nManagement.  The  government  has  decentralized  some  functions  to  the  subnational  level  to \nmake  education  service  delivery  more  efficient.  For  example,  school  operating  budgets  have  been \nprovided to all schools at all levels of education across the country.11 However, key disparities exist in \nthe  governance  and  financing  of  lower  secondary  education  that  undermine  learning  outcomes  and \ninternal  and  external  efficiency.  Such  disparities  include  weak  financial  management  capacity  at  the \nprovincial and district levels, lack of data-based decision-making, and low community involvement. \n \n9.   \nSector  development  program  approach. The government has called on ADB to support \nthe three policy areas of the Education Strategic Plan, 2009\u20132013: (i) equitable access to education \nservices,  (ii)  quality  and  efficiency  of  education  services,  and  (iii)  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building for decentralization. The  sector development program modality  is preferred as it \nprovides policy-based program support to help finance the cost of a new wave of reforms toward \nuniversal  basic  education.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Cambodia  is  closely  aligned \nwith national priorities, including the strategy for education sector development.12  \n \n 10.  Building  on  achievements  of  past  ADB  support.  The  program  is  the  third  in  the \nsequence of education sector development programs. It prioritizes lower secondary education in \norder  to  specifically  address  issues  affecting  universal  basic  education.  The  previous  programs \nsupported  the  education  sector  at-large,  including  vocational  education  and  skills  development. \nThe Third Education Sector Development Program will build on the achievements of the first and \nsecond  programs,  which  increased  access  to  lower  secondary  education  nationwide.  It  will \ncontinue  to  expand  access  while  supporting  policy  actions  for  improved  quality  of  new  school \n\n                                                \n9  In school year SY2010\u20132011, the dropout rate was 22% (22% female) from grade 7 and 22.4% (23.2% female) from \n\ngrade 9. The dropout rate from grade 8 was 20% (21.3% female). These rates are higher in rural areas. \n\n10 Despite  progress  in  girls\u2019  participation  in  basic  education,  gender-specific  constraints  (such  as  household \n\nresponsibilities) remain that require attention to close the gender gap. \n\n11 School  operating  budgets  were  introduced  in  SY2001\u20132002  when  MOEYS  abolished  school  entry  fees.  They \nfinance school operations and facilities maintenance, based on a flat rate per school plus a per capita amount per \nstudent, with different rates for each subsector.  \n\n12 ADB. 2011.

While  the  first  program  introduced  a  decentralized  system  of  school \noperating  budgets  and  supported  increased  allocations  from  the  education  budget  to  school \noperating budgets, the third program will strengthen school-level accountability and support policy \nactions  toward  a  revised  funding  formula  for  school  operating  budgets  that  enables  schools  to \nmeet  students\u2019  needs.  Additionally,  while  the  second  program  addressed  skills  development \namong out-of-school youth, the third program will introduce employability skills development, with \na focus on entrepreneurship, at the lower secondary level in order to improve relevance.  \n \nLessons learned from the first and the second programs. Lessons learned influencing the \n11. \ndesign  of  the  program  include  (i)  balancing  expansion  of  the  education  system  with  quality \nimprovement, and (ii) prioritizing systemic reforms with attention to time frame and capacity of the \nexecuting  agency.  While  project  interventions  under  the  program  are  designed  to  continue  to \nexpand  the  education  system,  they  also  aim  to  build  the  capacity  of  school  management  and \nteachers to address student achievement and progression. Policy actions under the program are \nclosely  aligned  with  project  interventions.  Consultative  processes  were  taken  into  consideration \nduring design of the policy program. Lessons learned influencing implementation of the program \ninclude (i) ensuring full-time staff, and (ii) establishing indicators at the outset with credible data \nsources. Key project staff assigned to the program is full-time. Indicators monitored by the Ministry of \nEducation,  Youth  and  Sports  (MOEYS)  are  in  Appendix  1.  The  country  assistance  program \nevaluation  rated  ADB\u2019s  education  sector  assistance  program  successful  (low). 13 ADB  support  was \nassessed  as  relevant,  efficient,  likely  to  be  sustained,  and  having  a  substantial  impact.  The \nassessment  indicated  that  ADB  could  enhance  its  approach  to  harmonization  with  partners.  The \nprogram builds on the progress made by MOEYS with support from other development partners, \nresulting in greater harmonization with development partners than in past 10 years.14 \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Policy  actions under the  program are  aligned  with \n12. \nreforms for directing resources to schools and strengthening school-based management that are \nsupported  by  the  European  Commission  Budget  Support  Program,  2011\u20132013.  To  implement \nthese reforms, the program will support (i) the reestablishment of the public finance management \nreform working group to promote policy dialogue on education sector financing, and (ii) increased \naccountability  at  the  school  level.  The  program will  expand  the  school  improvement grant (SIG) \nscheme  established  under  the  Education  for  All  Fast  Track  Initiative  to  reach  lower  secondary \nschools  and  enhance  its  focus  to  finance  school-based  enrichment  programs.  It  will  nationally \nscale  up  (i)  school-based  management  training  developed  through  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Cambodia \nEducation Sector Support Program and the United States Agency for International Development\u2019s \nImproved Basic Education in Cambodia, while including data-based decision-making and school \nbudget  planning  skills;  and  (ii)  math  in-service  teacher  training  (INSET)  developed  through  the \nBasic  Education Teacher  Training  Project  under  Belgian  Technical  Cooperation,  while  adopting \nthe  in-service  training  model  established  by  the  Science  Teacher  Education  Project  under  the \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).  The  program  will  pilot  test  science  INSET  in \nthe  Flemish  Association  for  Development  Cooperation  and  Technical \ncoordination  with \nAssistance (VVOB). \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  program  will  be  the  achievement  of  universal  9-year  basic  education. \n13. \nThe  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  increased  lower  secondary  enrollment.  While  the  program \ncomponent will be nationwide in scope, most project investments will be targeted to 14 provinces \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2009.

Policy actions for the issuance of quality control guidelines for new \nschool  building  construction  and  prakas  for  establishment  packages  directly  support  the \nimplementation of investment activities for improving access to lower secondary education.  \n \nGuided  by  the  National  Policy  on  Cambodian  Youth  Development,  the  program  will \n21. \nsupport  a  campaign  to  promote  positive  youth  development,  and  increased  participation  and \ncompletion of basic education, with an emphasis on the benefits of completion for girls.23 \n \nOutput  2:  Improved  quality  of  lower  secondary  education. The program will improve \n22. \nthe  quality  of  lower  secondary  education  by  introducing  innovative  interventions  and  scaling  up \nexisting  successful  programs  of  other  development  partners.  The  program  will  train  school \ndirectors \nimproving  student \nachievement  and  progression,  inclusive  of  dropout  intervention  strategies.  The  program  will \nfinance  SIGs,  which  will  support  school  directors  in  implementing  school-based  enrichment \nprograms. SIGs will be made available to 100 lower secondary schools in the 14 target provinces. \nImplementation of the school-based enrichment program and SIGs will support the policy actions \nfor  the  basic  education  progression  program  and  revised  funding  formula  for  school  operating \nbudgets, inclusive of provision for government-funded SIGs.24 \n\nto  develop  a  school-based  enrichment  program  aimed  at \n\n \n23. \nThe program will scale up to the national level the math INSET pilot project developed and \nimplemented through the Basic Education Teacher Training Project. The method for scaling up will \nbe  training  national  trainers  at  Cambodia\u2019s  six  regional  teacher  training  centers,  to  train  technical \ngroup  leaders  specialized  in  math  at  lower  secondary  schools  nationwide.  The  program  will  also \npilot  test  a  science-INSET  program  for  100  lower  secondary  schools  linked  to  recognized \n\n                                                \n21 Policy actions aligned with those of the European Commission Budget Support Program, 2011\u20132013 include those \nrelated to a revised funding formula for school operating budgets, with provision for a school improvement grant and \nstrengthened school-based management and community involvement. \n\n22 Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents in  Appendix  2)  provides  more  detailed \n\ndescriptions of project interventions. \n\n23 The campaign will address demand-side issues, e.g., parents\u2019 low priority for education and gender-specific constraints. \n24 MOEYS administers SIGs. Implementation of SIGs under the program will enable MOEYS to identify how funds may \nbe utilized to support student achievement and progression through a school-based enrichment program, inclusive of \ndropout intervention strategies.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nsecondary  resource  schools. 25  Collaborative  cofinancing  from  VVOB  will  support  the  science-\nINSET. The Teacher Development Master Plan, 2010\u20132014 and Teacher Development Action Plan \nwill serve as a framework for both INSET pilots. \n \nThe program will support the design and implementation of an employability skills program \n24. \naimed to provide integrated learning experiences for youth aged 12\u201314 years to prepare them for \nthe  future  workplace.26 Design  and  implementation  will  be  guided  by  the  strategic  objectives  of \nthe  National  Policy  on  Cambodian  Youth  Development  related  to  youth  participation  in  the \neconomic  development  of  Cambodia  and  gender.  Learning  experiences  will  support  the \ndevelopment  of  basic  skills  within  the  context  of  entrepreneurship  and  other  areas  supporting \nenterprise. The employability skills program will be designed to foster girls\u2019 empowerment. \n  \n25. \nOutput  3:  Improved  subsector  management.  The  program  will  improve  subsector \nmanagement by building the capacity of school directors in school-based management. It will also \nsupport strengthening  the  role  of  school  support  committees  in school  management through  an \norientation  program.  A  major  focus  of  the  orientation  program  will  be  implementation  of  school-\nbased enrichment programs and SIGs. The capacity development plan will serve as a framework \nfor the  capacity  building  activities. The  program will  pilot  test  basic  education school  clusters to \nstreamline  administration  of  primary  and  lower  secondary  schools  and  enable  sharing  of \nresources  and  greater  community  engagement  in  basic  education  management. 27  This  pilot \ntesting supports the policy action for adopting a new core breakthrough indicator for provincial level \nmonitoring of grade 9 completion to strengthen accountability at provincial and school levels. \n \n26. \nThe program  will follow on from the Enhancing Education Quality Project to enhance the \ncapacity  of  the  National  Institute  of  Education  to  conduct  action  research  by  realizing  impact \nstudies  and  comprehensive  data  analysis  and  evaluation. 28  The  Master  Plan  for  Research \nDevelopment in the Education Sector will serve as a framework. Indicative focus areas for action \nresearch are (i) lower secondary school dropout intervention supported by grant funds, (ii) public \nfinance  management  in  the  education  sector,  (iii)  gender  mainstreaming  in  lower  secondary \nschools,  (iv) a  sustainable  national  scholarship  program,  (v)  employability  skills  at  the  lower \nsecondary level, (vi) improving lower secondary performance through community engagement, \n(vii) expanding child-friendly schools to the lower secondary level, and (viii) methods for INSET. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nrequested both a policy-based loan and project loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \n\nThe program financing is estimated at $30 million equivalent (Table 1).

A critical issue for the government is to ensure that efforts for \nimproving  the  quality  of  education  also  increase  service  efficiency,  given  constrained  public \nfinances. The program aims to promote efficiency by incrementally lowering the total cost of producing \neach grade 9 graduate until a reduction of 19.5% is achieved. Policy actions and project interventions \nunder the program that aim to decrease dropout and repetition throughout the basic education cycle are \nlikely to yield the following efficiency gains: (i) reductions of 10.3% in the average number of years per \nprimary  school  completer  and  14%  in  the  average  number  of  years  per  lower  secondary  school \ncompleter,  and  (ii)  a  reduction  in  the  overall  cost  per  primary  school  completer  to  $38.23  and  per \nlower  secondary  school  completer  to  $78.24.  The  projected  MOEYS  recurrent  budget  indicates \nsufficient resources for allocation to sustain the positive outcomes envisaged under the program. \n\n \nGovernance     \n\nAssessments  of  MOEYS\u2019 \n\nB. \n \n32. \nfinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  were \nconducted,  and  mitigation  measures  identified  (para.  37).32 MOEYS  is  regarded  as  one  of  the \nhigher-performing line ministries in implementing the government\u2019s reform programs for improved \npublic  finance  management  and  decentralization  of  service  delivery.  However,  insufficient \nfinancial  management  capacity  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  including  the  school  level,  is \nforeseen  to  be  a  challenge  to  the  added  responsibilities  and  accountabilities  under  the  next \nphases  of  reform,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  introduction  of  school-based  budget  planning. \nPolicy actions and project interventions under output 3 respond to constraints on the rollout of the next \nphases of public finance management and decentralization in the education sector. Through capacity \ndevelopment in key areas, the program seeks to achieve optimum alignment with government policies \nand systems, as well as ongoing support by development partners. \n                                                \n32 Sector-  and  project-level  risk  assessment  and  management  plan  were  developed  under  ADB.  2008.

The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.33 \n \nC. \n \n34. \nPoverty.  The  program  prioritizes  the  poorest  provinces  of  Cambodia.  Access  to  lower \nsecondary  education  will  be  expanded  in  these  areas  with  the  construction  of  new  school \nbuildings  in communes where  none  exist.  Policy  actions under the  program  will  ensure  that  the \nreview  of  school  operating  budgets  and  guidelines  for  its  implementation  focus  on  equity \ndimensions to ensure improved access, achievement, and completion of basic education among \nthe  poorest  students.  The  program  interventions  will  (i)  empower  school  leadership  to  address \nissues  and  problems  related  to  at-risk  students  from  the  poorest  communities,  (ii)  ensure  that \nschool-based dropout interventions focus on the issues specific to the poorest students that lead \nthem  to  be  at  risk  of  dropping  out  from  lower  secondary  school,  and  (iii)  promote  the  value  of \nbasic  education  attainment  in  terms  of  its  impact  on  the  poorest  communities.  Program \ninterventions  supporting  the  improvement  of  the  overall  relevance  of  teaching  and  learning  at \nlower  secondary  level\u2014through  enhanced  mathematics  and  science  learning  experiences  and \nthe introduction of an employability skills program\u2014will aim to empower the poorest students for \nfurther education and readiness for workforce participation. \n \nGender.  The  program  theme  is  categorized  gender  equity.  The  program  will  address \n35. \nsociocultural barriers to girls\u2019 enrollment, retention, and completion at the basic education level; \nand girls\u2019 achievement of math and science skills and workplace readiness.  The gender action \nplan ensures (i) all new school construction include separate latrines for girls; (ii) guidelines for \nSIGs  to  earmark  funds  for  improving  female  access,  achievement,  and  completion  of  basic \neducation;  (iii)  gender-specific  school-based  dropout  intervention  strategies;  (iv)  100%  of \nfemale  school  directors  and  deputy  directors  are  trained  in  school-based  management  and  in \nimplementing the school-based enrichment program; (v) 50% of national and provincial trainers \nselected  for  inservice  teacher  training  for  mathematics  and  science  are  female;  (vi)  60%  of \nparticipants  in  the  employability  skills  programs  are  female;  and  (vii)  development  of  a  basic \neducation campaign to build awareness of the positive benefits of basic education completion for \nfemales and to promote female participation in the study of mathematics and science. \n\n \nSafeguards  \n\nD. \n \n36. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified B \nfor involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Civil works activities under the program will \nlower  secondary  schools  and  other  school \ncover  small-scale  construction,  with  new \nimprovements  expected  to  be  carried  out  on  government-,  community-,  or  pagoda-owned  land \nsituated  in  non-sensitive  areas.  It  is  not  expected  that  land  acquisition  will  result  in  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts,  but  should  any  permanent  or  temporary  impacts  occur,  a  resettlement \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  provide  guidance  in  the  event  that  a  resettlement  plan  and \ncompensation measures need to be put in place. Civil works and other project interventions will \ntarget  poor  remote  areas,  many  of  which  have  large  populations  of  indigenous  people.  An \nindigenous  peoples  matrix  has  been  prepared  to  (i)  describe  the  circumstances  of  indigenous \npeoples  in  Cambodia,  (ii)  identify  project  impacts,  and  (iii)  describe  mitigation  measures.  The \nprogram is classified category C for environment, having no significant adverse impacts. MOEYS \nwill  appoint  a  staff  member  to  monitor  safeguards  and  ADB  will  provide  training  on  SPS.  The \nresettlement  framework  and  indigenous  peoples  matrix  are  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in \ncompliance with ADB information disclosure. \n \n                                                \n33 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n37. \nKey risks include (i) the mismatch between MOEYS budget allocations and inflation rate, \nspecifically  in  terms  of  program-based  budget  allocations  to  school  operating  budgets;  and  (ii) \nadded financial management responsibilities and accountabilities at the subnational levels as per \nthe  government\u2019s  decentralization  reforms.  Inadequate  allocations  to  school  operating  budgets \nundermine the sector\u2019s policy goals and increase the risk for schools to charge informal fees from \nstudents. This may lead families to withdraw children from basic education because they cannot \nafford  to  pay  such  fees.  Weak  governance  is  a  concern,  with  additional  challenges  created  by \ndecentralization  reforms.  Governance  constraints  are  related  to  planning,  budgeting,  budget \nexecution,  internal  control  and  audit,  and  transparent  reporting  at  the  subnational  levels.  Risk \nmitigating measures include (i) building financial management capacity at the provincial, district, \nand school levels with regard to the introduction of school-based budget planning; (ii) promoting \npolicy  dialogue  with  MOEYS  on  financing  issues  in  the  education  sector  through  the  joint \ntechnical  working  group  on  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  specific  to  the \neducation sector; and (iii) sustaining the joint Ministry of Economy and Finance\u2013MOEYS working \ngroup on financing issues in the education sector.34 \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n \n38. \nThe  government  and  MOEYS  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe  PAM  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  MOEYS  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the loan agreements and that the loan will not be \ndeclared effective until the government, through MOEYS, has fulfilled all conditions for the release \nof the first tranche as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n39. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n the  policy  based-loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR7,870,000  to  the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Third Education Sector Development Program from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreements \npresented to the Board; and \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR11,805,000  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia for the Third Education Sector Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \n \n22 August 2012\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n34 Support for implementation of risk mitigation measures identified during the project governance risk assessment will \nbe  sought  from  ADB.2008.
