It is projected to grow by 7.0% in FY2014 and \n7.3%  in  FY2015.4 The  poverty  headcount  decreased  from  47.8%  in  2007  to  19.8%  in  2011. \nHowever,  approximately  75%  of  Cambodians  live  on  less  than  $3  a  day  and  are  vulnerable. \nAgriculture  remains  vital  to  employment,  particularly  for  women;  however,  its  share  of \nemployment declined from 59% in 2007 to 54% in 2010.5 Foreign direct investment has played \nan increasingly important role in industrial development, creating new investments in automotive \nparts,  electronics,  and  the  agro-industry.  Domestic  consumption,  exports,  and  investment, \nespecially  foreign  investment,  are  projected  to  drive  growth  in  the  medium  term.  However, \ninvestors  indicate  that  an  inadequately  skilled  workforce  is  a  serious  constraint  to  doing \nbusiness  in  Cambodia.6 Progress  in  improving  the  country\u2019s  skills  base  has  been  slow.  From \n2004 to 2010, increases in school enrollment rates reduced the share of the labor force without \nany  formal  education  by  6%.  However,  in  2011/12,  the  proportion  of  working-age  women  (15 \nyears  or  older)  who  had  completed  at  least  secondary  education  (25.8%)  was  below  that  of \nmales (38.6%), indicating gender inequality in access to education and training.7 \n \n4. \nThe  Government  of  Cambodia  emphasizes  the  role  of  skills  development  to  reduce \npoverty  and  promote  inclusive  growth  as  part  of  its  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth, \nEmployment,  Equity  and  Efficiency,  Phase  III  (footnote  2)  and  its  National  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2014\u20132018  (footnote  3).  A  recent  study  conducted  in  collaboration  with \nCambodia\u2019s  National  Employment  Agency  forecasts  an  average  of  1 million  new  jobs  created \nannually from 2012\u20132015.8 While low-skilled occupations are forecast to be in highest demand \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   Government of Cambodia. 2013.

The government identifies the application of technology and business \nmanagement  skills  as  the  main  drivers  of  development  for  all  sectors.  The  government  sees \npotential  for  attracting  foreign  direct  investment  in  light  engineering  and  related  industries  and \ntherefore  prioritizes  middle-level  skills  development  in  auto  mechanics  and  electrical  works \n(footnote 3). To support the growth of industry in Cambodia, a skilled manufacturing workforce \nmust  be  developed.  The  draft  TVET  strategic  plan,  2014\u20132018,  under  preparation  by  the \nMinistry of Labour and Vocational Training (MLVT), will guide TVET sector development to meet \nexisting and emerging labor market needs. \n \n5. \nIssues  in  the  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  system. The formal \nTVET  system  under  the  MLVT  remains  in  its  infancy,  and  gaps  in  TVET  access,  quality,  and \ninstitutional  capacity  constrain  Cambodia\u2019s  workforce  development.  Progression  to  formal \nTVET, which requires grade 9 completion, is less than 1% of secondary enrollments.9 Bridging \nprograms providing out-of-school youth a second chance to complete secondary education and \npursue TVET are very limited. Further, formal TVET is mainly offered in urban areas. Financial \nbarriers  such  as  course  fees  constrain  participation  and  completion  of  formal  TVET. \nParticipation  of  female  students  and  those  living  in  remote  regions  is  deterred  by  the  lack  of \nhousing and limited part-time programs.   \n \n6. \nSome  public  TVET  institutions  offer  certificate  and  diploma  level  courses,  but  only  in  a \nlimited  number  of  fields. 10  The  MLVT  will  establish  regional  training  centers  (RTCs)  in  five \nprovinces to scale up provincial training centers (PTCs) to offer certificate level courses. There are \nvery  few  private  sector  TVET  providers  at  the  certificate  and  diploma  levels.  Most  public  TVET \ninstitutions lack adequate, industry-relevant equipment and training facilities, and the quality of \nTVET  instructors  is  low.  The  formal  TVET  system  emphasizes  theoretical  knowledge  with \nlimited  practical  application.  The  Cambodia  Qualifications  Framework  (CQF)  was  recently \nformulated  to  enable  uniform  certification  processes  among  public  and  private  TVET  providers, \nacross  ministries,  and  between  the  nonformal  and  formal  TVET  systems.  The  voucher  skills \ntraining program (VSTP) expanded under the ongoing Strengthening Technical and Vocational \nEducation  and  Training  Project 11 and  the  skills  bridging  program  (SBP)  initiated  under  the \nPiloting the Post-Harvest Technology and Skills Bridging Program for Rural Poor12 (funded by a \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  grant)  provide  opportunities  for  demand-driven  skills \ndevelopment. However, skills standards and standard training curricula are not applied to either \nprogram,  which  limits  opportunities  for  trainees  to  accumulate  skills  and  undertake  further \ntraining in the formal TVET sector.  \n \n7. \nWhile the National Training Board (NTB) stipulates that TVET be demand driven, there \nis  limited  use  of  systematic  labor  market  information  or  employer  surveys  to  identify  skill \nshortages  to  inform  TVET  course  offerings. 13  Strengthening  capacity  for  managing  and \ncoordinating TVET and involving the NTB in policy formulation and implementation are ongoing \n\n                                                \n9   Annually,  230,000  students  drop  out  before  grade  9,  and  100,000  school  dropouts  enter  the  labor  market.  In \n\nSY2009\u20132010, secondary enrollment was 908,698 and formal TVET enrollment was 746.   \n\n10 Certificate and diploma level refers to middle-level skills development (levels 2\u20134 of the Cambodian Qualifications \n\nFramework).  \n\n11 ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n\n13 NTB is the apex body for TVET policy formulation. NTB is chaired by a deputy prime minister. \n\n\fled \n\npriorities. Weak management and coordination, inadequate financing, and lack of labor market \ndata  have \nto  weak  TVET  program  development,  management,  and  supervision. \nCollaboration with the private sector in TVET policy and program development is nascent, and \ngenerally limited to the development of skills standards and curricula. \n \n8. \nSector  development  program  approach.  The  government  has  requested  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) support for the three policy themes in the draft TVET strategic plan, \n2014\u20132018: (i) equitable access to TVET, (ii) enhanced quality and relevance of TVET, and (iii) \nstrengthened  governance  and  management  of  TVET.  The  sector  development  program \nmodality  will  provide  policy-based  program  support  to  help  finance  reforms  that  seek  to make \nthe  TVET  system  more  relevant  to  the  needs  of  the  labor  market.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia prioritizes development of the TVET sector.14 \n \n9. \nBuilding  on  achievements  of  past  ADB  support.  The  program  is  the  first  sector \ndevelopment  program  focused  on  TVET.  It  follows  earlier  education  sector  development \nprograms  in  Cambodia  that  supported  the  expansion  of  basic  education  and  the  nonformal \nTVET  system  (footnote  11).  The  program  builds  on  the  ongoing  Strengthening  Technical  and \nVocational  Education  and  Training  Project15 to  continue  the  development  of  a  formal  TVET \nsystem  by  (i)  strengthening  RTCs  to  deliver  middle-level  skills  training;  (ii)  implementing  a \ncompetency-based  curriculum,  including  assessment;  (iii)  establishing  sector  skills  councils \nbased  on  the  initial  industry  advisory  groups  formed;  and  (iv)  enhancing  the  VSTP  to  better \nserve  the  majority  of  the  Cambodian  labor  force  who  are  employed  in  low-skilled  agricultural \njobs  and/or  in  the  informal  sector.  The  program  also  builds  on  the  Piloting  the  Post-Harvest \nTraining and Skills Bridging Program for Rural Poor by enhancing the SBP to better serve out-\nof-school youth to enter formal TVET (footnote 12). \n \n10. \nLessons. Program design has been informed by a number of lessons from previous ADB \nTVET assistance:  (i) systemic reforms need to be prioritized in terms of timeframe and capacity \nof  the  executing  agency;  (ii)  TVET  strategies  need  to  be  formulated  alongside  secondary \neducation  development  given  the  large  proportion  of  low-skilled  workers  requiring  secondary \neducation;  (iii)  capacity  building  for  institutional  finance  and  business  planning  is  essential  to \naddress  financial  sustainability  of  costs  for  infrastructure  maintenance,  training  programs,  and \npro-poor subsidies; and (iv) long-term interventions, which allow for evolution in program focus \n(e.g., from access to quality and relevance), are more likely to be sustained.  \n \n11. \nInnovative  features.  The  program  includes  several  key  innovative  features.  Policy \nactions and project interventions will develop an assessment system for the recognition of prior \nlearning  and  current  competencies (RPLCC)  acquired through nonformal  or formal  training,  or \nthrough  work  and  life  experience.  Flexibility  in  the  recognition  of  skills  and  knowledge \nacquisition  will  enable  increased  access  to  TVET  programs.  The  program  also  includes \ninnovative strategies for private sector and employer engagement in TVET sector development, \nsuch as (i) development of centers of excellence (COEs) that teach a single technical subject in \nthe priority sectors of construction, auto mechanics, electrical works, and manufacturing; and (ii) \nan apprenticeship program to provide industry experience to TVET instructors.  \n \n\n                                                \n14 ADB.

Development partners significantly contributing to \n12. \nTVET in Cambodia include ADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency.16 The TVET \ncoordination working group, chaired by the MLVT\u2019s directorate general of TVET (DGTVET), was \nestablished  in  2013  to  promote  policy  dialogue  and  coordinate  support  in  developing  and \nimplementing  the  MLVT\u2019s  TVET  strategic  plan.  The  TVET  coordination  working  group,  which \nconsists  of  representatives  from  development  partners  (ADB,  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency, and others) and the Cambodian Federation of Employers and Business Associations, \nwas consulted during program design. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  impact  of  the  program  will  be  increased  employability  of  TVET-certified  workers. \nThe outcome of the program will be an accessible, demand-driven TVET system responsive to \ncontinuing and emerging labor market demands. The program is nationwide in scope, reaching \npoor and disadvantaged youth living in the poorest communes.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe  program  will  deliver  four  outputs:  (i)  increased  access  to  TVET  programs, \nparticularly for women and the poor; (ii) improved quality and relevance of the TVET system; (iii) \nincreased  involvement  of  employers  in  TVET  delivery;  and  (iv)  strengthened  governance  and \nmanagement of the TVET system. Project interventions and policy actions are closely aligned. \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Increased  access  to  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nprograms.  The  program  will  support  a  sub-decree,  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister,  to \nimplement  the  CQF  for  the  development  of  flexible  pathways  between  different  levels  of \nqualifications,  leading  Cambodians  to  access  education  and  training  opportunities  towards \nlifelong learning and facilitating regional mobilization of Cambodia\u2019s skilled workforce. Access to \nTVET  programs  will  be  increased  through  the  following  policy  actions:  (i)  introduction  of \nvocational  skills  certification  (VSC)  at  CQF  level  1  as  an  alternative  entry  pathway  into  the \nformal TVET system; and (ii) assessment policy and certification policy defining the process for \nRPLCC to allow more qualified Cambodians to enter the formal TVET system.  \n \n16. \nThe project will (i) support the development of qualification requirements for piloting the \nVSC  with  existing  nonformal  TVET  courses  in  auto  mechanics,  construction,  and  information \nand communication technology and/or business offered by public TVET institutions; (ii) train 80 \nstaff  from  the  DGTVET,  public  TVET  institutions,  and  managers  of  assessment  centers  to \nimplement  RPLCC;  (iii)  train  200  assessors  (10%  female)  from  public  TVET  institutions  to \nconduct  competency  assessments  required  for  RPLCC;  and  (iv)  support  piloting  RPLCC, \nincluding  competency  assessments,  for  150  young  adults  (10%  female)  enrolled  in  TVET \ncourses in auto mechanics, construction, and information and communication technology and/or \nbusiness.  RPLCC  will  be  rolled  out to  assess  around  900  Cambodians (70% from the  poorest \ncommunes  and 30%  identified  as disadvantaged) for  competency  in the  above  sectors  over  a \nperiod  of  2  years.  The  project  will  also  support  4,000  poor  and  disadvantaged  youth  (30% \nwomen)  with  stipends for  middle-level  training. Three female  dormitories will  be  built  at  PTCs. \nCareer  mentorship  programs  will  be  piloted  in  these  dormitories. 17 Project  interventions  will \nsupport  the  development  of  a  social  marketing  campaign  to  improve  the  public  perception  of \nTVET and vocationally oriented occupations, particularly among women and the disadvantaged. \n\n                                                \n16 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Pilot will include outsourcing dormitory management and operation and delivery of the career mentorship program.  \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n\fOutput  2:  Improved  quality  and  relevance  of  technical  and  vocational  education \n17. \nand  training  system.  The  program  will  support  a  Prakas  (i.e.,  proclamation),18 issued  by  the \nMLVT, for the registration of TVET institutions to ensure compliance with quality standards. To \noperationalize the registration system, the project will introduce a quality assurance system for \npublic TVET institutions in Cambodia. The program will also support a national TVET policy to \nguide  the  development  of  high-quality,  skilled,  and  capable  human  resources  under  the \ndecentralized  TVET  system  to  promote  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic  development \nthrough innovation and partnerships with key stakeholders, including the private sector.  \n \n18. \nThe  project  will  implement  the  national  TVET  policy  through  (i)  the  establishment  of  a \ncompetency-based  assessment  and  certification  system  including  the  VSC,  and  (ii)  the \nintroduction  of  competency-based  TVET  instructor  training  at  the  National  Technical  Training \nInstitute. An instructor apprenticeship program will be developed to allow instructors from public \nTVET  institutions  to  gain  industry  experience.  Approximately  600  TVET  instructors  will  be \ntrained. Using competency-based training, the project will enhance the quality and relevance of \nthe VSTP and SBP by (i) forming stronger linkages to the labor market,  (ii) alignment with the \nCQF, and (iii) integration of gender inclusive principles in program design. Approximately 35,000 \ntrainees (60% female) will be supported through the VSTP.19 The existing SBP will be improved \nto  include  a  gender-inclusive  learning  module  on  career  opportunities  following  vocational \ntraining.20 The  project  will  also  (i)  target  about  6,400  trainees  (approximately  50%  female)  to \nenroll  in  the  SBP;  (ii)  finance  the  construction  of  one  classroom  building  and  nine  workshops, \nincluding equipment; and (iii) finance rehabilitation of the DGTVET building. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Increased  involvement  of  employers  in  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training delivery.  For greater involvement of employers in TVET delivery, the \nprogram will support issuance of a circular on \u201cPromoting High Quality and Effective Technical \nand  Vocational  Education  and  Training,\u201d  signed  by  the  Prime  Minister,  which  will  facilitate \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  to  ensure  that  access  to  TVET  is  equitable,  responsive  to  the \ndemands  of  the  labor  market,  leads  to  increased  productivity,  and  contributes  to  economic \ndevelopment. The program will support an NTB-approved policy to reform internship programs \noffered by public TVET institutions and to engage the private sector in TVET dialogue.  \n \nThe  project  will  establish  sector  skills  councils  composed  of  industry  associations  and \n20. \nlarge  employers  representing  four  priority  sectors:  construction,  auto  mechanics,  electrical \nworks, and manufacturing. Sector skills councils will be engaged to support the development of \nCOEs in priority sectors, as well as to establish  (i) sector-specific soft skills training programs in \ncooperation with COEs, and (ii) an apprenticeship program for TVET instructors in cooperation \nwith  the  National  Technical  Training  Institute.  The  project  will  also  support  the  reform  of  the \ninternship program in cooperation with industry liaison units and COEs.

To  facilitate  the  management  of  the  TVET \nsystem,21 the  program  will  support  a  Prakas,  issued  by  the  MLVT,  authorizing  specific  public \nTVET institutions to offer fee-based courses to generate revenue from students and employers \n\n                                                \n18 A Prakas or proclamation is a ministerial or interministerial decision signed by the relevant Minister/s. \n19 The VSTP will promote gender equity through identification of skills needs and training programs for women.  \n20 SBP training packages will be outsourced to qualified nongovernment organization TVET providers. \n21 A capacity development technical assistance  project is proposed to strengthen the capacity of DGTVET in  sector \nplanning, budgeting, and the development of the national TVET policy and gender policy. This will further support \nstrengthened governance and management. The technical assistance will be processed separately. \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\n\fwho  finance  employees\u2019  training.  The  program  will  also  support  a  sub-decree,  signed  by  the \nPrime  Minister,  to  direct  the  collection  and dissemination  of  labor market  information  to  inform \ntraining  programs.  The  project  will  build  the  capacity  of  public  TVET  institution  directors  in \nplanning, budgeting, program implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. It will also finance \nstart-up costs for public TVET institutions to deliver courses at CQF levels 2 to 4 in construction, \nauto  mechanics,  and  information  and  communication  technology  and/or  business.  Each  RTC \nwill implement up to 90 courses for approximately 2,700 trainees. Capacity of the 26 PTCs will \nbe strengthened to deliver CQF level 2 training programs in the above sectors. PTCs will deliver \naround 234 courses for approximately 7,000 participants.  \n \nD. \n \nProgram  financing  is  estimated  to  cost  $32.6  million  equivalent  (Table  1).

Five  main  categories  of  beneficiaries  have  been \nidentified: (i) recipients of the stipends for training at CQF levels 2 to 4, (ii) recipients of stipends \nfor internships, (iii) trainees of the enhanced VSTP, (iv) trainees of the enhanced SBP, and (v) \ntrainees  of  public  TVET  institutions  receiving  support  to  deliver  courses  at  CQF  levels  2  to  4. \nUtilization rates are likely to be high because priority skills areas under the project were selected \nbased on an assessment of labor market supply and demand.    \n \n27. \nBased on conservative assumptions, skills development may increase monthly wages by \n18% to 127%, depending on the level of training. Assuming 56% of beneficiaries receive training \nunder the project and utilize their newfound skills and knowledge in the labor market for up to 10 \nyears,  average  annual  earnings  could  increase  by  approximately  $6.0  million  per  year. \nEstimating these benefits over 20 years and using the total project cost of $23.6 million plus an \nannual recurrent cost of $0.1 million yields an economic internal rate of return of 24.0%. \n \n28. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  MLVT  recurrent  budget  increased  from  $13.1  million  in \n2009  to  $26.9  million  in 2013,  while  the  DGTVET  recurrent  budget  tripled  from  $5.4  million  to \n$16.6  million  over  the  same  period.  Increases  in  the  DGTVET  program-based  budget  can \nsustain  key  project  interventions.  Recurrent  expenditures  (e.g.,  additional  operating  costs  of \nPTCs  and  RTCs  and  equipment  maintenance  costs)  can  be  absorbed  by  additional  revenues \nfrom  government  funding.  The  average  incremental  recurrent  cost  under  the  project  is  $0.5 \nmillion per year. The annual government contribution is 16% of the DGTVET recurrent budget. \nThe government\u2019s annual commitment to the project is deemed affordable. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nFinancial management systems are sound, and the MLVT has experience in managing \nADB  disbursements.  While  the  MLVT  has  the  capacity  to  implement  the  program,  it  will  face \nchallenges  in planning  and  budgeting  within  a  decentralized TVET system.  Considerable  work \nremains  on  setting  specific  targets  and  indicators  for  rolling  3-year  periods  and  continuously \nmonitoring  progress  against  targets  related  to  specific  TVET  programs.  Capacity  building  for \nfinancial  management  is  critical  to  the  sustained  delivery  of  TVET.  Governance  challenges \nrelate  to  (i)  financial  accountability  within  a  decentralized  TVET  system,  (ii)  budget  flow,  (iii) \ncapacity  for  budget  allocation,  and  (iv)  lack  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  program  progress \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty.  The  program  prioritizes  skills  development  among \n\nand budget impact. There is a need for clarity on budgets, fund flows, and expenditures at the \nprovincial  and  regional  levels,  and  at  public  TVET  institutions.  Such  information  would  inform \ncost norms and unit costs to facilitate accurate budget planning and resource utilization.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith the government and MLVT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nC. \n \n31. \nthe  poor  and \ndisadvantaged. 26  Increased  access  to  TVET  will  lift  labor  productivity  and  lead  to  higher \nincomes, thus reducing poverty. Policy actions under the program will ensure equitable access \nto  formal  TVET  through  the  introduction  of  the  VSC  and  more  qualified  Cambodians  entering \nformal TVET programs through the RPLCC process. Project interventions will provide stipends \nfor  disadvantaged  youth  and  women  to  attend  formal  TVET  programs.  Training  proposals  for \nstipends from public TVET institutions will include beneficiaries from poor households identified \nby the Ministry of Planning\u2019s Identification of Poor Households Program (IDPoor). Given that a \nlarge  proportion  of  the  labor  force  remains  employed  in  the  agricultural  sector,  the  project  will \nenhance the VSTP. The SBP will be enhanced to reflect competency-based training principles \nto support the entry of out-of-school youth into formal TVET. Social marketing of TVET will build \nawareness of TVET and employment opportunities among poor and vulnerable groups. \n \nGender.  The  program  is  categorized  as  gender  equity  theme.27 It  will  increase  female \n32. \nenrollment,  retention  and  completion  of  formal  TVET,  and  enhance  workplace  readiness.  The \ngender action plan ensures that (i) 30% of those receiving stipends for training at CQF levels 2 \nto  4  are  female,  (ii)  20%  of  females  receiving  stipends  for  training  at  CQF  levels  2  to  4  are \nenrolled in nontraditional areas, (iii) 120 women enrolled in training programs at CQF levels 2 to \n4  and  living  in  dormitories  receive  monthly  career  mentoring,  (iv)  40%  of  the  200  Cambodian \nyouths participating in the competency assessment pilot program are female, and (v) 30% of the \napproximately 9,000 students trained at CQF levels 1 to 4 by RTCs and PTCs are female.   \n \nD. \n \n33. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \nC for involuntary resettlement and B for indigenous peoples. Civil works will involve small-scale \nconstruction, including three women\u2019s dormitories, one classroom building, and nine workshops. \nAll construction will be within existing TVET facilities on government-owned land. The MLVT will \nprovide ADB with an involuntary resettlement screening for subprojects involving construction to \nensure  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies.  The  program  is  expected  to  have  beneficial \nimpacts  on  indigenous  peoples  in  border  provinces.  An  indigenous  peoples  plan  has  been \ndeveloped to improve the distribution of benefits to indigenous peoples.28 \n \n34. \nEnvironment.  The  program  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  Environmental \nimpacts are limited to the construction phase. An initial environmental examination,29 which sets \nout mitigation and monitoring measures, has been prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n \n\n \n\n\fto \n\nimproving \n\nis  committed \n\nfinancial  management \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n35.  While  government \nfor  TVET \ndevelopment,  a  number  of  TVET  sector  financial  management  issues  are  assessed  as  high \nwithout  mitigation,  including  the  lack  of  TVET  recurrent  budget,  and  the  level  of  resources \nrequired  to  implement  the  draft  TVET  strategic  plan,  2014\u20132018.  Policy  dialogue  will  be \npromoted with the MLVT and the Ministry of Economy and Finance on these issues. Other high \nrisks  include  (i)  significant  off-budget  funding,  and  (ii)  weak  financial  management  capacity \namong public TVET institutions. A proposed technical assistance will support DGTVET capacity \ndevelopment for sector planning and budgeting.  Provincial level risks will be mitigated through \ncapacity development of administrators of public TVET institutions. A potential corruption issue \ninvolving unclear roles and responsibilities of provincial level TVET authorities was assessed as \na high risk without mitigation. Policy dialogue will be promoted with the MLVT and the National \nCommittee for  Subnational  Democratic  Development  to  define  the  roles  and responsibilities of \nthe Provincial Training Board in the development of the formal TVET system. The overall risk is \nmedium  with  mitigation  measures.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe government and the MLVT have assured ADB that implementation of the  program \n36. \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  PAM \nand loan documents.
