The infrastructure, facilities, and equipment at the Bichigt \nand Borshoo BCPs are outdated and inadequate to provide high standards of trade facilitation \nand immigration services and accommodate anticipated growth in cross-border trade.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing project on 22 April 2016 and \nthe project loan became effective on 11 July 2016, with ADB providing $27 million in financing \nfrom its ordinary capital resources. The ongoing project comprised the following three outputs: (i) \nimprovement  of \ninfrastructure \nrehabilitation and provision of equipment ($14.25 million); (ii) upgrading of the customs automated \ninformation system; and (iii) preparatory work for the development of a single electronic window \nsystem2 in Mongolia (about $10 million total for outputs 2 and 3).  \n \n\nthe  Altanbulag,  Zamiin-Uud,  and  Bichigt  BCPs \n\nthrough \n\n \n\nA year into implementation, the Government of Mongolia (the government) requested that \nresources  for  the  partial  rehabilitation  of  the  three  BCPs  (output  1)  be  reallocated  to  a \ncomprehensive upgrading of the BCP in Selenge province3 (Altanbulag is the road BCP that only \noperates  24  hours  per  day  in  Mongolia  and  Sukhbaatar  is  the  BCP  for  rail  transport).  ADB \napproved the minor change in scope on 20 October 2017 and, following this approval, output 1 \ncomprised: (i) a comprehensive upgrading of facilities at the Altanbulag BCP; (ii) provision of basic \nequipment to strengthen customs processing capacity at the Altanbulag, Zamiin-Uud, and Bichigt \nBCPs; (iii) construction of a 1.6-kilometer bypass road from the Altanbulag BCP to the main road; \nand (iv)  construction  of  a  single-stop  service center for  all  border  agencies4 at the  Sukhbaatar \nBCP. The ongoing project\u2019s closing date is 31 December 2023. \n \n5. \nThe ongoing project is evaluated as performing well: (i) it is rated on track; (ii) there is full \ncompliance with the safeguard covenants;5 (iii) management of risks is rated successful; and (iv) \n\n                                                \n1  The additional financing is included in ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u22122020\u23afSustaining \nInclusive  Growth  in  a  Period  of  Economic  Difficulty.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2018.  Country  Operations  Business  Plan: \nMongolia, 2019\u22122021. Manila. On 7 December 2018, ADB approved transaction technical assistance for Preparing \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Projects in Mongolia.  \n\n2  As specified in the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business Recommendation Number \n33,  the  Single  Electronic Window  System  is  a  facility  that allows  parties involved  in  trade  and  transport  to  lodge \nstandardized  information  and  documents  with  a  single  entry  point  to  fulfill  all  import,  export,  and  transit-related \nregulatory requirements. If information is electronic, then individual data elements should only be submitted once. \n3  Both Altanbulag and Sukhbaatar BCPs are located in Selenge province, bordering the Russian Federation (Russia) \n\nin the north. Both BCPs belong to Selenge branches of the four border agencies.     \n\n4   According  to  the  Mongolian  Law  on  Border,  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration,  General  Agency  for \nSpecialized Inspection, General Authority for Border Protection and Mongolia Immigration Agency are considered as \nborder agencies.  \n\n5   Since actual construction activities have not started, no safeguards implementation monitoring reports have been \n\nproduced. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ncivil works contracts worth $12.9 million are expected to be awarded in Q4 2019. As of 26 June \n2019, the cumulative contract award amount was $3.20 million, or 11.9% of the net loan amount, \nwhile the cumulative disbursement was $2.18 million, or 8.1% of the net loan amount.  The main \nreasons that contract awards and disbursements are comparatively low are: (i) re-organization of \nthe  government  following  the  parliament  election  in  June  2016;  (ii)  start-up  problems  that  the \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  was  facing  (i.e.,  delays  in  recruitment  of  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  staff;  establishment  of  consultant  selection  committees  and  bid \nevaluation committees and preparation of the terms of reference for major procurement packages; \n(iii)  the  minor  change  of  scope  for  output  1  that  had  to  be  processed  prior  to  the  actual \nimplementation of the project; and (iv) the need to prepare conceptual and detailed engineering \ndesigns  and    realistic  cost  estimates  for  the  proposed  infrastructure  facilities  during  project \nimplementation.  However,  these  start-up  problems  were  resolved  in  close  consultation  with \nexecuting and implementing agencies. Currently, the detailed engineering designs of all proposed \nBCP facilities have been prepared and the procurement of the civil works contractors is ongoing. \nAs  a  result,  over  the  elapsed  project  implementation  period  time  (43%  as  of  26  June  2019), \nimplementation stands at 25%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6. \nAdditional  financing.  The  proposed  additional  financing  is  needed  to  scale  up  the \nongoing  project  by  (i)  comprehensively  upgrading facilities  and  equipment  at  Bichigt  BCP  and \ninclude  Borshoo  BCP,  and  (ii)  providing  capacity  development  support  to  targeted  border \nagencies. \n \n7.  \nDevelopment challenges. The rationale of the ongoing project continues to be valid for \nthe additional financing. As a landlocked country between the PRC and Russia, a large share of \nMongolia\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  is  linked  to  foreign  trade.  From  2009  to  2017,  exports   \nincreased from about $1.9 billion to $6.2 billion. Over that same period, imports increased from \n$2.1 billion to $4.3 billion.6 Mongolia\u2019s exports are heavily concentrated in mineral products, which \nincreased from 40% of total exports in 2004 to 89% of total exports in 2017.7 While this export-\nled growth model contributed to an average economic growth rate of 7% per year from 2009 to \n2018,  the  model  is  highly  vulnerable  to fluctuations  in  mining-related  foreign  direct  investment \n(FDI) and commodity price volatility. Economic growth fell from a high of 17.3% in 2011 to 1.2% \nin  2016,  coinciding  with  a  drop  in  international  mineral  prices,  before  recovering  again  in \nsucceeding years, driven by increases in FDI and exports. \n\n8. \nAnother key constraint on export-led growth is the poor quality of border crossing facilities \n(dilapidated  infrastructure,  use  of  outdated  equipment,  and  low  utilization  of  information  and \ncommunication technology). This results in high trade costs that undermine the competitiveness \nand diversification of Mongolia\u2019s exports. Long and unpredictable transportation times constrain \nexports and weaken Mongolia\u2019s ability to participate in global production networks. Bottlenecks at \nthe border also drive up the cost of importing key inputs for manufacturing, which in turn limits the \ncountry\u2019s production and suppresses exports of manufactured goods. Investments in BCPs and \ncustoms operations can thus significantly reduce trade-related transaction costs while increasing \ncross-border trade volumes. In response, ADB has been supporting the improvement of border \nfacilities in Mongolia. \n \n9. \nThe Bichigt BCP is Mongolia\u2019s closest gateway to the sea through a seaport in the PRC \n(Jinzhou Port), which is connected by extensive road and rail links to the PRC\u2019s northeast. Jinzhou \nPort is one of the few ports in the PRC that is both rail-served and has the capacity to handle \n\n                                                \n6   ADB. 2018.

Ulaanbaatar. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\ntransit trade from Mongolia. However, the Bichigt BCP is underutilized because of the poor state \nof  its  facilities\u2014in  contrast  to  Zuun  Khatavch  on  the  PRC  side  of  the  border,  which  has  high \nthroughput capacity, modern customs facilities, and good connectivity infrastructure.8 \n \nThe anticipated growing strategic importance of the Borshoo BCP in the Western Mongolia \n10. \nand its planned upgrade to international status in 2019 drove selection of Borshoo for additional \nfinancing.9This is in line with a bilateral connectivity agreement between Mongolia and Russia, \nsigned  in  2007,  which  gained  renewed  commitment  following  a  visit  by  Mongolia\u2019s  Minister  of \nForeign  Affairs  to  Moscow  in  May  2018. 10  The  National  Urban  Assessment  for  Mongolia \nconducted  as  part  of  the  ADB  supported  technical  assistance11 in  2017  has  identified  priority \nregional  urban  cluster  systems  as  key  assets  to  catalyze  local  urban  economic  growth.  The \ntranche 1 of the proposed Aimag and Soum Centers Regional Development Investment Program \nwill target west regional urban clusters as Ulaangom (114 kilometer from Borshoo BCP), Ulgii, \nand Khovd. \n \n11. \nThe government expects the two BCPs to become increasingly functional gateways for \nMongolia\u2019s bilateral and transit trade with and through the PRC and Russia. Statistics12 show that \nusage of these BCPs is growing despite their limited capacity. At Bichigt, cross-border passenger \nflows increased by about 80% from 2015 to 2017, while trade turnover more than tripled to $220 \nmillion  during  the  same  period  (with  exports  accounting  for  86%  of  that).13 In  Borshoo,  trade \nturnover increased by 27% in 2018 compared with 2017, from $22.5 million to $28.5 million.14 The \neconomic analysis prepared for the project projected that by 2026 trade turnover in Bichigt will \nalmost double to $400 million (including $95 million in imports), while trade turnover in Borshoo \nwill more than triple to $95 million (mostly imports). Finally, improved BCPs will create regional \nbenefits in the form of cost and time savings. \n \n12. \nKey  innovative  features  of  the  project  include  a  tailor-made  process  for  designing  the \nBCPs  (fully  reflective  of  local  circumstances,  informed  by  the  use  of  real-time  corridor \nperformance measurement and monitoring data); a design process that is used in the BCPs that \nreceive support from ADB has served as a model for support to other BCPs; and preparation of \nconceptual and detailed engineering designs prior to Board approval.  \n \nThe  additional  financing  of  the  ongoing  project  complies  with  the  eligibility  criteria  for \n13.  \nadditional  financing  by  ADB.  The  project  remains  technically  feasible  as  well  as  economically \nviable and financially sound. Activities and outputs under the additional financing are accorded \nhigh  priority  by  the  government  and  are  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020 and the country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2019\u22122021.15 \n                                                \n8  Government resolution No.142 of 10 May 2017 (National Road Development Plan) includes provisions to renovate \nthe  Bichigt  BCP.  The  National  Council  on  Border  Development  (Decree  No.2  dated  7  June  2018)  accorded  the \nrehabilitation of the Borshoo BCP. \n\n9  BCPs with international status can be crossed by 3rd country citizens, i.e., citizens from countries other than the two \n\nbordering countries. \n\n10  The  Russian  Government  is  investing  in  developing  this  border  area  as  a  node  of  cross-border  connectivity  by \nconstructing a connecting road to the M54 federal highway (linking the area to a vast road network), with completion \nexpected by 2020. \n\n11  ADB. 2017.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency and will oversee the overall \nimplementation  and  management  activities.  The  Mongolian  Customs  General \nproject \nAdministration (MCGA) will be the implementing agency. The PIU established under the ongoing \nproject  will  oversee  day-to-day  management  and  liaise  with  all  relevant  government  offices.  A \nproject steering committee, chaired by the MOF, will facilitate successful project implementation. \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nOctober 2019\u2013December 2023 \n31 December 2023 \n30 June 2024 \n\nMOF established and chaired the PSC.

All  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced under the project will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  project  team  will  align  the  project \nimplementation,  procurement,  and  financial  management  with  the  government\u2019s  standard \noperating procedures. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nF. \n\nTechnical \n\n25. \nThe MCGA has embarked on several reform and modernization initiatives aimed at easing \nthe flow of goods and persons across borders. By using information technology in particular, it \nhas  managed  to  improve  operational  efficiency  and effectiveness.  The  government  and  the \nproject team assessed the operations of customs and other border agencies at the two additional \nBCPs, particularly in relation to how the flow of goods and people through the border might be \nimproved and contribute to facilitating trade. Based on the performance of customs agencies and \nan evaluation of existing capacity, the government will procure equipment to enable each BCP to \ncarry out inspections more swiftly and efficiently.24 The project consultants will train the staff on \nhow to use the equipment. \n \nG. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nThe financial analysis included an assessment of financial sustainability of both MOF and \nMCGA to determine the fiscal impact of the incremental recurrent costs, including operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  during  operations.  Similar  to  most  ministries  in  Mongolia,  the \nimplementing agency relies heavily on central government funding. The analysis confirmed that, \ngiven the unpredictability of budget allocations, the risk to financial sustainability is substantial. \nThe analysis indicated that this risk has been sufficiently mitigated through the inclusion in the \nloan agreement of an assurance that the government will allocate adequate budgetary resources. \nThese will cover the recurrent costs associated with O&M of the information technology systems \nand other facilities to  be  upgraded  under  the  project. The  fiscal  impact  of  the  project falls  well \nwithin the government\u2019s projected revenue capacities. \n \n27. \nThe project team found the proposed additional financing to be economically viable, with \nan  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  11.2%  and  economic  net  present  value  of \nMNT11.7 billion. When assessed individually, each investment in the four-total project BCPs are \nalso estimated to yield returns above the 9% threshold. In each BCP, the additional investment \nand recurrent costs are expected to be offset by time savings for customs officials and travelers, \nas  well  as  for  transporters  and  traders  from  faster  turnaround  of  goods;  and  increased  trade \nactivity in the project BCPs, which are in strategic locations along Mongolia's borders with Russia \nand the PRC. The overall project has an economic internal rate of return of 14.4% and economic \nnet present value of MNT53.2 billion. \n \n\n                                                \n24 Including but not limited to x-ray machines, testing equipment for narcotics and explosives, closed-circuit television, \n\nand base station monitors and surveillance. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nH. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nThrough the financial  management  assessment update,  the  project team  assessed  the \ncapacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (as  the  executing  agency)  and  the  PIU,  which  has  been \nperforming satisfactorily  on  the  ongoing project  and  will  continue to  handle all  project financial \nmatters.  The  updated  financial  management  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall \nproject financial management risk is moderate. This rating is based on the observation that the \nPIU  is  well-established  and  functioning  well.  To  further  improve  project  governance,  the \ngovernment will strengthen the PIU\u2019s internal audit function. Since the project concerns additional \nfinancing  that  will  be  implemented  by  the  same  PIU  and  through  the  same  implementation \narrangements  as  the  ongoing  project,  the  same  guidelines  for  procurement  and  consulting \nservices will be followed.     \n\n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nI. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nAs a landlocked country, Mongolia needs to improve trade facilitation, enter into transit \nand international trade arrangements, and attract FDI to boost its competitiveness and promote \nsustainable  and  inclusive  growth.  Constraints  such  as  inadequate  BCP  infrastructure  and \ncumbersome  border  procedures  must  be  overcome  to  improve  the  performance  of  CAREC \ncorridors, minimize the economic impact of Mongolia\u2019s geographic isolation, foster more diverse \neconomic activity, and realize the full economic potential of the country. Encouraging local people, \nespecially women, to participate in cross-border trade is another priority.  \n \n31. \nDirect impacts of the project will be improved efficiency of importing and exporting and \nincreased  local  employment  opportunities  resulting  from  an  increase  in  trade.  By  eliminating \nphysical  and administrative obstacles  to trade  at BCPs, the  project  will  contribute to  a general \nlowering  of  goods  prices.  Better  infrastructure  at  BCPs,  modern  equipment,  and  streamlined \ncustoms  procedures  will  reduce  waiting  times  at  BCPs  and  ease  the  flow  of  products  across \nborders. Improved trade logistics will decrease the cost of doing business. These should lead to \nlower  consumer  prices  in  markets,  thereby  contributing  to  improved  living  standards  and \nincreased international competitiveness for Mongolia.  \n\n \n32. \nRegarding  gender  mainstreaming,  the  project  is  classified  some  gender  elements.  A \ncomprehensive policy and legal framework will deal with gender and social dimensions. Improved \naccess to economic opportunities such as cross-border trade and enhanced rights and security \nwill help minimize gender disparity. The social development action plan outlines proactive gender \ndesign features, indicators, and targets. The project design includes actions to build the capacity \nof customs and border staff to address communicable diseases and respond to human trafficking, \nsexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse. \n \nJ. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n33. \ncategories are as follows.  \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  team  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental \n34. \nexamination  (IEE),  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), for the components to be supported through additional \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nfinancing. The project team has discussed the IEE with the central government counterparts and \nthe  staff  of  the  two  BCPs.  The  EMP  outlines  mitigation  and  monitoring  requirements  and \ninstitutional responsibilities to ensure proper environmental management throughout construction \nand O&M. The executing agency, through the PIU, will be responsible for the implementation of \nthe EMP and for compliance with Mongolian national laws and regulations, including inspection, \nmonitoring, reporting, and corrective actions or measures. 25 \n \n35. \nNo unprecedented or irreversible impacts on the environment are anticipated. Short-term \nimpacts are anticipated during construction, including dust, noise,  and waste generated during \nearthwork  and  civil  works  activities.  O&M  training  and  performance  monitoring  will  minimize \noperational impacts and risks and optimize environmental benefits. The project\u2019s climate change \nimpact will be low. The IEE concludes that effective EMP implementation, together with training, \nwill result in residual impacts within the limits of the Mongolian standards defined in the EMP. The \nPIU has a proven track record in supporting the implementation of safeguards. No further capacity \ndevelopment will be required. The project team disclosed information and conducted meaningful \npublic  consultations  for  the  project  components  through  face-to-face  meetings  with  local \ninhabitants  at  four  locations  near  the  Bichigt  BCP  on  13  May  2019,  and  in  Sagil  County  and \nUlaangom center near the Borshoo BCP on 19\u221222 May 2019. MOF will establish a project-level \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  in  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirement  to  receive  and  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  about  the  project  during  the \nconstruction  and  operation  phases.  The  GRM  includes  procedures  for  receiving  grievances; \ndocumenting key information; and evaluating and responding within a reasonable time frame to \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  concerns  associated  with  the  project  construction  and \noperation. The proposed project-level GRM, including a time-bound flowchart of procedures, is \nincluded in Section G of the project EMP.26 \n \n36. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). There will be no land acquisition or involuntary \nrestrictions on land use or access to legally designated parks and protected areas. The Borshoo \nBCP is located on land owned by the local Customs Office, while the Bichigt BCP will be relocated \non vacant state-owned land that has not been allocated to any entities.27 Therefore, the project \nwill not physically or economically displace any persons or households or adversely impact the \nlivelihood or sources of income of any persons or households. \n \n37. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). There are no communities near the BCPs. The BCPs \nare located in provinces inhabited by ethnic groups such as  Dariganaga, Durvud, and Khoton. \nThey  are  not  considered  distinct  indigenous  groups  by  the  government  or  ADB\u2019s  indigenous \npeoples\u2019 criteria.  \n \n\n                                                \n25 On behalf of the government, the PIU has updated the IEE for the ongoing project to reflect the change of scope; the \n\nEMP for the ongoing project is included in relevant bidding documents.  \n\n26 The additional financing is complemented by an ongoing ADB-supported project that seeks to strengthen sanitary \nand  phytosanitary  measures  around  cross-border  trade  (ADB.  Mongolia:  Regional  Upgrades  of  Sanitary  and \nPhytosanitary Measures for Trade Project.)  \n\n27 As  confirmed  through  a letter  from  the  Mongolian  General Authority  for  Border  Protection  (dated 27 June  2019), \nwhich stipulated that, in accordance with Clause 26.1 of Article 26 of  the Mongolian Law on Border effective on 1 \nFebruary 2017, \u201cState border is the territory that has set up special procedure without enforcing  the state borders \nregulation, setting up borders and checking authority, setting up border engineering and technical facilities for more \nthan 15 kilometers within the national boundary line. The BCP at Bichigt and the security of the border port are an \nintegral part of state border protection.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nK. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe benefits and impacts of the overall project are expected to outweigh the costs and \nrisks, while the overall risk after mitigation measures are in place will be moderate. Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.28  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nExpanded project scope, which will require recruitment \nof an additional project management specialist, with \nstrong financial management skills, and additional \nprocurement staff.
