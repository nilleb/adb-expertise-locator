The  project  will  play  a \nate  sector  solar \ne region. \n\n3. \npioneering  role  in  demonstrating  the  commercial  viability  of  large-scale  priv\nfarms, a model that can then be replicated by other private sector investors in th\n \n4. \nThis transaction and its potential demonstrational impact is made possib\nof  unique  transaction  factors.  The  challenges  that  often  accompany  large-sca\nare mitigated by (i) BCP\u2019s strategic focus on renewable energy projects and it\nstrength;  (ii)  the  Government  of  Thailand's  commitment  to  clean  energy  throu\nfeed-in tariff; (iii) regulatory stability; (iv) a reduction in the cost of photovoltaic\nsupply-capacity  buildup  in  the  solar  industry;  and  (v)  experience  gained \nworldwide. Moreover, the viability of the project is bolstered by ADB's combina\nproducts, including ADB\u2019s long-term baht loans, its role in mobilizing commercial bank fundi\nthrough  the  risk  participation,  and  the  proposed  availability  of  pre-financed  c\nreductions (CERs) from ADB's Future Carbon Fund. ADB's long-term local cur\nBCP  the  tenor  it  needs  to  fund  a  power  generation  plant  that  has  a  long  as\nupfront  investment  costs,  but  no  ongoing  fuel  costs.  In  addition,  the  innova\nmechanism allows ADB to extend the tenor of the cofinanced tranche and ass\ncommercial banks, which have limited experience in financing clean energy proj\n \n5. \nwer  because  of \nADB\u2019s  proven  experience  in \nfinancing  renewable  energy  combined  with  its  strong  mandate, \nreputation  and  commitment  to  facilitating  the  transition  by  DMCs  to  low-carbon  economies.  In \naddition,  BCP  and  ADB  share  the  long-term  objective  of  achieving  low-carbon  growth  while \nadhering  to  best-practice  environmental  standards.  For  BCP,  ADB  is  a  potential  long-term \npartner  in  reaching  its  carbon  neutral  goal.  As  a  creditor  and  investor,  ADB  strongly  supports \ncompanies  that  have  sound  corporate  governance  structures  and  sustainable  development \npolicies, an area in which BCP has become a prominent leader within Thailand. The alignment \nin values between ADB and BCP supports the formation of a long-term partnership that would \ninclude future clean energy projects.  \n \n\nle by a number \nle  solar  projects \ns balance sheet \ngh  a  supportive \n material, due to \nby  the  industry \ntion of financial \nng \nertified  emission \nrency loan gives \nset  life  and  high \ntive  risk  sharing \nists in attracting \nects in Thailand.  \n\nBCP  has  chosen  ADB  as  a  strategic  partner  to  expand  into  solar  po\n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nSector Overview \n\ns of December \n  (MW),  71%  of \nnergy policy has \nwer  generation. \ns  magnified  the \n  to  depend  on  imports,  because \ndigenous oil and \n\n6. \nThailand is one of the largest electricity consumers in Southeast Asia. A\n2009,  installed  power  generation  capacity  in  Thailand  was  29,211  megawatts\nwhich was sourced from natural gas and 19% from coal and lignite. Its recent e\nstressed  the  importance  of  diversifying  and  securing  sources  of  fuel  for  po\nOverreliance  on  natural  gas,  coupled  with  exposure  to  oil  price  volatility,  ha\ncountry\u2019s  political  and  economic  risk.  Thailand  continues\ndomestic demand for commercial primary energy outpaces the discovery of in\ngas. Supplementary Appendix A reviews Thailand\u2019s power sector in detail. \n \n7. \nThailand's growth rates in energy consumption are much higher than its\n respective GDP \ngrowth rate. Moreover, energy consumption gives rise to over 50% of the count\nry's greenhouse \ngas  (GHG)  emissions. 1   If  unchecked,  Thailand's  rapidly  growing  energy  consumption  will \ninvariably increase the economy\u2019s carbon intensity. In its most recent Power Development Plan \nailand  (EGAT) \n(2010),  published  in  April  2010,  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Th\nannual  average \nprojected  an  average  growth  rate  of  4.22%  in  energy  demand  and  a  4.19% \nincrease in peak demand between 2008 and 2030.2 \n \n8. \nFortunately,  Thailand  has  abundant  renewable  energy  sources\u2014b\nmini-hydro,  solar,  and  wind.

As  part  of  the  strategy  of  di\nenergy,  the  government  has  prepared  an  Alternative  Energy  Development  Pla\nand  set  a  target  of  20.3%  for  primary  commercial  energy  from  renewable  en\n2022.  This  implies  a  renewable  energy  capacity  of  5,608  MW  by  2022,  a  sig\nfrom the present 1,754 MW; 4 this can be achieved only with concerted efforts fr\nthe private sector sponsors and financial institutions. \n \ny  is  advocating \n9. \nTo  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy  the  Ministry  of  Energ\n producer (SPP) \ndecentralized power generation, mainly by supporting the country\u2019s small power\nivate developers \nand very small power producer (VSPP) programs. The SPP program allows pr\nto  build,  own,  and  operate  10  MW\u201390 MW  power  projects  and  enter  into \npower  purchase \nagreements (PPAs) with EGAT.\n Under the VSPP program producers of up to 10 MW may sell \npower to the Metropolitan Electricity Authority and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). The \ncountry\u2019s 161 VSPPs contribute just over 1% of total power generation, while the more than 60 \nSPPs  account  for  8%  (footnote  2).  Renewable  energy  SPPs  and  VSPPs  can  receive  higher \ntariffs  through  an  \u201cadder\u201d  (feed-in)  tariff  in  addition  to  th\ns \nreceive  a  fixed  adder  subsidy  of  B8  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  for  10  years  f\nrom  the  start  of \ncommercial  operations. 5   Supplementary  Appendix B  discusses  Thailand\u2019s  re\nnewable  energy \npolicies and incentives at greater length. \n \n\niomass,  biogas, \nergy  can  boost \nom  global  price \nversifying  the  energy  mix  and  promoting  renewable \nn3  (2008\u20132022) \nergy  sources  by \nnificant  increase \nom the regulator, \n\ne  normal  tariff.

Once \nthe adder expires, the project will be exposed to \nmarket risk with respect to the wholesale electricity tariff. This ris\nk is mitigated by \nthe full-recourse nature of ADB\u2019s loan and the fact that a signific\nant level of debt \namortization will have occurred by the time the adder falls away. \n\n the project will \ne purchased by \nble  state-owned \nof  its  payment \nl  crisis.

Sudden changes or reversals in government policy toward the \nenergy sector may negatively affect cash flow from BCP\u2019s operations. Regulatory \nrisk  is,  however,  expected  to  be  minimal  in  the  Thailand  electricity  sector  given \nthe  priority  and  public  commitment  given  by  the  government  to  the  support  of \nrenewable  energy  resources.  Moreover,  changing  a  publicly  announced  policy \nwould  set  an  unpopular  precedent  and  undermine  investor  confidence  in  the \nsector.

Without  strong  legislative  frameworks  and  inc\ncarbon  taxes  or  \u201ccap  and  trade\u201d  emissions  trading  schemes,  DMCs  must  rely\nindustry  leaders  within  the  private  sector  to  initiate  environmentally  sustainabl\ntake into account their overall carbon footprint and aim to reduce emissions on \nbasis. \n \n62. \nBCP is emerging as a leader in sustainability within the energy industry\n in ADB\u2019s DMCs \nas  it  commits  to  neutralizing  its  carbon  footprint  by  developing  utility-scale \nsolar  power  and \nreducing  carbon  emissions  across  its  operations.  BCP  has  initiated  a  proact\nive,  zero-carbon \nstrategy  that  will  reduce  its  environmental  impact  and  enhance  the  long-term  sustainability  of \nvestment  in  biofuels  and  a  larger \nthe  company.

The  TA  will  include  (i)  the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  system  to  determine,  track,  and  monitor  BCP\u2019s  carbon \nfootprint on a company-wide basis and implement strategies to offset carbon emissions with an \n\n                                                \n \n25  ADB. 1966.
