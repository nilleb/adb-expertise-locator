The  present \ncondition of the road is very poor, and this is suppressing the development of one of the poorest \nareas of the country. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nGeorgia is located in the Southern Caucasus, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. It is \nan  important  transit  corridor for many  countries in Central  and West  Asia,  especially  Armenia, \nAzerbaijan,  Turkey,  and  Russia.  As  a  result  of  economic  and  institutional  reforms  and  sound \nmacroeconomic  policies,  Georgia\u2019s  economy  expanded  by  9.6%  annually,  on  average,  during \n2003\u20132007,  and  withstood  the  effects  of  the  2008  armed  conflict  with  the  Russian  Federation \nand the global financial crisis. Despite these challenges, Georgia\u2019s gross domestic product per \ncapita rose from $916 in 2003 to $4,428 in 2014, although it subsequently declined to $3,789 in \n2015.  Even  though  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  forecast  suggests  real  gross  domestic \nproduct growth of only 2.7% in 2016, its forecast is that growth will accelerate to 4.0% in 2017 \nand 5.0% in 2018.2 \n\n4. \nEconomic  growth.  Georgia\u2019s  strong  growth,  as  a  result  of  broad  economic  and \ninstitutional  reforms  since  2003,  has  not  delivered  commensurate  declines  in  unemployment \nand poverty.  Infrastructure gaps,  agricultural  stagnation,  and an  entrenched skills  mismatch  in \nthe  labor  market  have  dampened  the  impact  of  growth  on  poverty  reduction.  The  official \nunemployment rate rose from 11.5% in 2003 to 16.9% in 2009, before moderating to 12.4% in \n2014.  The  percentage  of  the  population  living  below  the  relative  poverty  line  declined  from \n24.9% in 2004 to 21.4% in 2013. The Gini coefficient in 2014 remained high at 0.41, reflecting \nthe concentration of income growth in urban areas and among the top 10% of income earners. \nGeorgians living in small towns and engaging in smallholder agriculture have gained little from \nthe overall improvement in the economy since 2003. \n\nDespite recent slower growth, the economic outlook is positive. Key areas contributing to \n5. \nthe  economy  are  services  (led  by  trade,  tourism,  and  transport),  manufacturing,  construction, \nand  mining.  The  government\u2019s  \u201cSocioeconomic  Development  Strategy  of  Georgia  (Georgia \n2020)\u201d  targets  inclusive  economic  growth  by  ensuring  macroeconomic  stability  and  effective \npublic administration, improving private sector competitiveness, developing human capital, and \nincreasing access to finance.3 \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International  Monetary  Fund.

Tbilisi. \n\n \n\n\fADB  Assistance  and  Government  Sector  Strategy.  The  proposed  project  was \n6. \nincluded in the country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 and is fully aligned with Georgia 2020, \nwith  transport  as  one  of  the  priority  sectors.4 The  project  is  designed  to  address  internal  and \nregional  market  connectivity  issues  by  improving  social  conditions  and  providing  economic \nopportunities  in  smaller  towns  and  cities,  stimulating  investment,  job  creation,  and  incomes \nwhere  these  are  needed  the  most.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project \npreparatory technical assistance for the Secondary Road Improvement Project (TA 8411-GEO), \nwhich was completed in 2015. \n\n7. \nRoad transport is the country\u2019s principal means of transport. In 2009, ADB approved the \nmultitranche financing facility for the Road Corridor Investment Program of $500 million, mainly \nto assist the government in upgrading two key sections of the country\u2019s principal road corridor, \nthe  East\u2013West  Highway.5 This  is the  main  international  transport  corridor that  traverses  all  the \nmajor  cities  of  Georgia.  The  East-West  Highway  constitutes  a  portion  of  the  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation program road corridors (Georgia joined the program in 2016). \nThe  government  has  prioritized  East\u2013West  Highway  Corridor \nto  ensure \nimprovements in connectivity to global markets. About half of the country\u2019s population relies on \nsecondary roads as they live in villages and smaller towns, and 75% of these people derive their \nlivelihoods from agriculture. A reliable transport network, both primary and secondary, is needed \nto  alleviate  the  poverty  disparities  among  the  country\u2019s  regions,  particularly  in  the  rural  areas \nserved  by  the  secondary  road  network.  Improved  secondary  roads  lead  to  reduced  costs  of \naccess  to  markets  and  services  and  increased  access  for  the  poor  and  isolated  regions,  and \ngenerate direct employment opportunities linking jobs with people. \n\ninvestments \n\nImprovement  Needs.  There  is  a  need  to  improve  connectivity  to  remote  poor  areas. \n8. \nThe proposed project has been designed to address these challenges. It will focus on about 50 \nkm of a secondary road in central Georgia that provides access to about 23,000 people living in \nthe municipality of Kharagauli, and an additional 7,000 people in the 13 villages along the road \nalignment. The project road connects Kharagauli to the East\u2013West Highway, which is subject to \noccasional  closure  because  of  landslides,  in  which  event  the  project  road  provides  an \nalternative  road  for  traffic  using  the  highway.  In  future,  the  project  road  could  serve  as  an \nalternative route, as required by Georgian legislation, in the event that the parallel section of the \nEast\u2013West Highway is to be tolled. \n\n9. \nThe  project  road  has  deteriorated  considerably  and  many  sections  of  it  are  now \nirreparable  and  impassable during rain  and snow.  This  clearly  suppresses the  development of \nthe  poor  region  that  the  road  serves.  Villages  along  the  road  are  not  accessible  during  winter \nand are suffering from substantial out-migration and lack of employment opportunities. The poor \ncondition of the road also prevents emergency vehicles from accessing the villages during most \nadverse weather conditions. \n\n10. \nThis area has the highest regional poverty level of any region in the country. The project \nwill  help  alleviate  isolation  of  rural  communities  in  this  area,  strengthen  domestic  trade,  and \nexpand  opportunities  for  more  inclusive  economic  growth.  Upgrading  of  the  road  to  an  all-\nweather  standard  will  provide  better  opportunities  of  the  local  population  to  sell  their  products \nand better access to social facilities such as schools and medical services. The improved road \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Georgia, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n5  ADB.  2009.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fwill  also  facilitate  access  to  the  nearby  Borjomi\u2013Kharagauli  National  Park  and  Nunisi  Health \nResort, resulting in new opportunities for tourism development in the region. \n\n11. \nPreservation  of  Road  Assets  and  Sustainability  of  the  Secondary  Road  Network. \nThe existing road will be improved to two-lane all-weather standard to the extent possible within \nthe existing road formation to minimize land acquisition and resettlement. Because the existing \nroad  is  located  on  a  narrow  bench  between  a  cliff  face,  a  river,  and  a  railway,  substantial \nwidening  and  realignment  would  be  both  difficult  and  expensive.  The  railway  is  located  in  the \nsame corridor for almost the entire length of the project road, which provides the opportunity for \nthe road  and  the railway  to  act  together  as  a multimodal transport  corridor through the  project \narea.  The  project  will  also  improve  connectivity  and  reliability  of  the  transport  network  by \nreviving the road\u2019s role as an alternative in the event that the parallel section of the East\u2013West \nHighway is closed. \n\n12. \nLooking  at  the  secondary  road  network  more  generally,  the  proportion  of  Georgia\u2019s \nsecondary roads in good and fair condition increased from 30% in 2004 to around 60% in 2015 \nas  a  result  of  major  rehabilitation  efforts  since  2004.  About  one-third  of  the  rehabilitated \nsecondary roads were financed by the World Bank during 2004\u20132015 and the remaining portion \nwas financed by the government. While the annual state budget for 2015 allocated about $300 \nmillion  for  improvement  of  the  country\u2019s  international  and  secondary  roads,  there  is  still  a \nsecondary road rehabilitation backlog and also a need to preserve the recently improved road \nassets.  Generally,  routine  maintenance,  including  winter  maintenance,  remains  underfunded. \nExpenditure  on  routine maintenance for  both international  and secondary  roads averages $17 \nmillion  per  year,  which  represents  less  than  $2,500  per  km  per  year  and  is  less  than  the \ninternational comparator range of $4,000\u2013$8,000 per km. Ensuring that recent improvements in \nimplementation  of  maintenance  are  sustained  is  a  major  challenge  for  the  government.  The \nWorld  Bank  is  continuing  its  support  to  the  Roads  Department  with  integrating  a  road  asset \nmanagement  system, 6 road  safety,  and  climate  resilience  planning  practices  in  a  multiyear \nprogramming and annual planning process.7 \n\nfinanced  by \n\n13. \nDevelopment  Coordination.  The  proposed  project  will  complement  the  work  being \ndone  by  development  partners  and  ADB  under  the  2009  multitranche  financing  facility  to \ndevelop  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Regional  Development  and  Infrastructure  (MRDI)  and \nRoads  Department  for  effective  sector  management,  and \nin  particular  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  country\u2019s  road  network.  Institutional  capacity  will  be  strengthened  through \nconsultancy  services \nthe  project  and  continuous  cooperation  with  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  government  is  committed  to  providing  the  funding  required  to \nmaintain the road in a sustainable manner. Development partners have jointly conducted policy \ndialogue  to  improve  road  maintenance  and  enhance  the  sustainability  of  road  networks.  Such \nefforts  have  been  focused  on  three  main  areas:  (i)  increasing  the  fiscal  budget  allocation  for \nroad  maintenance,  (ii)  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating  international  and  secondary  roads  in \npoor  condition  and  thereby  reducing  overall  demand  for  road  maintenance  funding,  and \n(iii)  spending  the  fiscal  budget  allocated  for  road  maintenance  more  efficiently.  Further,  in  the \nevent  that  the  East\u2013West  Highway  is  tolled,  the  revenues  from  the  tolling  can  be  used  for \nmaintenance  of  the  project  road  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  project.  Future  projects \nprogrammed  for  the  sector  will  continue  this  development,  reflecting  the  intention  of  the \n\n                                                \n6  The road asset management system is a tool for the analysis, planning, management, budgeting, and appraisal of \n\nroad maintenance meeting the targets set, such as the average condition of the road network as an example. \n\n7  This process will be carried out under the World Bank\u2019s Secondary Road Asset Management Project, which was \n\napproved on 18 March 2016 and will be implemented during 2017\u20132022. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\ngovernment  and  ADB  that  all  operations  in  the  transport  sector  exist  within  a  common \nframework. \n\n14. \nLessons  Learned. The programs implemented under previous ADB country strategies \nhave been found to have addressed the country\u2019s needs. Operations that were completed have \nbeen  successful,  and  ongoing  operations  are  likely  to  achieve  their  goals.  Responding  to  the \nrecommendations  provided  by  the  country  strategy  final  review  and  ADB\u2019s  Independent \nEvaluation  Department\u2019s  Validation  Report  of  the  Final  Review  of  Country  Operations,  the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 includes a sharper focus on infrastructure for inclusive \ngrowth,  for  example  by  targeting  secondary  roads  and  smaller  towns  in  poorer  regions. 8 \nAdditionally,  lessons  from  earlier  operations  include  the  need  to  address  in  future  operations \n(i)  a  lack  of  preparedness  before  project  start-up;  (ii)  poorly  defined  terms  of  reference  for \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants;  and  (iii)  weak  project  management \ncapacity of the government agencies responsible for the operation, including in the critical areas \nof contract management and safeguards. \n\nThese  lessons  have  been  reflected  in  the  project  design  by  (i)  conducting  advance \n15. \ncontracting  actions  and  undertaking  a  careful  review  of  the  terms  of  reference  for  detailed \ndesign and construction supervision consultants; (ii) providing guidance and practical support to \nthe  executing  and  implementing  agencies  on  ADB  policies,  guidelines,  and  procedures  on \nresettlement,  and  procurement;  and \nenvironmental  protection, \n(iii)  preparing  technical  designs  that  are  much  closer  to  final  designs  so  cost  estimates  and \ncontract periods are more reliable, and subsequent contract prices and overall project costs are \nless  subject  to  unexpected  and  often  large  cost  increases.  For  this  project,  adverse  impacts \narising from delays in land acquisition have been minimized by designing the road to the extent \npossible  to  follow  the  existing  alignment,  and  also  through  the  extensive  consultation  with \ncommunities in the project area. The consultations will continue during the detailed design and \nproject implementation activities. \n\nland  acquisition  and \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nThe project impact will be aligned with the increased economic activity in the Kharagauli \nmunicipality and surrounding regions and national connectivity. The outcome will be increased \nmobility  and  accessibility  of  the  residents  of  Kharagauli  municipality  and  tourists  visiting  the \nproject area by reducing vehicle operating costs and providing time savings for road users. \n\nC. \n\nOutput \n\n17. \nThe  project\u2019s  output  will  be  about  50  km  of  improved  road  between  Dzirula  and \nChumateleti, including several short access roads to the nearby national park and to Kharagauli \nand other railway stations. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n18. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $93.8 million (Table 1). \n\n \n\n                                                \n8  Independent Evaluation Department. 2013.

For the main road \nalignment, the completed road\u2019s cross section will typically be traffic lanes of 2.0 meters (m) by \n3.0  m  with  0.5  m  surfaced  shoulders  and  0.5\u20131.0  m  unpaved  shoulders  on  both  sides. \nThis  complies  with  the  Georgian  standard  for  roads  of  this  category.  The  national  park  and \nrailway  station  access  roads  will  be  designed  to  a  standard  appropriate  for  their  intended \npurpose, with gravel pavements, considering the terrain through which they pass. \n\n23. \nThe project road\u2019s main alignment will follow the existing alignment for most of its length \nbecause of terrain considerations and also to minimize land acquisition. The design speed will \ntypically be 40 km per hour, which is appropriate for a road of this class in the terrain through \nwhich it passes. Appropriate lane widening will be applied on low radius curves to allow the safe \npassage of the larger trucks and buses that are expected to use the road. \n\n24. \nThe  road\u2019s  main  alignment  will  have  a  flexible  pavement  with  asphaltic  concrete \nsurfacing.  The  pavement  structure  will  be  designed  using  an  appropriate  internationally \nrecognized  design  method  based  on  traffic  projected  to  use  the  road  over  a  20-year  period \nfollowing  project  completion,  from  2020  to  2039,  assuming  a  mid-period  asphaltic  concrete \noverlay  to  provide  the  additional  strength  required  for  traffic  loading  for  the  latter  part  of  the \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\froad\u2019s service life.10 The pavement design, under the detailed engineering design contract, will \ntake into account the harsh climatic conditions that prevail in the project area, specifically heavy \nsnowfalls. The design will give particular attention to drainage and to pavement damage arising \nfrom the operations of snow-clearing equipment. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nEconomic.  The  project  has  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12.6%,  with  a  net \npresent  value  of  $2.3  million  at  a  12.0%  discount  rate.  The  principal  benefits  are  reduced \nvehicle operating costs, reduced travel time, and reduced maintenance costs compared with the \nwithout-project  situation,  together  resulting  in  increased  regional  and  local  trade  and  road \nsafety.  Additional  benefits  from  the  road  providing  a  bypass  for  when  the  parallel  East\u2013West \nHighway  is  closed,  which  have  not  been  evaluated,  would  improve  the  economic  merit  of  the \nproject. \n\n26.  With respect to maintenance, the project\u2019s economic and financial analysis has assumed \nthat maintenance costs will be $1,300 per km on average.11 This is assessed to be adequate for \nthe  road  type  and  traffic  loading.  In  addition,  the  analysis  assumes  asphalt  overlays  at \nappropriate intervals during the road\u2019s service life. \n\nFinancial. The MRDI is a general government sector unit and the project is nonrevenue \n27. \ngenerating. The financial management assessment undertaken during project preparation, and \nas described in the financial management assessment, assessed the MRDI\u2019s financial capacity \nto  sustainably  maintain  the  project.  These  analyses  concluded  that  the  MRDI  has  sufficient \nfinancial management capacity, within the government\u2019s budgetary procedures, for the recurrent \nexpenditures required for maintaining and operating the project in a sustainable manner. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nThe above-referenced financial management assessments revealed that both the MRDI \nand  the  Roads  Department  have  a  current  and  adequate  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  financial \nmanagement policies and implementation procedures as a result of the extensive ongoing ADB-\nsupported operations in the country. The project financial statements will be audited annually by \nan  independent  auditor.  Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the \nannual  audit  reports  on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy 2011. \n\n29. \nA  procurement  risk  assessment  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for \nAssessing  Country,  Sector,  and  Procurement  Risks.12 The  Roads  Department  is  fully  staffed \nand  functional  and  is  currently  implementing  projects  financed  by  ADB,  European  Investment \nBank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and World Bank. The Roads Department strictly \nfollows  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  bidding \nprocedures in procurement of works contracts and ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  in  recruiting  consulting  services  financed  by  ADB. \nThe  assessment  concluded  that  the  Roads  Department  has  adequate  capacity  to  ensure \nsuccessful  procurement  and  implementation  of  the  project.  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  risks  have  been \n\n                                                \n10 The feasibility study pavements were designed using the internationally recognized American Association of State \n\nHighway and Transportation Officials\u2019 design method. \n\n11 Economic and Financial Analysis (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 ADB. 2015. Guide on Assessing Procurement Risks and Determining Project Classification. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nidentified  and  assessed  low,  with  limited  impact  on  the  proposed  project.  Overall,  there  is  no \nexpected immediate risk to the proposed project\u2019s procurement that would require mitigation. \n\nADB\u2019s  Integrity  Principles  and  Guidelines, 13  and  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \n30. \namended  to  date),  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  MRDI,  and  the \nRoads  Department.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nBased on the social impact assessment undertaken during the project\u2019s feasibility study, \nthe  project  promotes  inclusive  growth  by  targeting  two  regions\u2014one  (Shida  Kartli)  with  the \nhighest poverty rate in the country (59.4%) and the other (Imereti) significantly poverty affected \n(19.1%); the national average is 9.4%.14 All residents (approximately 30,000) along the project \nroad will benefit from an all-weather road, shorter travel times, reduced vehicle operation costs, \nand  improved  traffic  safety  with  improvement  of  the  project  road.  This  will  be  particularly \nbeneficial  for  the  project  area,  which  is  subject  to  harsh  weather  conditions,  including  heavy \nsnowfalls  during  winter.  Access  to  markets  for  the  producers  of  agricultural  goods  will  be \nenhanced, as will access to the nearby Borjomi\u2013Kharagauli National Park and the health resort \nat  Nunisi.  The  project  will  also  provide  job  opportunities  for  the  local  communities  during \nconstruction.  However,  there  are  also  adverse  impacts  such  as  physical  and  economic \ndisplacement of households because of acquisition of land, but these are relatively minor.15 \n\n32. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  some  gender  elements.  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  includes  households  headed  by  women  as  a  vulnerable  group  and \nadditional  assistance will  be  afforded to these affected  persons.  Provisions  in the  construction \ncontract will ensure equal pay for equal work. The entrepreneurship training for 100 persons of \nwhom  50%  are  women  will  be  provided  during  the  project  implementation.  In  addition,  road \nsafety  awareness  campaigns  for  communities  with  50%  of  women  and  girls  will  be  organized \nduring  the  project  implementation.  It  is  also  likely  that  benefits  to  women  and  girls  will  be \nrealized  after  project  completion  through  outcomes  such  as  increased  access  (i.e.,  greater \npublic transport frequency, travel speed, days per year accessible) to schools, medical facilities, \nand  markets.  Two  focus  group  (each  with  at  least  8  women)  discussions  towards  project  end \nwill  be  conducted  to  assess  whether  the  project  has  reduced  women's  time,  poverty  and/or \nimproved the quality of their lives.   \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \n\nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) applies to the project. \n\nResettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Based \n34. \non the detailed inventory prepared during the feasibility study, 305 land parcels comprising 803 \npeople will be affected by mostly small-scale land acquisition. Total private land to be acquired \nis 7.2 hectares. There are 15 uninhabited households to be physically relocated or dismantled, \nand  50  households,  comprising  135  people,  will  be  severely  affected  (physically  displaced \nand/or losing 10% or more of income-producing assets). The project\u2019s draft LARP was prepared \nin 2015. Given that civil works will be implemented in two separate contracts, two final LARPs \n(one for each contract) will be prepared during the detailed designs of the project.

A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  once  the  first  final \nupdated LARP is available following the completion of the detailed design process. The Roads \nDepartment,  which  is  experienced  in  implementing  land  acquisition  under  ADB-financed \nprojects and has the required technical capacity, will be responsible for planning, implementing, \nand monitoring the LARPs. \n\n35. \nEnvironment. The project is not anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental \nimpacts  and  has  been  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been  prepared  to  meet \nthe  requirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  this  includes  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP).  The  recommended  environmental  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  activities set out  in the  EMP  cover  the preconstruction,  construction,  and  operation \nstages of the project. The Roads Department has a division for resettlement and environmental \nprotection,  managed  by  a  division  head.  The  division  has  two  safeguards  units,  one  for \nenvironment and the other for resettlement. Both units are well staffed with several specialists \nfor  ongoing  donor-funded  projects.  The  environment  unit  has  one  specialist  dedicated  to  ADB \nprojects.  The  Roads  Department  will  be  assisted  by  the  construction  supervision  consultant\u2019s \nenvironmental  specialists  during  project  implementation.  The  EMP,  which  also  defines  the \ninstitutional arrangements and responsibilities for implementation of the plan, will be included in \nthe bidding documents and in the ensuing contracts. The contractors will be required to prepare \nsite-specific  EMPs  before  commencing  construction.  The  initial  environmental  examination  will \nbe updated during the detailed design of the project. \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  in  the  Safeguard \n36. \nPolicy  Statement  in  the  project  area,  and  the  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 \n\nRisks \nDelayed procurement of detailed \ndesign may affect timeliness of \nprocurement of civil works. \n\nSafeguards complaints may delay \nprogress in project implementation. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nDetailed  design  and  procurement  documentation  is  being \nprepared  under  separate  financing,  and  will  be  completed  by \nNovember  2017.  Procurement  of  supervision  consultant  will \ncommence \nin  March  2017.  Procurement  of  civil  works \ncontractors  will  commence  in  July  2017.  When  the  project \nbecomes effective, the supervision contract will be ready to be \nawarded.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  shortly  after. \nAdvanced contracting action is to be taken for consultants and \ncivil works. \nExtensive  and  effective  consultations  with  nongovernment \norganizations  and  local  residents  were  conducted  during \nproject  preparation,  and  will  be  continued  during  the  detailed \ndesign  process  and  project  implementation.  A  grievance \nredress mechanism will be established once the final updated \nLARP  is  available  following  the  completion  of  the  detailed \ndesign process. \n\n                                                \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nAn inadequate road maintenance \nbudget may jeopardize the \nsustainability of large investments in \nthe road network, and preservation of \nroad assets.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nApart  from  the  joint  policy  dialogue  by  development  partners \nto increase the fiscal budget for road maintenance, efforts are \nalso  being  exerted  to  (i)  reduce  the  maintenance  backlog, \nparticularly  for  secondary  roads,  and  thereby  use  limited \nmaintenance  resources  more  productively;  and  (ii)  introduce \nPBM  contracts  to  spend  limited  road  maintenance  resources \nmore efficiently. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  LARP  =  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  PBM  =  performance-based \nmaintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n38. \nThe government and the MRDI have assured ADB that implementation of the project will \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\n39. \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n\n40.  With respect to land acquisition and resettlement, the government and ADB have agreed \nthat  no  civil  works  contract  will  be  awarded  until  not  less  than  50%  of  all  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement required for that contract, based on land area as set out in the project\u2019s approved \nLARP, have been completed, and all project-affected people in this part of the LARP have been \ncompensated  in accordance  with the  provisions of  the  LARP. This  condition  is reflected  in  the \nproject\u2019s loan agreement. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n41. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$80,000,000  to  Georgia  for  the  Secondary  Road  Improvement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  13  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n8 March 2017 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nIncreased  economic  activity  in  the  Kharagauli  municipality  and  surrounding  regions  and  national  connectivity \n\u201cSocioeconomic Development Strategy of Georgia (Georgia 2020)\u201d.a \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nImproved efficiency \nand increased \nmobility and \naccessibility of the \nresidents of the \nKharagauli \nmunicipality and \ntourists visiting the \nproject area \n\nOutput \nDzirula\u2013Chumateleti \nroad section improved \nand open to traffic \n\n \n\n \n\nBy 2022: \na.
