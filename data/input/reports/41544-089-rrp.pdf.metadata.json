Private \nconsumption remained stable at 94.7% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with 95.0% \nin 2014, and capital investment declined from 32.5% of GDP in 2014 to 27.8% in 2015 because \nof lower remittances and currency depreciation. With GDP growth expected to contract by 1.2% \nin the Russian Federation4 and 2.0% in Kazakhstan5 in 2016, growth in the Kyrgyz economy is \nprojected  to slow  to  1.0%  in 2016. The  challenging  external  environment  and fiscal  and social \npressures pose significant downside risks. Accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) in \n2015 also brings risks to the country\u2019s competitiveness in trading with non-EEU countries.6 \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  economy  depends  heavily  on  natural  resource  exploitation7 and  migration-\n3. \nled  remittances.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  diversifying  the  economy,  the  government \nidentified  the  promotion  of  the  private  sector  as  a  key  priority  under  its  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Strategy,  2013\u20132017. 8  The  strategy  aims  to  (i)  improve  the  environment  for \ndomestic  and  foreign  investment  to  increase  domestic  productivity,  (ii)  increase  transparency \nand efficiency of the public sector, and (iii) create higher-value jobs for the country\u2019s workforce. \n\n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The proposed subprogram 2 is included in ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Kyrgyz Republic, 2016\u2013\n2018. Manila. Subprogram 1 of the Second Investment Climate Improvement Program was approved in June 2015 \n(ADB.  2015.

Manila). \n\n3  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  significant  exposure  to  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan  through  trade, \nremittances, and investment channels. Remittances contracted 25% in 2015 but still  accounted for about 26% of \nKyrgyz\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \n\n4   World  Bank.  2016.

While EEU membership may increase trade in goods and services, \nfacilitate more efficient labor and capital flows, and reduce nontariff barriers, the required tariff increase to the level \nof the EEU common external tariff may deter trade with non-EEU countries. \n\n7  For example, gold constitutes about 48% of exports. The Kumtor Gold Company alone accounted for about 7.1% \n\nof GDP in 2015. \n\n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, National Council for Sustainable Development of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013. \n\nNational Sustainable Development Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic For the Period of 2013\u20132017. Bishkek. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSince 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with the government \n4. \nto  improve  the  investment  climate  and  supporting  private  sector  development. 9  Additional \nsupport is needed to (i) expand access to financial services, (ii) improve physical infrastructure \nand  services,  (iii)  align  workforce  skills  with  market  needs,  and  (iv)  reduce  corruption  and  the \ncost of doing business.10 \n \n5. \nInadequate access to financial services. Banks dominate the Kyrgyz financial system, \nrepresenting  87.4%  of  finance  sector  assets.  While  the  depth  of  the  financial  system11 has \nimproved\u2014the share of loans to GDP rose from 12.4% in 2011 to 27.1% on 30 June 2015\u2014it \nremains  shallow  compared  with  regional  peers. 12  The  access  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  to  suitable  products  and  services  is  constrained  by  high  bank  lending \ninterest  rates  (18.6%  as  of  December  2015)  and  excessive  collateral  requirements  (150%\u2013\n200%  of  the  loan  amount).  This  results  in  banking  services  being  concentrated  on  larger \ncompanies.  Without  adequate  payment  infrastructure  (including  mobile  banking),  especially  in \nrural areas, the economy remains heavily cash-based. Despite improvements, cash still is used \nin  40%  of  transactions.  The  financial  intermediation  of  banks  can  be  increased  significantly. \nMost financial flows, including remittances, can be routed through the banking system, thereby \nincreasing funding opportunities for the private economy. Improving lending processes (focusing \non  cash  flows  rather  than  collateral),  strengthening  payment  systems,  and  improving  financial \nliteracy  can  help  broaden  private  access  to  finance.  Mobile  financial  services,  backed  by  a \nsound  regulatory  framework  for  an  e-economy,  can  lower  the  cost  of  financial  intermediation \nand  offer  opportunities  to  expand  the  outreach  to  (i)  new  customers,  especially  those  in  rural \nareas; and (ii) women and marginalized groups to engage in productive economic activities.13 \n \nHigh  infrastructure  and  service  needs.  Continuing  budget  deficits  have  constrained \n6. \nthe  government\u2019s  ability  to  invest  in  critical  infrastructure  necessary  for  private  sector  activity. \nInvestments  and  technical  competencies  are  needed  to  provide  better  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure  and  services  (including  for  trade  diversification).  A  sound  policy  and  regulatory \nframework,  dedicated  financing  for  infrastructure  project  preparation  advisory  services  and \nstructuring,  and  improved  knowledge and technical  capacity  of key government  ministries and \nagencies  will  help  prepare  bankable  projects  and  facilitate  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \ntransactions  that  benefit  from  the  expertise  and  incentives  of  private  entities.  To  build  an \neffective PPP program, the government needs to improve its ability to plan, regulate, execute, \nand  oversee  PPP  investments.  It  also  must  increase  private  investor  confidence  through  well-\ndesigned  contracts,  properly  allocating  risk  and  reward  incentives  for  investors  and  executing \ndemonstration projects.14 Given the early stage of PPP market development in the country and \nthe  absence  of  long-term  finance,  government  support  through  risk  participation,  debt,  and \nguarantee instruments is likely required to ensure the viability and affordability of PPP projects. \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. \n\nRepublic: \n\nInvestment \nhttp://www.adb.org/projects/41544-022/main#project-documents; and footnote 2. \n\nImprovement \n\nClimate \n\nKyrgyz \n\nProgram \n\n(Subprogram \n\n1). \n\n10 Sector Assessment (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Financial system depth means the increased provision of financial services for the economy. \n12 National  Bank  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  2015.

Achievements  include  the  PPP law  and  regulations  assigning  roles \nfor  the  Ministry  of  Economy  (coordination),  Ministry  of  Finance  (risk  management),  and  line  ministries  (project \ninitiation  and  development);  and  the  establishment  of  the  Project  Development  Support  Facility  for  project \npreparation advisory and structuring. The TA supports output 2 of the second program.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nExperience  in  countries  with  well-developed  PPP  markets  indicates  that  at  least  5  years  are \nrequired to reach contract awards for the first PPP projects. \n \nTrade  and  investment  diversification.  Although  the  government\u2019s  trade  and  FDI 15 \n7. \npolicies support market openness, as shown by the improvement in the trade-to-GDP ratio from \n95%  (2005)  to  133%  (2015),  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  exports  mainly  gold  and  other  minerals, \ntextiles, and agriculture products. Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, the United \nArab  Emirates,  and  Uzbekistan  absorbed  more  than  80%  of  the  value  of  these  exports  in \n2014.16 In  addition,  EEU  accession  has  increased  the  country\u2019s  exposure  to  this  economically \nvolatile region, making trade diversification necessary. FDI is focused on a few capital-intensive \ninvestments in mining and energy, with minimal technology and skills transfer or links with the \nlocal  economy. 17  A  transparent  investor  grievance  and  dispute  resolution  mechanism  will \nprovide out-of-court settlement of investment disputes and avoid protracted and costly litigation \nand renegotiation of contracts.18  \n \n8. \nIndustry\u2013labor  market  skills  mismatch. The curricula of the technical and vocational \neducation  and  training  (TVET)  systems  need  to  be  recalibrated  to  meet  the  needs  of  private \nenterprises.  While  industry  sector  skills  councils  have  been  established,  private  company \nrepresentation is missing. As a result, TVET offerings are essentially driven by student demand, \nrather than by potential employer requirements. The Kyrgyz International Business Council has \nsingled  out  the  lack  of  qualified  workers  as  a  key  hurdle  to  attracting  foreign  investment. \nEquipping  the  labor  force  with  skills  demanded  by  the  private  sector  will  help  increase  the \ngrowth and productivity of the economy, enhance opportunities for investments in human capital, \nand reduce income inequality. \n \n9. \nWeak  governance  and  high  cost  of  doing  business.  Corruption  remains  a  key \nobstacle  for  doing  business.  Regulatory  and  legal  reforms  are  needed  to  ease  the  barriers  to \nformalizing  businesses,  reduce  arbitrary  discretion  of  officials,  and  improve  accountability  of \nlicensing  and  inspection  bodies.  E-procurement  in  the  public  sector  will  help  limit  discretion \n(reducing  the  likelihood  of  petty  corruption)  and  enhance  transparency,  accountability,  and \nefficiency in service delivery. It will also create business opportunities for the private provision of \npublic services. Simplifying regulations and reducing compliance costs, including taxes, will give \nunregistered firms incentives to register and pay taxes. \n \n10.  While  investment  and  funding  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Russian \nFederation  will  continue,  systematic  reforms  are  essential  to  increase  the  value  addition  of \nformal  SMEs  in  the  economy,  create  jobs,  and  reduce  the  Kyrgyz  economy\u2019s  dependence  on \nextractive industries and remittance-backed private consumption.19 \n\n                                                \n15 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2016. Investment Policy Review: Kyrgyzstan. Geneva. \n16 Gold accounts for more than 40% of the total value of exports of gold and other minerals, textiles, and agriculture \n\nproducts. Central Asia and the Russian Federation absorb about 80% of non-gold exports. \n\n17 In 2014, FDI was concentrated on exploration, mining, and manufacturing (79%), mainly from Canada, the Russian \n\nFederation, and the United Kingdom. \n\n18 The operating contract of the Kumtor gold mine is being renegotiated. \n19 SMEs in the Kyrgyz Republic are defined in terms of employees, turnover, and sector. In agriculture, hunting and \nforestry,  fishing,  fish  farming, mining, processing, construction,  and  production  and  distribution  of  electricity,  gas, \nand  water,  small  enterprises  have  16\u201350  employees  and  annual   turnover  of  Som150,000\u2013Som500,000,  while \nmedium-sized enterprises have 51\u2013200 employees and annual turnover of Som500,000\u2013Som2,000,000. In trade, \nmotor vehicle repairs, household goods and personal items, hotels and restaurants, transport and communication, \nfinance,  real  estate,  renting  and  consumer  services,  education,  health  care,  and  social  and  personal  services, \nsmall  enterprises  have  8\u201315  employees  and  annual  turnover  of  Som230,000\u2013Som500,000,  while  medium-sized \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernment  efforts  and  development  coordination.  To mitigate the risks of lending \n11. \nto  SMEs,  five  regional  public  credit  guarantee  funds  have  been  set  up,  which  had  leveraged \nSom172  million  by  an  aggregate  capital  of  Som32.5  million  as  of  2014.20 Warehouse  receipts \nfinancing is being piloted, and the Law on Warehouse Receipts is being drafted. To reduce the \nshare  of  cash  circulating  in  the  economy,  payments  through  banks  covered  90.5%  of  public \nsector  salaries  and  33.4%  of  pensions  in  2014.  Amendments  to  the  PPP  law,  and  improved \nproject development and transaction advisory and government financial support, have resulted \nin 14 projects at different stages of preparation\u2014with the first PPP contract award scheduled for \nmid-2017.21 In addition, the amended Law on Investment improves investor protection. \n \n12. \nSome  of  Kyrgyz\u2019s  development  partners  are  supporting  government  efforts  to  improve \nthe investment climate.22 The International Monetary Fund\u2019s extended credit facility, approved in \nApril  2015,  supports  fiscal  and  debt  sustainability  and  financial  sector  stability.23 The  World \nBank helps improve public financial accounting, disclosure, and audit. The International Finance \nCorporation  assists  in  improving  the  foreign  investment  policy  and  related  laws,  and \nagribusiness  regulations;  and  provides  PPP  transaction  advisory  services.  The  Swiss  State \nSecretariat for  Economic  Affairs  is  cofinancing  activities  of  the World Bank  Group. The  United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  helps  improve  the  competitiveness  of  textile, \ntourism, and construction sectors. The Japan International Cooperation Agency, European Bank \nfor  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD),  and  German  development  cooperation  through \nKfW and GIZ are supporting SME and private sector development and PPPs. \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  programmatic  approach  has  enabled  the  government  to \n13. \nbuild  systematically  on  achievements, \nlessons,  and  steer  a \ncomprehensive  reform  program.  ADB\u2019s  continuing  support  and  government  progress  made \nunder the program have triggered more ambitious reforms. For example, the government \n\nincorporate  appropriate \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nis gradually increasing cashless payments through the banks to (a) help reduce \nthe  size  of  the  informal  economy,  (b)  improve  financial  system  depth  by \nincreasing  deposits  in  the formal  financial  system,  (c)  provide  financial  services \nto the currently underbanked (mainly the poor and women), and (d) increase the \ntransparency of transactions; \ndeveloped its PPP policy, legal, institutional, and financial framework in line with \ninternational good practice, resulting in a pipeline of 14 projects, with one project \nexpecting the contract award by mid-2017;24 \nacquired  the  Generalised  System  of  Preferences  Plus  (GSP+)  trade  privilege \nfrom  the  European  Union  (EU)  to  diversify  exports,  which  resulted  in  Turkish \ncompany  Deniz  Tekstil  setting  up  a textiles  factory  near  Kara-Balta  to  export  to \nthe EU and the EEU;25 \nobtained  on  December  2015  its  first  sovereign  credit  rating  by  leading  rating \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nenterprises have 16\u201350 employees and annual turnover of Som500,000\u2013Som2,000,000.

All policy actions completed under subprogram 1 remain intact, and the \n21  subprogram  2  policy  actions  have  advanced  the  progress  made  under  subprogram  1. \nSubprogram 2 actions were completed in June 2016, well within schedule,30 despite elections in \n2015 and the formation of a new government. \n \nOutput 1: Access to finance increased. This output aims to increase access to finance \n18. \nby  reducing  the  costs  and  risks  of  lending  to  SMEs,  increasing  cashless  payments,  and \nincreasing the access of the underbanked (rural population, poor people, women, and those in \nthe informal sector) to the formal financial system. Subprogram 1 (i) prepared the concept for a \nrisk-sharing  facility  through  a  guarantee  fund  for  SMEs,  (ii)  established  enabling  laws  and \nregulations for electronic payments and mobile financial services, and (iii) prepared a strategic \nplan for retail payments including regulatory oversight. \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  (i)  implemented  a  risk  management  system, \n19. \ninternet payment systems, and a dispute resolution system for the Interbank Processing Center \n(IPC);  (ii)  approved  the  IPC  business  strategy,  2016\u20132018  and  built  the  requisite  IPC  staff \ncapabilities;  (iii)  put  in  force  regulations  for  e-money,  payment  systems  operators,  and  remote \ndelivery  of  other  financial  services;  (iv)  integrated  relevant  payment  cards  and  money  transfer \ncards; 31  (v)  launched  the  State  Program  on  Financial  Literacy;  and  (vi)  approved  the \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2012.

This output aims to enable \n20. \nprivate  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  investments  and  services  by  providing  well-\nstructured  and  bankable  PPPs  to  the  market.  It  will  gradually  build  operational  experience \nthrough  learning-by-doing  on  pilot  projects.33 Subprogram  1  strengthened  the  PPP  framework \nby  (i)  drafting  amendments  to  the  PPP  law;  (ii)  approving  funding  for  advisory  and  structuring \nsupport  from  the  Project  Development  Support  Facility  (PDSF),  established  in  2014  for  pilot \nprojects  (footnote  14);  and  (iii)  approving  guidelines  on  identifying  and  managing  PPP  fiscal \nrisks,  including  PPP  contingent  liabilities.  It  also  developed  a  PPP  manual,  which  included  a \nmodel  concession  agreement  and  set  out  policies  and  procedures  for  PPP  selection, \npreparation,  due  diligence  and approval, fiscal risk  identification  and management,  and tender \nproceedings. It also launched a communication plan to increase PPP public awareness. \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  (i)  began  structured  implementation  of  its  PPP \n21. \nprogram,  including  recruiting  and  training  PPP  staff  in  key  agencies;  (ii)  amended  PDSF \nregulations  to  streamline  its  steering  committee\u2019s  approval  process  for  funding  prefeasibility \nstudies, feasibility studies, and/or transaction advisory of projects; (iii) established a PPP council \nheaded by the vice prime minister to strengthen oversight of PPP implementation; (iv) undertook \nan  interministerial  review  of  the  health  and  transport  (road)  sectors,  and  approved  strategies \nand  multiyear  public  investment  plans  (up  to  2025),  including  PPPs,  in  those  sectors;  (v) \napproved  PDSF  funding  for  five  projects  and  announced  competitive  tenders  for  related \nprefeasibility  and  feasibility  studies;  (vi)  signed  the  feasibility  study  and  transaction  advisory \ncontract  for  a  CT  scan  project;  (vii)  drafted  the  mechanism  and  guidelines  for  long-term  debt \nfinancing  of  PPP  projects;  and  (viii)  amended  the  draft  budget  code  to  include  government \nfinancial support for PPP projects. The Parliament amended the PPP law. \n \n22. \nOutput 3: Trade and investment diversified. This output aims to implement the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s trade and investment policies, including the priorities set out in the EDP, 2015\u20132017 \nand  capitalizing  on  the  export  opportunities  provided  by  EEU  membership  and  the  GSP+ \nprivileges (footnote 25). Since trade and investment facilitation also covers services, this output \nprovides  for  the  identification  of  and  information  on  new  markets  for  Kyrgyz  exporters  and \nopportunities  for  prospective  foreign  investors,  including  addressing  investors\u2019  grievances  and \ndeveloping  workers\u2019  skills  in  line  with  market  demand.  Subprogram  1  helped  the  country  (i) \napply for GSP+ status and prepare for its first sovereign credit rating, (ii) implement the strategy \nof  the  Investment  Promotion  Agency  (IPA),  (iii)  draft  a  strategy  for  modernizing  the  national \nquality  infrastructure  (NQI)  for  trade  in  line  with  international  requirements,  and  (iv)  establish \nindustry\u2013TVET coordination for skills development. \n \n23. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  (i)  established  the  EDP  secretariat  and \nimplemented  the  strategy  implementation  management  tool,  a  web-based  interface  to support \nall the functions required to effectively manage EDP implementation;34 (ii) obtained GSP+ trade \n\n                                                \n32 The EDP, 2015\u20132017 lays out specific courses of action to develop the country\u2019s export sector. It  also takes into \n\naccount the implications for the Kyrgyz Republic joining the EEU. \n\n33 Pilot projects are being developed in health, medico services, roads, tourism, and urban transport.  \n34 The  International  Trade  Centre\u2014the  joint  agency  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  and  the  United  Nations\u2014is \n\nproviding support. http://www.intracen.org/itc/about/#sthash.HKp7OEqa.dpuf \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nstatus; (iii) prepared an action plan to identify trade diversification opportunities under GSP+;35 \n(iv) streamlined export and investment facilitation under  the IPA; (v) approved the Strategy for \nthe Modernization of NQI (incorporating EEU quality standards);36 (vi) approved a resolution to \nestablish an investor grievance redress mechanism under the IPA; (vii) compiled a database of \nexisting and new investors grievances, and drafted the process for addressing such grievances; \n(viii) obtained the country\u2019s first sovereign credit rating (para. 13); and (ix) introduced industry-\nreviewed TVET curricula in select institutes. \n \nOutput 4: Transparency and ease of doing business increased. This output aims to \n24. \nincrease transparency in government and reduce the  regulatory and tax-related costs of doing \nbusiness to give private businesses incentives to expand and formalize, including formalization \nof  businesses  in  the  informal  sector,  many  of  which  are  owned  by  women.  Subprogram  1 \nsupported  the  rollout  of  e-procurement  in  all  government  agencies,  as  well  as  the  approval  of \nlegal  amendments  to  reduce  the  tax  filing  frequency  for  SMEs.  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment  (i)  issued  the  regulation  on  e-procurement  system  maintenance,  assigning \nresponsibilities  to  relevant  government  agencies;  (ii)  allocated  a  budget  for  the  e-procurement \nsystem  effective  1  April  2016  (to  ensure  continuity  after  the  completion  of  an  ADB\u2019s  technical \nassistance  project);37 (iii)  increased  the  limit  for  business  turnover  exemption  from  the  value-\nadded tax; (iv) waived sales tax on exports and on all noncash payments; and (v) reduced tax \ncompliance costs by reducing tax collection from three agencies to one, the State Tax Service. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n25. \nThe  overall  program  has  three  subprograms  and  an  estimated  funding  requirement \nequivalent  to  $70  million  for  2015\u20132018.  Subprogram  1  was  funded  by  a  grant  of  $20  million, \ndisbursed in 2015. Funding for subprogram 2 totals $25 million equivalent. The government has \nrequested  (i)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR8,890,000,  and  (ii)  a  grant  not \nexceeding  $12.5  million,  both  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the \nprogram.38 The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. Subprogram 2 funding will be disbursed in \na single tranche upon loan and grant effectiveness. \n \n26. \nThe size of subprogram 2 is based on the government\u2019s development financing needs, \nthe  nature  of  the  required  reforms,  and  the  fiscal  benefits  and  development  impact.  The \ndevelopment-related financing gap is about $299.4 million for 2016, an increase of 31.4% from \n2015.39 The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is projected at 4.9% of GDP in 2016 and 4.1% in 2017. The gap is to \nbe  met  mainly  from  long-term  loans  from  foreign  sources  (projected  at  $124.9  million)  and \nanticipated  budget  support  from  the  World  Bank ($24.0  million),  ADB  ($25.0  million), \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  ($26.0  million),  Russian  Federation  ($30.0  million),  and  EU  and \nother  development  partners  ($19.9  million).  The  remaining  gap  is  expected  to  be  met  from \nrevenues from proposed privatizations ($42.1 million) and issuance of government bonds ($7.5 \nmillion). ADB\u2019s subprogram 2 will help narrow the financing gap by about 8.3% in 2016. Public \nexternal  debt  surged  from  53%  of  GDP  in  2014  to  63%  of  GDP  during  2015  because  of  the \n\n                                                \n35 Priority export industries are agriculture (fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products), textile and apparel, tourism, \nconstruction materials, and bottled water. These industries also benefit from the zero or low tariffs of the GSP+. \n\n36 EU quality standards will be incorporated during the time frame of subprogram 3. \n37 ADB. 2012.

Because of the \nparliamentary elections in 2015, the government delayed \ufb01scal consolidation measures to 2016 \nto improve debt sustainability to an acceptable level by 2018, while continuing to fund programs \nto  reduce  poverty  and  boost  growth.  Budget  support  is  necessary  to  finance  part  of  the \ndevelopment  financing  needs,  covering  the  period  from  the  introduction  of  reforms  to  the \nrealization of fiscal benefits.40 \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n27. \nThe  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE)  is  the  executing  agency.  The  MOE,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF), and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic are the implementing agencies. \nThe  government  can  implement  the  reforms  effectively,  as  demonstrated  by  its  experience \nunder  the  first  program  and  the  effective  execution  of  policy-based  programs  with  other \ndevelopment partners, including the World Bank. Two technical assistance projects support the \nimplementation  of  subprogram  2.41 All  policy  actions  under  subprogram  2  were  completed  by \nthe implementing agencies in June 2016; the implementing agency responsible for completing a \nspecific  policy  action  will  be  indicated  in  the  financing  agreement.  Follow-up  actions  for \nsubprogram  3  are  being  firmed  up  (Appendix  4).  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  and \ngrant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as \namended from time to time). The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of \nitems, excluding items in the list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral  sources.42 Implementation  of  the  overall  program  is  expected  to  finish  by  October \n2018. Subprogram 1 was implemented from July 2014 to June 2015, while subprogram 2, which \nbegan implementation in July 2015, is expected to be completed in July 2016. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n28. \nThe  reforms  supported  by  the  program  entail  (i)  short-term  direct  and  indirect  costs  to \nthe  government  to  implement  and  monitor  reforms,  and  (ii)  fiscal  benefits  in  the  form  of \nincreased revenues from greater and diversified economic activities. Indirect costs are staff time \nand  administrative  expenses.  Direct  costs  include  the  costs  associated  with  establishing \nguarantee facilities and implementing pilot e-payments projects; required government funding to \nenable  private  participation  in  infrastructure,  including  NQI  for  trade,  infrastructure  project \ndevelopment,  and  advisory  services;  and  sovereign  ratings  reviews.  The  reforms  will  create  a \nbigger  formal  and  diversified  economy.  Key  cost  savings  and  long-term  gains  from  the  reform \nprogram will be (i) expanded access to credit for the private sector through guarantee facilities, \nas well as an increase in the volume of money and payments made in the banking system; (ii) \nincreased  financial  savings  and  efficiency  gains  from  improved  public  investment  planning, \nexecution, and leveraging of finance through private sources, including PPPs; (iii) more value-\nadded  jobs  through  effective  implementation  of  trade  and  investment  policies;  (iv)  greater \nformalization of the economy by easing of registration, tax compliance, and tax administration; \n(v)  greater  investor  confidence  and  higher  investments;  and  (vi)  improved  cost  efficiency  from   \n\n                                                \n40 Program  Impact  and  Justification  of  Policy-Based  Lending  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n41 ADB. 2016.

Central Treasury  systems \nare being strengthened and fully automated: all regional treasury departments are connected to \nthe central system and the expenditure segments are fully automated. The World Bank\u2019s Kyrgyz \nAudit  and Financial  Reporting  Enhancement  Project  is  supporting  audit and financial  reporting \nreforms.  Under  the  grant  project  that  supported  the  first  program  (2008-2014),  the  MOE \napproved contracts which overcharged for the delivery of training components. ADB is working \nwith the Government and the MOE to mitigate risks of similar recurrences, and to recover these \nfunds.44 Public procurement policy has been improved with support from EBRD and the United \nNations  Commission  on  International  Trade  Law.  Through  ADB  support,  a  modern  e-\nprocurement  system  is  being  mainstreamed  across  all  central  government  agencies  (footnote \n37). Streamlined tax regulations, lower tax rates, and the automation of tax filing (with support \nunder  output  4)  are  reducing  the  cost  of  compliance  and  rent-seeking  opportunities  of  tax \ncollection officials. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is helping the \nreforms. 45  ADB\u2019s \ngovernment  monitor \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and MOE. \n \nC. \n\nthe  progress  and  efficiency \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nin  anticorruption \n\n30. \nBetter access to finance, diversified trade and investment, improved public infrastructure, \nand reduced costs of doing business will stimulate private sector activity. New enterprises and \ngrowth  of  and  innovation  in  existing  ones,  will  create  more  and  higher  value-added  jobs. \nImproved public infrastructure and services will directly benefit the poor and vulnerable, as will \nthe  expansion  of  mobile  and  e-payments.  Subprogram  2,  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming,  will  address  the  insufficient  representation  of  women  in  economic  policy \ndevelopment  and  implementation,  and  unequal access  to  assets  and resources.  SMEs  owned \nby women will be supported by the guarantee fund and will be provided with dedicated business \ndevelopment  support  to  capitalize  on  the  EEU  and  GSP+  export  opportunities.  Key \nimplementing  agencies under  the  program,  including the  MOE  and  MOF,  are  hiring  women to \nensure  appropriate gender  balance  in key  technical  positions.  Infrastructure  PPP  projects  with \npositive poverty and gender impacts are being prioritized, and the design of infrastructure PPP \nprojects  will  consider  solutions  that  positively  impact  poverty  and  gender.  The  market-linked \nTVET programs will aim to provide 25% of the jobs and internships to women. Reducing taxes \nand  tax  compliance  requirements  will  encourage  unregistered  businesses,  many  of  which  are \nowned by women, to enter the formal economy. \n \n\n                                                \n43 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44 ADB. 2013.

None of the activities \nwill  require  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  The  program  is  unlikely  to \nhave  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment.  Safeguards  categorization  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nThe economy faces substantial downward risks to investments, remittances, and exports \nbecause of the slowdown of its major trading partners in Central Asia. These risks are mitigated \nby  the  country\u2019s  acquisition  of  the  EU\u2019s  GSP+.  The  MOF  is  developing  the  treasury  single \naccount system and plans to launch the pilot by  December 2016. It is also in discussions with \nthe Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency for a project in 2016 to develop the software \nfor financial management information system. The MOF is also working on bringing the treasury \nsystem  software  in  line  with  EEU  requirements.  Progress  will  continue to  be  monitored  during \nthe  preparation  of  subprogram  3.  Corruption  risks  are  being  mitigated  by  mainstreaming \ngovernment  e-procurement,  reducing  tax  compliance  burdens,  and  establishing  an  investor \ngrievance  redress  mechanism.  The  benefits  and  impacts  of  the  program  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs and mitigate risks. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \n33. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \nand grant documents. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n34. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR8,890,000  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Second  Investment  Climate  Improvement \nProgram,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \nfor a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nfinancing  agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe grant not exceeding $12,500,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources \nInvestment  Climate \nImprovement  Program,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft financing  agreement presented to the \nBoard.  \n\nfor  subprogram  2  of \n\nthe  Second \n\n \n\n \n8 July 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nIncreased private sector investment in the economya \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets and \nBaselines \na.
