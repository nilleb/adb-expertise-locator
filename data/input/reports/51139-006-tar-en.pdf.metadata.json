The proposed technical assistance (TA) subproject is part of the approved transaction TA \ncluster1 designed to complement the approved loan2 of up to $100,000,000 to Olam International \nLimited (OIL) and two of its subsidiaries. The loan is supporting the $223,000,000 capex and \nexpansion plan of OIL and its subsidiaries (Olam) over the 2017-2019 period and invest in Olam\u2019s \nmidstream processing assets and permanent working capital for smallholder farmer supply in \nIndonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Viet Nam.3 The project will promote \ninclusive and sustainable agricultural value chains with higher local value addition in Southeast \nAsia and the Pacific. The TA subproject will complement the loan by providing capacity building \nsupport to 4,000 smallholder coffee farmers that Olam sources from in PNG.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n2.  The TA cluster was approved on 18 December 2017. Subproject 1 was approved on 18 \nDecember  2018  and  Subproject  2  was  approved  on  10 May  2018.  For  Subproject  1,  the \nrecruitment of the consulting firm is currently underway and the expected commencement date is \n15 February 2020. For Subproject 2, Landell Mills Limited was retained as the consultant. The \ncommencement date for Subproject 2 is 19 November 2018 and the project will be completed by \n14 May 2021. Subproject 3 is being processed and implementation is expected to begin in the \nsecond quarter of 2020.  \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n3.  The TA subproject will help smallholder coffee farmers in PNG fully benefit from their \ninclusion in the coffee value chain by improving the productivity and quality of crops, and meeting \ninternational certification standards. The subproject will also ensure that these farmers are better \nprepared to cope with the negative consequences of climate change. The scope of the TA \nsubproject will be limited to the activities of the TA cluster in PNG.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Impacts and outcome of the TA subproject are in line with the financing project. Impacts \nare: (i) double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through \ninputs, knowledge, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment, (ii) \nensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that \nincrease productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for \nadaptation to climate change, and (iii) significant increase in the exports of developing countries. \nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n5.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $750,000 of which $650,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6) and  $100,000,  for the \ncomponents related to climate change adaptation, will be financed by the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and \nadministered by ADB.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n6.  ADB will administer the TA subproject from October 2020 to March 2023. Olam will be the \nrecipient of the TA subproject as Olam is best positioned to coordinate the work of the consulting \nfirms and share learning with farmers, the government, and other stakeholders in the project \ncountries. Because of Olam sources from the smallholder farmers directly or through local buying \nagents, the company has a relationship with farmers and will ensure that they fully benefit from \nthe TA subproject. The interests of Olam and the farmers are aligned in relation to the TA \nsubproject outcome, since if smallholder coffee farmers grow more, at a better quality, Olam \n ", "3 \ncontinues to satisfy customer demand for high-quality, sustainable products. Olam has the \nfinancial  and  administrative  capacity  to  provide  the  required  in-kind  contributions  to  the \nconsultants and ensure successful implementation of the TA subproject.  \n \n7.  Olam  and  ADB  have  agreed  to the  terms of a  draft  TA  subproject  implementation \nagreement. The draft agreement sets out the outcome and outputs of the TA subproject, the \namount of financing to be provided by ADB, the terms of reference of the consulting firm to be \nappointed, the proposed budget, and a realistic implementation timetable. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  October 2020\u2013March 2023 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  Olam \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm:  Inclusive and Climate  Quality and Cost- $750,000 \nResilient Coffee Value Chain           Based Selection \n Subproject 4: Papua New Guinea \nEquipment  The consulting firms will be in charge of procuring the equipmenta required for the TA  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).

The vast majority of coffee produced in \nPNG is grown by smallholders on farms averaging one hectare whose livelihoods depend on a \nsuccessful coffee crop. In PNG, the quality and productivity of coffee has been declining and \nsmallholder farmers\u2019 yields are 50-60% below their potential.7 Hence, improving productivity and \nprice realization can have a significant impact on household incomes. However, many smallholder \nproducers  are  constrained  by  gaps  in  knowledge  and  understanding  of  good  agricultural \npractices, limited financial inclusion, difficulties in accessing high quality inputs and technical \nadvice, poor transport links and market infrastructure, and continued dependence on middlemen.  \n \nClimate change is also a growing challenge and poses a serious threat to long term sustainability.  \nPNG is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the Pacific when measured by \neconomic losses (as proportion of GDP), with losses from climate change expected to reach 15% \nof PNG\u2019s GDP by 2100.8 PNG is expected to experience a temperature increase of more than \n2.5\u00b0C on average by 2070. \n \nTA support to households will be anchored on a holistic climate-smart agriculture training program \nincluding  training  sessions,  field  trials,  and  demonstration  plots.  Productivity  and  quality \nimprovement, environmental sustainability of production, farmer organization, and household \nfinancial management will be key focus areas, which will help build suppliers\u2019 understanding of \nand adherence to the Olam Supplier Code.9 The TA will help to establish local level farmer \nmanaged demonstration plots to clearly demonstrate the impact of specific farm management \npractices.  These  demonstration  plots  will  form  part  of  a  broader  network  of  farm  level \ndemonstration plots that is envisaged under PNG\u2019s coffee sector development plan. They would \nbe comparable to the farmer demonstration plots that have been established by World Coffee \nResearch and aligned with the frameworks and principles that have been established by the \nGovernment of PNG and relevant industry stakeholders.  \n \nTA support to smallholders will be organized and monitored using the Olam farmer management \ninformation system (OFIS), an innovative mobile technology platform that is being developed by \nOlam. This will facilitate initial baseline data collection on household and farm characteristics, \nongoing recording of training and extension activities, periodic surveys of farm conditions to track \nchanges  over  time,  the  development  of  personalized  farm  management  plans,  and  the \nimplementation of farm and household level certifications. The deployment of OFIS will be a \nsignificant innovation for PNG and will facilitate rigorous monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n \n7  World Bank. 2009.

The TA will \nsupport  evaluation  of  the  relative  effectiveness  of  different  training  approaches  and \nmethodologies by using data collected through OFIS to compare the costs and benefits of two or \nmore training \u2018treatments\u2019 that have been designed with inputs from relevant experts. The TA will \nalso include specific interventions to help the Government of PNG and other industry stakeholders \nto build a clear understanding of the technology and its broad capabilities, and to formally assess \nthe potential to apply OFIS or a similar system across the industry.  \n \nDelivery of TA-funded training and extension services will be closely coordinated with the Ministry \nof Agriculture to avoid duplication of efforts and support continued development of the public \nextension service. The knowledge and learning that is emerging from TA activities will also be \nregularly shared with other industry stakeholders. This will help to leverage the impact of TA \nactivities by facilitating information exchange between sector stakeholders and encouraging \nbroader uptake of successful approaches.  \n \nThe TA will also encourage institution building and establishment of industry standards in PNG \nthrough the development of coffee grading systems and unified information management system. \nThe TA is a piggyback TA which will help realize the projected impact of the financing project. \nThe TA will help farmers be included in the global coffee supply chain by helping them adopt \nsustainable farming practices and increasing their production and quality, and ultimately, income. \nA.  Scope of Service \n \nThe project will be designed around the registration of 4,000 new farmers into the Olam Farmer \nInformation System (OFIS). This requires building on-the-gournd relationships with farmers and \ncollecting data through a baseline and annual surveys. Information collected should be used to \ndesign training programs including Good Agricultural Practices, Integrated Pest Management, \nand Climate Smart Agriculture. The setting up and running of a series of coffee demo plots will \nprovide accurate information on local coffee growing conditions, thus informing training content \nand providing training sites for farmers.  \n \nFarm level demonstration plots will be broadly modelled a World Coffee Research methodology \nbeing used locally, with the following characteristics:  \n(i)  Located on individual farmers\u2019 land and broadly representative of size / growing \nconditions faced by other farmers in the immediate vicinity;  \n(ii)  Managed according to a design that is centrally coordinated and that involves \n\u2018side-by-side\u2019 application of different treatments / practices.  \n(iii)  Supported by careful data collection and monitoring to enable clear evaluation of \nthe economic returns of different \u2018improvements\u2019 or changes in farming practices.  \n(iv)  Providing  clear  visual  evidence  to  nearby  farmers,  and  micro-data  for  more \naggregated analysis.  \n \nOFIS will be used to generate individual farm management plans and the project will supply inputs \nand advice to implement these effectively. Improvements in productivity, coffee quality and farmer \nlivelihoods are key measures of success. (Organic) certification and/or OLC certification may be \nuseful tools for delivering/measuring these.  \n \nThe firm will report to the ADB project officer through the assignment team leader and will perform \nthe following: \n \n1.
