An environmental impact assessment was undertaken and \na summary was circulated to the Board on 30 June 2005.* \n \nIn  2005,  the  Government  approved  a  Medium-Term  Development \nFramework 2005\u20132010 (MTDF) targeting key infrastructure subsectors.  \nRoads,  railway  systems,  ports  and  airports  are  some  of  the  priorities. \nThis  framework  itself  is  embedded  in  individual  subsector  roadmaps \nand is therefore a means to articulate a longer term strategic endeavor \nin  the  selected  areas.  The  Investment  Program  under  the  framework \nwill  help  modernize  existing  facilities  but  also  add  new  assets.  The \noutcome  will  be  greater  and  better  connectivity  within  and  across  the \ncountry\u2019s  principal  economic  centers  and  into  neighboring  countries. \nThis will pave the way for greater and better logistics, which in turn will \nimprove  access \ntrade  and \ncompetitiveness.    Better  logistics  will  also  cut  the  final  cost  of  goods \nand services.  \n \nRoad  transport  is  the  dominant  mode  for  freight  in  Pakistan  and  the \ndevelopment/upgrading  of  national  highway  network  features  as  a  top \npriority  within  the  MTDF  and  the  longer  term  framework.  The  MTDF \nsets  out  key  projects  to  begin  during  2005/2010;  in  some  instances \nprojects  will  be  completed  during  the  subsequent  5  years  ending \n2014/15.  The  projected  capital  outlays  from  the  National  Highway \nAuthority (NHA) over the next 10 years runs into PRs138.5 billion ($2.3 \nbillion). The MTDF program itself costs much more than that (PRs268.2 \nbillion  or  $4.5  billion).  This  implies  the  need  for  mobilizing  additional \ndomestic  and  international  resources.    The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) is one of the financing sources being tapped by the authorities.  \nOthers  include  the  private  sector  through  the  structuring  of  various \ninvestments  under  the  modality  of  Private  Public  Initiatives  (PPIs), \ncommercial banks and other multilateral and bilateral agencies.  \n \nThe  MTDF  has  been  converted  by  NHA  into  a  National  Highway \nDevelopment  Plan  (NHDP).  This \nimmediate  priority \ninvestment  and  noninvestment  interventions  needed  to  overcome \ncritical bottlenecks in the national highway network. To help meet these \nfinancing requirements, ADB has been requested to provide assistance \nthrough a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \n \nThe multitranche modality is the most appropriate in this instance.  The \nGovernment has a well-defined investment program, a roadmap and a \ndiversity  of  project  development  structures  (including  PPIs)  and  the \nneed for co-financing.  The long term nature of the investment program \nand the variety of subprojects requires a flexible facility that combines \n\nfocuses  on \n\n \n*   The summary EIA was circulated with title PAK: Proposed Subregional Transport Connectivity (Pakistan) Sector \n\nProject.  \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nInvestment  Program \n\nincludes  noninvestment \n\nfinancing with reforms and adherence to ADB and Government guiding \nprinciples in the areas of safeguards, fiduciary oversight, procurement, \ndisbursement, administration, monitoring, evaluation and reporting.       \n \nThe Investment Program is structured into three batches of subprojects. \nThe  first  batch  comprises  three  sample  subprojects  totaling  376 \nkilometers (km); the second batch five subprojects totaling 460 km. The \nnumber  of  subprojects  under  the  third  batch  has  not  yet  been \ndetermined.  The nature of the subprojects is the same; the number will \ndiffer according to local conditions. All subprojects will comply with pre-\nagreed selection criteria. \n \nThe \ninterventions, \nespecially  in  the  area  of  capacity  building.    This  support  will  focus  on \nplanning  and  design;  management  oversight \nfor  construction \nschedules, procurement, safeguards, and fiduciary arrangements.  The \nwork  will  also  cover  policy  reform.    The  sector  roadmap  provides  for \npublic  policy  changes  during  the  investment  program.  The  proposed \nassistance will target such policy changes as they fall due, in essence \nto enhance the viability and credibility of the Investment Program.  \n \nAn  MFF  amounting  to  $770  million.  This  financing  represents  33%  of \nthe total financing plan envisaged under the NHDP.  The ADB funding \ncovers  investment  and  noninvestment  interventions.  The  MFF  has  a \nmaximum  utilization  period  of  10  years.  Individual  periodic  financing \nrequests (PFRs) will be converted into individual or separate loans. The \nGovernment  and  NHA  have  entered  into  a  Framework  Financing \nAgreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements  set \nforth  in  Appendix  4  of  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities. \nPursuant  to  the  FFA,  the  Government  has  submitted  to  ADB  the  first \nPFR  in  the  amount  of  $180  million.  The  first  PFR  is  presented  to  the \nBoard, together with the FFA. Prior to ADB acceptance of a PFR, ADB \nwill ensure that the Government and NHA comply in full with the terms \nand  conditions  of  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement.    ADB  teams \nwill  conduct  due  diligence  on  these  to  ensure  that  they  are  being \nsatisfactorily adhered to. The minimum PFR or loan request at any one \ntime will not be less than $100 million. \n \nEfficient transport systems and networks contribute to economic growth \nand  prosperity.  Investment  and  noninvestment  interventions  in  this \nnetwork ultimately help tackle poverty. This approach and prioritization \nis  embodied  in  the  Country  Strategy  Program  (CSP),  the  platform  for \nADB operations (public and private).  The package of assistance from \nADB targets institutional and capacity building. The latter is important in \nterms of defining and executing policy reform, but also better strategic \nthe \nthinking \nmaintenance  and  upkeep  of  the  new  assets  created  out  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  support  envisaged  will  also  ensure  a \ncompetitive or \u201clevel playing field\u201d for the procurement and provision of \ngoods, civil works and related services. Institutional reforms will enable \nNHA perform its strategic planning and management role, while setting \nthe  scene  for  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector.  The  latter  will  be \ninvited  to  take  part  in  strategic  parts  of  the  network  \u2013  both  as  an \ninvestor  and  operator.    The  investment  in  the  highway  network  will \nrespond  to  increasing  traffic  and  address  poor  road  conditions  in \n\nthe  sector  and  planning,  and  oversight  over \n\nfor \n\n \nMultitranche \nFinancing \nFacility \n\n \nRationale \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nvarious parts of the country.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  improve  existing  road  network  assets, \ncreate  new ones  and  advance  policy  reform.    The  latter  will  create  an \nenabling environment for private sector participation in the system. The \nmain  reforms  are  summarized  in  the  Road  Sector  Development \nFramework. This framework has been endorse by NHA and will trigger \nfuture lending by ADB to Pakistan\u2019s national highway subsector.  \n \nThe Investment Program will deliver on two basic objectives. The first is \nimprovement in transport efficiency by (i) adopting a national transport \npolicy,  (ii)  strengthening  NHA  performance  in  managing  the  national \nhighway  network,  (iii)  improving  road  safety,  and  (iv)  improving  road \nmaintenance  and  funding.  The  second  objective  is  to  increase  private \nsector  participation  in  road  subsector  investments  by  (i)  increasing \noutsourcing  of  road  works,  and  (ii)  establishing  operations  jointly  with \nNHA. \n \nTo  realize  these  objectives,  the  Investment  Program  will  consist  of \nnational  highway  network  investment  and  institutional  strengthening  of \nNHA. \n \nThe  NHDP  amounts  to  $2.3  billion,  of  which  the  Investment  Program \ncomprising \nimplemented  amount \napproximately to $966.8 million equivalent. \n \n\nthree  batches \n\nto  be \n\nfirst \n\nthe \n\nSource \n\n \nADB, Ordinary Capital Resources \nADB, Special Funds Resources  \nGovernment  \n\nTotal Investment Program \n\nGovernment and other agencies \n\nTotal \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n($ million)\n\nTotal  Percent \n\n \n770.0 \n3.0 \n193.8 \n966.8 \n1,341.5 \n2,308.3 \n\n \n33.4 \n0.1 \n8.4 \n \n58.1 \n100.0 \n\nAn  MFF  of  up  to  $770  million  or  its  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  will  be  made  available.  The  MFF  is  expected  to  be \ndrawn  down  in  five  separate  PFRs  during  the  2006  to  2011  period. \nFinal terms and conditions for PFR will be determined in the context of \neach request. Terms and conditions will be finalized at the time of the \nrelevant  PFR  release  and  will  follow  prevailing  ADB  policies.  In \ngeneral, the financing made available under each PFR is anticipated to \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  facility.  The  Government  has  the  option  to  choose  between \nloan. \neligible  currencies  and \nRepayment schedules can also be structured for the purposes of each \nPFR. \n \nIn addition, a loan of $3.0 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special \n\ninterest  margin  regime \n\nfor  each \n\n \nImpact and  \nOutcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing \nPlan  \n\n \n \nADB Financing  \nand Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n \n \nClosing Date for \nSubmission of PFRs \n \nEstimated \nInvestment Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices  \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nFunds resources.

The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk on each loan. \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \n30 June 2015 \n\nimplementation.  NHA  will  establish \n\n \nNational Highway Authority \n \nNHA  will  establish  an  investment  program  coordinating  committee, \nchaired  by  the  NHA  chairperson,  to  monitor  and  oversee  overall \ntwo \ninvestment  program \nmanagement  units,  one  for  implementation  of  the  national  highways \nimprovement  component  and  the  other  for  the  implementation  of \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  NHA.  The  implementation  of  each \nsubproject  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  managed  by  a \ndedicated team.  \n \nAll  civil  works  contract  packages  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  following  international  competitive \nbidding procedures.  \n \nThe  international  consultants  engaged  on  a  consulting  firm  basis  will \nbe  evaluated,  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures  and  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Individual  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \ndomestic consultants on other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \nBy  increasing  the  capacity  on  the  main  domestic  corridors  the \nInvestment  Program  will  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  road \nsubsector  network  and  contribute  to  transport  efficiency.  This  will \nimprove  the  returns  and  sustainability  of  existing  and  future  road \nassets  in  the  sector,  and  contribute  to  a  wide  range  of  economic \nactivities  that  depend  on  road  transport  services.  Improved  access  to \neconomic opportunities and services will tackle poverty reduction. The \nInvestment Program will  also serve regional transport connectivity and \ntrade, \n \nThe  quantified  economic  benefits  consist  of  savings  in  vehicle \noperating  costs  and  passenger  time.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  of  the  first  batch  three  sample  subprojects  is  between  16.5% \nand 37.8%. Beneficiaries will include (i) direct users of road transport, \nincluding owners/operators of trucks, passengers of the various vehicle \nthose  benefiting \ncategories, \n\nthe  Government;  (ii) \n\nlaborers,  and \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nindirectly  because  they  live  in  the  immediate  area  of  influence  of  the \nproject  improvements;  and  (iii)  those  in  the  immediate  influence  area \nemployed on project construction. \n \n \nThe major risks for the Investment Program are (i) slow progress in the \nrecruitment  of  consultants  for  construction  supervision  activities;  (ii) \nslow  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  agreed  policy  reforms, \nleading  to  less  than  intended  improvements  in  sector  performance; \nand  (iii)  slow  utilization  of  the  MFF  to  implement  the  NHDP  over  10 \nyears. NHA has prepared advance consultant recruitment documents, \nwhich  will  be  issued  to  the  short-listed  consulting  firms  before  Board \nconsideration  of  the  Investment  Program.  Local  procurement  experts \nhave been recruited to cope with the initial workload. The policy reform \nrisks have been mitigated in the project design in accordance with the \nagreed  Road  Sector  Development  Framework  with  milestones  to  be \nmet for future ADB involvement in the sector. \n \nThe  MFF  modality  is  new  to  ADB  and  Pakistan.  Thus  special \ninvestment program teams will be on standby to offer advice and guide \nNHA  on  specific  issues  and  problems  pertaining  to  terms  and \nconditions  for  the  use  of  the  MFF.  The  Government  and  NHA  are \nproviding  ADB  with  a  set  of  specific  \u201cwarranties  and  representations\u201d \non various fronts and will need real time support prior to making formal \nsubmission  of  individual  PFRs  under  the  MFF.  ADB  will  handle  this \nrequirement in two ways. Firstly, it will strengthen the human resources \nof  its  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  to  deliver  additional  capacity  in \nprocurement  and  safeguard  compliance  activities.  Secondly, \nheadquarters  staff  responsible  for  the  Investment  Program  will  utilize \ntime  savings  arising  out  of  the  elimination  of  repetitive  processing \ntasks, directing these resources toward the supervision and monitoring \nof the Investment Program. This is clearly one of the advantages of the \nMFF.  NHA  has  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  adhere  to  the \nframework facility understandings, but from time to time the parties in \nthe  field  will  require  special  assistance.  ADB  will  position  itself  to \nprovide  this.  Finally,  the  Investment  Program  is  accompanied  by  an \ninstitutional  and  capacity  building  component,  the  aim  of  which  is  to \nprovide practical and real time support to the executing agency for the \npurposes of selected implementation work.    \n \nThere  is  potentially  a  fiduciary  oversight  risk  associated  with  the \nthrough \nInvestment  Program.  However, \noversight  and  monitoring  arrangements  in  the  areas  of  procurement, \naccounting,  administration  and  reporting.  Financial  management, \nbetter  and \ninformation \ntransparent  budgeting,  management  and \nsystem  improvement,  and  strengthened  financial  planning  will  form \npart of this capacity-building endeavor. A longer term objective will be \nto leave in place, systems, people, and procedures that can outlive the \nInvestment  Program  itself.  The  Government  and  NHA  are  especially \nkeen on this approach and accordingly will work with ADB toward this \nendeavor. \n\nthis  will  be  addressed \n\n \nRisks and  \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) and loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the National \nHighway  Development  Sector  Investment  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for \nthe Investment Program is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nRoads \n\n2. \nTransport  contributes  about  10%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Road  transport  is  the \ndominant  mode,  accounting  for  91%  of  passenger  traffic  and  96%  of  freight  traffic.  Road \ntransport  services  are  largely  in  the  private  sector,  which  handles  about  95%  of  freight  traffic \nand is highly competitive. During the 1990s, the overall demand for road transport grew at 7\u20138% \nper  year,  compared  with  average  gross  domestic  product  growth  of  4\u20135%.  The  number  of \nregistered motor vehicles in 2004 was 2.94 million (20 per 1,000 population), with a further 3.01 \nmillion  motorcycles  and  rickshaws.  The  combined  fleet  is  growing  at  9%  annually.  The  total \nlength of the road network is some 250,000 kilometers (km), 60% is paved. \n  \n3. \nTraffic  using  the  national  highway  network,  comprising  about  8,320  km  of  national \nhighways  and  710  km  of  motorways,  is  largely  commercial:  75\u201380%  of  traffic.  The  main \ndomestic  artery  is  concentrated  along  the  1,760  km  Karachi\u2013Lahore\u2013Peshawar  (M9/N5) \ncorridor. This serves 80% of the urban population and carries over 55% of intercity traffic. The \ncorridor  also  links  Punjab  and  the  northern  parts  of  the  country  with  international  markets \nthrough the southern Karachi area ports, which account for 96% of all trade. About 60% of the \nport  traffic  moves  along  this  corridor.  Other  national  highways  include  N55  (Indus  Highway), \nN25,  N65,  N40,  N70,  and  N35  (Karakoram  Highway).  A  detailed  condition  survey  in  2001 \nindicated  that  50%  of  the  national  highway  network  was  in  poor  to  very  poor  condition.  Some \ndeteriorated sections are located on important interprovincial and subregional routes (N25, N50, \nand N70), connecting Pakistan with Afghanistan, and providing access to southern ports. \n \n4. \nThe  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications  is \nresponsible for  the  operation,  maintenance,  and  development  of  the  national  highway  system. \nNHA  is  an  autonomous  highway  agency  with  a  functional  structure  and  decentralized \nimplementation arrangements through regional provincial offices. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the World Bank have provided assistance1 (i) to reorganize and commercialize NHA, \nshifting  its  focus  to  that  of  a  network  operator  and  service  provider,  and  (ii)  to  strengthen \nfinancial management systems to improve governance. NHA has internal capacity constraints, \nsuch  as  limited  in-house  capability  in  strategic  planning,  project  and  asset  management,  and \nnetwork operation.  \n \n5. \n\nAn analysis of the road sector and NHA operations is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2001.

From  the  MTDF,  NHA  undertook  preparation  of  the  National  Highway \nDevelopment Plan (NHDP).2 \n \n7. \nWith passenger traffic growing annually at 12.64% and freight traffic at 6.13%, 439 billion \npassenger-km of passenger traffic and 198 billion tons-km  of freight traffic are expected to be \nhandled  by  roads  by  2010.  As  a  result,  the  NHDP  provides  for  the  improvement  and \nrehabilitation  of  about  6,500  km  of  existing  roads  and  construction  of  2,500  km  of  new  roads \n(Table 1). \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Planned Roads (2005\u20132010) \n(kilometers) \nImprovements\n\nDescription \n\nNo. \n\n \n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n\n \nNational Highways \nProvincial Roads \nSpecial Area Roads \nTotal\n\n \n\nNew \nConstruction \n\nTotal \n\n \n2,500.0 \n4,000.0 \n500.0 \n7,000.0 \n\n9,000.0\n10,600.0\n1,500.0\n21,100.0\n\n6,500.0\n6,600.0\n1,000.0\n14,100.0\n\nSource: Government of Pakistan. 2005.

Main  areas  for \nimprovement/upgrading  are  (i)  completion  of  the  Makran  Coastal  Road,  (ii)  Lyari  Expressway, \n(iii) Indus Highway Phase III, (iv) Gwadar\u2013Turbat\u2013Hoshab section, (v) World Bank financed N5 \nhighway improvement, (vi) Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh, (vii) Kuchlak\u2013Zhob, (viii) Karachi\u2013Hub\u2013Kakar, \nand (ix) Hub\u2013Uthal N25.  \n \n9. \nUsing the NHDP as the basis for undertaking the 10-year implementation plan, ending in \n2014/15,  the  Government  identified  (i)  public  sector  development  projects  totaling  PRs138.5 \nbillion  ($2.30  billion),  and  (ii)  private  sector  investment  projects  totaling  PRs30.8  billion  ($0.51 \nbillion).  Financing  for  public  sector  development  projects  is  forecast  to  be  sourced  from \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  for  a  total  estimated  amount  of  PRs89.7  billion  (65%);  the \nGovernment will provide approximately PRs48.8 billion (35%) using internal resources. Private \nsector investment projects will be financed by public-private partnership modalities (para. 14). A \nsummary  of  the  NHDP  in  terms  of  funding  requirements  is  given  in  Table  2  and  a  detailed \nsummary  of  public  sector  development  projects  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  investment  program \nsubprojects  are  selected  from  NHDP\u2019s  public  sector  development  projects.  Their  eligibility  for \nfunding  from  ADB  resources  will  be  subject  to  detailed  feasibility  studies  and  satisfactory \ncompliance with the project eligibility criteria.  \n\n                                                 \n2  The NHDP is reflected in the Government\u2019s MTDF 2005\u20132010, approved on 27 May 2005. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nTable 2: Summary of the National Highway Development Plan (2005/06\u20132009/10) \n(PRs million) \n\nItem \nPublic Sector Development Projects  \nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Projects \n\nTotal \n\n \nFunded by: \nMultilateral Agencies \nPublic-Private Partnerships \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nSource: National Highway Authority. \n\n \n\nPRs billion\n138.5\n30.8\n169.3\n\n \n \n\n89.7\n30.8\n48.8\n169.3\n\n$ million\n2,308.3\n513.3\n2,821.6\n \n \n1,495.0\n513.3\n813.3\n2,821.6\n\nThe National Highway Network \n\n3. \nThe  national  highway  network  requires  significant  upgrading  to  support  the  current \n10. \naccelerated  growth  of  the  national  economy  and  rapid  expansion  of  subregional  trade. \nSubstantially increased funding of NHA is projected under the MTDF. Work to date has focused \non  upgrading  the  Grand  Trunk  Route  N5  and  the  Indus  Highway  N55,  both  major  national \nnorth\u2013south routes, from a 2-lane single carriageway to either a 4-lane single or a 2-lane dual \ncarriageway.  Some  key  subregional  sections  of  the  national  highway  remain  as  single-lane \nroads,  often  in  deteriorated  condition  and  incompatible  with  use  by  through  traffic.  Other \nsections  require  urgent  double-laning  to  avoid  crippling  congestion.  Bypasses  are  required  for \nmany cities and towns that are totally unsuited to the passage of heavy vehicles typically used \nfor subregional traffic. \n \n11. \nPakistan  is  ideally  located  to  act  as  a  hub  for  subregional  transport  and  to  take \nadvantage of the subregion\u2019s rapidly improving political situation for the development of transit \nand cross-border trade and commerce. Pakistan\u2019s road corridors offer the shortest route to the \nsea  by  several  hundred  km  for  landlocked  Afghanistan,  Central  Asia,  Xinjiang  province  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic China, and parts of the Russian Federation. However, physical, institutional, \nand other constraints currently prevent Pakistan from taking full advantage of its location. The \npotential  for  increased  trade  through  improved  trade  facilitation,  rehabilitated  transport  links, \nefficient cross-border movements, and increased efficiency at ports is highly significant for the \nPakistan economy. In addition, under the transit trade agreement with Afghanistan, in place for \nmore than a decade, approximately 88% of Afghan exports pass through Pakistan, while 47% of \nAfghanistan\u2019s imports also pass through Pakistan. The proposed Investment Program provides \nPakistan  with  an  opportunity  to  play  a  catalytic  role  in  the  development  of  such  transport \ninitiatives,  thereby  enhancing  subregional  cooperation  in  addition  to  promoting  its  domestic \ndevelopment. \n \n12. \nThe  highways  to  be  improved  under  the  Investment  Program  have  local,  provincial, \nnational, and subregional importance. The north\u2013south corridors via the N25 and N65 connect \nSindh  and  Balochistan  provinces  and  are  key  subregional  routes  connecting  Pakistan  with \nAfghanistan  and  Central  Asia.  The  east\u2013west  corridors  via  the  N50  and  the  N70  connect \nBalochistan with  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  and  Punjab.  These  routes  are  primary \nsubregional  corridors  connecting  Afghanistan  and  Iran  with  Pakistan  and  India.  N50  is  part  of \nthe key future corridor between Xinjiang province of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the new \ndeep-water  port  of  Gwadar.  N80  will  be  a  future  alternative  route  to  the  Khyber  Pass  and \nprovide  the  Islamabad\u2013Kabul  link  with  the  shortest  distance  in  Afghanistan.  The  N35  section \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nforms the southern approach to the Karakoram Highway linking Pakistan and Xinjiang province, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, a corridor of rapidly increasing importance for trade and tourism.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \n13. \nSubregional  Competitiveness.  With  evident  political  goodwill  in  place  and  growing \npressure  from  consumers  in  the  subregion  for  improved  access  to  international  markets,  the \nstage  is  set  for  a  transformation  in  trading  patterns,  with  particularly  beneficial  prospects  for \nPakistan. Pakistan does however face strong competition from Iran for subregional trade. Iran \nhas  a  better  developed  highway  network,  a  more  efficient  trucking  industry,  and  better \nfunctioning  and  more  secure  ports  and  transit  routes.  It  is  also  actively  pursuing  cross-border \nand  transit  traffic  opportunities  with  Afghanistan.  All  of  the  logistics  chain  will  need  to  be \nimproved for Pakistan to increase its share of transit traffic. While Pakistan has the advantage of \nvery  low  road  freight  rates,  this  is  offset  by  inefficient  operation,  delays  to  shipments,  and \ndamage to goods in transit; overcoming them is a time-consuming process because of the large \nnumber of stakeholders involved. ADB, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \nand  World  Bank  have  supported  the  establishment  of  the  National  Trade  and  Transport \nFacilitation  Committee  to  accelerate  the  process.  This  committee  and  its  subcommittees  have \nmade  progress  on  (i)  developing  and  improving  the  goods  declaration  form  and  transport \nclearance  documents,  (ii)  developing  a  minimum  standard  of  professional  qualifications  and \nstandard training conditions for freight forwarders, and (iii) reviewing and improving various acts \nfor the carriage of goods (i.e., Road Act, Sea Act, Air Act, and Marine Insurance Act). \n \n14. \nPrivate Sector Participation. The Pakistan economy in recent years has continued to \nimprove and gross domestic product growth accelerated to 8.4% in 2005, the highest in the last \ntwo decades. To maintain the achieved economic growth on a sustained basis, the Government \nhas  placed  heavy  emphasis  on  investing  in  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  requirements.  The \nNHDP  identifies  projects  valued  at  approximately  PRs30.8  billion  for  public-private  sector \nfinancing.  However,  NHA  has  experienced  difficulties  in  attracting  private  sector  investments \nbecause of the lack of a legal framework for ensuring private sector transactions. Under ADB-\nfinanced  technical  assistance  (TA),3  NHA  is  receiving  assistance  in  preparing  the  necessary \ndocumentation and evaluation of proposals for private sector financing (para. 28) achievements \nunder  the  TA.  The  Government  has  identified  seven  projects  for  private  sector  opportunities \ncomprising  (i)  interchanges  and  flyovers,  (ii)  motorways  and  carriageways,  and  (iii)  tunnels \n(Appendix 4). \n \n15. \nRoad Safety. The fatality rate on Pakistan\u2019s road network remains among the highest in \nAsia.4  The  causes  are  high  speeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor  discipline  and \nenforcement  of  rules,  and  poor  condition  of  vehicles.  Road  safety  audits  are  not  conducted \nroutinely  for  new  and  improved  roads.  The  road  safety  problem  is  exacerbated  by  lack  of \nawareness  and  poor  knowledge  of  road  safety  matters  among  the  general  public  and  road \nusers. National and provincial efforts and coordination are not rigorous, and responsibilities and \naccountability  of  institutions  and  provincial  departments  are  not  clearly  delineated.  More \nintensive efforts in educating and training drivers, together with awareness building are required \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2004.

Manila (TA 4508, approved on 20 December for $150,000). \n\n4  Pakistan  had  18.69  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles  in  1992.  This  was  lower  than  in  Bangladesh  (85.58)  and  India \n(25.27), but higher than in Southeast Asia (5\u201315 per 10,000 vehicles), and far above the countries with the lowest \nnumber of fatalities such as the United Kingdom (1.60) and Japan (1.74).

Under the NWFP Road Development Sector and Subregional \nConnectivity Project,5 the National Highway and Motorway Police is about to commence a pilot \nproject  on  road  safety  for  sections  of  the  national  highway  in  NWFP.  Among  other  items,  the \npilot  project  will  address  organizational  and  staffing  arrangements  as  part  of  preparing  the \ntraining programs. Policy dialogue for the Investment Program will track the findings of this pilot \nstudy and incorporate its recommendations into NHA operations. \n \n16. \nRoad  Maintenance.  NHA  is  responsible  for  maintaining  approximately  8,320  km  of \nnational highways, which carry approximately 80% of the country\u2019s commercial traffic. Because \nthe national highway network is under tremendous strain, NHA established the dedicated Road \nAsset  Management  Directorate  to  oversee  maintenance  operations.  Despite  the  gap  in \nmaintenance needs and resources, NHA through its gradual increase in toll receipts, has been \nable  to  achieve  significant  progress  since  2002/03  by  increasing  the  quality  of  maintenance \nthrough periodic overlays, providing rigid pavement at places of rutting, replacing/rehabilitating \nold  bridges,  etc.  In  addition,  NHA  has  embarked  on  a  major  axle-overload  control  program \nthrough installation of weigh stations and other suitable measures to control the damage caused \nby overloaded trucks. As per the latest studies undertaken in 2005, NHA requires approximately \nPRs6.3  billion  ($106.0  million)  per  annum  to  maintain  the  national  highway  network.  Currently \napproximately  PRs4.0  billion  ($67.0  million)  is  received  annually  from  toll  receipts  and \napproximately  another  PRs1  billion  ($16.7  million)  is  provided  by  the  Government.  NHA  is \ncurrently  negotiating  with  the  Government  to  increase  funding  by  linking  it  to  the  goods  and \nservices tax levy on fuel products.  \n \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n2. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s support for roads has been developed in close collaboration with the Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation and World Bank. ADB has met regularly with both agencies in the \npreparation of this Investment Program. They have shared their respective project preparation \nmaterials and studies, and presented materials for the preparation of the Government\u2019s MTDF. \nSince  2000,  Pakistan  has  received  substantial  assistance  from  ADB,  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation,  and  World  Bank  (Appendix  5).  ADB\u2019s  provincial  project  financing \nassistance  commenced  with  Sindh  (2001  for  $200  million),  Punjab  (2002  for  $150  million), \nBalochistan  (2003  for  185.7  million),  and  NWFP  (2004  for  $243.2  million).  The  provincial \nprojects  concentrated  on  provincial  highways  and  farm-to-market  roads.  For  the  Balochistan \nand  NWFP  projects,  ADB  financed  sections  of  the  national  highways  that  form  part  of  the \nregional connectivity network with Afghanistan and associated civil works for border facilities at \nChaman (Balochistan for $3.5 million) and Torkham (NWFP for $2.3 million). \n \n18. \nSince 2001, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation has financed the construction \nworks for the Kohat Tunnel for a total of $79 million. In 2001, the World Bank financed the Trade \nand Transport Facilitation Project for $3 million, and in 2003, the Highway Rehabilitation Project \nfor $200 million. During the last 4 years, the Trade and Transport Facilitation Project has been \nactively assisting the Ministry of Commerce in reviewing, improving, and providing institutional \ncapacity building for all major agencies associated with the logistical chain for transportation of \ngoods. Under this project, the Government implemented the single administrative document, the \ngoods declaration form, and is now pilot testing it as part of the electronic document exchange \nexercise.  At  the  request  of  the  Government,  the  World  Bank  is  preparing  the  follow-on  2006 \nTrade  Facilitation  Project.  In  addition,  the  National  Logistics  Cell,  a  Government  agency,  is \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2004.

Overall,  trade  facilitation  of  freight  traffic  is  adequately \ncovered  by  the  Government  and  the  World  Bank  project.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  ongoing  Highway \nRehabilitation6  Project  focuses  on  about  856  km  of  highway  improvements  along  the  national \nhighways  N5  and  M9,  with  implementation  over  5  years.  To  date  the  World  Bank  project  has \ncommenced civil works on approximately 348 km of the project target. \n \n \n \n19. \nPrior  to  2000,  ADB-financed  road  projects  focused  on  farm-to-market  needs  and \nselective interventions in the national highway network. From 2001 onward, ADB\u2019s investment \nstrategy  shifted  to  more  focused  interventions  on  provincial  and  rural  access  roads  on  a \nprovince-by-province basis. From 2003 onward, in line with the Government\u2019s plan to integrate \nPakistan\u2019s  economy  into  the  regional  economy,  ADB  commenced  financing  sections  of  the \nnational  highway  network  with  linkages  to  Afghanistan,  on  a  selective  basis.  The  proposed \nInvestment  Program  is  ADB\u2019s  first  major  intervention  into  NHA\u2019s  operations  on  an  integrated \nbasis combining project investments and sector reforms. With respect to ADB support for road \nprojects  in  Pakistan,  experience  indicates  the  following  actions  are  generally  important  for \navoidance of delays in implementation: (i) advance procurement of civil works and recruitment \nof  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  early  establishment  of  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (iii) \nstrict  prequalification  criteria;  (iv)  advance  action  for  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  shifting  of \nutilities,  and  clearance  of  right-of-way;  and  (v)  increasing  the  authority  of  the  independent \nengineer  under  the  contract  to  ensure  efficient  and  quick  decision  making  during  execution. \nExperience  under  the  current  ADB-financed  Balochistan  and  NWFP  provincial  road  projects \nsuggests  that  highway  projects  require  (i)  early  preparation  of  project  pro  forma  (PC-1) \ndocuments  for  internal  government  approvals,  (ii)  early  preparation  and  provision  of  adequate \nresources to implement advance procurement actions, (iii) recruitment and active involvement of \nstaff in advance preparation of the project, (iv) limiting the executing and implementing agencies \nto  one  body,  (v)  early  commencement  of  training  for  executing  agency  staff  on  ADB \nprocurement  policies  and  guidelines,  and  (vi)  packaging  of  civil  works and  consulting  services \ninto larger parcels for international competitive bidding. As part of the Investment Program, NHA \nhas undertaken early preparation steps by (i) appointing staff to senior positions in the project \nteam,  including  the  project  coordination  officer  and  the  project  directors  for  the  three  sample \nsubprojects;  (ii)  completing  and  submitting  the  pro  forma  project  document  for  Government \napproval before loan negotiations for the batch 1 and batch 2 subprojects; (iii) issuing requests \nfor  proposal  documents  for  recruiting  construction  supervision  consultants;  (iv)  preparing \nprequalification of contractors documents and bidding documents for civil works; (v) convening a \nbusiness  opportunities  workshop  for  informing  international  contractors  about  future  NHA \nproject opportunities and requesting their participation; (vi) holding dedicated training seminars \non ADB procurement and recruitment of consultants procedures (conducted by ADB staff); and \n(vii) commencing preparation of feasibility studies for the five batch 2 subprojects (para. 41).  \n \n \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2005\u20132006)7  focused  objectives  for \n20. \nnational highways on supporting subregional cooperation, improving cross-border facilities and \nagreements,  improving  trade  facilitation,  and  improving  transport  efficiency  on  the  main \ntransport corridors in Pakistan. During preparation of the Investment Program, ADB found that \nthe  Government  was  using  its  own  resources  to  improve  cross-border  facilities.

Country and Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Pakistan. Manila. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nsubregional cooperation and cross-border agreements are to be undertaken as part of the ADB-\nsponsored  Central  and  South  Asian  Transport  and  Trade  Forum8  initiatives,  which  include \nreviewing regional transit arrangements. Trade facilitation activities are being undertaken by the \nWorld  Bank-financed  2001  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Project,  and  at  the  request  of  the \nGovernment, by a follow-on trade facilitation project being prepared for 2006 processing by the \nWorld Bank. Classifying a project as subregional has been difficult as the project is required to \nquantify the project economic benefits accruing to the subregional countries. This has not been \nfeasible  due  to  difficulty  securing  accurate  trade  statistics.  Because  of  recent  developments \nwhereby most of the original objectives were being addressed by other Government initiatives \nand  to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts,  the  focus  of  the  Investment  Program  was  modified  to \nconcentrate  on  enhancing  the  capacity  of  NHA  to  become  a  sustainable  and  efficient \norganization  to  operate  and  maintain  a  sustainable  national  highway  network.9  This  modified \nfocus  supports  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  objectives  of  sustainable  pro-poor \ngrowth and the Government\u2019s decision as part of its debt management strategy to only borrow \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources for priority infrastructure projects and provincial resource \nmanagement programs. In addition, at the first management review meeting, ADB management \napproved increasing ADB\u2019s cost sharing to 80% to support the Government\u2019s need to mobilize \nresources in support of urgent infrastructure development. \n \n21. \nAs  highlighted  in  the  Government\u2019s  MTDF,  Pakistan  is  planning  to  undertake  a  large \nprogram  of  improving  the  national  highway  network  over  the  next  10  years  at  a  total  cost  of \nPRs169.3  billion  ($2.82  billion).  To  finance  the  program,  the  Government  is  reliant  upon \nfinancing from bilateral and multilateral agencies, domestic banks, and private sector sponsors. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide an MFF under which ADB will provide individual \nloans  for  subprojects  based  on  the  completion  of  feasibility  studies  and  advance  project \npreparation activities in accordance with the Framework Financing Agreement (FFA) (para. 49). \nBecause of the potential large scale of lending, a programmatic10 approach will be adopted and \nprojects  will  be  developed  in  a  sequential  and  progressive  manner.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  sector \nstrategy  is  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  the  efficient  and  sustainable  development  of \nthe  highway  system  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  public  for  increased  mobility  and  efficient  cargo \nmovement.  \n \n \n \n22. \nADB  has  been  engaged  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  NHA  since  2001, \nand  has  provided  loans  and  TA  in  support  of  critical  policy  and  institutional  reform  processes. \nThe  major  national  policy  reform  actions  taken  to  date  include  (i)  substantive  preparation  of  a \nnational transport policy (NTP); (ii) preparation of rolling five-year medium-term investment and \nmaintenance  plans;  (iii)  tolling  of  sections  of  the  national  highway  network  and  use  of  toll \nreceipts  for  road  development  and  maintenance  programs;  (iv)  setting  up  of  the  Road  Asset \nManagement Directorate, fully functioning since 2003; (v) enforcement of the National Highways \nSafety Ordinance and extending it to cover additional road lengths in each successive year; (vi) \ncollection  of  monetary  penalties  from  2003  onward  for  violation  of  traffic  ordinances  and \nallocating the collections toward road development and maintenance programs; (vii) continued \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n5. \n\n                                                 \n8   This is an ADB-sponsored initiative, which commenced in 2003, with the objective to facilitate transport connectivity \nand  trade  in  the  subregion  by  focusing  on  (i)  customs  harmonization,  (ii)  law  enforcement  on  drug  and  human \ntrafficking, (iii) border crossing facilities, and (iv) regional transit trade agreements. \n\n9  The  original  project  tile  was  changed  from  Subregional  Connectivity  and  Trade  Facilitation  Project  to  National \n\nHighway Development Sector Investment Program. \n\n10 The approach should be distinguished from a program loan lending modality, which is essentially based on policy \nreform.  The  loans  are  essentially  designed  as  investment  projects  that  will  be  prepared  just  like  typical  highway \nprojects, but with the policy reform elements to be implemented in a systematic, sequential, and coherent manner. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nimplementation  of  the  program  to  decrease  NHA  staff  strength;  (viii)  introduction  of  standard \noperating  procedures  for  financial  management  and  an  accompanying  financial  manual;  (ix) \nrecruitment  of  financial  experts  for  NHA;  and  (x)  installation  of  weighbridges  to  control  axle \nloads. \n \n23. \nAlthough significant progress has been made on major policy and institutional issues, a \nnumber  of  areas  remain  to  be  addressed  before  and  during  implementation  of  the Investment \nProgram.  Subsequent  to  extensive  policy  dialogue  with  NHA,  agreement  was  reached  on  the \nRoad Sector Development Framework (RSDF), and adopting a programmatic approach (para. \n21).  The  RSDF  comprises  major  policy  reform  actions  and  implementation  target  dates \n(Appendix 6). Because the Investment Program will be implemented over 10 years, the RSDF \nwill  be  implemented  in  two  phases.  Phase  1  (2006\u20132008)  will  focus  on  agreed  milestones, \nwhich will act as building blocks for the remainder of the Investment Program. Phase 2 will be \nbased  on  the  progress  achieved  during  phase  1,  and  identification  of  additional  capacity-\nbuilding  measures  including  sector  reforms  required  to  ensure  sustainable  NHA  development. \nThe  policy  reform  milestones  (contained  in  the  RSDF)  agreed  with  NHA  will  be  reviewed  for \ncompliance,  as  part  of  the  review  process  for  all  individual  periodic  financing  requests \nscheduled to be completed by 2011. For implementation of the RSDF, NHA will be assisted by \nconsultants with the requisite expertise (para. 63). \n \nThe  RSDF  focuses  on  five  policy  areas  for  improvement:  (i)  promulgating  the  NTP;  (ii) \n24. \nfacilitating  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  in  road  construction,  maintenance,  and  toll \ncollection;  (iii)  providing  NHA  with  institutional  development  and  improving  its  strategic  focus; \n(iv)  embedding  concern  for  road  safety  in  the  decision-making  process;  and  (v)  ensuring \nsustainable funding of road maintenance. The RSDF takes into consideration the initial findings \nof  the  Business  Process  Reengineering  Study11  undertaken  by  NHA-appointed  consultants \nunder the World Bank financed Highway Rehabilitation Project. These actions accord with the \npolicy matrix requirements of the 2001 Road Sector Development Program loan (footnote 1). \n \n\na. \n\nNational Transport Policy \n\n \n\n25. \nGovernment promulgation of the NTP and its implementation are a prerequisite for the \neffective  development  of  a  sustainable  and  cost-effective  transport  system.  The  recently \napproved MTDF12 represents an important step in developing the NTP, defining the investment \nneeds  at  the  project  level.  The  ongoing  National  Transport  Master  Plan  Study13  will  provide  a \ncomprehensive  database  for  supporting  analysis  and  policy  making.  Developing  the  NTP \nprovides  an  opportunity  for  modal  priorities  to  be  reviewed;  for  intermodal  opportunities  to  be \ndetermined; and for macro objectives, responsibilities, and funding mechanisms to be reviewed. \nThe NTP will provide the framework within which the infrastructure development and institutional \ncomponents  of  this  Investment  Program  and  ADB\u2019s  planned  subsequent  sector  interventions \ncan be most effective. This will ensure that their benefits are realized and that implementation is \nstructured to ensure seamless integration with other NTP initiatives. \n \n26. \nfinancial  and  economic \nassessment,  developing  the  NTP  will  require  detailed  discussions  with stakeholders  (including \nprovincial governments, railways, civil aviation, roads, seaports, inland waterways, and users). \n                                                 \n11 The Business Process Reengineering Study focuses on streamlining NHA procedures for core activities, including \n\ntechnical  research  and \n\nthe  appropriate \n\nIn  addition \n\nto \n\naccounting and finance, administration and general operations, and computerization. \n\n12 The  MTDF  2005\u20132010,  prepared  by  the  Planning  Commission,  represents  the  Government\u2019s  infrastructure \n\ninvestment program for all sectors. \n\n13 The  first  phase  of  the  National  Transport  Master  Plan  study,  financed  by  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \n\nCooperation, focuses on the collection of transport statistics and is expected to be completed by March 2006. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nTo achieve an effective NTP, the consultation process must be effectively managed. ADB has \nprovided assistance in the initial preparation of an NTP document, and the consultation process \nis about to start. To assist the Government, ADB is providing TA14 to support the consultation \nprocess. The Investment Program will assist the Government in developing the NTP, which will \nprovide NHA with an enabling environment for institutional development. The NTP is expected \nto be promulgated by 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M1). \n \n\nb. \n\nEnhancing Public-Private Partnerships in the Provision of Road \nTransport Infrastructure \n\n \n27. \nNHA is faced with a major funding challenge to implement the MTDF. PPP financing is \nproposed as part of the solution to finance 18% of the 2005\u20132010 funding requirement. Given \nlimited  progress  with  PPP,  this  target  places  a  considerable  demand  on  NHA's  management \ncapabilities. Private sector participation should be developed at a rate that accords with NHA's \nability  to  effectively  manage  it.  Poorly  executed  PPP  projects  not  only  fail  to  realize  their \npotential benefits, but they may discourage future initiatives. \n \n28. \nDuring TA to facilitate PPP initiatives in national highway development (footnote 3), the \nADB consultants assisted NHA in (i) preparing a revised draft policy and regulatory framework \nfor private sector participation in national highways, motorways, tunnels, and bridges, which is \nnow under consideration by the Cabinet Committee for Investments; (ii) preparing an action plan \nfor improving the legal and regulatory framework for private sector participation; (iii) developing \ncomprehensive  PPP  tender  documents  for  future  PPP  projects;  (iv)  undertaking  a  preliminary \nreview  and  improvement  of  NHA\u2019s  proposed  build-operate-transfer  projects  over  the  next  5 \nyears;  and  (v)  reviewing  institutional  arrangements  necessary  to  carry  out  PPP  projects, \nincluding creating a PPP cell in NHA. \n \n29. \nThe TA notes that NHA should reevaluate the PPP program, which is seen as optimistic. \nTo  select  activities  for  ADB  financing  under  the  proposed  Public-Private  Initiative  for  National \nHighway  Development  Project  in  2006,15  a  full  review  of  the  current  PPP  financing  strategy  is \nnecessary by 31 July 2006 (Project milestone M2-1). The bidding and implementation progress \nof the 2006 PPP project will be considered prior to commencing the midterm review, scheduled \nfor  June  2008.  NHA  agreed  to  a  target  value  of  total  PPP  projects  of  approximately           \nPRs60 billion, which will be prepared for bid invitations by the time a project(s) is selected for \nthe proposed ADB financing of a second PPP project in 2008. The pipeline of PPP projects is \ntargeted to be available by 31 July 2008 (Project milestone M2-2). Project preparation requires \nthat a funding proposal be developed such that the expected financial internal rate of return is \nsufficiently robust to attract private sector participation. \n \n \n \n30. \nNetwork/Business Planning and Institutional Reform. NHA has been called upon to \ndevelop,  operate,  and  maintain  a  sustainable  national  highway  network  to  meet  the \nrequirements  of  the  public  on  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  basis.  To  successfully  deliver  on \nthis challenge, NHA must transform itself into a service-driven organization with a strong service \nbase for road users, which makes appropriate use of internal and external resources to deliver \noutcomes  that  match  the  needs  of  the  community.  Toward  this  goal,  the  Investment  Program \n\nInstitutional Development of NHA \n\nc. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Transport  Policy  Support.  Manila  (TA \n\n4400, approved on 30 September, for $290,000). \n\n15 In  the  2005\u20132006  country  strategy  and  program  update  (footnote  7),  the  Public-Private  Initiative  for  National \n\nHighway Development Project, for $50 million, is shown as a firm loan for 2006. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nwill  incorporate  a  component  designed  to  provide  TA  to  the  Government  to  help  clarify  NHA \ngoals,  define  the  form  of  the  organization  most  likely  to  efficiently  support  the  achievement  of \nthese  goals,  support  the  transformation  of  NHA  into  that  new  form,  and  build  the  institutional \ncapacity and develop the improved funding options required to ensure the sustainability of the \nnew  organization.  An  essential  first  step  in  the  institutional  reform  process  will  be  for  NHA  to \nclearly  chart  its  agenda,  outline  the  capability  improvements  it  must  undertake  to  successfully \npursue its agenda, analyze the legal and administrative regulatory constrains that may impede \nthe pursuit of its agenda, and articulate an action plan to address each of the related issues. \n \n31. \nTA  will  be  provided  to  NHA  under  the  Investment  Program  to  develop  a  strategy  for \nprogressive  federalizing  of  key  provincial  highways  to  establish  an  optimal  national  highway \nnetwork  and  for  the  preparation  of  a  network  investment  plan  2007\u20132011  for  this  network, \ndrawing  on  the  database  being  established  in  the  National  Transport  Master  Plan  study  for \nproject  appraisal.  Delivery  of  the  network/business  plan  together  with  an  NHA  institutional \nreform  program  and  associated  time-bound  action  plans  is  targeted  for  31  January  2007 \n(Project  milestone  M3-1).  Government  endorsement  of  the  plans/program  and  actions  are \nexpected by 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M3-2). \n \n32. \nTransparency  and  Accountability  Policies.  Road  users  and  taxpayers  need  to  be \ngiven a role in reviewing the needs, priorities, and effectiveness of road system management. \nThis  will  require  improvements  in  NHA  practices  with  regard  to  disclosure  and  public \naccountability.  NHA  will  need  to  significantly  increase  transparency  in  all  aspects  of  its \noperations  from  hiring  staff  to  financial  management.  Supportive  measures  should  include  (i) \nbasing programming, scheduling, and budgeting of rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures \non  rational  criteria  and  clearly  defined  targets  that  maximize  economic  returns  and  allow \nperformance to be judged; (ii) introducing a comprehensive program of community consultation \nand  a  process  for  incorporating  the  outcomes  of  this  consultation  in  decision  making;  (iii) \ncontinually  developing  adequate  and  appropriate  procurement  guidelines  and  processes;  (iv) \nestablishing a website for registering grievances associated with the Investment Program; and \n(v) establishing audit processes using independent experts to monitor performance of all these \naspects. NHA\u2019s Vigilance Department reports independently to the Ministry of Communications \nand the NHA chairperson. The department also regularly submits reports to the NHA executive \nboard.  NHA  agreed  to  establish  a  website,  maintained  by  the  Vigilance  Department,  for \nregistering complaints associated with the Investment Program. The website will be functioning \nby 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M3-3). \n \n\nd. \n\nRoad Safety on National Highway Network \n\n \n \n33. \nPakistan\u2019s  road  accident  rates  are  among  the  highest  in  Asia  due  to  a  number  of \nfactors,  including  inadequate  enforcement  of  safety  regulations,  an  ineffective  vehicle \ninspection  system,  and  inadequate  safety  training.  With  increasing  traffic  and  a  growing \nnational  highway  network,  NHA  is  urgently  required  to  establish  clear  primary  portfolio \nresponsibility for national highway safety program delivery and to establish a closer liaison with \nthe National Highway and Motorway Police. The Investment Program will address the issue of \nroad  safety  by  supporting  (i)  design  of  a  national  highway  safety  program,  and  (ii) \nestablishment of a road safety cell within NHA by 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M4-1). An \nimproved  robust  measurement  and  quarterly  reporting  of  road  accidents  and  the  causes  and \nimpacts  of  accidents  as  a  part  of  a  national  road  safety  policy  and  targets  are  also  required. \nUnder the NWFP Road Development Sector and Connectivity Project (footnote 5), the National \nHighway  and  Motorway  Police  is  undertaking  a  pilot  safety  study  on  sample  sections  of  the \nnational highway road in NWFP. The pilot study is expected to commence in November 2005 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nand results from it will be incorporated in the Investment Program. An action plan acceptable to \nADB  for  institutionalizing  the  pilot  study  recommendations  will  be  prepared  by  30  June  2007 \n(Project milestone M4-2). \n\n \n \n\ne. \n\nSustainable Delivery of Road Maintenance \n\nroad  maintenance  activities.  The \n\n \n34.  Maintenance of the highway network requires constant improvement in the utilization of \ntechnical  expertise  and  maintenance  techniques.  NHA  has  implemented  the  Road  Asset \nManagement  Directorate  and  to  date  it  has  achieved  positive  results  in  planning  and \nimplementing \nInvestment  Program  will  support  a \ncomprehensive review of the options for delivery of the NHA maintenance programs. Increased \noptions  for  effective  outsourcing  may  be  achieved  by  better  packaging  of  maintenance  and \nconstruction projects to foster the development of private sector provision. This could extend to \nmultiyear comprehensive contracts for the maintenance of specified sections of the network to \ndefined performance standards and the introduction of corridor maintenance schemes. Recent \nhighway  design  maintenance  (HDM)  analysis  based  on  the  NHA  maintenance  program \nconcluded that the average maintenance requirements will be approximately PRs6.3 billion per \nyear  for  the  next  5  years.  NHA  currently  receives  net  toll  revenues  of  approximately  PRs4 \nbillion per year; when combined with the Ministry of Finance maintenance grant of about PRs1 \nbillion per year, NHA is almost self-sustaining in terms of maintenance financing for the next 5 \nyears. For the remaining funding gap, NHA is currently discussing different proposals with the \nMinistry of Finance to ensure sustainable funding of the established road maintenance account. \nLikely  funding  services  earmarked  for  the  account  include  the  goods  and  services  tax  levy \nimposed  on  fuel  for  road  vehicles, collections  from  road  tolls  and  weigh  stations,  right-of-way \ncommercialization, billboards, and police fine collections. These proposals should be delivered \nby 30 June 2006 (Project milestone M5-1). Government endorsement of the maintenance plan \nand its underwriting of the funding are programmed for 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M5-2). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n35. \nThe Investment Program is to advance policy reform in  Pakistan to create an enabling \nenvironment  for  the  efficient  and  sustainable  development  of  the  national  highway  network.  It \nwill  also  support  growth  in  trade  by  improving  regional  connectivity  on  the  Asian  highway \nnetwork  and  thereby  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  RSDF \n(Appendix  6)  developed  and  agreed  upon  with  NHA  will  serve  as  a  plan  for  future  lending  to \nPakistan\u2019s  highway  sector.  The  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  achieve  two  specific \nobjectives.  The  first  is  to  improve  transport  efficiency  by  (i)  facilitating  adoption  of  a  national \ntransport policy, (ii) strengthening NHA performance in managing the national highway network, \n(iii) improving road safety, and (iv) improving road maintenance and road maintenance funding. \nThe  second  objective  is  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  road  sector  by  (i) \nincreasing  outsourcing  of  road  works,  and  (ii)  exploring  opportunities  for  private  operation  of \nNHA  assets  and  activities  along  its  right-of-way.  To  realize  these  objectives,  the  Investment \nProgram will comprise national highway improvements and institutional strengthening of NHA. \n \nB. \n \n36. \nThe Government\u2019s 10-year National Highway Infrastructure Program ending 2014/15 will \nbe  implemented  under  the  Investment  Program  by  undertaking  subprojects  in  three  batches. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n1. \n \n\nADB\u2019s  MFF  will  be  used  to  finance  the  Investment  Program.  The  first  batch  represents  three \nsample subprojects for which detailed designs have been completed and advance preparation \nactivities  are  substantially  complete  (paras.  38\u201340  and  Appendix  7).  The  second  batch \ncomprises  five  subprojects  for  which  detailed  engineering  designs  and  feasibility  studies  are \ncurrently in progress (Appendix 7). These subprojects are expected to be ready for submission \nto  ADB  during  2007.  The  third  batch  of  subprojects  will  be  identified  during  implementation  of \nthe  Investment  Program  and  is  targeted  for  submission  to ADB  during  2009\u20132010.  The  policy \nreform component will be undertaken in two phases, the first phase (up to 2008) will focus on \nimplementation  of  the  agreed  RSDF,  and  the  second  phase  will  cover  the  remainder  of  the \ninvestment program period. \n \n37. \n \n\nThe Investment Program will have two components:  \n\nNational  highway  improvement.  Highways  of  the  Pakistan  domestic  transport \nsystem  serving  interprovincial  traffic  among  Balochistan,  NWFP,  Punjab,  and \nSindh  will  be  improved,  along  with  selected  national  highways  facilitating  the \nmovement of freight traffic with Iran and Afghanistan, and the seaports located at \nKarachi and Qasim in Sindh with Afghanistan and the central Asian republics via \nTorkham  (in  NWFP)  and  Chaman  (in  Balochistan).  In  addition,  the  Investment \nProgram  will  provide  vehicle  parking  and  service  facilities  along  the  subproject \nhighway corridors (paras. 38-43). \n\nInstitutional  strengthening  of  NHA.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  facilitate \nfinalization of an NTP, facilitate PPP transactions, and build institutional capacity \nin network/business planning, road safety, and road maintenance (para. 44). \n\nNational Highway Improvements \n\nFirst Batch of Sample Subprojects \n\na. \n \n\n38. \nNHA  has  identified  three  subproject  roads  totaling  376  km  that  meet  the  agreed \nselection criteria (Appendix 8) and represent the typical geophysical, environmental, and social \nconditions  throughout  the  highway  network.  NHA  prepared  the  three  sample  subprojects  and \nADB  staff  consultants  completed  the  due  diligence.  Sample  subproject  preparation  involved  a \nfeasibility  study;  environmental,  social,  and  resettlement  assessments;  detailed  engineering; \nand  preparation  of  bidding  documents.  The  design  approach  and  technical  standards  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n39. \nThe sample subprojects comprise (i) N25: Hub\u2013Uthal, widening and improving the Hub\u2013\nUthal section to 2-lane national standard road with 7.3 meter (m)-wide pavement and 3 m-wide \nshoulder  (84.5  km);  (ii)  N50:  Khanozai\u2013Zhob,  widening  and  improving  the  Khanozai\u2013Zhob \nsection to 2-lane national standard road with 7.3 m-wide pavement and 3 m-wide shoulder (255 \nkm),  including  construction  of  the  Muslim  Bagh  bypass;  and  (iii)  N70:  Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh, \nexpanding the existing 2-lane road between Multan and Muzaffargarh to 4-lane standard road \nwith shoulder (20 km) and construction of a 4-lane bypass (16.5 km) to avoid the Muzaffargarh \nurban area.  \n \n40. \nUthal, (ii) N50, Khanozai\u2013Zhob, and (iii) N70, Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh is as follows: \n \n\nThe  justification  for  selection  of  the  three  sample  subprojects,  namely  (i)  N25,  Hub\u2013\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nN25:  Hub\u2013Uthal  (84.5  km).  The  Hub\u2013Uthal  section  of  N25  provides  the  only \nroute  from  Karachi  to  the  newly  opened  Makran  Coastal  Road,  the  653  km \nCoastal  Highway  N10,  which  services  the  new  deepwater  port  at  Gwadar  and \nconnects  to  Gabd  and  the  Iranian  border.  In  the  north,  N25  connects  to  N40, \nwhich runs west to Iran via Taftan. On completion of this subproject, all but the \n40  km  Bela\u2013Kararo  section  of  N25  will  have  been  upgraded  to  a  7.3  m \ncarriageway.  ADB  is  currently  financing  the  upgrading  of  the  Kalat\u2013Quetta  and \nQuetta\u2013Chaman  sections  of  N25  under  the  Balochistan  Road  Development \nSector Project loan.16 \n\nN50:  Khanozai\u2013Zhob  (255  km).  N50  is  of  considerable  strategic  importance, \nrunning  parallel  to  the  border  with  Afghanistan  and  being  the  closest  national \nhighway  to  the  border.  It  provides  by  far  the  most  direct  route  between \nBalochistan  and  the  north  and  northeast  of  the  country.  It  starts  from  the \nintersection with N25, at km711, some 26 km north of Quetta and 106 km south \nof the Afghan border crossing at Chaman. N50 runs east via the important local \ncenters  of  Muslin  Bagh,  Qila  Saifullah,  Zhob,  and  Mughalkot,  ending  at  an \nintersection  with  the  Indus  Highway  N55  at  D.I.  Khan.  The  major  east\u2013west \nhighway,  the  N70  starts  from  the  N50  in  Qila  Saifullah,  providing  a  direct \nconnection  to  the  Punjab  via  D.G.  Khan  and  Multan.  After  the  planned \nimprovement of N50 and N70, these highways  will be the main routes between \nQuetta  in  northern  Balochistan  and  NWFP  and/or  Punjab,  and  will  serve \nsubregional traffic on the corridor from Iran, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian \nrepublics. \n\nN70: Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh (36.5 km). The N70 runs west from the N5 at Multan \nto  the  N50  at  Qila  Saifullah,  a  distance  of  441  km.  It  is  the  most  direct  route \nbetween  southern  Punjab  and  northern  Balochistan,  and  onward  to  southern \nAfghanistan  (via  the  N50/N25  to  Chaman)  and  to  Iran  (via  the  N50/N40).  It  will \nalso serve in the future as a subregional route between India, Afghanistan, and \nIran.

The  facilities  to  be \nprovided  include  (i)  paved  parking,  (ii)  emergency  repairs,  (iii)  restaurants,  (iv)  refueling,  (v) \nprayer area, (vi) overnight accommodation, and (vii) emergency medical services. The facilities \nwill be leased out to private operators on a long-term basis. \n \n \n \n44. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  undertake  implementation  of  identified  policy  reform \nactions  agreed  with  NHA  and  the  Government  (paras.  23\u201334).  Areas  identified  for  policy  and \ninstitutional  development  include  (i)  formulation  of  an  NTP,  (ii)  enhancement  of  PPP  in  road \ninfrastructure development, (iii) institutional capacity building of NHA including network/business \nplanning and transparency and accountability policies, (iv) national highway road safety, and (v) \nroad maintenance. In addition, the implementation of a computerized management information \nsystem  for  daily  traffic  flow  analysis  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  improvements  for  road \noperations.  The  policy  reforms  to  be  undertaken  during  the  second  phase  (2009\u20132015)  will \ninclude a review of the outcomes from the first phase, updating of the RSDF, and formulation of \nsecond generation reforms to be implemented during the second phase. \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nSubregional Development \n\n \n45. \nThe  majority  of  the  project  corridors  form  part  of  the  Asian  highway  network  and  the \ntrade corridors identified by the Central and South Asian Transport and Trade Forum. Together \nwith  ongoing  and  planned  road  projects  in  Afghanistan,  the  Investment  Program  supports \nsubregional cooperation through physical and nonphysical improvements of critical sections of \nN25,  N50,  and  N70,  which  all  form  part  of  the  transport  corridors  for  Afghanistan,  Iran,  and \nIndia.  In  addition  to  providing  improved  access  to  ports  in  southern  Pakistan,  the  Investment \nProgram  will  facilitate  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the  corridor  areas  through \nimproved  access  and  easier  movement  of  people  and  goods;  these  help  reduce  poverty  and \nsupport pro-poor economic growth.  \n \n\nCapacity Building for Environmental and Social Assessments \n\n2. \n \n46. \nNHA  lacks  staff,  expertise,  and  capacity  to  carry  out  environmental  and  social \nassessment requirements. To address these constraints, NHA has agreed to establish separate \norganization  cells  for  these  assessment  activities.  To  assist  NHA  to  fulfill  the  requirements,  a \nprogram  with  actions  to  enhance  in-house  capacity  will  be  developed  and  implemented  under \nthe  Investment  Program.  A  consultant  team  on  environment  and  social  development  will  be \nrecruited  as  part  of  the  project  management  office  to  help  NHA  prepare  and  implement  the \ncapacity-building measures. \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n3. \n\nMultitranche Financing Modality \n\n \n47. \nUnder the MFF, the amount and timing of financing requests will be at the discretion of \nthe  Government,  subject  to  meeting  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  FFA,  and  be  mainly \ndetermined by the progress achieved under preceding individual loans approved under the MFF \nand  NHA\u2019s  readiness  for  new  subprojects.  The  MFF  provides  NHA  with  the  confidence  that \nfinancing  of  the  agreed  Investment  Program  is  now  undertaken  with  certainty  and  financial \nefficiency,  because  financing  will  only  be  made  available  when  the  projects  are  ready.  As  a \nresult, only projects ready for implementation will be financed, thereby reducing borrowing costs \nand speeding up implementation.  \n \nD. \n \n48. \nThe total cost of NHDP is $2.3 billion, out of which the Investment Program is estimated \nat  $966.8  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  on  the \nloan during construction (Table 3; Appendix 9 provides details). \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nTable 3: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \n\n1.1  Batch 1 Subprojects \n1.2  Batch 2 Subprojects \n1.3  Batch 3 Subprojects \n1.4  Other Costs \nInterest during Construction  \nInstitutional Strengthening of National Highway Authority \n\n1.

The  Investment \nProgram  will  be  financed  by  utilizing  the  MFF17  under  which  separate  multiple  loans  will  be \nextended to finance a range of subprojects under the Investment Program subject to submission \nof  related  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  by  the  Government.  The  Government  and  NHA \nhave entered into a FFA with ADB. The FFA satisfies the requirements set forth in Appendix 4 \nof the Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities (see footnote 17). The Government is required \nto comply with the FFA requirements. The Government intends to finance NHDP by submitting \nfive PFRs by 31 December 2011. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted to ADB \nthe  first  PFR  in  the  amount  of  $180  million.  The  first  PFR  is  presented  to  the  Board,  together \nwith  the  FFA.  The  investment  capacity  of  NHA  was  determined  by  its  financial  capacity  after \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2005.

R194-05). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ntaking into consideration commitments to ongoing projects and future investment program. The \nADB  loans  will  finance  civil  works,  consulting  services,  land  and  resettlement  costs,  project \nmanagement, incremental costs, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction. \n \nThe proposed ADB loans will have an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace \n50. \nperiod of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank-offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  rate  system.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i) the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government \nhas the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest rate regime for each loan. \nThe specific terms of each loan will depend on the circumstances of the related PFR within the \nparameters of the LIBOR-based loan window. \n  \n51. \nIn  addition,  the  Government  requested  a  loan  of  $3.0  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  finance  the  institutional  strengthening  component.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nFor all the loans, the Borrower will be Pakistan, which will pass on the proceeds of the \n52. \nloan  to  NHA,  the  Executing  Agency,  in  local  currency  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \npolicies in this regard.

An  investment  program \ncoordinating committee, chaired by the NHA chairperson, will be responsible for monitoring the \nuse  of  loan  funds  and  overall  implementation  performance.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least \nquarterly.  Two  project  management  offices  will  be  instituted:  one  for  the  institutional \nstrengthening  of  NHA  component  and  the  second  for  implementation  of  the  national  highway \nimprovements. Members of the investment program coordinating committee and the two project \nmanagement  offices,  and  the  implementation  arrangements  are  shown  in  Appendix  10.  The \npolicy formulation and coordination office will be headed by the NHA member (planning) and the \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\ninvestment  program  management  office  by  the  NHA  member  (ADB-NHDSIP).  The  principal \ncoordination officer reporting to the general manager (NHDSIP) has been appointed.  \n \n54. \nNHA will establish a PIU for each subproject. The PIU will be adequately staffed within 2 \nmonths of loan effectiveness or before the award of civil works contracts, whichever is earlier. \nEach  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  director  (at  the  director  level)  and  in  addition  to  NHA \nstaffing,  the  unit  will  be  complemented  with  an  externally  recruited  construction  supervision \nteam.  They  will  be  assisted  by  deputy  project  directors  for  each  civil  works  contract  package. \nNHA has advanced project preparation activities by appointing project directors for the batch 1 \nsubprojects.  For  subprojects  involving  land  acquisition,  resettlement  activities,  and  handling  of \ngrievances \nincluding  project-affected  people  and  nongovernment \norganizations,  and  environmental  impacts,  NHA  will  provide  the  necessary  expertise  from  the \nresources.  An \nconstruction \naccountant/administration  specialist  will  be  assigned  to  each  PIU.  Sufficient  administrative \nauthority will be delegated to the PIUs for effective and timely project implementation. The PIU \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 11. \n \n\nfrom  NHA \n\nsupervision \n\nthe  public \n\nconsultant \n\nfiled  by \n\nteam \n\nstaff \n\nor \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n55. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  over  10  years,  inclusive  of  procurement \nand  preconstruction  activities,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  30  June  2015.  Under  the \nnational highways improvement component, civil works will be bid out in three batches. The first \nbatch  of  subprojects  is  at  an  advanced  project  preparation  stage,  and  mobilization  of \nconstruction supervision consultants and civil works are expected to commence in March 2006 \nand  June  2006  respectively.  For  batch  2  and  3  subprojects,  NHA  will  develop  detailed \nimplementation plans at the time of the submission of the PFRs. The implementation schedule \nwill  allow  for  acquisition  of  land  free  from  encumbrances;  resettlement;  and  clearance  of  all \nutilities,  trees,  and  any  other  obstructions  from  the  land  to  be  used  for  construction.  For  the \npolicy  reform  component,  implementation  will  be  undertaken  in  two  phases  (para.  44).  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n56. \nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. To ensure a competitive bidding process, international competitive \nbidding  contract  packages  will  be  encouraged.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  bidders.  Civil  works  contracts  with  an \nestimated  value  less  than  $5  million  will  be  procured  using  local  competitive  bidding.  Supply \ncontracts  will  use  international  shopping  for  contracts  with  an  estimated  value  of  $100,000\u2013\n$500,000,  and  direct  purchase  arrangements  for  contracts  of  less  than  $100,000.  The \nGovernment  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy18  in  all \nbidding and contract documents. \n \n57. \nSubproject  batches  1  and  2  involve  nine  international  competitive  bidding  contract \npackages for road improvement civil works. The contract packaging takes into account the need \nfor a balance between (i) minimizing administration by consolidating works in larger contracts, \nand  (ii)  designing  package  sizes  that  will  enable  international  contractors  to  participate. \nIndicative  contract  packages  are  in  Appendix  13.  Determination  of  the  remainder  of  the \nsubprojects and accompanying civil works packages will be done during project implementation. \nConsidering  that  the  civil  works  are  standard,  and  the  works  have  been  packaged  to  enable \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1998.

Retroactive  financing  is  sought  for  eligible  expenditures \nincluding land acquisition and resettlement costs, business opportunities seminars, incremental \ncosts, consulting services, and civil works. The Government has been informed that approval of \nadvance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  in  any  way  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the subprojects. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n59. \nInternational  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  assist  NHA  in  implementing  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  terms  of  reference  for  all  loan-financed  consulting  services  will  be \nsubject  to  prior  ADB  approval.  International  consultants  recruited  as  a  consulting  firm  will  be \nengaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its  Borrowers.  For \ninternational consultants, recruitment will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants, and for domestic consultants, arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n  \n60. \nFor the batch 1 and 2 subprojects, three ADB-financed consulting services packages will \nprovide support for the bidding process and construction supervision of civil works for highway \nimprovement.  The  consultants  will  help  with  construction  supervision  of  the  nine  civil  works \npackages  covering  the  eight  subprojects  located  in  different  areas  in  the  country.  Consulting \nservices  for  batch  3  subprojects  will  be  prepared  during  implementation  of  the  Investment \nProgram. Detailed engineering design and feasibility studies for the batch 2 and 3 subprojects \nwill  be  undertaken  by  locally  recruited  consultants  and  financed  from  NHA  resources.  A \nsummary  of  consulting service  packages  for  batch  1  and 2  subprojects  is  in  Appendix  14  and \nthe  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  for  construction  supervision  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n \n61. \nIn  addition  to  the  recruitment  of  consultants  through  firms,  NHA  will  engage  individual \nexperts as follows: (i) a locally based resettlement specialist to prepare resettlement plans for all \nsubprojects; undertake land acquisition and resettlement activities; and conduct training of NHA \nstaff  for  strengthening  the  capacity  of  overall  planning  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement  activities;  (ii)  an  international  social  monitoring  specialist  for  independent \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting  of  the  progress  of  activities  associated  with  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement;  (iii)  international  environment  expert  to  oversee  environmental \ncompliance  of  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (November  2002)  and  safeguard  measures  for  all \nsubprojects; and (iv) a contract specialist to assist NHA in the process associated with engaging \nconsultants  and  procuring  civil  works.  All  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  through \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  three  consultants  in  (i)\u2013(iii)  are \nshown in Supplementary Appendixes C, D, and E, respectively. \n \n                                                 \n19 However, requests for extension from bidders will be favorably considered up to 60 days and 90 days, respectively. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nFor  the  institutional  strengthening  of  NHA,  international  consulting  services  (financed \n62. \nfrom the Special Funds resources loan, para. 51) will be recruited to assist NHA in implementing \npolicy  reforms  as  agreed  with  NHA.  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  and \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2002) will be used. The terms of reference \nare  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  In  addition,  individual  expertise  including  contract \nadministration  specialists  and  financial  advisers,  as  required  by  NHA,  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nits  commitment \n\n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \n63. \nand  NHA.  Consistent  with \nto  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Investment  Program.  To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the subprojects. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Investment Program will include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  NHA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n64. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(January  2001),  and  Disbursement  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based \nLoan  Products  (July  2002),  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Direct  payment  procedures  will \ngenerally be used for large civil works contracts and consulting services. NHA will establish an \nimprest  account  for  the  Investment  Program  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan,  with  an  initial \nadvance equivalent to the estimated eligible project expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% \nof the loan amount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be established, managed, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nagreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  account  for  any \nindividual payment under $100,000. \n\n \n8. \n\n \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Reports \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \n65. \nNHA  and  the  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures incurred for the project, and use of local funds. These project accounts and related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  NHA  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related \nfinancial  statements  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  audit  of  the \nimprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  regular  annual \naudit.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  the  examination  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nReports \n\n \n66. \nNHA will prepare and submit to ADB monthly and quarterly progress reports on investment \nprogram implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. NHA will monitor \nproject preparation and implementation in accordance with the implementation schedule, and will \nkeep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant  deviations  from  the  schedule.  The  quarterly  report  will \nsummarize  the  information  in  the  detailed  reports,  including  basic  data,  utilization  of  funds, \nachievement  of  immediate  development  objectives,  compliance  with  covenants,  implementation \nprogress, land acquisition, resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. \n \n67.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  subprojects,  NHA  will  provide  ADB  with  a \nproject completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractors\u2019 \nand  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  economic  rate  of  return,  and  other \ndetails  as  may  be  requested  by  ADB.  In  addition,  within  3  months  of  each  loan  closing  date,  a \nloan completion report is to be provided. At the end of the MFF period, a facility completion report \nis to be provided within 3 months. \n \n \n \n68. \nNHA will establish a capability for systematic investment program performance monitoring \nand  analysis  throughout  the  life  of  the  Investment  Program,  integrated  with  their  management \ninformation  system.  Initially,  a  baseline  for  performance  monitoring  will  be  established  and \nthereafter,  surveys  will  be  conducted  annually.  The  scope  of  the  survey,  quantity  and  quality  of \ndata, and frequency for collection will be guided primarily by the project management\u2019s need for \nprogressive  rapid  feedback  on  implementation  status,  as  well  as  early  warning  of  impending \nsituations that might jeopardize attainment of the development objectives. The key indicators and \nassumptions outlined at the impact and outcome levels in the design framework (Appendix 1) will \nform the core of the data required for rapid assessment. \n \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation   \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n \n69. \nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews  by  ADB  staff,  the  individual  loan  agreements  extended \nduring the MFF period will include a requirement for a detailed midterm review for the respective \nthree subproject batches. Two months prior to the midterm review, the Government will submit to \nADB a detailed progress report on the progress of the Investment Program. Terms of reference \nfor the midterm review will be included in the MFF administration memorandum to be prepared by \nADB\u2019s inception mission for the Investment Program.  \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Analysis and Sustainability \n\n \nA. \n \n70. \nEconomic  analysis  was  performed  by  evaluating  subproject  investments  considering \ncapital and recurrent costs in addition to benefits derived from savings in road user costs and \npassenger time for the with- and without-project cases. The economic analysis was performed \nfor the initial 20 years of project operation. The main quantifiable benefits of the subprojects are \n(i) savings on vehicle operating costs and passenger time for existing and diverting traffic, and \n(ii)  savings  for  traffic  generated  by  improved  accessibility  and  distance  savings.  In  addition, \nsubregional benefits arise from improved connectivity and from upgrading the N50 to a through \nroute.  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nidentified \n\nThe  eight  subprojects \n\n \n71. \nfor  batches  1  and  2  support  reconstruction, \nimprovement,  and  increasing  the  capacity  of  some  836  km  of  national  highway.  Of  the  eight \nsubprojects identified,  batch  1  comprising  three  sample  subprojects with  combined  length  376 \nkm  has  been  evaluated.  The  three  include  (i)  the  southernmost  85  km  section  of  N25  (Hub\u2013\nUthal), complementing ADB\u2019s ongoing project on the northernmost section of the route (Kalat\u2013\nQuetta\u2013Chaman);  (ii)  255  km  of  the  key  east\u2013west  N50  (Khanozai\u2013Zhob)  currently  unsuitable \nfor  through  traffic,  necessitating  a  very  long  detour;  and  (iii)  construction  of  a  2-lane  dual \ncarriageway  for  36  km  of  N70  (Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh),  including  an  urgently  required \nMuzaffargarh bypass. The three sample subproject sections are part of important interprovincial \nroutes (i) Sindh\u2013Balochistan, (ii) NWFP\u2013Balochistan, and (iii) Punjab\u2013Balochistan, respectively. \nThey are also key subregional connectivity links (i) Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan and on to the Central \nAsian republics, (ii) Iran and Afghanistan to the People\u2019s Republic of China and India,; and (iii) \nIran and Afghanistan\u2013India. \n \n72. \nThe  economic  analysis  shows  that  the  three  subprojects  (batch  1)  are  viable,  with \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  of  (i)  N25\u201416.5%,  (ii)  N50\u201421.0%,  and  (iii)  N70\u201437.8%. \nTheir  direct  benefits  primarily  comprise  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  and  passenger  time \nsavings.  The  three  proposed  bypasses  (Muzaffargarh,  Muslimbagh,  and  Zhob)  will  provide \nmuch  needed  relief  for  local  communities  heavily  impacted  by  through  traffic.  During \nconstruction, employment opportunities will be created for thousands of workers and in the case \nof N50 in areas where little alternative employment is available, providing a substantial stimulus \nto  local  communities.  The  sample  three  subprojects  will  facilitate  marketing  of  agricultural \nproduce and improve people\u2019s access to social services in poverty areas, while also contributing \nto  regional  trade  between  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan.  Fruit  and  vegetable  distribution  from \npoverty-affected areas will be facilitated by the three subprojects. In the medium to long term, \nthe  three  routes  are  expected  to  play  leading  roles  as  subregional  connectors  and  trade \nfacilitators,  with  widespread  economic  benefits  for  Pakistan,  the  subregion,  and  central  Asia. \nAppendix 15 provides the economic analysis. \n \n73. \nThe financial sustainability of NHA and the NHDP was assessed by taking into account \nthe  financial  capacity  of  NHA  based  upon  past  Government  contributions  to  its  investment \nprogram  and  projected  Government  contributions.  NHA\u2019s  road  maintenance  program  is \nadequately covered by Government contributions and toll receipts from sections of the national \nhighway  network.  Overall,  NHA  is  able  to  maintain  financial  sustainability  of  the  Investment \nProgram. The financial management assessment reveals that NHA\u2019s overall system of financial \ninternal  control  is  reasonably  satisfactory.  However,  the  status  of  completion  of  auditing  of \nfinancial  accounts  is  behind  schedule.  NHA  has  agreed  with  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  to \nappoint external auditors to clear the backlog with clearance of 2003/04 financial accounts by 30 \nJanuary 2006. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n74. \nThe  overall  poverty  levels  in  Balochistan  and  Punjab  are  reported  at  39%  and  30% \nrespectively,  44%  and  34%  in  rural  areas  and  30%  and  24%  in  urban  areas  respectively. \nPoverty impact ratios were calculated by distributing vehicle operating costs and time benefits to \nbeneficiary groups and estimating the share of the poor in each group, based on survey data. \nThe  poverty  impact  ratios  of  the  batch  1  subprojects  (N25,  N50,  N70)  are  estimated  at  13%, \n32%, and 33% respectively. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Socioeconomic Impacts  \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n1. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n75. \nThe batch 1 subprojects will create significant employment opportunities for skilled and \nunskilled  labor  during  their  implementation.  Unskilled  labor  will  be  employed  directly  in  road \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and maintenance; and indirectly in providing materials and services \nfor contractors. The subprojects will generate approximately 26,000 person-months of unskilled \nlabor  employment,  generally  at  higher  wage  rates  than  otherwise  obtainable  in  the  local  job \nmarket. The N50 subproject will generate employment in areas where no other job opportunities \nexist.  The  subprojects\u2019  impact  on  poverty  will  be  enhanced  by  encouraging  contractors  to \nengage  local  workers  in  subproject  areas  and  to  provide  first  priority  to  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged during construction. Long distance traffic diverting to the N50 highway will bring \npassing  trade  and  tourism  to  some  of  the  most  disadvantaged  areas  of  the  country.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. Social analysis for the sample \nsubprojects revealed that the subprojects will contribute to better living standards for the poor, \ngenerate  off-farm  employment  opportunities,  reduce  commuting  times,  and  provide  improved \naccess to services (Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n\n2. \n\nGender \n\n \n76. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  benefit  women  by  providing  them  with  easier  access  to \nmarkets, better delivery of services, and improved access to better quality health care facilities \nand higher education. The Investment Program will ensure (i) civil work contracts include legally \nmandated  provisions  for  health;  sanitation;  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including \naccommodation,  where  appropriate, \nthe \nconstruction  period;  and  (ii)  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws, \nincluding elimination of gender-differentiated wages. People (men and women) directly affected \nby the subprojects will be given priority for employment. Contractors must not vary the wages of \nmen and women employed for work of equal value. A specific clause will be included in bidding \ndocuments,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during  implementation.  Potential  risks  of \n(HIV/AIDs)  and \nhuman \nwomen/children  trafficking  threats  may  be  aggravated  by  the  increased  connectivity  of  the \nproject areas. NHA will employ qualified domestic consultants under construction supervision to \naddress these issues through its mitigating measures. \n \n\nfor  construction  workers  at  campsites  during \n\nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \n\nimmunodeficiency  syndrome \n\n3. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Aspects \n\n \n77. \nThe subprojects are to be developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  construction  of  the  project  highways  will  largely \nfollow  the  alignment  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  Urban  congestion  points  are  being \nbypassed with new sections of road, for which land will have to be acquired. For the three batch \n1  subprojects  and  associated  bypasses  (N25,  N50,  and  N70),  a  full  census  for  resettlement \nplanning  was  conducted  of  all  the  affected  people,  land,  and  structures/assets  on the  right-of-\nway. In addition, a 20% socioeconomic sample survey was conducted. Batch 1 subprojects will \nrequire acquisition of approximately 105 hectares for the three national highways, and will likely \naffect about 606 households as a consequence of land acquisition. Widening and improvement \nwill affect 145 structures (100 shops or small business enterprises, 35 residential houses, and \n15  community  structures).  The  estimated  cost \nland  acquisition,  compensation, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  is  approximately  $16.40  million  equivalent.  A  summary \nresettlement  plan  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  The  entitlement  matrix  and  an \nannouncement  on  the  availability  of  the  resettlement  plan  in  local  and  regional  offices  was \npublished  in  the  local  newspaper  on  30  June  2005;  and  copies  of  the  resettlement  plan  were \nplaced  at  local/union  council  offices,  teshil  headquarters  offices,  government  schools,  Deputy \n\nfor \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nDistrict  Officer  Revenue\u2019s  offices  and  NHA's  regional  offices  at  Multan  and  Quetta.  NHA  will \ndistribute  the  summary  in  local  language  and  English  to  those  affected.  The  summary  will  be \nplaced on the ADB website after loan approval. The complete plan will be publicly available at \nNHA, and at ADB's Pakistan Resident Mission. Batch 2, comprising five subprojects, and batch \n3 subprojects will be designed using the criteria for the batch 1 three sample subprojects. The \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement20  for  preparing  the  Investment \nProgram necessitated the preparation of a resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I) \nfor  all  subprojects.  A  resettlement  plan  for  batch  2  and  3  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and \napproved by NHA and submitted to ADB for approval. \n\n \n4. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \nThe  batch  1  subproject  areas  are  each  characterized  by  distinct  population  groups, \n78. \nlanguages,  social  organizations,  and  cultures  that  comprise  their  respective  mainstream \npopulations. These populations are all integrated into the cultural and economic mainstreams of \ntheir respective regional, provincial, and federal structures. No separate disadvantaged groups \nthat  differ  from  the  dominant  local  population  are  likely  to  be  adversely  affected  by  the \nInvestment  Program.  Thus  preparation  of  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  is  not \nrequired.  Nonetheless,  the  Investment  Program  will  have  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system \nthat  monitors  adverse  impacts  on  potentially  vulnerable  groups  (households  living  below  the \nrecognized  poverty  line;  households  headed  by  women,  the  elderly,  the  disabled)  and  initiate \nmeasures to mitigate such adverse impacts through resettlement plans. \n \n\n5. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Measures \n\n \n79. \nAccording  to  the  World  Health  Organization  and  Joint  United  Nations  Program  on \nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Pakistan has a low prevalence but is a high-risk country for the spread of \nHIV  infection.  Considering  the  risk  of  possible  presence  of  laborers  not  from  the  immediate \nproject  area  for  road  construction  works  and  long-distance  truck  drivers,  NHA  will  employ \nqualified  domestic  consultants  as  part  of  the  construction  supervision  contracts  to  conduct  an \ninformation  and  education  campaign  on  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  women/children  trafficking, \ntargeting construction workers at campsites, truck drivers at truck stops, and local communities \nalong  project  highways,  particularly  rural  women.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  the \nrelevant district agencies and other existing networks dedicated to the prevention of HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking. \n \nC. \n \n80. \nThe overall Investment Program is classified as environment category \u201cA,\u201d however; the \nsubprojects  vary  as  \u201cB\u201d  and  \u201cA\u201d  type  activities.  The  environmental  impacts  of  the  batch  1 \nsubprojects  were  assessed  by  undertaking  an  initial  environmental  impact  assessment  for  (i) \nN25: Hub\u2013Uthal and N50: Kuchlak\u2013Zhob; and (ii) an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for \nN70: Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh. The first two subprojects involve the widening and improvement of \nthe existing road to 2-lane national standard road. The N70 subproject involves expanding the \nexisting  road  to  4-lane  national  standard  and  construction  of  an  approximately  15  km  bypass. \nThe studies found that the environmental impacts associated with these subprojects are mostly \nrelated  to  construction,  such  as  increased  dust,  noise,  volatile  gas  due  to  hot-mix  plants, \ndisruption of existing traffic movement, loss of roadside trees, and increased suspended solids \nin  the  water  bodies.  These  environmental  impacts  are  temporary  and  reversible,  and  the \nmitigation measures to minimize them are manageable. None of these subprojects will influence \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\necologically  sensitive  areas  or  will  impinge  on  cultural  or  archaeological  sites.  However,  the \nconstruction  of  a  new  bypass  as  part  of  N70  will  affect  a  number  of  private  properties,  and \ntherefore require land acquisition. \n \nAlthough  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  three  sample  subprojects  are \n81. \ninsignificant  and  manageable,  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nneeds  to  be  monitored  continuously,  and  the  semiannual  report  on  EMP  implementation \nsubmitted  to  ADB  and  relevant  Government  agencies.  NHA  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  and  its  updating,  as  well  as  for  implementing  the  environmental \nmonitoring  plan.  The  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  required  mitigation \nmeasures  during  construction.  Considering  the  wide  range  of  NHA\u2019s  responsibilities  in \naddressing  environmental  concerns  related  to  the  Investment  Program,  a  consultant  will  be \nhired  to  assist  NHA  in  (i)  ensuring  that  all  necessary  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  the \ncontract  document  for  civil  works,  (ii)  supervising  and  monitoring  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures  during  construction,  and (iii)  implementing  the  EMP,  environmental  monitoring  plan, \nand  environmental  assessment  review  procedure  framework.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultant are outlined in Supplementary Appendix E. The environmental impact assessment of \nbatch  2  and  3  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  reviewed  by  adopting  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  attached  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  The  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment incorporating the impact assessment studies for the batch 1 \nsample  subprojects  was  submitted  to  the  Board  and  disclosed  to  the  public  through  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  on  30  June  2005.    The  SEIA  was  circulated  with  title  PAK:  Proposed  Subregional \nTransport Connectivity (Pakistan) Sector Project and through ADB\u2019s website, the change in title \nwas informed to the public on 31 October 2005. \n \nD. \n \n82. \nTo  avoid  the  risk  of  the  Investment  Program  not  being  sustainable  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance, for each of the subproject road improvements, the Government will be required to \nenter into long-term operation and maintenance contracts, to be awarded to private contractors \non the basis of competition. Implementation progress for the provincial road projects has been \nslower than anticipated. For Punjab,21 the provincial government, after much delay in ensuring \ncompliance  of  bid  documents  and  evaluation  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures \nand guidelines, has finally appointed the project management consultants. For the Balochistan \nRoad  Project  (footnote  16  above),  implementation  is  progressing  satisfactorily  after  the \nrecruitment of project management consultants. Prequalification of civil works contractors have \nbeen  completed  and  bid  evaluation  is  in  progress;  civil  works  contracts  are  expected  to  be \nawarded  by  the  end  of  2005.  For  the  NWFP  Road  Project  (footnote  5  above),  subsequent  to \ninitial  delays  in  gaining  approval  of  the  Government\u2019s  project  pro  forma  document,  the \nrecruitment of the project management consultant and preparation of bid documents are at an \nadvanced stage; civil works are expected to commence by mid-2006. \n \n83. \nThe  risk  of  initial  implementation  delays  as  experienced  in  the  NWFP  project  is  being \naddressed by having NHA act as the executing agency for the Investment Program. NHA has \nsubstantial experience with implementing major national highways and motorway development \nprojects in all provinces, and has additional legal powers to support project land acquisition and \nresettlement.  For  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities,  delays  will  be  minimized  by \naugmenting  NHA\u2019s  capacity  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  by  providing  consulting \n\nInvestment Program Risks   \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB.  2002.

Due to the early appointment of the \nproject directors, advance work has commenced in preparation of land acquisition activities. The \nrisk of delays due to slow procurement activities is being addressed by (i) early ADB approval of \nbatch  1  subproject  documents  for  recruitment  of  project  supervision  consultants  and  bidding \ndocuments  for  civil  works,  (ii)  early  commencement  of  advance  recruitment  and  advance \nprocurement  actions,  (iv)  a  business  opportunities  seminar  for  international  contractors  to \npartake  in  civil  works  construction  of  batch  1  and  2  subprojects,  (iv)  two  dedicated  ADB \nworkshops  for  NHA  staff  on  ADB  procurement  procedures,  (v)  preparation  for  the  early \nrecruitment of a procurement adviser, and (vi) establishment of the project management offices \nand  appointment  of  the  principal  coordinating  officer  and  the  project  directors  for  the  batch  1 \nsubprojects.  In  addition,  NHA  has  obtained  internal  Central  Development  Working  Party \napproval of the project pro forma document, thereby ensuring early loan effectiveness. \n \n84. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  batch  1  sample  subprojects  suggests  no  significant \neconomic  risks.  Sensitivity  tests  and  risk  analysis  show  that  the  sample  subprojects  will  be \neconomically viable even under a combination of adverse scenarios. The risk of adverse social \nand  environmental  impacts  has  been  addressed  through  the  mitigation  measures  included  in \nthe resettlement plan, EIA, and EMP, and through associated conditions and assurances of the \nproject loans. For the Investment Program, the subprojects will be required to comply with the \neligibility criteria (Appendix 8) before becoming eligible for ADB financing. \n \n85. \nUse of a new financing modality, over the 10-year implementation period, poses a risk \nfor both Pakistan and ADB. ADB program teams must be on standby to offer advice and guide \nNHA on specific issues and problems pertaining to operations under the MFF. The Government \nand  NHA  are  providing  ADB  with  a  set  of  warranties  and  representations  on  these  fronts  and \nmay need real time support prior to making formal submission of PFRs under the MFF. ADB will \nhandle  this  requirement  in  two  ways.  Firstly,  it  will  strengthen  the  human  resources  of  its \nPakistan  Resident  Mission,  and  will  ensure  the  development  of  additional  capacity  in \nprocurement  and  safeguard  compliance  activities  in  the  resident  mission\u2019s  operations. \nSecondly, headquarters staff responsible for the Investment Program will utilize the processing \ntime  savings  to  supervise  and  monitor  the  Investment  Program.  This  is  clearly  one  of  the \nadvantages  of  the  MFF.  NHA  has  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  adhere  to  the  framework \nfacility  understandings,  but  from  time-to-time  the  parties  in  the  field  will  require  special \nassistance. ADB will position itself to give it. \n \n86. \nThe  fiduciary  risk  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  addressed  mainly  through  the \narrangements  made  in  the  areas  of  procurement,  accounting,  and  reporting.  Financial \nmanagement,  better  budgeting,  management  and  information  system  improvement,  and \nstrengthened financial planning will form part of the capacity-building program. The longer term \nobjective, however,  will be to leave in place systems, people, and procedures that can outlive \nthe Investment Program itself. The Government and NHA are especially keen on this approach \nand accordingly will work with ADB toward this endeavor. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n \n87. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nSubproject  Selection  Criteria  and  Approval  Process.  In  selecting  subprojects  to  be \n88. \nundertaken within the Investment Program, the criteria set forth in Appendix 8 will be adhered \nto. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n89. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  NHA  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  proceed  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement  (footnote  20),  as  well  as  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  and \nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  plan  for  batch  1  sample  subprojects  is  set  forth  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  H,  and  the  resettlement  framework  for  batch  2  and  batch  3 \nsubprojects is set forth in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nNHA will (i) prepare and implement resettlement plans, in accordance with ADB's policy \n90. \non  involuntary  resettlement  (footnote  20)  with  the  principles  and  procedures  laid  out  in  the \nresettlement  framework  and  agreed between  the  Government  and  ADB  prevailing  (ii)  disclose \nsubproject resettlement plans to affected people in a form and language easily comprehensible \nto  APs  prior  to  submission  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  award  of  the  related  civil \nworks  contracts  or  a  similar  milestone,  (iii)  monitor  and  submit  the  quarterly  progress  and \ncompletion reports on land acquisition and resettlement, (iv) appoint an independent monitoring \nexpert  prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities,  and  ensure  that \nreports are simultaneously submitted to NHA and ADB. \n \n91. \nThe  resettlement  budget  will  be  revised  based  on  any  new  data  collected,  and  any \nadditional  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  cost  that  may  be  required  will  be  borne  by  the \nBorrower.  If  there  is  any  change  in  the  scope  of  the  investment  program  subprojects,  the \nresettlement  plans  will  be  revised  and  submitted for  ADB  approval  prior  to  award of  civil  work \ncontracts. \n \nNHA will ensure that (i) compensation for land and structures will be provided to affected \n92. \npersons in full at replacement value including financial assistance/grants, if any, prior to taking \npossession  of  their  assets;  and  that  essential  public  infrastructure  affected  by  land  acquisition \nand resettlement are replaced appropriately and expeditiously; (ii) acquire or make available on \na  timely  basis  (i.e.,  strictly  in  accordance  with  the  schedule  as  agreed  under  the  related  civil \nworks  contract)  the  land  and  rights  in  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances;  and  (iii)  clear  the \nutilities,  trees,  and  any  other  obstruction  from  such  land,  on  a  timely  basis  (i.e.,  strictly  in \naccordance with the schedule as agreed under the related civil works contracts), as required for \nconstruction  activities  relating  to  each  section  of  the  related  civil  works  contract  under  the \nInvestment Program. \n \n93. \nEnvironment.  NHA  will  implement  mitigation  measures  and  the  EMP  for  the  batch  1  \nthree  sample  subprojects  as  described  in  the  initial  environmental  examination,  EIA,  and \nsummary  EIA  reports  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  environment  policies. \nNHA will implement the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework for the batch 2 and \nbatch 3 subprojects. \n \n94. \nNHA will obtain all necessary national and provincial environmental statutory clearances \nsuch  as  environmental  clearance,  forest  clearance,  and  nonobjection  certificates  prior  to \ncommencing any civil work. NHA shall ensure that all conditions attached to these clearances \nwill  be  implemented  and  monitored.  NHA  will  develop  and  implement  EMP  and  submit \nsemiannual reports to ADB and relevant agencies on the implementation of the EMP, conditions \nof  clearance  for  \u201cA\u201d  category  subprojects,  and  annual  reports  for  \u201cB\u201d  category  subprojects  as \npart of the progress report on investment program implementation. \n \n95. \nNHA  will  report  to  ADB  any  change  of  road  alignment  or  \u201cas  change\u201d  in  a  project \ncomponent that occurs after the EIA report was approved by ADB. ADB\u2019s prior approval will be \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nrequired  before  putting  into  effect  any  such  changes,  where  in  the  opinion  of  ADB,  additional \nenvironmental  assessment  will  be  made.  NHA  will  prepare  a  semiannual  report  on \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  as  part  of  the  progress  reports  on  investment  program \nimplementation.  NHA  will  provide  the  contractors  with  the  environmental  assessment  study \nreports including the EMP, and ensure that the contractors implement the mitigation measures \nand EMP as described in these reports. NHA will update the EMP for Muzaffargarh bypass as \npart  of  the  detail  engineering  work  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for  review  prior  to  commencing  civil \nworks. \n \n96. \nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking. NHA will ensure that civil works contracts under all \nthe  subprojects  incorporate  provisions  requiring  contractors  to  (i)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and \nwomen/children  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  programs  for  laborers;  (ii)  not employ  or \nuse  children  as  laborers;  and  (iii)  follow  and  implement  legally  mandated  provisions  on  labor \n(including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, sanitation, and working conditions. NHA will \nengage qualified locally based consultants under construction supervision contracts to carry out \nthe  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  component  as  agreed  with  ADB.  The  PIUs  will \nsupervise the consultants and work closely with Pakistan\u2019s National AIDS Control Program and \nother  networks  dedicated  to  preventing  sexually  transmitted  infections,  HIV/AIDS,  and \nwomen/children trafficking; and to the empowerment of women and children. \n \nRoad Maintenance. NHA will develop in consultation with ADB and have its executive \n97. \nboard approve a road maintenance plan for the fiscal years 2007/11 by 31 March 2007, which \nwill,  among  other  things,  provide  funding  modalities  to  finance  the  maintenance  of  relevant \nroads acceptable to ADB. \n \n98. \nJune 2007 or as agreed with ADB, an NTP, as endorsed by ADB, will have been promulgated. \n \nBy  30  June  2007,  NHA  will  have  established  a  fully  functional  road  safety  cell  within  it \n99. \nwith a mandate, among other things, (i) to analyze road safety risks and their consequences, (ii) \ndevelop recommendations for reduction of risks in existing and to be constructed roads, and (iii) \ndevelop a program for raising the awareness of the risk factors. The phrase \u201cfully functional\u201d in \nthe  preceding  sentence  will  mean  that  all  core  staff  for  the  road  safety  cell  will  have  been \nappointed and activities launched. The road safety cell will also have the capacity to undertake \nsafety audits of road designs as well as prepare work zone safety plans.  \n \n100.  NHA  will establish a policy formulation and coordination office as soon as possible but \nno later then 90 days after the date of loan effectiveness to provide guidance and monitor the \noverall implementation of the agreed policy reforms. \n \n101.  The Government will ensure that by 30 June 2007, an updated NHA Investment Plan for \nfiscal years 2007/11, to be prepared in consultation with ADB is approved. \n \n102. \nInvestment  Program  Management.  The  Government,  in  order  to  ensure  continuity, \ntransparency,  efficiency,  and  good  management,  will  cause  NHA  to  consult  with  ADB  on  all \nsignificant matters relating to management and implementation of the Investment Program. All \nmatters relating to selection or appointment, or any changes to such selection or appointment, \nof  any  project  director  or  deputy  project  director,  will  be  duly  notified  to  ADB  along  with  the \nqualifications of the incumbents and the departing officers and reasons for such changes. The \nappointment  of  a  project  director  or  deputy  project  director  cannot  be  terminated  or  terms  of \nsuch  appointment  altered  in  any  material  way  until  the  third  anniversary  of  such  appointment \n\nPolicy  Development  and  Investment  Plan.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  by  30 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nunless  a  determination  of  gross  dereliction  of  duty  or  such  other  serious  misconduct  is  made \nthrough due process. \n \n103.  To  provide  an  open  channel  for  registering  grievances  of  any  type  regarding  NHA\u2019s \nmanagement  of  the  Investment  Program,  a  dedicated  website  will  be  established.  Such  a \ndedicated website will be established to be available in English and Urdu, and provide an easy \nmethod  for  seeking  redress  of  grievances.  The  website  will  be  hosted  by  the  Vigilance \nCommittee.  The  Vigilance  Committee  will  keep  an  accurate  record  of  all  grievances  files  and \nresponses and other actions taken. The establishment of the website shall be widely publicized \nthrough all English and Urdu media. Each office of NHA and all offices of the NHA contractors \nwill prominently display information on the website and ways to use it. The Vigilance Committee \nwill report to the NHA Executive Board and to ADB every quarter on progress toward resolution \nof  grievances  filed  through  the  website  and  any  other  means.  The  website  will  be  maintained \nproperly and in the event of any failure to keep it functional for more than 7 consecutive days, \nADB will be promptly informed. \n \n104.  Capacity  Development.  The  Government  will  cause  NHA  to  accelerate  recruitment  of \nprofessional staff and reduce unfilled vacancies of approved posts as they stand on the date of \nloan effectiveness to no more than 10% of such approved posts for each department within 2 \nmonths of the loan effectiveness date, unless otherwise agreed with ADB, all posts of grade 16 \nand above will be considered professional posts for the purpose of this provision. \n \n105.  The  Government  will  cause  NHA  to  design,  develop,  and  adopt  a  comprehensive \ntraining program, including management training, for enhancement of skills of all newly recruited \nand other staff so that they meet at least the minimum levels of competencies required for their \npositions.  The  Human  Resources  Department  of  NHA  will  be  entrusted  to  undertake  the \nrequisite training needs analysis and based on such analysis a two-year- training calendar will \nbe  prepared  by  30  June  2006  or  as  agreed  with  ADB,  by  the  department  showing  the  scope, \nlength, and location of each training to be offered. An annual external evaluation of the training \nprogram will be carried out within 45 days of the training program of the calendar year. \n \n106. \nInstitutional Reform and Development. The Government will cause NHA to complete \nan institution reform program in consultation with ADB and begin execution of such plan by 30 \nJune 2007. ADB will be periodically consulted on progress and direction of all reforms initiated \nunder the aegis of this program. \n \n107.  The  Government  will  cause  NHA  to  prepare  and  install  in  consultation  with  ADB  a \nfinancial management system. Such financial management system will include key performance \nindicators and monitoring and reporting mechanisms. Within 9 months of the implementation of \nsuch financial management system, an external evaluation of its robustness will be carried out. \nThe  report  and  recommendations  of  the  external  evaluation  will  be  shared  with  ADB  and  the \nagreed recommendations will be duly adopted as promptly as possible. \n \n108.  Labor Laws. The Government will cause NHA to ensure that the civil works contractors \ncomply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  regulations  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  the \nconstruction activities. The Government will cause NHA to encourage civil works contractors to \nhire women and minorities, including Gypsies wherever possible. The Government will ensure \nthat  NHA  provides  equal  opportunity  for  women  for  road  construction  activities,  as  well  as \nrequires  contractors  to  not  differentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal \nvalue. The Government, through NHA, will ensure that a specific clause to this effect is included \nin all relevant bidding documents, and compliance is strictly monitored and documented during \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nInvestment  Program  implementation.  Recognizing  the  challenges  in  recruitment  of  women  for \nsuch employment, a reputable private organization will be appointed to independently monitor, \ndevelop suggestions and guidelines for improvement of performance in each of these areas and \non a quarterly basis, and report on all such matters to ADB through NHA. \n \n109.  Midterm  Reviews.  A  comprehensive  midterm  review,  the  timing  to  be  determined  in \nagreement with ADB and NHA for each batch of subprojects, will be undertaken jointly by ADB \nand NHA to review all aspects of project implementation, including procurement financing and \nscheduling matters. \n \n110.  Performance Audit. The Government will cause an annual performance audit for each \nof  the  subprojects  of  the  Investment  Program  to  be  completed  pursuant  to  the  terms  of \nreference  to  be  developed  by  ADB.  All  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  such  performance \naudits will be paid out of the Investment Program funds. \n\n \n111.  Condition  for  Effectiveness.  As  an  additional  condition  for  effectiveness  for  the  loan \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  the  first  ordinary  operations  loan  under  MFF  will  have \nbecome effective. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n112. \nI am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility and proposed loan would \ncomply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe  provision  of  loans  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  in  an  aggregate \nprincipal amount not exceeding $770,000,000 equivalent to the Islamic Republic \nof  Pakistan  for  the  National  Highway  Development  Sector  Investment  Program \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \nFramework Financing Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 2,080,000 to \nthe  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  National  Highway  Development  Sector \nInvestment  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per  annum,  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n     Joseph Eichenberger \n\n \n           Vice-President (Operations 2) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 November 2005 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n \n\nImpact  \n \n1.

Road transport is the \n1. \ndominant  mode,  accounting  for  91%  of  passenger  traffic  and  96%  of  freight  traffic.  Road \ntransport  services  are  largely  in  the  private  sector,  which  handles  some  95%  of  freight  traffic, \nand  is  subject  to  strong  competition.  During  the  1990s,  the  overall  demand  for  road  transport \ngrew at 7\u20138% per  year, compared  with average gross domestic product growth  of 4\u20135%. The \nnumber of registered motor vehicles in 2004 was 2.94 million (20 per 1,000 population), with a \nfurther 3.01 million motorcycles and rickshaws. The combined fleet is growing at 9% annually. \nThe  total  length  of  the  road  network  is  some  250,000  kilometers  (km),  60%  of  it  paved.  The \nnational  highway  network  comprises  about  8,320  km  of  national  highway  and  710  km  of \nmotorways, and carries 75\u201380% of commercial traffic. The main domestic artery is concentrated \nalong  the  1,670  km  Karachi\u2013Lahore\u2013Peshawar  corridor.  This  serves  80%  of  the  urban \npopulation  and  carries  over  55%  of  intercity  traffic.  A  detailed  condition  survey  carried  out  in \n2001  indicates  that  50%  of  the  national  highway  network  was  in  poor  to  very  poor  condition. \nSome  deteriorated  sections  are  located  on  important  interprovincial  and  subregional  routes \n(N25,  N50,  and  N70),  connecting  Pakistan  with  Afghanistan  and  providing  access  to  southern \nports. \n \n2. \nThe  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications  is \nresponsible for the operation, maintenance, and development of the national highway system. It \nis an autonomous highway agency with a functional structure and decentralized implementation \nthrough  regional  provincial  offices.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank \nhave provided assistance1 to reorganize and commercialize NHA, shifting its focus to a network \noperator and service provider role and strengthening financial management systems to improve \ngovernance.  However,  NHA  has  internal  capacity  constraints,  such  as  limited  in-house \ncapability  in  strategic  planning,  project  and  asset  management,  and  network  operation.  NHA, \nunder the World Bank-financed National Highway Improvement Project, is incorporating on an \ninstitutional  basis  the  use  of  modern  road  asset  management  and  maintenance  systems \n(including  HDM-4)  for  operation  and  maintenance  and  integrating  them  in  day-to-day \noperations. \n \n3. \nIn  the  past  NHA  suffered  from  poorly  justified  investments,  began  too  many  new \nprojects,  and  did  not  pay  sufficient  attention  to  network  conservation.  The  situation  led  to  the \ndeterioration  of  road  conditions  along  some  of  the  more  heavily  trafficked  highway  sections, \ncaused project delays, increased project costs, and reduced the headroom for new high-priority \ninitiatives  as  well  as  conservation  of  the  network.  Encouraged  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank, \nNHA  has  reprioritized  and  reprogrammed  the  investment  program  with  more  attention  and \nresources for conserving the national highway network. Thus, the federal Government and NHA \nhave  initiated  a  five-year  PRs138  billion  National  Highway  Development  Plan  covering \nrehabilitation, resurfacing, and improvement of some 9,000 km of the national highway network, \nbased on a condition survey and a network-level prioritization study. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Road Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan 1891-PAK approved on 19 \nDecember 2001 for $50 million) and World Bank-financed Highway Rehabilitation Project. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nNational Highway Revenues and Expenditures \n\nB. \n \n4. \nThe NHA Act of 1991 permits NHA to receive funds from various sources including loans \nand  grants  from  the  federal  Government;  income  from  tolls;  foreign  aid;  grants  and  other \nreceipts (lease money, fees, rentals, fines, etc.); as well as funds from floating bonds, shares, \netc.  At  present,  the  bulk  of  NHA\u2019s  receipts  come  as  budgetary  allocations  from  the  federal \ngovernment. These are received as (i) cash development loans from the Ministry of Finance for \nthe  Public  Sector  Development  Program  to  fund  capital  development,  (ii)  annual  maintenance \ngrants  from  the  Ministry  of  Communications  to  fund  operation  and  maintenance  expenditures, \nand  (iii)  annual  establishment  grants  from  the  Ministry  of  Communications  to  cover  NHA \nestablishment costs (Table A2.1). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of NHA Annual Allocations and Expenditures by Category \n(PRs million) \n2003/04\n19,254\n17,347\n825\n32\n1,050\n\nFiscal Year \nTotal Expenditures \nConstruction (PSDP) \nMaintenance \nEstablishment Charges \nForeign Loans Repayment \n \nMaintenance as % of Total \nExpenditures \nNHA = National Highway Authority, PSDP = public sector development project. \na Budget estimates. \nSource: National Highway Authority. \n\n2005/06a \n21,244 \n15,963 \n1,200 \n44 \n4,037 \n \n5.6 \n\n2004/05\n18,059\n14,382\n900\n39\n2,738\n\n4.9\n\n4.2\n\n \n\n \n5. \nRecently,  NHA  has  increased  its  direct  revenue  as  a  result  of  the  introduced  fee-for-\nservice concept. This has been achieved by expanding its toll network, revising toll rates, and \npromoting  commercial  use  of  its  rights-of-way.  Net  revenues  from  toll  collections  and \ncommercial use of right-of-way are credited to a dedicated road maintenance account, plus the \nannual  Government  maintenance  grant.  NHA  is  committed  to  periodically  reviewing  and \nmodifying the structure and level of its road user charges to reflect the (i) extent of road use, (ii) \ndamage  caused  to  the  road  network  by  individual  vehicle  categories,  and  (iii)  level  of  service \nprovided. A summary of NHA direct receipts is shown in Table A2.2. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Summary of NHA Receipts \n(PRs million) \n\nFiscal Year \nGross Toll Revenue \nCollection and Operation Charges \nNet Toll Revenue \nOther Receipts \nTotal Deployable Revenue \nNHA = National Highway Authority. \nSource: National Highway Authority. \n\n2003/04\n3,358\n993\n2,365\n790\n3,155\n\n2004/05 \n3,679 \n1,086 \n2,593 \n868 \n3,461 \n\n \n6. \nThe financial management assessment undertaken revealed that NHA\u2019s overall system \nof  financial  internal  control  is  reasonably  satisfactory.  However,  the  status  of  completion  of \nauditing  of  financial  accounts  is  behind  schedule.  NHA  has  agreed  with  the  World  Bank  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35\n\nSubregional Connectivity \n\nADB  to  appoint  external  auditors  to  clear  the  backlog  with  clearance  of  2003/04  financial \naccounts by 30 January 2006. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nPakistan\u2019s location makes it ideally placed to act as a hub for subregional transport and \nto take advantage of the subregion\u2019s rapidly improving political situation for the development of \ntransit and cross-border trade and commerce. Pakistan\u2019s road corridors offer the shortest route \nto the sea by several hundred km for landlocked Afghanistan, Central Asia, Xinjiang province of \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  for  parts  of  the  Russian  Federation.  Moreover,  Pakistan \nhas  traditionally  been  the  bridge  between  east  and  west  Asia;  the  recent  improvement  of \nrelations  with  India  and  the  opening  of  new  transport  links  open  up  the  eventual  possibility  of \nIran/Afghanistan\u2013India  links  through  Pakistan,  in  addition  to  a  wealth  of  cross-border \nopportunities. However, physical, institutional, and other constraints currently prevent Pakistan \nfrom  taking  full  advantage  of  its  location.  The  potential  for  increased  trade  through  improved \ntrade facilitation, rehabilitated transport links, efficient cross-border movements, and increased \nefficiency  at  ports  is  highly  significant  for  the  economy.  Pakistan  has  an  opportunity  to  play  a \ncatalytic  role  in  the  development  of  such  transport  initiatives,  thereby  enhancing  subregional \ncooperation in addition to promoting its domestic development. \n \nA  period  of  substantial  progress  in  subregional  cooperation  expected.  For  example  in \n8. \n2005 alone (i) Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to increase the number of border crossing \npoints  and  to  begin  operating  a  number  of  cross-border  bus  services;  (ii)  Pakistan  and  India \nhave  agreed  to  the  operation  of  bus  services  in  Kashmir  and  to  reopening  cross-border  rail \nlinks;  and  (iii)  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  has  agreed  to  support  the  further  deepening  of \nGwadar  port.  All  the  countries  in  the  subregion  have  expressed  a  political  commitment  to \nimproved trading links. Rapidly expanding national economies will provide further impetus to this \nprocess. \n\n9. \nClearly,  deepening  subregional  cooperation  is  a  continuous  process  involving  many \nstakeholders and not all the interests concerned necessarily support the process. Nevertheless, \nimproving  transport  links  and  facilitating  border  crossing  is  an  essential  prerequisite  and \nprovides a catalyst for improving other aspects. With the evident political goodwill in place and \ngrowing  pressure  from  consumers  in  the  subregion  for  improved  access  to  international \nmarkets, the stage is set for a transformation in the trading pattern, with particularly beneficial \nprospects for Pakistan. \n\nRoad Sector Issues \n\n \nD. \n \n10. \nDefinition  of  National  Highway  Network.  The  national  highway  network  currently \nexcludes  many  routes  whose  primary  purpose  is  interprovincial.  NHA  and  the  provinces  have \nproposed  routes  for  conversion  to  national  highways  (federalizing),  but  the  process  is \nconstrained  by  administrative  and  budget  issues.  A  redefinition  of  the  network  is  required, \nidentifying key national corridors and accelerating federalization to optimize road investment.  \n \n11. \nRoad  Infrastructure  and  Maintenance.  Based  on  assessments  of  road  conditions, \nabout  half  of  the  national  highway  network  and  a  large  proportion  of  the  provincial  road \nnetworks  are  in  poor  condition.  Deterioration  levels  on  provincial  roads  are  relatively  severe \ncompared  with  those  on  national  highways.  The  Government  has  initiated  a  program  for \nrehabilitating priority highway sections with assistance from the World Bank and ADB in addition \nto  Government  resources.  For  the  provincial  highways  and  district  roads,  ADB  is  financing \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nsequenced interventions in each province to rehabilitate and improve road networks. To ensure \nsustainability, these projects also support policy and institutional reforms and capacity building \nfor  the  road  agencies.  NHA  receives  Government  resources  that  are  supplemented  by  toll \nrevenues.  NHA\u2019s  road  maintenance  fund,  established  in  2000,  is  financed  by  Government \ngrants and through increasing toll revenues as the tolling operations are expanded throughout \nthe  national  highway  network.  Annual  revenues  collected  in  2004/2005  were  about  PRs3.6 \nbillion.  \n \nNHA  recognizes  that  increasingly  greater  emphasis  and  more  spending  on  road \n12. \nmaintenance will be necessary to preserve the national road infrastructure asset base. NHA has \nincreased its spending on routine and periodic road maintenance; government grants for routine \nmaintenance increased from PRs825 million in FY2003/04 to PRs900 million in FY2004/05, but \nfurther increases are necessary to reduce the backlog of maintenance. Latest estimates place \nthe  annual  maintenance  requirement  to  be  approximately  PRs6.3  billion.  In  addition  to  the \nannual  government  maintenance  grants,  NHA  receives  toll  receipts  and  other  sundry  revenue \nfrom ROW activities which substantially covers the major maintenance programs. Maintenance \nis increasingly being contracted out to private civil works contractors. The ongoing expansion of \nthe  road  network,  growth  in  traffic  volume,  and  increase  of  the  road  asset  base  indicate  that \nincreases in budget allocations for maintenance will be required. \n \nVehicle  Overloading.  Vehicle  overloading  is  a  major  cause  of  premature  pavement \n13. \ndeterioration  and  an  impediment  to  the  sustainable  development  of  the  highway  network. \nOverloading reduces the economic benefits of road projects and increases maintenance costs. \nA  study  by  the  National  Transport  Research  Center2  has  shown  that  some  43%  of  vehicles \nexceed the legal 12-ton axle-load limit mandated by the Road Safety Act 2000. Two-axle trucks \ncontribute  most  to  overloading,  which  is  increasing  at  about  2.6%  annually.  Although  the \nproportion  of  two-axle  trucks  in  the  fleet  is  declining,  they  still  account  for  over  50%  of  truck \ntraffic. To prevent pavement damage, overloaded vehicles need to be monitored and axle-load \ncontrol enforced by weigh stations using static and weigh-in-motion measuring devices. NHA is \nimplementing a nationwide axle-load program with 30 weighbridges on national highways. The \nenforcement of rules needs to be strengthened. \n \nRoad Safety. Road traffic accidents result in over 10,000 fatalities per year (over 30 per \n14. \n10,000  vehicles)  and  150,000  injuries,  high  levels  compared  with  Southeast  Asia,  although \nbetter than in Bangladesh and India.3 Road improvements increase the risk of severe accidents \ndue  to  speeding.  Without  road  safety  initiatives,  accidents  will  increase.  Economic  losses  are \nestimated  at  over  2%  of  gross  domestic  product,  although  no  centralized  data  collection  and \nanalysis  of  provincial  traffic  accidents  and  deaths  is  available.  Accidents  result  from  high \nspeeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor  discipline  and  enforcement  of  rules,  and  poor \ncondition  of  vehicles.  Road  safety  audits  are  not  conducted  routinely  for  new  and  improved \nroads.  The  road  safety  problem  is  exacerbated  by  lack  of  awareness  and  poor  knowledge  of \nroad  safety  matters  among  the  general  public  and  road  users.  National  and  provincial  efforts \nand  coordination  are  not  concerted,  and  responsibilities  and  accountability  among  the \ninstitutions and provincial departments are unclear. Extensive efforts in education and training of \ndrivers,  coupled  with  awareness  building,  are  required  to  address  the  high  fatality  rate.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Highway  Safety  Ordinance  (September  2000)  provides  the  legal  basis \n                                                 \n2  National Transport Research Center. 1994. Axle-Load Survey. Islamabad. \n3  Pakistan had 18.69 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 1992. This was lower than those for Bangladesh (85.58) and \nIndia  (25.27)  but  higher  than  those  for  Southeast  Asia  (5\u201315  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles)  and  far  above  the \ncountries with the lowest number of fatalities, such as the United Kingdom (1.60) and Japan (1.74).

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37\n\nfor establishing the National Highway and Motorway Police (NHMP) under the federal Ministry \nof Communications. This measure expands the role of the very successful motorway police to \nthe national highway system, in a phased manner.   \n \nTo  date,  road  safety  initiatives  have  been  confined  to  the  motorways  and  national \n15. \nhighways.  Preliminary  information  from  initiatives  taken  by  NHMP  shows  that  enforcement \ncoupled with engineering improvements and vehicle monitoring has significantly reduced traffic \naccidents  and  deaths. NHMP  has  successfully  installed systems  to  improve  road  safety  along \nthe motorways (412 km) and national highway N5 (1,760 km) in phases. NHMP services along \nthe  motorways  include  ambulances  with  paramedics,  mobile  workshops  with  mechanics, \nemergency telephones along the road, and briefing to commuters at entry points of motorways. \nThey use modern traffic enforcement and emergency relief equipment such as laser guns, video \nradar, video cameras, rescue vans, and emergency signboards. Through effective training and \nproactive  organizational  reforms,  NHMP  has  been  able  to  achieve  a  highly  motivated  and \ndedicated team of officers at each patrol post, commanded by a chief patrol officer. The officers \nregister violations without actually disturbing traffic as the documents and fines are not collected \nat  the  site.  The  successful  performance  of  NHMP  has  been  recognized  and  the  plan  is  to \nexpand its operations to cover the entire national highway network. \n \n16. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  A  large  investment  in  road  infrastructure  is  needed  to \nreduce  poverty  and \nsupport  accelerating  economic  growth,  which \nunemployment. The existing resource base is inadequate to meet the road development needs, \nand  private  sector  investment  will  be  necessary  to  fill  the  resource  gap.  Although  several \ninitiatives, mostly at the national level, have been taken to attract private sector investments in \nthe  road  sector,  few  were  successful  primarily  because  of  lack  of  (i)  an  enunciated  policy  on \nprivate  sector  participation,  (ii)  appropriate \ninstitutional  structures  and  processes,  (iii) \nestablished  systems  and  procedures,  and  (iv)  capable  staff.  The  capacity  to  promote \ninfrastructure  projects  is  limited.  In  addition,  lack  of  financial  expertise  leads  to  difficulties  in \npackaging  projects  that  could  be  successfully  offered  for  private  sector  financing.  ADB  is \nproviding  technical  assistance  for  preparing  a  public-private  infrastructure  financing  facility4  to \nhelp design appropriate mechanisms for accelerating infrastructure development by increasing \nprivate  sector  participation.  Private  investors  have  approached  provincial  authorities  about \ninvesting  in  road  development,  but  lack  of  policies  and  an  enabling  environment  are  major \nimpediments. As part of policy reform and the institutional strengthening component, assistance \nneeds to be provided to overcome barriers to private sector participation in road development. \n \nThe role of  the private  sector in road contracting and providing engineering services is \n17. \nfairly  well  developed.  This  could  be  increased  by  contracting  out  maintenance  and  gradually \nintroducing  network  management  and  performance-based  contracts  for  maintenance.  NHA  is \npursuing  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation  in  road  infrastructure  projects.  Projects \ninclude the Lahore and Karachi bypasses, which are being prepared on a build-operate-transfer \nbasis. NHA needs, however, to step up its efforts to increase private sector participation. \n\nis  necessary \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2004.

The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  will \nensure that the detailed subproject report will be prepared within no more than 5 \nmonths  of  subproject  approval.  A  road  safety  audit  will  be  conducted  during \nproject design. \n\nThe  subprojects  will  be  economically  feasible  and  financially  sustainable,  and \ntheir  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  equal  to  or  higher  than  12%, \nbased  on  the  economic  analysis  to  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). \n\nEnvironmental  screening  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003) will be conducted for all subprojects. The subprojects will not \npass through or be within or less than 1 kilometer (km) from protected areas as \ndesignated by the Government, including sanctuaries or national parks. For each \nsubproject,  an  environmental  assessment  report  will  be  prepared,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan, \nthe  environmental \nassessment and review framework. \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n(v)  \n\nThe  subprojects  will  be  socially  sound  and  include  measures  to  mitigate  any \npossible  social  impacts.  For  each  subproject,  an  initial  poverty  and  social \nassessment  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  Initial \nPoverty and Social Assessment. \n\n(vi)   Resettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \n\nresettlement framework and ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. \n\n(vii)  \n\nIf  any  indigenous  peoples  or  scheduled  tribes  are  likely  to  be  affected \nsignificantly by a subproject, an indigenous people's development plan or special \naction will be prepared following the measures set forth in the indigenous people \ndevelopment framework. \n\n(viii)   All necessary federal and provincial government approvals will be obtained. \n\n(ix)  \n\nSufficient  Government  counterpart  funding  will  be  allocated  to  implement  the \nsubprojects. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n \np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4\n3\n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nProcedures \n\nB.  \n \n2.  \n \n\nEach subproject will be prepared and processed in accordance the following procedures: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)  \n\nA  feasibility  study  for  subprojects  will  be  conducted  by  consultants  engaged  by \nNHA,  who  will  fill  out  checklists  for  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  indigenous  people,  and  environmental  screening. \nThese documents will be sent for review to ADB, which may require revisions. \n \nUpon completion of the detailed design, NHA will prepare and submit to ADB a \nsummary  appraisal  report  for  each  subproject,  together  with  the  required \nattachments, including a resettlement plan, environmental assessment, summary \npoverty reduction and social strategies, and indigenous people development plan \nor special action if required. \n \n\n(iii)   NHA will translate into the local language each subproject resettlement plan and \ndisclose it to the affected people before submitting it to ADB. NHA will revise the \nresettlement plan if required, based on comments from the affected people and \nADB. \n \n\n(iv)   NHA  will  disclose  each  subproject  summary  environmental  assessment  for  \u201cA\u201d \n\n(v)  \n\ncategory projects to the public 120 days before submitting it to ADB. \n \nADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  reports,  together  with  the  required \nattachments.  If  it  finds  that  the  subproject  does  not  satisfy  eligibility  criteria  and \nprocedures,  or  does  not  comply  with  ADB's  policies,  ADB  may  advise  NHA  to \nmodify  the  subprojects.  In  addition,  NHA  will  prepare  draft  pro  forma  (PC1) \nreports and simultaneously forward them with the appraisal reports to ADB. \n\nOrganizational Arrangements \n\nNHA  will  appraise  the  subprojects,  while  ADB  will  advise  NHA  to  comply  with  the \n\n \n3.  \nBased  on  ADB's  approval,  and  subject  to  any  modification  and  remedial  measures \nrequired by ADB, NHA will implement the subprojects. NHA will ensure that ADB has access to \nall  documents  related  to  the  subproject  proposals  and  approval  process.  These  documents \nshould be kept for 5 years after approval. \n \nC.  \n \n4.  \neligibility criteria and procedures and to follow other relevant policies. \n \n5.  \nThe  project  management  office,  assisted  by  the  technical  audit  team  (formed  from \nexperts within the project management office and NHA) will process the subprojects for quality \ncontrol  of  subproject  preparation  and  contract  implementation.  This  team  will  review  and \nexamine  all \nfeasibility  studies,  preliminary  design  reports, \nenvironmental  assessment  reports,  resettlement  plans,  and  detailed  design  reports,  to  ensure \nthat Government and ADB requirements are fully met.  \n \n6.  \nThe  technical  audit  team  will  evaluate  the  viability  of  each  subproject  and  prepare  a \nsummary appraisal report to be submitted to ADB for approval.

Project  implementation  costs  were \ndeveloped  by  the  design  consultants,  applying  2005  unit  rates  for  labor  and  materials.  An \nimplementation period of 2\u20133 years was assumed, varying by subproject. Maintenance costs \nwere based on current NHA data, as given in Table A15.6. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15            \n\n53\n\nTable A15.6: Maintenance Costs  \n(PRs/square meter) \n \n\nOperation \n\nEdge Repair \n\nPatching \n\nCrack Sealing  \n\nOverlay 50 millimeter \nSource: Zeeruk Engineering Associates. \n\nFinancial  Economic \n\n200.0\n\n179.0\n\n12.0\n\n360.0\n\n170.0 \n\n152.0 \n\n10.0 \n\n306.0 \n\nBenefits \n\n8. \nFinancial costs, including taxes and duties, have been converted into economic costs \nusing an average conversion factor of 0.87, with the exception of unskilled labor for which a \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.7 has been applied, as used in similar studies in Pakistan. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe  main  quantifiable benefits  of  the  subproject  investments  are  (i)  vehicle operating \ncost savings for existing traffic, and (ii) time savings for existing passengers; and for N50 (i) \nbenefits to generated traffic and (ii) benefits to diverted traffic. The benefits to generated traffic \nare  assumed  to  be  half  those  for  normal  traffic.  The  value  of  time  was  taken  as  25%  of  the \naverage  hourly  wage  rate.  Vehicle  operating  cost  benefits  are  conditional  on  adequate \nmaintenance  of  the  project  roads  over  the  study  period.  NHA  developed  a  computerized \nmaintenance database of the national highway network in 2005, based on condition surveys. \nA  large  increase  in  maintenance  expenditure  is  planned  and  future  maintenance  will  be \nprogrammed  to  achieve  specific  roughness  targets.  Time  savings  based  on  differences  in \noperating speeds between the with- and without-project cases are escalated over the analysis \nperiod  by  the  forecast  increase  in  real  per  capita  income.  Generated  and  diverted  traffic  is \nparticularly  significant  for  N50,  which  with  the  project  will  become  the  through  route  for \nBalochistan\u2013Punjab/North-West Frontier Province traffic, avoiding a lengthy detour. The large \ndistance savings achieved will also benefit subregional traffic from Afghanistan and Iran to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India.  \n \nE. \n \n10. \nanalysis and sensitivity tests for changes in key input values are given in Tables A15.7  \n\nEconomic  Evaluation  and  Sensitivity  Analysis.

Increased trade with neighboring countries, facilitated among other means through highways, \ncontributes to macroeconomic stability and reduced risks of shocks for the vulnerable poor.   \n \nThrough  consultations  with  local  communities  during  poverty  reduction  strategy  formulation,  improved \nconnectivity and access to markets through the provision of rural roads emerged as a key area and major \npriority  for  the  poor;  the  provision  of  electricity  was  another.  Rural  urban  linkages  promoted  through \nimprovements  in  highways  and  roads  contribute  to  supporting  greater  stability  of  income  and  increased \nnonfarm  employment  in  rural  areas  where  the  majority  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  and  the  poor  reside.  In \nsupport  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  ADB  recognizes  the  potential  of  Pakistan\u2019s \ncomplementarity  in  resources  and  markets  to  its  neighbors,  and  the  potential  to  be  gained  from \nsubregional  cooperation  through  development  of  transportation  links.  Transportation  is  expected  to \ncontribute to macroeconomic growth and increase revenue to the national exchequer and indirectly lead to \nan increase in social spending that benefits the poor, who have a disproportionate interest in public social \nspending.  In  addition,  improved  accessibility  helps  reduce  the  urban  rural  gap  and  leads  to  increased \neconomic  activity  generating  off-farm  employment  for  the  poor.  Yet  macroeconomic  growth  in  Pakistan \ndoes not necessarily translate into reducing the social gap.1 \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nPoverty Classification : General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe number of poor2 in Pakistan has more than doubled in the 1990s, increasing to 45 million in 1999, of \nwhich 33 million or 73% (4.7 million households) are estimated to live in rural areas. Moreover, Pakistan \nranks  poorly  in  major  social  indicators:  infant  mortality  in  rural  areas  is  106  per  1,000  live  births; \nmalnutrition  of  children  under  5  is  39%.  An  important  feature  of  poverty  in  Pakistan  is  the  clustering  of \nincomes  around  the  poverty  line,  as  40.5%  of  the  nation\u2019s  population  falls  in  a  narrow  income  range \naround this line. Approximately 12.2% of the total population may be classed as chronically or extremely \npoor. According to Social Policy Development Center assessment in the 1990s over a 10-year period the \ndisposable income of the top income quintile grew in real terms by 23%, while that of the lowest quintile \ngrew  by  3%,  increasing  the  gap  between  the  rich  and  the  poor.3  Factors  that affect  the  livelihood  of  the \npoor include (i) low literacy; (ii) lack of access to appropriate technologies, government extension services, \noff-farm  employment  opportunities,  and  formal  credit;  (iii)  social  exclusion;  (iv)  gender  discrimination;  (v) \nexclusion from benefit of development projects; and (vi) poor service delivery.  \n \nParticipatory  rural  appraisals  (average  200  households  in  each  sample  subproject  areas)  conducted \nduring social assessment surveys of the three sample subproject areas revealed that 50% of people in the \ncatchments around the Hub\u2013Uthal section of N25 live below the poverty line, as do 20% living around the \nMultan\u2013Muzzafargarh  sections  of  N70  and  30%  of  those  in  the  communities  around  the  Kuchlak\u2013Zhob \nsection  of  N50.  During  the  participatory  rural  appraisal,  the  majority  of  the  primary  stakeholders \nacknowledged the positive impacts of the various elements of the project especially (i) the benefits due to \nbetter  accessibility  of  social  services  and  market  places;  and  (ii)  improved  local  employment  prospects \nduring  project  construction.  The  sample  subprojects  will  create  significant  employment  opportunities  for \nskilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  implementation.  Unskilled  labor  will  be  employed  directly  in  road \nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance,  and  indirectly  in  providing  materials  and  services  for \ncontractors. The sample subprojects will generate approximately 26,000 person-months of unskilled labor \n\n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2002. Pakistan - Poverty Assessment. Washington DC. \n2   The official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories/day/adult, equivalent to Rs750 per month in 2002-PRSP.  \nThis was calculated at prices of 2000\u20132001.  Estimated inflationary changes at prices of 2004 raise it to Rs850 \nper adult equivalent per month (Economic Survey of Pakistan 2004).  \n\n3  Social Policy Development Center Annual Report 2001. \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n55\n\nemployment,  generally  at  higher  wage  rates  than  otherwise  obtainable  in  the  local  job  market.  The  N50 \nsubproject  will  generate  employment  in  areas  where  no  other  job  opportunities  exist.  The  subprojects\u2019 \nimpact  on  poverty  will  be  enhanced  by  encouraging  contractors  to  engage  local  workers  in  subproject \nareas and to provide first priority to the poor and disadvantaged during construction. Long distance traffic \ndiverting to the N50 will bring passing trade and tourism to some of the most disadvantaged areas of the \ncountry. The poverty impact ratios of the sample subprojects (N25, N50, N70) are estimated at 13, 32, and \n33% respectively. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n No \n No \n\n Yes \n Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nParticipation,  consultation,  and  information  dissemination  were  incorporated  at  several  levels  during \nplanning  of  the  three  sample  subprojects  while  (i)  conducting  poverty  and  social  assessments  in \ncommunities of proposed road catchments and in the immediate corridor of impact; (ii) validating principles \non which entitlements for compensation and compensation levels specified in the entitlement matrix for the \nproject  are  based;  (iii)  forming  committees  of  people  affected  during  the  census  surveys;  and  (iv) \nminimizing  adverse  impacts,  exploring  alternate  alignments,  and  restricting  design  to  adjust  to  available \nspace. \nThe  National Highway Authority (NHA)  will  ensure that  essential  participation focuses  will  be adhered to \nduring  implementation  that  will  involve  local  groups  in  (i)  preparing  final  compensation  listings  and \nindividual  claim  files  and  in  the  payment  of  compensation  for  acquired  land  and  loss  of  assets  and \nlivelihood; (ii) consultation with displaced APs and host communities on relocation options, if relocation is \nnecessary;  (iii)  AP\u2019s  and  Citizens  Liaison  Committees  (ACLC)  that  will  also  include  representatives  from \nNHA  and  serve  as  liaison  with  the  Project  for  compensation  matters,  technical  design  and  construction \nissues  and  participate  in  any  grievance  redress;  and  (iv)  the  M&E  process  during  implementation  of  the \nResettlement Plan.  \n  \nD.  Gender And Development \n\nWomen will be able to benefit from the Project through improved access to basic services such as health, \neducation and clean water. Additional assistance to female headed households will be provided as part of \nthe  resettlement  plan.  There are  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDs  and  women/children  trafficking  threats \nthat may  be  aggravated by  the  increased  connectivity of  the  project  areas, however  the  project  aims  to \naddress these issues through its' mitigating measures. \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \nE.
