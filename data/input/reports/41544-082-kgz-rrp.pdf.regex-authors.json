THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Investment  Climate \nImprovement  Program.1 The  report  also  describes  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  preparing \nsubprogram 3 of the Investment Climate Improvement Program, and if the Board approves the \nproposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.2 \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  With almost a third of its 5.6 million people living in poverty, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \neconomic growth  and  investment  have  been  low  and  unstable.  Growth  of gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) averaged 4.1% since 2002, fluctuating from \u20131.4% to 8.5%. Gross fixed capital \nformation increased from 16.4% of GDP in 2005 to 25.3% in 2011, but its growth was volatile. \nThe country has attracted foreign investment, but mainly in gold mining, which generates little \nemployment. The official unemployment rate was 7.8% in 2011, but actual unemployment may \nbe much higher. Low growth rates and economic instability were mainly caused by weaknesses \nin  the  business  environment,  combined  with  internal  and  external  shocks.  These  included \npolitical turmoil in 2005 and 2010,3 and spillover from the global crisis in 2008\u20132009, mainly \nthrough Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. Insufficient economic diversification makes \nthe economy of the Kyrgyz Republic particularly vulnerable to shocks. \n3.  With the investment climate and despite past reforms, private enterprises still suffer from \nexcessive regulatory and licensing requirements, pervasive inspections by various enforcement \nagencies, complex and arbitrary taxation, and cross-border trade barriers such as complex pre-\ncustoms clearance. These, with the room for corruption and fraud they create,4 constrain most \nprivate enterprises, especially women entrepreneurs\u2019 smaller businesses. Remaining policy, \nlegal, and regulatory issues restrict access to finance, particularly for micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises and women entrepreneurs, who frequently have little collateral to offer for \ncultural reasons. Inadequate worker skills are an increasingly pressing issue, as the education \nsystem  responds  poorly  to  changing  market  needs  and  many  qualified  workers  seek \nemployment abroad. Labor migrants\u2019 remittances reached 25% of GDP in 2010, but they fuel \nconsumption rather than investment and increase imports, as the weak business environment \nprevents many enterprises from positively responding to demand by increasing production and \nemployment.  Finally,  weaknesses  in  the  education  and  health  systems  and  inadequate \ninfrastructure  in  other  sectors  frequently  result  from  underinvestment.  A  weak  enabling \nenvironment has been preventing private investment in these areas. Due to fiscal weakness, the \nKyrgyz Republic is in particular need of such investment.  \n4.  There is broad consensus that the long-term development prospects of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic depend on its ability to improve its investment climate to develop a vibrant private \nsector,  diversify  the  economy,  and  expand  markets.  This  would  make  the  economy  more \nresilient, promote long-term growth, create additional employment, and help reduce poverty. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The TA will be cofinanced on a grant basis by (i) ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV); and (ii) the \nFinancial Sector Development Partnership Fund, administered by ADB. \n3  In March 2005, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s longtime President Askar Akaev was ousted through the \u201cTulip Revolution\u201d. \nIn April 2010, a popular uprising toppled the regime of President Kurmanbek Bakiev. Internal ethnic conflict in June \n2010 exacerbated the already difficult political and economic situation. \n4  The Kyrgyz Republic ranks significantly low (164th out of 178 countries) in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption \nPerceptions Index 2011. ", "2 \n5.  The Investment Climate Improvement Program, approved by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in 2008, follows a programmatic approach and envisages three subprograms to \nassist the government in creating conditions for sustainable economic growth and employment-\ngenerating investments.5 Subprogram 1, implemented in 2007\u20132008, included a policy-based \ngrant,  a  project  grant  supporting  the  development  of  information  technology  systems  for \neffective implementation of reforms, and a TA grant to help prepare subprogram 2. Preparation \nand  implementation  of  subprogram 2  has  also  benefited  from  and  reinforced  other \ninterventions.6 The reforms supported under subprogram 2 build on the achievements made \nunder subprogram 1 despite difficult political and external conditions. They address binding \nconstraints to private sector development and diversification in the areas of business regulation \nand taxation, access to finance, worker skills development, and public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs). The relevance of these constraints has been confirmed through recent studies and \nsurveys,  which  explain  some  deviations  from  the  constraints  originally  identified  in  2008. \nSubprogram 2 is effectively gender mainstreamed to maximize benefits to women. The reform \nagenda that remains after subprogram 2 will be addressed under subprogram 3.  \n6.  Subprogram 2 complements the efforts of (i) ADB and other development partners to \nstrengthen  physical  infrastructure  and  improve  access to finance;  and  (ii)  the International \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  to  rebuild fiscal  buffers and  safeguard  monetary  stability,  which  are \nimportant for a healthy business and investment climate.7 \n7.  Improving the investment climate for the private sector is critical for the government\u2019s \neconomic growth policies.8 Subprogram 2 contributes toward this end. The Government of the \nKyrgyz  Republic  emphasizes  improving  the  business  climate.9 ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness plan for the Kyrgyz Republic identifies subprogram 2 as a means of broadening the \nKyrgyz economy and its private sector.10 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of subprogram 2 will be sustainable economic growth and employment \ncreation. The outcome will be an improved business environment and investment climate.  \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

Output 1: Cost of regulatory compliance reduced. Subprogram 2 has reduced the \nregulatory costs of operating a business and made regulatory action more transparent and \naccountable. This has also helped reduce the scope for fraud and corruption. \n ", "4 \n11.  Specifically, under subprogram 2, the government has simplified business registration by \nstreamlining  preregistration  requirements,  acceding to the  Hague  Apostille  Convention  that \nabolishes the requirement of legalization for foreign public documents, establishing one-stop \nregistration shops in all regions of the Kyrgyz Republic, and allowing electronic submission of \ndocuments. The latter is particularly important for entrepreneurs in remote areas, which are \noften rural women. The government has also reduced tax compliance costs and scope for \ninformal payments by simplifying tax forms and the profit tax system for small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), and introducing one-stop windows for taxpayers and electronic filing of tax \nreturns.  \n12.  Following a regulatory impact assessment,11 licenses have been reduced by more than \n20%.  The  number  of  licenses  can  be  further  reduced  and  their  validity  extended  under \nsubprogram  3.  Furthermore,  the  government  has  introduced  the  concept  of  risk-based \ninspections, which prioritizes firms with higher risk of noncompliance, instead of targeting all \nfirms. This approach helps use scarce regulatory capacity more efficiently, reduce compliance \ncost,  and  minimize  corruption.  The  number  of  inspection  agencies  will  be  reduced  under \nsubprogram  3.  Finally,  under  subprogram  2,  a  pilot  system  for  pre-customs  clearing  was \ninitiated  to  facilitate  compliance  with  cross-border  trade  rules.  The  system  automates  the \nexchange of information between government bodies involved in pre-customs clearance, and \nthe submission of documents to customs. \n13.  As a deviation from indicative actions included in the policy matrix for subprogram 2 in \n2008, subprogram 2 is not supporting deregistration of dormant companies, because it was not \nreconfirmed as a key binding constraint for the private sector. Further, ISO 9001 confirmation for \nthe one-stop business registration process has not been included given its time and resource \nrequirements. Instead, subprogram 2 has reduced tax compliance costs, as outlined above.  \n14.  Output  2:  Access  to  finance  improved.  Subprogram  2  has  addressed  structural \nimpediments to lending by promoting alternative financial products and strengthening nonbank \nfinancing sources, including microfinance organizations (MFOs). This will benefit SMEs and \nmicroenterprises\u2014particularly women entrepreneurs, who account for 75% of MFO borrowers. \n15.  Under subprogram 2, the government has improved creditor rights and  the dispute \nresolution framework by enabling accelerated court enforcement of arbitral awards to reduce \nforeclosure  costs.  Online  filing  of  pledges  and  payment  of  fees  will  be  enabled  under \nsubprogram 3. To help mitigate credit risks, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR), \nas regulator, has institutionalized incentives for financial institutions to share credit information \nby strengthening self-regulation of the credit bureau. The bureau now requires members to \ncheck credit histories of loan applicants and report credit events, while the NBKR is supervising \ncompliance. As an alternative to loans, the government has promoted financial leasing by \nremoving tax disadvantages compared to other borrowing instruments. Leasing may be very \nattractive for women who present a good credit risk but often cannot offer collateral. To increase \nthe availability of financial services, the NBKR is enabling MFOs to serve their clients better by \nextending  the  scope  of  their  services  beyond  loans  and  leasing.  The  NBKR  has  also \nstreamlined regulatory requirements for term deposits to improve the funding availability of \nMFOs, and clarified the process and requirements for the transformation of MFOs into deposit-\ntaking banks. This will allow larger MFOs to grow with their clients\u2019 needs. The NBKR has also \nenabled group lending to be classified as secured lending for banks\u2019 prudential requirements; \nthis will remove a specific transformation constraint and benefit borrowers without collateral.  \n                                                \n11  The regulatory impact assessment has been conducted since 2008 by a unit in the Ministry of Economy under the \noversight of an interministerial commission. Technical assistance was provided by ADB until 2010 and by the \nUnited States Agency for International Development until 2011. \n ", "5 \n16.  As a change from indicative actions included in the subprogram 2 policy matrix in 2008, \nsubprogram  2  does  not  support  public  awareness  campaigns  on  financial  leases,  since \nawareness is assessed as sufficiently strong. Further, subprogram 2 does not include a study \non options for developing credit information sharing, since credit information sharing is making \nsignificant progress. Instead, subprogram 2 has helped enhance the scope of services MFOs \ncan offer. \n17.  Output 3: Workers\u2019 skills enhanced. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s technical and vocational \neducation and training system has not been responsive to changing market needs, contributing \nto unemployment and widening skill gaps in the labor market. Subprogram 2 has strengthened \nthe  institutional  framework  for  workforce  skills  development,  which  has  been  made  more \ndemand-driven by establishing the National Professional Skills Development Council (NPSDC) \nin March 2012. NPSDC comprises representatives of public and private stakeholders, including \nwomen entrepreneurs. Further, technical qualification frameworks, competency standards, and \ntraining packages for 18 occupations (five of which women dominated)12 have been adopted \nand pilot training undertaken by the Agency for Vocational Education. Output 3 was not included \nin the indicative actions under subprogram 2 in 2008, since the lack of skilled workers has \nrecently developed into a binding constraint for private businesses. \n18.  Output 4: Public\u2013private partnerships facilitated. To provide PPP with a strong legal \nbasis in the Kyrgyz Republic, a PPP law in line with international good practices was enacted \nunder subprogram 2. This will prepare the ground for bringing sector laws in line with the PPP \nlaw, and for developing standard tender documents and procedures under subprogram 3. Under \nsubprogram 2, the government has also adopted a policy framework for PPP projects that \nestablishes criteria for financial support and risk sharing. Further, the capacity of a PPP risk \nmanagement  unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  a  unit  for  PPP  promotion  and \ncoordination in the Ministry of Economy (MOE)13 were further strengthened. Under subprogram \n3, complementary capacity for PPP project development needs to be built in sector ministries \nand at local government levels, including Bishkek city, to facilitate project development and \n \nmanagement.14 This has been confirmed while developing and institutionalizing a screening \nmechanism for potential PPP projects in public sector investment pipelines under subprogram 2. \nSeven projects have been identified for pre-feasibility studies with the help of this mechanism.15 \nSubprogram 3 will support a study on PPP entry points in the health sector, which is particularly  A\np\nimportant for maternal health services.  pe\nn\nd\n19.

The last five occupations are dominated by women. \n13  Until December 2011, the name of the ministry was Ministry of Economic Regulation.  \n14  ADB is coordinating capacity building with the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which provides TA for \nPPP. \n15  These projects are airports in Osh and Issyk-Kul; a toll road from Bazar Korgon to Sargata; a road bypass from \nBishkek to Kara Balta; and solid waste management, parking, and street lighting projects in Bishkek city. \n ", "6 \nexcluded  to  ensure  that  only  a  minimum  number  of  actions  critical  for  removing  binding \nconstraints are selected.16 \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n20.  The government has requested a policy-based grant not exceeding $20 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 2.17 Grant proceeds will be made \navailable for withdrawal in a single tranche upon grant effectiveness. All policy actions included \nin the policy matrix of subprogram 2 have been complied with (Appendix 4). The local currency \nfunds generated by the grant will finance the government\u2019s development expenditure program.  \n21.  The grant size is justified in light of the overall development finance needs of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. The government has embarked on a process of fiscal consolidation under an IMF-\nsupported program with the aim to reduce public debt from 62.6% of GDP in 2010 to 55.1% in \n2014. The state budget for 2012 foresees expenditure of Som115.8 billion (or $2.5 billion). This \nis  equivalent  to  about  38.4%  of  forecast  GDP,  down  from  39.7%  in  2011.  However,  the \ngovernment plans to keep capital expenditure at the same level as in 2011 at about 7.0% of \nGDP, given its importance for growth.18 The planned budget deficit for 2012 is equivalent to \n6.7% of GDP, down from 7.6% in 2011. The government does not have access to international \ncapital markets. Domestic deficit financing is still restricted by the legacy of the recent global \ncrisis, which hit banks and securities markets in the Kyrgyz Republic particularly hard. Deficit \nfinancing, thus, mainly depends on access to concessional funds from abroad. Without these \nfunds, capital expenditure would have to be cut substantially, which would decelerate GDP \ngrowth and potentially undermine social and political stability. The proposed grant of $20 million \nis equivalent to 0.3% of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s GDP, 4.3% of capital expenditure, and 4.5% of \nthe budget deficit in 2012. The grant will, as such, make a small but important contribution to \nmeeting the country\u2019s financing needs. The budget support committed by the World Bank for \n2012 is of similar magnitude. The disbursements planned by the IMF in 2012 are slightly higher \nat 0.4% of GDP.  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Subprogram 2 maintains the implementation arrangements of subprogram 1 for the \npolicy-based grant. MOE as executing agency is responsible for coordinating the program \nactivities. Implementing agencies are MOE; MOF; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Youth, \nLabor and Employment; the NBKR; and the State Tax Service. The high-level program steering \ncommittee and working group of subprogram 1 has been retained. The implementation period \nfor subprogram 2 is January 2009 to December 2012. \n23.  The grant proceeds will be disbursed to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as the \nrecipient in accordance with ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans.19 The  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  cost \n                                                \n16  Notwithstanding, the government aims to draft an interim master plan for the transport sector by end-2012. \n17  A country\u2019s eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that the Kyrgyz Republic had a \nmoderate risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n18  An ex ante disaggregation of capital expenditure into individual sectors or projects is not possible because of the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s budget mechanism, which foresees the approval of a total amount of capital expenditure for the \ncoming fiscal year, which is detailed in the course of the year in line with incoming revenues. Capital spending is, \nas such, the main buffer on the expenditure side of the budget. Ex post, a detailed list of government-financed \ninvestment projects in 2012 will be available. In 2011, education and road transport projects each accounted for \n31% of development spending from the central government budget, followed by 21% for urban services. \n19 ADB. 1998.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n24.  TA will be provided to assist the government in preparing subprogram 3. Indicative \noutputs include support for policy reforms and capacity building for (i) business regulation, \n(ii) access to finance, and (iii) PPP. MOE will be the executing agency. MOE and the NBKR will \nbe the main implementing agencies. The TA will be implemented from November 2012 to May \n2014. The TA will engage 13.0 person-months of international and 52.0 person-months of \nnational consulting services. Consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA \nis estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, of which (i) $550,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV); and (ii) $150,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Fund,20 and \nadministered by ADB. The government will provide support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, administrative support, and other in-kind contributions.21 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The primary beneficiaries of subprogram 2 are the investors and entrepreneurs who \nbenefit from an improved legal and regulatory environment. Subprogram 2 has also indirectly \nbenefited the working age population, as investment opportunities translate into job creation \nand/or  better  wages.  By  reducing  regulatory  costs,  subprogram  2  has  attracted  more \nbusinesses into the formal sector, thus increasing the number of formal jobs and, potentially, tax \nrevenues. The students of vocational schools and clients of financial service providers have also \nbenefited  from  subprogram  2.  Because  of  economies  of  agglomeration,  investment  and   \nemployment opportunities are expected to be concentrated in urban areas. Nonetheless, the \nrural population has still benefited from an improved business climate and better access to \nfinancial services. \nA\np\n26.  Specifically, about 5,100 new legal entities are registered in the Kyrgyz Republic every  p\ne\nyear, of which more than 40% are in Bishkek. These firms benefit from subprogram 2 reforms,  n\nd\nwhich reduced the time to register a business from 21 days in 2007 to 10 days in 2011.22 As a  ix 1\nresult, the Kyrgyz Republic now ranks 17th across 183 economies on the ease of starting a       7\nbusiness. The automated business registration, established under subprogram 2 in February   \n2012, further reduces business registration to 3 days. In addition, foreign direct investors benefit \nfrom the accession of the Kyrgyz Republic to the Hague Apostille Convention, which has \nremoved the requirement to provide legalized copies of constitutive documents of their home \ncountry.23 \n27.  In 2008, there were 470 different business licenses and permits, which on average had \nto be renewed every 23 months for SMEs or 13 months for individual entrepreneurs.24 The \nreduction of licenses under subprogram 2 has significantly reduced the regulatory burden for \nmost  enterprises  and  the  scope  for  corruption.  Similarly,  in  2008,  73%  of  individual \n                                                \n20 Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg. \n21 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 World Bank. 2011. Doing Business 2012. Washington, DC. \n23 At the end of 2010, more than 2,600 enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic were officially foreign-owned. \n24 International Finance Corporation. 2010. Investment Climate in the Kyrgyz Republic as Seen by Small and Medium \nEnterprises. Washington, DC. \n ", "8 \nentrepreneurs,  69%  of  SMEs,  and  29%  of  farmers  were  investigated  by  at  least  one \ninspectorate, and many by several. Less than 17% of inspections resulted in sanctions. The \nintroduction of risk-based inspections under subprogram 2 helps to better use scarce regulatory \nresources, reduce the burden faced by compliant businesses, and minimize corruption. \n28.  On average, firms in the Kyrgyz Republic make 52 tax payments per year and spend \n210 hours filing, preparing, and paying taxes. By introducing electronic filing of taxes, simplifying \ntax forms, and streamlining SME taxation, subprogram 2 has substantially reduced compliance \ncosts and scope for disputes through minimizing interaction with tax officials\u2014reducing potential \nmisconduct, fraud, and corruption. More than 2,500 companies have already benefited from \nelectronic filing of tax reports; the number is expected to increase substantially in the medium \nterm. The simplified tax forms benefit all enterprises in the country, particularly SMEs. \n29.  Documentation for customs clearance requires an average of 23 days and $210 for \nexports, and 25 days and $280 for imports.25 The automated system of pre-customs clearance \ndeveloped under subprogram 2 has substantially reduced these time and cost requirements. \nAmong  the  first  beneficiaries  are  12  firms  included  in  a  pilot  test  in  June  2012.  Further \ninvestment will be needed to make the automated system available to all businesses in all \nregions.26 \n30.  As a result of prior reforms in the area of secured lending and out-of-court arbitration of \ncommercial disputes, collateral registration increased multifold from about 2,100 pledges in \n2008  to  more  than  26,000  in  2010;  and  arbitration  is  widely  used  for  asset  foreclosure. \nHowever,  long  enforcement  periods  of  arbitral  awards  remain  a  serious  constraint.  The \naccelerated court enforcement of arbitral awards introduced under subprogram 2 should reduce \nthe enforcement period from 8 months in 2010 to about 4 months. Given that 75% of arbitration \ncases involve loan transactions, the change should substantially reduce costs associated with \nlending and foreclosure. Direct beneficiaries will be financial institutions that foreclose assets. \nFurther, lower lending cost should, in turn, reduce the risk premium for loans in the form of high \ninterest rates and/or excessive collateral requirements, which equaled about 157% of the loan \namount for small firms and 98% for large firms in 2009.27 Potential beneficiaries are all non-\nprime borrowers. The reforms in support of credit information sharing will have the same effect. \n31.  Financial leasing provides an alternative instrument of risk mitigation. The removal of tax \ndisadvantages  for  financial  leases  under  subprogram  2  will  increase  the  number  of  lease \ntransactions (average of 63 in 2006\u20132010) by at least 50% in 2012. Leasing will particularly \nbenefit creditworthy women entrepreneurs, who frequently cannot offer collateral. For the same \nreason, women will also benefit from support for group lending under subprogram 2. Since \nwomen account for a majority of MFO clients, they will also benefit from the improvement of the \nfunding base of MFOs and the likely reduction in interest rates. At least three MFOs are \nexpected to apply for a license for taking term-deposits in 2012.  \n32.  Worker skills training under subprogram 2 takes place in 25 primary vocational schools \nand covers 18 priority occupations, of which five are dominated by women. Direct beneficiaries \nare the teachers trained in the use of instructional materials and the training participants. In \nFebruary\u2013March 2012, 214 students were trained in a pilot occupation, 204 of which were \nwomen. Most students of vocational schools are currently unemployed and the training should \nincrease  their  chances  of  finding  employment.  Indirect  beneficiaries  will  be  businesses \n                                                \n25 The Kyrgyz Republic ranks 171st across 183 economies on the ease of trading across borders (footnote 22). \n26 ADB  is  considering  further  assistance  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  initiative  in \npromoting the single-window approach in external trade. \n27 World Bank. 2011.

More than 2,400 SMEs, \n180,000 individual entrepreneurs, and 330,000 farms are active in these areas.  \n33.  The PPP-related reforms under subprogram 2 are important milestones for creating an \nenabling environment for PPP. Seven potential PPP projects have been identified, but pre-\nfeasibility studies have yet to be undertaken and projects tendered and implemented. This is \nwhy benefits from PPP projects will materialize under subprogram 3 at the earliest. \nB.  Governance \n34.  Budget planning and execution, and fiduciary controls have been assessed through a \npublic expenditure and financial accountability assessment undertaken in 2009,28 and a public \nfinancial management assessment undertaken in 2011\u20132012 to feed into ADB\u2019s new country \npartnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n35.  2010\u20132011 was a period of political volatility and change in the Kyrgyz Republic, which \ncreated additional challenges for public financial management, including high staff turnover and \nfrequent policy changes, but also great opportunities. Governance had substantially deteriorated \nin the years before the ouster of President Bakiev in April 2010. Since a provisional government \nwas  established,  important  positive  changes  included  introducing  management  information \nsystems,  automating  tax  and  custom  operations,  modernizing  treasury  operations,  and \ndecentralizing some financial management functions to local governments. Subprogram 2 has \nmade an important contribution by supporting deregulation and automation. However, because \nof social unrest and economic volatility, the predictability of revenues and, in turn, budget \nplanning and execution remained key public financial management issues. The new President \nwas elected in October 2011 and inaugurated in December. Subsequently, a new coalition \ngovernment was elected by Parliament. A higher degree of political stability than in 2010\u20132011 \ncan be expected in the foreseeable future.   \n36.  A key procurement constraint is the often nontransparent and discretionary application of   \nthe  existing  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  The  government  has  been  establishing  a \nprocurement database in MOF to address this issue and most ministries already contribute. \nFurther, in February 2012, the government decided to prioritize e-procurement to limit the scope \nfor corruption and requested support from development partners in this area.29 Audit functions  Ap\np\nare  in  place  throughout  government,  but  further  streamlining  of  audit  agency  roles  and  e\nn\nd\nresponsibilities  would  be  beneficial.

Poverty and Social \n37.  Subprogram 2 is expected to support the government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts in the \nmedium-to-long  term  through  higher  and  sustainable  economic  growth  and  employment \ncreation. This will mainly result from better access to financial services and lower regulatory \ncompliance  costs  for  enterprises  and  individual  entrepreneurs,  including  cost  related  to \ncorruption.  More  direct,  short-term  effects  include  the  increased  provision  of  microfinance \n(which is expected to help the poor) and the development of leasing (which will improve the \n                                                \n28 Department for International Development, Ministry of Finance, Swiss Cooperation Office, and World Bank. 2009. \nKyrgyz Republic: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment.

ADB is considering capacity \ndevelopment assistance for e-procurement in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n ", "10 \naccess to finance for creditworthy borrowers without collateral). The enhancement of workers\u2019 \nskills  and  consequent  increase  in  employment  opportunities  and  incomes  will  also  directly \ncontribute to poverty reduction. \n38.  A recent survey indicates that firms in the Kyrgyz Republic are more likely to have full-\ntime female workers and female participation in ownership than firms in most other countries in \nEastern Europe and Central Asia (footnote 27). However, stereotypes and patriarchal views of \nwomen\u2019s role in society continue to limit women\u2019s ability to develop businesses. Men are almost \nthree times more likely to engage in full-time entrepreneurial activities than women or to identify \nthemselves  as  self-employed.  Main  constraints  are  limited  access  to  affordable  financial \nservices, limited skills, and registration systems that make it difficult for women to establish \nformal businesses. Moreover, data about women business ownership are limited, which makes \nit  difficult to  design  targeted  support  policies. Under  subprogram  2, MFOs  will  be  able  to \nbroaden their services and reduce funding cost, which will disproportionally benefit women, who \naccount for 75% of MFO clients. Support for leasing and group lending under subprogram 2 will \nalso benefit creditworthy women, who often cannot offer collateral. The automated business \nregistration creates sex-disaggregated data and will allow monitoring and analysis of female \nbusiness ownership. Finally, the NPSDC includes representatives from two organizations that \nrepresent the interests of women entrepreneurs, so that the voice of women can be heard when \ndeciding on skills development. Subprogram 2 is, therefore, categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming. \nD.  Safeguards \n39.  Subprogram 2 has no impact on indigenous peoples, involuntary resettlement, and the \nenvironment and has, therefore, been categorized as C.  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Subprogram 2 is classified as medium risk. Major risks and mitigating measures are \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30  \nV.  ASSURANCES \n41.  The government and MOE have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant documents. \nVI.
