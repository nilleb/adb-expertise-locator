THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Horticulture Value Chain Development Project.1 \n \n2.   The proposed project will support the Government of Uzbekistan strategy in horticulture \nvalue chain development by increasing outreach of participating financial institutions (PFIs) to \nhorticulture  farmers  and  entrepreneurs  in  all  12  regions  nationwide  and  the  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan.  It  will  improve  access  to  market-based  bank  finance  for  farmers,  agro-\nprocessing enterprises, owners and operators of cold storage facilities, and trading and logistics \nservice suppliers in the horticulture value chain. The project will help increase farm productivity, \nimprove processing and storage capacity, and reduce post-harvest losses through upgrading \nand establishing intensive orchards, modern and efficient greenhouses, and processing, storage, \nand refrigeration facilities. This will, in turn, promote long-term economic and environmental \nsustainability, and enhance profitability for farmers and agribusiness enterprises.2 \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector performance. Uzbekistan\u2019s economy has grown consistently during 2010\u20132015. \nDuring 2010\u20132013, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at annual rates of more than 8.0%, \nreaching  $66.7  billion  in  2015.3 The  economy proved  resilient  to  the downward  pressures \nexerted  from  2008  onward  on  other  economies  by  the  global  financial  crisis.  Despite  an \neconomic downturn in the Russian Federation, Uzbekistan\u2019s major trading partner and source of \nremittances, the Uzbek economy is expected to maintain GDP growth rates of 6.9% in 2016 and \n7.3% in 2017. Overall poverty, according to national poverty line estimates, declined from 27.5% \nof the population in 2001 to 13.7% in 2014 as a result of rapid economic growth.4 Along with \noverall economic growth, agricultural GDP in Uzbekistan grew at annual rates ranging from \n6.3% (2014) to 7.1% (2012). The agriculture sector is projected to grow by 6.0% in 2016 and \n6.5% in 2017. However, the expansion of and higher rate of growth in other sectors resulted in a \ndecline in the agriculture sector\u2019s GDP contribution. In 2000, agriculture accounted for 34.4% of \nGDP. This had fallen to 18.3% by 2015. Agricultural GDP has traditionally derived from the \nproduction  of  cotton  and  wheat,  which  the  government  regarded  as  strategic  crops  and \nsupported through preferential access to land, inputs, and finance. However, there has been a \nshift in these crops\u2019 contribution to GDP since 2000. The share of cotton production in GDP \ndeclined from 3.6% in 2000 to 2.3% in 2013.5 Over the same period, the contribution of grains to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Horticulture \nValue Chain Development Project (formerly Innovations for Agriculture Modernization Project) (TA 8567-UZB), and \na small-scale project preparatory TA was provided to assist with the national feasibility study and project start-up. \n3  World  Bank  estimate  in  United  States  dollars.  http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/uzbekistan  (accessed  30 \nAugust 2016). \n4  On the basis of $1.90 purchasing power parity criterion, an estimated 68.1% of the population was below the \npoverty line in 2012. ADB. 2016. Basic 2016 Statistics. Manila. \n5  Cotton production area has been declining at an annual rate of 2.3%, from 2.1 million hectares (ha) in 1991 to 1.3 \nmillion ha in 2014, accounting for 27.4% of total cropland in 2014 (4.7 million ha) compared with 43.5% in 1991. \nCotton output has been decreasing by 6.3% per annum, from 1.7 million tons of lint cotton in 1991 to 0.8 million \ntons of lint cotton (equivalent to about 3.0 million tons of seed cotton) in 2014. Cotton export has been declining at \nan annual rate of 10.0% since 1991, and average cotton yield from 2.7 tons to 2.1 tons per ha in seed cotton \nmeasures. \n ", "2 \n \nGDP fell from 3.4% to 2.4%6 while the combined share of fruits and vegetables increased from \n5.2% to 10.6%. \n \n4.  Despite its declining share of GDP, agriculture remains an important sector. In 2015, it \naccounted for 32% of total employment. It is also a key income source in rural areas, where \n49% of the population resides and which account for 75% of people living below the poverty line. \nAbout 4.7 million rural households operating dehkan (small-scale) farms derive their income \nfrom agriculture. Dehkan farms, which operate independently of government support, account \nfor the production of 64% of vegetables, 75% of potatoes, 52% of fruit, and 45% of grapes on \nfarms of 0.35\u20130.50 hectares (ha). \n \n5.  The shift in production from cotton and wheat to horticulture is also reflected in exports. \nAgricultural exports grew at an annual average rate (in current dollar terms) of 12.5% during \n2000\u20132013, while cotton exports grew by an annual rate of only 2.0%. During 2010\u20132013, \ncotton exports declined from $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion, while the share of cotton exports in total \nexports fell from 27.5% in 2000 to 7.4% in 2014. By comparison, the share of food products in \nexports rose from 5% in 2000 to 12% in 2014.7 Fruit and vegetable exports grew from $68.7 \nmillion in 2000 to $1.4 billion in 2013, equating to an average annual growth rate of 26%, while \nthe share of fruits and vegetables in total exports increased from 2% to 9%. In 2014, the value \nof fruit and vegetable exports exceeded that of cotton exports by 30% (almost $500 million). \n \n6.  Binding  constraints.  Although  it  is  expected  to  continue  to  grow,  agriculture  is \ncharacterized  by  low  productivity  and  remains  labor  intensive.  The  horticulture  sector  is \nconstrained by limited access to quality land, specialized horticulture machinery, appropriate \ninputs, and in particular finance. Limited access to either equity or long-term debt financing for \nproducers and enterprises throughout the value chain constrains the sector\u2019s development. The \nhorticulture sector does not receive preferential financing under government programs, as in the \ncase of cotton and wheat production. Financial institutions have a largely negative perception of \nagriculture  profitability  and  creditworthiness,  exacerbated  by  an  undeveloped  regulatory \nframework for the use of movable assets as loan collateral, and a lack of acceptable collateral \namong many small-scale producers or collateral with low realizable values among agribusiness \nenterprises.  Further,  access  to  information  on  potential  borrowers  is  limited  as  the  credit \ninformation system is not yet effective. Financial institutions have yet to develop credit policies \nand loan products appropriate to the needs of horticulture producers and enterprises, including \ncash flow-based loan appraisal suitable for horticulture investment and seasonality of production. \n \n7.  The high cost of funds, perceived risks, and administrative costs associated with lending \nto individuals and small business require banks to charge interest rates from 11% to 25% for \nlocal currency loans and from 6% to 15% for foreign currency loans. Individuals and small \nbusinesses are required to borrow at the higher end of these ranges. Deposit mobilization is \nundermined by public mistrust in banks, compounded by administrative hurdles in withdrawing \ncash from bank accounts, with a fee of up to 20% of the transaction amount. Bank lending for \ninvestment  is  constrained  by  the  predominantly  short-term  maturity  of  funding  sources. \nParticularly, access to finance for private individuals and enterprises is constrained by weak \nrural branch networks and limited mobile banking services. Eighty percent of small businesses \nare funded by family, friends, and informal sources.8 In addition, farmers and agribusiness \nenterprises have poorly developed business and managerial skills and generally low financial \n                                                \n6  Uzbekistan State Committee on Statistics. 2014. Statistical Report 2014. Tashkent. \n7  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investment and Trade.  http://www.mfer.uz (accessed 30 August 2016). \n8  World Bank. 2014. Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, 2012\u20132014. Washington, DC. ", "3 \nliteracy. Surveys indicate that small businesses generally lack access to information on market \nopportunities, suppliers, competitors, technology, and banking products.9 The low income level \nof rural households, many of which are led by women, also limits their access to financial \nservices and ability to invest. Access to finance  remains a constraint for private business \ngrowth.10 \n \n8.  Opportunities. The potential of a growing and more sophisticated consumer demand for \nboth fresh and processed products in domestic and export markets is not being realized due to \nsuch  constraints.  Significantly  larger  volumes  of  produce  with  improved  quality  could  be \nmarketed with better post-harvest logistics, notably cold storage and transport.11 Of the 17.4 \nmillion tons of horticultural output in 2015, only 15% was processed. Of the 2.5 million tons of \nfruits produced, 69% are consumed fresh, 20% processed, and 11% exported, while for the 9.3 \nmillion tons of vegetables, 81% are consumed fresh, 11% processed, 4% used for seed, and \n3% exported. This indicates a significant opportunity for improved value addition from increased \nprocessing  and  exports  of  both  fresh  and  processed  products.  Revealed  comparative \nadvantage analysis suggests that Uzbekistan is more specialized in producing horticultural \nproducts than many of the world\u2019s producers, indicating its potential to expand its exports. The \ntraditional  market  for  Uzbek  horticulture  produce  has  been  the  Russian  Federation,  which \naccounts for 80% of Uzbekistan\u2019s exports, but these imports only account for 3%\u20134% of all fruit \nand vegetable imports to the Russian Federation. Uzbek exports could expand significantly by \ncapturing a larger share of the Russian Federation market. Beyond this market, there is also \nscope for Uzbek horticulture exports  to European markets. However, accessing European, \nespecially European Union, markets will require improvement in horticulture quality and safety \nstandards and certification systems. In this context, there is considerable scope to improve \nstorage, processing, and marketing technologies. \n \n9.  Continued  diversification  from  cotton  and  wheat  production  toward  horticulture  also \noffers  significant  environmental  benefits  as  it  could  decrease  demand  for  irrigation  water. \nClimate change projections for Uzbekistan from 2005 to 2050 indicate that (i) water demand will \nincrease from 59 billion cubic meters (m3) to 62 billion\u201363 billion m3, (ii) supply will decrease \nfrom 57 billion m3 to 52 billion\u201354 billion m3, and (iii) the water deficit will increase by more than \n500% from about 2 billion m3 to 11 billion\u201313 billion m3.12 Horticulture crops typically use less \nwater than cotton and are more efficient in water use than grain crops. In Uzbekistan, 4,426 m3 \nof water is required to grow a ton of cotton and 2,068 m3 of water for a ton of wheat.13 By \ncomparison, grape and apple production per ton requires about 2,400 m3 and 820 m3of water, \nrespectively.  \n \n10.  Government\u2019s sector strategy. The government aims to take more steps to increase \nagriculture  production.14 Measures  include  (i)  further  structural  reforms  in  agriculture  and \ndiversification  of  agricultural  production;  (ii)  mechanization  of  agriculture,  improvement  of \ninfrastructure, and development of agribusiness; (iii) more productive use of land and water; (iv) \n                                                \n9  Center for Economic Research. 2014.

Under this decree, a program of \nmeasures on structural reforms, modernization, and diversification of production for 2015\u20132019 was adopted. ", "4 \n \ngreater financial stability of farm entities; and (v) more market-oriented agricultural policies. \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources has prepared a sector development plan to 2020 \nthat includes further reductions in cotton and wheat production and an increase in horticulture \nproduction. The strategy for further land reallocation will result in increased area for potatoes by \n36,000 ha, vegetables by 91,000 ha, fruit orchards by 18,000 ha, and vineyards by 11,200 ha.15 \nThe strategy will also target improved logistics, processing, and exports for several activities, \nincluding horticulture.16 A policy initiative has established a state procurement system for fruits \nand vegetables.17 It intends to procure fruits and vegetables for delivery to processors and for \nstorage to ensure adequate off-season supply for consumers, and entrusts responsibility for \nfresh fruit and vegetable export to two state entities. \n \n11.  In  the  banking  and  finance  sector,  the  government  has  implemented  programs  to \nsupport small business and banking sector growth, and has increased access to finance. To \nimprove the capacity of the banks to assess borrower creditworthiness, the Law on Credit \nInformation,  promulgated  in  2011,  has  established  a  public  credit  bureau.  To  facilitate \nregistration of movable assets as loan collateral, the 2013 Law on Collateral Registry supports \nestablishing an electronically secured transactions registry. Laws enacted in the late 1990s \nneed to be improved to facilitate the use of movable property as collateral. Assisted by the \nInternational Finance Corporation, the government has prepared draft legal amendments for \nenactment  in  2017.  The  government\u2019s  development  strategy  is  consistent  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Uzbekistan. And it is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018.18 \n \n12.  Development partners have supported agriculture and horticulture through a variety of \nprojects and technical assistance (TA) support. The World Bank has implemented two rural \nenterprise  restructuring  projects  that  included  the  provision  of  credit  to  farmers  and  food-\nprocessing  enterprises.  The  World  Bank  is  implementing  a  $150  million  Horticulture \nDevelopment Project, which includes (i) providing credit lines to PFIs, (ii) improving financial \nliteracy and business-planning skills for horticulture farmers and agribusiness enterprises, (iii) \nestablishing  the  national  network  of  private  growers  through  training  and  TA,  and  (iv) \nstrengthening state research institutes and plant protection services. The International Fund for \nAgricultural Development is implementing a $30 million Horticulture Development Project. Other \ndevelopment partners have also provided broad support to enhance the business environment, \nand capacity building for financial institutions and small business.19 \n \n13.  Potential for female entrepreneurship. In 2015, agriculture accounted for 32% of the \ntotal workforce (or about 10 million people), of which men accounted for 54% and women 46%. \nDespite their prominent role in agricultural production, women are mainly engaged in simple and \nnontechnical fieldwork or cultivation of family-owned gardens. While rural women and female \ndehkan farmers, in particular, are an important part of the horticulture value chain, they lack \nconfidence to start businesses and face difficulties finding formal jobs because of inadequate \ntechnical skills and access to information, and limited entrepreneurship and leadership skills. \n                                                \n15 Under the farm size optimization program approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 29 December 2015. \n16 Government of Uzbekistan. 2016.

The project will help the government draw valuable \nlessons in formulating conducive and market-based sector policies, address water scarcity and \nsoil salinity issues through crop diversification, and enhance private sector participation in the \nagriculture value chains to increase efficiency gains while reducing state fiscal burden. This will \nenable ADB and other development partners to focus on comprehensive export-expansion \ninitiatives through best-practice production, and proper post-harvest processing and handling \nfollowing international quality and safety standards. Moreover, through enhanced access to \nlong-term finance, PFIs will be able to sustainably increase their outreach into horticultural \nbusiness as a high-potential niche. Expanded export of horticultural produce will help increase \noverall price and income transmission to small-scale producers, and small- and medium-sized \nagribusinesses. Capacity development activities will enhance subborrowers\u2019 technical capacity \nfor their proposed investments. The project design incorporates lessons learned from previous \nand ongoing development partner-funded projects that support the government\u2019s sector policies \nand strategies. Lessons call for (i) diversifying from cotton\u2013wheat crop rotations; (ii) investing in \nmodern production systems; (iii) addressing the whole value chain to ensure sufficient logistical \ncapacity;  (iv)  implementing  a  demand-driven  approach  to  commercial  financing;  and  (v) \nproviding technical support to PFIs, enabling them to better assess horticulture-related loan \napplications.20 Project readiness is enhanced by financing of taxes and duties on eligible project \nmanagement expenditures.21 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact will be improved contribution of the horticulture sector to inclusive economic \ngrowth and rural employment (footnote 14). The outcome will be increased production and \nmarketing of horticultural products. \n \nC.  Output \n16.  The output will be increased financing for horticulture sector. PFIs will receive credit lines \nfrom the ADB loan to extend subloans to interested and qualified subborrowers for horticulture \noperations, including planting materials, processing and storage equipment, and mechanical \nequipment.22 Through the management and implementation budget, the project will provide \ncapacity  building,  training,  and  technical  support  to  (i)  PFIs  in  subloan  appraisals  and \nenvironmental safeguards compliances; and (ii) subborrowers in business planning, horticulture \nagronomic techniques, post-harvesting operations, and export market penetration. The project \nmanagement office based in the Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA) will oversee implementation \nactivities, including monitoring of sublending; compliances for safeguards, gender, and financial \ncovenants; and financial auditing. \n \nD.

The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements. \nSubborrowers will contribute $40 million as their equity contribution for subprojects financed by \nthe  loan,  and  the  government  will  contribute  $21  million,  including  $19  million  through \nexemptions of taxes and duties for imported goods and $2 million for interest charges during \nimplementation.23 The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2  and  further  detailed  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).24 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($  Share of Total  \nmillion)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nAsian Development Fund loan  154.0  71.6 \nSubborrowers\u2019 Equity Contributions  40.0  18.6 \nGovernment  21.0  9.8 \nTotal  215.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.  The government will relend the loan proceeds in United States (US) dollars to PFIs \nthrough subsidiary loan agreements that satisfy ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria set out in the PAM and \nthe loan and project agreements.25 The government is expected to relend the loan proceeds to \nPFIs for a tenor of 20 years and a grace period of 3 years. The government\u2019s relending rate will \n                                                \n23 PFIs will determine subborrower equity contributions based on the nature of the credit risk, which, depending on \neach PFI\u2019s credit policy, would range from 20% to 30% of the subproject cost. \n24 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Based on each PFI absorptive capacity, tentative allocation of loan proceeds is as follows: Asaka Bank ($10 \nmillion), Davr Bank ($6 million), Hamkorbank ($25 million), Ipak Yuli Bank ($10 million), Ipoteka Bank ($11 million), \nNational Bank of Uzbekistan ($50 million), Turon Bank ($5 million), and Uzpromstroybank ($15 million).

PFIs\u2019 subloans may be issued in US dollars and/or local currency, and priced by PFIs at \nmarket rates that cover risks related to foreign exchange, credit, maturity, and interest rates. \nSubloan repayment may be in US dollars and/or local currency subject to the subborrowers\u2019 \ndemand and subprojects\u2019 revenue streams, as well as specific agreements between PFIs and \nsubborrowers.  Subloans  extended  by  PFIs  will  have  a  tenor  of  up  to  10  years.  PFIs  will \ndetermine the creditworthiness of subborrowers and assume the full credit risk. The maximum \nsubloan size will be $5 million based on previous and prospective demand of PFIs\u2019 clientele. \n \n21.  Participating  financial  institutions.  Eight  PFIs  were  selected  among  commercial \nbanks that expressed interest to participate in the project, and underwent subsequent detailed \ndue diligence by ADB. They are Asaka Bank, Davr Bank, Hamkorbank, Ipak Yuli Bank, Ipoteka \nBank, National Bank of Uzbekistan, Turon Bank, and Uzpromstroybank. PFIs for the most part \nare in compliance with the Central Bank of Uzbekistan prudential regulations and meet ADB\u2019s \neligibility requirements for financial intermediaries and ADB-determined financial covenants.27 \nTo  address  areas  of  minor  noncompliance,  PFIs  will  be  required  to  satisfy  disbursement \nconditions and to implement action plans for financial covenants, as indicated in the PAM. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2017\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 (loan closing date: 30 June 2022) \nManagement \n(i) Executing agency  RRA \n(ii) Key implementing  PFIs: Asaka Bank, Davr Bank, Hamkorbank, Ipak Yuli Bank, Ipoteka \nagencies  Bank, National Bank of Uzbekistan, Turon Bank, and Uzpromstroybank \n(iii) Implementation units  Project management office under RRA and one project implementation \nunit in each PFI \nProcurementa  Shopping (goods)  5 contracts  $0.09 million \nConsulting servicesa  CQS (advisory \n3 contracts  $0.60 million \nservices) \nLCS (financial auditing)  1 contract  $0.15 million \nAdvance contracting  Not applicable \nDisbursement  Loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and arrangements \nagreed between the Government of Uzbekistan and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultant\u2019s qualifications selection, LCS = least-cost selection, PFI = \nparticipating financial institution, RRA = Rural Restructuring Agency. \na  Goods  and  consulting  services  related  to  project  management  will  be  procured  by  RRA  following  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \nSource: ADB. \n                                                \n26 The government will charge the interest on the ADB loan plus 0.2% per annum to the PFIs. The PFIs\u2019 interest rates \ncarry the cost for (i) loan origination, (ii) provision of foreign exchange to service the ADB loan, and (iii) credit risk \nand related capital charges. \n27 Based on seven (7) eligibility criteria set out in para. 8 of ADB. 2008. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations \nManual. OM D6/BP. Manila. ", "8 \n \n23.  The executing agency is RRA, which was established under the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Water Resources in the form of an incorporated agency as part of the government to \nfacilitate the implementation of certain agriculture projects. RRA is familiar with similar projects \nfinanced by the World Bank for small- and medium-sized enterprises and the horticulture sector \ndevelopment. To ensure long-term programmatic development in the horticulture sector, it is \nimportant  to  engage  RRA  as  a  sector  institution  to  (i)  coordinate  and  facilitate  sector \ndevelopment, (ii) monitor sublending to PFIs, and (iii) provide capacity building and technical \nsupport to other sector institutions, PFIs and subborrowers, in addition to monitoring compliance \nfor safeguards, gender, and financial covenants. Based on lessons from previous ADB-financed \nfinancial intermediation projects and those with RRA as the executing agency, the project will \nchannel more than 95% of the loan proceeds directly to PFIs through their imprest accounts to \nexpedite disbursement. Tasks assigned to RRA\u2019s scope of contract management will cover the \npurchase of minor items such as vehicles, office equipment and supplies, and supervision of \ncertain technical expert service contracts, estimated at  a total of $3 million. The borrower \naccepts RRA's liabilities under the project through covenanting in the loan agreement that it will \nensure that RRA has sufficient funds to satisfy its liabilities arising from any goods and/or \nconsulting services contracts. \n \n24.  Based on PFIs\u2019 portfolio analysis and loan utilization on various development partner-\nfinanced projects of a similar nature, it is envisaged that many potential subborrowers of PFI \nsubloans will procure goods, works, and consulting services from both ADB and non-ADB \nmember countries, including the Russian Federation and Israel. A request to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors is being made, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (the Charter), to approve procurement of goods, works, and consulting \nservices from non-ADB member countries by subborrowers using loan proceeds under the \nproject in appropriate circumstances.28 This request reflects the market-based nature of the \nproject, subborrowers\u2019 demand, and procurement history. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The project will help improve horticulture sector productivity and value addition in line \nwith government strategy. By addressing the horticulture sector constraint of accessing long-\nterm finance, it will facilitate and spur investment in intensive water-efficient technologies for fruit \nand vegetable production and post-harvest storage, processing, and marketing facilities. This \nwill  increase  the  volume  and  enhance  the  quality  of  Uzbek  horticultural  produce  for  both \ndomestic and export markets. Expanding exports is a goal of the government\u2019s agricultural \nstrategy to 2020. Analysis of a sample of indicative production and agribusiness investments \nshows financial rates of return from 15% to 33%, suggesting these investments are viable. \n \n26.  The eight proposed PFIs have experience in lending to agriculture, with varying levels of \nagricultural  loan  portfolios.  They  have  all  been  assessed  as  financially  sound.  Financial \nprojections for the project implementation period indicate the PFIs will continue to perform well \nand comply with the Central Bank of Uzbekistan regulations and loan financial covenants. The \nmaximum value of project-financed subloans is projected to range from 0.2% to 2.2% of PFIs\u2019 \ngross loan portfolios during project implementation in 2017\u20132021. Borrowing under the project is, \ntherefore, well within the absorptive capacity of each PFI. 29 \n                                                \n28 ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n29 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n27.  Financial and integrity due diligence has been undertaken on each PFI. Based on the \ndue diligence, the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is classified as medium. An \naction plan for each PFI to address financial management issues has been prepared and will be \nimplemented up to the first quarter of 2018. A financial management assessment of RRA, the \nexecuting  agency,  did  not  identify  any  issues  that  would  adversely  affect  its  project \nmanagement role. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government, RRA, and PFIs. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The  project  supports  poverty  reduction  indirectly  through  horticulture  value  chain \ndevelopment. With 32% of the total workforce (or about 10 million people) in agriculture, the \nproject will help many horticulture farmers and entrepreneurs boost their investments, maintain \nand expand employment, and provide stable incomes for themselves and their employees and \nsuppliers. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Gender actions will help \nenhance female entrepreneurship in the horticulture sector.30 ADB conducted due diligence and \nconfirmed that core labor standards are complied within the horticulture sector.31 The loan and \nproject agreements include covenants on labor standards and safety. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n29.  The project is classified as financial intermediation for environment and category C for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous people safeguards. Subprojects that are identified in \nADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nclassified  category  A  for  environment,  and  classified  as  category  A  or  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous people safeguards are not eligible for project financing. In addition, \neligible  subprojects  will  comply  with  applicable  national  regulations.  ADB  carried  out  due \ndiligence of the PFIs\u2019 environmental and social management systems (ESMSs). All PFIs must \nhave  an  ESMS  that  satisfies  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  prior  to  the  first \ndisbursement of their respective loans.32 \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 The overall project risk is medium. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nReduced economic activity affects debt service  PFIs will carefully underwrite their lending to help \ncapacity of horticulture farmers and enterprises.  their clients achieve adequate debt service \ncapacity. \n                                                \n30  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n31  Detailed Social and Gender Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n32.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan and project agreements. As a condition to loan effectiveness, at least three \nPFIs shall have entered into a project agreement with ADB, and the government and RRA shall \nhave entered into a tripartite subsidiary loan agreement with such PFIs, in form and substance \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  Conditions  for  loan  disbursement  for  relending  to  a  PFI  includes  the \nexecution of a project agreement with ADB, a subsidiary loan agreement with the government \nand RRA, the establishment of an ESMS in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements, and the appointment of designated staff to implement the ESMS, by each PFI. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR111,585,000 to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Horticulture \nValue Chain Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge \nat the rate of 2% per annum; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n34.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal in para. 24 of this report that \ngoods, works, and consulting services procured from non-ADB member countries are eligible for \nfinancing under subloans provided to subborrowers in the Republic of Uzbekistan under the \nHorticulture Value Chain Development Project. If the requisite affirmative vote of Directors \nrepresenting not less than two-thirds of the total voting power of ADB members, pursuant to \nArticle 14(ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, is not obtained for \nthis recommendation and the Board only approves the recommendation in para. 33, then only \ngoods, works, and consulting services procured from ADB member countries will be eligible for \nfinancing  under  subloans  provided  to  subborrowers  under  the  Horticulture  Value  Chain \nDevelopment Project. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n4 November 2016", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nContribution of horticulture sector to inclusive economic growth and rural employment improved \n(Presidential Decree UP-4707)a \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  and Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \n  By 2022:     \nProduction and  a.
