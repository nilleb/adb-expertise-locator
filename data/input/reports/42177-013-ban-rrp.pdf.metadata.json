This  is  largely  fuelled  by  the  migration \nfrom rural areas of people in search of employment and trying to escape poverty and frequent \nnatural disasters. A result has been a growing number of impoverished city dwellers. Poor living \nconditions  leave  the  urban  poor,  especially  women  and  children,  more  exposed  to  health \nproblems than the general population, a vulnerability that is compounded by their lack of public \nhealth awareness and access to basic health services. The mortality rate for children under 5 in \nurban slums is 91 per 1,000 live births,3 compared with 77 per 1,000 live births in rural areas.4 \nChildren  from  the  poorest  urban  wealth  quintile  are  four  times  more  likely  to  be  chronically \nmalnourished than children from the wealthiest urban quintile.5 Among the urban poor, 70% of \nwomen  give  birth  at  home  with  the  help  only  of  untrained  traditional  birth  attendants.6 This \nexposes  them  to  a  higher  risk  of  complications.  The  2.46  fertility  rate  among  urban  slum \ndwellers is much higher than the 1.85 in non-slum areas (footnote 3). Many slum women also \nface domestic and workplace violence, which raises the need overall for women to have access \nto urgent medical attention. \n \nBecause the poor have a small asset base, sound health is essential for generating their \n4. \ndaily  income  and  subsistence.  Poor  health  not  only  limits  their  productivity  and  their \nopportunities  to  earn  and  escape  poverty  but  illness  also  often  deprives  them  of  previous \nincome gains  by forcing  them  to  spend  on  emergency  catastrophic  health care. These factors \nmake  investment  in  pro-poor  basic  health  services  and  public  health  promotion  critical  to \nreducing  urban  poverty  and  protecting  the  well-being  of  the  overall  population  in  urban  areas, \nwhich account for over 60% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition. 25 (4). pp. 479\u2013487.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  statutory  responsibility  for  the  delivery  of  PHC  in urban  areas  rests with  the  urban \n5. \nlocal bodies (ULBs), under the oversight of the Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry \nof  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  Cooperatives  (MOLGRDC).  However,  rapid \nunplanned  urbanization  has  overwhelmed  the  capacity  of  the  ULBs  to meet  the  vast  need  for \nurban PHC. The private sector is the dominant provider of basic health care in urban areas but \nthese services vary in quality and the poor often cannot afford them. Private health enterprises \ngenerally also do not provide disease preventive and health promotion services, which have low \nprofit  margins.  These  barriers,  along  with  physical,  social  and  other  factors  result  in  limited \naccess to and low use of essential health services by the urban poor.  \n \n6. \nAs  a  strategy  for  addressing  the  large  unmet  need  for  urban  PHC,  the  Government  of \nBangladesh  has  long  recognized  the  need  to  tap  nongovernment  resources  and  expertise  to \nquickly  expand  coverage  of  services  and  reach  vulnerable  communities.  In  1998,  the \ngovernment initiated a PPP pilot PHC program with support from ADB under the Urban Primary \nHealth Care Project (UPHCP I).7 UPHCP I contracted out government-financed PHC services to \nnonprofit  private  service  providers.  Under  the  contracting  arrangement,  the  private  sector \nassumes a share of financial risks tied to their  performance and cost recovery targets, as well \nas certain operational risks in delivering agreed services. ADB\u2019s project completion report on the \nUPHCP I in 20078 found the PPP approach successful, innovative, and replicable, a conclusion \nthat  was  validated  in  2008  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department.9 This  resulted  in  a \nsubsequent investment during 2005\u20132012 under the Second Urban Primary Health Care Project \n(UPHCP  II),  which  expanded  the  area  covered.10 Based  on  the  experiences  of  UPHCP  I  and \nUPHCP  II,  the  government\u2019s  five-year  plan  for  2011\u20132015  called  for  continuing  the  approach \nestablished  by  ADB\u2019s  previous  urban  PHC  projects  for  delivering  basic  health  services  to  the \nurban population.11 \n\n7. \nThe project builds on the key lessons learned from UPHCP I and UPHCP II and seek to \nfurther  enhance  related  governance  structures  and  health  service  delivery. 12  To  improve \ngovernance,  the  project  will  strengthen  the  government\u2019s  strategic  framework  for  addressing \nurban  health;  support  relevant  institutional  arrangements,  policies,  and  guidelines;  advocate \nmechanisms  to  mobilize  regular  local  revenue  for  urban  PHC;  and  support  more  direct \ninvolvement and ownership by ULBs in managing delivery of urban health services. To improve \nhealth service delivery, the project will include measures to strengthen quality, accessibility, and \nuse  of  services  so  that  they  have  a  larger  beneficial  impact  on  urban  health.  These  steps  will \ninclude  the  development  of  a  robust  quality  assurance  system,  systemized  monitoring  and \nevaluation  (M&E),  better  identification  and  targeting  of  the  poor,  better  physical  access for  the \npoor, and increased outreach activities. \n \n8. \nThe project has the following key features: (i) scaling up a pro-poor model of urban PHC \nservices delivery through PPP to cover a wider geographic area; (ii) making substantial use of \nhealth  information  technology  (IT)  to  improve  service  delivery,  training,  and  management;       \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  1997.

It  will \nreduce  urban  poverty  and  inequality,  address  a  critical  gap  in  urban  basic  services,  and \nenhance  the  basic  human  capital  and  productivity  of  the  urban  poor.  It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  202015 and  ADB\u2019s  health  operational  plan16 by  building  on  areas  where  ADB  has  a \ncomparative  advantage  and  promoting  gender  equity  and  PPP.  The  project  also  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s five-year plan commitment to developing strategic partnerships with private sector \nand nongovernment organizations that can provide support in areas that have traditionally been \nin the public sector domain and to promote PPPs as a key element of good governance.17 \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  the  improved  health  of  the  urban  population  in \nBangladesh, particularly the poor, women, and children. The outcome will be sustainable good \nquality  urban  PHC  services  provided  in  project  areas  that  target  the  poor  and  the  needs  of \nwomen and children. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n11. \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  supported  through  the  following  outputs:  (i)  strengthened \ninstitutional  governance  and  local  government  capacity  to  sustainably  deliver  urban  PHC \nservices;  (ii)  improved  accessibility,  quality,  and  utilization  of  urban  PHC  services  delivery \nsystem, with a focus on the poor, women, and children, through PPP; and (iii) effective support \nfor decentralized project management.  \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput  1:  Strengthened  Institutional  Governance  and  Local  Government \nCapacity to Sustainably Deliver Urban Primary Health Care Services \n\nSupport  for  the  Local  Government  Division.    To  assist  sustained  delivery  of  urban \n12. \nPHC,  the  project  will  support  strengthening  strategic  framework  for  urban  health  and  relevant \ninstitutional set-ups. The project will help the  LGD implement the country\u2019s draft national urban \nhealth strategy, in coordination with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW).18 The \nstrategy  will  cover  (i)  institutional  arrangements  for  urban  health  in  the  LGD,  (ii)  a  relevant \npermanent interministerial coordination structure, (iii) clarification of the mandate of the LGD in \nrelation  to  the  MOHFW  for  supporting  the  ULBs  in  carrying  out  their  urban  health \nresponsibilities,  and  (iv)  sustainable  financing  for  urban  PHC.  The  project  will  also  support \ncapacity building of the urban health unit that is being established in the LGD,19 reviewing and \nupdating  LGD  policies  and  guidelines  to  better  address  crosscutting  urban  health  issues,  and \n                                                \n13 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2011.

The LGD places a very high priority on strengthening \n13. \nlocal  government  institutions  and  providing  them  with  the  assistance  necessary  for  efficient \nprovision of locally relevant public services, including PHC for the poor. The project\u2019s support for \nstrengthening  local  government  institutions  will  target  the  ULB  health  departments,  which  are \nmainly responsible for delivering urban PHC. Through capacity building, the project will enable \nULB  health  departments  to  continue  managing  the  urban  PHC  systems  in  their  localities  after \nthe  project  ends.  This  will \ninclude  developing  reorganization  and  staffing  plans  and \nstrengthening  their  skills  in  core  project  management  and  in  PPP  contract  management  using \nthe UPHCP model. The project outcome will be made more sustainable by enhancing the ULBs\u2019 \nownership of project services and their increased allocation of resources to urban health. Over \nthe project period, participating ULBs will be required to (i) contribute at least 1% of their local \nrevenue to the urban PHC sustainability fund established by the Ministry of Finance,21 and (ii) to \ngradually increase allocations for urban PHC to at least 20% of the development block grants. \nTo  support  this  greater  allocation  of  resources  to  urban  health,  the  project  will  finance  an \nadvocacy  program  to sensitize  local  governments  and  the  local  public  to  urban  health  issues. \nThe  project  will  help  make  the  use  of  limited  local  public  expenditures  more  efficient  by \ncoordinating with the LGD to train ULBs on integrated planning and budgeting for basic social \nservices, including PHC and public and environmental health. \n \n14.  Management  systems  and  innovations.  To  support  management  systems,  learning, \nand  innovation  in  urban  PHC,  the  project  will  help  the  government  and  the  implementing \npartners  to  effectively  adapt  IT  to  manage  and  deliver  services  efficiently.  This  will  include \nsupport for a computerized health management information system that will ultimately link with \nthe  M&E  functions  of  the  LGD  and  the  MOHFW;  geographic  information  system  mapping  of \nexisting  health  facilities  in  the  partnership  agreement  areas  to  improve  referral  links;  and \nincorporation  of  e-learning  and  e-assessment  in  the  project  training  program.  The  project  will \nalso support an operations research program by reputable research institutions that will become \nknowledge hubs on urban health. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Improved  Accessibility,  Quality,  and  Utilization  of  Urban  Primary \nHealth Care Services Delivery System, with a Focus on the Poor, Women, and \nChildren, through Public\u2212Private Partnership \n\nUnder  this  output,  the  project  will  (i)  support  provision  of  PHC  services,  including \n15. \nbehavior  change  communication  (BCC),  through  partnership  agreements  with  the  nonprofit \nprivate  sector  in  30  partnership  areas  covering  all  cities  and  selected  municipalities;  and  (ii) \nstrengthen the urban PHC infrastructure network to improve physical accessibility. \n \nUrban  primary  health  care  services.  The  project  will  deliver  a  package  of  essential \n16. \nPHC  services  aligned  with  operations  of  the  MOHFW  and  include  comprehensive  emergency \nobstetrics care. The package will focus on maternal and child health, nutrition, family planning, \nand  BCC.  Better  access  to  PHC  services  and  health  information  will  bolster  the  population\u2019s \nresilience to the health related effects of climate change, given the country\u2019s great vulnerability \n\n                                                \n20 Central government support for city corporations and municipalities is through block grants and grants-in-aid from \nthe  LGD.  The  grants-in-aid  are  for  specific  activities  under  the  development  budget;  block  grants  are  for  general \nbudgetary support. These mechanisms are outside of project financing. \n\n21 The urban PHC sustainability fund was established 22 September 2008 under UPHCP II with objective to sustain \n\nPHC services in respective city corporations and municipalities following project completion. \n\n\fto natural calamities and the diseases and injuries that result, particularly among the poor.22 The \nproject will improve the accessibility, quality, and utilization of PHC services. At least 30% of all \nservices, including drugs, will be given free to the poor, with specific emphasis on women. The \nproject will also allocate additional resources to identifying and targeting the urban poor and will \ninclude  weekly  mobile  outreach  services  to  reach  the  extremely  poor  and  the  homeless \npopulation. The project will establish collaboration agreements with local partners to reach more \nof  the  impoverished  in  urban  areas  and  to  set  up  effective  referral  networks.23   It  will  work  to \nimprove  the  quality  of  PHC  through  strong  quality  assurance  mechanisms;  support  for  the \ntraining and qualification of health workers and health managers; a better supply of drugs and \nmedical  equipment;  and  introduction  of  a  small-scale  performance  incentive  scheme  and \ninnovation  fund  in  partnership  contracts  to  enhance  the  accountability  of  partners  for  their \nresults and to encourage innovations to improve service delivery.  \n \n17. \nInfrastructure  network.  The  project  will  improve  access  to  and  coverage  of  PHC \nservices  by  supporting  expansion  of  the  urban  PHC  infrastructure  network,  including  the \nconstruction of 12 comprehensive reproductive health centers and 26 PHC centers near slums \nand  other  densely  populated  areas.  This  new  infrastructure  will  be  better  designed  and  more \nfunctional than centers provided under UPHCP I and II. The upgrades will include solar power \nand  rainwater  harvesting  in  selected  facilities  to  improve  operational  efficiency  and  mitigate \nclimate change impacts. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3:  Effective Support for Decentralized Project Management \n\n18. \nThe  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  sixth  five-year  plan\u2019s  priorities  of  capacity \ndevelopment in public administration and devolution of responsibilities to local governments by \nprogressively  devolving  the  management  and  implementation  responsibilities  of  its  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  in  the  LGD  to  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  the  health \ndepartments of each project city corporation or municipal government. This will strengthen the \noversight  and  supervisory  capabilities  of  the  PMU  and  the  management  and  implementation \ncapacities of the PIUs and ultimately strengthen the project\u2019s sustainability. The project will give \nthe PMU and PIUs management and technical support in such key areas as PPP contracting, \nurban  PHC,  human  resources  development,  quality  assurance,  procurement,  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  financial  management  system  employed  under  UPHCP  II  will  be  improved \nand  computerized  under  the  project  to  minimize  fiduciary  risks  and  streamline  project \naccounting processes. The responsibilities of a training coordination cell to be established in the \nPMU  will  include  detailed  review  and  planning  of  project  capacity  development  requirements, \nstrategic  collaboration  with  other  agencies  and  training  institutes,  development  of  guidelines, \nand  implementation  of  the  training  program.  The  project  will  also  have  a  strong  performance \nand  benefits  M&E  program  that  will  include  support  for  the  health  management  information \nsystem,  routine  monitoring,  and  rigorous  evaluations  of  project  impacts  and  effectiveness \nthrough household, facility-based, and qualitative surveys. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n19. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $81 million (Table 1). \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                \n22 Several  studies  have  shown  that  Bangladesh  is  highly  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  that \n\ndiseases and a wide range of health concerns arise from the damage caused by climate change.  \n\n23 The  agreements  would  be  at  either  project  or  partnership  agreement  level  with  Bangladesh  Garment \nManufacturing Export Association, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and the United States Agency for \nInternational Development Smiling Sun Franchise Program. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n\nItem \nA.

A  PMU \nestablished under UPHCP II headed by a full-time project director will be continued in the LGD \nto  provide  the  technical,  administrative,  and  logistical  support  required  for  implementation.  An \ninterministerial  national  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  LGD  and \nestablished under UPHCP II will oversee overall project implementation. The project will create \n                                                \n24 The ADB loan will also finance transportation and insurance costs. \n25 The  United  Nations  Population  Fund  will  provide support  in  comprehensive emergency  obstetrics care  (including \nequipment  and  ambulances);  family  planning  (including  outreach,  materials,  and  BCC);  and  adolescent  sexual \nreproductive health (Project Administration Manual [accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2]).  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fPIUs  in  ULB  health  departments  to  oversee  implementation  in  project  cities  and  municipalities. \nUrban health coordination committees (UHCCs) will be set up in each project city or municipality to \ncoordinate field activities and stakeholder participation. They will be chaired by ULB chief executive \nofficers. Because cities and municipalities are divided into wards for administrative purposes, ward \nUHCCs  cochaired  by  ward  commissioners  and  zonal  health  officers  will  be  created  and  include \nrepresentation  from  local  stakeholders.  Where  standing  committees  with  similar  responsibilities \nalready exist\u2014dealing with health and water and sanitation, for example\u2014the role envisaged for the \nUHCCs may be assigned to these committees so that parallel structures are not set up. \n\nProcurement of civil works, goods, and related services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n23. \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Packages  using  national \ncompetitive  bidding  may  follow  the  government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act,  2006  and  Public \nProcurement Rules, 2008, with modifications agreed between the government and ADB, as set \nout  in  the  procurement  plan.  Consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM), which includes an indicative procurement plan. \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2017 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2012\u2013June 2017 \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement  \n\nConsulting services  \n\nNational  Project  Steering  Committee;  Secretary,  LGD  (chair);  representatives  of \nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare, project urban local bodies, Ministry of Finance, \nand Planning Commission (members) \nLGD, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development Cooperatives \nCity Corporations, municipal governments \n\nA  PMU  set  up  under  UPHCP  II  will  be  continued  within  the  LGD  with  18  proposed \nstaff. \nICB \nNCB \nShopping  \n\n30 partnership contracts \nCivil works, vehicles  \nOffice equipment, furniture \n\nFirm (QCBS, 90:10)   \nFirm (QCBS, 80:20) \nFirm (QCBS, 80:20) \nFirm (CQS) \nIndividual Consultants \n\nMonitoring and evaluation  \nBehavior change communication program \nHealth management information system \nOperations research  (2 packages) \n11 person-months, international (2 persons); \n208 person-months, national (9 persons) \n\n   $36.70 \nmillion \n$16.64 million \n$0.32 million \n$1.20 million \n$1.50 million  \n$1.15 million \n$0.50 million \n$1.17 million \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request advance contracting \nof procurement and consulting services, and may finance up to 20% of the loan  and \nthe  grant  amount  for  eligible  expenditures  for  operational  costs  incurred  in  the  12-\nmonth  period  before  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  Any  approval  of  advance \ncontracting or retroactive financing will not constitute a commitment by ADB to finance \nthe project. \nThe  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the Government of Bangladesh and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CQS  = consultant  qualification  selection,  ICB  =  international competitive bidding, \nLGD = Local Government Division,  NCB = national competitive bidding, PMU = project management unit, QCBS = \nquality- and cost-based selection, UPHCP II = Second Urban Primary Health Care Project. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n24. \nA TA of $400,000 is proposed to be attached to the project on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The TA will be implemented over 18 months and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fprovide  capacity  building  and  implementation  support  to  minimize  delays  in  project  start-up.26 \nThe LGD will be the executing agency for the TA and it will implement the TA through the PMU. \nADB will engage the consultants on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic  viability.    The project\u2019s economic viability has been assessed based on the \n25. \nassociated  benefits  and  costs.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  the  direct  benefit  for  project \nbeneficiaries in health care cost savings; and (ii) productivity gains in terms of disability adjusted \nlife  years  saved,  and  such  other  expected  benefits  as  fewer  work  days  lost  due  to  illness, \npositive externalities of immunization, and health improvements that will lead to better learning \noutcomes in school. Three major streams of economic costs are (i) the investment costs, which \ninclude  the  costs  of  constructing  and  upgrading  PHC  facilities,  of  purchasing  equipment,  of \ninstalling IT-based systems, and of providing training; (ii) indirect project-related costs, including \nthose  of  maintaining,  replacing,  and  upgrading  capital  investment,  such  as  the  costs  of \nmaintaining PHC facilities; and (iii) the operating costs of administration, wages, transport, and \nutilities.  The  project\u2019s  estimated  net  present  value  is  $17.5  million.  The  estimated  economic \ninternal rate of return is 27.8%, assuming a discount rate of 12%.  A sensitivity analysis shows \nthat  the  project  will  yield  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of  over  12%  even  with  significant \nadverse changes to key assumptions. This suggests that the project is a sound investment. \n \n26. \nFinancial  sustainability.  Financial  affordability  and  sustainability  of  the  project  has \nbeen analyzed based on the country\u2019s medium-term budgetary framework and current five-year \nplan. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of total government \nexpenditure  averages  0.08%  over  the  five-year  period.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  the \nproject will depend on several key factors: (i) cost recovery; (ii) the ability of the LGD to cover \nestimated  investments  and  associated  recurrent  expenditures  for  urban  health;  (iii)  gradual \nincreases by ULBs in their allocation for urban PHC and other pro-poor basic services to at least \n20% of the development block grants (footnote 20); and (iv) delivery of at least 1% contribution \nby each participating ULB of their annual revenue budget to the urban PHC sustainability fund \n(footnote  21).  Given  a  positive  outlook  for  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  and  government \ninvestment,  allocations for  local government  development  are expected to  increase  and urban \nhealth programming will likely receive more resources than it does now. The cost of continuing \nthe program for one year after the project ends in 2017 have been projected at Tk0.92 billion, or \n0.05%  of  total  government  expenditure.  The  government  is  projected  to  be  fiscally  able  to \nprovide this level of funding. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nProject-related governance risks have been assessed, as required by ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n27. \nfor  Implementing  the  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan  II. 27   The  assessment  found \nthat  adequate  management  system  and  staff  capacity  were  established  in  the  PMU  under \nUPHCP II and will be retained. Because this project will have greater geographic coverage and \naims  to  develop  sustainable  capacity  in  ULBs  for  delivering  basic  health  services,  the  risk \nassessment  and  management  plan  makes  several  recommendations  to  strengthen  capacity \nboth  in  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  to  improve  procedures  for  efficient \n\n                                                \n26 Details  of  the  TA  are  in  Technical  Assistance  for  Supporting  the  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Services  Delivery \n\nProject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n27 ADB. 2008. Guidelines for Implementing the Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan II. Manila. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement  and  effective  control  in  financial  management  and  procurement. 28  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  the  LGD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM and key ones are reflected in the loan covenants. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  lives  and  productivity  of  the  urban  poor  by  providing  them \nwith affordable access to basic health services. It will expand the reach of basic health services \nthrough  pro-poor  project  interventions.  These  will  include  strong  outreach  activities  to  ensure \ncommunity participation in all stages of project implementation and evaluation, social and BCC \nactivities  targeting  the  most  vulnerable  populations,  strengthened  poverty  identification  and \ntargeting, and the management of a fee-exemption system.  By focusing on women\u2019s health, the \nproject will enhance gender equity. A gender action plan has been prepared to promote gender \nequity  in  the  project  areas  by  such measures  as  (i) reducing  inequalities in  sex-disaggregated \nhealth  indicators,  and  (ii)  gender  training  and  institutional  support  while  developing  personnel \ncapacity in gender mainstreaming and monitoring project outputs. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nEnvironment. This is a category B project. The project will support construction of new \nhealthcare  centers  and  the  improvement  of  existing  facilities.  It  is  not  expected  to  have \nsignificant or irreversible negative environmental impacts during either construction or operation. \nAny environmental risks will be effectively addressed through proper mitigation measures at the \ndesign, planning, construction, and operation phases. An environment assessment and review \nframework has been prepared and disclosed because land and sites for project civil works will \nbe  identified  only  after  implementation  begins.  The  executing  agency  has  ample  institutional \ncapacity to carry out environmental safeguards and compliance measures, along with capacity \nto  manage  related  risks  and  implementation  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework. \n \n30. \nSocial  safeguards.  This  is  a  category  C  project  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples.  No  land  acquisition  will  be  involved  because  existing  unoccupied  land \nalready owned by the ULBs will be used for project\u2019s civil works. The project will use institutional \narrangements  and  assurance mechanisms  to  ensure  compliance  with  safeguard  requirements \nin  new  construction.  A  resettlement  framework  for  conducting  social  screening,  assessment, \nand stakeholder consultations is included in the PAM. Since this project covers only urban areas, \nno impact on indigenous peoples is expected. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFiduciary and fund flow. Compliance \nfinancial  management \nwith  public \nrecord-\nprocedures,  particularly  on \nkeeping,  accounting,  and \ninternal \ncontrols  is  inadequate  due  to  lack  of \nstaff  capacity  and  understanding  of \nrules.  Delayed  payment  to  contractors \nand frequent cash flow problems affect \ntimely project implementation. \n\nMitigating Measures \nA  financial  management  specialist  will  be  hired  to  improve  the  staff \ncapacity  and  financial  management  system  of  PMU  and  PIUs.  A \ncomputerized  financial  management  system  will  be  developed  to \naddress  cumbersome  manual  reconciliation  of  books.  The  PMU  will \nclosely  monitor  cash  flow  status  and  address  payment  bottlenecks  to \navoid cash flow issues and payment delays. Authority to make quarterly \npayments  for  contracts  of  partner  NGOs  will  be  delegated  to  well \nperforming implementing agencies, with post-audit done by PMU.  \n\n                                                \n28 The recommendations are summarized in the Risk Assessment and Management Plan (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nDifficult \n\nRisks \nPartnership. \nrelations \nbetween  local  governments  and  the \nNGO \nsmooth \nimplementation \npartnership \nagreements.

Recurrent \nexpenditures are inadequate to sustain \ncontracts  with  and \nservices  of \npartnership agreement NGOs after the \nproject ends. \n\nand \n\nGovernance \nanticorruption. \nGovernance  risks  are  not  improved. \nCitizen  demands  for  participation  and \ngreater \nand \naccountability from government are not \nmet.  \n\ntransparency \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  project  will  establish  a  partnership  committee  with  wide \nrepresentation from local governments and the private sector to mediate \nand ensure smooth relations between contracting parties and for fair and \ntransparent  performance  monitoring.  The  project  will  have  a  robust \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  and  quality  assurance  system  with  objective \nindicators  of  performance  to  monitor  service  delivery.  International \nconsulting services supported under the associated technical assistance \nand  a  bid  evaluation  committee  with  wide  representation \nfrom \ngovernment  agencies  and  development  partners  will  help  the  LGD \nprepare and evaluate bid documents and contracts.  \nThese  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  enhancing  ownership  of  the  project \noutcome by  urban local bodies and  their commitments to increase their \nallocations  of local  government  resources  to  urban  health; (ii)  providing \nguidelines  and  capacity  building  support  for  local  governments  to \nimprove  efficient  use  of \nthe \nimplementation  of  an  urban  heath  strategy  and  related  subsector \nframework  under  the  government\u2019s  next  five-year  plan  to  create  fiscal \nspace  and  program  planning,  as  well  as  for  mobilizing  longer-term \ncommitments of other development partners\u2019 resources. \nIn  addition  to  ensuring  awareness  of  ADB\u2019s  zero  tolerance  policy  for \nfraud and corruption, the project will make information on implementation \nprogress,  procurement,  and  recruitment  activities  public  via  a  project \nwebsite  for  enhanced  transparency,  and  accountability,  in  line  with \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011).  \n\nfinances;  and  (iii)  supporting \n\ntheir \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  LGD  =  Local  Government  Division,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  PIU  = \nproject implementation unit, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n32. \nThe government, the MOLGRDC, and the LGD have assured ADB that implementation \nof  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
