An  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken \nAssessment (Appendix 14). \nProject The  Earthquake  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (the  Project)  will \nDescription rehabilitate  and  restore  infrastructure  damaged  and  destroyed  by  the \nearthquake  of  8  October  2005  in  affected  areas  of  Azad  Jammu  and \nKashmir  (AJK)  and  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP),  thereby \nrestoring the livelihoods of affected people. The Project\u2019s design is based \non the findings of the preliminary damage and needs assessment (PDNA), \nprepared for the Government by a multidonor mission led by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank  from  24  October  to  12 \nNovember 2005.  \nThe investment component of the Project is designed as a sector project \nand will address urgently required rehabilitation and reconstruction in the \ntransport, power, and health and education sectors. The Project\u2019s quick-\ndisbursing  component  will  finance  urgently  needed  imports.  Local \ncommunities  and  beneficiaries  will  actively  participate  in  the  selection, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  all  works \ncarried out under the Project. The Project additionally addresses the needs \nof vulnerable groups, including women and children, and assists affected \npeople  by  supporting  the  reissue  of  lost  identification  cards  and  other \ndocumentation, as well as protecting their legal rights. \nRationale The 8 October 2005 earthquake was the most debilitating natural disaster \nin Pakistan\u2019s history. According to figures provided by the Government of \nPakistan, as of 3 November 2005, approximately 73,000 people had died \nand more than 70,000 were severely injured or disabled.  Over 2.8 million \npeople have been left without shelter, and 2.3 million persons are without \nadequate  food.  The  overall  cost  associated  with  the  earthquake  is \nestimated  at  $5.2  billion,  which  includes  the  costs  of  relief,  livelihood \nsupport for victims, and reconstruction. The cost of reconstructing of lost \nassets and restoring services is estimated to be $3.5 billion. Estimates \nshow the total loss in employment to be around 324,000 jobs, equal to \nabout  29%  of  the  previously employed population in the affected districts ", "ii\n  and affecting nearly 1.6 million people. Vulnerable groups are at risk of \nbecoming poorer. In particular, female-headed households, widows, and \norphaned children are at a risk of having little or no access to supplies and \nservices and of losing property claims, often because they lack proper \nidentity papers.  By providing   financing   for the most   urgently needed \ncomponents and works, the loan and grant will enable the Government to \nfinance a portion of the overall reconstruction and rehabilitation program, \nprovide assistance to vulnerable groups, and help to restore the economic \nactivity essential to the survival of residents in the heavily affected areas.   \nImpact and  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  reversing  the \nOutcome devastating impact of the earthquake and so revive economic activity and \nenable people to resume their livelihoods and return to normal life. This will \nbe achieved primarily through rehabilitating and reconstructing damaged \nand destroyed infrastructure as quickly as possible, which will particularly \nassist the poor and other vulnerable people. \nThe Project will have the following components:\n(i) Quick-disbursing component. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster\nand Emergency Assistance Policy, a portion of the proposed Project \nwill be used for quick-disbursing assistance to partly finance the \nunusually  high  and  unexpected  expenditures  required  for \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  The  quick-disbursing  component \nwill be used to finance only those imports identified as necessary for \nan  effective  recovery  program.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed on a list of permissible imports for financing under the quick-\ndisbursing facility. \n(ii) Project's sector components. In consultation with the Government, \nand  taking  into  account  the  assistance  being  proposed  by  other \ndevelopment partners, project components will finance rehabilitation \nand reconstruction in the following sectors: (a) transport; (b) power; \nand  (c)  health  and  education.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and \nreconstruct  high-priority  earthquake-damaged  educational,  health \nand road infrastructure facilities by providing civil works, equipment \nand materials. These activities will be undertaken with the adoption \nof  appropriate  and  cost-effective  earthquake-resistant  design  and \nconstruction  standards.  Civil  works  designs  will  follow  a  sector \napproach in selecting the highest-priority subprojects. This will allow \na quick response and maximum flexibility regarding both geographic \ncoverage  and  the  selection  of  subprojects,  within  an  agreed \nframework and criteria.  \n(iii)  Implementation  assistance.  Consulting  services  will  include \nservices  for  project  design,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. Legal assistance, governance, and institutional building \nsubcomponents  will  be  used  to  address  governance,  legal,  and \ndocumentary issues arising from the earthquake\u2019s impact. ", "  iii\nCost Estimates  The estimated cost of the Project is $374.2 million equivalent. For the \nProject\u2019s sector components, the Government will contribute 24% of the \nestimated cost of reconstruction and rehabilitation, mainly in the form of \ntaxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition,  rehabilitation,  resettlement,  and \nadministrative support. As a sector approach is being followed, the cost \nestimates are broken down by sectors. \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a grant of $80 million from the Pakistan Earthquake Fund, \nand a loan of $220 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources\u2014as Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) loan\u2014to finance the Project.  \nThis  covers  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  (except  interest  during \nimplementation) of $236.3 million, as well as $63.7 million equivalent of \nlocal currency cost. \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent\nExchange  Currency  Cost\nA.

In \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the \nloan will have a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, an \ninterest  rate  of  1%  per  annum,  and  repayment  of  principal  at  2%  per \nannum for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per annum \nthereafter.\nAllocation and  The Government will make the loan and the grant proceeds of the Project \nRelending available to the governments of AJK and NWFP in accordance with the \nTerms existing policies and practices of the Government or any changes approved \nby the Government\u2019s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). Likewise, \na  portion  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to \nPeshawar Electricity Supply Company (PESCO) and Islamabad Electricity \nSupply Company (IESCO) in accordance with the existing policies of the \nGovernment or any changes approved by the Government\u2019s ECC. The \nGovernment  will  bear  all  foreign  exchange  risk.  In  addition,  the  \nGovernment  will  provide   required counterpart funds for implementing the ", "iv\nProject to the governments of AJK and NWFP, IESCO, and PESCO in a \ntimely manner and on a grant basis. \nPeriod of  30 June 2009 \nUtilization\nEstimated 31 December 2008 \nProject\nCompletion\nDate\nImplementation The  Earthquake  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Authority  (ERRA) \nArrangements  established by presidential decree, in response to the 8 October 2005 \nmassive earthquake, will be the executing agency for the Project. The \nmechanisms  and  implementation  strategies,  institutional  framework  and \nrelated terms of reference for the recovery efforts under the umbrella of \nERRA are still being developed. Based on current understanding of ERRA \nfunctions, the authority is expected to facilitate, guide, coordinate, approve \nand  monitor  the  reconstruction  effort,  develop  the  overall  policy  and \nplanning  framework  for  the  reconstruction  effort,  standard  setting  and \nquality control and manage the operation and accounting of rehabilitation \nand reconstruction funds. ERRA is also expected to lead revision of the \ncurrent arrangements for subproject approval, implementation and fund \nflow to simplify procedures and so ensure quick implementation and full \ntransparency. ERRA\u2019s Governing Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, \nwill approve overall programs and large work packages, basically fulfilling \nthe role of the Central Departmental Working Party in normal development \nprojects, but with a much shorter timeframe. ERRA\u2019s Board will oversee the \nimplementation of the Project through provincial and district line agencies \nfollowing current/revised procedures but on a fact-track basis. ERRA will \nalso approve major changes in the scope and cost of the subprojects, \nannual  plans  and  budgets,  and  support  the  Project\u2019s  implementing \nagencies with financial and technical management.  \nERRA  will  be  staffed  by  various  specialist  professionals  deputed  from \nrelevant  government  departments  (including  those  of  the  federal \nGovernment and other provinces) and hired from the private sector as \nnecessary for ERRA to carry out its functions. Periodic social and technical \nmonitoring, regular review, and overall fund flow and internal audits of the \nProject will be carried out by ERRA. The Controller General of Accounts \n(CGA) will prescribe the related procedures and requirements for fiduciary \nmonitoring. The AJK and NWFP implementing agencies will develop the \nsubprojects following the selection criteria and social compliance, through \npublic consultation as outlined in Appendix 10, which will be formalized in \nan operational manual to be prepared by ERRA.  \nThe Governments of AJK and NWFP, through their steering committees \n(SCs) specially constituted for the purpose of reconstruction in the quake \naffected areas, chaired by the Additional Chief Secretaries of AJK and \nNWFP and having representation of ERRA, provincial line departments and \nthe  district  governments (in case of NWFP), will  be  responsible  for  over ", "  v\nseeing  the  provincial  planning  and  implementation  of  subcomponents. \nThese  committees  will  be  supported  by  professionally  staffed \nreconstruction agencies (RA)\u2014the NWFP Reconstruction Agency and the \nAJK Reconstruction Agency, containing various specialist staff, will be for \nimplementation of subprojects for which capacity does not exist at with \nprovincial  and  district  line  departments  contracted  as  decided  by  the \nrespective steering committees of NWFP and AJK.  RAs will design and \napprove subprojects falling within the powers delegated to the RA by the \nprovincial Government and within the overall annual budget and work plan \napproved by ERRA.  The steering committees and ERRA will approve sub \nprojects, work plans, budgets and provide overall guidance, in line with \nemergency procedures to be put in place by the ERRA Council and/or \nBoard.  For  the  subprojects  implemented  through  the  provincial  line \ndepartments/implementing agencies, and the district governments, where \ntechnical  capacity  exists  as  decided  by  the  respective  SCs,  additional \nsupport will be provided by deputing staff and by appointment of additional \nexpertise  as  required  to  meet  the  additional  work  load  and  fast  track \nrequirements,  due  diligence  and  reporting.  The  ERRA,  RAs,  and  line \ndepartments staff requirements, and related operating costs, will be funded \nthrough  incremental  administration  support,  supported  in  part  by  ADB \ngrant.\nThe district advisory committees (DACs)/district development committees \n(DDCs) headed by district coordination officer (DCO) or Nazims in NWFP \nand deputy commissioners in AJK, will be responsible for the identification \nof  subprojects  and  needs,  and  recommend  plans  for  approval  of  the \nsteering committees. These plans will be approved annually by the steering \ncommittees or ERRA and implemented through RA (through their district \nreconstruction  units),  line  departments  and  district  governments,  as \nrecommended bv SCs. Implementing agencies additional incremental staff \nand  overhead  cost  for  subproject  implementation,  and  technical \nbackstopping and technical assistance support for implementing agencies \nto plan, design, supervise and implement the subprojects, will be financed \nby the Project. \nFinancial The Ministry of Finance will manage the multidonor Consolidated Fund for \nManagement  the Emergency Earthquake Assistance established in the State Bank of \nPakistan (SBP) through which the project funds will flow. ERRA is putting in \nplace the related fiduciary arrangements to ensure transparency in funds \nflow,  financial  management,  accounting,  internal  control  processes, \nprocurement,  periodic  financial  reporting,  monitoring  and  internal  and \nexternal audits. The CGA will provide the related guidelines, and ensure \nthat all relevant Government statutory provisions and prudent regulations \nare followed. Disbursement of project funds will generally follow existing \naccounting procedures. The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) will be \nresponsible  for  determining  the  appropriate  auditing  arrangements  and \nensuring the timely completion of audits conducted in accordance with \ninternationally accepted auditing practices.   ", "vi\nThe Project funds will be disbursed through the Consolidated Fund in SBP, \nto the imprest account operated by the fund manager\u2014the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) for the quick-disbursing components and ERRA for the \nother components\u2014to finance components of the Project. MOF will make \nbudget allocations for counterpart funds in the budget, and release the \nGovernment\u2019s counterpart share as a grant in a separate account operated \nby the fund manager in the form of budget allocation, as a grant, released \nfrom  the  MOF  to  the  ERRA  Fund  (a  special  deposit  fund  in  public \naccount\u2014assignment  account).  The  ADB  funds  for  the  Project,  and \nGovernment\u2019s counterpart funds will be released to ERRA as executing \nagency (excluding quick-disbursing component, for which MOF will be the \nexecuting agency). ERRA will maintain separate accounts for ADB loan \nand grant (imprested accounts), the Government counterpart funds and will \nrelease funds to the respective implementing agencies (second generation \nimprest accounts) as advances against approved budget/work plan at the \nfederal,  provincial  and  district  levels.  All  funds  will  be  utilized  for  their \nintended  purposes  as  per  the  financing  plan,  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedures set down by CGA and ERRA. ADB funds will be issued with \nspecified codes for the rehabilitation and reconstruction program, and all \npayments and disbursements will be made based on those codes. A fund \nflow arrangement is in Appendix 9. \nERRA  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  financial  and  physical  progress \nreports, as well as annually audited financial statements, of the use of \ndonor and ADB funds. Given the magnitude of funds, which will be passing \nthrough ERRA, the MOF has already proposed that ERRA should establish \nperiodic internal audits and reviews mechanisms, in consultation with other \ndonors and ADB. These will provide systemic feedback to improve financial \nmanagement,  fund  flow  timeliness,  accountability  and  transparency. \nProject imprest accounts will be operated in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). AGP will nominate private \nchartered accountants, if required, to meet the increased burden on CGA \nand to demonstrate transparency.\nAll  donor  funds  channeled  through  ERRA  will  be  subject  to  the  same \noperating  procedures  and  processes,  provided  as  Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  Based  on  the  preliminary  assessment  and  subject  to \nfinalization  of  implementation  and  financial  management  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  the  financial  management  arrangements  for  the \nProject are found to be satisfactory.  ", "  vii\nExecuting and  ERRA  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  MOF  will  be  the \nImplementing executing agency for the quick-disbursing component. In order to fast-track \nAgencies the Project, ERRA is located within the Prime Minister\u2019s Secretariat and \nhas been mandated with extraordinary authority to expedite the recovery, \nreconstruction, and rehabilitation in the earthquake-affected areas. ERRA\u2019s \nGoverning Council consists of the Prime Minister of Pakistan (Chair), the \nprime minister for AJK, the chief minister of NWFP, minister for Kashmir \nAffairs  and  Northern  Areas,  advisor  to  the  Prime  Minister  of  Pakistan, \ndeputy chairman of the Planning Commission, and the chairman of ERRA. \nUnder ERRA, the implementing agencies for the Project will be (i) NWFP \nReconstruction Authority, (ii) AJK Reconstruction Authority, (iii) PESCO, \nand (iv) IESCO. In NWFP and AJK, the various line departments will also \nbe  the  implementing  agencies  as  well  as  Sarhad  Hydro  Development \nOrganization (SHYDO), which come under NWFP Irrigation and Power \nDepartment and the Frontier Highways Authority (FHA) which comes under \nthe NWFP Works and Services. The steering committees established for \nthe  purpose,  chaired  by  the  respective  Additional  Chief  Secretary  and \nhaving representation from ERRA, provincial line departments and districts \nwill decide about the existence or otherwise of sufficient capacity for the \npurpose of implementation of the subprojects. The implementation of the \nProject will generally follow procedures already in place for ADB-financed \nprojects, but will be supported by additional fast-track mechanisms and \nfund flow due diligence provided by ERRA. \nProcurement  Given  the  urgent  Project  needs,  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and \nservices will be carried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and \nexpedient procedures under the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy  and  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  contemplated \nimplementation schedule. Local competitive bidding procedures will be the \npreferred mode of procurement. Basically, the procurement procedures as \nthat already in place with the various line agencies for ongoing ADB loans \nare  simplified  as  allowed  under  the  special  procedures  for  emergency \nlending. The procurement of goods and related services estimated to cost \nmore than $1 million will be procured following international competitive \nbidding procedures. International shopping procedures will be followed for \nprocurement of goods and related services estimated at between $100,000 \nand $1 million. For small, specialized equipment and materials contracts \nvalued at less than $100,000, direct procurement procedures acceptable to \nADB  will  be  followed. Due to the urgent nature of this Project, the bidding \nperiod for international competitive bidding will be shortened to 30 days \nand, for local competitive bidding, to 14 days. Civil works contracts worth \nover $5 million will be procured through international competitive bidding, \nand those estimated to cost $5 million or less will be procured through local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Community \nparticipation  in  the  procurement  of  small  works  of  a  simple  nature  is \nencouraged. ", "viii\nFor the quick-disbursing component, all items on the positive list imported \nby the Government, including packages procured by private entities on \nbehalf of the Government, following normal local commercial procedures \nfor the private sector and standard Government procurement procedures \nfor the public sector procurement, where such procedures are functioning \nand appropriate and acceptable to ADB, are eligible. \nConsulting The implementation of the earthquake reconstruction program will more \nServices than double the normal level of development activities in NWFP and AJK, \nputting  unprecedented  stress  on  the  responsible  agencies.  The  most \nefficient  way  to  boost  their  human  and  skills  capacity  is  to  recruit \nexperienced  consultants.  This  implementation  support,  will  take  three \nforms:  (i)  legal  assistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building  ($2.5 \nmillion);  (ii)  incremental  administrative  support  ($5  million);  and  (iii) \nconsulting services ($7.5 million). All the implementation support will be \nfunded from the ADB grant proceeds. All consulting firms and individual \ninternational  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB. As the rehabilitation and reconstruction work to be financed under \nthe Project must be completed within 36 months due to its urgent nature, \nexpeditious selection and fielding of consultants is necessary. Accordingly, \nERRA and the executing and implementing agencies may recruit directly \nfrom consultants already engaged on ADB-financed projects in Pakistan \nand now providing services similar to those required for the Project. This \narrangement will provide an efficient way to recruit consultants under the \ncircumstances. In any other cases, the consulting services from firms will \nbe  provided  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  using  simplified \ntechnical proposals. Individual consultants will be procured through ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for the recruitment of individual consultants. \nProject Benefits  The Project will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to regenerate the \nand economy,  rehabilitate  public  infrastructure  and  utilities,  and  generate \nBeneficiaries employment. Priority will be given to providing work for earthquake-affected \npeople,  including  women,  to  help  reestablish  their  livelihoods.  The \nrehabilitation  of  damaged  and  lost  infrastructure,  particularly  road  and \npower infrastructure will improve the quality of life and revive economic \nactivities. Reconstruction of education and healthcare facilities will offer \nlong-term benefits for affected people.  \nThe legal assistance, governance, and institutional building subcomponent, \nwhich is an important part of reconstruction, will also support improvements \nin gender mainstreaming and the elimination of legal discrimination and \ncultural  marginalization.  Orphans,  female  heads  of  households,  and \nwidowers will be trained in new social and income-earning roles to improve \nthe  well-being  of  their  families.  No  major  resettlement  impacts  are \nenvisaged under the Project. Restoration of the means of livelihood of poor \npeople who were farmers and shepherds, on government land or other \nland  not  privately  held  will  be  addressed.  Any  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  Government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.", "  ix\nThe Project\u2019s initial environmental examination (IEE) determined that it is a \ncategory B project. The environmental assessment and review framework \nprovides the procedures to be followed for a sector loan modality. Based \non  the  Project\u2019s  initial  environmental  examination,  the  environmental \nimpacts will be mostly limited to construction related aspects, of which the \ndisposal of millions of tons of rubble is the major issue. These impacts will \nbe mitigated through careful construction procedures. \nRisks and  The four major overarching risks for the Project include the physical risks \nAssumptions associated  with  unstable  mountain  slopes,  problems  of  access  and \nlogistics,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  such  a  massive \nreconstruction effort in a reasonable timeframe, and the local government\u2019s \ncapacity to properly operate and maintain the new facilities. The physical \nand  logistical  risks  include  (i)  aftershocks  causing  further  damage  to \nalready weakened structures and infrastructure; (ii) landslides that could \ncause  delays  in  restoration  of  services  and  reconstruction;  (iii)  remote \nlocations and difficult topography that make any reconstruction  logistically \ndifficult; (iv) high elevations in some areas that will limit reconstruction to a \nfew  months  in  the  summer  season,  (iv)  massive  relief  operations  and \ntemporary  housing  camps  that  could  hinder  or  delay  reconstruction, \nespecially in the vicinity of the larger towns; and (v) lack of available land \nfor infrastructure. \nThe government\u2019s capacity in NWFP, and especially in AJK are severely \nweakened by the loss of many of their own buildings, facilities, and staff \nmembers. Compounding the difficulties is their relative lack of experience \nwith externally funded projects, which constitutes another risk. Substantial \nstrengthening  will  need  to  be  done  to  enable  them  to  fast-track  the \nemergency reconstruction works. The Government has established ERRA \nand has mandated it with extraordinary authority to open bottlenecks in \ncurrent procedures and so fast-track implementation.  \nPhysical risks will be mitigated by relocating roads, bridges, electrical lines, \nhuman habitations and other infrastructure away from the existing and \npotentially unstable slopes and/or new slide areas. All new facilities will \nincorporate  earthquake  strengthening  and  other  damage-mitigation \nmeasures.  Logistics  of  access  and  climate  will  be  addressed  through \nprioritization of reconstruction requirements so that for this Project only \nworks  that  can  realistically  be  completed  in  the  3-year  timeframe  are \nincluded. ERRA, the executing and implementing agencies, in addition to \nthe normal project consultants, will be supported by specialists recruited, \nfrom the private sector to strengthen the government\u2019s own staff, and to \nensure  that  they  can  attract  quality  personnel.  The  implementation \nassistance  component  will  finance  this  specialized  help,  estimated  to \ninclude more than 700 person-months. ", "x\nThe  Government  has  indicated  that  the  usual  counterpart  funding \nrequirement from the local governments will be waived for this emergency \nproject, as counterpart funding will be paid by the central government. \nSimilarly,  the  Government  is  aware  of  the  need  to  provide  operating \nsupport to some local utilities, education and health facilities, and electricity \ndistribution companies until their normal revenue sources can be restored.  \nImplementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of  quality \nsubprojects in the various project sectors will be mitigated in several ways. \nFirst, detailed subproject criteria will be developed, in addition to general \nsubproject  selection  criteria  already  agreed  to.  Second,  in  terms  of \nimplementation,  specific  monitoring  mechanisms  will  include  regular \nfinancial audits as well as regular design and construction supervision and \nperformance audits through random audits and special post-completion \naudits.\nTechnical Given  the  relatively  high  degree  of  fiduciary  risk  associated  with  this \nAssistance Project, and the extraordinary challenges over the Office of the AGP and \nthe office of the CGA, which are created by this Project as well as by other \ndonor Projects, ADB will ensure that these agencies will be provided with \nadequate resources to meet their fiduciary responsibilities. In conjunction \nwith the Project, a technical assistance (TA) is proposed for building the \ncapacity of the office of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) and the \noffice of the CGA. The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which ADB \nwill finance $2.0 million on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe TA includes provision of 192 person-months domestic and 9 person-\nmonths  international  consultant.  Consultants  will  provide  training  and \ntechnical advice in various aspects of audit, accounts and performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  AGP  and  CGA  will  be  the  executing \nagencies for the TA. The proposed TA is scheduled to be implemented for \n36 months from January 2006 to January 2009.  Administration of the \nproposed TA will be delegated to ADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission. ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant and loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Earthquake Emergency Assistance \nProject (the Project), and (ii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for the \nOffice of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP). The Project will assist the early reconstruction \nof damaged infrastructure and restore livelihoods that were severely affected by the earthquake \nof 8 October 2005. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Natural Disasters in Pakistan and the Region \n2.  The  northern  parts  of  South  Asia  have  a  history  of  earthquakes  arising  from  its \ngeological and tectonic history. The basic geological fact is that the Euro-Asian Plate is colliding \nwith  the  Indian  Plate  along  an  alignment  that  more  or  less  coincides  with  the  Himalayan \nMountains.  Earthquakes  of  low  magnitudes  occur  from  time  to  time  in  this  area  as  the \nsubduction of the Indian Plate continues. An occasional high-magnitude earthquake occurs \nwhen there is a sudden release of energy in this process. Accurate forecasting of earthquakes \nis very difficult, if not impossible, with current technologies. In the province of Balochistan, the \nearthquake of 1935 is well documented and it killed some 26,000 people. Taking into account all \nnatural disasters that the country has experienced, the earthquake of 8 October 2005 is clearly \nthe worst in terms of deaths, injuries, property loss, and damage to infrastructure. \nB.  Impact of the Earthquake on Northern Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir  \n3.  On 8 October 2005, at 8:50 a.m. Pakistan Standard Time, an earthquake measuring 7.6 \non  the  Richter  scale  was  recorded  in  Pakistan,  Afghanistan,  and  India.  The  earthquake\u2019s \nepicenter was 100 kilometers north-northeast of Islamabad, along the fault line where the Indian \nPlate meets the Eurasian Plate. Tremors were felt across a wide swath of South Asia, from \ncentral Afghanistan to western Bangladesh. As of 27 October 2005, the Geological Survey of \nPakistan registered more than 1,000 aftershocks, many of which ranged from 5.0 to 6.0 on the \nRichter scale.  \n4.  Lasting  for  about  2  minutes,  the  8  October  2005  earthquake  is  arguably  the  most \ndebilitating  natural  disaster  in  Pakistan\u2019s  history.  Pakistan-administered  Azad  Jammu  and \nKashmir (AJK)1 and the eastern districts of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) bore the \nfull force of the earthquake in terms of number of lives lost, injuries sustained, and destruction of \ninfrastructure and economic assets. Substantial public and private assets in social services \ndelivery, governance, commerce, communications, and shelter were either badly damaged or \ndestroyed in at least three districts of AJK and five districts of NWFP. \n5.  According  to  the  figures  provided  by  the  Government,  as  of  3  November  2005, \napproximately 73,000 people had died and more than 70,000 were severely injured or disabled. \nOver 2.8 million people have been left without shelter, and it is estimated that about 2.3 million \npersons are without adequate food primarily due to the disruption of the transport system and \nloss of stored food. The terrain in affected areas of both NWFP and AJK is highly diversified and \n                                                \n1  Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is an area over which India and Pakistan have been in dispute since 1947.  ADB \ndoes not intend to make any judgment as to the legal or other status of any disputed territories or  to prejudice the \nfinal determination of the parties\u2019 claims. ", "2\nincludes densely populated areas as well as rugged, mountainous areas with small, dispersed \nrural  settlements.  Official  estimates  of  the  damage  remain  conservative  as  many  isolated \ncommunities  in  the  earthquake-affected  region  remain  inaccessible, which  foreshadows  an \nincrease in official figures as these areas are eventually reached. Furthermore, the United \nNations has issued a warning indicating that more lives will be lost if additional relief does not \nmaterialize before the imminent onset of the Himalayan winter. \n6.  Many  government  buildings\u2014including  hospitals;  health  clinics;  provincial  and  local \ngovernment  administration  offices;  police,  judiciary  and  penal  facilities;  and  schools  and \ncolleges\u2014were destroyed or severely damaged. The earthquake has had a devastating impact \non the delivery of all social services in the affected areas. The most seriously affected sectors \nare transport, health and education, power, and water supply and sanitation. They have suffered \nnot only destruction or serious damage to physical facilities, but also through the death or \nserious injury of care providers including nurses, doctors, health workers, teachers, and schools \nstaff.\nC.  The Government\u2019s Response\n7.  The  Government  responded  quickly  to  the  earthquake  emergency.  Although \ncommunications with the most severely affected areas and populations were severed, the \nPresident and Prime Minister visited affected sites the first day after the disaster. Two army \ndivisions moved into NWFP and AJK and set up five advanced staging posts to facilitate the \ndistribution of relief goods. The geography of some affected areas has led the Government to \ncall for an unprecedented number of helicopters to assist with the distribution of relief goods. As \nof 2 November 2005, a fleet of more than 125 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, both foreign \nand domestic, have made over 5,000 sorties to affected areas.   \n8.  The Prime Minister has outlined a 12-point national strategy for reconstruction and \nrehabilitation. The Prime Minister\u2019s office has appointed a Federal Relief Commission and \ncorresponding  relief  coordinator,  with  the  overall  responsibility  for  overseeing  relief  efforts \ntargeting shelter, food, clean water, and immediate medical care.  At the district and grassroots \nlevels, military relief personnel have been stationed to facilitate the distribution of relief goods. \nFurthermore, the President has established an Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation \nAuthority (ERRA) to facilitate the rebuilding and repair of damaged infrastructure, including \nhousing, roads, bridges, government buildings, schools, and hospitals.   \n9.  As of 11 November 2005, the Government had distributed 350,000 tents, 3.2 million \nblankets, and 3,000 tons of medicine, and had established tent villages for earthquake-affected \npersons.  The  Government  has  made  available  army  medical  teams  comprised  of  medical \nofficers and paramedics in at least 13 stations in and around the affected districts of AJK and \nNWFP.  The  Government  has  also  announced  a  program  that  includes  compensation  of \nPRs100,000  for  each  family  that  has  lost  members,  PRs50,000  for  each  individual  who \nsustained serious injury, and PRs25,000 for each individual with minor injuries. The maximum \namount  of  assistance  given  to  each  family  under  this  program  is  PRs500,000,  and \ndisbursements have already begun. \nD.  Needs Assessment \n10.  At the request of the Government, a mission led by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand  the  World  Bank  conducted  a  preliminary  damage  and  needs  assessment  (PDNA)  to \nestimate the scale of damage caused by the 8 October 2005 earthquake. Experts from other ", "  3\ninternational  organizations,  including  the  European  Union,  Department  for  International \nDevelopment, United Kingdom, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  Food  and \nAgricultural  Organization  (FAO)  of  the  United  Nations,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other United Nations (UN) \nagencies also participated in this assessment. Team members visited the nine most heavily \naffected districts of Abbottabad, Battagram, Kohistan, Mansehra, and Shangla in NWFP and \nBagh, Neelum, Muzaffarabad, and Poonch in AJK to verify and evaluate the intensity of disaster \ndamage  and  to  meet  with  both  civil  administration  authorities  and  people  from  affected \ncommunities.  The  assessment  team  also  met  with  a  range  of  civil  society,  international, \ngovernmental  and  development  partner  organizations  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  full \nspectrum  of  issues  that  are  likely  to  influence  the  recovery  strategy.  The  major  donors\u2019 \nconference in Islamabad on 19 November 2005 further defined the final breakdown of donors\u2019 \nsectoral responsibilities.  \n11.  The PDNA began on 24 October 2005 and concluded on 12 November 2005. It has \nbeen revised based on comments received from the Government and other stakeholders. The \nGovernment  endorsed  the  findings  of  the  report  on  11  November  2005.  Appendix  2  is  a \nsummary of the PDNA, which is available in full as Supplementary Appendix A. The ADB \nwebsite (www.adb.org) offers relevant publications. \nE.  Impact of the Earthquake \n12.  The overall cost associated with the earthquake is estimated at approximately $5.2 \nbillion,  which  includes  estimated  costs  for  relief,  livelihood  support  for  victims,  and \nreconstruction. The cost of reconstructing lost assets and restoring services is estimated to be \nPRs208.1 billion ($3.5 billion). \n1.  Estimated Damages and Reconstruction Costs  \n13. Direct  Damage.    Preliminary  estimates  of  direct  damage  sustained  due  to  the \nearthquake total to PRs135.1 billion ($2.3 billion), as presented in Table 1. These estimates are \nbased on the book value of the assets. The largest component is private housing, which \namounts to PRs61.2 billion ($1.03 billion), followed by transport sector totaling PRs20.2 billion \n($340  million),  and  to  the  education  sector  equaling  PRs19.9 billion  ($335  million).  Direct \ndamage to agriculture and livestock is also sizeable, totaling PRs12.9 billion ($218 million). The \nlosses to industry and services amount to PRs8.6 billion ($144 million).\n14.  The level of direct damage is worse in AJK than in NWFP. For AJK, it amounts to \nPRs76.4 billion ($1.3 billion) and for NWFP, PRs56.4 billion ($950 million). In most sectors, the \ndestruction of physical assets in AJK is greater than that in NWFP. \n15. Indirect Losses. The indirect losses resulting from the direct damage are PRs34.2 \nbillion ($576 million). The indirect losses are comparable in absolute values between NWFP and \nAJK. The estimated indirect losses do not take into account the beneficial effect of rehabilitation \nand reconstruction activities on future output. Reconstruction will not only restore physical \nassets but also permit improved production of goods and services. Hence, the estimates of \nindirect losses presented above are likely to be on the higher side in the case of output losses. \n16. Reconstruction  Costs. The cost of reconstruction of lost assets and restoration of \npublic services is estimated at PRs208 billion ($3.5 billion).  Reconstruction costs are valued at ", "4\nimproved standard replacement rate, including the cost of rebuilding to earthquake-resistant \nstandards in a manner suitable to local conditions.  This is necessary given the high degree of \nexposure to future natural disasters in the affected areas. \nTable 1: Preliminary Estimate of Total Losses and Reconstruction Costs  \nShare of \nDirect Indirect  Reconstruction  Reconstruction \nTotal \nDamage  Losses  Costsa Costsa\nSector Reconst. \n(PRs million)  (PRs million) (PRs million)  ($ million)  \nCosts (%) \nA.

Macroeconomic Impact \n17.  The impact of the earthquake on Pakistan\u2019s official gross domestic product (GDP), which \nexcludes GDP from AJK, is expected to be limited to about 0.4%. In fiscal year (FY) 2006, GDP \ngrowth was projected in June at 7%, with recent data suggesting the growth will be around 6.5%. \nThe additional impact of the earthquake is likely to bring output growth further down, to around \n6.1%.2  This loss is due to a projected reduction in NWFP output in FY2006. In addition, the \noutput loss in AJK could amount to PRs76.4 billion ($297 million), or 27% of AJK\u2019s 2004\u201305 \noutput. As reconstruction activity starts, the impact on GDP growth could actually be positive, \nfelt mostly in FY2007 and FY2008. \n18.  At the macroeconomic level, the most significant impact of the earthquake is expected to \nbe on the fiscal deficit of the Government. In the absence of any offsetting revenue increases \n                                                \n2 This assumes that all of the income loss will fall in fiscal year 2006, an assumption that may overstate the impact of \nthe earthquake on growth.  ", "  5\nand expenditure reductions, the earthquake is projected to increase the FY2006 deficit of the \nGovernment between 0.6% and 1.0% of GDP. The budgets of NWFP and AJK will be unable to \naccommodate a significant share of the relief and reconstruction expenditures, although it is to \nbe expected (and desirable) that they would have significant role in the reconstruction process. \n19.  The  earthquake  has  now  created  additional  expenditure  needs  to  cover  for  relief, \nreconstruction, and rehabilitation costs. These pressures could pose difficulties for Pakistan\u2019s \nmacroeconomic balances and may undermine the achievement of its long-term development \ngoals,  unless  additional  concessional  financing  is  made  available  by  the  international \ncommunity. A key element of the Pakistan\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is the utilization \nof the additional fiscal space created by prudent fiscal policy and aid to meet development and \npoverty-reduction  objectives.  It  is,  therefore,  important  that  priority  public  expenditures  be \nprotected, so that Pakistan can continue to improve service delivery of health, education, and \npublic infrastructure. The Government has indicated that it would be prepared to absorb a part \nof the budgetary impact of the earthquake by making cuts in low-priority expenditures and \nraising additional domestic revenue. These adjustments would be needed irrespective of the \namount and type of financing that the donor community would provide. However, given the \nlimited magnitude of resources for rehabilitation of the affected areas, it is unlikely that the \nGovernment will be able to fully absorb the fiscal impact of the earthquake without significantly \naffecting public sector development activities.  \n20.   Pressure on the external trade balance has arisen from strong aggregate demand and \nfactors not directly related to the earthquake.  The earthquake may cause an increase (albeit \nlimited) in imports of fuel, food, and construction materials. A delay in aid inflows to finance the \nGovernment\u2019s earthquake expenditures would aggravate pressure on balance of payments. \n  3.  Social, Poverty, Environment, and Livelihood Impact  \n21. Social Impact. The earthquake has so far claimed more than 73,000 lives, while 70,000 \nare injured and 2.8 million left homeless. In addition to the immense damage and loss of life, the \nearthquake increased vulnerabilities among the surviving population. In particular, the factors \ncreating new vulnerabilities or contributing to existing ones include internal displacement and \nmarginalization based on gender, age, and disabilities. \n22.  Marginalized and vulnerable groups may not be able to access emergency assistance \non an equal basis with others. In particular, female-headed households, widows, and orphaned \nchildren are at risk of (i) having little or no access to supplies and services and (ii) losing \nproperty claims owing to their lack of proper identity papers. Many elderly and disabled are likely \nto  have  lost  their  support  network.  Physical  and  psychological  disabilities  suffered  as  a \nconsequence of the earthquake need to be taken into account, as they incur lasting liabilities in \nterms of economic costs and social exclusion. Long-term health expenses and rehabilitation will \nbe important burdens on families and the Government alike.  \n23.  The new poor, created by the disaster, may also face financial problems and social \npressure if they are unable to repay formal or informal loans obtained before the earthquake. \n24.  The health and nutrition of the vulnerable people are threatened by a diminished and \nunbalanced diet.  \n25. Poverty. The earthquake-affected areas were not the poorest in Pakistan, but they were, ", "6\neven before the earthquake, among the most vulnerable. Geographical remoteness and a harsh \nclimate have made these areas particularly vulnerable to sudden disasters. \n26.  Of the total of 2.4 million people employed at the time of the earthquake, almost 84% \nwere living below the poverty line of $2 per day. In addition, women and youths in the affected \nprovinces had difficulty finding employment.  \n27.  The depletion and degradation of natural resources have been particularly severe in the \nearthquake-affected areas. The reduction in average land availability per household due to land \nfragmentation, erosion, and landslides has resulted in households becoming increasingly poorer. \nDemographic pressure and price increases have also worsened vulnerable groups\u2019 exposure to \npoverty.\n28.  Most of the jobs in the affected provinces are in relatively less productive sectors, \nparticularly agriculture, livestock, and informal services. These sectors are without social safety \nnets and supplemented by secondary income sources (such as off-farm jobs) and remittances. \nThus, the loss of employment, even for a short time, is likely to precipitate a decline into \nconditions of extreme poverty for many families.  \n 29.  The vulnerable groups described in the previous section are at risk of becoming poorer. \nThe situation is particularly critical for children, many of whom may be orphaned, homeless, and \nout of school, which may force them to seek alternative forms of support. Without help, poverty \namong  these  groups  will  constantly  grow,  with  little  hope  for  the  future.  A  social  security \nmechanism should be put place for the survival of people who are not able to provide for \nthemselves.\n30. Environment. The earthquake has damaged the environment. Impacts on ecosystems \nare often less dramatic than structural damage due to their slower manifestation. Considering \nthat  the  environment  of  the  affected  area  was  vulnerable  even  before  the  earthquake, \ncomprising fragile mountain ecosystems, significant long-term adverse impacts are likely. A \ndetailed environmental assessment of the impacts of the earthquake is urgently needed to \nquantify losses to forest, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems, including biodiversity, and to \nrestore damaged ecosystems.\n31.  The most visible consequence of the earthquake is the enormous quantity of debris and \nrubble from damaged and destroyed structures. Preliminary estimates indicate that up to 200 \nmillion tons of rubble may need disposal.  \n32.  The main environmental impacts from the earthquake resulted from landslides. While the \nexposed soil surfaces now appear to be in a state of equilibrium, a second phase of landslides \nis likely, and largely unpreventable, with the onset of seasonal rains and the melting of snow in \nthe spring. The loss of forest cover over the last decade due to encroachment, illegal timber \nfelling, and agriculture will likely exacerbate the adverse impacts of the landslides. This risk \ncontinues today as demand for lumber for reconstruction could further denude slopes of forests. \n33. Social Network, Employment, and Livelihoods. Community cohesion is threatened by \nforced migration. However, the interdependence of surviving members on each other and on \ncomparatively resource-rich households may restore some measure of social cohesion. \n34.  Community-based organizations and civil society networks administering to vulnerable \ngroups before the quake are not functioning as they did. The quake\u2019s impact on government ", "  7\ninfrastructure and services has crippled the ability of individuals to exercise their rights and to \nseek legal redress and protection. One of the major challenges will be to reduce the procedural \nburden and legal requirements for obtaining compensation. \n35.  The  livelihood  assets  of  affected  people  have  been  substantially  reduced.  Human \nresources and capacities are weakened; traditional and skilled labor in the informal sector does \nnot provide any form of job security. \n36.  Estimates show the total loss in employment to be around 324,000 jobs, equal to about \n29% of the employed population above the age of 10 in the affected districts. About 38% and \n25% of total employment in the affected districts of AJK and NWFP, respectively, are estimated \nto  be  lost.  The  largest  job  losses  are  in  agriculture,  small  businesses  and  shops,  and \nconstruction, while no employment loss is assumed for migrant workers and public sector \nemployees. Employment losses will likely have impact on nearly 1.6 million people. \nF.  Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority \n37.  The  ERRA  was  established  by  the  Government  on  24  October  2005  to  guide \nreconstruction work, undertake strategic planning in the affected districts, and coordinate the \nimplementation of works in the two affected provinces. It is located within the Prime Minister\u2019s \nSecretariat with a mission to expedite the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and final recovery of the \nearthquake-affected areas.  ERRA has the following functions:  \n(i)  assess damage and needs in the quake-affected areas;  \n(ii)  formulate a comprehensive program to provide for planned settlements, housing, \ngovernment buildings and offices, utilities and services, infrastructure, health and \neducation facilities, and irrigation and agriculture facilities including watershed \nprotection and environmental programs;   \n(iii)  ensure that resettlement plans are formulated for subprojects with resettlement \nimpacts prior to the award of contracts;  \n(iv)  oversee the identification of projects;  \n(v)  prescribe cost-effective technology;  \n(vi)  review and revise building codes to incorporate earthquake-resistant design in all \nrepairs and new construction;  \n(vii)  promote the development of reconstruction-related industry in the affected area;  \n(viii)  facilitate and organize direct contributions by the private sector and bilateral \ndonors for reconstructing housing, hospitals, schools, and other facilities;  \n(ix)  provide oversight and overall monitoring; and  \n(x)  facilitate disbursement of funds to the provincial agencies responsible for the \nday-to-day implementation of reconstruction. \n38.  ERRA\u2019s  Governing  Council  consists  of  the  key  senior-most  Government  officials \nresponsible for reconstruction including the Prime Minister of Pakistan (chair), the prime minister \nfor AJK, the chief minister of NWFP, minister for Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas, advisor to \nthe Prime Minister of Pakistan, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and the chairman \nof ERRA. ERRA will prepare an annual budget and maintain proper accounts, which will be \naudited by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP). \n39.  ERRA is responsible for the timely implementation of reconstruction and has been given \nauthority  to  expedite  various  central  and  provincial  government  processes,  such  as  land \nacquisition and the rapid transfer of disbursement funds, and to support provincial and district \nlevel line agencies\u2019 planning and implementation of works. ERRA is charged with ensuring that ", "8\nthe usual slow pace of implementation by the provincial agencies is stepped up to meet the 3-\nyear timeframe for restoring services and facilities.  \nG.  Response of Development Partners \n40.  The Government requested international assistance, which started arriving within days \nof the earthquake.  As of 11 November 2005, according to Government reports, assistance \ntotaling nearly $2.5 billion had been pledged by a total of 83 bilateral and multilateral donors, \nwith many also providing to the relief effort significant in-kind support, including logistical and \nmanpower assistance. Major contributions have been pledged by Australia, Canada, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Denmark, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway, Saudi \nArabia,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Turkey,  United  Arab  Emirates,  United  Kingdom,  and  United \nStates. Other donors include Algeria, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, \nRepublic of Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Oman, and Ukraine, among others. The World Bank \napproved supplemental financing of $200 million within weeks of the earthquake to help the \nGovernment  meet  emergency  expenditure  requirements.  The  United  Nations  immediately \ndeployed its Disaster Assessment and Coordination team to provide technical assistance for \nassessing the scale of the disaster and to help manage the international response. UNDP is \nhelping to coordinate relief efforts both nationally and locally. Other UN specialized agencies \nsuch as UNICEF, World Food Programme, and United Nations Population Fund have also \nprovided emergency relief assistance.\n41.  On  26  October  2005,  the  secretary-general  of  the  UN  hosted  a  ministerial-level \ninternational donors\u2019 conference in Geneva to discuss Pakistan\u2019s short-term requirements for \nrelief assistance. The UN launched a flash appeal for $550 million in immediate relief assistance \nto Pakistan. About $140 million has been earmarked for an emergency push to feed and provide \nshelter to those affected. The Geneva conference was followed by another multidonor event in \nIslamabad on 19 November 2005 aimed at boosting resources for the medium- to longer-term \nreconstruction and rehabilitation programs. The total pledged from all international donors is \nestimated at about $6.1 billion. \nH.  ADB\u2019s Response and Strategy \n42.  At the international donor\u2019s conference on earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation \nheld on 19 November 2005 in Islamabad, ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda announced that ADB \nwould provide up to $1 billion in reconstruction and recovery assistance to Pakistan during \n2005\u20132006.  \n43.  On 14 November 2005, ADB\u2019s Board approved $105 million from loan savings to the \nDecentralization  Support  Program  (DSP).  DSP  is  an  existing  program  loan  with  an \nimplementation mechanism in place, including accounting, disbursement, and fiduciary risk-\nmanagement measures. On the same day, the Board approved the establishment of Pakistan \nEarthquake Fund, including an initial contribution from ADB of $80 million in grant financing.  \n44.  The first phase of ADB\u2019s assistance to earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation, \ncomprising the $105 million for the DSP and $300 million for the proposed Project, brings total \nproposed assistance to $405 million. The second phase of the proposed assistance, targeted \nfor approval in 2006, is estimated at about $595 million. ADB also actively seeks support from \nbilateral donors as well as the private sector to use the fund as a mechanism to deliver prompt \nand effective assistance.  ", "  9\n45.  ADB\u2019s  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  is  reviewing  a  number  of  ongoing  loans  in  the \nearthquake-affected  areas  that  can  be  redesigned  to  more  effectively  address  earthquake \ndamage. In some cases, savings within these loans will be reallocated to address earthquake \nrehabilitation. \nI.  Hazard Risk Management \n46.  It is important to take into account some of the factors that may have exacerbated the \ndamage  in  affected  areas.  These  critical  factors  should  be  reflected  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of the recovery strategy, as existing vulnerabilities should be mitigated as much \nas possible rather than repeated. \n47.  Seismotectonic  considerations  indicate  that  similar  or  larger  events  in  the  same  or \nneighboring regions may be possible. A seismological observation network exists but needs \nmodernization. Efforts to undertake a new seismic risk analysis of Pakistan should also be \nintensified. Similarly, assessments of risks in the affected areas should guide reconstruction \ndecisions.  Further  multi-hazard  risk  mapping  for  the  country,  including  the  affected  areas, \nshould guide future development plans.  \n48.  A  national  disaster  management  strategy  that  enhances  existing  entities  and \nmechanisms  should  be  devised  and  implemented.  Communities,  local  authorities,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  should  be  encouraged  to  cooperate  and  be  better \nprepared.\nJ.  Lessons Learned\n49.  A review of ADB-wide experience with rehabilitation assistance indicates the following \nessential factors: (i) projects must be prepared as quickly as possible; (ii) projects should focus \non restoring facilities; (iii) to the extent possible, rehabilitation works should be completed within \n2\u20133  years;  (iv)  as  implementation  places  a  heavy  burden  on  executing  agency  staff,  and \ntherefore, strong consulting support and ADB supervision is needed during implementation; and \n(v) efforts should be made to ensure that ADB\u2019s rapid response to disasters is matched by \nequally  quick  action  by  the  government.  Lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  earlier  emergency \nprojects include the following: (i) beneficiary participation must be ensured and increased in \nproject  preparation  and  implementation,  especially  in  the  maintenance  of  facilities;  (ii) \nenvironmental and social aspects should be considered during project implementation, even \nthough the need for a rapid response may not permit a detailed treatment of these issues prior \nto the approval of the assistance; (iii) arrangements for disbursement, including retroactive \nfinancing and the use of imprest accounts,(cid:3)should give the executing agencies quick and simple \naccess to funds; (iv) project objectives and scope need to be carefully defined; and (v) criteria \nfor subproject selection should permit simple prioritization of subprojects and demand short \nimplementation periods. \n50.  Post-earthquake reconstruction is a major investment. The Government should take this \nopportunity to protect the reconstruction of public and private buildings and infrastructure from \nvarious types of hazards. Lessons learned from the damage should be fed into reconstruction \nplanning, and future risks reduced, through improved building standards and design. The safety \nof public buildings such as schools and hospitals is particularly important and should incorporate \nappropriately improved building standards to reduce their risks. Both in the reconstruction phase \nand in urban development plans, land-use plans need to integrate the identification of risk areas. \nBuildings collapsed in northern Pakistan because of very poor construction quality and the ", "10\nabsence of any seismic consideration in their design. The primary lesson learned is that new \nbuildings need to be seismically designed and built to a higher quality. Compliance with present \nregulations and more stringent codes in the future needs stronger enforcement. During the \nreconstruction phase, the repair of damaged buildings needs to include seismic strengthening. \nAdditionally, the feasibility of a national seismic retrofitting program for buildings should be \nexamined, with schools and hospitals as priorities.   \n51.  The lessons and experiences of current relief and recovery coordination should be used \nto develop an appropriate disaster-management mechanism and authority, as well as a national \nplan  that  clarifies  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  different  government  agencies  and \nstrengthens coordination among them. Risk management education and training the staff of \nappropriate  agencies  would  greatly  improve  risk  management  in  the  country.  Primary  and \nsecondary schools should also raise awareness of risks as part of the curriculum. Incorporating \nrisk-mitigation safety measures into the basic training of engineers, contractors, and builders \nshould also be considered as part of the reconstruction process. A major public awareness \ncampaign on risks, preparedness, and vulnerability reduction should be implemented as soon \nas possible. The feasibility of tailoring an insurance package to the poor that addresses their \nmain post-disaster risks should be investigated, as should investing in ex ante risk-reduction \nmeasures.\n52.  These lessons have been considered and incorporated in the design of the proposed \nProject. Indeed, ADB\u2019s response has been very rapid. Within a few days of the calamity, a team \nof ADB-funded disaster management experts started to provide assistance to the Government; \nwithin 2 weeks, a multidonor Damage and Needs Assessment Mission led by ADB and the \nWorld Bank was fielded to help the Government assess the damage and evolve a short- and \nmedium-term recovery and rehabilitation strategy. With an implementation period of 36 months, \nthe Project focuses on the immediate rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructure in the \naffected areas and the restoration of livelihoods for those affected. The proposed Project has \nbeen prepared to complement assistance from other multilateral and bilateral agencies and \ndonors.\n53.  To ensure timely implementation, the responsibility for project administration will be \ndelegated to the Pakistan Resident Mission in Islamabad, immediately upon loan effectiveness. \nIf appropriate, ADB will also consider establishing an extended mission in Muzzafarabad for the \nduration of project implementation to provide day-to-day support and guidance to the AJK line \nagencies provide on the spot review of various documents and closely monitor compliance with \nADB requirements. Pakistan Resident Mission or the possible extended mission will assist with \nquality control, speedy implementation of subprojects, and rapid assistance to ERRA, AJK, \nNWFP, the line agencies and districts on any project implementation matters. It will carry out \nrandom spot checks on procurement and project accounts of subprojects, and inspect project \nfacilities for quality control and proper financial management.  \nIII. THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n54.  The expected impact of the Project is to contribute to reversing the devastating impact of \nthe earthquake and so revive economic activity and enable people to resume their livelihoods \nand return to normal life. This will be achieved by rehabilitating and reconstructing damaged and \ndestroyed infrastructure as quickly as possible, which will particularly assist the poor and other \nvulnerable people. ", "  11\n55.  The Project will focus on the selected sectors identified through consultation with the \nGovernment, the private sector, civil society, and other donors. The Project will rehabilitate \npublic  infrastructure  and  adopt  appropriately  revised  earthquake-resistant  design  and \nconstruction  standards  in  all  construction  undertaken.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide \ncapacity  building  to  enhance  rehabilitation  capacity  and  institution  building  for  sustainable \ndevelopment. \n56.  The Project has been developed in close cooperation with other donors, all of which are \nintimately involved in post-earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction in the affected areas of \nPakistan. The choice of sectors and the project design is based on the findings of the ADB and \nWorld Bank-led PDNA. Specifically, the World Bank is likely to concentrate on housing, national \nhighways, and social sectors. Close coordination among the donors and Government has been \nmaintained throughout the processing of the Project. \n57.  Members of the project team visited affected districts and held discussions with relevant \nGovernment and relief agencies on the ground, as well as with affected people. Subsequent \ndiscussions  with  development  partners  and  the  Government  helped  project  formulation  to \nevolve based partly on comparative advantage and sectoral presence in the affected region, \nand also in regard to project scope. The project design also draws on ADB\u2019s considerable \nexperience in delivering emergency assistance in developing member countries over the past 2 \ndecades. The Project is linked with and complements relief and assistance provided by the \nGovernment, NGOs, UN, and other donors, and it takes the necessary next steps to ensure that \nassistance will be sustainable.  \n58.  In terms of its broad overall scope and objectives to support poverty reduction and \nprotect and promote livelihoods, the Project is consistent with the goals of Pakistan's Medium-\nTerm Development Framework 2005\u20132010. It is also in line with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram for Pakistan, which prioritizes improving physical and social infrastructure to support \npro-poor growth and poverty reduction throughout the country. The Project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.3\nB.  Outputs \n59.  The  Project  comprises  three  components:  (i)  quick-disbursement,  (ii)  project  sector \ncomponents, and (iii) implementation assistance. These components are designed to operate in \na mutually supportive fashion to achieve the overall objective of mitigating earthquake losses to \nthe  affected  communities  and  providing  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  priority \ninfrastructure assets.\n60. Quick-Disbursing  Component. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance Policy, a portion of the proposed Project will be used for quick-disbursing assistance \nto partly finance the unusually high and unexpected expenditures required for rehabilitation and \nreconstruction. The Project will extend a quick-disbursing component of $108 million (a $65 \nmillion grant from the Pakistan Earthquake Fund and a $35 million loan from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, and about $8 million in Government counterpart funding from taxes and \nduties).  As  per  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  the  quick-disbursing \ncomponent will be used to finance only those imports identified as necessary for an effective \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2004.  Disaster and Emergency Assistance. Operations Manual. Sections D7/BP and D7/OP.Manila.", "12\nrecovery program. The Government and ADB have agreed on a list of permissible imports for \nfinancing under the quick-disbursing project facility (Appendix 3). \n61. Project  Sector  Components.  Project  sector  components  will  be  $246.8  million, \nincluding  $185  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  and  $61.8  million  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s counterpart funding. It will be used to rehabilitate earthquake-damaged education \nand health facilities and other high-priority infrastructure by providing civil works, equipment and \nmaterials,  working  capital,  and  consulting  services  for  project  design,  implementation, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  During  the  rehabilitation  phase,  appropriate  and  cost-effective \ndesign and construction standards will be adopted. Civil works designs will follow a sector \napproach and select the highest-priority subprojects during implementation. This will allow a \nquick  response  and  maximum  flexibility  in  both  geographic  coverage  and  selection  of \ncomponents within the agreed framework and criteria. In consultation with the Government, and \ntaking into account the assistance being proposed by other development partners, the project \nsector components will finance rehabilitation and reconstruction in the following sectors: (i) \ntransport with $140.0 million; (ii) power with $53.5 million; and (iii) social sectors, including \nhealth and education, with $53.3 million. \n62. Implementation  Assistance.  Consulting services for Project implementation will be \nfinanced by $15.0 million in grants from the Pakistan Earthquake Fund. \n63.   The legal assistance, governance, and institutional building subcomponent will be $2.5 \nmillion and is included in the $15 million for implementation assistance. \nC.  Special Features  \n64.  The Project will address urgent basic needs and restore social services lost as a result \nof the earthquake. If life in the affected and neighboring areas is to return to normal, transport, \npower and social services must be restored, destroyed infrastructure must be rebuilt, and \naccess to employment opportunities must be made available. The Project has, therefore, been \nprocessed under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Since interventions will \ntypically replace preexisting assets, reconstructed to appropriate technical and earthquake-\nresistant standards, an economic analysis is not required. Investments will be made on the \nbasis of least-cost restoration of preexisting facilities. The procedures for project loan and grant \nprocessing, procurement, consultant engagement, subproject selection, and the type of works to \nbe done reflect this flexibility, without sacrificing quality, transparency, and safeguards. However, \nthe Project is designed to ensure proper targeting, subproject control and monitoring, and \ncommunity participation while addressing area resource and capacity constraints. \n65.  ADB will focus on ensuring that the Project implementation is efficient, effective, and \nexpedient. Following the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, additional resources have \nbeen dedicated to implementation, supervision and monitoring, including (i) support for ERRA, \n(ii) provision of resettlement specialists, and (iii) environment specialists to assist environmental \nassessment of earthquake-related projects by the provincial environmental protection agencies.  \n66.  The Project has been prepared through a high consultative, multidonor exercise led by \nADB  and  the  World  Bank. 4  Needs  assessment,  Project  design  and  implementation \narrangements  have  been  harmonized  among  donors,  and  aligned,  to  the  greatest  extent \n                                                \n4 The World Bank is funding reconstruction of the National Highways through additional financing to its ongoing \nHighway Rehabilitation Project. ", "  13\npossible, with the prevailing system in Pakistan in an attempt to minimize the administrative \nburden on the Government. \nD.  Sector Components \n  1.  Transport \n67.  The transport sector component of the Project will rehabilitate earthquake-damaged \nmajor roads and bridges, except national highways, within the four affected districts in AJK \n(Bagh, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, and Poonch) and the five affected districts in NWFP (Abbottabad, \nBattagram,  Kohistan,  Mansehra,  and  Shangla).  The  component  will  cover  repairing  and \nrehabilitating the damaged major roads and bridges under the Public Works Department and \nLocal  Government  and  Rural  Development  Department  in  AJK  and  the  Frontier  Highway \nAuthority  (FHA)  and  district  governments  in  NWFP.  Road  clearance  now  in  place  is  not \nanticipated  to  last  beyond  the  coming  snow  season.  More  thorough  and  permanent  road \nrebuilding measures are required, particularly protection works to minimize landslides and river \nerosion and improved drainage for slope stabilization. Rehabilitation works will restore roads \nand bridges to the pre-quake or higher standard, as this is considered cost-effective in the long \nrun. Where technically feasible and justified, rehabilitation will include protection measures to \nmitigate damage from future landslides. Land acquisition and relocation may be required where \nthe original road cannot be reconstructed and requires partial realignment. The transport sector \nassessment is in Appendix 4. \n2.  Power\n68.  The power sector faired better overall than expected immediately after the earthquake. \nThe power companies responded quickly and restored the power supply within days of the \nquake. It should be noted that nearly all repairs were of a temporary nature and need to be \nreplaced  by  permanent  solutions.  There  are  still  areas  that  have  not  yet  been  inspected \nbecause  damaged  roads  make  access  to  them  not  yet  possible.  In  the  aftermath  of  the \nearthquake, it was necessary to establish tent villages and relief camps for the dislocated \npopulation. These camps need to be electrified to ensure lighting and security at night, power \nfor  pumping  water,  and  the  efficient  operation  of  schools  and  other  common  facilities. \nTemporary electrification of tent villages and relief camps needs to be funded, and the recurring \ncosts of electricity consumption in tent villages and camps should be paid to the supplying \nelectricity distribution companies to ensure their financial sustainability.  \n69.  The  power  sector  component  comprises  rehabilitation  of  the  power  generation  and \nsupply  system  that  were  damaged  by  the  earthquake.  In  detail,  the  Project  will  cover  (i) \nrepairing the nine hydropower generation stations, including access roads, buildings, equipment \nand ancillary facilities; (ii) supplying and installing equipment and lines related to the 132 kV, 33 \nkV,  and  11  kV  substations;  (iii)  constructing  of  operational  substations  buildings  and  staff \nquarters; (iv) supplying and installing 0.4 kV and 0.22 kV low-voltage lines; (v) installing service \nconnections  to  consumers;  (vi)  providing  spare  parts,  operational  vehicles,  and  tools  (vii) \ninstalling transformers, meters, and service connections to the tent villages and relief camps \nestablished after 8 October 2005; (viii) paying electricity supply for  up to two years to the tent \nvillages and relief camps; and (ix) installing transformers, meters, and service connections to \nthe  anticipated  new  model  villages  to  be  established  for  the  victims  of  the  earthquake.  \nReconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  the  facilities  to  pre-\nearthquake levels or to a higher standard as this is considered cost-effective in the medium to \nlong term. Details of the component are in Appendix 5. ", "14\n3.  Social Sectors\n70.  The social sector component will focus on reconstruction and rehabilitation of selected \nhealth  and  education  facilities  geographically  located  in  the  affected  districts  of  AJK  and \nbenefiting  other  areas  where  affected  people  are  currently  concentrated.  The  health \nsubcomponent to be implemented by the AJK Reconstruction Agency and AJK Department of \nHealth, will include: (i) reconstructing one district hospital and three Tehsil headquarter hospitals, \nincluding wards, operating theatres, outpatient departments, staff quarters and other necessary \nservices; (ii) providing all the essential medical equipment to the hospitals including ambulances \nand supplies; and (iii) constructing proper waiting areas with public toilets and clean drinking \nwater  for  visitors.  The  education  subcomponent  to  be  implemented  by  the  Reconstruction \nAgency and AJK Department of Education will include: (i) repairing and reconstructing about \n550  partly  and  completely  destroyed  government  middle  schools  buildings  with  improved \nseismic designs, latrines and office accommodation; (ii) providing all essential furniture and \nequipment  for  all  the  middle  schools  reconstructed  and  repaired;  (iii)  training  trainers  for \nteachers training; and (iv) assessing and advising on school health services for physical and \nphysiological  health.  The  social  sectors  assessment  is  in  Appendix  6.  The  AJK  Steering \nCommittee  will  decide  whether  there  is  sufficient  capacity  within  the  line  department  to \nundertake  a  particular  subproject  or  the  implementation  is  to  be  undertaken  through  the \nspecially constituted Reconstruction Agency. \nE.  Legal Assistance, Governance, and Institutional Building\n71.  Destruction arising from the earthquake has generated legal and documentary issues for \nearthquake  affected  people,  and  enormously  strained  governmental  administration  and \nresources, at the national, provincial, and local levels. The legal assistance, governance, and \ninstitutional building subcomponent seeks to address these issues. The replacement of birth, \ndeath, marriage and disability certificates, property titles, and national identification cards will be \nsupported. Methods used for replacing documents will include supporting the collection and \ncoordination of data by the relevant departments and offices and facilitating the connectivity, \ncoordination and networking of such information; it will provide legal assistance to earthquake \naffected victims to help them address legal and documentary issues arising from the earthquake. \nThis will include the earthquake legislative framework that is currently under consideration for \nmaking special provision for persons and property affected by the earthquake. It will also \nestablish (if necessary) a decentralized mechanism for earthquake victims for private dispute \nresolution and grievance review against public officials. In addition, training and awareness \nworkshops  will  be  conducted  for  judges,  district  officials,  and  the  public  on  the  potential \nearthquake or disaster emergency related legal issues, disputes or cases that are likely to arise. \nThere will also be provision to strengthen the capacity of local government to provide for \nvocational training for women and disabled people who may need to enter the labor market for \nthe first time together with a designed program for post training assistance for finding jobs. \n72.  The legal assistance, governance, and institutional building subcomponent will support \ntransparency  of  earthquake  and  emergency  assistance,  through  ERRA  by  supporting  the \npublication in English, Pushtoo and Urdu, on the internet and in local newspapers, as well as \nbroadcast on national and provincial television and radio, of (i) modes of earthquake assistance \nfrom the Government, development partners and NGOs; (ii) contract and procurement details in \nrelation to earthquake assistance; and (iii) any proposed laws or policy relating to earthquake \nassistance. To keep the public notified, these broadcasts and publications will be regularly \nupdated at least every quarter. Assistance will also be provided to the Government to centralize \nthe collection of data on earthquake affected people and earthquake-affected property in order ", "  15\nto maximize rehabilitation efforts and minimize duplication of efforts. Details of the component \ncan be found in Appendix 7. \nF.  Cost Estimates \n73.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $374.2 million equivalent, including the \nquick-disbursing component, taxes and duties (of approximately $18.3 million) and interest \nduring  implementation.  The  Government  will  contribute  24%  of  the  estimated  cost  of \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  mainly  in  the  form  of  taxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition, \nrehabilitation, resettlement, and administrative support. As a sector approach is being followed, \nthe cost estimates are broken down by sectors (Table 2 and Appendixes 4\u20136).

Financing Plan \n74.  The Government has asked for a grant of $80 million from the Pakistan Earthquake \nFund and an additional $220 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund [ADF] loan) to help finance the Project.  \n75.  The ADF loan will have a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest \nrate of 1% per annum, and repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after \nthe grace period and 4% per annum thereafter. The Government advised that it will make the \nloan and the grant proceeds of the Project available to the governments of AJK and NWFP on \nterms and conditions in accordance with the existing policies and practices of the Government \nor any changes approved by the Government\u2018s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). \nLikewise,  a  portion  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  Peshawar \nElectricity Supply Company (PESCO) and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) NWFP \non  terms  and  conditions  in  accordance  with  the  existing  policies  and  practices  of  the \nGovernment or any changes approved by the Government\u2019s ECC. The Government will bear all \nforeign exchange risk. In addition, the Government will provide required counterpart funds for \nimplementing the Project in a timely manner to the governments of AJK and NWFP, IESCO, \nand PESCO on a grant basis.

Cofinancing \n76.  An  underlying  objective  of  ADB's  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  is  to \ncoordinate with development partners, minimize duplication, encourage cofinancing and have \ncatalytic effect on the provision of additional resources. It is likely that a number of these \npartners may be willing to complement ADB's funds for this Project through cofinancing. ADB \nhas  typically  sought  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of  loan  or  grant  funds  from \ncofinanciers  only  when  cofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  In  light  of  the  need  for \nexpediency  and  efficiency  in  ADB's  response  to  the  earthquake  disaster  and  emergency, \nManagement requests Board approval of the administration of any cofinanced funds obtained \nfrom  development  partners  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval.  Approval  of  such \ncofinanced funds will be confirmed and approved by Management, and reported to the Board in \naccordance with the standard reporting procedures. This procedure will be adopted only to the \nextent that the additional funds provided by cofinanciers will not materially alter or fundamentally \naffect the objectives, purposes and scope of the existing Project. Any proposed cofinancing that \nwill materially affect the objectives, purpose, or scope of the Project would be processed as a \nmajor  change  of  scope  and  circulated  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project \nAdministration Instructions 5.04 and the usual practice. \n77.  Simultaneously  with  loan  and  grant  negotiation,  ADB  received  indications  from  the \nEuropean Commission (EC) of its interest in providing \u20ac30 million  to finance a part of the Social \nSectors Component. The EC has indicated that its formal commitment to provide such financing \nmay be expected by the end of 2005. To avoid any Project delay, Board approval for the \nadministration of the EC grant is sought. An information paper will be provided to the Board to \ndescribe the impact of EC grant on the financing of the Project when the arrangements with the \nEC are finalized. \n78.  As described above, EC is prepared to commit to provide cofinancing with ADB, allowing \nADB to catalyze additional resources for the Project. For the EC to participate, it requires \n                                                \n5  Given the exceptional circumstances of the emergency, it is proposed that ADB fund 80% of the Project costs. ", "  17\nnondiscrimination against all its members in procurement processes. Thus, while most of the \ninvestments to be supported by the Project are expected to come from within Pakistan or to \ninvolve some procurement from ADB member countries, to facilitate the EC\u2019s commitment to \ncofinance  \u20ac30  million  for  Social  Sectors  Component,  Board  approval  is  sought  to  allow \nprocurement in, and procurement of eligible goods and services from, member countries of the \nEuropean Union, including ADB  nonmember countries. This would facilitate maximum and \nexpeditious development and catalyze additional resources from development partners in the \ncurrent emergency circumstances. \n79.  The request for Board approval is being made pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB \nCharter, which states that the Board may, by a vote of the Directors representing not less than \ntwo  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  approve  procurement  from  ADB \nnonmember countries in appropriate circumstances. The Charter provides one, non-exclusive, \nexample of what may constitute \u201cappropriate circumstances\u201d for allowing procurement in non-\nADB member countries or procurement of goods and services produced in ADB nonmember \ncountries. It states that the Charter\u2019s requirement that procurement occur only in member \ncountries may be lifted \u201cin the case of a nonmember country in which a significant amount of \nfinancing has been provided to the Bank.\u201d This example is similar to the current proposal. The \nEC is expected to provide a grant of \u20ac30 million, which is a significant contribution to the Social \nSectors Component. The European Union, which is supporting the EC\u2019s provision of such \nfinancing includes ADB members and nonmembers that are together providing this contribution \nby way of joint cofinancing for the Project. The Board\u2019s approval for lifting the procurement \nrestriction is being requested only in support of Social Sectors Component of the Project. \nI.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n80.  ERRA,  established  through  presidential  decree  in  response  to  the  8  October  2005 \nmassive earthquake, will be the executing agency for the Project, and MOF will be the executing \nagency  for  quick-disbursing  component.  The  mechanisms  and  implementation  strategies, \ninstitutional framework and related terms of reference for the recovery efforts under the umbrella \nof ERRA are still being developed. Based on the current understanding of ERRA functions, the \nauthority is expected to facilitate, guide, coordinate, approve, and monitor the reconstruction \neffort, develop the overall policy and planning framework for the reconstruction effort, standard \nsetting and quality control and manage the operation and accounting of the rehabilitation and \nreconstruction funds. ERRA is also expected to lead revisions of the current arrangements for \nsubproject approval implementation and fund flow to simplify procedures and so ensure quick \nimplementation and full transparency. As a priority, ERRA will develop and adapt appropriate \nearthquake  resistant  designs  and  construction  codes  for  immediate  adoption  by  civil \nconstruction industry. ERRA\u2019s Governing Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, will approve \noverall  programs  and  large  work  packages,  basically  fulfilling  the  role  of  the  Central \nDepartmental Working Party in normal development projects, but with a much shorter timeframe. \nERRA\u2019s Board, chaired by ERRA\u2019s Chairman, will oversee the implementation of the project \nthrough provincial and district line agencies following current/revised procedures, on fact track \nbasis. ERRA will also approve major changes in scope and cost of the subprojects, annual \nplans, and budgets. It will support Project implementing agencies with financial and technical \nmanagement. The implementing agencies include Reconstruction Agencies in NWFP and AJK, \nIESCO, and PESCO. In addition, the implementing agencies in AJK include the Departments of \nLocal Government and Rural Development, Electricity, Health, Education, and Public Works. ", "18\nThe implementing agencies in NWFP include the line department, five district governments, \nFHA, and Sarhad Hydro Development Organization (SHYDO). \n81.  ERRA  will  be  staffed  by  various  specialist  professionals  deputed  from  relevant \ngovernment departments (including those of the federal Government and other provinces), and \nhired from the private sector as necessary for ERRA to carry out its functions. Periodic social \nand technical monitoring, regular review and overall fund flow and internal audits of the Project \nwill be carried out by ERRA. The Controller General of Accounts (CGA), AGP and MOF will \nprescribe the related procedures and requirements for fiduciary monitoring. The AJK and NWFP \nimplementing agencies will develop the subprojects following the selection criteria and social \ncompliance, through public consultation, based on procedures outlined in Appendix 10 and to \nbe formalized in an operational manual to be prepared by ERRA.  \n82.  The  governments  of  AJK  and  NWFP,  through  their  steering  committees  specially \nconstituted  for  the  purpose  of  reconstruction  in  the  quake  affected  areas,  chaired  by  the \nAdditional Chief Secretaries of AJK and NWFP and having representation of ERRA, provincial \nline  departments  and  the  district  governments  (in  case  of  NWFP),  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing the provincial planning and implementation of subcomponents. These committees \nwill  be  supported  by  professionally  staffed  Reconstruction  Agencies  (RA)\u2014the  NWFP \nReconstruction Agency and the AJK Reconstruction Agency, containing various specialist staff, \nwill be responsible for implementation of subprojects for which capacity does not exist at with \nprovincial  and  district  line  departments  contracted  as  decided  by  the  respective  steering \ncommittees of NWFP and AJK.  RAs will design and approve subprojects falling within the \npowers delegated to the RA by the provincial Government and within the overall annual budget \nand work plan approved by ERRA. The steering committees and ERRA will approve work plans, \nbudgets and provide overall guidance, in line with emergency procedures to be put in-place by \nERRA  Council  and/or  Board.  For  the  subprojects  implemented  through  the  provincial  line \ndepartments/implementing agencies, and the district governments, where technical capacity \nexists as decided by the respective SCs, additional support will be provided by deputing staff \nand by appointment of additional expertise as required to meet the additional work load and fast \ntrack  requirements,  due  diligence  and  reporting.  ERRA,  RAs  and  line  departments  staff \nrequirements, and related operating costs, will be funded through incremental administration \nsupport, supported in part by ADB grant funds.  \n83.  The  district  advisory  committees  (DACs)/district  development  committees  (DDCs) \nheaded by district coordination officer (DCO) or Nazims in NWFP and deputy commissioners in \nAJK, will be responsible for identification of subprojects and needs, and recommend plans for \napproval of the steering committees. These plans will be approved annually by the steering \ncommittees or ERRA and implemented through RA (through their district reconstruction units), \nline  departments  and  district  governments,  as  recommended  by  steering  committees. \nImplementing  agencies\u2019  additional  incremental  staff  and  overhead  cost  for  subproject \nimplementation, and technical backstopping and technical assistance support for implementing \nagencies to plan, design, supervise and implement the subprojects, will be financed by the \nprojects.\n84.  Identification  of  subprojects  will  be  done  by  respective  implementing  agencies  in \nconsultation with the local stakeholder, using official records and applications received from \ncommunities, NGOs and elected representatives, to identify schemes and the sites. Selection of \nsites and subprojects will be made from the identified list using a pre-determined selection \ncriteria. The selected list will be verified and appraised for social compliance (through public \nconsultation) by NGOs/specialized agency directly hired by ERRA for the 8 affected districts in ", "  19\nAJK and NWFP. The RAs of NWFP and AJK, with the assistance of hired consultant teams, will \nundertake  the  technical  and  safeguard  appraisal,  before  the  list  is  submitted  DAC \nrecommendation/advice  and  approval  of  the  SCs  and  ERRA.  ERRA  Council,  SCs  and \nimplementing  agencies  will  approve  the  subprojects  to  be  executed  by  district/provincial \nagencies, within their approval limits and after screening send the list of subprojects to be \nimplemented by federal line agency for their approval. \n85.  In addition to the incremental staff support and/or consultants hired by the RAs and line \ndepartments of AJK and NWFP, to implement the project components, ERRA will use their own \nstaff and/or hire short term consultants to assist them with due diligence and monitoring and to \nguide implementing agencies in project appraisal, coordination and incorporation of social and \nenvironmental safeguards. Consulting firms recruited directly by RA and line departments will \nassist  the RA,  provincial  line  agencies  and district  government  (depending  on  the  agency \nimplementing  the  subprojects)  with  design,  processing  approvals,  and  internal  monitoring, \nprocurement, and construction supervision.  \n86. Financial  Management.  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  manage  the  multidonor \nConsolidated Fund for Emergency Earthquake Assistance established in the State Bank of \nPakistan (SBP) through which the project funds will flow. ERRA is putting in place the related \nfiduciary arrangements to ensure transparency in the flow of funds, financial management, \naccounting, internal control processes, procurement, periodic financial reporting, monitoring and \ninternal  and  external  audits.  The  CGA  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  accounting  and \nreporting  practices  and  requirements.  The  CGA,  MOF  and  AGP  will  provide  the  related \nguidelines,  and  ensure  that  all  relevant  government  statutory  provisions  and  prudential \nregulations are followed. Disbursement of project funds will generally follow existing accounting \nprocedures. The AGP will have the overall responsibility for the audit of earthquake assistance, \nand as such will be responsible for determining the appropriate auditing arrangements and for \nensuring the timely completion of audits and that audits will be conducted in accordance with \ninternationally accepted auditing practices.    \n87.  The Project funds will be disbursed through the Consolidated Fund in SBP to the imprest \naccount operated by the fund manager\u2014the MOF for the quick-disbursing components and \nERRA for the other components\u2014to finance loan and grant components of the Project. MOF will \nmake budget allocation for counterpart funds in the Budget, and release the Government\u2019s \ncounterpart share as a grant in a separate account operated by the fund manager in the form of \nbudget allocation, as a grant, released from the MOF to ERRA Fund (a special deposit fund in \nPublic  Account\u2014assignment  account).  The  ADB  funds  for  the  Project,  and  Government\u2019s \ncounterpart funds will be released to ERRA as executing agency (excluding quick-disbursing \ncomponent, for which MOF will be the EA). ERRA will maintain separate accounts for ADB loan \nand grants (imprested accounts), Government\u2019s counterpart funds and will release funds to the \nrespective implementing agencies (second generation imprest accounts) as advances against \napproved budget/work plan at the federal, provincial and district levels,. All funds will be utilized \nfor their intended purposes as per the financing plan, in accordance with the procedures set \ndown by CGA and ERRA. ADB funds will be issued with specified codes for the rehabilitation \nand reconstruction program, and all payments and disbursements will be made based on these \ncodes. The fund flow arrangement is in Appendix 9. \n88. ERRA will provide ADB with quarterly financial and physical progress reports on the use \nof ADB and other donor funds, as well as annually audited financial statements. Given the \nmagnitude of funds that will pass through ERRA for implementation, MOF had proposed that \nERRA should establish periodic internal audits and reviews mechanisms, in consultation with ", "20\nother donors and ADB. These will provide systemic feedback to improve financial management, \nfund-flow timeliness, accountability and transparency. Project imprest accounts will be operated \nin accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). The AGP may \nnominate private chartered accountants, if required, to meet the increased burden on and to \ndemonstrate transparency.\n89.  All  donor  funds  channeled  through  ERRA  will  be  subject  to  the  same  operating \nprocedures and processes. The World Bank has completed a preliminary financial management \nassessment,  which  is  available  as  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Based  on  the  preliminary \nassessment,  and  subject  to  finalization  of  implementation  and  financial  management \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, financial management arrangements for the Project are \nfound to be satisfactory. \n90. Monitoring  and Anticorruption  Measures.  ADB and other donors will rely on the \nagreed funds-flow mechanism, as well as the periodic disbursement, procurement, and output \nmonitoring  reports  generated  by  ERRA,  to  fulfill  their  assurance  requirements.  A  generic \nperformance  monitoring  system  will  be  established  by  ERRA  in  consultation  with  donor \nagencies, including ADB. This system will take into account the key indicators and targets \noutlined in the project framework. With the assistance of project-financed consultants, ERRA will \nfacilitate the development of this framework and its implementation plan within 3 months of loan \neffectiveness. Basic damage assessment has already been conducted and information provided \nin this assessment will be updated within 3 months of loan effectiveness to validate the damage \nbaseline. ERRA and provincial RAs and line departments will use this baseline to undertake \nregular  reviews  and  provide  routine  monitoring  reports,  for  which  the  requirements  and \nstructures will be agreed with al the donors by ERRA and provided in the operations manual. \nMonitoring bodies are envisaged at both the provincial level (including the AJK) and the district \nlevel. These will consist of technical, environmental and social safeguard specialist; elected \nrepresentatives and NGOs, who will produce regular monitoring reports and undertake periodic \nreviews of project implementation.  \n91.  Apart  from  the  regular  monitoring  framework  and  reporting  requirement  established \nunder ERRA operations, the Project will be reviewed jointly by ERRA and ADB, with frequencies \nand timeframes agreed by ADB and ERRA. The terms of reference of external donor review will \nalso be negotiated and agreed between donors, including ADB, and ERRA for the purpose of \nconsistency, effectiveness, and efficiency, and also to avoid overloading the agencies involved \nin the reconstruction activity. A comprehensive midterm review planned after the first year of the \nProject will: (i) evaluate the project\u2019s scope, design, and implementation arrangements; (ii) \nassess the effectiveness of implementing agencies, and structure in terms of achieving project \nobjectives  and  targets;  (iii)  evaluate  the  progress  on  contract  awards  disbursement  and \nprocurement,  and  appropriateness  of  the  related  procedures  for  these  aspects  to  achieve \nproject targets; (iv) evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the monitoring, safeguard and \nfund  flow  arrangement;  (v)  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  consultants  and  consultancy \narrangement in delivering project outputs and technical assistance terms of reference; (vi) \nidentify changes needed in any or all of the arrangement and components; (vii) identify critical \nissues and constraints, if any; and (viii) recommend adjustments to the project design and/or \nimplementation arrangements, if necessary. The midterm review will identify any slow-moving \ncomponent and make recommendations for remedial measures.  Reallocation of funds from \npoorly performing components to better performing components may be recommended by the \nMidterm Review Mission.  ", "  21\n92.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand executing agencies. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support \nthese efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan and \nGrant  Regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agencies  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n93.  In addition, ERRA will publicly disclose on the website for the Project information on how \nthe funds are being used for the intended beneficiaries following applicable procedures. The \nwebsite will present financial statements and track procurement contract awards, as well as \ninclude information on, among other things, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning \nbidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, the list of \ngoods and/or services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.  \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n94.  The implementing agencies will formulate and propose a list of subprojects through the \nSC  and  line  departments.  The  implementing  agencies  will  conduct  initial  screening  of  the \nproposals and submit these to the provincial steering body for final selection and approval in \naccordance with general selection criteria for purposes of eligibility criteria for each project \ncomponent. The general eligibility criteria are listed in Appendix 10.\n95.  The first two subprojects to be carried out by each implementing agency will be subject \nto  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB  before  commencement.  Any  subsequent  subproject \nexceeding $500,000 equivalent but less than $3 million equivalent will be sent to the relevant \nsteering committee for approval and ADB for information, while subprojects exceeding $3 million \nequivalent  will  require  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB.  Subprojects  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000 equivalent or less will be subject to approval by the respective PDWP and random \naudit and checks by ADB to ensure compliance with requirements of subproject selection \ncriteria and the implementation arrangement. \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n96.  As the Project is for emergency assistance, implementation will start immediately after \napproval  and  be  completed  within  36  months.6 A  detailed  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 11.\n4.  Procurement \n97.  Given the urgent Project needs, procurement of goods, works, and services will be \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under \nthe ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand the contemplated implementation schedule. ADB procedures for providing reconstruction \n                                                \n6  The period of 36 months for project implementation was requested by the Government, and is considered justified \nbased on the extreme destruction and dislocation caused by the earthquake of 8 October 2005, and the weakened \nabsorptive capacity of the country, particularly the provincial and district administrations of the affected areas, \nfollowing  the  disaster.  The  36-month  implementation  schedule  under  the  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency \nAssistance Policy is considered appropriate.", "22\nassistance after disasters allow maximum flexibility so that project activities can start promptly. \nLocal competitive bidding procedures will be the preferred mode of procurement.  \n98.  Goods and related services estimated at more than $1 million will be procured following \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. International shopping procedures will be followed \nfor procurement of goods and related services estimated at between $100,000 and $1 million. \nFor small, specialized equipment and materials contracts valued less than $100,000, direct \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed. Due to the urgent nature of this \nProject, the bidding period for international competitive bidding will be shortened to 30 days and \nfor local competitive bidding, to 14 days. \n99.   Civil works contracts over $5 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding and those estimated to cost $5 million or less will be procured through local competitive \nbidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Post-qualification  with  single  stage:  two-envelope \nprocedures, and usage of the existing contractor registration system or contractors previously \nprequalified for works of similar size and nature is acceptable. Further, in order to effectively \nrespond  to  the  urgent  Project  needs,  contracts  estimated  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be \nawarded to local contractors or those contractors who are working in the affected region on \ndirect  contracting  basis  at  negotiated  rates  or  at  rates  of  ongoing  contracts.  Civil  works \nestimated between $100,000 to $500,000 may be awarded following limited local competitive \nbidding  procedures  by  inviting  a  limited  number  of  registered  or  qualified  contractors  to \nparticipate in the bidding, including where practicable, the invitation for bids will be advertised in \na national newspaper. ADB will conduct prior review of bidding documents, technical and price \nevaluation reports and award recommendations for all packages estimated to cost $1,000,000 \nand above. For contracts estimated to cost less than $1,000,000, ADB will review and approve \nthe first contracts for each implementing agency/PIU; post-facto approval procedures will follow \nif procurement procedures are satisfactory. However, if ADB determines at a later stage that its \nguidelines were not followed, ADB may not accept the award, or terms, of the contract in which \ncase the Government cannot use loan or grant proceeds to finance the contract. If the loan or \ngrant  proceeds  have  already  been  used  to  finance  such  contracts  at  the  time  of  such \ndetermination, the Government will refund to ADB any such expenditure incurred. Rebidding \nand extending bid validity will be subject to ADB prior approval. Community participation in the \nprocurement of small works of a simple nature is encouraged.7\n100.  For  the  quick-disbursing  component,  all  items  on  the  positive  list  imported  by  the \nGovernment, including packages procured by private entities on behalf of the Government \nfollowing normal local commercial procedures for the private sector and standard Government \nprocurement  procedures  for  the  public  sector  procurement,  where  such  procedures  are \nfunctioning and appropriate and acceptable to ADB, are eligible.  \n5.  Consulting Services \n101.  The implementation of the earthquake reconstruction program will more than double the \nnormal level of development activities in NWFP and AJK, putting unprecedented stress on the \nresponsible agencies. The most efficient way to boost their human and skills capacity is to \nrecruit experienced consultants. Implementation support will take three forms: (i) legal advisory, \ngovernance, and institutional building ($2.5 million); (ii) incremental administrative support ($5 \n                                                \n7 To encourage community participation and use of indigenous materials, methods to incorporate community \nparticipation in procurement may be used for rural and municipal infrastructure. Small works contract with an \nestimated cost of $20,000 or less in each case may be awarded to community organizations in accordance with \npractices and procedures acceptable to ADB. ", "  23\nmillion); and (iii) consulting services ($7.5 million). All implementation support will be funded \nfrom ADB grant proceeds. \n102.  The decision on consultancy packaging and whether to recruit the specialist consultants \nindividually or through a firm will be determined during the inception phase. The incremental \nadministrative support will include the cost of staff to strengthen the capacity of ERRA and the \nimplementing agencies and the PIUs. These staff would be a mixture of deputed government \npersonnel  and  individual  specialist  from  institutes,  private  sector  or  consulting  firms.  It  is \nestimated  that  ERRA  would  require  about  30  such  new  staff,  including  three  international \nadvisors (earthquake seismic/structural, construction manager/planner and safeguard specialist) \nin the first year. The estimated budget is $2.5 million for first year, but decreasing as the initial \ncapacity building is attained. Since ERRA is responsible for overseeing implementation by all \nagencies, not just ADB, it is proposed that ADB will finance about a third of the total cost or $1.7 \nmillion, over the 3-year period.\n103.  Similarly, the implementing agencies will need an estimated five specialists, including \none international construction/procurement specialist, for the first 12 months. As with ERRA, the \nimplementing  agencies  will  support  implementation  of  all  externally  financed  projects.  The \nestimated cost is $0.4 million per year for 3 years or $1.2 million total, for each province. \nProvincial  and  district  line  and  implementing  agencies  will  also  need  capacity  building  in \nconstruction and safeguard aspects and support for implementation. It estimated that each \nimplementing agency will require at least four domestic specialists in project planning and \ndesign,  procurement,  construction  management  and  quality  control  and  safeguards.  The \nestimated cost of the incremental administration for these implementing agencies is $150,000 \nper year per implementing agency, or $2.1 million in each of NWFP and AJK over the 3 years.  \n104.  In addition, to the incremental administrative support for the Reconstruction Agencies in \nAJK and NWFP, design and construction supervision consultants are required. The consulting \nservices will consist of about 1,500 person-months.  \n105.  All  consulting  firms,  and  individual  international  consultants,  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. Since the rehabilitation and reconstruction work to be financed under the \nProject must be completed within 36 months due to the nature of the Project, expeditious \nselection and fielding of consultants is necessary. Accordingly, qualified and existing consulting \nservices  on  the  ground  should  be  extended  and  retrofitted  to  address  emergency  needs, \nprovided that these consultants meet the following conditions: (i) appropriate expertise for the \nproposed assignment, (ii) capacity for immediate mobilization, and (iii) satisfactory performance \nin previous projects.8 This arrangement will provide an efficient way to recruit consultants under \nthe circumstances. Consulting services from firms will also be provided through quality- and \ncost-based selection using simplified technical proposals. Individual consultants will be procured \nthrough ADB\u2019s procedures for recruitment of in individual consultants. Since the Project is to be \ncompleted in only 36 months, selection and fielding of consultants must be expeditious. Outline \nterms of reference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n                                                \n8    This is in conformity with para. 114 of ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Policy, which states: \u201cDirect selection, \nnegotiation, and hiring are desirable  when justified to expedite technical services required in emergency \nsituations. Time-consuming competitive bidding processes should be avoided wherever possible. Qualified and \nexisting consulting services on the ground should be extended and retrofitted to address emergency needs, as in \nthe recent Gujarat earthquake project\u201d. ", "24\n6.  Advance Action \n106.  Given the urgency of the Project, advance action before the date of loan and grant \neffectiveness was endorsed including ADB\u2019s approval of the recommendations for awarding \ncontracts for procuring goods, services, and civil works and the recruitment of consultants. The \nGovernment has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of such advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n107.  Implementation and Project Sector Components. Disbursements will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001) as amended from time to \ntime and detailed arrangements agreed between ADB and the Government. Each executing \nagency and implementing agency, through qualified accounting staff, will prepare disbursement \nprojections, request budgetary allocations for counterpart funds, maintain books of accounts \nand  supporting  documents  and  prepare  withdrawal  applications.  On  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness,  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  as  necessary  at  the  National  Bank  of \nPakistan for ERRA and the MOF for the loan and the grant to cover eligible expenditures under \nthe Project. Existing government fund flow arrangements will be used to disburse funds from the \nexecuting agencies\u2019 imprest account down to the district levels.  \n108.  The advance to each imprest account will not exceed the lesser of 3 months\u2019 estimated \nproject expenditures or 10% of the loan and grant amount. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure \nprocedures  will  be  followed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  accounts  and  to  reimburse  individual \npayments of up to $100,000. The imprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished \nand liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001) as \namended from time to time, and with detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB.  \n109.  ERRA will disburse funds directly for the activities including (i) capital and operating \ncosts of the ERRA; (ii) consultants, technical support team offices, capacity building and training \nactivities; and (iii) related expenditures for monitoring, review, and evaluations. \n110. Quick-Disbursing  Component.  The  quick-disbursing  component  will  be  disbursed \nbased on a list of imports identified as necessary for an effective recovery program. The \nproceeds will be disbursed based on certification by the Government that, with regard to imports \nnot  earlier  than  8  October  2005,  the  value  of  the  total  imports,    less  imports  from  ADB \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and disbursements made by other donors, is greater \nthan the amounts claimed for disbursements.  \n111.  The Government will be required to submit with each withdrawal request certification \nconfirming  compliance  with  the  above  formula  in  respect  of  the  period  covered  by  the \nwithdrawal request. Disbursements will be in the form of reimbursement to the Government. \nSupporting documentation for this component will be limited to customs clearance documents \nand records of the Department of Customs. For purposes of disbursement, submission of these \ndocuments will not be required. However, these documents will be audited during the annual \naudit and a separate audit opinion shall be provided on the use of loan and grant proceeds \nunder the quick-disbursing component. ", "  25\n8.  Retroactive Financing \n112.  The Project provides for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures. ADB has agreed \nto provide retroactive financing of up to 30% of Project for eligible expenditures incurred not \nearlier than 8 October 2005, provided that the expenditures are procured in accordance with \nagreed procedures. The Government has been advised that provision of retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n113.  The Government has requested, and ADB has agreed, subject to Board approval, to \nfinance on a retroactive basis, the (i) cost of consulting services related to surveys with respect \nto  damage  and  needs  assessment  provided  that  the  consultants  have  been  engaged  in \naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB; and (ii) cost of procurement activities related to \nthe Power Sector Component provided that such activities have been carried out in accordance \nwith procedures acceptable to ADB.  ADB shall have the right to refuse to finance any contract \nthat has been entered into and does not meet ADB\u2019s requirements. \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n114.  Each executing and implementing agency will maintain records and accounts adequate \nto identify works, goods, and services financed by the loan and grant proceeds. Specifically, \neach executing agency and implementing agency will (i)  maintain separate accounts for the \nProject;  (ii)  ensure  that  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited  annually  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB; and \n(iii) provide to ERRA for consolidation and delivery to ADB, not later than 4 months after the \nclose of each fiscal year with certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements and \nthe report of the auditor on these, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of the imprest \naccounts,  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  and  certification  of  imports  (for  the  quick-\ndisbursing component). Given the relatively high degree of fiduciary risk associated with this \nProject, the audited accounts and financial statements will be provided to ADB within 4 months \nof the end of the fiscal year.9\n115.  Consistent with the harmonization and alignment agenda, ADB, the World Bank and \nother major donors are attempting to harmonize their requirements and alight to the greatest \nextent  possible,  align  them  with  Pakistan's  own  systems  and  procedures  to  reduce  the \nadministrative burden on the Government. Harmonized accounting and reporting requirements \nshould  improve  both  the  accuracy  and  timeliness  of  financial  reporting.  ADB  will  hold  the \nGovernment of Pakistan accountable that funds will be used in an efficient and effective manner \nand for their intended purpose. ADB will rely on CGA to ensure that adequate accounting \nprocedures and practices (including internal controls) satisfactory to ADB are developed and \nimplemented, and on AGP to ensure that audits are conducted in line with internationally \nacceptable auditing practices. ADB will reserve the right to substitute auditors and/or to conduct \nits own audit should irregularities comes to light.10\n                                                \n9\nThe auditing requirement has been harmonized with that of the World Bank. Although both institutions typically \nrequire submission of audited financial statements within 6 months, it was felt that the risks associated with this \ntransaction, together with a 36-month implementation period warranted a slightly tighter deadline for submission. \n10    The World Bank has supported the Project to Improve Financial Reporting and Accounting (PIFRA) in Pakistan. \nUnder this project, the audit component has succeeded in upgrading the audit methodology, depth of compliance \ntesting, regularity of audit practices, performance audit, audit reporting and audit report follow-up. A significant \nnumber of auditors has been trained in the use of modern auditing techniques. While audit quality has improved \nmarkedly with the increased professionalism of auditors, the timeliness of completion of the audit has not \nimproved significantly. This has been due primarily to devolution and the need to provide separate audit services ", "26\n116.  Each executing agency/implementing agency will prepare quarterly progress reports in a \nformat  acceptable  to  ADB,  which  will  provide  information  on  (i)  progress  made  against \nestablished  targets,  including  pre-identified  monitoring  indicators;  (ii)  delays  and  problems \nencountered, and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) a \nproposed program of activities for the next quarter. ERRA will consolidate the reports of all \nimplementing agencies and deliver them to ADB. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, each implementing agency will prepare a project completion report and submit it to \nERRA for delivery to ADB. \n10.  Environmental Assessments and Monitoring\n117.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  as  the  primary  focus  is  on  rehabilitation  of  existing  social \ninfrastructure. The Project has been designed and will be flexibly implemented following a \nsector loan modality. Unlike a sector project, the proposed Project has no sample subproject \nselected at present, due to its emergency nature, and, therefore, no sample subproject initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE). The Project\u2019s IEE provides overall preliminary scoping and \nhighlights  potential  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  to  be  further  explored \nduring subproject formulation. The Project\u2019s IEE includes also the environmental assessment \nand review framework (EARF), which provides a set of guidelines on how the environmental \nassessment  for  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  reviewed.  The  summary  of  project  IEE \nincluding the EARF is attached in Appendix 14. \n11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n118.  A performance monitoring system, satisfactory to ADB will be established, based on the \nkey indicators and targets outlined in the project framework. With the assistance of project \nfinanced consultants, ERRA will develop comprehensive project performance monitoring system \n(PPMS)  procedures  and  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Monitoring \nSystem Handbook within 9 months of loan effectiveness. The PPMS procedures, performance \nindicators, and their targets will be reviewed and approved by ADB. Benchmark surveys will be \nconducted  before  project  implementation.  With  the  help  of  its  consultant,  ERRA  will  then \nundertake every 6 months quantitative and qualitative project-performance monitoring for each \nproject component to evaluate the delivery of planned facilities and the project benefits that \naccrued. The RAs and other implementing agencies will assist ERRA in collecting baseline data \nand carrying out PPMS activities. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n119.  Given the relatively high degree of fiduciary risk associated with this Project, and the \nextraordinary challenges over the Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) and the office \nof the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), which are created by this Project as well as by \nother donor Projects, ADB will ensure that these agencies will be provided with adequate \nresources to meet their fiduciary responsibilities. A TA for $2 million to be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program,  titled Capacity  Building  for  the  Office  of  the  Auditor \nGeneral of Pakistan,  will assist AGP and CGA to support ERRA to ensure that (i) all executing \n                                                                                                                               \nto the district governments. Now that the district audit infrastructure is in place, AGP is better placed to complete \naudits in a timely fashion. Through PIFRA, the Government is adopting international best practice in auditing, \nand AGP is moving further into areas such as performance and risk-based auditing. ", "  27\nand  implementing  agencies  receiving  earthquake  funds  maintain  auditable  accounts;  (ii) \nfinancial, compliance and performance audits are conducted by the newly established Director \nGeneral Audit ERRA wing of the AGP in accordance with International Organization of Supreme \nAudit Institutions standards; and (iii) ERRA performance monitoring and evaluation systems are \ncoherent and provide information to enable timely preparation of reports for management and \ndonors and ensure that implementation lessons inform policy makers. \n120.  The  TA  includes  provision  of  192  person-months  domestic  and  9  person-months \ninternational  consultants.  Consultants  will  provide  training  and  technical  advice  in  various \naspects of audit, accounts and performance monitoring and evaluation. The terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 18. The AGP and CGA will be the executing agencies for the TA. \nThe proposed TA is scheduled to be implemented for 36 months from January 2006 to January \n2009.  Administration of the proposed TA will be delegated to ADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission. \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Poverty Impacts \n121.  The  Project  will contribute  to  the Government\u2019s  efforts  to  regenerate  the  economy, \nrehabilitate public infrastructure and utilities, and generate employment. It will help restore \naccess to public infrastructure and services. The priority given to providing unskilled work to \naffected people, including women, will be an important intervention for people who cannot \nreestablish their livelihoods and are living in temporary shelters. \n122.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  and  lost  infrastructure,  particularly  roads  and  power \nsystems, will improve the quality of life, revive industry and agriculture, and facilitate affected \nhouseholds\u2019 reconnection to the rest of the country. Support for physical reconstruction in key \nsectors like education and healthcare will have positive effects on enhancing human capital and \nprotecting the vulnerable.  \n123.  In addition, rehabilitation works that entail clearing debris with labor on a cash-for-work \nbasis, and rebuilding basic infrastructure using appropriate labor-intensive methods, can create \nboth temporary and permanent jobs for the poor. The benefits of the Project will be evident \nthrough economic rehabilitation arising from the speedy reconstruction of infrastructure and \nfacilities and livelihood restoration in the earthquake-affected areas. \n124.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. \nB.  Social Impacts \n125.  The earthquake has been as much a socioeconomic disaster for individual households \nas  a  disaster  affecting  physical  infrastructure.  About  2.8  million  people,  out  of  the  total \npopulation of 5 million in the affected areas, were left homeless. Many have lost all their basic \nnecessities for survival, including clothing and household essentials. Since damage is unusually \nbad in certain villages and towns, the percentage of households affected locally will be markedly \nhigher, implying that a higher percentage of people have entered the ranks of the poor. The \n\u201cnew poor\u201d will also come from the most vulnerable and marginalized groups, both socially and \neconomically.  Considering  the  extent  of  the  damage,  the  cost  of  rebuilding  houses  and \ninfrastructure is exorbitant both for affected households and for the state. Support in terms of \nfinancial assistance and the introduction of improved earthquake-resistant technology will be of \nconsiderable benefit in protecting both the old poor and the new from sinking further into poverty. ", "28\n126.  The legal assistance, governance, and instititutional building subcomponent will also \noffer  a  great  opportunity  to  tackle  some  major  social  issues,  such  as  gender  and  other \nvulnerabilities, legal discrimination and cultural marginalization. Legal constraints may be lifted \nto face the emergency and set ground for further changes. Creating an environment that is \nconducivefor vulnerable and marginalized groups in the earthquake-affected areas to participate \nfully in reconstruction activities is an urgent need. Orphans, wives of the missing, single heads \nof households, and widowers have to deal with transformations in their social roles that place \nnew burdens on them. Helping them to become economically independent and to improve the \nwell-being of their families involves reducing existing inequalities and discrimination. To this \nend, a gender action plan is presented in Appendix 16. \nC.  Resettlement Issues \n127.  As reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads, power, health, and education infrastructure \nwill be done mostly at their original locations, no major resettlement impacts11 are envisaged \nunder  the  Project.  The  need  for  involuntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  in  a  specific \nsubproject area will be known only during project implementation, when site-specific plans are \navailable for subprojects. However, improvement of existing facilities or new construction could \nrequire land acquisition and relocation. Moreover, relocation of households and communities \nmay take place where severely affected locations are specifically declared by authorities as too \nhigh-risk to allow rehabilitation. A measure of voluntary resettlement may also be expected in \nplaces affected by major landslides, or where affected people have been either squatters or \nrenters. In some affected districts of NWFP, a few big landlords employ large numbers of \ntenants to cultivate their land on long-term leases. Such land tenure arrangements will need \ncareful examination to develop fair compensation and relocation entitlements. In addition, the \npermanent  or  temporary  removal  of  squatters  from  road  rights-of-way  could  generate \nresettlement impacts on them. Another issue is how to re-establish the property rights of those \nwho were temporarily displaced by the earthquake, as most of them enjoyed only user rights \nover the land on which they earned their living as cultivators and shepherds. The death of \nhousehold heads could similarly generate difficulties for their surviving household members in \nre-establishing  ownership  over  destroyed  or  damaged  household  property.  The  principal \nentitlements of those who will be affected by subprojects are listed in the entitlement matrix of \nthe resettlement framework (Appendix 15). A subproject involving resettlement impacts will be \napproved by ADB only after the executing and/or implementing agency submits a satisfactory \nresettlement plan for the subproject, prepared in accordance with the agreed resettlement \nframework.\nD.  Indigenous Peoples Issues \n128.  In  NWFP,  some  of  the  earthquake-affected  communities  are  tribal.  Tribes  typically \ndominate the areas they occupy and participate in the mainstream economic and political \nactivities. Tribal people are well represented in mainstream public institutions, the civil service, \nand educational institutions. The social inequality and vulnerability of most such people thus \narise from economic differentiation rather than from social exclusion or cultural differences. In \nthe earthquake-affected areas, for example, land is owned by a few large, powerful tribal \nfamilies. They rent out their land to members of the same tribe or sub-tribe to cultivate crops \n                                                \n11    Resettlement impacts are \u201csocial and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are (i) caused by \nacquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on land as \na result of an ADB operation\u201d (F2 OM/BP).  ", "  29\nand to raise livestock. All of them will certainly benefit from the rehabilitation of roads, power \nsystems, and social services such as education and health facilities that were destroyed or \ndamaged by the earthquake.  \n129.  A social assessment12 will be conducted focusing on the potential vulnerability of all \naffected groups, including tribal people, to ensure effective consultations and that culturally \nappropriate benefits reach each such affected group, instead of focusing only on groups defined \nas indigenous peoples. As part of this assessment, the executing and implementing agencies of \neach subproject will examine the vulnerabilities of all groups in terms of potential exclusion from \nproject benefits, negative project impacts, if any, and the need for specific culturally compatible \nmechanisms for participation (e.g., for women and the permanently disabled). If such exclusions \nare found in the subproject area, the executing and implementing agencies will incorporate \nadequate measures in subproject design to address such vulnerabilities. If land acquisition or \nrelocation becomes necessary, people\u2019s entitlements will be ensured by the subproject through \nits resettlement plan, which will be prepared in accordance with the approved resettlement \nframework. This is the most appropriate and efficient approach to rebuild and reconstruct  \nE.  Environmental Impacts   \n130.  The Project\u2019s IEE indicates that the Project is not expected to have significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts. What adverse environmental impacts the Project will likely have will be \nlimited mostly to the construction stage. These impacts will be reversible, short term, affecting \nonly  a  limited  area,  and  therefore  manageable.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  that \nsubprojects subject to the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements \nwill  carry  them  out  prior  to  their  approval.  It  is  also  necessary  that  the  environmental \nmanagement plan for each subproject be strictly implemented. \nF.  Sustainability \n131.  A key selection criteria for subprojects to be financed through the Project will be an \nassessment  of  financial  sustainability.  This  will  include  an  assessment  of  availability  of \ncounterpart financing for implementation purposes as well as for future incremental recurrent \ncosts. Based on these arrangements and given the current macroeconomic environment, the \nProject is felt to be financially sustainable. \nG.  Risks, Mitigation Measures, and Assumptions \n132.  Major risks associated with this emergency project include \n(i)  physical risks due to aftershocks causing further damage to already weakened \nstructures and infrastructure and land slides could cause delays in restoration of \nservices and reconstruction. The upcoming snow fall will lead to snow melt and \nrunoff in spring and summer seasons which could trigger further land slides and \nerosion, potentially damaging reconstructed infrastructure; \n(ii)  the  remote  locations  and  difficult  topography  makes  any  reconstruction  \nlogistically difficult and will lead to longer time frames; \n                                                \n12   The World Bank has planned to conduct a similar social assessment in the affected areas prior to formulating \nplans for subprojects. During implementation, however, attention will be given to bakarwals, or nomadic tribes \nthat periodically migrate into the affected areas. ", "30\n(iii)  the high elevations in some of the areas means that there is heavy snow cover \nand low temperatures during winter months, which means that reconstruction \nmust take place mostly during summer months, leading to longer than normal \nelapsed time to complete  works; \n(iv)  massive  relief  operations  and  temporary  housing  camps  could  hinder/delay \nreconstruction, especially in the vicinity of the larger towns, in order to relocate \npeople to make room for reconstruction work; \n(v)  lack of available land for new rights of way, could delay access  by contractors to \nwork sites; \n(vi)  lack of human capacity of NWFP and especially AJK local governments due to \nloss of much of their own buildings and facilities, and many staff, and lack of \nexperience  with  externally  funded  projects,  especially  the  due  diligence \nrequirements;\n(vii)  weakened capacity of local consultants and contractors and more specifically the \noverstretching  of  these  capacities  in  the  short  term  could  undermine \nimplementation; \n(viii)  the World Bank fiduciary assessment has concluded that the fiduciary risk high, \ngiven  the  complexity  of  funds  flow  arrangements,  the  multi-sector,  multi-\ngovernment nature of the Project, nascent stage of ERRA (including lack of \nfinancial management capacity), and weak auditing capacity and potential for \nmismanagement of funds and corruption; \n(ix)  lack of financial capacity of NWFP and AJK and the electrical companies to meet \nthe 25% counterpart funding requirement, and need to budget for sufficient funds \nto properly operate and maintain the new facilities; and \n(x)  ERRA is a new agency and while it has extraordinary authority to implement \nreconstruction quickly it has no experience.  \n133.  Physical risks will be mitigated by relocating roads, bridges, electrical lines, human \nhabitations, and other infrastructure away from the existing and potentially unstable slopes and \nnew slide areas. ERRA will conduct detailed seismic evaluations to determine alternate routes \nand locations. All new facilities will incorporate earthquake strengthening and other damage- \nmitigation measures. The logistics of access and climate will be addressed through prioritization \nof reconstruction requirements so that for this emergency loan, only those works that can \nrealistically be completed in the 3 years timeframe are included. Works with longer timeframes \nwill be scheduled under the longer term reconstruction programs that the Government is also \npreparing, which could be financed in part by future ADB loans.  \n134.  Many  of  the  existing  relief  camps  will  be  dismantled  by  next  summer  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s housing program progresses and people go back to their villages to rebuild their \nhomes. But many will need to remain for at least 18\u201324 months, while new urban areas are \nplanned and developed and basic infrastructure installed. These camps will be consolidated and \nlocated in areas of available government land. ERRA is already locating government lands for \ndevelopment as new town sites within a reasonable distance of existing urban development, to \nenable lower population densities in the larger towns. Land acquisition will be from existing \ngovernment land as much as possible. ERRA has been vested with adequate authority to follow \nemergency  land  acquisition  procedures,  which  will  only  take  a  couple  of  months.  The \nGovernment has agreed to conform to ADB\u2019s frameworks for resettlement and environmental \nimpact.                                                  \n135.  ERRA  has  been  provided  with  extraordinary  authority,  through  the  very  high  level \nCouncil, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The capacity of ERRA, the P&D and the line ", "  31\nagencies  of  the  provinces  and  the  two  electrical  companies  will  be  strengthened  through \nprovision of in house specialists that will be deputed or hired from other government agencies, \ninstitutes and the private sector, including some foreign experts to assist in the first year of the \nproject.  In  addition  adequate  consulting  services,  through  private  consulting  firms,  will  be \nrecruited  by  the  implementing  agencies  to  support  the  various  provincial  and  district  line \nagencies with all aspects of implementation.  \n136.  Implementation  and  fiduciary  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of  quality \nsubprojects in the various project sectors will be mitigated in several ways. First, detailed \nsubproject criteria will be developed, in addition to general subproject selection criteria already \nagreed to. Second, in terms of implementation, specific monitoring mechanisms will include \nregular financial audits as well as regular design and construction supervision and performance \naudits  through  random  audits  and  special  post-completion  audits.  To  undertake  such \nsupervision and performance auditing, ERRA will be supported by the dedicated provincial units \nof ERRA and specialized consulting inputs. ERRA will have a strong governance framework that \nwill combat corruption risks and to ensure that the assistance reaches the intended victims of \nthe  earthquake.  These  include  (i)  ERRA/provinces  to  ensure  equitable  and  transparent \ndistribution of rehabilitation, including beneficiary identification and publishing a computerized \nlist of affected people; (ii) transparency in procurement (iii) field monitoring through the line \nagencies and their consultants/NGOs; and (iv) financial control mechanisms by ERRA and the \nprovinces.\n137.  As the nature of this Project demands that the response be rapid, the flow of funds will \nalso need to be rapid. However, ERRA is a newly created organization, with no experience, \nwhich is nevertheless expected to follow existing procedures and fast-track them. To ensure \nmitigation of the risk of corruption and mismanagement of funds, extensive and comprehensive \nfiduciary arrangements will need to be put in place. Fiduciary risks will be further mitigated by (i) \nstrengthening the financial management capacity of ERRA and the implementing agencies, (ii) \ndeveloping financial management procedures as part of the operations manual to be prepared \nin advance of disbursement against sector components; and (iii) a shortened auditing deadline. \n138.  The weakened capacity of local consultants and contractors will be addressed through \nERRA by associating them with international consultants and contractors where possible for on-\nthe-job training and capacity building. \n139.  The provinces and the electrical distribution companies will need budgetary support from \nthe central Government to meet their 25% counterpart funds. Because of the massive damage \nmany revenue sources for the provinces have been reduced and they have extensive additional \nexpenditures due to the damaged infrastructure. Similarly, the central Government will have to \nsupport the provinces with funds for operation and maintenance of the reconstructed facilities, \npower systems, schools and hospitals and other basic services, at least in the short term until \nprovincial and electric company revenues can be restored to sustainable levels. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n140.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:     ", "32\n(i)  The Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all \nsubprojects are properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that adequate budgetary allocations of required \ncounterpart funds are made and released in a timely manner to governments of \nAJK and NWFP, and that these counterpart funds are in addition to the ongoing \ndevelopment program of each of governments of AJK and NWFP.

In  the  event  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary relocation is required for any subproject, the Government will prepare \na resettlement plan (RP) in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws \nand  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the \nagreed Resettlement Framework; and submit it to ADB for review and approval \nbefore land acquisition is initiated. The RPs will be disclosed to all affected \npersons in their own languages and the Project reporting will provide information \non land acquisition and resettlement. \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that each of the agreed Gender Action Plan and \nVulnerable People Action Plan is implemented and that adequate resources are \nallocated for this purpose in a timely manner.  \n(xiv)  The Government through ERRA will publicly disclose on the website for the \nProject  information  on  how  the  funds  are  being  used  for  the  intended \nbeneficiaries following applicable procedures. The website will present financial \nstatements and track procurement contract awards, and include information on, \namong  others,  status  of  earthquake  damages  and  casualties,  subproject \nselection  criteria,  information  on  funding  commitment  by  donors,  the  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, the list of goods and/or \nservices purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.

The earthquake that struck northern Pakistan on the morning of 8 October 2005 left \nwidespread destruction in its wake, killing at least 73,000 people, severely injuring another \n70,000, and leaving 2.8 million people without shelter. The state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir \n(AJK) and the eastern part of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) were dealt the most \nserious blow and have suffered extensive damage to economic assets and infrastructure, with \nsocial  service  delivery,  commerce,  and  communications  either  debilitated  or  destroyed.  \nVulnerable groups, mainly women and children living in inaccessible mountain areas with low \nincome and little service provision, have borne the brunt of the earthquake\u2019s impact. \n2.  In addition to the enormous human toll, the earthquake and its aftermath will pose a \nlarge  cost  to  Pakistan.  The  overall  cost  associated  with  the  earthquake  is  estimated  at \napproximately $5.2 billion, which includes the estimated costs of relief, livelihood support for \nvictims, and reconstruction (Table A2.1).\nTable A2.1:  Overall Costs of the Earthquake \nCategory  $ Million\nRelief    1,092 \nDeath and Injury Compensation  205 \nEarly Recovery    301 \nRestoration of Livelihoods    97 \nReconstruction     3,503 \nOf Which Short-Term Reconstruction  450   \nOf Which Medium/Long-Term Reconstruction   3,053   \n  Total  5,198\nNote: Excludes indirect losses (income) of $576 million (see Table A2.2) \nSources:  Relief,  Death  and  Injury  Compensation  and  Early  Recovery  (UN \nAgencies), Reconstruction and Restoration of Livelihoods (Asian Development \nBank/World Bank Assessment Team). \n3.  Preliminary  estimates  of  the  direct  damage  sustained  from  the  earthquake  total \nPRs135.1 billion ($2.3 billion), as presented in Table A2.2. These estimates are based on the \nbook value of the assets. The largest component of this damage is to private housing, which \namounts to PRs61.2 billion ($1.03 billion), followed by damage to the transport sector totaling \nPRs20.2  billion  ($340  million)  and  to  the  education  sector  equaling  PRs19.9 billion  ($335 \nmillion). Direct damage to agriculture and livestock is also sizeable, totaling PRs12.9 billion \n($218 million). Losses to industry and services amount to PRs8.6 billion ($144 million).\n4.  Direct damage is higher in AJK than in NWFP. For AJK, it amounts to PRs76.4 billion \n($1.3 billion) and for NWFP, PRs56.4 billion ($950 million). In most sectors, the destruction of \nphysical assets in AJK is higher than in NWFP, as is its monetary value.  \n5.  The indirect losses are PRs34.2 billion ($576 million) and comparable in absolute values \nbetween NWFP and AJK. The estimated indirect losses do not take into account the effect of \nrehabilitation and reconstruction activities on future output. Reconstruction will not only restore \nphysical  assets,  but  also  lead  to  renewed  production  of  goods  and  services.  Hence,  the \nestimates of indirect losses presented above are likely to be on the high side for output losses.

Introduction \n1.  The road network in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) includes about 9,430 kilometer \n(km) of primary, secondary, and local roads of which 4,020 km are paved, 420 km are fair-\nweather  and  4,990  km  are  local  or  unpaved.  The  Public  Works  Department  (PWD)  is \nresponsible for the 4,440 km paved and fair-weather roads and the Local Government and \nRural Development Department (LGRDD) manages the local roads that are the tertiary links \nconnecting villages to the existing road network. The road network in the three earthquake-\naffected districts is 5,305 km of which 2,545 km are managed by PWD and 2,760 km is the \nresponsibility of LGRDD.  \n2.  In North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), the road network consists of about 9,100 km of \nprovincial highways, secondary roads and rural roads. About 5,000 km of these roads are paved. \nThe Frontier Highway Authority (FHA) is responsible for the 2,100 km of provincial highways \nthat connects all districts and provide links to the neighboring provinces. The remaining 7,000 \nkm of roads are managed by the 24 district governments. In the five affected districts, the road \nnetwork is 6,034 km of which 549 km of provincial highways are under FHA and the rest are \nwith the districts. Three national highways serve as the primary corridor to the affected districts \nin NWFP. Managed by the NHA, these highways have a total length of about 270 km.  \nB.  Damage and Impact of the Earthquake \n3.  Due  to  the  mountainous  terrain  in  AJK  and  northern  areas  of  NWFP,  access  to \npopulation centers is by roads carved along mountainsides. The earthquake damage to these \nroads was primarily caused by landslides. Five types of damages were observed: (i) major \nlandslides causing the loss of an entire section of the mountain slope and the road traversing it; \n(ii) minor landslides depositing a large amount of debris on the road where the mountainside is \nunstable; (iii) flow of debris including large boulders on the road; (iv) severe cracking in the road \ndue to embankment failure and the upheaval of earth; and (v) unstable mountainside slopes that \nmay potentially become landslides. Lack of maintenance and extreme weather conditions will \naccelerate the deterioration of the damaged roads. Overall damage is estimated at PRs20.165 \nbillion ($339.5 million). \n4.  Bridges  were  also  affected  by  the  earthquake,  but  the  damage  to  them  was  not \nextensive. Of particular mention is Balakot bridge, on which severe damage was observed in \nthe  reinforced  concrete  superstructure  and  the  abutments.  Some  other,  smaller  concrete \nbridges, culverts, and suspension bridges on rural roads were also damaged.   \n5.  In the four affected districts of AJK (Bagh, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, and Poonch), it is \nestimated that about 2,366 km roads were damaged. Of these, 203 km are major roads, 761 km \nare other paved roads, and 182 km are unpaved roads, for a total of 1,146 km, representing \n45% of the total PWD-managed roads. The Neelam Valley road and, to a lesser extent, the \nJehlum Valley road were severely damaged. Both roads are the primary transport arteries in \nAJK. Another 1,220 km of local unpaved roads developed with community participation and \nmanaged by LGRD are damaged. This represents 44% of the total LGRDD roads in the affected \ndistricts. The assessed damage in AJK is estimated at PRs9,190 million. \n6.  In NWFP, about 2,063 km of roads were damaged representing 31% of the total road \nnetwork in the five affected districts (Abbottabad, Battagram, Kohistan, Mansehra, and Shangla). ", "48 Appendix 4 \nOf  these,  652  km  are  provincial  highways  managed  by  FHA,  1,016  km  are  other  paved \nprovincial roads managed by the districts, 367 km are unpaved districts roads, and 27 km are \nurban roads that are managed by municipal agencies. Estimate assessed damage in NWFP are \nPRs7,363 million ($124 million). \n7.  The  three  national  highways  damaged  by  the  earthquake  include  Mansehra-Pattan \n(N35), Mansehra-Naran (N15), and Kohala-Muzaffarabad (N75). The damaged length is about \n194 km representing 72% of the total length. Estimated assessed damage to the national \nhighways1 is PRs3,481 million. \nC.  Government Response to the Earthquake \n8.  As soon as initial information on the extent and scale of damages to the main national \nhighways was received, the Government mobilized all available resources at its disposal to \nclear the transport corridors to the affected areas. This effort was led by the Army Corps of \nEngineers and by the army-owned Frontier Works Organization. The latter is one of the major \nconstruction firms in the road sector and possesses a large equipment fleet and skilled human \nresources which are needed for massive emergency works. At present, the Frontier Works \nOrganization  is  continuing  with  the  work  of  clearing  the  national  highways.  The  army\u2019s \nengineering units are also involved in clearing the other provincial roads. \n9.  FHA, NWFP\u2019s Works and Services Department and AJK\u2019s PWD have mobilized all \navailable resources, including contractors and consultants already assigned to different works, \nto quickly clear and rehabilitate major roads. The variation orders to contractors and consultants \nfor immediate rehabilitation in the affected areas are eligible for retroactive financing under the \nProject.\nD.  Scope \n10.  This component will rehabilitate earthquake-damaged major roads and bridges, except \nnational highways (footnote 1), within the four affected districts in AJK (Bagh, Muzaffarabad,  \nNeelum, and Poonch) and the five affected districts in NWFP (Abbottabad, Battagram, Kohistan, \nMansehra, and Shangla). The component will cover the repair and rehabilitation of the damaged \nmajor  roads  and  bridges  under  PWD  and  LGRDD  in  AJK  and  under  FHA  and  district \ngovernments in NWFP. Road clearance now in place is not anticipated to last permanently, \nespecially beyond the coming snow season. More thorough and permanent road rebuilding is \nrequired, particularly including protection works to minimize landslides and river erosion and \nimproved drainage for slope stabilization. Rehabilitation works will restore roads and bridges to \nthe prequake level or higher standard, as this is considered cost-effective in the long run. Where \ntechnically feasible and justified, works will include protection measures to mitigate damage \nfrom future landslides. Resettlement will be minimal and will be confined to areas where the \noriginal road cannot be reconstructed and requires partial realignment. \n11.  To enhance the government\u2019s quick response to future disasters including aftershocks of \nthis earthquake, road sector agencies will need to be equipped with appropriate equipment and \nmachinery to deploy in landslide-prone areas (through the quick-disbursing component). \n                                                \n1The World Bank is financing reconstruction of the national highways through additional financing to its ongoing \nHighway Rehabilitation Project.

Damages and Impact of the Earthquake\n1.  The 8 October 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan damaged and disrupted power \ngeneration and supply systems in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the eastern part of \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP). Five companies are involved in generating power and \nsupplying it to and within the earthquake-affected areas of AJK and NWFP.  In terms of power \ngeneration  AJK  Electricity  Department  (AJKED),  Sarhad  Hydro  Development  Organization \n(SHYDO), and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) Hydel have a total of 10 \nhydro generation stations within the affected areas. In terms of power distribution, AJKED, \nIslamabad  Electric  Supply  Company  (IESCO),  and  Peshawar  Electric  Supply  Company \n(PESCO) supply electricity to the affected areas. \n2.  The power supply system was restored within days of the earthquake, but nearly all \nrepairs were temporary and need to be replaced by permanent solutions. Some areas still have \nnot yet been fully inspected because access to them is not yet possible due to the collapse of \nroads  and  continuing  landslides.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  earthquake,  it  was  necessary  to \nestablish tent villages and relief camps for dislocated people. These tent villages and relief \ncamps need to be electrified to ensure security and lighting at night, power to pump water, and \nthe efficient operation of schools and other facilities. The installation of temporary electrification \nin tent villages and relief camps needs to be funded, and the recurring costs of their electricity \nconsumption should be paid to the supplying distribution companies.  \n3.  The preliminary damage and needs assessment (PDNA) prepared for the Government \nby  a  joint Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank  team  estimated  power  sector \nreconstruction  costs  to  be  PRs1.9  billion  ($31.7  million).  Further  detailed  reconstruction \nestimates indicate that this amount will be higher when the costs of electrification and electricity \nconsumption in the growing number of tent villages and relief camps are included. In addition, \nabout 30% of electricity distribution networks in AJK and 20% in NWFP have yet to be surveyed \nfor damage and taken into consideration in the PDNA report. The contingency allocated to the \npower sector component is earmarked to address the eventual damage assessment in the \nareas not yet inspected. \nB.  Project Scope\n4.  The Project component comprises rehabilitation of the power generation and supply \nsystem infrastructure that was damaged during the earthquake, and the electrification of tent \nand relief camps as well as related electricity supply to these camps for up to 2 years.  In detail, \nthe Project will cover (i) repair of nine hydropower generation stations inclusive of access roads, \nbuildings, and ancillary facilities; (ii) supply and installation of equipment and lines related to the \n132kV, 33kV, and 11kV substations; (iii) construction of operational buildings of substations and \nrelated  staff  quarters;  (iv)  0.4kV  and  0.22kV  low  voltage  lines  (v)  service  connections  to \nconsumers; vi) spare parts, operational vehicles, and tools (vii) installation of transformers, \nmeters,  and  service  connections  to  the  tent  villages  and  relief  camps  established  after  8 \nOctober 2005; (viii) payment for electricity supply for up to two years to the tent villages and \nrelief  camps,  and  (ix)  installation  of  transformers,  meters,  and  service  connections  to  the \nanticipated  new  model  villages  to  be  established  for  the  victims  of  the  earthquake.  \nReconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  the  facilities  to  pre-\nearthquake levels or to a higher standard as considered cost-effective in the medium to long - ", "52 Appendix 5 \nterm. The installation of electricity to the tent villages and relief camps will be done with safety of \nthe occupants and the network as a high priority.  \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n5.  The  cost  of  the  power  sector  component  is  estimated  at  $53.5  million  equivalent, \nincluding a foreign exchange cost of $24.0 million. The local currency cost is $29.5 million \nequivalent and includes local taxes and duties of approximately $2.5 million. Interest during \nconstruction will be paid by the Government and amounts to $0.4 million for the power sector \ncomponent.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management\n9.  There  are  four  implementing  agencies  within  the  power  sector  component,  namely \nAJKED, IESCO, PESCO, and SHYDO.  Each implementing agency has been provided an \nallocated directly related to the damages and reconstruction needs within their respective areas, \nand accordingly each implementing agency will be responsible for development of respective \nsubprojects. The implementing agencies will be responsible for the implementation of their \nrespective subprojects.  \n2.  Implementation Schedule\n10.  All reconstruction works are scheduled to be completed within 3 years. The detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n3.  Procurement\n11.  The procurement procedures for the power sector component are identical to those of \nthe overall Project. \n4.  Consulting Services\n12.  The implementing agencies in the power sector have, for the most part, the capabilities \nand technical expertise to implement the power sector component of the Project.  However, to \nassist with development of procurement packages inclusive of establishment of specifications, \nto ensure transparency, and independent monitoring, consulting services will be required to \nassist the implementing agencies with (i) preparation of the subproject proposals to ensure \ncompliance with subproject criteria, (ii) preparation of detail design, cost estimates, and bidding \ndocuments, (iii) conduct general construction and installation supervision, (iv) random checking \nfor quality assurance purposes, (v) undertake and prepare required environment and social \nassessment studies including resettlement plan to ensure compliance with the Government and \nADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies. The consultants will have expertise in (i) \nelectrical engineering specifically in power supply systems, and (ii) structural engineering for \nbuildings.   \n13.  The consultants will be hired by the concerned implementing agency with the approval of \nERRA or SC as the case may be. The outline terms of reference of the consultants are in \nSupplementary Appendix D. ", "Appendix 6  55\nSOCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Background \n1.  Before the earthquake, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) had adequate primary and \nsecondary healthcare facilities as well as referral hospitals for its population of 3.4 million. There \nwere seven district hospitals, six subdistrict hospitals, 31 rural health centers, 184 basic health \nunits, and 105 dispensaries. The district hospitals provided coverage to both the urban and rural \npopulations of the districts.  \n2.  The damage assessment survey jointly undertaken by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and World Bank found that the extent of damage to the health sector in AJK far exceeds \ninitial expectations. The assessment reported that health facilities were completely destroyed or \nmade irreparable in Bagh and Poonch districts. The damage in Muzaffarabad is reported at 70\u2013\n80% of the entire health infrastructure of the district. Besides the infrastructure, most of the \nmedical and office equipment, furniture, drugs, and laboratories were destroyed. Information on \nambulances  and  supervisory  vehicles  is  not  available  but  21  four-wheel  vehicles  and  six \nmotorcycles  have  been  reported  destroyed.  These  losses  have  resulted  in  a  complete \nbreakdown  of  the  health  system,  severely  disrupting  the  provision  of  both  secondary  and \nprimary healthcare services. In addition, health management at the central, district, and facility \nlevel was paralyzed, and most official and health management information records and systems \nwere lost.\nTable A6.1: Summary of Damage to the Healthcare System in Affected Areas \nNumber Number Estimated\nType of Health \nFully  Partly  Replacement Cost in \nInstitution/Offices\nDamaged Damaged PRs (millions) \nTertiary care hospital  0  1  500 \nSecondary care (district,  16  13 \nsubdistrict, and civil hospitals)  6,798\nFirst-level healthcare facilities  203  68 \n(RHCs, BHUs and MCH centers) 8,091\nOther health facilities  218  32 \n(dispensaries, first-aid posts, etc)  159\nHealth management offices  17  3  318 \nTotal health facilities  454  117  15,866 \nLost vehicles/motorcycles   21/6  0  22 \nTotal      15,888 \n3.  Prior to the earthquake, the literacy rate in AJK was estimated to be 64% of the total \npopulation, or about 56% among females and 80% among males. Education has remained a \npriority with the AJK government, as about 27% of its total recurring budget is allocated to \neducation. The damage assessment survey has identified Bagh, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, and \nPoonch (Rawlakot) as the worst affected districts in AJK with regards to education. The total \nnumber of government schools and colleges in AJK prior to the earthquake was 7,258. Of these, \n3,879, or 53%, were in the three worst affected districts. There were 290,000 students (44% \ngirls) and 12,971 teachers in these three districts.  \n4.  Educational institutions of all levels, from primary schools to degree colleges and the \nuniversity,  have  suffered  substantial  damage.  Apart  from  damage  to  the  institutions  and \nbuildings, the sector has lost people. According to a United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) ", "56 Appendix 6 \nreport, almost half of the casualties of the earthquake were children of school age. The number \nof lost school staff and teachers is 853 for both AJK and NWFP. \nTable A6.2:  Summary of Damage to Educational Institutions \nAJK\nNumber of  Estimated\nInstitutions % of Total \nDamaged Cost\nCost\nInstitutions (PRs million) \nGovernment primary   2,153   3,064  22 \nGovernment middle   565    1,341  10 \nGovernment high   312    1,473  11 \nGovernment higher second   27    188  1 \nGovernment intercollege   25    78  1 \nGovernment colleges and   28    1,260   9 \npostgraduate \nTechnical/vocational       \nPrivate  574   2,620  19 \nAJK University  1  3,463  12 \nMaterials and furniture  0            2,036a  15 \nAdministration buildings  0  0   \n  Total  3,685   13,660  100 \nAJK = Azad Jammu and Kashmir. \na  Cost of materials, equipment, and furniture includes PRs540 million for AJK University. \n5.  ADB is processing an emergency assistance package for the earthquake-affected areas. \nApart from other sectors, the government of AJK has shown interest in securing funds to \nsupport the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the essential social sector infrastructure. The \nsocial sector component will focus on reconstructing and rehabilitating selected health and \neducation facilities located within the affected districts.  \nB.   Objective \n6.  The  objective  of  this  component  is  to  address  the  greatest  social-sector  needs  of \nearthquake-affected people. District and subdistrict headquarters being the major urban centers \nof AJK, people from remote areas use the health and educational facilities in these places. The \ntask of reconstructing and rehabilitating social-sector facilities is gigantic and will take place over \na  period  of  time.  Most  of  the  locations  where  primary  health  and  education  services  are \ndamaged are remote and difficult to get to because of damaged roads. The capacity and \noutreach required to build these services both in the public and private sector has to be put in \nplace before work can begin on rebuilding these facilities. However, work can begin immediately \nin such urban areas as district and subdistrict headquarters and in accessible rural areas, and \nwhere capacities are currently concentrated. The urban centers and larger rural settlements are \nthe worst affected, as these were densely populated. Immediate restoration of heath facilities \nand education in these centers will benefit the most people, apart from accommodating people \nfrom surrounding areas in the short term. This approach is advocated in the short-term recovery \nstrategy recommended in the damage and need assessment and agreed with the Government. ", "Appendix 6  57\n7.  In the health sector, the present arrangement in the emergency relief phase is that \nvarious  field  hospitals  provide  emergency  healthcare  assistance  to  people  in  Bagh, \nMuzaffarabad,  and  Rawlakot.  The  seriously  injured  are  being  referred  to  Rawalpindi  and \nAbbotabad for treatment. Prior to the earthquake, there was one referral health facility at each \ndistrict headquarters. In addition, there was a hospital in each subdistrict headquarters. In \nMuzaffarabad, the capital of AJK, the 400-bed Combined Military Hospital was administratively \nunder the armed forces but with the government of AJK providing 80% of its administrative \ncosts. The other hospital in Muzaffarabad was the 300-bed Abbas Institute of Medical Sciences, \nwhich  provided  referral  services  to  the  civilian  population  of  AJK.  As  these  facilities  have \nsuffered irreparable damage for the most part, practically no referral facilities exist today. In the \nshort term, many relief agencies are providing these services through makeshift hospitals that \nhave concentrated the population seeking medical aid in Muzaffarabad and other major urban \ncenters in AJK. This temporary relief infrastructure is expected to start thinning out very soon, \nand there will be immense pressure to provide referral services in districts and subdistricts. The \nhealth component will focus on reconstructing one hospital in district headquarters with 150\u2013250 \nbeds each and three hospitals in subdistrict headquarters with 60\u201380 beds each. All of these \nhospitals will be equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities to provide referral facilities for \npeople  from  all  parts  of  AJK,  but  particularly  from  earthquake-affected  districts.  Health \nadministration buildings have also been seriously damaged, which seriously hampers the ability \nof the Health Department to respond to the emergency.  The component will also provide for the \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of health management buildings. \n8.  In ongoing relief and rescue operations, many agencies focus on providing temporary \nstructures for primary education institutions, but middle and high schools are too big for these \nagencies to handle. In addition, as in the health sector, primary education facilities are scattered, \nsituated at remote locations and currently difficult to reach. As the immediate need identified in \nthe  reconstruction  strategy  for  education  is  to  restart  classes,  the  reconstructed  and \nrehabilitated middle and high schools can also be used to accommodate students of the nearby \nprimary schools over the short term. The resumption of routine school activities would help \nestablish some kind of normalcy in the lives of the school children, teachers, and staff. The \ncomponent will focus on reconstructing and rehabilitating 550 government middle schools and \n300  high  schools,  including  the  provision  of  all  essential  furniture  and  equipment.  The \ncomponent will also assess, and advise on, the physical and psychological health of students, \nas well as train trainers for teacher training. \nC.   Scope \n9.  The health subcomponent will include (i) construction of one (150 to 250 bedded) district \nhospital and three (40\u201380 bedded) Tehsil headquarter hospitals, including wards, operation \ntheatres, outpatient departments and other necessary services; (ii) provision of all the essential \nmedical equipment to the hospitals including ambulances and supplies; (iii) construction of \nproper waiting areas and provision of public toilets and clean drinking water for visitors; and iv) \nconsultancy  and  administrative  assistance  including  health  management  planning.  German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation is actively negotiating a soft component for the health sector, \nwhich  will  include  training  management  support  and  systems,  and  planning  to  be \noperationalized in parallel with the ADB emergency assistance loan. \n10.  The education subcomponent would include: (i) repair and reconstruction, according to \nimproved seismic designs of about 550 partly and completely damaged government middle \nschools  building,  latrines,  office  accommodation  (ii)  provision  of  all  essential  furniture  and \nequipment for all the middle schools reconstructed and repaired; (iii) training of master trainers ", "58 Appendix 6 \nfor  teachers  training;  (iv)  school  health  services  for  physical  and  physiological  health \nassessment and advise; and (v) consultancy and administrative assistance. \nD.  Cost Estimates \n11.  The cost of the health subcomponent is estimated at $29.7 million including taxes and \nduties of approximately $1.6 million. The cost of the education subcomponent is estimated at \n$23.6  million  including  taxes  and  duties  of  approximately  $1.0  million.

Selection Criteria \n13.  The selection of the various facilities under the Project will be based on the needs \nassessment  exercise  jointly  undertaken  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB.  It  also  takes  into \nconsideration the priorities determined by the government of AJK for additional activities to be \nundertaken as part of the Multisector Rehabilitation and Improvement Project in AJK. The \nselection is based on the following criteria: \n(i)  Social sector facilities located in the earthquake affected zone in AJK; \n(ii)  Addressing the basic emergency needs in the affected areas; \n(iii)  No overlap of assistance from other donors for the assistance;  ", "Appendix 6  59\n(iv)  Determined as priority for ADB assistance by Government of AJK; and \n(v)  Subprojects are technical feasible, cost efficient and financially sustainable. \nF. Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The social component of the emergency assistance will be implemented through the \nimplementation arrangement established under the ongoing Loan 2153 PAK (SF) Multisector \nRehabilitation and Improvement Project for AJK, by further strengthening the existing project \nmanagement  units  and  project  implement  units  (PIUs)  with  staff  and  technical  assistance \nconsultants, if the SC decides to use this existing mechanism as implementing agency for \nsubprojects. The Multisector Rehabilitation and Improvement Project for AJK is at the take-off \nphase with implementation arrangements in place and activities in the various sectors about to \nbe  initiated.  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  will  undertake  civil  works  through  the  Works \nDepartment or RA. Consulting services will be required to assist the DOH or RA as the case \nmay be: (i) in the preparation of the layout for the hospitals including detailed engineering with \nseismic  provisions,  bid  preparation,  assistance  in  procurement  and  construction, \nsupervision/contract administration of civil works, and procurement of equipment; (ii) determine \nthe needs of the equipments in consultation with the administration of the hospital and specialist \nconsultants;  (iii)  project  management  and  reporting;  and  (iv)  assess  and  undertake  any \nnecessary study to ensure compliance with ADB and the Government\u2019s environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  policies.  The  health  subcomponent  will  require  20  person-months  of \ninternational consultancy services, mainly providing health management specialist services and \ntechnical advice, and 200 person-months of domestic consulting services for surveys, design, \nsupervision, and project management. In addition, the implementing agency (which can be RA \nor DOH) of health will require strengthening in terms of both human resources and capacity, for \nwhich administrative support will be provided. \n15.  For education, the AJK Department of Education (DOE) will be the implementing agency. \nA previously existing headed by a project implementation officer with essential staff has been \nestablished within the DOE to oversee implementation. The PIU will be responsible for overall \nmanagement  of  the  education  component,  including  (i)  procurement  of  civil  works  and \nequipments, (ii) coordination with other departments and line agencies, (iii) progress monitoring, \nand  (iv)  audit  of  accounts  and  preparation  of  progress  reports.  The  PIU  will  undertake \nprocurement through an interdepartmental purchase committee established within the DOE but \nhaving representation of the Finance Department and P&D Department. DOE will undertake \ncivil works through their own Public Works Department. Consulting services will be required to \nassist the DOE with (i) the preparation of the layout for high and middle schools including \ndetailed engineering with seismic provisions, bid preparation, assistance in procurement and \nconstruction, supervision/contract administration of civil works, and procurement of equipment; \nand (ii) project management and reporting. The education subcomponent will require 20 person-\nmonths of international consultancy services, mainly providing education management specialist \nservices and technical advice, and 200 person-months of domestic consulting services for \nsurveys,  design,  supervision,  and  project  management.  In  addition,  the  PIU  will  require \nstrengthening in terms of both human resources and capacity, for which administrative support \nwill be provided.

The destruction caused by the earthquake has created legal and documentary issues for \nearthquake affected people and generated a tremendous strain on government administration \nand resources, at national, provincial and local levels. This subcomponent seeks to assist the \nfederal,  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  and  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK) \ngovernments to build institutional strength and capacity to effectively deal with issues and risks \nassociated with restoring lost documents and helping earthquake victims retain their legal rights \nand entitlements in a timely and effective manner. This subcomponent also seeks to build local \ngovernment capacity to provide special services to earthquake-affected people, especially those \nwho  are  more  vulnerable.  The  subcomponent  aims  to  compliment  and  support  existing \nadministration  structures,  wherever  possible.  This  subcomponent  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  following  principles:  (i)  affected  people  are  offered  people-centered \nsolutions and recognition is given, at an early stage that vulnerable groups require special and \nurgent arrangements; (ii) rehabilitation activity is designed for, and implemented by, the lowest \nlevel of  mandated and competent agency; (iii) durable arrangements are made, which assign \nclear responsibilities for central and localized strategic coordination; (iv) needs and sectoral \ntechnical responses are assessed and defined in ways that avoid unmanageable demands; (v) \ninnovative  institutional  arrangements  are  created  (even  if  only  temporary)  through  which \nspecialized expertise can be quickly mobilized and held accountable; and (vi) validation, audit, \naccountability, judicial and quasi-judicial arrangements are stipulated with a clearer view of \nenhancing the predictability of outcomes for disaster-affected people. Details of implementation \narrangements  under  this  subcomponent,  including  the  appointment  of  the  implementing \nagencies,  will  be  developed,  taking  into  consideration  changing  circumstances.  The \nimplementing agencies with assistance from ADB resource person will be responsible for the \nimplementation of this subcomponent. Details on each activity under this subcomponent are \ndescribed below. \n2.  The constituent parts of the legal assistance, governance, and institutional building, \nwhich may be streamlined or augmented following discussions with the Government and other \ndevelopment partners, are described below: \nA.  Provision of National Identity Cards   \n3.  The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) is the agency that issues \nnational identity cards (NICs). Following the earthquake, thousands of NICs will need to be \nreplaced, and those people previously without NICs will need to be issued NICs in order to \nsecure compensation entitlement and other rights. NICs are also used in legal proceedings and \nestablishing  property  and  inheritance  rights.  Issuing  of  new  or  replacement  NICs  will \nsignificantly reduce the incidence of fraud. Consideration also needs to be given to providing \nNICs  to  children  in  order  to  facilitate  the  identification  and  repatriation  of  abandoned  or \ndisplaced children with their families or relatives, requiring a review of the legal framework to \nmake provision for children\u2019s NIC. \n4.  Currently, NADRA is attempting to issue NICs under its existing modalities, however this \nwill not be sufficient to meet the urgent needs of the earthquake-affected people. Issuing NICs \nto earthquake-affected people cannot be delayed. It will be necessary to develop new modalities \nin order to meet the demand arising from the earthquake. This may include relaxation of certain \nprocedures used to verify identity, (e.g. Union Council members or other appropriate local \nleaders will be involved in attesting the accuracy of information provided by villagers, so that an \nalternative form of attestation will be developed), the requirement for the payment of fees and ", "Appendix 7  61\nthe establishment of localized offices and additional mobile units with the necessary equipment. \nOther Government departments such as the Central Board of Revenue and local revenue \ndepartments could be used to assist in the identification process in order to speed up the \nprocess.\n5.  This subproject will support NADRA in its efforts to improve its capacity to issue NICs to \nearthquake  affected  people  as  expeditiously  as  possible  and  to  develop  its  outreach  to \nvulnerable people such as women and children. Support may also be considered for additional \nstaff,  necessary  additional  computer  equipment,  networking  and  connectivity  components, \nphotographic equipment, as well as the purchase of mobile units and office items. The staff of \nthe  mobile  units  will  include  at  least  one  woman  to  ensure  that  female  villagers  have \nopportunities to obtain NICs. \nB.  Provision of Documents \n6.  The Local Government, Elections, and Rural Development Department of NWFP and \nthe Local Government and Rural Development Department of the AJK would normally oversee \nthe registration of births, deaths, and marriages. With respect to title or ownership documents \nfor land, these would be issued by revenue officers, variously known as district officer (revenue) \nand deputy district officer (revenue) in NWFP and collector or assistant collector in AJK. These \ndepartments  would  be  responsible  for  providing  duplicates  of  documents  destroyed  in  the \nearthquake.  \n7.  The Project will provide support to these departments by assisting them in developing \nnew  modalities  in  order  to  expedite  the  process  of  providing  duplicates  of  documents. \nComputerization will be considered where feasible as well as provision of mobile units. Special \nprocedures will be required to be provided for quake affected areas with regard to death \ncertification. Provision will be required to be made for acceptance of this certification by courts \nof law for grant of succession certificates, declaratory suits, and revenue officers for mutation of \nrights in the name of legal heirs. There will also be the need to consider alternative processes \nfor the presumption of death. Currently, the presumption of death in relation to a missing person \nis seven years.  Support will be provided to allow local government officers/revenue officers  to \nvisit  areas  affected  by  the  earthquake  in  order  to  issue  duplicates  of  birth  and  marriage \ncertificates  and  issue  death  certificates  and  outreach  to  the  most  seriously  affected  and \nvulnerable people. In addition to these efforts, there will also be a need to launch an effective \npublic awareness campaign so that earthquake affected people are made aware of their rights \nto be issued with duplicates of documents and the new modalities regarding their issue.  \n8.  Disability  certificates  need  to  be  issued  by  the  Medical  Superintendent,  District \nHeadquarters Hospital, to ensure that disabled persons have access to disability entitlements. \nCo-ordination needs to be strengthened between the executive district officer (health) in NWFP \nand the district health officers in AJK, who are responsible for local basic health units and \nregional  health  units,  and  the  medical  superintendent  to  reach  out  to  local  communities. \nCapacity-building may be necessary to deal with disability, health and entitlement issues.  \n9.  The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) needs to ensure that pensioners, including \nwidows, are facilitated to obtain their pension entitlements. Where public servants have been \ndisabled, the AGP may consider pensioning the disabled on the basis of early retirement. \nCoordination is necessary between AGP and medical superintendent and local government \nofficial to facilitate affected people to obtain pension entitlements. ", "62 Appendix 7 \nC.  Legal Facilitation and Assistance   \n10.  The destruction brought about by the earthquake has, as discussed above, generated \nlegal and documentary issues for earthquake-affected people and the Government. Such legal \nissues arise from the loss of documents, such as property titles; birth, death, marriage, and \ndisability certificates; court records; and bank account and pension documents. They also arise \nfrom the devastating loss of life caused by the earthquake, as following these mass deaths, \nproof of death, disability, custody, fostering, and adoption of children, and the inheritance of real \nand  personal  property  have  all  arisen  as  problems.  Issues  such  as  insurance  coverage, \nenhancing  the  limitation  period  for  claiming  compensation,  property  disputes,  and  other \nentitlement issues are follow-on concerns.\n11.  This activity will support the Government in developing a legislative framework for the \npost earthquake reconstruction period to enable special legal provisions for people and property \naffected by the earthquake, and related purposes. Legislation under the framework will include (i) \nshortening the period for the presumption of death, (ii) providing for the custody, fostering, and \nadoption  of  children,  (iii)  establishing  special  institutional  and  legal  arrangements  for  the \nprotection  of  orphaned  or  displaced  children,  women  and  the  disabled  persons,  and  their \nproperty, and (iv) increasing the vigilance against abduction and human trafficking. Provisions \nrelating to the protection of property rights through inheritance would also need to be introduced. \nConsideration should also be given to enhance the penalty for any crime, if it is committed in \nrelation to property or money intended for earthquake affectees or relief.  \n12.  To translate formal legal solutions into solutions for earthquake-affected people will \nrequire them, and divisional and district level government officials and affected citizens, to \nunderstand the new legal requirements, and be able to proceed along appropriate channels. \nThey will also need to have assistance to resolve any legal questions that may arise. Members \nof the law and administration of justice system in earthquake-affected areas will similarly need \nto be made aware of the mechanisms for resolving earthquake related legal and administrative \nproblems.  In  the  earthquake  affected  areas  already  poor  and  vulnerable  people  will  have \ndifficulty negotiating formal avenues, and will clearly need assistance to avail themselves of any \nnew laws and procedures. \n13.  As an activity of this subcomponent, legal facilitation and assistance for earthquake- \nrelated legal and documentary issues would be provided to earthquake affected people. The \nprovision of assistance would be functionally decentralized in the affected areas of NWFP and \nAJK. Staff would have access to transportation in order to conduct outreach, by visiting affected \ncommunities, and to service all relevant areas. ADB will coordinate with the Government and \nofficials of the earthquake affected districts to determine the number of legal facilitators required \nfor a particular area. However, certain districts may need more assistance than others.  \n14.  A subcomponent coordinator or director, with assistance from at least one staff member, \nwill  coordinate  this  activity,  facilitate  cross  learning  amongst  the  decentralized  offices  and \nmonitor the conduct of legal services. This activity will be closely coordinated with the civil \nsociety organizations (CSOs), and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other relevant \ndevelopment partners. ", "Appendix 7  63\nD.  Judicial, Police and Public Officials Training Workshops and Legal Awareness \n15.  Judges, court officials, police and revenue officers in the earthquake-affected areas \nneed to be familiarized with the property and custody legal issues likely to arise post-earthquake, \nand the special post earthquake legislative framework when enacted. The types of legal issues \nthat  are  likely  to  arise  can  be  anticipated,  including,  for  example,  property,  inheritance, \ncompensation, rights of orphans, disabled and widows, however the details of the sorts of \ndisputes have not yet been identified. Based on more detailed data identifying the nature of \nearthquake-related legal disputes likely to come before the courts, ADB in conjunction with the \nGovernment would coordinate training of judicial revenue officials and police, and public legal \nawareness workshops in or for the earthquake-affected areas. \n16.  The earthquake legislative framework referred to in paragraph 10 above, will presume \nknowledge  of  the  law  and  imposes  harsh  jail  penalties  for  violations.  Legal  awareness \nworkshops  will  be  coordinated  for  district  officials,  local  law  enforcers,  and  the  public,  in \nconjunction with, or independently from the judicial workshops for earthquake related issues. \nE.  Public Grievance Review Mechanism \n17.  The legal and factual issues generated by the earthquake, are likely to lead to increased \ndisputes  and  grievances  both  among  earthquake  affected  people,  and  possibly  against \ngovernment officers and departments. The Government will need to ensure that all earthquake \nrelief and reconstruction efforts promote transparency, participation, accountability, and a zero-\ntolerance for any corruption associated with earthquake assistance. Similarly the proposed \nearthquake legislative framework would increase penalties for earthquake related crimes and \nimproprieties.\n18.  The  pre-earthquake  public  redress  procedures  were  a  patchwork  of  federal  and \nprovincial systems with mixed resources and mixed results. Those systems that can operate \neffectively following the earthquake will be supported. Consideration will be given as to whether \nthe  regulatory  framework,  capacity,  accessibility  and  reach  of  the  existing  institutions  are \nadequate.\n19.  In furtherance of the Government\u2019s objectives, and to assist earthquake affected people \nwith disputes and grievances, it may be necessary to create a decentralized provincial system \nof public grievance review and alternative dispute resolution will be established or supported in \nthe earthquake affected areas and staffed by independent persons. The mechanisms would \nseek to resolve private disputes, and investigate claims of impropriety against public officials \nrelating  to  earthquake  assistance.  Proposals  for  achieving  this  end  are  currently  being \nconsidered. In consultation with the Government, NWFP, AJK and NGOs, a number of tried and \ntested mechanisms will be reviewed, in order to determine the most appropriate way to provide \nforms of dispute resolution, public grievance review, and anti-corruption forum, in the context of \nconditions on the ground in earthquake affected areas. \nF.  Transparency and Earthquake Data Collection \n20.  The Office of the President, through the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation \nAuthority (ERRA), will begin to coordinate the many separate efforts to collect data in relation to \nearthquake  affected  infrastructure  and  earthquake  affected  people.  This  coordination  will \ninclude NADRA, the Central Board of Revenue, relevant local government departments, CSOs \nand NGOs. Centralization of data collection will minimize duplications of efforts, focus relief ", "64 Appendix 7 \nefforts to those earthquake affected people who need it the most and limit the extent to which \nearthquake affected people are approached by multiple government agencies and NGOs for \nsimilar data collection questions. In the longer term, such data collection will be invaluable to the \ngovernmental and other relief agencies for future planning and understanding lessons learned. \n21.  This activity will support ERRA in coordinating this activity by providing data collection \nmanagers who can train staff and advice on connectivity of data and networking issues. Subject \nto an initial technical and needs assessment, consideration may also be given for the provision \nof computer equipment, software licenses and the recruitment of new staff. \n22.  Transparency  and  access  to  information  standards  need  to  be  agreed  so  that \nstakeholders are aware of transparency and access to information obligations. Local institutions \nsuch LGO monitoring committees and NGOs, CSOs and local media may be engaged to \nenhance  transparency  and  the  flow  of  information.  Provision  of  information  management \nsystems, computerization and networking will need to be supported. \n23.  In addition, ERRA will facilitate the coordination required to ensure that information on \nearthquake assistance, post earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction, names of affectees \nand extent of damage suffered by them, and related laws and policies, will be placed on an \nearthquake website, and published in English, Pushtoo, and Urdu in local newspapers as well \nas on national and provincial television and radio. To keep the public notified, these publications \nand  broadcasts  will  be  regularly  updated  at  least  every  quarter.  This  would  require  some \ncoordination amongst departments, donors, and NGOs to obtain the appropriate information. \nThe information to be included should present financial statements, track procurement contract \nawards, including its amount, and basic information on the processes adopted, list of goods or \nservices purchased and their utilization. \nG.  Vocational Training  \n24.  The earthquake left many households without any income-generating capacity. Many of \nthese household have lost their breadwinner. Single women and widows now face the need to \nprovide for their families. Many of them will have to enter the job market, often for the first time. \nThe  need arises  to  provide  them  with  free vocational  training,  designed  to  give  them  the \npossibility  to  approach  the  market  as  semi-skilled  labor  for  positions  which  are  socially \nacceptable. Another group of vulnerable people, who may need to enter the job market and \nneed special training, are the disabled. In fact, disabled are equally capable to produce income \nand can be a valuable source of income for their families. For this reason they need to be given \nequal opportunity of access to the labor market and accordingly, they will also need special \nassistance. In both cases, there is also the need to assist the trainees in finding a job, once the \ntraining has been completed. This activity aims at building and strengthening the capacity of \nlocal governments in delivering and managing training programs designed to reach vulnerable \npeople who have been particularly affected by the earthquake and need targeted assistance \nand complements the vulnerable people action plan in Appendix 17 and the gender action Plan \nin Appendix 16. \n25.  The special training needs to be designed by specialized consultants. These consultants \nwill work with the relevant departments of NWPF and AJK to strengthen their capacity to deliver \nsuch  trainings  and  to  facilitate  the  participation  of  the  target  groups  to  the  courses.  The \nconsultants will also design and implement a program of post-training assistance to find jobs. ", "Appendix 7  65\nH.  ADB\u2019s Approach to Implementation \n26.  From its involvement in other natural disasters, ADB has learned that post disaster \nrehabilitation  and  recovery  is  most  effective  when  (i)  affected  people  are  offered  people- \ncentered solutions and recognition is given, at an early stage, that vulnerable groups require \nspecial and urgent arrangements; (ii) rehabilitation activity is designed for, and implemented by, \nthe lowest level of mandated and competent agency; (iii) durable arrangements are made, \nwhich assign clear responsibilities for central and localized strategic coordination; (iv) needs and \nsectoral  technical  responses  are  assessed  and  defined  in  ways  that  avoid  unmanageable \ndemands; (v) innovative institutional arrangements are created (even if only temporary) through \nwhich specialized expertise can be quickly mobilized and held accountable; and (vi) validation, \naudit, accountability, judicial and quasi-judicial arrangements are stipulated with a clear view of \nenhancing the predictability of outcomes for disaster affected people. \n27.  ADB will work with the federal Government and with NWFP province and AJK state \nGovernments to ensure that this subcomponent is implemented in a manner which incorporates \nthe principles set out in paragraph 21 above. As the Government and other development \npartners are working in related areas, there will be a need to continue coordination to ensure \nthat Government and development partner activities, as well as those of the ADB, complement \neach others activities.  \n28.  Consistent with the sector approach adopted for the entire Project, ADB\u2019s assistance will \nseek  to  support  good  governance,  anti-corruption,  and  the  legal  and  public  administrative \ninfrastructure through cofinance, and gap-filling in areas not yet covered, and in areas where \nADB has a comparative advantage. ADB will actively coordinate with development partners and \nthe Government to minimize duplication, encourage cofinancing and have a catalytic effect on \nthe provision of additional resources. To provide against the duplication of efforts, the allocation \nof ADB funds for this activity may be adjusted to ensure delivery of balanced and demand \nresponsive institutional assistance. \n29.  This subcomponent will be coordinated through ERRA. Advisory technical assistance \nengaged by ADB and associated contracts to implement activities in an agreed annual work \nplan will be administered by ADB under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB.

Eligibility Criteria for Subprojects  \n1.  The subprojects will be for rehabilitation of earthquake-damaged infrastructure in the \ntransport,  power,  and  health  and  education  sectors.  The  eligibility  criteria  listed  represent \nthreshold general selection criteria for a subproject to be satisfied prior to application of sector-\nspecific criteria. \n(i)  The subproject will rehabilitate or restore damaged infrastructure and facilities \ncaused  by  the  earthquake,  based  on  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment, and assessments carried out by the project consultants. \n(ii)  The subproject is technically feasible, cost-effective and financially sustainable, \nincorporates  multi-hazard-resistant  design  standards  of  the  Government  of \nPakistan or equivalent authorities; and represents a least-cost alternative. \n(iii)  The subproject will incorporate beneficiary consultation and input in the selection \nprocess where applicable. \n(iv)  The subproject will be completed within the project implementation period. \n(v)  The funding of the subproject will not overlap with funding from other agencies, \nthough such agencies may cofinance specified support, including monitoring, \ncapacity building, and identified poverty reduction. \n(vi)  All  necessary  approvals  of  the  national  and  respective  state/provincial \ngovernments  will  be  obtained  for  the  subprojects  before  submission  by  the \nimplementing agencies to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval. \n(vii)  Subprojects will be prioritized on the basis of their social and economic impacts. \n(viii)  The subproject is: (a) in compliance with applicable national and state laws and \nADB Environment  Policy  (2002);  and  (b)  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements of an agreed environmental assessment and review framework. \nSubprojects that do not satisfy the framework will not be included under the \nProject. For subprojects that require an initial environmental examination (IEE): \n(a) the IEE is included in the subproject proposal; (b) the related environment \nmanagement and monitoring plan is prepared for design and implementation; \nand (c) Government environment clearance including all necessary clearances \nas applicable for respective states is obtained prior to award of the subproject \ncontract.

All  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  processed  in  accordance  with  the  following \nprocedures (Table A10): \n(i)  The implementing agencies will select a subproject from the list agreed with ADB \nduring the loan inception mission for the Project, or propose other subprojects that \nqualify given the eligibility criteria and prepare a project concept paper, which \ndescribes the main elements of the proposed subprojects and main justification, \nand  (a)  categorize  resettlement  significance  using  resettlement  categorization \nchecklist  and  (b)  environmental  screening  checklist.  As  this  Project  is  in \nenvironment category B, the relevant procedures apply. \n(ii)   The  above  checklists  will  be  submitted  to  the  implementing  agencies  in  the \nrespective states for review. If the implementing agencies find that the proposed \nsubproject is eligible in light of the eligibility criteria and the reports are in order, \nimplementing agencies will send the reports to ADB for further review, to obtain \nnecessary guidance with regard to the extent of relevant analysis, assessment, \nplan, etc. \n(iii)  ADB will review the subproject concept reports submitted by the implementing \nagencies/SCs. If ADB finds that a proposed subproject is not likely to satisfy the \neligibility criteria and/or the agreed procedures, ADB will advise the implementing \nagency either (a) to modify the subproject proposal in a manner that will make it \neligible for approval or (b) that the subproject must be rejected. If a subproject is \nrejected, the IA may propose a replacement subproject. If the proposed subproject \nsatisfies the eligibility criteria and procedures, based on the resettlement checklist, \nADB  will  advise  on  the  requirements  of  preparation  and  application  of  the \nresettlement plan. \n(iv)  Following approval of a subproject concept by implementing agencies, SCs and \nADB,  the  relevant  implementing  agency  will  conduct  a  feasibility  study  and \npreliminary  design  or  other  similar  design  works,  and  based  on  those  works, \ndevelop  a  resettlement  plan  (if  required)  and  undertake  an  IEE  including  an \nenvironmental management plan. \n(v)  The  implementing  agency  will  disclose  the  resettlement  plan  and  IEE  to  the \naffected persons and incorporate the results of the consultation. \n(vi)  The  report  of  the  feasibility  study  and  preliminary  design/other  design  work, \nincluding the resettlement plan and IEE, will be submitted by the implementing \nagency  to  the  SC  for  its  appraisal.  The  implementing  agencies  and  SCs  will \nappraise the reports in light of the relevant frameworks. Based on the review, the \nimplementing agencies/SCs will prepare a summary appraisal report for each of \nthe subprojects as the case may be. If the implementing agency finds that one or \nmore proposed subprojects are technically, environmentally, and socially viable, \nand all reports are in order, the implementing agency will send those reports, with \nattachments  including  the  resettlement  plan  (if  required)  and  IEE,  to  ADB  for \nfurther review and approval. \n(vii)  ADB will review the summary appraisal reports, together with required attachments. \nIf  ADB  finds  that  the  proposed  subproject  satisfies  the  eligibility  criteria  and \nprocedures,  ADB  will  approve  the  subproject.

In particular, transport and power infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  will  revive  economic  activity,  resulting  in  income  generation,  employment,  and \nrehabilitation of affected people. Health and educational facilities will provide fundamental social services that are needed \nto rebuild the human capital that was lost. \nThe legal assistance, governance, and institutional building component will provide relief to the legal and documentary \nproblems that earthquake-affected people will encounter. Major targets will be the issue or replacement of identity cards \nand birth, death, and marriage certificates. The component will also provide a legal framework with special provisions for \npeople and property affected by the earthquake, especially vulnerable people. \nFinally, the use of labor-intensive techniques in the civil works will provide job opportunities in all affected areas. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                          Proposed Classification:      Poverty intervention\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPrior to the earthquake, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) were not the poorest \nregions in the country. They were nevertheless among the most vulnerable to external shocks. Geographical isolation, the \nharshness and fragmentation of the land, the lack of security as a consequence of conflicts, and adverse climatic \nconditions put the population at risk of being thrown into poverty. \nThe earthquake claimed some 80,000 lives, almost half of whom are thought to be children, and some 70,000 were \ninjured, and 2.8 million were left without shelter. Of the 70,000 who were injured, many will be permanently disabled. \nMany of the affected people will also need counseling. Crops and other livelihood assets were destroyed, and savings \nwere lost. Many communities are completely isolated, and they are particularly threatened by epidemic diseases, famine, \nand cold. Productive human capital was deeply compromised, as was the productive capacity of the affected region as a \nwhole. Risks of abuse, discrimination, and militia recruitment are very high. \nThe earthquake had impacts in the short and the long term. In the short term, the lack of food and shelter threatens the \nsurvival of affected people. In the long term, productive capacity is threatened in that many men died, leaving women who \nwill have to enter the labor market, many for the first time. Disabilities will constitute a great burden on affected families \nand the Government.  \nA mass of new poor will have to first go through the harshness of winter and then find their way out of poverty. \nBefore the earthquake, both NWFP and AJK had relatively few people living on less than $1 per day\u20149.9% in NWFP and \n2.5% in AJK, against a national average of 13.9%. Yet poverty was substantial when including those living on $2 per \nday\u201476.2% in NWFP and 51.0% in AJK, against a national average of 69.7%. Hence the extreme vulnerability. \nC.  Participation Process\nStakeholder Analysis: No\nParticipation Strategy:  Yes \nAll stakeholders will be actively involved in order to reduce the risk of grievance and ensure that benefits are fairly \ndistributed. High rates of participation are also proven to increase ownership. In addition, contractors will discuss the \nselection of unskilled labor in the project area with township labor officials and village leaders to ensure that labor will be\nhired on a nondiscriminatory basis.

Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women \nWomen traditionally suffer discriminated in Pakistan and, in the aftermath of the earthquake, face the burden of providing \nfor their families. Disabilities place additional burdens on women and other family members. Family and household \nstructures may need to be recast, with many families forming one household, other households headed by one person \n(female or male), and other families composed of grandparents and grandchildren. Widows will embrace the role of head \nof household, combining the traditional roles of breadwinner and caregiver. \nVocational training will be essential, as will special rehabilitation and training for disabled women. Equal opportunities and \naccess to jobs will be crucial. Equal property rights and proper identification are also very important.

The objective of the proposed Project is to support the efforts of the Government of \nPakistan (the Government) to rehabilitate areas affected by the recent earthquake in northern \nPakistan, especially in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and North-West Frontier Province \n(NWFP). The Project will employ a sector loan modality to allow the selection of the highest \npriority  subprojects  during  implementation.  Based  on  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment, the Project will cover the following sectors: transport, energy, and the social sector \nareas  of  health  and  education.  Due  to  the  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  sample \nsubproject has been selected, so no sample subproject initial environmental examination (IEE) \nis available.  \n2.  The  Project\u2019s  IEE  provides  overall  preliminary  scoping  and  highlights  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  to  be  further  explored  during  subproject \nformulation. The Project\u2019s IEE includes an environmental assessment and review framework \nthat provides a set of guidelines on how the environmental assessment for the subprojects will \nbe  prepared  and  reviewed.  This  IEE  was  based  on  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment and the environmental and social screening framework prepared by the World \nBank.\nB.   Overview of the Project \n3.  The  Project  aims  to  support  reconstruction  and  recovery  from  the  affects  of  the \nearthquake with particular focus on (i) reconstructing basic infrastructure and services and (ii) \nreviving economic activity in the affected areas. The Project has three sector components. The \nscope of the proposed project components is summarized in Table A14.1. \nTable A14.1: The Summary of the Scope of Project Components \nProject Component  Scope of Works \nTransport Sector  (cid:120)  Remove landslide debris and open roads to traffic \n(cid:120)  Restore roads and bridges \n(cid:120)  Stabilize road embankments to withstand snow \n(cid:120)  Comprehensively survey to guide planning and prioritization of the \nreconstruction and recovery works \n(cid:120)  Reconstruct unpaved local roads \n(cid:120)  Reconstruct the main provincial access roads \nEnergy Sector  (cid:120)  Procure on an emergency basis high- and low-voltage lines, \ntransformers, grid station equipment, and materials for power station \noperational buildings and staff quarters \n(cid:120)  Electrify the 10 tent villages and supply power \n(cid:120)  Repair and reconstruct on an emergency basis damaged electricity \nnetworks and related buildings \n(cid:120)  Upgrade and expand power systems to improve access for the poor \nand provide electricity to promote economic development in the \nearthquake-affected area \nSocial Sector: Health  (cid:120)  Reestablish public health centers \n(cid:120)  Provide services to people living in relief camps and disabled people \n(cid:120)  Reconstruct, repair, and provide equipment for health management \noffices and health facilities", "82 Appendix 14 \nProject Component  Scope of Works \nSocial Sector:  (cid:120)  Reconstruct and consolidate schools and resume classes \nEducation  immediately in semi-permanent structures \n(cid:120)  Survey and map where schools are needed and teachers are \navailable\n(cid:120)  Reconstruct and repair schools   \nC.   Description of the Environment \n4.  The project components will be located in earthquake-affected areas of AJK and NWFP. \nThe general environmental conditions are as follows:  \n5.  Physical Environment. The Project area is part of the mountainous region in the north, \nin which summers are temperate and winters intensely cold. Rainfall generally occurs in two \ndistinct crop-growing seasons, from December to March and from June to September, with the \nonset of the summer monsoon in the first or second week of June. In the intervening periods of \nApril-May and October-November, almost no rain falls. The three main rivers in the project area \nare the Jhelum, Kunhar, and Neelum.  \n6.  Ecological Environment. The Project area is located in the Himalayan Mountains and \nis  famous  for  its  high-altitude  coniferous  and  broad-leaved  forests  and  great  biodiversity. \nForests,  game  reserves,  and  cold  rivers,  lakes,  and  wetlands  characterize  the  landscape. \nAround 4% of the land in AJK has been declared protected forest. The Machiara National Park \nis located in the heart of the earthquake-affected area. In NWFP, about 6% of the land is \ndesignated as protected, with Ayubia National Park located at the periphery of the earthquake-\naffected zone.   \n7.  Social, Cultural, and Economic Development. The area most heavily damaged by \nearthquake is home to a scattered population of some 5.7 million people. The social structure in \nthis region is closely knit, with an average of 7 family members per household. About 88% of the \npeople live in the mountains in rural settlements ranging from two households to more than 300. \nThe region\u2019s population is relatively young, with 42% below the age of 15 years and only 6.7% \nabove the age of 60. A high portion of the population lacks basic services, clean drinking water, \nand  safe  waste  disposal.  Agriculture  and  livestock  rearing  are  the  primary  sources  of \nemployment in the rural areas, with most rural residents engaged in subsistence agriculture. \nPublic administration accounts for a significant proportion of employment in the affected urban \nareas, followed by small trading, business, construction, and transport.  \nD.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts  \n8.  The Project\u2019s main objective is to reconstruct and restore infrastructure damaged or \ndestroyed  by  the  earthquake  and  is  therefore  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. What adverse environmental impacts there may be will mostly be limited \nto the construction stage. They will affect a limited area only over the short term and be \nreversible, so the mitigation measures indicated in the attached matrix should be manageable. \n9.  To address any potential impacts, subprojects will be screened and classified at an early \nstage, and an environmental assessment will be carried out. The environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  will  guide  the  preparation  of  the  environmental  assessments  of \nsubprojects.  The  scoping  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  and  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures are presented in Table A14.2. ", "Appendix 14          8  3                              \n 10.  The  preliminary  damage  and  needs  assessment  indicates  that  the  following  post-\nearthquake environmental conditions require consideration:  \n(i)  Debris and rubble need to be removed before reconstruction can start. There \nwas evidence of debris and rubble being dumped in rivers adjacent to the cities \nand along the road, as well as in open fields, drainage ditches, and forested \nareas. These practices should be stopped, and the areas restored. Dumping in \nrivers affects the water quality and causes clogging and flooding, and dumping in \nthe forest destroys new vegetation. It is necessary to identify safe locations for \ndisposing of debris and rubble. \n(ii)  Petroleum  leakage  has  been  a  serious  environmental  problem  since  the \nearthquake.  It  is  estimated  that  around  10,000  liters  of  petroleum  fuel  in \nunderground  storage  have  leaked  due  to  earthquake  damage.  As  water  for \ndrinking  and  irrigation  come  mainly  from  surface  sources,  it  is  therefore \nnecessary to undertake monitoring of surface water contamination. \n(iii)  Landslides are the main environmental impact of this natural disaster. Landslides \naffect not only slope drainage, but also the habitats of fauna and flora. All project \ncomponents with significant physical intervention in landslide areas need to be \nproperly prepared by taking this into account. \nE.  Institutional Arrangement and Monitoring Plan (Environmental Assessment and \nReview Framework) \n11.  The  Project  will  be  executed  by  using  sector  modality  and  the  environmental \nassessment  framework,  which  covers  environmental  criteria  for  project  selection  and \nresponsibilities of the parties involve are summarized as follows:    \n1.  Environmental Criteria for Selection of Subprojects  \n12.  As much as possible, not to include a category A project in accordance to the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  (2003)  for  the  first \nbatch of the Project. If an environmental category A subproject needs to be included, the \nsummary environmental impact assessment (EIA) of this particular subproject will need to be \nprepared and be disclosed to the public 120 days prior the approval of the subproject. The EIA \nshould be carried out in accordance with ADB and Government of Pakistan requirements. In \naddition, a two-step staff consultations with affected people needs to be carried out. \n2.  Environmental Assessment Requirement \n13.  Taking into account the potential impacts related with the follow up subprojects, the \nGovernment of Pakistan notification on Environmental Impact Assessment Requirement, and \nthe  ADB  environmental  assessment  guidelines,  the  environmental  classification  of  the \nsubprojects will be as follows:  \n(i)  Subprojects will be categorized A if the subproject generates significant adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  that  requires  a  complex  management  plan,  or  if  the \nsubproject located within or pass through: (a) wildlife sanctuaries, (b) national \nparks, (c) other sanctuaries, (d) areas declared by the Government of Pakistan \nas  environmentally  sensitive,  (e)  areas  of  international  significance  (e.g., \nprotected  wetland  as  designated  by  the  Ramsar  Convention),  or  (f)  areas \ndesignated  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) as cultural heritage sites. This type of project requires \nEIA report including an environmental management plan (EMP). ", "84 Appendix 14 \n(ii)  A subproject will be categorized as B if the project is likely to have an adverse \nenvironmental  impact,  but  of  lesser  degree  or  significance  than  those  for \ncategory A subprojects and all the mitigation measures to handle the impact are \nmanageable. This type of project will need IEE report including EMP.  \n3.  Review  Procedure  for  Environmental  Assessment  of  Subprojects  and \nResponsibilities and Authorities\n14.  The  environmental  assessment  study  for  the  follow  up  subprojects  and  the  review \nprocedure for the follow up subproject will be carried out to comply with the Government\u2019s and \nADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies. The study will also identify mitigation measures.  \n15.  Each implementing agency will assume the following responsibilities: \n(i)  Hiring  the  qualified  environmental  consultant  to  prepare  the  environmental \nscreening to classify the subprojects in consultation with respective Provincial \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) either AJK EPA or NWFP EPA. \n(ii)  Conducting environmental assessment study based on the classification of the \nsub  project  with  adequate  consultation  with affected  people.  For  category  A \nsubproject two step consultation with affected people needs to be carried out. \n(iii)  For category B project, each implementing agency responsible for submitting the \nenvironmental screening and environmental assessment report and its summary \nto the AJK EPA or NWFP EPA for review in order to obtain an environmental \nclearance for execution of the subprojects. However, if the EPA AJK is not \navailable, the environmental clearance from PEPA should be obtained. \n(iv)  For  category  A  project,  aside  following  the  procedure  as  stated  in \n(ii),implementing agency needs to submit also the EIA report and its summary to \nADB  as  soon  as  possible  to  meet  the  120  days  public  disclosure  prior  to \nobtaining an ADB\u2019s approval for this subproject.   \n(v)  Forwarding the environmental clearance and its conditions to ADB. \n(vi)  Ensuring that the contract document for implementing each subproject includes: \n(a)  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan  taken  from  the \nenvironmental assessment report, and (b) the environmental clearance certificate \nand its conditions.  \n(vii)  Ensuring that environmental clearance certificate from NWFP EPA or AJK EPA \nshould be obtained prior to granting contract award.   \n(viii)  Monitoring the implementation of environmental management plan throughout \nthe whole project implementation stage particularly during preparation of detail \nengineering design and construction stage and preparing the report in monitoring \nthe implementation of environmental management plan.  \n(ix)  Undertaking remedial action in close consultation with respective EPA and ADB \nto handle unexpected environmental impacts.  \n(x)  Submitting the monitoring report on EMP to the relevant agencies and ADB. \n16.  ADB will assume the following responsibility: \n(i)  Providing comments for the preparation of the EIA and its summary of any \nsubproject that categorized as A project.  \n(ii)  Disclosing the SEIA report for category A subproject through ADB\u2019s website 120 \ndays prior to approving subproject. \n(iii)  Approving  subproject  by  taking  into  account  the  environmental  assessment \nreport and conditions of environmental clearance certificates.  \n(iv)  Undertaking  random  monitoring  in  the  implementation  the  environmental \nsafeguard policy at any time within the implementation period of the Project. ", "Appendix 14          8  5                              \n(v)  Providing  suggestion  and  recommendations  on  remedial  actions  to  handle \nunexpected environmental impacts.  \n4.  Environmental  Due  Diligence  to  Ensure  Compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Policy \n17.  The Government should ensure that ADB is given access to undertake environmental \nmonitoring for all subprojects, if needed. However, the line department where the subprojects is \nimplemented  has  the  responsibility  for  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  environmental \nmanagement plan for its respective subprojects. The report on monitoring the implementation of \nEMP needs to be systematically documented.   \n5.  Public Disclosure \n18.  Each  implementing  agency  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental \nassessment documentation, including the monitoring reports, is properly and systematically kept \nas part of the subproject-specific records. \n19.  All  environmental  assessment  documents  are  subject  to  public  disclosure  and \ndocuments must be made available to public, if requested. \n6.  Staff Requirement and Budget \n20.  Each implementing agency at present has no environmental officer, therefore, it has \nbeen  included  in  the  project  implementation  arrangement  that  each  implementing  agency \n(where  required)  and  both  reconstruction  agencies  will  be  supported  with  a  qualified \nenvironmental consultant. \nF.    Public Consultation and Disclosure \n21.  Consultation with affected people was not specifically done during the preparation of this \nsummary IEE due to the emergency nature of the Project. However, the Government and other \ndonors were closely involved in the preliminary damage and need assessment, which is the \nbasis  for  preparing  this  summary.  In  addition,  during  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment and the Fact-Finding Mission, the proposed environmental assessment and review \nframework was discussed, and agreement was reached that it will be implemented for the \nsubprojects.  Therefore,  during  subproject  preparation,  especially  when  the  environmental \nassessment is being prepared, consultation with concerned parties will be conducted to comply \nwith the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s requirements.\nG.  Findings and Recommendation \n22.  The  Project  and  its  subprojects  will  focus  on  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating \ninfrastructure. Therefore, it is expected that an adverse environmental impact will mostly occur \nduring  the construction  phase.  These  impacts  are  insignificant,  short  term,  and  reversible. \nMitigation measures should be integrated into the engineering and construction works as part of \nsubproject design. However, it is necessary to ensure that subprojects meet the Government\u2019s \nand  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  requirements  prior to  their  approval  and  that  the \nenvironmental management plan for each subproject is strictly implemented.

89\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  proposed  project  will  support  the  efforts  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan  (the \nGovernment) in the recovery, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of the earthquake-affected areas \nof Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).  \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  assist  the  rehabilitation  of  damaged  or \ndestroyed infrastructure of the transport, power, and health and education sectors, and will \nprovide legal assistance and support for institutional building. Reconstruction and rehabilitation \nof damaged or destroyed facilities will be done at their original sites. The Government will try to \nuse its own land if additional land is required for physical infrastructure. The Government will \nacquire private land only if vacant government-owned land is not available  \n3.  Resettlement  impacts1 of  a  specific  subproject  will  be  known  only  during  project \nimplementation. As a result, the preparation of resettlement plans for such subprojects cannot \nbe  done  before  Board  consideration  of  the  loan  and  grant.  Therefore  the  resettlement \nframework  will  be  part  of  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  and  the  legal \nagreements considered by the Board at project approval. This resettlement framework, agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB, sets out compensation and other entitlements of all project-\naffected people as well as how to prepare satisfactory resettlement plans for subprojects with \nresettlement impacts.\n4.  Among the earthquake-affected communities are several dominant tribes and subtribes \nthat participate in mainstream economic and political activities and are represented in public \ninstitutions, civil services, and educational institutions. Social inequalities and vulnerabilities in \nthese communities usually arise from economic differentiation, as land is owned by a few large, \npowerful families who rent it out to others who cultivate crops and raise livestock. The project is \nunlikely to change this dominant mode of economic system. A social assessment2 will be \nconducted focusing on the vulnerabilities of all affected groups including tribal groups and \ncultural minorities in the earthquake-affected areas. This is to ensure effective consultations and \nthat culturally appropriate benefits will reach each affected group. As part of this assessment, \nthe executing agency of each subproject will examine the vulnerability of different groups in \nterms of potential exclusion from subproject benefits, negative subproject impacts, and the need \nfor  specific  culturally  compatible  mechanisms  for  participation  by  women,  the  permanently \ndisabled, and other vulnerable groups. If any of the above are found in a subproject area, the \nexecuting agency will incorporate adequate measures to address such vulnerabilities in project \ndesign.  If  land  acquisition  or  relocation  becomes  necessary,  people\u2019s  entitlements  will  be \nensured through the resettlement plan that will be prepared in accordance with the approved \nresettlement framework.\nB.  Policy and Legal Framework  \n5.  The resettlement framework has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (IRP),  its  disaster  and  emergency  assistance  policy,  and  the  Land \n                                                \n1  Resettlement impacts are social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary, and are caused by (i) \nacquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on land as a \nresult of an ADB operation. \n2  The World Bank has planned to conduct a similar social assessment in the affected areas. ADB and World Bank \ncould jointly conduct this assessment. ", "90 Appendix 15 \nAcquisition Act (LAA) of 1894 (with amendments).3 Whereas the LAA considers those eligible \nfor compensation to be legal owners and tenants who are registered with the Land Revenue \nDepartment or possess formal lease agreements, the IRP emphasizes that the absence of \nformal legal title to land is not a bar to entitlements and assistance. The second important policy \nissue is that, while the LAA assesses compensation based on the market value of acquired \nproperty, the IRP emphasizes the payment of replacement value of all affected assets. The third \npolicy issue is the participatory approach to grievance resolution provided by the IRP through \ninformation  disclosure  and  discussions  with  affected  communities,  and  the  appointment  of \nspecial committees such as grievance redress committees. In contrast, under the LAA, the sole \nauthority to resolve disputes lies with the Land Acquisition Collector. Thus the IRP provides for \nconsultation and disclosure of resettlement information much more than does the LAA. The IRP \nemphasizes of rehabilitation of all affected people so that they will not be worse off because of \nland acquisition and resettlement. The LAA does not provide such assistance but does declare \na land owner eligible for a 15% acquisition surcharge and 8% compounded interest per year if \ncompensation payment is delayed.  \n6.  Having taken into consideration the above differences between the LAA and IRP, the \nfollowing  resettlement  policy  principles  were  adopted  for  the  purpose  of  the  Project.  If  a \nsubproject requires land acquisition or resettlement or both, the executing agency will prepare a \nsatisfactory resettlement plan based on the following core principles and will obtain ADB\u2019s \napproval prior to awarding contracts.\n7.  The main involuntary resettlement principles and procedures that are applicable to the \nProject are the following:  \n(i)  Involuntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided;  if  it  cannot  be  avoided,  it  will  be \nminimized.\n(ii)  Where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, affected persons will be assisted \nin reestablishing themselves and improving their quality of life. \n(iii)  Lack of formal legal land title is not a bar to compensation or rehabilitation \nassistance under the Project.  \n(iv)  Land-for-land is an option for compensation in the case of loss of land; however, \nin the absence of replacement land, cash compensation for the property acquired \nwill be paid at its replacement value4 in addition to any transaction costs.  \n(v)  Each affected person is entitled to receive assistance to restore income and \nlivelihood  to  a  pre-project  standard,  and  all  vulnerable  affected  people  are \nentitled to assistance to improve their income and livelihood.  \n(vi)  All affected people will be fully informed and consulted on compensation and \nother  entitlements,  relocation  programs,  and  rehabilitation  assistance.  The \nresettlement plan will be posted on the ADB website. \n(vii)  Affected people will be fully involved in the selection of relocation sites, if any, \nand livelihood compensation and development options at the earliest opportunity.  \n                                                \n3  The draft resettlement policy and associate ordinance was prepared with ADB\u2019s assistance in 2002. These \ninstruments have still not been approved by the Government. \n4  Replacement cost means the cost of replacing lost assets and income. In the case of land, it means the cost of \nbuying replacement land near the lost land with equal productive potential plus the cost of preparing the land to \nlevels similar to those of the affected land and the cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If alternative land is \nnot available in the vicinity of the lost land, it means the cost of buying land with similar attributes and productive \nand/or residential potential plus the cost of preparing the land to levels similar to those of the affected land and cost \nof any registration and transfer taxes. In selecting alternative lands, affected people will be informed and consulted.

Procedure of Formulating a Resettlement Plan  \n9.  Subprojects will be selected based on several selection criteria agreed upon by the \nGovernment and ADB. The executing agency of a subproject will do its best to avoid or at least \nto minimize land acquisition and resettlement as much as possible. If resettlement impacts are \nunavoidable in implementing a subproject, the executing or implementing agency will formulate \na resettlement plan for the subproject by following the procedure given below: \n(i)  Initially categorize anticipated resettlement impacts in consultation with the ADB \nPakistan  Resident  Mission  and  identify  the  financial  and  expert  resources \nrequired to prepare a resettlement plan if resettlement impacts are identified. \n(ii)  Conduct stakeholder consultations to obtain their inputs regarding how to avoid \nor at least minimize involuntary resettlement, and to identify their needs and \npreferences; undertake a social assessment to identify different categories of \naffected people, including indigenous peoples, based on the degree and scale of \nsubproject impacts on them.  \n(iii)  Outline  an  applicable  policy  and  legal  framework  (if  the  policy  and  legal \nframework discussed in the resettlement framework are adequate to address \nresettlement  impacts,  only  a  summary  of  the  policy  and  legal  framework  is \nrequired, along with a reference to the resettlement framework). \n(iv)  Undertake a census and complete an asset inventory of all affected people and \nhouseholds, and provide resettlement information to all affected people in their \nown language. \n(v)  Develop an entitlements matrix to outline the entitlements of all affected people \nincluding  non-titled  people  (e.g.,  squatters,  encroachers,  tenants,  and  wage \nworkers) following the above entitlement matrix (if new categories of affected \npeople  and  types  of  losses  are  identified  during  project  implementation, \nappropriate entitlements will be added to the resettlement plan and forwarded to \nADB for review and approval, and all affected people should be informed of such \nchanges).\n(vi)  Explain  relocation  plans  and  the  rehabilitation  strategy,  including  income \nrestoration and improvement, to affected people.\n(vii)  Describe the institutional framework of resettlement programs.\n(viii)  Itemize a budget for all resettlement activities in the resettlement budget and \nfinancial plan.\n(ix)  Outline, if applicable, the environmental impacts of relocation.\n(x)  Formulate a time-bound schedule for resettlement plan implementation. \n(xi)  Outline procedures contained in the grievance redress mechanism. \n(xii)  Describe  both  the  internal  and  external  monitoring  program  and  the  final \nevaluation.\n(xiii)  Disclose the draft resettlement plan to all affected people in their own language \nand keep copies of the documents at public offices; the executing agency will \nendorse it before submitting it to ADB for review and approval. \n(xiv)  Disclose the resettlement plan to all affected people again after ADB\u2019s approval,  \nif it is revised according to ADB\u2019s advice and comments (the plan will be posted \non ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement website). \n(xv)  At a minimum, pay compensation and complete any required relocation before \nawarding subproject construction contracts.  ", "Appendix 15  95\nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  The  resettlement  specialists  of  the  safeguard  compliance  group  within  the  project \ncoordination unit will ensure that the each project implementing agency formulates satisfactory \nresettlement  plans  for  each  subproject  with  any  resettlement  impacts.  Each  implementing \nagency  will  have  resettlement  specialists  among  its  consultants  who  will  assist  each \nadministrative  department  or  implementing  agency  with  initial  screening  of  subprojects  for \nresettlement impacts. If any are found, the resettlement specialists will assist in undertaking \nsocial assessments at subproject sites and in formulating resettlement plans, were necessary, \nin accordance with the approved resettlement framework. If significant resettlement impacts are \nidentified, the line department or implementing agency is responsible for engaging resettlement \nspecialists  to  ensure  resettlement  safeguard  compliance  and  for  submitting  satisfactory \nresettlement plans to the implementing agency and ADB for review and approval prior to any \nacquisition or resettlement of affected persons and the award of civil works contracts.\nF.  Consultation and Participation \n11.  Executing  agencies  will  invite  vulnerable  households  and  people  for  stakeholder \nconsultations during the formulation of resettlement plans. The decisions of such meetings will \nbe recorded, and these records will indicate the responsibility and timeline for implementing the \ndecisions. Each resettlement plan will include a note on all public consultations held and the \ndisclosure  of  resettlement  information.  During  resettlement  plan  preparation,  resettlement \ninformation will be disclosed to all affected people in their own language, and their views and \nopinions will be taken into consideration in finalizing the plans. Final resettlement plans will be \ntranslated into local languages and disclosed through public notices posted at implementing \nagency offices, published in newspapers, and posted on ADB\u2019s website. Affected people will be \nclosely consulted in resettlement site selection and livelihood restoration.  \nG.  Eligibility Provisions \n12.  All affected people are entitled to compensation and rehabilitation. However, eligibility to \nreceive compensation and other assistance will be limited by a cut-off date to be set for each \nsubproject on the day corresponding to the beginning of its preliminary impacts assessment. \nThe cut-off date defines \u201celigibility\u201d and \u201caffected person.\u201d  Given the destruction caused by the \nearthquake, some affected people may have difficulty proving their ownership of, or user rights \nto, any affected property. In such cases, affected people will be assisted and supported under \nthe legal assistance, governance and institutional building activities of the Project. Such support \nwill include reissuing and replacing national identity cards, property titles, birth certificates, \ndisability certificates, and marriage certificates. \nH.  Grievance Redress Mechanism \n13.  The LAA provides for aggrieved persons at different stages of land acquisition to present \ntheir grievances to the Land Acquisition Collector or a court of law for redress. The executing \nagency  of  each  subproject  with  resettlement  impacts  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \ncommittee headed by the district land acquisition collector and including among its members \nconcerned  union  councils,  local  nongovernment  and  community-based  organizations,  and \ncommunity leaders. The committees will be open forums for raising objections and holding \ndiscussions to resolve conflicts. Each committee will record its deliberations and inform the \nconcerned parties within 4 weeks of its findings and recommendations. ", "96 Appendix 15 \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n14.  SCs,  assisted  by  RAs  will  monitor  compliance  of  resettlement  plans  with  ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguard requirements in subproject design. It will also develop a \ntracking system to ensure that necessary resettlement plans are formulated, and submitted to \nADB for review and approval.  \n15.  Each resettlement plan will include monitoring\u2014internal and external\u2014indicators. The \nEA will conduct its own internal monitoring of RP implementation and will submit quarterly \nreports  to  SC.  A  private  firm,  NGO,  or  university  will  be  engaged  by  executing \nagency/implementing  agency  as  an  external  monitor.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted quarterly during the first year of subproject implementation, and twice a year from the \nsecond year to SC. SC will submit these reports to ERRA and ADB for review. There will be a \nseparate  section  in  the  project\u2019s  midterm  review  report  on  the  progress  in  resettlement \nimplementation in the entire project.  \nJ.  Resettlement Budget \n16.  The ERRA will be responsible for providing adequate funds for land acquisition and \nrelocation  arising  from  subprojects.  Detailed  estimates  will  be  prepared  by  executing \nagency/implementing agency for each RP, which will be included in the overall subproject \nestimate. The budget will include (i) detailed costs of land acquisition, relocation, and livelihood \nand income restoration and improvement; (ii) sources and availability of adequate funding; (iii) \narrangements for approval of RP cost estimates; and (iv) the flow of funds and contingency \narrangements.  \n17.  Land acquisition and resettlement are state government\u2019s responsibility. However, under \nthe Project, state governments might find difficult to pay for land acquisition and resettlement. \nTherefore, in each subproject, it is necessary to indicate who will fund land acquisition and \nresettlement costs. Costs of physical infrastructure at relocation sites and income and livelihood \nrestoration  and  improvement  programs  could  be  financed  from  grant  funds  provided  such \nfinancing has in-built check and balances to ensure ADB\u2019s requirements are met. All land \nacquisition,  compensation,  relocation  and  rehabilitation  of  income  and  livelihood  will  be \nconsidered as an integral component of project costs.  ", "Appendix 16  97\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The earthquake in northern Pakistan has disrupted lives of 1.6 to 2.2 million women and \nchildren. Already considered particularly vulnerable, they have now lost homes, assets, and \nfamily members, becoming widows or orphans. Many of those who survived are injured, and \nsome are permanently disabled physically and/or psychologically even as they are left without a \nsupport network. Many are at risk due to cold, malnutrition, disease, and a lack of access to \nresources  and  assets  to  address  their  situation.  Most  were  never  registered  and  lack  the \nidentification  documents  they  need  to  reclaim  their  properties  or  inherit  them  from  family \nmembers the have lost.  \n2.  Women and children in these precarious conditions are also at risk of physical and/or \npsychological abuse and violence and progressive marginalization. In addition, children are at \nrisk, especially in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), of being recruited by militias to escape \nextreme poverty and famine. \nB.  The Gender Action Plan \n3.  The objectives of the gender action plan (GAP) are to promote and enable the equal \nparticipation of men and women stakeholders as agents and beneficiaries of the Pakistan \nEarthquake Emergency Assistance Project (the Project). The GAP is based on analyses of \ngender disparity and the gender dimension of poverty in Pakistan. In Pakistan, women are \nparticularly disadvantaged, suffering discrimination in the social, cultural, economic, and political \nspheres of life and denied equal access to resources, services, and opportunities that will \nenable them to participate in, contribute to, and benefit fully from development processes in the \ncountry. Women have different legal status from men. For these reasons women are particularly \nvulnerable, especially in the aftermath of a catastrophic event such as the earthquake. The \nProject  will  encourage  and  support  women\u2019s  increased  participation  in  the  consultative \nprocesses of planning and implementing the various activities to be carried out within the \ndifferent sectors through the loan project components of the Project. In addition, the GAP will \ndevelop measures to mitigate the risks deriving from the situation. The Project includes legal \nassistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building  activities.  This  GAP  will  guide  the \ndevelopment of provisions under this component with particular attention to women. The GAP \nwill pay particular attention to the following: \n(i)  equal participation of women in reconstruction planning; \n(ii)  recovery of livelihood and economic activity for women, especially those who \nhave become household heads; \n(iii)  equal  access  for  women  and  men  to  infrastructure  activities  in  relation  to \nplanning, construction, maintenance, and as users; \n(iv)  equal  compensation  to  women  for  land  acquisition  under  the  Project\u2019s \ncomponents; and \n(v)  equal wages for female workers in reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.

", "Appendix 17  101\nVULNERABLE PEOPLE ACTION PLAN \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The earthquake-affected areas of Pakistan were not the poorest in the country, but they \nwere among the most vulnerable. Years of conflict in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and \nneighboring Afghanistan, geographical remoteness, and climatic harshness have made these \nareas particularly vulnerable.\n2.  The earthquake exacerbated the plight of the existing marginalized groups while creating \nnew ones. Both existing and newly marginalized groups may not be able to access assistance \non an equal basis. In particular, female-headed households, widows, and orphaned children are \nat risk of having little or no access to supplies and services and of losing property claims, often \nbecause they lack proper identification. The elderly and the disabled are likely to have lost their \nsupport network, notably family members. Physical and psychological disabilities caused by the \nearthquake need to be taken into account, as they carry long-term effects in terms of economic \ncosts and social exclusion. Long-term health expenses and rehabilitation will be important \nburdens for families and the Government alike. \nB.  The Action Plan \n3.  The empowerment of those affected by the earthquake needs to be integrated into all \nproject interventions. The need to (i) protect the vulnerable from exploitation, violence, and \nabuse; (ii)  ensure their access to entitlements and assets; and (iii) ensure the inclusion of the \ndisabled in education, vocational training, and employment schemes are guiding principles that \nneed  to  be  communicated  to  policymakers,  public  servants,  camp  managers,  the  media, \nnongovernment organizations, and affected and displaced people themselves. These actions \nneed to be implemented using a rights-based approach, with institutional building activities \nlegally supporting such changes. \n4.  The objectives of this action plan are to promote and enable the equal participation of \nvulnerable stakeholders as agents and beneficiaries of the Pakistan Earthquake Emergency \nAssistance Project (the Project). These groups are particularly disadvantaged and discriminated \nagainst in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres of life, and are denied equal \naccess to resources, services, social and official structures, and opportunities that will enable \nthem to participate in, contribute to, and fully benefit from development processes in the country. \nThe  Project  will  encourage  and  support  vulnerable  people\u2019s  increased  participation  in  the \nconsultative processes of planning and implementing the various activities to be carried out in \nthe loan components of the Project. In addition, the action plan will develop measures to \nmitigate the risks arising from the post-earthquake situation. This action plan will guide the \ndevelopment of provisions under the legal assistance, governance, and institutional building \ncomponent with particular attention to all vulnerable groups. The action plan will focus particular \nattention on the following: \n(i)  equal participation of all vulnerable people in reconstruction planning; \n(ii)  recovery of livelihood and economic activity for the vulnerable, particularly the \ndisabled and those who have lost their support networks; \n(iii)  equal  access  for  vulnerable  groups  to  infrastructure  activities  in  relation  to \nplanning and, where possible, construction, use, and maintenance; \n(iv)  equal compensation to vulnerable people for land acquired under the project \ncomponents; and ", "102 Appendix 17 \n(v)  equal  wages  for  workers  from  vulnerable  groups  in  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation activities. \n5.  Vulnerable people include the following: \n(i)  female-headed households (also covered by the GAP); \n(ii)  widows (also covered by the GAP); \n(iii)  orphaned children;  \n(iv)  the elderly, especially those who have lost their support network; \n(v)  the physically and/or psychologically disabled, especially those who have lost \ntheir support network;  \n(vi)  ethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities; \n(vii)  nomadic tribes in the effected areas; \n(viii)  people living in extreme poverty; and \n(ix)  internally displaced people, particularly minors. \nTable A17: Vulnerable People Action Plan \nComponent  Target actions \n1.

Background \n1.  With  reference  to  accounting  and  audit,  each  executing  agency  and  implementing \nagency will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify works, goods, and services \nfinanced  by  the  loan  proceeds.  Specifically,  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation \nAuthority  (ERRA)  and  each  executing  agency/implementing  agency  will  maintain  separate \naccounts for the Project and ensure project accounts are audited annually and submitted to \nADB. Given the relatively high degree of fiduciary risk associated with this Project, the audited \naccounts and financial statements will be provided to ADB within 4 months of the end of the \nfiscal  year.  The  auditing  requirement  has  been  harmonized  with  that  of  the  World  Bank. \nAlthough both institutions typically required submission of audited financial statements within 6 \nmonths, it was felt that the risks associated with this transaction together with a 36-month \nimplementation period warranted a slightly tighter deadline for submission. \n2.  The Ministry of Finance, Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) and Controller General of \nAccounts (CGA) are working with ERRA, as the client for services of the AGP and CGA, to \ndevelop  and  institutionalise  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  including \naccounting systems that will produce auditable accounts and financial and performance auditing \narrangements governing all resources for post-quake rehabilitation and reconstruction. This \ninvolves revising existing government systems and procedures to address the specific scope, \nscale and timing requirements of the earthquake response. With regard to accounts, the CGA \nwill approve the accounting system, including financial management. ERRA and implementing \nagencies will maintain accounts in accordance with the new accounting model (NAM). The \naccounts  will  be  computerized  providing  auditable  information  to  track  expenditure  by \nimplementing agency, donor, district, province/state and activity. ERRA will follow this model for \nits own accounts, and to aggregate implementing agencies\u2019 accounts.  \n3.  The  AGP  audit  jurisdiction  will  extend  to  all  agencies  involved  in  post-quake \nrehabilitation and reconstruction operations. The AGP will conduct an annual financial audit and \nperiodic compliance with authority and performance audits. The AGP carries out audits in \naccordance  with  the  International  Organisation  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  (INTOSAI) \nstandards. In order to meet the increased workload demands of these responsibilities the AGP \nis establishing a team of auditors headed by a Director General ERRA Audit with three offices in \nAbbottabad, Islamabad, and Muzaffarabad. The AGP is empowered to hire incremental staff as \nrequired.\n4  ERRA is developing an earthquake monitoring and evaluation framework based on five \ncore principles: (i) joint and harmonized monitoring and evaluation; (ii) results focus; (iii) lesson \nlearning; (iv) people focus; and (v) transparency and communication. ERRA will establish a \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  for  the  Earthquake  Emergency  Assistance \nProject  loan  and  grant  funded  activities  and  outcomes.  ERRA  will  need  to  ensure  that \nmonitoring and evaluation systems for earthquake recovery activities are coherent, provide \ninformation to enable timely preparation of reports for management and donors and ensure that \nimplementation lessons inform policy makers. ", "Appendix 18  105\nB.   Scope of Services \n5.  This TA has three components. \n1.  Auditable Accounts (Component 1) \n6.  This includes CGA support to ERRA to design and implement the financial management \nsystem consistent with the NAM through a packaged solution configured in software (SAP R3) \nconsistent with the on-going World Bank funded project to improve financial reporting and \nauditing (PIFRA). This will include computerization of the financial accounting and budgeting \nsystem at the point of expenditure. ERRA will be required to aggregate of financial reports from \nthree types of agencies receiving funds against approved schemes: (i) existing government \nimplementing agencies e.g. Frontier Works Organisation, National Housing Authority, Water and \nPower Development Authority, etc.; (ii) NGOs and other civil society organisations; and (iii) \nproposed province/state and district level \u2018reconstruction institutions\u2019. The CGA, ERRA and \nimplementing  agencies  will  require  targeted  technical  assistance  in  areas  such  as  system \ndesign and computerization of accounts, and training of over 150 officers. \n2.  Financial, Compliance and Performance Audits (Component 2) \n7.  This includes capacity development of the newly established DG Audit ERRA office \nwithin the AGP to ensure that timely and accurate audit reports are prepared. Technical support \nand  training  of  over  120  auditors  is  required  by  the  AGP  in  three  areas:  (i)  conducting \ninformation  systems  audit  including  updating  manuals  and  working  papers;  (ii)  instituting \nstrategic audit planning, monitoring and quality assurance systems including developing an \naudit plan, establishing a quality assurance cell and reviewing the process life cycle of audit \nreports; and (iii) developing guidelines for procurement audit including conducting procurement \naudit of sample large schemes and developing case studies and training in donor (ADB, World \nBank etc.) procurement procedures. A study tour for selected senior officials to visit a tsunami-\naffected country(s) to discuss audit and accounting responses is proposed. \n3.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (Component 3) \n8.  ERRA is developing an earthquake monitoring and evaluation framework. Technical \nassistance will be provided to ensure that the Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project loan \nand grant monitoring and evaluation system is integral to the broader ERRA framework and \nprovides timely information for ADB and government. \nC.   Staffing \n9.  A total of 192 person-months of domestic and 9 person-months of international, long and \nshort term, individual consultants are proposed. This includes 36 person-months for a domestic \nproject coordinator. Consultants will provide training and technical advice in various aspects of \naudit,  accounts  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  It  is  expected  that  domestic \nconsultants providing technical advice in audit and accounts will be drawn from the pool of ex-\nAGP and CGA officers.\nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n10.  The AGP and CGA will be the executing agencies for the TA. The proposed TA is \nscheduled  to  be  implemented  for  36  months  from  January  2006  to  January  2009.  ", "106 Appendix 18 \nAdministration of the proposed TA will be delegated to the ADB PRM. It is proposed to establish \nan advisory committee with representatives of AGP, CGA and ERRA chaired by ADB to (i) \nassist in short-listing, including provision of the Government\u2019s concurrence of consultants; (ii) \napprove progress and annual reports; and (iii) provide guidance to the team of consultants \nrecruited under the proposed TA. The Governance Unit, PRM will provide secretariat services to \nthe  advisory  committee.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of consultants. Procurement of equipment will be conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for procurement. \nE.   Reporting and Documentation Requirements \n11.  Biannual reports prepared by the Governance Unit secretariat will be endorsed by the \nadvisory committee prior to submission to the Government and ADB. \nF.   Government Inputs \n12.  The  AGP,  CGA  and  ERRA  will  provide  consultants  with  suitable  office  space  and \ncounterpart  staff,  local  communications,  office  support  staff  and  necessary  equipment  to \nconduct their mandated responsibilities. As noted above a new DG Audit ERRA wing of AGP is \nbeing established and ERRA will be fully staffed to address its accounting, internal audit and \nperformance monitoring and evaluation responsibilities. Government training venues will be \navailed as appropriate. \nG.   Cost Estimates \nTable A18: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem\nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
