An \n(Appendix 14). \n\ninitial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken \n\nProject\nDescription\n\nRationale\n\nThe  Earthquake  Emergency  Assistance  Project \n(the  Project)  will \nrehabilitate  and  restore  infrastructure  damaged  and  destroyed  by  the \nearthquake  of  8  October  2005  in  affected  areas  of  Azad  Jammu  and \nthereby \nKashmir  (AJK)  and  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP), \nrestoring  the  livelihoods  of  affected  people.  The  Project\u2019s  design  is  based \non the findings of the preliminary damage and needs assessment (PDNA), \nprepared  for  the  Government  by  a  multidonor  mission  led  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank  from  24  October  to  12 \nNovember 2005.  \n\nThe  investment  component  of  the  Project  is  designed  as  a  sector  project \nand  will  address  urgently  required  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  in  the \ntransport,  power,  and  health  and  education  sectors.  The  Project\u2019s  quick-\ndisbursing  component  will \nimports.  Local \ncommunities  and  beneficiaries  will  actively  participate  in  the  selection, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  all  works \ncarried out under the Project. The Project additionally addresses the needs \nof  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  children,  and  assists  affected \npeople  by  supporting  the  reissue  of  lost  identification  cards  and  other \ndocumentation, as well as protecting their legal rights. \n\nfinance  urgently  needed \n\nThe 8 October 2005 earthquake was the most debilitating natural disaster \nin  Pakistan\u2019s  history.  According  to  figures  provided  by  the  Government  of \nPakistan,  as  of  3  November  2005,  approximately  73,000  people  had  died \nand more than 70,000 were severely injured or disabled.  Over 2.8 million \npeople have been left without shelter, and 2.3 million persons are without \nadequate  food.  The  overall  cost  associated  with  the  earthquake  is \nestimated  at  $5.2  billion,  which  includes  the  costs  of  relief,  livelihood \nsupport  for  victims,  and  reconstruction.  The  cost  of  reconstructing  of  lost \nassets  and  restoring  services  is  estimated  to  be  $3.5  billion.  Estimates \nshow  the  total  loss  in  employment  to  be  around  324,000  jobs,  equal  to \nabout  29%  of  the  previously employed population in the affected districts \n\n\fii\n\n \n\nImpact and \nOutcome\n\nand  affecting  nearly  1.6  million  people.  Vulnerable  groups  are  at  risk  of \nbecoming  poorer.  In  particular,  female-headed  households,  widows,  and \norphaned children are at a risk of having little or no access to supplies and \nservices  and  of  losing  property  claims,  often  because  they  lack  proper \nidentity papers.  By providing   financing   for the most   urgently needed \ncomponents and works, the loan and grant will enable the Government to \nfinance  a  portion  of  the  overall  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  program, \nprovide assistance to vulnerable groups, and help to restore the economic \nactivity essential to the survival of residents in the heavily affected areas.   \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  reversing  the \ndevastating impact of the earthquake and so revive economic activity and \nenable people to resume their livelihoods and return to normal life. This will \nbe  achieved  primarily  through  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  damaged \nand  destroyed  infrastructure  as  quickly  as  possible,  which  will  particularly \nassist the poor and other vulnerable people. \n\nThe Project will have the following components:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nQuick-disbursing  component.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster\nand Emergency Assistance Policy, a portion of the proposed Project \nwill  be  used  for  quick-disbursing  assistance  to  partly  finance  the \nunusually  high  and  unexpected  expenditures \nfor \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  The  quick-disbursing  component \nwill be used to finance only those imports identified as necessary for \nan  effective  recovery  program.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed on a list of permissible imports for financing under the quick-\ndisbursing facility. \n\nrequired \n\nProject's sector components. In consultation with the Government, \nand  taking  into  account  the  assistance  being  proposed  by  other \ndevelopment partners, project components will finance rehabilitation \nand  reconstruction  in  the  following sectors:  (a) transport;  (b)  power; \nand  (c)  health  and  education.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and \nreconstruct  high-priority  earthquake-damaged  educational,  health \nand  road  infrastructure  facilities  by  providing  civil  works,  equipment \nand  materials.  These  activities  will  be  undertaken  with  the  adoption \nof  appropriate  and  cost-effective  earthquake-resistant  design  and \nconstruction  standards.  Civil  works  designs  will  follow  a  sector \napproach in selecting the highest-priority subprojects. This will allow \na quick response and maximum flexibility regarding both geographic \ncoverage  and  the  selection  of  subprojects,  within  an  agreed \nframework and criteria.  \n\n(iii) \n\nfor  project  design, \n\nImplementation  assistance.  Consulting  services  will \ninclude \nservices \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation.  Legal  assistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building \nsubcomponents  will  be  used  to  address  governance,  legal,  and \ndocumentary issues arising from the earthquake\u2019s impact. \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nCost Estimates  The  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $374.2  million  equivalent.  For  the \nProject\u2019s  sector  components,  the  Government  will  contribute  24%  of  the \nestimated  cost  of  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  mainly  in  the  form  of \ntaxes  and  duties, \nland  acquisition,  rehabilitation,  resettlement,  and \nadministrative  support.  As  a  sector  approach  is  being  followed,  the  cost \nestimates are broken down by sectors. \n\nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a grant of $80 million from the Pakistan Earthquake Fund, \nand a loan of $220 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources\u2014as Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) loan\u2014to finance the Project.  \n\nThis  covers  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  (except  interest  during \nimplementation)  of  $236.3  million,  as  well  as  $63.7  million  equivalent  of \nlocal currency cost. \n\nSource \n\nA.

In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  the \nloan  will  have  a  40-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  an \ninterest  rate  of  1%  per  annum,  and  repayment  of  principal  at  2%  per \nannum  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4%  per  annum \nthereafter.\n\nThe Government will make the loan and the grant proceeds of the Project \navailable  to  the  governments  of  AJK  and  NWFP  in  accordance  with  the \nexisting policies and practices of the Government or any changes approved \nby the  Government\u2019s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). Likewise, \na  portion  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to \nPeshawar Electricity Supply Company (PESCO) and Islamabad Electricity \nSupply  Company  (IESCO)  in  accordance  with  the  existing  policies  of  the \nGovernment  or  any  changes  approved  by  the  Government\u2019s  ECC.

The \nmechanisms  and  implementation  strategies,  institutional  framework  and \nrelated  terms  of  reference  for  the  recovery  efforts  under  the  umbrella  of \nERRA are still being developed. Based on current understanding of ERRA \nfunctions, the authority is expected to facilitate, guide, coordinate, approve \nand  monitor  the  reconstruction  effort,  develop  the  overall  policy  and \nplanning  framework  for  the  reconstruction  effort,  standard  setting  and \nquality  control  and  manage  the  operation  and  accounting  of  rehabilitation \nand  reconstruction  funds.  ERRA  is  also  expected  to  lead  revision  of  the \ncurrent  arrangements  for  subproject  approval,  implementation  and  fund \nflow  to  simplify  procedures  and  so  ensure  quick  implementation  and  full \ntransparency.  ERRA\u2019s  Governing  Council,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister, \nwill  approve  overall  programs  and  large  work  packages,  basically  fulfilling \nthe role of the Central Departmental Working Party in normal development \nprojects, but with a much shorter timeframe. ERRA\u2019s Board will oversee the \nimplementation  of  the  Project  through  provincial  and  district  line  agencies \nfollowing  current/revised  procedures  but  on  a  fact-track  basis.  ERRA  will \nalso  approve  major  changes  in  the  scope  and  cost  of  the  subprojects, \nannual  plans  and  budgets,  and  support  the  Project\u2019s  implementing \nagencies with financial and technical management.  \n\nthose  of \n\n(including \n\nERRA  will  be  staffed  by  various  specialist  professionals  deputed  from \nrelevant  government  departments \nfederal \nGovernment  and  other  provinces)  and  hired  from  the  private  sector  as \nnecessary for ERRA to carry out its functions. Periodic social and technical \nmonitoring, regular review, and overall fund flow and internal audits of the \nProject  will  be  carried  out  by  ERRA.  The  Controller  General  of  Accounts \n(CGA) will prescribe the related procedures and requirements for fiduciary \nmonitoring.  The  AJK  and  NWFP  implementing  agencies  will  develop  the \nsubprojects  following  the  selection  criteria  and  social  compliance,  through \npublic consultation as outlined in Appendix 10, which will be formalized in \nan operational manual to be prepared by ERRA.  \n\nthe \n\nThe  Governments  of  AJK  and  NWFP,  through  their  steering  committees \n(SCs)  specially  constituted  for  the  purpose  of  reconstruction  in  the  quake \naffected  areas,  chaired  by  the  Additional  Chief  Secretaries  of  AJK  and \nNWFP and having representation of ERRA, provincial line departments and \nthe  district  governments (in case of NWFP), will  be  responsible  for  over \n\n\f  v\n\nseeing  the  provincial  planning  and  implementation  of  subcomponents. \nThese  committees  will  be  supported  by  professionally  staffed \nreconstruction agencies (RA)\u2014the  NWFP Reconstruction Agency and the \nAJK  Reconstruction  Agency,  containing  various  specialist  staff,  will  be  for \nimplementation  of  subprojects  for  which  capacity  does  not  exist  at  with \nprovincial  and  district  line  departments  contracted  as  decided  by  the \nrespective  steering  committees  of  NWFP  and  AJK.    RAs  will  design  and \napprove  subprojects  falling  within  the  powers  delegated  to  the  RA  by  the \nprovincial Government and within the overall annual budget and work plan \napproved by ERRA.  The steering committees and ERRA will approve sub \nprojects,  work  plans,  budgets  and  provide  overall  guidance,  in  line  with \nemergency  procedures  to  be  put  in  place  by  the  ERRA  Council  and/or \nBoard.  For  the  subprojects  implemented  through  the  provincial  line \ndepartments/implementing  agencies,  and  the  district  governments,  where \ntechnical  capacity  exists  as  decided  by  the  respective  SCs,  additional \nsupport will be provided by deputing staff and by appointment of additional \nexpertise  as  required  to  meet  the  additional  work  load  and  fast  track \nrequirements,  due  diligence  and  reporting.  The  ERRA,  RAs,  and  line \ndepartments staff requirements, and related operating costs, will be funded \nthrough  incremental  administration  support,  supported  in  part  by  ADB \ngrant.\n\nThe  district  advisory  committees  (DACs)/district  development  committees \n(DDCs) headed by district coordination officer (DCO) or  Nazims in NWFP \nand deputy commissioners in AJK, will be responsible for the identification \nof  subprojects  and  needs,  and  recommend  plans  for  approval  of  the \nsteering committees. These plans will be approved annually by the steering \ncommittees  or  ERRA  and  implemented  through  RA  (through  their  district \nreconstruction  units),  line  departments  and  district  governments,  as \nrecommended bv SCs. Implementing agencies additional incremental staff \nand  overhead  cost \ntechnical \nbackstopping  and  technical  assistance  support  for  implementing  agencies \nto plan, design, supervise and implement the subprojects, will be financed \nby the Project. \n\nimplementation,  and \n\nfor  subproject \n\nfinancial  management,  accounting, \n\nThe Ministry of Finance will manage the multidonor Consolidated Fund for \nthe  Emergency  Earthquake  Assistance  established  in  the  State  Bank  of \nPakistan (SBP) through which the project funds will flow. ERRA is putting in \nplace  the  related  fiduciary  arrangements  to  ensure  transparency  in  funds \nflow, \ninternal  control  processes, \nprocurement,  periodic  financial  reporting,  monitoring  and  internal  and \nexternal  audits.  The  CGA  will  provide  the  related  guidelines,  and  ensure \nthat  all  relevant  Government  statutory  provisions  and  prudent  regulations \nare  followed.  Disbursement  of  project  funds  will  generally  follow  existing \naccounting  procedures.  The  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  (AGP)  will  be \nresponsible  for  determining  the  appropriate  auditing  arrangements  and \nensuring  the  timely  completion  of  audits  conducted  in  accordance  with \ninternationally accepted auditing practices.   \n\nFinancial\nManagement \n\n\fvi\n\nThe Project funds will be disbursed through the Consolidated Fund in SBP, \nto  the  imprest  account  operated  by  the  fund  manager\u2014the  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF)  for  the  quick-disbursing  components  and  ERRA  for  the \nother  components\u2014to  finance  components  of  the  Project.  MOF  will  make \nbudget  allocations  for  counterpart  funds  in  the  budget,  and  release  the \nGovernment\u2019s counterpart share as a grant in a separate account operated \nby the fund manager in the form of budget allocation, as a grant, released \nfrom  the  MOF  to  the  ERRA  Fund  (a  special  deposit  fund  in  public \naccount\u2014assignment  account).  The  ADB  funds  for  the  Project,  and \nGovernment\u2019s  counterpart  funds  will  be  released  to  ERRA  as  executing \nagency (excluding quick-disbursing component, for which MOF will be the \nexecuting  agency).  ERRA  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  ADB  loan \nand grant (imprested accounts), the Government counterpart funds and will \nrelease funds to the respective implementing agencies (second generation \nimprest  accounts)  as  advances  against  approved  budget/work  plan  at  the \nfederal,  provincial  and  district  levels.  All  funds  will  be  utilized  for  their \nintended  purposes  as  per  the  financing  plan,  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedures  set  down  by  CGA  and  ERRA.  ADB  funds  will  be  issued  with \nspecified  codes  for  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  program,  and  all \npayments and disbursements will be made based on those codes. A fund \nflow arrangement is in Appendix 9. \n\nERRA  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  financial  and  physical  progress \nreports,  as  well  as  annually  audited  financial  statements,  of  the  use  of \ndonor and ADB funds. Given the magnitude of funds, which will be passing \nthrough ERRA, the MOF has already proposed that ERRA should establish \nperiodic internal audits and reviews mechanisms, in consultation with other \ndonors and ADB. These will provide systemic feedback to improve financial \ntransparency. \nmanagement, \nProject  imprest  accounts  will  be  operated  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  AGP  will  nominate  private \nchartered  accountants,  if  required,  to  meet  the  increased  burden  on  CGA \nand to demonstrate transparency.\n\ntimeliness,  accountability  and \n\nfund \n\nflow \n\nAll  donor  funds  channeled  through  ERRA  will  be  subject  to  the  same \noperating  procedures  and  processes,  provided  as  Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  Based  on  the  preliminary  assessment  and  subject  to \nfinalization  of  implementation  and  financial  management  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  the  financial  management  arrangements  for  the \nProject are found to be satisfactory.  \n\n\fExecuting and \nImplementing\nAgencies\n\nProcurement \n\n  vii\n\nERRA  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  MOF  will  be  the \nexecuting agency for the quick-disbursing component. In order to fast-track \nthe  Project,  ERRA  is  located  within  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Secretariat  and \nhas  been  mandated  with  extraordinary  authority  to  expedite  the  recovery, \nreconstruction, and rehabilitation in the earthquake-affected areas. ERRA\u2019s \nGoverning  Council  consists  of  the  Prime  Minister  of  Pakistan  (Chair),  the \nprime  minister  for  AJK,  the  chief  minister  of  NWFP,  minister  for  Kashmir \nAffairs  and  Northern  Areas,  advisor  to  the  Prime  Minister  of  Pakistan, \ndeputy chairman of the Planning Commission, and the chairman of ERRA. \n\nUnder  ERRA,  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  Project  will  be  (i)  NWFP \nReconstruction  Authority,  (ii)  AJK  Reconstruction  Authority,  (iii)  PESCO, \nand (iv) IESCO. In NWFP and AJK, the various line departments will also \nbe  the  implementing  agencies  as  well  as  Sarhad  Hydro  Development \nOrganization  (SHYDO),  which  come  under  NWFP  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment and the Frontier Highways Authority (FHA) which comes under \nthe  NWFP  Works  and  Services.  The  steering  committees  established  for \nthe  purpose,  chaired  by  the  respective  Additional  Chief  Secretary  and \nhaving representation from ERRA, provincial line departments and districts \nwill  decide  about  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  sufficient  capacity  for  the \npurpose  of  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  The  implementation  of  the \nProject  will  generally  follow  procedures  already  in  place  for  ADB-financed \nprojects,  but  will  be  supported  by  additional  fast-track  mechanisms  and \nfund flow due diligence provided by ERRA. \n\nGiven  the  urgent  Project  needs,  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and \nservices will be carried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and \nexpedient procedures under the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy  and  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  contemplated \nimplementation schedule. Local competitive bidding procedures will be the \npreferred mode of procurement. Basically, the procurement procedures as \nthat already in place with the various line agencies for ongoing ADB loans \nare  simplified  as  allowed  under  the  special  procedures  for  emergency \nlending. The procurement of goods and related services estimated to cost \nmore  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  following  international  competitive \nbidding procedures. International shopping procedures will be followed for \nprocurement of goods and related services estimated at between $100,000 \nand  $1  million.  For  small,  specialized  equipment  and  materials  contracts \nvalued at less than $100,000, direct procurement procedures acceptable to \nADB  will  be  followed. Due to the urgent nature of this Project, the bidding \nperiod  for  international  competitive  bidding  will  be  shortened  to  30  days \nand,  for  local  competitive  bidding,  to  14  days.  Civil  works  contracts  worth \nover  $5  million  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding, \nand those estimated to cost $5 million or less will be procured through local \nto  ADB.  Community \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable \nparticipation  in  the  procurement  of  small  works  of  a  simple  nature  is \nencouraged. \n\n\fviii\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nProject Benefits \nand\nBeneficiaries\n\nFor the quick-disbursing component, all items on the positive list imported \nby  the  Government,  including  packages  procured  by  private  entities  on \nbehalf  of  the  Government,  following  normal  local  commercial  procedures \nfor  the  private  sector  and  standard  Government  procurement  procedures \nfor  the  public  sector  procurement,  where  such  procedures  are  functioning \nand appropriate and acceptable to ADB, are eligible. \n\nThe  implementation  of  the  earthquake  reconstruction  program  will  more \nthan double the normal level of development activities in NWFP and AJK, \nputting  unprecedented  stress  on  the  responsible  agencies.  The  most \nefficient  way  to  boost  their  human  and  skills  capacity  is  to  recruit \nexperienced  consultants.  This  implementation  support,  will  take  three \nforms:  (i)  legal  assistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building  ($2.5 \nmillion);  (ii)  incremental  administrative  support  ($5  million);  and  (iii) \nconsulting  services  ($7.5  million).  All  the  implementation  support  will  be \nfunded  from  the  ADB  grant  proceeds.  All  consulting  firms  and  individual \ninternational  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB. As the rehabilitation and reconstruction work to be financed under \nthe  Project  must  be  completed  within  36  months  due  to  its  urgent  nature, \nexpeditious selection and fielding of consultants is necessary. Accordingly, \nERRA  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  may  recruit  directly \nfrom  consultants  already  engaged  on  ADB-financed  projects  in  Pakistan \nand  now  providing  services  similar  to  those  required  for  the  Project.  This \narrangement  will  provide  an  efficient  way  to  recruit  consultants  under  the \ncircumstances.  In  any  other  cases,  the  consulting  services  from  firms  will \nbe  provided  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  using  simplified \ntechnical proposals. Individual consultants will be procured through ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for the recruitment of individual consultants. \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  regenerate  the \neconomy,  rehabilitate  public  infrastructure  and  utilities,  and  generate \nemployment. Priority will be given to providing work for earthquake-affected \npeople,  including  women,  to  help  reestablish  their  livelihoods.  The \nrehabilitation  of  damaged  and  lost  infrastructure,  particularly  road  and \npower  infrastructure  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  revive  economic \nactivities.  Reconstruction  of  education  and  healthcare  facilities  will  offer \nlong-term benefits for affected people.  \n\nThe legal assistance, governance, and institutional building subcomponent, \nwhich is an important part of reconstruction, will also support improvements \nin  gender  mainstreaming  and  the  elimination  of  legal  discrimination  and \ncultural  marginalization.  Orphans,  female  heads  of  households,  and \nwidowers will be trained in new social and income-earning roles to improve \nthe  well-being  of  their  families.  No  major  resettlement  impacts  are \nenvisaged under the Project. Restoration of the means of livelihood of poor \npeople  who  were  farmers  and  shepherds,  on  government  land  or  other \nland  not  privately  held  will  be  addressed.  Any  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  Government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.\n\n\fRisks and \nAssumptions\n\n \n\nix\n\nThe Project\u2019s initial environmental examination (IEE) determined that it is a \ncategory  B project.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \nprovides  the  procedures  to  be  followed  for  a  sector  loan  modality.  Based \non  the  Project\u2019s  initial  environmental  examination,  the  environmental \nimpacts will be mostly limited to construction related aspects, of which the \ndisposal of millions of tons of rubble is the major issue. These impacts will \nbe mitigated through careful construction procedures. \n\nThe  four  major  overarching  risks  for  the  Project  include  the  physical  risks \nassociated  with  unstable  mountain  slopes,  problems  of  access  and \nlogistics,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  such  a  massive \nreconstruction effort in a reasonable timeframe, and the local government\u2019s \ncapacity  to  properly  operate  and  maintain  the  new  facilities.  The  physical \nand  logistical  risks  include  (i)  aftershocks  causing  further  damage  to \nalready  weakened  structures  and  infrastructure;  (ii)  landslides  that  could \ncause  delays  in  restoration  of  services  and  reconstruction;  (iii)  remote \nlocations and difficult topography that make any reconstruction  logistically \ndifficult; (iv) high elevations in some areas that will limit reconstruction to a \nfew  months  in  the  summer  season,  (iv)  massive  relief  operations  and \ntemporary  housing  camps  that  could  hinder  or  delay  reconstruction, \nespecially in the vicinity of the larger towns; and (v) lack of available land \nfor infrastructure. \n\nThe  government\u2019s  capacity  in  NWFP,  and  especially  in  AJK  are  severely \nweakened  by  the  loss  of  many  of  their  own  buildings,  facilities,  and  staff \nmembers.  Compounding  the  difficulties  is  their  relative  lack  of  experience \nwith externally funded projects, which constitutes another risk. Substantial \nstrengthening  will  need  to  be  done  to  enable  them  to  fast-track  the \nemergency reconstruction works. The Government has established ERRA \nand  has  mandated  it  with  extraordinary  authority  to  open  bottlenecks  in \ncurrent procedures and so fast-track implementation.  \n\nPhysical risks will be mitigated by relocating roads, bridges, electrical lines, \nhuman  habitations  and  other  infrastructure  away  from  the  existing  and \npotentially  unstable  slopes  and/or  new  slide  areas.  All  new  facilities  will \nincorporate  earthquake  strengthening  and  other  damage-mitigation \nmeasures.  Logistics  of  access  and  climate  will  be  addressed  through \nprioritization  of  reconstruction  requirements  so  that  for  this  Project  only \nworks  that  can  realistically  be  completed  in  the  3-year  timeframe  are \nincluded.  ERRA,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  in  addition  to \nthe  normal  project  consultants,  will  be  supported  by  specialists  recruited, \nfrom  the  private  sector  to  strengthen  the  government\u2019s  own  staff,  and  to \nensure  that  they  can  attract  quality  personnel.  The  implementation \nassistance  component  will  finance  this  specialized  help,  estimated  to \ninclude more than 700 person-months. \n\n\fx\n\nTechnical\nAssistance\n\nindicated \n\nfunding \nthat \nThe  Government  has \nrequirement from the local governments will be waived for this emergency \nproject,  as  counterpart  funding  will  be  paid  by  the  central  government. \nSimilarly,  the  Government  is  aware  of  the  need  to  provide  operating \nsupport to some local utilities, education and health facilities, and electricity \ndistribution companies until their normal revenue sources can be restored.  \n\nthe  usual  counterpart \n\nImplementation  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of  quality \nsubprojects in the various project sectors will be mitigated in several ways. \nFirst,  detailed  subproject  criteria  will  be  developed,  in  addition  to  general \nsubproject  selection  criteria  already  agreed  to.  Second,  in  terms  of \nimplementation,  specific  monitoring  mechanisms  will \ninclude  regular \nfinancial audits as well as regular design and construction supervision and \nperformance  audits  through  random  audits  and  special  post-completion \naudits.\n\nGiven  the  relatively  high  degree  of  fiduciary  risk  associated  with  this \nProject,  and  the  extraordinary  challenges  over  the  Office  of  the  AGP  and \nthe office of the CGA, which are created by this Project as well as by other \ndonor  Projects,  ADB  will  ensure  that  these  agencies  will be  provided  with \nadequate  resources  to  meet  their  fiduciary  responsibilities.  In  conjunction \nwith  the  Project,  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  proposed  for  building  the \ncapacity  of  the  office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  (AGP)  and  the \noffice of the CGA. The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which ADB \nwill finance $2.0 million on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe  TA  includes  provision  of  192  person-months  domestic  and  9  person-\nmonths  international  consultant.  Consultants  will  provide  training  and \ntechnical  advice  in  various  aspects  of  audit,  accounts  and  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  AGP  and  CGA  will  be  the  executing \nagencies for the TA. The proposed TA is scheduled to be implemented for \n36  months  from  January  2006  to  January  2009.    Administration  of  the \nproposed TA will be delegated to ADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission. \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant  and  loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Earthquake  Emergency  Assistance \nProject (the Project), and (ii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for the \nOffice of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP). The Project will assist the early reconstruction \nof damaged infrastructure and restore livelihoods that were severely affected by the earthquake \nof 8 October 2005. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nNatural Disasters in Pakistan and the Region \n\n2. \nThe  northern  parts  of  South  Asia  have  a  history  of  earthquakes  arising  from  its \ngeological and tectonic history. The basic geological fact is that the Euro-Asian Plate is colliding \nwith  the  Indian  Plate  along  an  alignment  that  more  or  less  coincides  with  the  Himalayan \nMountains.  Earthquakes  of  low  magnitudes  occur  from  time  to  time  in  this  area  as  the \nsubduction  of  the  Indian  Plate  continues.  An  occasional  high-magnitude  earthquake  occurs \nwhen there is a sudden release of energy in this process. Accurate forecasting of earthquakes \nis very difficult, if not impossible, with current technologies. In the province of Balochistan, the \nearthquake of 1935 is well documented and it killed some 26,000 people. Taking into account all \nnatural disasters that the country has experienced, the earthquake of 8 October 2005 is clearly \nthe worst in terms of deaths, injuries, property loss, and damage to infrastructure. \n\nB. \n\nImpact of the Earthquake on Northern Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir  \n\n3. \nOn 8 October 2005, at 8:50 a.m. Pakistan Standard Time, an earthquake measuring 7.6 \non  the  Richter  scale  was  recorded  in  Pakistan,  Afghanistan,  and  India.  The  earthquake\u2019s \nepicenter was 100 kilometers north-northeast of Islamabad, along the fault line where the Indian \nPlate  meets  the  Eurasian  Plate.  Tremors  were  felt  across  a  wide  swath  of  South  Asia,  from \ncentral  Afghanistan  to  western  Bangladesh.  As  of  27  October  2005,  the  Geological  Survey  of \nPakistan registered more than 1,000 aftershocks, many of which ranged from 5.0 to 6.0 on the \nRichter scale.  \n\n4. \nLasting  for  about  2  minutes,  the  8  October  2005  earthquake  is  arguably  the  most \ndebilitating  natural  disaster  in  Pakistan\u2019s  history.  Pakistan-administered  Azad  Jammu  and \nKashmir (AJK)1 and the eastern districts of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) bore the \nfull force of the earthquake in terms of number of lives lost, injuries sustained, and destruction of \ninfrastructure  and  economic  assets.  Substantial  public  and  private  assets  in  social  services \ndelivery,  governance,  commerce,  communications,  and  shelter  were  either  badly  damaged  or \ndestroyed in at least three districts of AJK and five districts of NWFP. \n\n5. \nAccording  to  the  figures  provided  by  the  Government,  as  of  3  November  2005, \napproximately 73,000 people had died and more than 70,000 were severely injured or disabled. \nOver 2.8 million people have been left without shelter, and it is estimated that about 2.3 million \npersons are without adequate food primarily due to the disruption of the transport system and \nloss of stored food. The terrain in affected areas of both NWFP and AJK is highly diversified and \n                                                \n1  Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is an area over which India and Pakistan have been in dispute since 1947.  ADB \ndoes not intend to make any judgment as to the legal or other status of any disputed territories or  to prejudice the \nfinal determination of the parties\u2019 claims. \n\n\f2\n\nincludes densely populated areas as well as rugged, mountainous areas with small, dispersed \nrural  settlements.  Official  estimates  of  the  damage  remain  conservative  as  many  isolated \ncommunities  in  the  earthquake-affected  region  remain  inaccessible,  which  foreshadows  an \nincrease  in  official  figures  as  these  areas  are  eventually  reached.  Furthermore,  the  United \nNations has issued a warning indicating that more lives will be lost if additional relief does not \nmaterialize before the imminent onset of the Himalayan winter. \n\n6. \nMany  government  buildings\u2014including  hospitals;  health  clinics;  provincial  and  local \ngovernment  administration  offices;  police,  judiciary  and  penal  facilities;  and  schools  and \ncolleges\u2014were destroyed or severely damaged. The earthquake has had a devastating impact \non the delivery of all social services in the affected areas. The most seriously affected sectors \nare transport, health and education, power, and water supply and sanitation. They have suffered \nnot  only  destruction  or  serious  damage  to  physical  facilities,  but  also  through  the  death  or \nserious injury of care providers including nurses, doctors, health workers, teachers, and schools \nstaff.\n\nC. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Response\n\nto \n\nThe  Government \n\nresponded  quickly \n\n7. \nthe  earthquake  emergency.  Although \ncommunications  with  the  most  severely  affected  areas  and  populations  were  severed,  the \nPresident  and  Prime  Minister  visited  affected  sites  the  first  day  after  the  disaster.  Two  army \ndivisions  moved  into  NWFP  and  AJK  and  set  up  five  advanced  staging  posts  to  facilitate  the \ndistribution of relief goods. The geography of some affected areas has led the Government to \ncall for an unprecedented number of helicopters to assist with the distribution of relief goods. As \nof 2 November 2005, a fleet of more than 125 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, both foreign \nand domestic, have made over 5,000 sorties to affected areas.   \n\n8. \nThe  Prime  Minister  has  outlined  a  12-point  national  strategy  for  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation.  The  Prime  Minister\u2019s  office  has  appointed  a  Federal  Relief  Commission  and \ncorresponding  relief  coordinator,  with  the  overall  responsibility  for  overseeing  relief  efforts \ntargeting shelter, food, clean water, and immediate medical care.  At the district and grassroots \nlevels, military relief personnel have been stationed to facilitate the distribution of relief goods. \nFurthermore,  the  President  has  established  an  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation \nAuthority  (ERRA)  to  facilitate  the  rebuilding  and  repair  of  damaged  infrastructure,  including \nhousing, roads, bridges, government buildings, schools, and hospitals.   \n\nAs  of  11  November  2005,  the  Government  had  distributed  350,000  tents,  3.2  million \n9. \nblankets, and 3,000 tons of medicine, and had established tent villages for earthquake-affected \npersons.  The  Government  has  made  available  army  medical  teams  comprised  of  medical \nofficers and paramedics in at least 13 stations in and around the affected districts of AJK and \nNWFP.  The  Government  has  also  announced  a  program  that  includes  compensation  of \nPRs100,000  for  each  family  that  has  lost  members,  PRs50,000  for  each  individual  who \nsustained serious injury, and PRs25,000 for each individual with minor injuries. The maximum \namount  of  assistance  given  to  each  family  under  this  program  is  PRs500,000,  and \ndisbursements have already begun. \n\nD. \n\nNeeds Assessment \n\nAt the request of the Government, a mission led by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n10. \nand  the  World  Bank  conducted  a  preliminary  damage  and  needs  assessment  (PDNA)  to \nestimate  the  scale  of  damage  caused  by  the  8  October  2005  earthquake.  Experts  from  other \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nfor \n\ninternational  organizations,  including  the  European  Union,  Department  for  International \nDevelopment,  United  Kingdom,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  United  States  Agency \nInternational  Development,  Food  and \nAgricultural  Organization  (FAO)  of  the  United  Nations,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF),  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  other  United  Nations  (UN) \nagencies  also  participated  in  this  assessment.  Team  members  visited  the  nine  most  heavily \naffected  districts  of  Abbottabad,  Battagram,  Kohistan,  Mansehra,  and  Shangla  in  NWFP  and \nBagh, Neelum, Muzaffarabad, and Poonch in AJK to verify and evaluate the intensity of disaster \ndamage  and  to  meet  with  both  civil  administration  authorities  and  people  from  affected \ncommunities.  The  assessment  team  also  met  with  a  range  of  civil  society,  international, \ngovernmental  and  development  partner  organizations  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  full \nspectrum  of  issues  that  are  likely  to  influence  the  recovery  strategy.  The  major  donors\u2019 \nconference in Islamabad on 19 November 2005 further defined the final breakdown of donors\u2019 \nsectoral responsibilities.  \n\n11. \nThe  PDNA  began  on  24  October  2005  and  concluded  on  12  November  2005.  It  has \nbeen revised based on comments received from the Government and other stakeholders. The \nGovernment  endorsed  the  findings  of  the  report  on  11  November  2005.  Appendix  2  is  a \nsummary  of  the  PDNA,  which  is  available  in  full  as  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  ADB \nwebsite (www.adb.org) offers relevant publications. \n\nE. \n\nImpact of the Earthquake \n\n12. \nThe  overall  cost  associated  with  the  earthquake  is  estimated  at  approximately  $5.2 \nfor  victims,  and \nbillion,  which \nreconstruction. The cost of reconstructing lost assets and restoring services is estimated to be \nPRs208.1 billion ($3.5 billion). \n\nincludes  estimated  costs \n\nlivelihood  support \n\nfor  relief, \n\n1. \n\nEstimated Damages and Reconstruction Costs  \n\nDirect  Damage.    Preliminary  estimates  of  direct  damage  sustained  due  to  the \n13.\nearthquake total to PRs135.1 billion ($2.3 billion), as presented in Table 1. These estimates are \nbased  on  the  book  value  of  the  assets.  The  largest  component  is  private  housing,  which \namounts to PRs61.2 billion ($1.03 billion), followed by transport sector totaling PRs20.2 billion \n($340  million),  and  to  the  education  sector  equaling  PRs19.9 billion  ($335  million).  Direct \ndamage to agriculture and livestock is also sizeable, totaling PRs12.9 billion ($218 million). The \nlosses to industry and services amount to PRs8.6 billion ($144 million).\n\n14. \nThe  level  of  direct  damage  is  worse  in  AJK  than  in  NWFP.  For  AJK,  it  amounts  to \nPRs76.4 billion ($1.3 billion) and for NWFP, PRs56.4 billion ($950 million). In most sectors, the \ndestruction of physical assets in AJK is greater than that in NWFP. \n\nIndirect  Losses.  The  indirect  losses  resulting  from  the  direct  damage  are  PRs34.2 \n15.\nbillion ($576 million). The indirect losses are comparable in absolute values between NWFP and \nAJK. The estimated indirect losses do not take into account the beneficial effect of rehabilitation \nand  reconstruction  activities  on  future  output.  Reconstruction  will  not  only  restore  physical \nassets  but  also  permit  improved  production  of  goods  and  services.  Hence,  the  estimates  of \nindirect losses presented above are likely to be on the higher side in the case of output losses. \n\nReconstruction  Costs.  The  cost  of  reconstruction  of  lost  assets  and  restoration  of \n16.\npublic services is estimated at PRs208 billion ($3.5 billion).  Reconstruction costs are valued at \n\n\f4\n\nimproved  standard  replacement  rate,  including  the  cost  of  rebuilding  to  earthquake-resistant \nstandards in a manner suitable to local conditions.  This is necessary given the high degree of \nexposure to future natural disasters in the affected areas. \n\nTable 1: Preliminary Estimate of Total Losses and Reconstruction Costs  \n\nDirect\nDamage \n(PRs million) \n\nIndirect \nLosses \n(PRs million)\n\nReconstruction \nCostsa\n(PRs million) \n\nReconstruction \nCostsa\n($ million)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShare of \nTotal \nReconst. \nCosts (%) \n\nSector\n\nA.

In fiscal year (FY) 2006, GDP \ngrowth was projected in June at 7%, with recent data suggesting the growth will be around 6.5%. \nThe additional impact of the earthquake is likely to bring output growth further down, to around \n6.1%.2   This  loss  is  due  to  a  projected  reduction  in  NWFP  output  in  FY2006.  In  addition,  the \noutput  loss  in  AJK  could  amount  to  PRs76.4  billion  ($297  million),  or  27%  of  AJK\u2019s  2004\u201305 \noutput.  As  reconstruction  activity  starts,  the  impact  on  GDP  growth  could  actually  be  positive, \nfelt mostly in FY2007 and FY2008. \n\n18. \nAt the macroeconomic level, the most significant impact of the earthquake is expected to \nbe on the fiscal deficit of the Government. In the absence of any offsetting revenue increases \n\n                                                \n2 This assumes that all of the income loss will fall in fiscal year 2006, an assumption that may overstate the impact of \n\nthe earthquake on growth.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nand  expenditure  reductions,  the  earthquake  is  projected  to  increase  the  FY2006  deficit  of  the \nGovernment between 0.6% and 1.0% of GDP. The budgets of NWFP and AJK will be unable to \naccommodate a significant share of the relief and reconstruction expenditures, although it is to \nbe expected (and desirable) that they would have significant role in the reconstruction process. \n\n19. \nThe  earthquake  has  now  created  additional  expenditure  needs  to  cover  for  relief, \nreconstruction,  and  rehabilitation  costs.  These  pressures  could  pose  difficulties  for  Pakistan\u2019s \nmacroeconomic  balances  and  may  undermine  the  achievement  of  its  long-term  development \ngoals,  unless  additional  concessional  financing  is  made  available  by  the  international \ncommunity. A key element of the Pakistan\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is the utilization \nof the additional fiscal space created by prudent fiscal policy and aid to meet development and \npoverty-reduction  objectives.  It  is,  therefore,  important  that  priority  public  expenditures  be \nprotected,  so  that  Pakistan  can  continue  to  improve  service  delivery  of  health,  education,  and \npublic infrastructure. The Government has indicated that it would be prepared to absorb a part \nof  the  budgetary  impact  of  the  earthquake  by  making  cuts  in  low-priority  expenditures  and \nraising  additional  domestic  revenue.  These  adjustments  would  be  needed  irrespective  of  the \namount  and  type  of  financing  that  the  donor  community  would  provide.  However,  given  the \nlimited  magnitude  of  resources  for  rehabilitation  of  the  affected  areas,  it  is  unlikely  that  the \nGovernment will be able to fully absorb the fiscal impact of the earthquake without significantly \naffecting public sector development activities.  \n\n20. \n Pressure on the external trade balance has arisen from strong aggregate demand and \nfactors  not  directly  related  to  the  earthquake.    The  earthquake  may  cause  an  increase  (albeit \nlimited) in imports of fuel, food, and construction materials. A delay in aid inflows to finance the \nGovernment\u2019s earthquake expenditures would aggravate pressure on balance of payments. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSocial, Poverty, Environment, and Livelihood Impact  \n\nSocial Impact. The earthquake has so far claimed more than 73,000 lives, while 70,000 \n21.\nare injured and 2.8 million left homeless. In addition to the immense damage and loss of life, the \nearthquake  increased  vulnerabilities  among  the  surviving  population.  In  particular,  the  factors \ncreating  new  vulnerabilities  or  contributing  to  existing  ones  include  internal  displacement  and \nmarginalization based on gender, age, and disabilities. \n\n22.  Marginalized  and  vulnerable  groups  may  not  be  able  to  access  emergency  assistance \non an equal basis with others. In particular, female-headed households, widows, and orphaned \nchildren  are  at  risk  of  (i)  having  little  or  no  access  to  supplies  and  services  and  (ii)  losing \nproperty claims owing to their lack of proper identity papers. Many elderly and disabled are likely \nto  have  lost  their  support  network.  Physical  and  psychological  disabilities  suffered  as  a \nconsequence of the earthquake need to be taken into account, as they incur lasting liabilities in \nterms of economic costs and social exclusion. Long-term health expenses and rehabilitation will \nbe important burdens on families and the Government alike.  \n\nThe  new  poor,  created  by  the  disaster,  may  also  face  financial  problems  and  social \n\n23. \npressure if they are unable to repay formal or informal loans obtained before the earthquake. \n\nThe  health  and  nutrition  of  the  vulnerable  people  are  threatened  by  a  diminished  and \n\n24. \nunbalanced diet.  \n\n25.\n\nPoverty. The earthquake-affected areas were not the poorest in Pakistan, but they were, \n\n\f6\n\neven before the earthquake, among the most vulnerable. Geographical remoteness and a harsh \nclimate have made these areas particularly vulnerable to sudden disasters. \n\n26. \nOf  the  total  of  2.4  million  people  employed  at  the  time  of  the  earthquake,  almost  84% \nwere living below the poverty line of $2 per day. In addition, women and youths in the affected \nprovinces had difficulty finding employment.  \n\n27. \nThe depletion and degradation of natural resources have been particularly severe in the \nearthquake-affected areas. The reduction in average land availability per household due to land \nfragmentation, erosion, and landslides has resulted in households becoming increasingly poorer. \nDemographic pressure and price increases have also worsened vulnerable groups\u2019 exposure to \npoverty.\n\n28.  Most  of  the  jobs  in  the  affected  provinces  are  in  relatively  less  productive  sectors, \nparticularly agriculture, livestock, and informal services. These sectors are without social safety \nnets and supplemented by secondary income sources (such as off-farm jobs) and remittances. \nThus,  the  loss  of  employment,  even  for  a  short  time,  is  likely  to  precipitate  a  decline  into \nconditions of extreme poverty for many families.  \n\n 29. \nThe vulnerable groups described in the previous section are at risk of becoming poorer. \nThe situation is particularly critical for children, many of whom may be orphaned, homeless, and \nout of school, which may force them to seek alternative forms of support. Without help, poverty \namong  these  groups  will  constantly  grow,  with  little  hope  for  the  future.  A  social  security \nmechanism  should  be  put  place  for  the  survival  of  people  who  are  not  able  to  provide  for \nthemselves.\n\nEnvironment. The earthquake has damaged the environment. Impacts on ecosystems \n30.\nare  often  less  dramatic  than  structural  damage  due  to  their  slower  manifestation.  Considering \nthat  the  environment  of  the  affected  area  was  vulnerable  even  before  the  earthquake, \ncomprising  fragile  mountain  ecosystems,  significant  long-term  adverse  impacts  are  likely.  A \ndetailed  environmental  assessment  of  the  impacts  of  the  earthquake  is  urgently  needed  to \nquantify  losses  to  forest,  aquatic,  and  terrestrial  ecosystems,  including  biodiversity,  and  to \nrestore damaged ecosystems.\n\n31. \nThe most visible consequence of the earthquake is the enormous quantity of debris and \nrubble  from  damaged  and  destroyed  structures.  Preliminary  estimates  indicate  that  up  to  200 \nmillion tons of rubble may need disposal.  \n\n32. \nThe main environmental impacts from the earthquake resulted from landslides. While the \nexposed soil surfaces now appear to be in a state of equilibrium, a second phase of landslides \nis likely, and largely unpreventable, with the onset of seasonal rains and the melting of snow in \nthe  spring.  The  loss  of  forest  cover  over  the  last  decade  due  to  encroachment,  illegal  timber \nfelling,  and  agriculture  will  likely  exacerbate  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  landslides.  This  risk \ncontinues today as demand for lumber for reconstruction could further denude slopes of forests. \n\nSocial Network, Employment, and Livelihoods. Community cohesion is threatened by \n33.\nforced  migration.  However,  the  interdependence  of  surviving  members  on  each  other  and  on \ncomparatively resource-rich households may restore some measure of social cohesion. \n\n34. \nCommunity-based  organizations  and  civil  society  networks  administering  to  vulnerable \ngroups  before  the  quake  are  not  functioning  as  they  did.  The  quake\u2019s  impact  on  government \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ninfrastructure  and  services  has  crippled  the  ability  of  individuals  to  exercise  their rights  and  to \nseek legal redress and protection. One of the major challenges will be to reduce the procedural \nburden and legal requirements for obtaining compensation. \n\nThe  livelihood  assets  of  affected  people  have  been  substantially  reduced.  Human \n35. \nresources and capacities are weakened; traditional and skilled labor in the informal sector does \nnot provide any form of job security. \n\nEstimates show the total loss in employment to be around 324,000 jobs, equal to about \n36. \n29% of the employed population above the age of 10 in the affected districts. About 38% and \n25% of total employment in the affected districts of AJK and NWFP, respectively, are estimated \nto  be  lost.  The  largest  job  losses  are  in  agriculture,  small  businesses  and  shops,  and \nconstruction,  while  no  employment  loss  is  assumed  for  migrant  workers  and  public  sector \nemployees. Employment losses will likely have impact on nearly 1.6 million people. \n\nF. \n\nEarthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority \n\n37. \nThe  ERRA  was  established  by  the  Government  on  24  October  2005  to  guide \nreconstruction  work,  undertake  strategic  planning  in  the  affected  districts,  and  coordinate  the \nimplementation of works in the two affected provinces. It is located within the Prime Minister\u2019s \nSecretariat with a mission to expedite the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and final recovery of the \nearthquake-affected areas.  ERRA has the following functions:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\nassess damage and needs in the quake-affected areas;  \nformulate a comprehensive program to provide for planned settlements, housing, \ngovernment buildings and offices, utilities and services, infrastructure, health and \neducation  facilities,  and  irrigation  and  agriculture  facilities  including  watershed \nprotection and environmental programs;   \nensure  that  resettlement  plans  are  formulated  for  subprojects  with  resettlement \nimpacts prior to the award of contracts;  \noversee the identification of projects;  \nprescribe cost-effective technology;  \nreview and revise building codes to incorporate earthquake-resistant design in all \nrepairs and new construction;  \npromote the development of reconstruction-related industry in the affected area;  \nfacilitate  and  organize  direct  contributions  by  the  private  sector  and  bilateral \ndonors for reconstructing housing, hospitals, schools, and other facilities;  \nprovide oversight and overall monitoring; and  \nfacilitate  disbursement  of  funds  to  the  provincial  agencies  responsible  for  the \nday-to-day implementation of reconstruction. \n\nERRA\u2019s  Governing  Council  consists  of  the  key  senior-most  Government  officials \n38. \nresponsible for reconstruction including the Prime Minister of Pakistan (chair), the prime minister \nfor AJK, the chief minister of NWFP, minister for Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas, advisor to \nthe Prime Minister of Pakistan, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and the chairman \nof  ERRA.  ERRA  will  prepare  an  annual  budget  and  maintain  proper  accounts,  which  will  be \naudited by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP). \n\n39. \nERRA is responsible for the timely implementation of reconstruction and has been given \nauthority  to  expedite  various  central  and  provincial  government  processes,  such  as  land \nacquisition and  the  rapid  transfer  of  disbursement  funds,  and  to  support  provincial  and  district \nlevel line agencies\u2019 planning and implementation of works. ERRA is charged with ensuring that \n\n\f8\n\nthe usual slow pace of implementation by the provincial agencies is stepped up to meet the 3-\nyear timeframe for restoring services and facilities.  \n\nG. \n\nResponse of Development Partners \n\n40. \nThe  Government  requested  international  assistance,  which  started  arriving  within  days \nof  the  earthquake.    As  of  11  November  2005,  according  to  Government  reports,  assistance \ntotaling  nearly  $2.5  billion  had  been  pledged  by  a  total  of  83  bilateral  and  multilateral  donors, \nwith  many  also  providing  to  the  relief  effort  significant  in-kind  support,  including  logistical  and \nmanpower  assistance.  Major  contributions  have  been  pledged  by  Australia,  Canada,  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Denmark, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway, Saudi \nArabia,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Turkey,  United  Arab  Emirates,  United  Kingdom,  and  United \nStates. Other donors include Algeria, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, \nRepublic of Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Oman, and Ukraine, among others. The World Bank \napproved  supplemental  financing  of  $200  million  within  weeks  of  the  earthquake  to  help  the \nGovernment  meet  emergency  expenditure  requirements.  The  United  Nations  immediately \ndeployed  its  Disaster  Assessment  and  Coordination  team  to  provide  technical  assistance  for \nassessing  the  scale  of  the  disaster  and  to  help  manage  the  international  response.  UNDP  is \nhelping  to  coordinate  relief  efforts  both  nationally  and  locally.  Other  UN  specialized  agencies \nsuch  as  UNICEF,  World  Food  Programme,  and  United  Nations  Population  Fund  have  also \nprovided emergency relief assistance.\n\n41. \nOn  26  October  2005,  the  secretary-general  of  the  UN  hosted  a  ministerial-level \ninternational  donors\u2019  conference  in  Geneva  to  discuss  Pakistan\u2019s  short-term  requirements  for \nrelief assistance. The UN launched a flash appeal for $550 million in immediate relief assistance \nto Pakistan. About $140 million has been earmarked for an emergency push to feed and provide \nshelter to those affected. The Geneva conference was followed by another multidonor event in \nIslamabad on 19 November 2005 aimed at boosting resources for the medium- to longer-term \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  programs.  The  total  pledged  from  all  international  donors  is \nestimated at about $6.1 billion. \n\nH. \n\nADB\u2019s Response and Strategy \n\n42. \nAt  the  international  donor\u2019s  conference  on  earthquake  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation \nheld on 19 November 2005 in Islamabad, ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda announced that ADB \nwould  provide  up  to  $1  billion  in  reconstruction  and  recovery  assistance  to  Pakistan  during \n2005\u20132006.  \n\nOn  14  November  2005,  ADB\u2019s  Board  approved  $105  million  from  loan  savings  to  the \n43. \nDecentralization  Support  Program  (DSP).  DSP \nloan  with  an \nimplementation  mechanism  in  place,  including  accounting,  disbursement,  and  fiduciary  risk-\nmanagement measures. On the same day, the Board approved the establishment of Pakistan \nEarthquake Fund, including an initial contribution from ADB of $80 million in grant financing.  \n\nis  an  existing  program \n\nThe  first  phase  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  earthquake  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation, \n44. \ncomprising the $105 million for the DSP and $300 million for the proposed Project, brings total \nproposed  assistance  to  $405  million.  The  second  phase  of  the  proposed  assistance,  targeted \nfor approval in 2006, is estimated at about $595 million. ADB also actively seeks support from \nbilateral donors as well as the private sector to use the fund as a mechanism to deliver prompt \nand effective assistance.  \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nADB\u2019s  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  is  reviewing  a  number  of  ongoing  loans  in  the \n45. \nearthquake-affected  areas  that  can  be  redesigned  to  more  effectively  address  earthquake \ndamage. In  some cases, savings within these loans will be reallocated to address earthquake \nrehabilitation. \n\nI. \n\nHazard Risk Management \n\n46. \nIt  is important  to  take  into  account some  of  the  factors  that  may  have  exacerbated  the \ndamage  in  affected  areas.  These  critical  factors  should  be  reflected  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of the recovery strategy, as existing vulnerabilities should be mitigated as much \nas possible rather than repeated. \n\nSeismotectonic  considerations  indicate  that  similar  or  larger  events  in  the  same  or \n47. \nneighboring  regions  may  be  possible.  A  seismological  observation  network  exists  but  needs \nmodernization.  Efforts  to  undertake  a  new  seismic  risk  analysis  of  Pakistan  should  also  be \nintensified.  Similarly,  assessments  of  risks  in  the  affected  areas  should  guide  reconstruction \ndecisions.  Further  multi-hazard  risk  mapping  for  the  country,  including  the  affected  areas, \nshould guide future development plans.  \n\nA  national  disaster  management  strategy \n\n48. \nthat  enhances  existing  entities  and \nmechanisms  should  be  devised  and  implemented.  Communities,  local  authorities,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  should  be  encouraged  to  cooperate  and  be  better \nprepared.\n\nJ. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n49. \nA  review  of  ADB-wide  experience  with  rehabilitation  assistance indicates  the  following \nessential factors: (i) projects must be prepared as quickly as possible; (ii) projects should focus \non restoring facilities; (iii) to the extent possible, rehabilitation works should be completed within \n2\u20133  years;  (iv)  as  implementation  places  a  heavy  burden  on  executing  agency  staff,  and \ntherefore, strong consulting support and ADB supervision is needed during implementation; and \n(v)  efforts  should  be  made  to  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  rapid  response  to  disasters  is  matched  by \nequally  quick  action  by  the  government.  Lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  earlier  emergency \nprojects  include  the  following:  (i)  beneficiary  participation  must  be  ensured  and  increased  in \nproject  preparation  and  implementation,  especially  in  the  maintenance  of  facilities;  (ii) \nenvironmental  and  social  aspects  should  be  considered  during  project  implementation,  even \nthough the need for a rapid response may not permit a detailed treatment of these issues prior \nto  the  approval  of  the  assistance;  (iii)  arrangements  for  disbursement,  including  retroactive \nfinancing and the use of imprest accounts,(cid:3)should give the executing agencies quick and simple \naccess to funds; (iv) project objectives and scope need to be carefully defined; and (v) criteria \nfor  subproject  selection  should  permit  simple  prioritization  of  subprojects  and  demand  short \nimplementation periods. \n\n50. \nPost-earthquake reconstruction is a major investment. The Government should take this \nopportunity to protect the reconstruction of public and private buildings and infrastructure from \nvarious types of hazards. Lessons learned from the damage should be fed into reconstruction \nplanning, and future risks reduced, through improved building standards and design. The safety \nof public buildings such as schools and hospitals is particularly important and should incorporate \nappropriately improved building standards to reduce their risks. Both in the reconstruction phase \nand in urban development plans, land-use plans need to integrate the identification of risk areas. \nBuildings  collapsed  in  northern  Pakistan  because  of  very  poor  construction  quality  and  the \n\n\f10\n\nabsence  of  any  seismic  consideration  in  their  design.  The  primary  lesson  learned  is  that  new \nbuildings need to be seismically designed and built to a higher quality. Compliance with present \nregulations  and  more  stringent  codes  in  the  future  needs  stronger  enforcement.  During  the \nreconstruction phase, the repair of damaged buildings needs to include seismic strengthening. \nAdditionally,  the  feasibility  of  a  national  seismic  retrofitting  program  for  buildings  should  be \nexamined, with schools and hospitals as priorities.   \n\n51. \nThe lessons and experiences of current relief and recovery coordination should be used \nto develop an appropriate disaster-management mechanism and authority, as well as a national \nplan  that  clarifies  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  different  government  agencies  and \nstrengthens  coordination  among  them.  Risk  management  education  and  training  the  staff  of \nappropriate  agencies  would  greatly  improve  risk  management  in  the  country.  Primary  and \nsecondary schools should also raise awareness of risks as part of the curriculum. Incorporating \nrisk-mitigation  safety  measures  into  the  basic  training  of  engineers,  contractors,  and  builders \nshould  also  be  considered  as  part  of  the  reconstruction  process.  A  major  public  awareness \ncampaign  on  risks,  preparedness,  and  vulnerability  reduction  should  be  implemented  as  soon \nas  possible.  The  feasibility  of  tailoring  an  insurance  package  to  the  poor  that  addresses  their \nmain  post-disaster  risks  should  be  investigated,  as  should  investing  in  ex  ante  risk-reduction \nmeasures.\n\nThese  lessons  have  been  considered  and  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  proposed \n52. \nProject. Indeed, ADB\u2019s response has been very rapid. Within a few days of the calamity, a team \nof ADB-funded disaster management experts started to provide assistance to the Government; \nwithin  2  weeks,  a  multidonor  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment  Mission  led  by  ADB  and  the \nWorld  Bank  was  fielded  to  help  the  Government  assess  the  damage  and  evolve  a  short-  and \nmedium-term recovery and rehabilitation strategy. With an implementation period of 36 months, \nthe  Project  focuses  on  the  immediate  rehabilitation  of  physical  and  social  infrastructure  in  the \naffected  areas  and  the  restoration  of  livelihoods  for  those  affected.  The  proposed  Project  has \nbeen  prepared  to  complement  assistance  from  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  and \ndonors.\n\n53. \nTo  ensure  timely  implementation,  the  responsibility  for  project  administration  will  be \ndelegated to the Pakistan Resident Mission in Islamabad, immediately upon loan effectiveness. \nIf appropriate, ADB will also consider establishing an extended mission in Muzzafarabad for the \nduration of project implementation to provide day-to-day support and guidance to the AJK line \nagencies provide on the spot review of various documents and closely monitor compliance with \nADB requirements. Pakistan Resident Mission or the possible extended mission will assist with \nquality  control,  speedy  implementation  of  subprojects,  and  rapid  assistance  to  ERRA,  AJK, \nNWFP,  the  line  agencies  and  districts  on  any  project  implementation  matters.  It  will  carry  out \nrandom  spot  checks  on  procurement  and  project  accounts  of  subprojects,  and  inspect  project \nfacilities for quality control and proper financial management.  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n54. \nThe expected impact of the Project is to contribute to reversing the devastating impact of \nthe  earthquake  and  so revive  economic  activity  and  enable  people  to  resume  their  livelihoods \nand return to normal life. This will be achieved by rehabilitating and reconstructing damaged and \ndestroyed infrastructure as quickly as possible, which will particularly assist the poor and other \nvulnerable people. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n55. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  the  selected  sectors  identified  through  consultation  with  the \nGovernment,  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  other  donors.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate \npublic \ninfrastructure  and  adopt  appropriately  revised  earthquake-resistant  design  and \nconstruction  standards  in  all  construction  undertaken.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide \ncapacity  building  to  enhance  rehabilitation  capacity  and  institution  building  for  sustainable \ndevelopment. \n\nThe Project has been developed in close cooperation with other donors, all of which are \n56. \nintimately involved in post-earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction in the affected areas of \nPakistan. The choice of sectors and the project design is based on the findings of the ADB and \nWorld Bank-led PDNA. Specifically, the World Bank is likely to concentrate on housing, national \nhighways, and social sectors. Close coordination among the donors and Government has been \nmaintained throughout the processing of the Project. \n\n57.  Members of the project team visited affected districts and held discussions with relevant \nGovernment  and  relief  agencies  on  the  ground,  as  well  as  with  affected  people.  Subsequent \ndiscussions  with  development  partners  and  the  Government  helped  project  formulation  to \nevolve  based  partly  on  comparative  advantage  and  sectoral  presence  in  the  affected  region, \nand  also  in  regard  to  project  scope.  The  project  design  also  draws  on  ADB\u2019s  considerable \nexperience in delivering emergency assistance in developing member countries over the past 2 \ndecades.  The  Project  is  linked  with  and  complements  relief  and  assistance  provided  by  the \nGovernment, NGOs, UN, and other donors, and it takes the necessary next steps to ensure that \nassistance will be sustainable.  \n\n58. \nIn  terms  of  its  broad  overall  scope  and  objectives  to  support  poverty  reduction  and \nprotect and promote livelihoods, the Project is consistent with the goals of Pakistan's Medium-\nTerm  Development  Framework 2005\u20132010.  It  is  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram  for  Pakistan,  which  prioritizes  improving  physical  and  social  infrastructure  to  support \npro-poor  growth  and  poverty  reduction  throughout  the  country.  The  Project  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.3\n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n59. \nThe  Project  comprises  three  components:  (i)  quick-disbursement,  (ii)  project  sector \ncomponents, and (iii) implementation assistance. These components are designed to operate in \na mutually supportive fashion to achieve the overall objective of mitigating earthquake losses to \nthe  affected  communities  and  providing  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  priority \ninfrastructure assets.\n\nQuick-Disbursing  Component.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency \n60.\nAssistance Policy, a portion of the proposed Project will be used for quick-disbursing assistance \nto partly finance the unusually high and unexpected expenditures required for rehabilitation and \nreconstruction.  The  Project  will  extend  a  quick-disbursing  component  of  $108  million  (a  $65 \nmillion  grant  from  the  Pakistan  Earthquake  Fund  and  a  $35  million  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources,  and  about  $8  million  in  Government  counterpart  funding  from  taxes  and \nduties).  As  per  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  the  quick-disbursing \ncomponent  will  be  used  to  finance  only  those  imports  identified  as  necessary  for  an  effective \n\n                                                \n3 ADB. 2004.  Disaster and Emergency Assistance. Operations Manual. Sections D7/BP and D7/OP. Manila.\n\n\f12\n\nrecovery program. The Government and ADB have agreed on a list of permissible imports for \nfinancing under the quick-disbursing project facility (Appendix 3). \n\nProject  Sector  Components.  Project  sector  components  will  be  $246.8  million, \n61.\nincluding  $185  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  and  $61.8  million  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s counterpart funding. It will be used to rehabilitate earthquake-damaged education \nand health facilities and other high-priority infrastructure by providing civil works, equipment and \nmaterials,  working  capital,  and  consulting  services  for  project  design,  implementation, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  During  the  rehabilitation  phase,  appropriate  and  cost-effective \ndesign  and  construction  standards  will  be  adopted.  Civil  works  designs  will  follow  a  sector \napproach  and  select  the  highest-priority  subprojects  during  implementation.  This  will  allow  a \nquick  response  and  maximum  flexibility  in  both  geographic  coverage  and  selection  of \ncomponents within the agreed framework and criteria. In consultation with the Government, and \ntaking  into  account  the  assistance  being  proposed  by  other  development  partners,  the  project \nsector  components  will  finance  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  in  the  following  sectors:  (i) \ntransport  with  $140.0  million;  (ii)  power  with  $53.5  million;  and  (iii)  social  sectors,  including \nhealth and education, with $53.3 million. \n\nImplementation  Assistance.  Consulting  services  for  Project  implementation  will  be \n\n62.\nfinanced by $15.0 million in grants from the Pakistan Earthquake Fund. \n\n The legal assistance, governance, and institutional building subcomponent will be $2.5 \n\n63. \nmillion and is included in the $15 million for implementation assistance. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features  \n\n64. \nThe Project will address urgent basic needs and restore social services lost as a result \nof the earthquake. If life in the affected and neighboring areas is to return to normal, transport, \npower  and  social  services  must  be  restored,  destroyed  infrastructure  must  be  rebuilt,  and \naccess to employment opportunities must be made available. The Project has, therefore, been \nprocessed  under  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  Since  interventions  will \ntypically  replace  preexisting  assets,  reconstructed  to  appropriate  technical  and  earthquake-\nresistant  standards,  an  economic  analysis  is  not  required.  Investments  will  be  made  on  the \nbasis of least-cost restoration of preexisting facilities. The procedures for project loan and grant \nprocessing, procurement, consultant engagement, subproject selection, and the type of works to \nbe done reflect this flexibility, without sacrificing quality, transparency, and safeguards. However, \nthe  Project  is  designed  to  ensure  proper  targeting,  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  and \ncommunity participation while addressing area resource and capacity constraints. \n\n65. \nADB  will  focus  on  ensuring  that  the  Project  implementation  is  efficient,  effective,  and \nexpedient. Following the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, additional resources have \nbeen dedicated to implementation, supervision and monitoring, including (i) support for ERRA, \n(ii) provision of resettlement specialists, and (iii) environment specialists to assist environmental \nassessment of earthquake-related projects by the provincial environmental protection agencies.  \n\nThe Project has been prepared through a high consultative, multidonor exercise led by \n66. \nADB  and \nimplementation \narrangements  have  been  harmonized  among  donors,  and  aligned,  to  the  greatest  extent \n\nthe  World  Bank. 4  Needs  assessment,  Project  design  and \n\n                                                \n4 The  World  Bank  is  funding  reconstruction  of  the  National  Highways  through  additional  financing  to  its  ongoing \n\nHighway Rehabilitation Project. \n\n\fpossible,  with  the  prevailing  system  in  Pakistan  in  an  attempt  to  minimize  the  administrative \nburden on the Government. \n\n \n\n13\n\nD. \n\nSector Components \n\n \n\n1. \n\nTransport \n\n67. \nThe  transport  sector  component  of  the  Project  will  rehabilitate  earthquake-damaged \nmajor  roads  and  bridges,  except  national  highways,  within  the  four  affected  districts  in  AJK \n(Bagh, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, and Poonch) and the five affected districts in NWFP (Abbottabad, \nBattagram,  Kohistan,  Mansehra,  and  Shangla).  The  component  will  cover  repairing  and \nrehabilitating  the  damaged  major  roads  and  bridges  under  the  Public  Works  Department  and \nLocal  Government  and  Rural  Development  Department  in  AJK  and  the  Frontier  Highway \nAuthority  (FHA)  and  district  governments  in  NWFP.  Road  clearance  now  in  place  is  not \nanticipated  to  last  beyond  the  coming  snow  season.  More  thorough  and  permanent  road \nrebuilding measures are required, particularly protection works to minimize landslides and river \nerosion  and  improved  drainage  for  slope  stabilization.  Rehabilitation  works  will  restore  roads \nand bridges to the pre-quake or higher standard, as this is considered cost-effective in the long \nrun.  Where  technically  feasible  and  justified,  rehabilitation  will  include  protection  measures  to \nmitigate damage from future landslides. Land acquisition and relocation may be required where \nthe original road cannot be reconstructed and requires partial realignment. The transport sector \nassessment is in Appendix 4. \n\n2. \n\nPower\n\n68. \nThe power sector faired better overall than expected immediately after the earthquake. \nThe  power  companies  responded  quickly  and  restored  the  power  supply  within  days  of  the \nquake.  It  should  be  noted  that  nearly  all  repairs  were  of  a  temporary  nature  and  need  to  be \nreplaced  by  permanent  solutions.  There  are  still  areas  that  have  not  yet  been  inspected \nbecause  damaged  roads  make  access  to  them  not  yet  possible.  In  the  aftermath  of  the \nearthquake,  it  was  necessary  to  establish  tent  villages  and  relief  camps  for  the  dislocated \npopulation. These camps need to be electrified to ensure lighting and security at night, power \nfor  pumping  water,  and  the  efficient  operation  of  schools  and  other  common  facilities. \nTemporary electrification of tent villages and relief camps needs to be funded, and the recurring \ncosts  of  electricity  consumption  in  tent  villages  and  camps  should  be  paid  to  the  supplying \nelectricity distribution companies to ensure their financial sustainability.  \n\n69. \nThe  power  sector  component  comprises  rehabilitation  of  the  power  generation  and \nsupply  system  that  were  damaged  by  the  earthquake.  In  detail,  the  Project  will  cover  (i) \nrepairing the nine hydropower generation stations, including access roads, buildings, equipment \nand ancillary facilities; (ii) supplying and installing equipment and lines related to the 132 kV, 33 \nkV,  and  11  kV  substations;  (iii)  constructing  of  operational  substations  buildings  and  staff \nquarters; (iv) supplying and installing 0.4 kV and 0.22 kV low-voltage lines; (v) installing service \nconnections  to  consumers;  (vi)  providing  spare  parts,  operational  vehicles,  and  tools  (vii) \ninstalling  transformers,  meters,  and  service  connections  to  the  tent  villages  and  relief  camps \nestablished after 8 October 2005; (viii) paying electricity supply for  up to two years to the tent \nvillages  and  relief  camps;  and  (ix)  installing  transformers,  meters,  and  service  connections  to \nthe  anticipated  new  model  villages  to  be  established  for  the  victims  of  the  earthquake.  \nReconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  the  facilities  to  pre-\nearthquake levels or to a higher standard as this is considered cost-effective in the medium to \nlong term. Details of the component are in Appendix 5. \n\n\f14\n\n3. \n\nSocial Sectors\n\n70. \nThe  social  sector  component  will  focus  on  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  selected \nhealth  and  education  facilities  geographically  located  in  the  affected  districts  of  AJK  and \nbenefiting  other  areas  where  affected  people  are  currently  concentrated.  The  health \nsubcomponent to be implemented by the AJK Reconstruction Agency and AJK Department of \nHealth, will include: (i) reconstructing one district hospital and three Tehsil headquarter hospitals, \nincluding wards, operating theatres, outpatient departments, staff quarters and other necessary \nservices; (ii) providing all the essential medical equipment to the hospitals including ambulances \nand  supplies;  and  (iii)  constructing  proper  waiting  areas  with  public  toilets  and  clean  drinking \nwater  for  visitors.  The  education  subcomponent  to  be  implemented  by  the  Reconstruction \nAgency  and  AJK  Department  of  Education  will  include:  (i)  repairing  and  reconstructing  about \n550  partly  and  completely  destroyed  government  middle  schools  buildings  with  improved \nseismic  designs,  latrines  and  office  accommodation;  (ii)  providing  all  essential  furniture  and \nequipment  for  all  the  middle  schools  reconstructed  and  repaired;  (iii)  training  trainers  for \nteachers  training;  and  (iv)  assessing  and  advising  on  school  health  services  for  physical  and \nphysiological  health.  The  social  sectors  assessment  is  in  Appendix  6.  The  AJK  Steering \nCommittee  will  decide  whether  there  is  sufficient  capacity  within  the  line  department  to \nundertake  a  particular  subproject  or  the  implementation  is  to  be  undertaken  through  the \nspecially constituted Reconstruction Agency. \n\nE. \n\nLegal Assistance, Governance, and Institutional Building\n\n71. \nDestruction arising from the earthquake has generated legal and documentary issues for \nearthquake  affected  people,  and  enormously  strained  governmental  administration  and \nresources,  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  local  levels.  The  legal  assistance,  governance,  and \ninstitutional  building  subcomponent  seeks  to  address  these  issues.  The  replacement  of  birth, \ndeath, marriage and disability certificates, property titles, and national identification cards will be \nsupported.  Methods  used  for  replacing  documents  will  include  supporting  the  collection  and \ncoordination  of  data  by  the  relevant  departments  and  offices  and  facilitating  the  connectivity, \ncoordination  and  networking  of  such  information;  it  will  provide  legal  assistance  to  earthquake \naffected victims to help them address legal and documentary issues arising from the earthquake. \nThis  will  include  the  earthquake  legislative  framework  that  is  currently  under  consideration  for \nmaking  special  provision  for  persons  and  property  affected  by  the  earthquake.  It  will  also \nestablish  (if  necessary)  a  decentralized  mechanism  for  earthquake  victims  for  private  dispute \nresolution  and  grievance  review  against  public  officials.  In  addition,  training  and  awareness \nworkshops  will  be  conducted  for  judges,  district  officials,  and  the  public  on  the  potential \nearthquake or disaster emergency related legal issues, disputes or cases that are likely to arise. \nThere  will  also  be  provision  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  government  to  provide  for \nvocational training for women and disabled people who may need to enter the labor market for \nthe first time together with a designed program for post training assistance for finding jobs. \n\n72. \nThe  legal  assistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building  subcomponent  will  support \ntransparency  of  earthquake  and  emergency  assistance,  through  ERRA  by  supporting  the \npublication  in  English,  Pushtoo  and  Urdu,  on  the  internet  and  in  local  newspapers,  as  well  as \nbroadcast on national and provincial television and radio, of (i) modes of earthquake assistance \nfrom the Government, development partners and NGOs; (ii) contract and procurement details in \nrelation  to  earthquake  assistance;  and  (iii)  any  proposed  laws  or  policy  relating  to  earthquake \nassistance.  To  keep  the  public  notified,  these  broadcasts  and  publications  will  be  regularly \nupdated at least every quarter. Assistance will also be provided to the Government to centralize \nthe collection of data on earthquake affected people and earthquake-affected property in order \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nto maximize rehabilitation efforts and minimize duplication of efforts. Details of the component \ncan be found in Appendix 7. \n\nF. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n73. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $374.2  million  equivalent,  including  the \nquick-disbursing  component,  taxes  and  duties  (of  approximately  $18.3  million)  and  interest \nduring  implementation.  The  Government  will  contribute  24%  of  the  estimated  cost  of \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  mainly  in  the  form  of  taxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition, \nrehabilitation, resettlement, and administrative support. As a sector approach is being followed, \nthe  cost  estimates  are  broken  down  by  sectors  (Table  2  and  Appendixes  4\u20136).

The Government advised that it will make the \nloan and the grant proceeds of the Project available to the governments of AJK and NWFP on \nterms and conditions in accordance with the existing policies and practices of the Government \nor  any  changes  approved  by  the  Government\u2018s  Economic  Coordination  Committee  (ECC). \nLikewise,  a  portion  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  Peshawar \nElectricity Supply Company (PESCO) and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) NWFP \non  terms  and  conditions  in  accordance  with  the  existing  policies  and  practices  of  the \nGovernment or any changes approved by the Government\u2019s ECC. The Government will bear all \nforeign  exchange  risk.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  provide  required  counterpart  funds  for \nimplementing  the  Project  in  a  timely  manner  to  the  governments  of  AJK  and  NWFP,  IESCO, \nand PESCO on a grant basis. \n\n\fTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n\n16\n\nSource \n\n \nA.

It  is  likely  that  a  number  of  these \npartners  may  be  willing  to  complement  ADB's  funds  for  this  Project  through  cofinancing.  ADB \nhas  typically  sought  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of  loan  or  grant  funds  from \ncofinanciers  only  when  cofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  In  light  of  the  need  for \nexpediency  and  efficiency  in  ADB's  response  to  the  earthquake  disaster  and  emergency, \nManagement  requests  Board  approval  of  the  administration  of  any  cofinanced  funds  obtained \nfrom  development  partners  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval.  Approval  of  such \ncofinanced funds will be confirmed and approved by Management, and reported to the Board in \naccordance with the standard reporting procedures. This procedure will be adopted only to the \nextent that the additional funds provided by cofinanciers will not materially alter or fundamentally \naffect the objectives, purposes and scope of the existing Project. Any proposed cofinancing that \nwill materially affect the objectives, purpose, or scope of the Project would be processed as a \nmajor  change  of  scope  and  circulated  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project \nAdministration Instructions 5.04 and the usual practice. \n\n77. \nSimultaneously  with  loan  and  grant  negotiation,  ADB  received  indications  from  the \nEuropean Commission (EC) of its interest in providing \u20ac30 million  to finance a part of the Social \nSectors Component. The EC has indicated that its formal commitment to provide such financing \nmay  be  expected  by  the  end  of  2005.  To  avoid  any  Project  delay,  Board  approval  for  the \nadministration of the EC grant is sought. An information paper will be provided to the Board to \ndescribe the impact of EC grant on the financing of the Project when the arrangements with the \nEC are finalized. \n\n78. \nAs described above, EC is prepared to commit to provide cofinancing with ADB, allowing \nADB  to  catalyze  additional  resources  for  the  Project.  For  the  EC  to  participate,  it  requires \n\n                                                \n5  Given the exceptional circumstances of the emergency, it is proposed that ADB fund 80% of the Project costs. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nnondiscrimination  against  all  its  members  in  procurement  processes.  Thus,  while  most  of  the \ninvestments  to  be  supported  by  the  Project  are  expected  to  come  from  within  Pakistan  or  to \ninvolve  some  procurement  from  ADB  member  countries,  to  facilitate  the  EC\u2019s  commitment  to \ncofinance  \u20ac30  million  for  Social  Sectors  Component,  Board  approval  is  sought  to  allow \nprocurement in, and procurement of eligible goods and services from, member countries of the \nEuropean  Union,  including  ADB  nonmember  countries.  This  would  facilitate  maximum  and \nexpeditious  development  and  catalyze  additional  resources  from  development  partners  in  the \ncurrent emergency circumstances. \n\n79. \nThe  request  for  Board  approval  is  being  made  pursuant  to  Article  14(ix)  of  the  ADB \nCharter, which states that the Board may, by a vote of the Directors representing not less than \ntwo  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  approve  procurement  from  ADB \nnonmember  countries  in  appropriate  circumstances. The  Charter  provides  one,  non-exclusive, \nexample  of  what  may  constitute  \u201cappropriate  circumstances\u201d  for  allowing  procurement  in  non-\nADB  member  countries  or  procurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in  ADB  nonmember \ncountries.  It  states  that  the  Charter\u2019s  requirement  that  procurement  occur  only  in  member \ncountries  may  be  lifted  \u201cin  the  case  of  a  nonmember  country  in  which  a  significant  amount  of \nfinancing has been provided to the Bank.\u201d This example is similar to the current proposal. The \nEC is expected to provide a grant of \u20ac30 million, which is a significant contribution to the Social \nSectors  Component.  The  European  Union,  which  is  supporting  the  EC\u2019s  provision  of  such \nfinancing includes ADB members and nonmembers that are together providing this contribution \nby  way  of  joint  cofinancing  for  the  Project.  The  Board\u2019s  approval  for  lifting  the  procurement \nrestriction is being requested only in support of Social Sectors Component of the Project. \n\nI. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\nERRA,  established  through  presidential  decree  in  response  to  the  8  October  2005 \n80. \nmassive earthquake, will be the executing agency for the Project, and MOF will be the executing \nagency  for  quick-disbursing  component.  The  mechanisms  and  implementation  strategies, \ninstitutional framework and related terms of reference for the recovery efforts under the umbrella \nof ERRA are still being developed. Based on the current understanding of ERRA functions, the \nauthority  is  expected  to  facilitate,  guide,  coordinate,  approve,  and  monitor  the  reconstruction \neffort, develop the overall policy and planning framework for the reconstruction effort, standard \nsetting  and  quality  control  and  manage  the  operation  and  accounting  of  the  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction funds. ERRA is also expected to lead revisions of the current arrangements for \nsubproject  approval  implementation  and  fund  flow  to  simplify  procedures  and  so  ensure  quick \nimplementation  and  full  transparency.  As  a  priority,  ERRA  will  develop  and  adapt  appropriate \nearthquake  resistant  designs  and  construction  codes  for  immediate  adoption  by  civil \nconstruction  industry.  ERRA\u2019s  Governing  Council,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  will  approve \noverall  programs  and  large  work  packages,  basically  fulfilling  the  role  of  the  Central \nDepartmental Working Party in normal development projects, but with a much shorter timeframe. \nERRA\u2019s  Board,  chaired  by  ERRA\u2019s  Chairman,  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  project \nthrough provincial and district line agencies following current/revised procedures, on fact track \nbasis.  ERRA  will  also  approve  major  changes  in  scope  and  cost  of  the  subprojects,  annual \nplans,  and  budgets.  It  will  support  Project  implementing  agencies  with  financial  and  technical \nmanagement. The implementing agencies include Reconstruction Agencies in NWFP and AJK, \nIESCO, and PESCO. In addition, the implementing agencies in AJK include the Departments of \nLocal  Government  and  Rural  Development,  Electricity,  Health,  Education,  and  Public  Works. \n\n\f18\n\nThe  implementing  agencies  in  NWFP  include  the  line  department,  five  district  governments, \nFHA, and Sarhad Hydro Development Organization (SHYDO). \n\n81. \nERRA  will  be  staffed  by  various  specialist  professionals  deputed  from  relevant \ngovernment departments (including those of the federal Government and other provinces), and \nhired  from  the  private  sector  as  necessary  for  ERRA  to  carry  out  its  functions.  Periodic  social \nand technical monitoring, regular review and overall fund flow and internal audits of the Project \nwill  be  carried  out  by  ERRA.  The  Controller  General  of  Accounts  (CGA),  AGP  and  MOF  will \nprescribe the related procedures and requirements for fiduciary monitoring. The AJK and NWFP \nimplementing  agencies  will  develop  the  subprojects  following  the  selection  criteria  and  social \ncompliance,  through  public  consultation,  based  on  procedures  outlined  in  Appendix  10  and  to \nbe formalized in an operational manual to be prepared by ERRA.  \n\n82. \nThe  governments  of  AJK  and  NWFP,  through  their  steering  committees  specially \nconstituted  for  the  purpose  of  reconstruction  in  the  quake  affected  areas,  chaired  by  the \nAdditional Chief Secretaries of AJK and NWFP and having representation of ERRA, provincial \nline  departments  and  the  district  governments  (in  case  of  NWFP),  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing  the  provincial  planning  and  implementation  of  subcomponents.  These  committees \nwill  be  supported  by  professionally  staffed  Reconstruction  Agencies  (RA)\u2014the  NWFP \nReconstruction Agency and the AJK Reconstruction Agency, containing various specialist staff, \nwill  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  subprojects  for  which  capacity  does  not  exist  at  with \nprovincial  and  district  line  departments  contracted  as  decided  by  the  respective  steering \ncommittees  of  NWFP  and  AJK.    RAs  will  design  and  approve  subprojects  falling  within  the \npowers delegated to the RA by the provincial Government and within the overall annual budget \nand work plan approved by ERRA. The steering committees and ERRA will approve work plans, \nbudgets and provide overall guidance, in line with emergency procedures to be put in-place by \nERRA  Council  and/or  Board.  For  the  subprojects  implemented  through  the  provincial  line \ndepartments/implementing  agencies,  and  the  district  governments,  where  technical  capacity \nexists  as  decided  by  the  respective  SCs,  additional  support  will  be  provided  by  deputing  staff \nand by appointment of additional expertise as required to meet the additional work load and fast \ntrack  requirements,  due  diligence  and  reporting.  ERRA,  RAs  and  line  departments  staff \nrequirements,  and  related  operating  costs,  will  be  funded  through  incremental  administration \nsupport, supported in part by ADB grant funds.  \n\n83. \nThe  district  advisory  committees  (DACs)/district  development  committees  (DDCs) \nheaded by district coordination officer (DCO) or Nazims in NWFP and deputy commissioners in \nAJK,  will  be  responsible  for  identification  of  subprojects  and  needs,  and  recommend  plans  for \napproval  of  the  steering  committees.  These  plans  will  be  approved  annually  by  the  steering \ncommittees or ERRA and implemented through RA (through their district reconstruction units), \nline  departments  and  district  governments,  as  recommended  by  steering  committees. \nfor  subproject \nImplementing  agencies\u2019  additional \nimplementation, and technical backstopping and technical assistance support for implementing \nagencies  to  plan,  design,  supervise  and  implement  the  subprojects,  will  be  financed  by  the \nprojects.\n\nincremental  staff  and  overhead  cost \n\n84. \nIdentification  of  subprojects  will  be  done  by  respective  implementing  agencies  in \nconsultation  with  the  local  stakeholder,  using  official  records  and  applications  received  from \ncommunities, NGOs and elected representatives, to identify schemes and the sites. Selection of \nsites  and  subprojects  will  be  made  from  the  identified  list  using  a  pre-determined  selection \ncriteria.  The  selected  list  will  be  verified  and  appraised  for  social  compliance  (through  public \nconsultation) by NGOs/specialized agency directly hired by ERRA for the 8 affected districts in \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nthe \n\ntechnical  and  safeguard  appraisal,  before \n\nAJK and NWFP. The RAs of NWFP and AJK, with the assistance of hired consultant teams, will \nundertake \nis  submitted  DAC \nrecommendation/advice  and  approval  of  the  SCs  and  ERRA.  ERRA  Council,  SCs  and \nimplementing  agencies  will  approve  the  subprojects  to  be  executed  by  district/provincial \nagencies,  within  their  approval  limits  and  after  screening  send  the  list  of  subprojects  to  be \nimplemented by federal line agency for their approval. \n\nthe \n\nlist \n\n85. \nIn addition to the incremental staff support and/or consultants hired by the RAs and line \ndepartments of AJK and NWFP, to implement the project components, ERRA will use their own \nstaff and/or hire short term consultants to assist them with due diligence and monitoring and to \nguide implementing agencies in project appraisal, coordination and incorporation of social and \nenvironmental  safeguards.  Consulting  firms  recruited  directly  by  RA  and  line  departments  will \nassist  the  RA,  provincial  line  agencies  and  district  government  (depending  on  the  agency \nimplementing  the  subprojects)  with  design,  processing  approvals,  and  internal  monitoring, \nprocurement, and construction supervision.  \n\nFinancial  Management.  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  manage  the  multidonor \n86.\nConsolidated  Fund  for  Emergency  Earthquake  Assistance  established  in  the  State  Bank  of \nPakistan  (SBP)  through  which  the project  funds  will  flow. ERRA  is  putting  in  place  the  related \nfiduciary  arrangements  to  ensure  transparency  in  the  flow  of  funds,  financial  management, \naccounting, internal control processes, procurement, periodic financial reporting, monitoring and \ninternal  and  external  audits.  The  CGA  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  accounting  and \nreporting  practices  and  requirements.  The  CGA,  MOF  and  AGP  will  provide  the  related \nguidelines,  and  ensure  that  all  relevant  government  statutory  provisions  and  prudential \nregulations are followed. Disbursement of project funds will generally follow existing accounting \nprocedures. The AGP will have the overall responsibility for the audit of earthquake assistance, \nand as such will be responsible for determining the appropriate auditing arrangements and for \nensuring  the  timely  completion  of  audits  and  that  audits  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with \ninternationally accepted auditing practices.    \n\n87. \nThe Project funds will be disbursed through the Consolidated Fund in SBP to the imprest \naccount  operated  by  the  fund  manager\u2014the  MOF  for  the  quick-disbursing  components  and \nERRA for the other components\u2014to finance loan and grant components of the Project. MOF will \nmake  budget  allocation  for  counterpart  funds  in  the  Budget,  and  release  the  Government\u2019s \ncounterpart share as a grant in a separate account operated by the fund manager in the form of \nbudget allocation, as a grant, released from the MOF to ERRA Fund (a special deposit fund in \nPublic  Account\u2014assignment  account).  The  ADB  funds  for  the  Project,  and  Government\u2019s \ncounterpart  funds  will  be  released  to  ERRA  as  executing  agency  (excluding  quick-disbursing \ncomponent, for which MOF will be the EA). ERRA will maintain separate accounts for ADB loan \nand grants (imprested accounts), Government\u2019s counterpart funds and will release funds to the \nrespective  implementing  agencies  (second  generation  imprest  accounts)  as  advances  against \napproved budget/work plan at the federal, provincial and district levels,. All funds will be utilized \nfor  their  intended  purposes  as  per  the  financing  plan,  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  set \ndown  by  CGA  and  ERRA.  ADB  funds  will  be issued  with specified  codes  for  the rehabilitation \nand reconstruction program, and all payments and disbursements will be made based on these \ncodes. The fund flow arrangement is in Appendix 9. \n\n88.\nERRA will provide ADB with quarterly financial and physical progress reports on the use \nof  ADB  and  other  donor  funds,  as  well  as  annually  audited  financial  statements.  Given  the \nmagnitude  of  funds  that  will  pass  through  ERRA  for  implementation,  MOF  had  proposed  that \nERRA  should  establish  periodic  internal  audits  and  reviews  mechanisms,  in  consultation  with \n\n\f20\n\nother donors and ADB. These will provide systemic feedback to improve financial management, \nfund-flow timeliness, accountability and transparency. Project imprest accounts will be operated \nin  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  The  AGP  may \nnominate  private  chartered  accountants,  if  required,  to  meet  the  increased  burden  on  and  to \ndemonstrate transparency.\n\n89. \nAll  donor  funds  channeled  through  ERRA  will  be  subject  to  the  same  operating \nprocedures and processes. The World Bank has completed a preliminary financial management \nassessment,  which  is  available  as  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Based  on  the  preliminary \nassessment,  and  subject \nfinancial  management \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  Project  are \nfound to be satisfactory. \n\nimplementation  and \n\nfinalization  of \n\nto \n\nMonitoring  and Anticorruption  Measures.  ADB  and  other  donors  will  rely  on  the \n90.\nagreed funds-flow mechanism, as well as the periodic disbursement, procurement, and output \nmonitoring  reports  generated  by  ERRA,  to  fulfill  their  assurance  requirements.  A  generic \nperformance  monitoring  system  will  be  established  by  ERRA  in  consultation  with  donor \nagencies,  including  ADB.  This  system  will  take  into  account  the  key  indicators  and  targets \noutlined in the project framework. With the assistance of project-financed consultants, ERRA will \nfacilitate the development of this framework and its implementation plan within 3 months of loan \neffectiveness. Basic damage assessment has already been conducted and information provided \nin this assessment will be updated within 3 months of loan effectiveness to validate the damage \nbaseline.  ERRA  and  provincial  RAs  and  line  departments  will  use  this  baseline  to  undertake \nregular  reviews  and  provide  routine  monitoring  reports,  for  which  the  requirements  and \nstructures  will  be  agreed  with  al  the  donors  by  ERRA  and  provided  in  the  operations  manual. \nMonitoring bodies are envisaged at both the provincial level (including the AJK) and the district \nlevel.  These  will  consist  of  technical,  environmental  and  social  safeguard  specialist;  elected \nrepresentatives and NGOs, who will produce regular monitoring reports and undertake periodic \nreviews of project implementation.  \n\n91. \nApart  from  the  regular  monitoring  framework  and  reporting  requirement  established \nunder ERRA operations, the Project will be reviewed jointly by ERRA and ADB, with frequencies \nand timeframes agreed by ADB and ERRA. The terms of reference of external donor review will \nalso be negotiated and agreed between donors, including ADB, and  ERRA for the purpose of \nconsistency, effectiveness, and efficiency, and also to avoid overloading the agencies involved \nin the reconstruction activity. A comprehensive midterm review planned after the first year of the \nProject  will:  (i)  evaluate  the  project\u2019s  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii) \nassess the effectiveness of implementing agencies, and structure in terms of achieving project \nobjectives  and  targets;  (iii)  evaluate  the  progress  on  contract  awards  disbursement  and \nprocurement,  and  appropriateness  of  the  related  procedures  for  these  aspects  to  achieve \nproject  targets;  (iv)  evaluate  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  monitoring,  safeguard  and \nfund  flow  arrangement;  (v)  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  consultants  and  consultancy \narrangement  in  delivering  project  outputs  and  technical  assistance  terms  of  reference;  (vi) \nidentify changes needed in any or all of the arrangement and components; (vii) identify critical \nissues  and  constraints,  if  any;  and  (viii)  recommend  adjustments  to  the  project  design  and/or \nimplementation  arrangements,  if  necessary.  The  midterm  review  will  identify  any  slow-moving \ncomponent  and  make  recommendations  for  remedial  measures.    Reallocation  of  funds  from \npoorly performing components to better performing components may  be recommended by the \nMidterm Review Mission.  \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \n92. \nand  executing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability, \nand  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nalleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support \nthese  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  Loan  and \nGrant  Regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agencies  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n\n93. \nIn addition, ERRA will publicly disclose on the website for the Project information on how \nthe  funds  are  being  used  for  the  intended  beneficiaries  following  applicable  procedures.  The \nwebsite  will  present  financial  statements  and  track  procurement  contract  awards,  as  well  as \ninclude information on, among other things, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning \nbidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, the list of \ngoods and/or services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.  \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n\n94. \nThe implementing agencies will formulate and propose a list of subprojects through the \nSC  and  line  departments.  The  implementing  agencies  will  conduct  initial  screening  of  the \nproposals  and  submit  these  to  the  provincial  steering  body  for  final  selection  and  approval  in \naccordance  with  general  selection  criteria  for  purposes  of  eligibility  criteria  for  each  project \ncomponent. The general eligibility criteria are listed in Appendix 10.\n\n95. \nThe first two subprojects to be carried out by each implementing agency will be subject \nto  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB  before  commencement.  Any  subsequent  subproject \nexceeding  $500,000  equivalent  but  less  than  $3  million  equivalent  will  be  sent  to  the  relevant \nsteering committee for approval and ADB for information, while subprojects exceeding $3 million \nequivalent  will  require  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB.  Subprojects  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  subject  to  approval  by  the  respective  PDWP  and  random \naudit  and  checks  by  ADB  to  ensure  compliance  with  requirements  of  subproject  selection \ncriteria and the implementation arrangement. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nAs  the  Project  is  for  emergency  assistance,  implementation  will  start  immediately  after \n96. \napproval  and  be  completed  within  36  months. 6 A  detailed  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 11.\n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n97. \nGiven  the  urgent  Project  needs,  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  services  will  be \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under \nthe  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \nand  the  contemplated  implementation  schedule.  ADB  procedures  for  providing  reconstruction \n                                                \n6  The period of 36 months for project implementation was requested by the Government, and is considered justified \nbased on the extreme destruction and dislocation caused by the earthquake of 8 October 2005, and the weakened \nabsorptive  capacity  of  the  country,  particularly  the  provincial  and  district  administrations  of  the  affected  areas, \nfollowing  the  disaster.  The  36-month  implementation  schedule  under  the  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency \nAssistance Policy is considered appropriate.\n\n\f22\n\nassistance after disasters allow maximum flexibility so that project activities can start promptly. \nLocal competitive bidding procedures will be the preferred mode of procurement.  \n\n98. \nGoods and related services estimated at more than $1 million will be procured following \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. International shopping procedures will be followed \nfor procurement of goods and related services estimated at between $100,000 and $1 million. \nFor  small,  specialized  equipment  and  materials  contracts  valued  less  than  $100,000,  direct \nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed.  Due  to  the  urgent  nature  of  this \nProject, the bidding period for international competitive bidding will be shortened to 30 days and \nfor local competitive bidding, to 14 days. \n\n99.   Civil  works  contracts  over  $5  million  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding and those estimated to cost $5 million or less will be procured through local competitive \nbidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Post-qualification  with  single  stage:  two-envelope \nprocedures,  and  usage  of  the  existing  contractor  registration  system  or  contractors  previously \nprequalified  for  works  of  similar  size  and  nature  is  acceptable.  Further,  in  order  to  effectively \nrespond  to  the  urgent  Project  needs,  contracts  estimated  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be \nawarded  to  local  contractors  or  those  contractors  who  are  working  in  the  affected  region  on \ndirect  contracting  basis  at  negotiated  rates  or  at  rates  of  ongoing  contracts.  Civil  works \nestimated  between  $100,000  to  $500,000  may  be  awarded  following  limited  local  competitive \nbidding  procedures  by  inviting  a  limited  number  of  registered  or  qualified  contractors  to \nparticipate in the bidding, including where practicable, the invitation for bids will be advertised in \na national newspaper. ADB will conduct prior review of bidding documents, technical and price \nevaluation reports and award recommendations for all packages estimated to cost $1,000,000 \nand above. For contracts estimated to cost less than $1,000,000, ADB will review and approve \nthe first contracts for each implementing agency/PIU; post-facto approval procedures will follow \nif procurement procedures are satisfactory. However, if ADB determines at a later stage that its \nguidelines were not followed, ADB may not accept the award, or terms, of the contract in which \ncase the Government cannot use loan or grant proceeds to finance the contract. If the loan or \ngrant  proceeds  have  already  been  used  to  finance  such  contracts  at  the  time  of  such \ndetermination,  the  Government  will  refund  to  ADB  any  such  expenditure  incurred.  Rebidding \nand extending bid validity will be subject to ADB prior approval. Community participation in the \nprocurement of small works of a simple nature is encouraged.7\n\n100.  For  the  quick-disbursing  component,  all  items  on  the  positive  list  imported  by  the \nGovernment,  including  packages  procured  by  private  entities  on  behalf  of  the  Government \nfollowing normal local commercial procedures for the private sector and standard Government \nprocurement  procedures  for  the  public  sector  procurement,  where  such  procedures  are \nfunctioning and appropriate and acceptable to ADB, are eligible.  \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n101.  The implementation of the earthquake reconstruction program will more than double the \nnormal level of development activities in NWFP and AJK, putting unprecedented stress on the \nresponsible  agencies.  The  most  efficient  way  to  boost  their  human  and  skills  capacity  is  to \nrecruit experienced consultants. Implementation support will take three forms: (i) legal advisory, \ngovernance,  and  institutional  building  ($2.5  million);  (ii)  incremental  administrative  support  ($5 \n                                                \n7 To  encourage  community  participation  and  use  of  indigenous  materials,  methods  to  incorporate  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  may  be  used  for  rural  and  municipal  infrastructure.  Small  works  contract  with  an \nestimated  cost  of  $20,000  or  less  in  each  case  may  be  awarded  to  community  organizations  in  accordance  with \npractices and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nmillion);  and  (iii)  consulting  services  ($7.5  million).  All  implementation  support  will  be  funded \nfrom ADB grant proceeds. \n\n102.  The decision on consultancy packaging and whether to recruit the specialist consultants \nindividually  or  through  a  firm  will  be  determined  during  the  inception  phase.  The  incremental \nadministrative support will include the cost of staff to strengthen the capacity of ERRA and the \nimplementing  agencies  and  the  PIUs.  These  staff  would  be  a  mixture  of  deputed  government \npersonnel  and  individual  specialist  from  institutes,  private  sector  or  consulting  firms.  It  is \nestimated  that  ERRA  would  require  about  30  such  new  staff,  including  three  international \nadvisors (earthquake seismic/structural, construction manager/planner and safeguard specialist) \nin the first year. The estimated budget is $2.5 million for first year, but decreasing as the initial \ncapacity  building  is  attained.  Since  ERRA  is  responsible  for  overseeing  implementation  by  all \nagencies, not just ADB, it is proposed that ADB will finance about a third of the total cost or $1.7 \nmillion, over the 3-year period.\n\n103.  Similarly,  the  implementing  agencies  will  need  an  estimated  five  specialists,  including \none international construction/procurement specialist, for the first 12 months. As with ERRA, the \nimplementing  agencies  will  support  implementation  of  all  externally  financed  projects.  The \nestimated  cost  is  $0.4  million  per  year  for  3  years  or  $1.2  million  total,  for  each  province. \nProvincial  and  district  line  and  implementing  agencies  will  also  need  capacity  building  in \nconstruction  and  safeguard  aspects  and  support  for  implementation.  It  estimated  that  each \nimplementing  agency  will  require  at  least  four  domestic  specialists  in  project  planning  and \ndesign,  procurement,  construction  management  and  quality  control  and  safeguards.  The \nestimated  cost  of  the  incremental  administration  for  these  implementing  agencies  is  $150,000 \nper year per implementing agency, or $2.1 million in each of NWFP and AJK over the 3 years.  \n\n104. \nIn addition, to the incremental administrative support for the Reconstruction Agencies in \nAJK and NWFP, design and construction supervision consultants are required. The consulting \nservices will consist of about 1,500 person-months.  \n\n105.  All  consulting  firms,  and  individual  international  consultants,  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  Since  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  work  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject  must  be  completed  within  36  months  due  to  the  nature  of  the  Project,  expeditious \nselection and fielding of consultants is necessary. Accordingly, qualified and existing consulting \nservices  on  the  ground  should  be  extended  and  retrofitted  to  address  emergency  needs, \nprovided  that  these  consultants  meet  the  following  conditions:  (i)  appropriate  expertise  for  the \nproposed assignment, (ii) capacity for immediate mobilization, and (iii) satisfactory performance \nin previous projects.8 This arrangement will provide an efficient way to recruit consultants under \nthe  circumstances.  Consulting  services  from  firms  will  also  be  provided  through  quality-  and \ncost-based selection using simplified technical proposals. Individual consultants will be procured \nthrough ADB\u2019s procedures for recruitment of in individual consultants. Since the Project is to be \ncompleted in only 36 months, selection and fielding of consultants must be expeditious. Outline \nterms of reference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n                                                \n8       This  is  in  conformity  with  para.  114  of  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Policy,  which  states:  \u201cDirect  selection, \nnegotiation,  and  hiring  are  desirable  when  justified  to  expedite  technical  services  required  in  emergency \nsituations. Time-consuming competitive bidding processes should be avoided  wherever possible. Qualified and \nexisting consulting services on the ground should be extended and retrofitted to address emergency needs, as in \nthe recent Gujarat earthquake project\u201d. \n\n\f24\n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n106.  Given  the  urgency  of  the  Project,  advance  action  before  the  date  of  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness  was  endorsed  including  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  recommendations  for  awarding \ncontracts for procuring goods, services, and civil works and the recruitment of consultants. The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  such  advance  action  does  not  commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n Implementation  and  Project  Sector  Components.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in \n107.\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001) as amended from time to \ntime  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  Each  executing \nagency and implementing agency, through qualified accounting staff, will prepare disbursement \nprojections,  request  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  maintain  books  of  accounts \nand  supporting  documents  and  prepare  withdrawal  applications.  On \nloan  and  grant \neffectiveness,  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  as  necessary  at  the  National  Bank  of \nPakistan for ERRA and the MOF for the loan and the grant to cover eligible expenditures under \nthe Project. Existing government fund flow arrangements will be used to disburse funds from the \nexecuting agencies\u2019 imprest account down to the district levels.  \n\n108.  The advance to each imprest account will not exceed the lesser of 3 months\u2019 estimated \nproject  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  and  grant  amount.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures  will  be  followed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  accounts  and  to  reimburse  individual \npayments of up to $100,000. The imprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished \nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001)  as \namended from time to time, and with detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB.  \n\n109.  ERRA  will  disburse  funds  directly  for  the  activities  including  (i)  capital  and  operating \ncosts of the ERRA; (ii) consultants, technical support team offices, capacity building and training \nactivities; and (iii) related expenditures for monitoring, review, and evaluations. \n\n110. Quick-Disbursing  Component.  The  quick-disbursing  component  will  be  disbursed \nbased  on  a  list  of  imports  identified  as  necessary  for  an  effective  recovery  program.  The \nproceeds will be disbursed based on certification by the Government that, with regard to imports \nnot  earlier  than  8  October  2005,  the  value  of  the  total  imports,    less  imports  from  ADB \nnonmember  countries, ineligible imports,  and  disbursements  made  by  other  donors,  is  greater \nthan the amounts claimed for disbursements.  \n\n111.  The  Government  will  be  required  to  submit  with  each  withdrawal  request  certification \nconfirming  compliance  with  the  above  formula  in  respect  of  the  period  covered  by  the \nwithdrawal  request.  Disbursements  will  be  in  the  form  of  reimbursement  to  the  Government. \nSupporting  documentation  for  this  component  will  be  limited  to  customs  clearance  documents \nand records of the Department of Customs. For purposes of disbursement, submission of these \ndocuments  will  not  be  required.  However,  these  documents  will  be  audited  during  the  annual \naudit  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  shall  be  provided  on  the  use  of  loan  and  grant  proceeds \nunder the quick-disbursing component. \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n8. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n112.  The Project provides for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures. ADB has agreed \nto  provide  retroactive  financing  of  up  to  30%  of  Project  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  not \nearlier  than  8  October  2005,  provided  that  the  expenditures  are  procured  in  accordance  with \nagreed  procedures.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  provision  of  retroactive  financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n\n113.  The  Government  has  requested,  and  ADB  has  agreed,  subject  to  Board  approval,  to \nfinance on a retroactive basis, the (i) cost of consulting services related to surveys with respect \nto  damage  and  needs  assessment  provided  that  the  consultants  have  been  engaged  in \naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB; and (ii) cost of procurement activities related to \nthe Power Sector Component provided that such activities have been carried out in accordance \nwith procedures acceptable to ADB.  ADB shall have the right to refuse to finance any contract \nthat has been entered into and does not meet ADB\u2019s requirements. \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n114.  Each executing and implementing agency will maintain records and accounts adequate \nto  identify  works,  goods,  and  services  financed  by  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  Specifically, \neach  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency  will  (i)    maintain  separate  accounts  for  the \nProject;  (ii)  ensure  that  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited  annually  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB; and \n(iii)  provide  to  ERRA  for  consolidation  and  delivery  to  ADB,  not  later  than  4  months  after  the \nclose of each fiscal year with certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements and \nthe  report  of  the  auditor  on  these,  including  the  auditors\u2019  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccounts,  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  and  certification  of  imports  (for  the  quick-\ndisbursing  component).  Given  the  relatively  high  degree  of  fiduciary  risk  associated  with  this \nProject, the audited accounts and financial statements will be provided to ADB within 4 months \nof the end of the fiscal year.9\n\n115.  Consistent  with  the  harmonization  and  alignment  agenda,  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and \nother  major  donors  are  attempting  to  harmonize  their  requirements  and  alight  to  the  greatest \nextent  possible,  align  them  with  Pakistan's  own  systems  and  procedures  to  reduce  the \nadministrative burden on the Government. Harmonized accounting and reporting requirements \nshould  improve  both  the  accuracy  and  timeliness  of  financial  reporting.  ADB  will  hold  the \nGovernment of Pakistan accountable that funds will be used in an efficient and effective manner \nand  for  their  intended  purpose.  ADB  will  rely  on  CGA  to  ensure  that  adequate  accounting \nprocedures  and  practices  (including  internal  controls)  satisfactory  to  ADB  are  developed  and \nimplemented,  and  on  AGP  to  ensure  that  audits  are  conducted  in  line  with  internationally \nacceptable auditing practices. ADB will reserve the right to substitute auditors and/or to conduct \nits own audit should irregularities comes to light.10\n\n                                                \n9 The  auditing  requirement  has  been  harmonized  with  that  of  the  World  Bank.  Although  both  institutions  typically \nrequire submission of audited financial statements within 6 months, it was felt that the risks associated with this \ntransaction, together with a 36-month implementation period warranted a slightly tighter deadline for submission. \n10    The World Bank has supported the Project to Improve Financial Reporting and Accounting (PIFRA) in Pakistan. \nUnder this project, the audit component has succeeded in upgrading the audit methodology, depth of compliance \ntesting,  regularity  of  audit  practices,  performance  audit,  audit  reporting  and  audit  report  follow-up.  A  significant \nnumber of auditors has been trained in the use of modern auditing techniques. While audit quality has improved \nmarkedly  with  the  increased  professionalism  of  auditors,  the  timeliness  of  completion  of  the  audit  has  not \nimproved significantly. This has been due primarily to devolution and the need to provide separate audit services \n\n\f26\n\n116.  Each executing agency/implementing agency will prepare quarterly progress reports in a \nformat  acceptable  to  ADB,  which  will  provide  information  on  (i)  progress  made  against \nestablished  targets,  including  pre-identified  monitoring  indicators;  (ii)  delays  and  problems \nencountered, and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) a \nproposed  program  of  activities  for  the  next  quarter.  ERRA  will  consolidate  the  reports  of  all \nimplementing agencies and deliver them to ADB. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject,  each  implementing  agency  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  and  submit  it  to \nERRA for delivery to ADB. \n\n10. \n\nEnvironmental Assessments and Monitoring\n\n117.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  as  the  primary  focus  is  on  rehabilitation  of  existing  social \ninfrastructure.  The  Project  has  been  designed  and  will  be  flexibly  implemented  following  a \nsector  loan  modality.  Unlike  a  sector  project,  the  proposed  Project  has  no  sample  subproject \nselected  at  present,  due  to  its  emergency  nature,  and,  therefore,  no  sample  subproject  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE).  The  Project\u2019s  IEE  provides  overall  preliminary  scoping  and \nhighlights  potential  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  to  be  further  explored \nduring  subproject  formulation.  The  Project\u2019s  IEE  includes  also  the  environmental  assessment \nand  review  framework  (EARF),  which  provides  a  set  of  guidelines  on  how  the  environmental \nassessment  for  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  reviewed.  The  summary  of  project  IEE \nincluding the EARF is attached in Appendix 14. \n\n11. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n118.  A performance monitoring system, satisfactory to ADB will be established, based on the \nkey  indicators  and  targets  outlined  in  the  project  framework.  With  the  assistance  of  project \nfinanced consultants, ERRA will develop comprehensive project performance monitoring system \n(PPMS)  procedures  and  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Monitoring \nSystem Handbook within 9 months of loan effectiveness. The PPMS procedures, performance \nindicators, and their targets will be reviewed and approved by ADB. Benchmark surveys will be \nconducted  before  project  implementation.  With  the  help  of  its  consultant,  ERRA  will  then \nundertake every 6 months quantitative and qualitative project-performance monitoring for each \nproject  component  to  evaluate  the  delivery  of  planned  facilities  and  the  project  benefits  that \naccrued. The RAs and other implementing agencies will assist ERRA in collecting baseline data \nand carrying out PPMS activities. \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n119.  Given  the  relatively  high  degree  of  fiduciary  risk  associated  with  this  Project,  and  the \nextraordinary challenges over the Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) and the office \nof  the  Controller  General  of  Accounts  (CGA),  which  are  created  by  this  Project  as  well  as  by \nother  donor  Projects,  ADB  will  ensure  that  these  agencies  will  be  provided  with  adequate \nresources to meet their fiduciary responsibilities. A TA for $2 million to be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program,  titled  Capacity  Building  for  the  Office  of  the  Auditor \nGeneral of Pakistan,  will assist AGP and CGA to support ERRA to ensure that (i) all executing \n\n                                                                                                                               \n\nto the district governments. Now that the district audit infrastructure is in place, AGP is better placed to complete \naudits  in  a  timely  fashion.  Through  PIFRA,  the  Government  is  adopting  international  best  practice  in  auditing, \nand AGP is moving further into areas such as performance and risk-based auditing. \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nand  implementing  agencies  receiving  earthquake  funds  maintain  auditable  accounts;  (ii) \nfinancial, compliance and performance audits are conducted by the newly established Director \nGeneral Audit ERRA wing of the AGP in accordance with International Organization of Supreme \nAudit Institutions standards; and (iii) ERRA performance monitoring and evaluation systems are \ncoherent  and  provide  information  to  enable  timely  preparation  of  reports  for  management  and \ndonors and ensure that implementation lessons inform policy makers. \n\n120.  The  TA  includes  provision  of  192  person-months  domestic  and  9  person-months \ninternational  consultants.  Consultants  will  provide  training  and  technical  advice  in  various \naspects of audit, accounts and performance monitoring and evaluation. The terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 18. The AGP and CGA will be the executing agencies for the TA. \nThe proposed TA is scheduled to be implemented for 36 months from January 2006 to January \n2009.  Administration of the proposed TA will be delegated to ADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission. \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Poverty Impacts \n\n121.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  regenerate  the  economy, \nrehabilitate  public  infrastructure  and  utilities,  and  generate  employment.  It  will  help  restore \naccess  to  public  infrastructure  and  services.  The  priority  given  to  providing  unskilled  work  to \naffected  people,  including  women,  will  be  an  important  intervention  for  people  who  cannot \nreestablish their livelihoods and are living in temporary shelters. \n\n122.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  and  lost  infrastructure,  particularly  roads  and  power \nsystems,  will  improve  the  quality  of  life,  revive  industry  and  agriculture,  and  facilitate  affected \nhouseholds\u2019 reconnection to the rest of the country. Support for physical reconstruction in key \nsectors like education and healthcare will have positive effects on enhancing human capital and \nprotecting the vulnerable.  \n\n123. \nIn addition, rehabilitation works that entail clearing debris with labor on a cash-for-work \nbasis, and rebuilding basic infrastructure using appropriate labor-intensive methods, can create \nboth  temporary  and  permanent  jobs  for  the  poor.  The  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  evident \nthrough  economic  rehabilitation  arising  from  the  speedy  reconstruction  of  infrastructure  and \nfacilities and livelihood restoration in the earthquake-affected areas. \n\n124.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. \n\nB. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n125.  The earthquake has been as much a socioeconomic disaster for individual households \nas  a  disaster  affecting  physical  infrastructure.  About  2.8  million  people,  out  of  the  total \npopulation of 5 million in the affected areas, were left homeless. Many have lost all their basic \nnecessities for survival, including clothing and household essentials. Since damage is unusually \nbad in certain villages and towns, the percentage of households affected locally will be markedly \nhigher,  implying  that  a  higher  percentage  of  people  have  entered  the  ranks  of  the  poor.  The \n\u201cnew poor\u201d will also come from the most vulnerable and marginalized groups, both socially and \neconomically.  Considering  the  extent  of  the  damage,  the  cost  of  rebuilding  houses  and \ninfrastructure  is  exorbitant  both  for  affected  households  and  for  the  state.  Support  in  terms  of \nfinancial assistance and the introduction of improved earthquake-resistant technology will be of \nconsiderable benefit in protecting both the old poor and the new from sinking further into poverty. \n\n\f28\n\n126.  The  legal  assistance,  governance,  and  instititutional  building  subcomponent  will  also \noffer  a  great  opportunity  to  tackle  some  major  social  issues,  such  as  gender  and  other \nvulnerabilities, legal discrimination and cultural marginalization. Legal constraints may be lifted \nto  face  the  emergency  and  set  ground  for  further  changes.  Creating  an  environment  that  is \nconducivefor vulnerable and marginalized groups in the earthquake-affected areas to participate \nfully in reconstruction activities is an urgent need. Orphans, wives of the missing, single heads \nof  households,  and  widowers  have  to  deal  with  transformations  in  their  social  roles  that  place \nnew burdens on them. Helping them to become economically independent and to improve the \nwell-being  of  their  families  involves  reducing  existing  inequalities  and  discrimination.  To  this \nend, a gender action plan is presented in Appendix 16. \n\nC. \n\nResettlement Issues \n\n127.  As reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads, power, health, and education infrastructure \nwill  be  done  mostly  at  their  original  locations,  no  major  resettlement  impacts11 are  envisaged \nunder  the  Project.  The  need  for  involuntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  in  a  specific \nsubproject area will be known only during project implementation, when site-specific plans are \navailable for subprojects. However, improvement of existing facilities or new construction could \nrequire  land  acquisition  and  relocation.  Moreover,  relocation  of  households  and  communities \nmay take place where severely affected locations are specifically declared by authorities as too \nhigh-risk  to  allow  rehabilitation.  A  measure  of  voluntary  resettlement  may  also  be  expected  in \nplaces  affected  by  major  landslides,  or  where  affected  people  have  been  either  squatters  or \nrenters.  In  some  affected  districts  of  NWFP,  a  few  big  landlords  employ  large  numbers  of \ntenants  to  cultivate  their  land  on  long-term  leases.  Such  land  tenure  arrangements  will  need \ncareful  examination  to  develop  fair  compensation  and  relocation  entitlements.  In  addition,  the \npermanent  or  temporary  removal  of  squatters  from  road  rights-of-way  could  generate \nresettlement impacts on them. Another issue is how to re-establish the property rights of those \nwho  were  temporarily  displaced  by  the  earthquake,  as  most  of  them  enjoyed  only  user  rights \nover  the  land  on  which  they  earned  their  living  as  cultivators  and  shepherds.  The  death  of \nhousehold  heads  could  similarly  generate  difficulties  for  their  surviving  household  members  in \nre-establishing  ownership  over  destroyed  or  damaged  household  property.  The  principal \nentitlements of those who will be affected by subprojects are listed in the entitlement matrix of \nthe resettlement framework (Appendix 15). A subproject involving resettlement impacts will be \napproved  by  ADB  only  after  the  executing  and/or  implementing  agency  submits  a  satisfactory \nresettlement  plan  for  the  subproject,  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  resettlement \nframework.\n\nD. \n\nIndigenous Peoples Issues \n\nIn  NWFP,  some  of  the  earthquake-affected  communities  are  tribal.  Tribes  typically \n128. \ndominate  the  areas  they  occupy  and  participate  in  the  mainstream  economic  and  political \nactivities. Tribal people are well represented in mainstream public institutions, the civil service, \nand  educational  institutions.  The  social  inequality  and  vulnerability  of  most  such  people  thus \narise  from  economic  differentiation  rather  than  from  social  exclusion  or  cultural  differences.  In \nthe  earthquake-affected  areas,  for  example,  land  is  owned  by  a  few  large,  powerful  tribal \nfamilies.  They  rent  out  their  land  to  members  of  the  same  tribe  or  sub-tribe  to  cultivate  crops \n\n                                                \n11    Resettlement impacts are \u201csocial and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are (i) caused by \nacquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on land as \na result of an ADB operation\u201d (F2 OM/BP).  \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nand  to  raise  livestock.  All  of  them  will  certainly  benefit  from  the  rehabilitation  of  roads,  power \nsystems,  and  social  services  such  as  education  and  health  facilities  that  were  destroyed  or \ndamaged by the earthquake.  \n\n129.  A  social  assessment12 will  be  conducted  focusing  on  the  potential  vulnerability  of  all \naffected  groups,  including  tribal  people,  to  ensure  effective  consultations  and  that  culturally \nappropriate benefits reach each such affected group, instead of focusing only on groups defined \nas indigenous peoples. As part of this assessment, the executing and implementing agencies of \neach subproject will examine the vulnerabilities of all groups in terms of potential exclusion from \nproject benefits, negative project impacts, if any, and the need for specific culturally compatible \nmechanisms for participation (e.g., for women and the permanently disabled). If such exclusions \nare  found  in  the  subproject  area,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  incorporate \nadequate  measures  in  subproject  design  to  address  such  vulnerabilities.  If  land  acquisition  or \nrelocation becomes necessary, people\u2019s entitlements will be ensured by the subproject through \nits  resettlement  plan,  which  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  approved  resettlement \nframework. This is the most appropriate and efficient approach to rebuild and reconstruct  \n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n \n\n130.  The Project\u2019s IEE indicates that the Project is not expected to have significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts. What adverse environmental impacts the Project will likely have will be \nlimited mostly to the construction stage. These impacts will be reversible, short term, affecting \nonly  a  limited  area,  and  therefore  manageable.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  that \nsubprojects  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  requirements \nwill  carry  them  out  prior  to  their  approval.  It  is  also  necessary  that  the  environmental \nmanagement plan for each subproject be strictly implemented. \n\nF. \n\nSustainability \n\n131.  A  key  selection  criteria  for  subprojects  to  be  financed  through  the  Project  will  be  an \nassessment  of  financial  sustainability.  This  will  include  an  assessment  of  availability  of \ncounterpart  financing  for  implementation  purposes  as  well  as  for  future  incremental  recurrent \ncosts.  Based  on  these  arrangements  and  given  the  current  macroeconomic  environment,  the \nProject is felt to be financially sustainable. \n\nG. \n\nRisks, Mitigation Measures, and Assumptions \n\n132.  Major risks associated with this emergency project include \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nphysical  risks  due  to  aftershocks  causing  further  damage  to  already  weakened \nstructures and infrastructure and land slides could cause delays in restoration of \nservices and reconstruction. The upcoming snow fall will lead to snow melt and \nrunoff in spring and summer seasons which could trigger further land slides and \nerosion, potentially damaging reconstructed infrastructure; \nlocations  and  difficult \nthe  remote \nlogistically difficult and will lead to longer time frames; \n\ntopography  makes  any  reconstruction  \n\n                                                \n12     The  World  Bank  has  planned  to  conduct  a  similar  social  assessment  in  the  affected  areas  prior  to  formulating \nplans  for  subprojects.  During  implementation,  however,  attention  will  be  given  to  bakarwals,  or  nomadic  tribes \nthat periodically migrate into the affected areas. \n\n\f30\n\n(iii) \n\nthe high elevations in some of the areas means that there is heavy snow cover \nand  low  temperatures  during  winter  months,  which  means  that  reconstruction \nmust  take  place  mostly  during  summer  months,  leading  to  longer  than  normal \nelapsed time to complete  works; \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  massive  relief  operations  and  temporary  housing  camps  could  hinder/delay \nreconstruction,  especially  in  the  vicinity  of  the  larger  towns,  in  order  to  relocate \npeople to make room for reconstruction work; \nlack of available land for new rights of way, could delay access  by contractors to \nwork sites; \nlack  of  human  capacity  of  NWFP  and  especially  AJK  local  governments  due  to \nloss  of  much  of  their  own  buildings  and  facilities,  and  many  staff,  and  lack  of \nexperience  with  externally \nthe  due  diligence \nrequirements;\n\nfunded  projects,  especially \n\n(vi) \n\n(viii) \n\n(vii)  weakened capacity of local consultants and contractors and more specifically the \nterm  could  undermine \n\nin \n\nthe  short \n\nthese  capacities \n\noverstretching  of \nimplementation; \nthe World Bank fiduciary assessment has concluded that the fiduciary risk high, \ngiven  the  complexity  of  funds  flow  arrangements,  the  multi-sector,  multi-\ngovernment  nature  of  the  Project,  nascent  stage  of  ERRA  (including  lack  of \nfinancial  management  capacity),  and  weak  auditing  capacity  and  potential  for \nmismanagement of funds and corruption; \nlack of financial capacity of NWFP and AJK and the electrical companies to meet \nthe 25% counterpart funding requirement, and need to budget for sufficient funds \nto properly operate and maintain the new facilities; and \nERRA  is  a  new  agency  and  while  it  has  extraordinary  authority  to  implement \nreconstruction quickly it has no experience.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n133.  Physical  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  relocating  roads,  bridges,  electrical  lines,  human \nhabitations, and other infrastructure away from the existing and potentially unstable slopes and \nnew slide areas. ERRA will conduct detailed seismic evaluations to determine alternate routes \nand  locations.  All  new  facilities  will  incorporate  earthquake  strengthening  and  other  damage- \nmitigation measures. The logistics of access and climate will be addressed through prioritization \nof  reconstruction  requirements  so  that  for  this  emergency  loan,  only  those  works  that  can \nrealistically be completed in the 3 years timeframe are included. Works with longer timeframes \nwill  be  scheduled  under  the  longer  term  reconstruction  programs  that  the  Government  is  also \npreparing, which could be financed in part by future ADB loans.  \n\n134.  Many  of  the  existing  relief  camps  will  be  dismantled  by  next  summer  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s housing program progresses and people go back to their villages to rebuild their \nhomes.  But  many  will  need  to  remain  for  at  least  18\u201324  months,  while  new  urban  areas  are \nplanned and developed and basic infrastructure installed. These camps will be consolidated and \nlocated in areas of available government land. ERRA is already locating government lands for \ndevelopment as new town sites within a reasonable distance of existing urban development, to \nenable  lower  population  densities  in  the  larger  towns.  Land  acquisition  will  be  from  existing \ngovernment land as much as possible. ERRA has been vested with adequate authority to follow \nemergency  land  acquisition  procedures,  which  will  only  take  a  couple  of  months.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  frameworks  for  resettlement  and  environmental \nimpact.                                                  \n\n135.  ERRA  has  been  provided  with  extraordinary  authority,  through  the  very  high  level \nCouncil, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The capacity of ERRA, the P&D and the line \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nagencies  of  the  provinces  and  the  two  electrical  companies  will  be  strengthened  through \nprovision of in house specialists that will be deputed or hired from other government agencies, \ninstitutes and the private sector, including some foreign experts to assist in the first year of the \nproject.  In  addition  adequate  consulting  services,  through  private  consulting  firms,  will  be \nrecruited  by  the  implementing  agencies  to  support  the  various  provincial  and  district  line \nagencies with all aspects of implementation.  \n\n136. \nImplementation  and  fiduciary  risks  related  to  capacity  for  timely  delivery  of  quality \nsubprojects  in  the  various  project  sectors  will  be  mitigated  in  several  ways.  First,  detailed \nsubproject criteria will be developed, in addition to general subproject selection criteria already \nagreed  to.  Second,  in  terms  of  implementation,  specific  monitoring  mechanisms  will  include \nregular financial audits as well as regular design and construction supervision and performance \naudits  through  random  audits  and  special  post-completion  audits.  To  undertake  such \nsupervision and performance auditing, ERRA will be supported by the dedicated provincial units \nof ERRA and specialized consulting inputs. ERRA will have a strong governance framework that \nwill  combat  corruption  risks  and  to ensure  that  the  assistance  reaches the  intended  victims  of \nthe  earthquake.  These  include  (i)  ERRA/provinces  to  ensure  equitable  and  transparent \ndistribution  of  rehabilitation,  including  beneficiary  identification  and  publishing  a  computerized \nlist  of  affected  people;  (ii)  transparency  in  procurement  (iii)  field  monitoring  through  the  line \nagencies and their consultants/NGOs; and (iv) financial control mechanisms by ERRA and the \nprovinces.\n\n137.  As the nature of this Project demands that the response be rapid, the flow of funds will \nalso  need  to  be  rapid.  However,  ERRA  is  a  newly  created  organization,  with  no  experience, \nwhich  is  nevertheless  expected  to  follow  existing  procedures  and  fast-track  them.  To  ensure \nmitigation of the risk of corruption and mismanagement of funds, extensive and comprehensive \nfiduciary arrangements will need to be put in place. Fiduciary risks will be further mitigated by (i) \nstrengthening the financial management capacity of ERRA and the implementing agencies, (ii) \ndeveloping financial management procedures as part of the operations manual to be prepared \nin advance of disbursement against sector components; and (iii) a shortened auditing deadline. \n\n138.  The  weakened  capacity of  local consultants  and  contractors  will  be  addressed  through \nERRA by associating them with international consultants and contractors where possible for on-\nthe-job training and capacity building. \n\n139.  The provinces and the electrical distribution companies will need budgetary support from \nthe central Government to meet their 25% counterpart funds. Because of the massive damage \nmany revenue sources for the provinces have been reduced and they have extensive additional \nexpenditures due to the damaged infrastructure. Similarly, the central Government will have to \nsupport the provinces with funds for operation and maintenance of the reconstructed facilities, \npower systems, schools and hospitals and other basic services, at least in the short term until \nprovincial and electric company revenues can be restored to sustainable levels. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n140. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:     \n\n\f32\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nThe Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all \nsubprojects are properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of  required \ncounterpart funds are made and released in a timely manner to governments of \nAJK and NWFP, and that these counterpart funds are in addition to the ongoing \ndevelopment program of each of governments of AJK and NWFP. Governments \nof AJK and NWFP will provide such counterpart funds to respective implementing \nagencies in a timely manner. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  within  one  month  of  the  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness, the project implementation agreement in the format acceptable to \nADB  is  signed  between  (a)  NWFP  and  SHYDO;  (b)  NWFP  and  FHA;  and  (c) \nNWFP and each of the district governments; (d) NWFP and NWFP RA; and (e) \nAJK and AJK RA. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  executing  agencies  and  implementing \nagencies  actively  seek  community  participation  in  the  selection,  design,  and \nimplementation  of  all  works  carried  out  under  the  Project.  To  that  extent,  a \nprovision  will  be  included  in  all  tender  documents  that  contractors  will  give \npreference to local labor, where applicable. For works that can be done by both \nmale  and  female  workers,  female  workers  will  be  given  equal  opportunities  to \nemployment.  The Government will ensure that for all activities carried out under \nthe Project, the principle of equal pay for work of equal value will be applied. \n\nGovernments of AJK and NWFP will ensure that the facilities provided under the \nProject are operated and maintained appropriately, and that adequate budgetary \nand other resources are provided for operation and maintenance.  \n\nGovernment of AJK will ensure that all the equipment can be operated soon after \nprocurement  and  training,  all  vacant  posts  in  the  tehsil  and  district  hospitals \nunder  health  sector  subcomponent  are  filled  immediately  after  the  Project \nactivities start in those hospitals, and paramedical staff is provided opportunities \nto work in the remote areas. \n\n(vii)  Government  of  AJK  will  ensure  that  for  the  equipment  to  be  procured  under \nhealth  sector  subcomponent,  operators  and  technicians  are  assigned,  or  post \ncreated and filled at the time of placing the order for that equipment. \n\n(viii)  Government  of  AJK  will  ensure  that  positions  required  to  meet  the  staffing \nrequirement are in place before the start of any subproject in accordance with the \nGovernment of AJK\u2019s existing rules on teacher-student ratio. \n\nGovernment of AJK will  ensure that the recurring and operational budget for all \nschools to be reconstructed under the Project will be provided by the government \nof AJK from its annual recurring budget. \n\nThe Government agrees to provide legal facilitation and assistance to earthquake \nvictims  for  accessing  legal  entitlements  and  to  help  them  to  address  issues  of \nlegal  entitlement  arising  from  the  earthquake,  including  an  earthquake  legal \n\n\f \n\n33\n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nframework  that  will  be  adopted  for  making  special  provision  for  persons  and \nproperty affected by the earthquake and vulnerable people. \n\nThe Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigation measures in \naccordance with (a) the Government\u2019s environmental regulations and (b) ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  are  incorporated  into  all  subproject  designs  and \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthe  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts of any \nsubproject  is  implemented,  and  in  the  event  that  unexpected  impacts  occur, \nremedial measures are prepared in consultation with ADB. The Government will \nensure that the agreed environmental assessment review framework is applied in \nselecting subprojects; that a subproject for which an environmental assessment \nstudy is required has such required study completed and a subproject for which \nGovernment environmental clearance is required obtains such clearance prior to \nthe award of any contracts for that subproject.  \n\nthat \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible,  subprojects  will  avoid \nland  acquisition  and  involuntary  relocation.  In  the  event  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary relocation is required for any subproject, the Government will prepare \na  resettlement  plan  (RP)  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws \nand  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the \nagreed Resettlement Framework; and submit it to ADB for  review and  approval \nbefore  land  acquisition  is  initiated.  The  RPs  will  be  disclosed  to  all  affected \npersons in their own languages and the Project reporting will provide information \non land acquisition and resettlement. \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  each  of  the  agreed  Gender  Action  Plan  and \nVulnerable People Action Plan is implemented and that adequate resources are \nallocated for this purpose in a timely manner.  \n\n(xiv)  The  Government  through  ERRA  will  publicly  disclose  on  the  website  for  the \nProject  information  on  how  the  funds  are  being  used  for  the  intended \nbeneficiaries  following  applicable  procedures.  The  website  will  present  financial \nstatements and  track  procurement  contract  awards,  and  include  information  on, \namong  others,  status  of  earthquake  damages  and  casualties,  subproject \nselection  criteria,  information  on  funding  commitment  by  donors,  the  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures  adopted,  amount  of  the  contract  awarded,  the  list  of  goods  and/or \nservices  purchased,  and  their  intended  and  actual  utilization.  Likewise,  national \nand  provincial/AJK  news  papers  in  English,  Pushtoo,  and  Urdu  will  carry  such \ndetails on a regular basis, at least once a month. Similarly, television and radio \nbroadcasts  will  be  made  in  these  language  broadcasts  at  national  and \nprovincial/AJK levels giving these same details.  \n\n(xv) \n\nThe Government will ensure that proper accounting and audit procedures are in \nplace  to  ensure  efficient  and  economic  use  of  the  ADB  financing  proceeds. \nAccounts and financial statements in relation to the Project and the subprojects \nwill be maintained and certified by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The \nGovernment,  executing  agencies  and  implementing  agencies  will  allow  ADB \nrepresentatives to carry out spot or random checks on the flow of funds through \nthe  imprest  accounts.  The  Government,  executing  agencies  and  implementing \n\n\f34\n\nagencies  will  allow  independent  auditors,  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  undertake \nperformance audits on a random basis to review, among others, implementation \nof  (a)  the  Gender  Action  Plan;  (b)  the  Vulnerable  People  Action  Plan;  and  (c) \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. The Government will also ensure that \npost  completion  audit  is  conducted  by  the  independent  auditors,  acceptable  to \nADB soon after the completion of the Project.  \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Grant and Loan Effectiveness \n\n141.

The state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir \n(AJK)  and  the  eastern  part  of  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  were  dealt  the  most \nserious blow and have suffered extensive damage to economic assets and infrastructure, with \nsocial  service  delivery,  commerce,  and  communications  either  debilitated  or  destroyed.  \nVulnerable  groups,  mainly  women  and  children  living  in  inaccessible  mountain  areas  with  low \nincome and little service provision, have borne the brunt of the earthquake\u2019s impact. \n\n2. \nIn  addition  to  the  enormous  human  toll,  the  earthquake  and  its  aftermath  will  pose  a \nlarge  cost  to  Pakistan.  The  overall  cost  associated  with  the  earthquake  is  estimated  at \napproximately  $5.2  billion,  which  includes  the  estimated  costs  of  relief,  livelihood  support  for \nvictims, and reconstruction (Table A2.1).\n\nTable A2.1:  Overall Costs of the Earthquake \n\nCategory \n\nRelief \nDeath and Injury Compensation \nEarly Recovery \nRestoration of Livelihoods \nReconstruction  \n\nOf Which Short-Term Reconstruction  \nOf Which Medium/Long-Term Reconstruction  \n\n450 \n3,053 \n\nTotal \n\n \nNote: Excludes indirect losses (income) of $576 million (see Table A2.2) \nSources:  Relief,  Death  and  Injury  Compensation  and  Early  Recovery  (UN \nAgencies),  Reconstruction  and  Restoration  of  Livelihoods  (Asian  Development \nBank/World Bank Assessment Team). \n\n5,198\n\n \n\n \n\n$ Million\n1,092 \n205 \n301 \n \n97 \n  3,503 \n \n \n\n3. \nPreliminary  estimates  of  the  direct  damage  sustained  from  the  earthquake  total \nPRs135.1 billion ($2.3 billion), as presented in Table A2.2. These estimates are based on the \nbook  value  of  the  assets.  The  largest  component  of  this  damage  is  to  private  housing,  which \namounts  to  PRs61.2  billion  ($1.03  billion),  followed  by  damage  to  the  transport  sector  totaling \nPRs20.2  billion  ($340  million)  and  to  the  education  sector  equaling  PRs19.9 billion  ($335 \nmillion).  Direct  damage  to  agriculture  and  livestock  is  also  sizeable,  totaling  PRs12.9  billion \n($218 million). Losses to industry and services amount to PRs8.6 billion ($144 million).\n\n4. \nDirect  damage  is  higher  in  AJK  than  in  NWFP.  For  AJK,  it  amounts  to  PRs76.4  billion \n($1.3  billion)  and  for  NWFP,  PRs56.4  billion  ($950  million).  In  most sectors,  the destruction of \nphysical assets in AJK is higher than in NWFP, as is its monetary value.  \n\n5. \nThe indirect losses are PRs34.2 billion ($576 million) and comparable in absolute values \nbetween  NWFP  and  AJK.  The  estimated  indirect  losses  do  not  take  into  account  the  effect  of \nrehabilitation and reconstruction activities on future output. Reconstruction will not only restore \nphysical  assets,  but  also  lead  to  renewed  production  of  goods  and  services.  Hence,  the \nestimates of indirect losses presented above are likely to be on the high side for output losses. \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n                          Table A2.2: Preliminary Estimate of Total Losses and Reconstruction Costs  \n\n \n\nas of 10 November 2005 \n\nDirect\nDamage \n(PRs million)\n\nIndirect \nLosses \n(PRs million)\n\nReconstruction \nCostsa\n(PRs million) \n\nReconstruction \nCosts a\n($ million)  \n\nSector\n\nA.

A substantial portion of these costs is for housing reconstruction, \nwhich will cost an estimated PRs92 billion ($1.6 billion). A breakdown of reconstruction costs by \nsector  is  presented  in  Figure  A1.  Reconstruction  costs  are  valued  at  improved  standard \nreplacement rate that includes the cost of rebuilding to earthquake-resistant standards suitable \nto  local  conditions.  This  is  necessary  given  the  high  degree  of  exposure  to  future  natural \ndisasters in the affected areas. \n\n\fFigure A2: Reconstruction Cost by Sector \n(Total: PRs208 billion; $3.5 billion) \n\nEducation ($472 \nmillion)\n\nEnvironment\n($151 million) \n\nPublic administration \n($72 million) \n\nTransport ($416 \nmillion)\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n41\n\nWater Supply and \nSanitation ($32 million)\n\nIrrigation ($10 million)\n\nEnergy, Power and \nFuel ($40 million) \n\nAgriculture and \nLivestock ($300 \nmillion)\n\nIndustry and Services \n($155 million)\n\nHealth  ($303 million)\n\nPrivate Housing \n($1,552 million) \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nLIST OF PERMISSIBLE IMPORTS \n\nNo. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                       Description \n\nList of General Imports for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction \n\nI.  \n\n1.  \n2.  \n\n3.  \n4.  \n5.  \n6.  \n7.  \n \n8.  \n9.  \n\nNatural rubber latex, natural rubber and similar natural gums \nSynthetic  rubber  latex,  synthetic  rubber  and  reclaimed  rubber;  waste  and  scrap  of \nunhardened rubber \nCork (natural, raw, and waste, including natural cork in blocks or sheets) \nFuel wood (excluding wood waste) and wood charcoal \nPulpwood (including chips and wood waste) \nOther wood in the rough or roughly squared \nPulp and waste paper (except: 251.1, waste paper and paperboard;  \nscrap articles of paper or of paperboard fit only for use in papermaking) \nCotton \nJute and other textile bast fibers, raw or processed but not spun; tow and  waste  thereof \n(including pulled or garneted rags or ropes) \n\n \n\n \n\nIron ore and concentrates \n\n10.

The  Public  Works  Department  (PWD)  is \nresponsible  for  the  4,440  km  paved  and  fair-weather  roads  and  the  Local  Government  and \nRural  Development  Department  (LGRDD)  manages  the  local  roads  that  are  the  tertiary  links \nconnecting  villages  to  the  existing  road  network.  The  road  network  in  the  three  earthquake-\naffected  districts  is  5,305  km  of  which  2,545  km  are  managed  by  PWD  and  2,760  km  is  the \nresponsibility of LGRDD.  \n\n2. \nIn North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), the road network consists of about 9,100 km of \nprovincial highways, secondary roads and rural roads. About 5,000 km of these roads are paved. \nThe  Frontier  Highway  Authority  (FHA)  is  responsible  for  the  2,100  km  of  provincial  highways \nthat connects all districts and provide links to the neighboring provinces. The remaining 7,000 \nkm of roads are managed by the 24 district governments. In the five affected districts, the road \nnetwork  is  6,034  km  of  which  549  km  of  provincial  highways  are  under  FHA  and  the  rest  are \nwith the districts. Three national highways serve as the primary corridor to the affected districts \nin NWFP. Managed by the NHA, these highways have a total length of about 270 km.  \n\nB. \n\nDamage and Impact of the Earthquake \n\nDue  to  the  mountainous  terrain  in  AJK  and  northern  areas  of  NWFP,  access  to \n3. \npopulation  centers  is  by  roads  carved  along  mountainsides.  The  earthquake  damage  to  these \nroads  was  primarily  caused  by  landslides.  Five  types  of  damages  were  observed:  (i)  major \nlandslides causing the loss of an entire section of the mountain slope and the road traversing it; \n(ii) minor landslides depositing a large amount of debris on the road where the mountainside is \nunstable; (iii) flow of debris including large boulders on the road; (iv) severe cracking in the road \ndue to embankment failure and the upheaval of earth; and (v) unstable mountainside slopes that \nmay  potentially  become  landslides.  Lack  of  maintenance  and  extreme  weather  conditions  will \naccelerate the deterioration of the damaged roads. Overall damage is estimated at PRs20.165 \nbillion ($339.5 million). \n\n4. \nBridges  were  also  affected  by  the  earthquake,  but  the  damage  to  them  was  not \nextensive.  Of  particular  mention  is  Balakot  bridge,  on  which  severe  damage  was  observed  in \nthe  reinforced  concrete  superstructure  and  the  abutments.  Some  other,  smaller  concrete \nbridges, culverts, and suspension bridges on rural roads were also damaged.   \n\nIn  the  four  affected  districts  of  AJK  (Bagh,  Muzaffarabad,  Neelum,  and  Poonch),  it  is \n5. \nestimated that about 2,366 km roads were damaged. Of these, 203 km are major roads, 761 km \nare  other  paved  roads,  and  182  km  are  unpaved  roads,  for  a  total  of  1,146  km,  representing \n45%  of  the  total  PWD-managed  roads.  The  Neelam  Valley  road  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the \nJehlum  Valley  road  were  severely  damaged.  Both  roads  are  the  primary  transport  arteries  in \nAJK.  Another  1,220  km  of  local  unpaved  roads  developed  with  community  participation  and \nmanaged by LGRD are damaged. This represents 44% of the total LGRDD roads in the affected \ndistricts. The assessed damage in AJK is estimated at PRs9,190 million. \n\n6. \nIn  NWFP,  about  2,063  km  of  roads  were  damaged  representing  31%  of  the  total  road \nnetwork in the five affected districts (Abbottabad, Battagram, Kohistan, Mansehra, and Shangla). \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nOf  these,  652  km  are  provincial  highways  managed  by  FHA,  1,016  km  are  other  paved \nprovincial roads managed by the districts, 367 km are unpaved districts roads, and 27 km are \nurban roads that are managed by municipal agencies. Estimate assessed damage in NWFP are \nPRs7,363 million ($124 million). \n\n7. \nThe  three  national  highways  damaged  by  the  earthquake  include  Mansehra-Pattan \n(N35), Mansehra-Naran (N15), and Kohala-Muzaffarabad (N75). The damaged length is about \n194  km  representing  72%  of  the  total  length.  Estimated  assessed  damage  to  the  national \nhighways1 is PRs3,481 million. \n\nC. \n\nGovernment Response to the Earthquake \n\nAs soon as initial information on the extent and scale of damages to the main national \n8. \nhighways  was  received,  the  Government  mobilized  all  available  resources  at  its  disposal  to \nclear  the  transport  corridors  to  the  affected  areas.  This  effort  was  led  by  the  Army  Corps  of \nEngineers and by the army-owned Frontier Works Organization. The latter is one of the major \nconstruction firms in the road sector and possesses a large equipment fleet and skilled human \nresources  which  are  needed  for  massive  emergency  works.  At  present,  the  Frontier  Works \nOrganization  is  continuing  with  the  work  of  clearing  the  national  highways.  The  army\u2019s \nengineering units are also involved in clearing the other provincial roads. \n\n9. \nFHA,  NWFP\u2019s  Works  and  Services  Department  and  AJK\u2019s  PWD  have  mobilized  all \navailable resources, including contractors and consultants already assigned to different works, \nto quickly clear and rehabilitate major roads. The variation orders to contractors and consultants \nfor immediate rehabilitation in the affected areas are eligible for retroactive financing under the \nProject.\n\nD. \n\nScope \n\n10. \nThis  component  will  rehabilitate  earthquake-damaged  major  roads  and  bridges,  except \nnational  highways  (footnote  1),  within  the  four  affected  districts  in  AJK  (Bagh,  Muzaffarabad,  \nNeelum, and Poonch) and the five affected districts in NWFP (Abbottabad, Battagram, Kohistan, \nMansehra, and Shangla). The component will cover the repair and rehabilitation of the damaged \nmajor  roads  and  bridges  under  PWD  and  LGRDD  in  AJK  and  under  FHA  and  district \ngovernments  in  NWFP.  Road  clearance  now  in  place  is  not  anticipated  to  last  permanently, \nespecially  beyond  the  coming  snow  season.  More  thorough  and  permanent  road  rebuilding  is \nrequired,  particularly  including  protection  works  to  minimize  landslides  and  river  erosion  and \nimproved drainage for slope stabilization. Rehabilitation works will restore roads and bridges to \nthe prequake level or higher standard, as this is considered cost-effective in the long run. Where \ntechnically  feasible  and  justified,  works  will  include  protection  measures  to  mitigate  damage \nfrom  future  landslides.  Resettlement  will  be  minimal  and  will  be  confined  to  areas  where  the \noriginal road cannot be reconstructed and requires partial realignment. \n\n11. \nTo enhance the government\u2019s quick response to future disasters including aftershocks of \nthis earthquake, road sector agencies will need to be equipped with appropriate equipment and \nmachinery to deploy in landslide-prone areas (through the quick-disbursing component). \n\n                                                \n1 The  World  Bank  is  financing  reconstruction  of  the  national  highways  through  additional  financing  to  its  ongoing \n\nHighway Rehabilitation Project.  \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n49\n\nE. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n12. \nThe cost of the component is estimated at $140.0 million equivalent including a foreign \nexchange cost of $84.6 million. The local currency cost is $55.4 million equivalent and includes \nlocal  taxes  and  duties  of  approximately  $5.2  million.  The  summary  cost  estimate  is  in  Table \nA4.1.  The  interest  during  construction  is  estimated  at  $1.4  million,  which  will  be  paid  by  the \nGovernment.  \n\nTable A4.1: Cost Estimate \n($ million equivalent) \n\nForeign\nExchange \n\nItem\nCivil Works \nEquipment \n \n\n83.1 \n1.5 \n84.6 \n  Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nLocal\nCurrency \n55.4 \n0.0 \n55.4 \n\nTotal \n\n138.5 \n1.5 \n140.0 \n\n13. \nThe  allocation  of  the  civil  works  among  types  of  roads  or  implementing  agencies  is \nbased on the recovery needs identified by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)/World Bank joint \nneeds assessment as summarized in Table A4.2.

Consulting services will be \nengaged by the concerned implementing agency as approved by steering committee. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n51\n\nPOWER SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nDamages and Impact of the Earthquake\n\nThe  8  October  2005  earthquake  in  northern  Pakistan  damaged  and  disrupted  power \n1. \ngeneration  and  supply  systems  in  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK)  and  the  eastern  part  of \nNorth-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP).  Five  companies  are  involved  in  generating  power  and \nsupplying it to and within the earthquake-affected areas of AJK and NWFP.  In terms of power \ngeneration  AJK  Electricity  Department  (AJKED),  Sarhad  Hydro  Development  Organization \n(SHYDO), and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) Hydel have a total of 10 \nhydro  generation  stations  within  the  affected  areas.  In  terms  of  power  distribution,  AJKED, \nIslamabad  Electric  Supply  Company  (IESCO),  and  Peshawar  Electric  Supply  Company \n(PESCO) supply electricity to the affected areas. \n\n2. \nThe  power  supply  system  was  restored  within  days  of  the  earthquake,  but  nearly  all \nrepairs were temporary and need to be replaced by permanent solutions. Some areas still have \nnot yet been fully inspected because access to them is not yet possible due to the collapse of \nroads  and  continuing  landslides.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  earthquake,  it  was  necessary  to \nestablish  tent  villages  and  relief  camps  for  dislocated  people.  These  tent  villages  and  relief \ncamps need to be electrified to ensure security and lighting at night, power to pump water, and \nthe efficient operation of schools and other facilities. The installation of temporary electrification \nin tent villages and relief camps needs to be funded, and the recurring costs of their electricity \nconsumption should be paid to the supplying distribution companies.  \n\nThe  preliminary  damage  and  needs  assessment  (PDNA)  prepared  for  the  Government \n3. \nby  a  joint  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank  team  estimated  power  sector \nreconstruction  costs  to  be  PRs1.9  billion  ($31.7  million).  Further  detailed  reconstruction \nestimates indicate that this amount will be higher when the costs of electrification and electricity \nconsumption in the growing number of tent villages and relief camps are included. In addition, \nabout 30% of electricity distribution networks in AJK and 20% in NWFP have yet to be surveyed \nfor damage and taken into consideration in the PDNA report. The contingency allocated to the \npower  sector  component  is  earmarked  to  address  the  eventual  damage  assessment  in  the \nareas not yet inspected. \n\nB. \n\nProject Scope\n\nThe  Project  component  comprises  rehabilitation  of  the  power  generation  and  supply \n4. \nsystem  infrastructure  that  was  damaged  during  the  earthquake,  and  the  electrification  of  tent \nand relief camps as well as related electricity supply to these camps for up to 2 years.  In detail, \nthe Project will cover (i) repair of nine hydropower generation stations inclusive of access roads, \nbuildings, and ancillary facilities; (ii) supply and installation of equipment and lines related to the \n132kV, 33kV, and 11kV substations; (iii) construction of operational buildings of substations and \nrelated  staff  quarters;  (iv)  0.4kV  and  0.22kV  low  voltage  lines  (v)  service  connections  to \nconsumers;  vi)  spare  parts,  operational  vehicles,  and  tools  (vii)  installation  of  transformers, \nmeters,  and  service  connections  to  the  tent  villages  and  relief  camps  established  after  8 \nOctober  2005;  (viii)  payment  for  electricity  supply  for  up  to  two  years  to  the  tent  villages  and \nrelief  camps,  and  (ix)  installation  of  transformers,  meters,  and  service  connections  to  the \nanticipated  new  model  villages  to  be  established  for  the  victims  of  the  earthquake.  \nReconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  the  facilities  to  pre-\nearthquake levels or to a higher standard as considered cost-effective in the medium to long - \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nterm. The installation of electricity to the tent villages and relief camps will be done with safety of \nthe occupants and the network as a high priority.  \n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n5. \nThe  cost  of  the  power  sector  component  is  estimated  at  $53.5  million  equivalent, \nincluding  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $24.0  million.  The  local  currency  cost  is  $29.5  million \nequivalent  and  includes  local  taxes  and  duties  of  approximately  $2.5  million.  Interest  during \nconstruction  will  be  paid  by  the  Government  and  amounts  to  $0.4  million  for  the  power  sector \ncomponent. The summary cost estimate is in Table A5.1.  \n\nItem\n\nTable A5.1: Cost Estimate \n($ million) \nForeign\nExchange \n\nLocal\nCurrency \n\nCivil Works \nEquipment \n \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates \n\nTotal \n\n3.5 \n20.5 \n24.0 \n\n2.3 \n27.2 \n29.5 \n\nTotal\n\n5.8 \n47.7 \n53.5 \n\n6. \nThe  detailed  cost  estimate  per  executing  agency  is  shown  in  Table  A5.2,  which  also \nidentifies the individual items for financing.

Each  implementing  agency  has  been  provided  an \nallocated directly related to the damages and reconstruction needs within their respective areas, \nand  accordingly  each  implementing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  development  of  respective \nsubprojects.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  their \nrespective subprojects.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nAll  reconstruction  works  are  scheduled  to  be  completed  within  3  years.  The  detailed \n\n10. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n\nThe  procurement  procedures  for  the  power  sector  component  are  identical  to  those  of \n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\n11. \nthe overall Project. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n12. \nThe implementing agencies in the power sector have, for the most part, the capabilities \nand technical expertise to implement the power sector component of the Project.  However, to \nassist  with development  of  procurement  packages  inclusive  of  establishment  of  specifications, \nto  ensure  transparency,  and  independent  monitoring,  consulting  services  will  be  required  to \nassist  the  implementing  agencies  with  (i)  preparation  of  the  subproject  proposals  to  ensure \ncompliance with subproject criteria, (ii) preparation of detail design, cost estimates, and bidding \ndocuments, (iii) conduct general construction and installation supervision, (iv) random checking \nfor  quality  assurance  purposes,  (v)  undertake  and  prepare  required  environment  and  social \nassessment studies including resettlement plan to ensure compliance with the Government and \nADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i) \nelectrical  engineering  specifically  in  power  supply  systems,  and  (ii)  structural  engineering  for \nbuildings.   \n\nThe consultants will be hired by the concerned implementing agency with the approval of \n13. \nERRA  or  SC  as  the  case  may  be.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n55\n\nSOCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nBefore  the  earthquake,  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK)  had  adequate  primary  and \n1. \nsecondary healthcare facilities as well as referral hospitals for its population of 3.4 million. There \nwere seven district hospitals, six subdistrict hospitals, 31 rural health centers, 184 basic health \nunits, and 105 dispensaries. The district hospitals provided coverage to both the urban and rural \npopulations of the districts.  \n\n2. \nThe  damage  assessment  survey  jointly  undertaken  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) and World Bank found that the extent of damage to the health sector in AJK far exceeds \ninitial expectations. The assessment reported that health facilities were completely destroyed or \nmade irreparable in Bagh and Poonch districts. The damage in Muzaffarabad is reported at 70\u2013\n80%  of  the  entire  health  infrastructure  of  the  district.  Besides  the  infrastructure,  most  of  the \nmedical and office equipment, furniture, drugs, and laboratories were destroyed. Information on \nambulances  and  supervisory  vehicles  is  not  available  but  21  four-wheel  vehicles  and  six \nmotorcycles  have  been  reported  destroyed.  These  losses  have  resulted  in  a  complete \nbreakdown  of  the  health  system,  severely  disrupting  the  provision  of  both  secondary  and \nprimary healthcare services. In addition, health management at the central, district, and facility \nlevel was paralyzed, and most official and health management information records and systems \nwere lost.\n\nTable A6.1: Summary of Damage to the Healthcare System in Affected Areas \n\nType of Health \nInstitution/Offices\n\nTertiary care hospital \nSecondary care (district, \nsubdistrict, and civil hospitals) \nFirst-level healthcare facilities \n(RHCs, BHUs and MCH centers)\nOther health facilities \n(dispensaries, first-aid posts, etc) \nHealth management offices \nTotal health facilities \nLost vehicles/motorcycles  \n\nTotal \n\nNumber\nFully \nDamaged\n\nNumber\nPartly \nDamaged\n\nEstimated\nReplacement Cost in \nPRs (millions) \n\n0 \n16 \n\n203 \n\n218 \n\n17 \n454 \n21/6 \n \n\n1 \n13 \n\n68 \n\n32 \n\n3 \n117 \n0 \n \n\n500 \n\n6,798\n\n8,091\n\n159\n318 \n15,866 \n22 \n15,888 \n\n3. \nPrior  to  the  earthquake,  the  literacy  rate  in  AJK  was  estimated  to  be  64%  of  the  total \npopulation,  or  about  56%  among  females  and  80%  among  males.  Education  has  remained  a \npriority  with  the  AJK  government,  as  about  27%  of  its  total  recurring  budget  is  allocated  to \neducation.  The  damage  assessment  survey  has  identified  Bagh,  Muzaffarabad,  Neelum,  and \nPoonch  (Rawlakot)  as  the  worst  affected  districts  in  AJK  with  regards  to  education.  The  total \nnumber of government schools and colleges in AJK prior to the earthquake was 7,258. Of these, \n3,879,  or  53%,  were  in  the  three  worst  affected  districts.  There  were  290,000  students  (44% \ngirls) and 12,971 teachers in these three districts.  \n\n4. \nEducational  institutions  of  all  levels,  from  primary  schools  to  degree  colleges  and  the \nuniversity,  have  suffered  substantial  damage.  Apart  from  damage  to  the  institutions  and \nbuildings, the sector has lost people. According to a United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nreport, almost half of the casualties of the earthquake were children of school age. The number \nof lost school staff and teachers is 853 for both AJK and NWFP. \n\nTable A6.2:  Summary of Damage to Educational Institutions \n\nInstitutions\n\nGovernment primary \n\nGovernment middle \n\nGovernment high \n\nGovernment higher second \n\nGovernment intercollege \n\nGovernment colleges and \npostgraduate \n\nTechnical/vocational \n\nPrivate\n\nAJK University \n\nMaterials and furniture \n\nAdministration buildings \n \n\nTotal \n\nAJK\n\nEstimated\nCost\n(PRs million) \n\nNumber of \nDamaged\nInstitutions\n 2,153  \n\n% of Total \nCost\n\n 565  \n\n 312  \n\n 27  \n\n 25  \n\n 28  \n\n \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n3,064 \n\n 1,341 \n\n 1,473 \n\n 188 \n\n 78 \n\n 1,260  \n\n \n\n0 \n\n 574 \n\n 2,620 \n\n3,463 \n          2,036a \n\n22 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n9 \n\n19 \n\n12 \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nAJK = Azad Jammu and Kashmir. \na  Cost of materials, equipment, and furniture includes PRs540 million for AJK University. \n\n3,685 \n\n 13,660 \n\n100 \n\n5. \nADB is processing an emergency assistance package for the earthquake-affected areas. \nApart  from  other  sectors,  the  government  of  AJK  has  shown  interest  in  securing  funds  to \nsupport  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  essential  social  sector  infrastructure.  The \nsocial  sector  component  will  focus  on  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating  selected  health  and \neducation facilities located within the affected districts.  \n\nB.  \n\nObjective \n\n6. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  address  the  greatest  social-sector  needs  of \nearthquake-affected people. District and subdistrict headquarters being the major urban centers \nof AJK, people from remote areas use the health and educational facilities in these places. The \ntask of reconstructing and rehabilitating social-sector facilities is gigantic and will take place over \na  period  of  time.  Most  of  the  locations  where  primary  health  and  education  services  are \ndamaged  are  remote  and  difficult  to  get  to  because  of  damaged  roads.  The  capacity  and \noutreach required to build these services both in the public and private sector has to be put in \nplace before work can begin on rebuilding these facilities. However, work can begin immediately \nin such urban areas as district and subdistrict headquarters and in accessible rural areas, and \nwhere capacities are currently concentrated. The urban centers and larger rural settlements are \nthe  worst  affected,  as  these  were  densely  populated.  Immediate  restoration  of  heath  facilities \nand education in these centers will benefit the most people, apart from accommodating people \nfrom surrounding areas in the short term. This approach is advocated in the short-term recovery \nstrategy recommended in the damage and need assessment and agreed with the Government. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n57\n\nto  people \n\nfield  hospitals  provide  emergency  healthcare  assistance \n\nIn  the  health  sector,  the  present  arrangement  in  the  emergency  relief  phase  is  that \n7. \nvarious \nin  Bagh, \nMuzaffarabad,  and  Rawlakot.  The  seriously  injured  are  being  referred  to  Rawalpindi  and \nAbbotabad for treatment. Prior to the earthquake, there was one referral health facility at each \ndistrict  headquarters.  In  addition,  there  was  a  hospital  in  each  subdistrict  headquarters.  In \nMuzaffarabad, the capital of AJK, the 400-bed Combined Military Hospital was administratively \nunder  the  armed  forces  but  with  the  government  of  AJK  providing  80%  of  its  administrative \ncosts. The other hospital in Muzaffarabad was the 300-bed Abbas Institute of Medical Sciences, \nwhich  provided  referral  services  to  the  civilian  population  of  AJK.  As  these  facilities  have \nsuffered irreparable damage for the most part, practically no referral facilities exist today. In the \nshort term, many relief  agencies are providing these services through makeshift hospitals that \nhave concentrated the population seeking medical aid in Muzaffarabad and other major urban \ncenters in AJK. This temporary relief infrastructure is expected to start thinning out very soon, \nand there will be immense pressure to provide referral services in districts and subdistricts. The \nhealth component will focus on reconstructing one hospital in district headquarters with 150\u2013250 \nbeds  each  and  three  hospitals  in  subdistrict  headquarters  with  60\u201380  beds  each.  All  of  these \nhospitals will be equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities to provide referral facilities for \npeople  from  all  parts  of  AJK,  but  particularly  from  earthquake-affected  districts.  Health \nadministration buildings have also been seriously damaged, which seriously hampers the ability \nof the Health Department to respond to the emergency.  The component will also provide for the \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of health management buildings. \n\n8. \nIn  ongoing  relief  and  rescue  operations,  many  agencies  focus  on  providing  temporary \nstructures for primary education institutions, but middle and high schools are too big for these \nagencies to handle. In addition, as in the health sector, primary education facilities are scattered, \nsituated at remote locations and currently difficult to reach. As the immediate need identified in \nthe  reconstruction  strategy  for  education  is  to  restart  classes,  the  reconstructed  and \nrehabilitated middle and high schools can also be used to accommodate students of the nearby \nprimary  schools  over  the  short  term.  The  resumption  of  routine  school  activities  would  help \nestablish  some  kind  of  normalcy  in  the  lives  of  the  school  children,  teachers,  and  staff.  The \ncomponent will focus on reconstructing and rehabilitating 550 government middle schools and \n300  high  schools,  including  the  provision  of  all  essential  furniture  and  equipment.  The \ncomponent will also assess, and advise on, the physical and psychological health of students, \nas well as train trainers for teacher training. \n\nC.  \n\nScope \n\n9. \nThe health subcomponent will include (i) construction of one (150 to 250 bedded) district \nhospital  and  three  (40\u201380  bedded)  Tehsil  headquarter  hospitals,  including  wards,  operation \ntheatres, outpatient departments and other necessary services; (ii) provision of all the essential \nmedical  equipment  to  the  hospitals  including  ambulances  and  supplies;  (iii)  construction  of \nproper waiting areas and provision of public toilets and clean drinking water for visitors; and iv) \nconsultancy  and  administrative  assistance  including  health  management  planning.  German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation is actively negotiating a soft component for the health sector, \nto  be \nwhich  will \noperationalized in parallel with the ADB emergency assistance loan. \n\ntraining  management  support  and  systems,  and  planning \n\ninclude \n\n10. \nThe education subcomponent would include: (i) repair and reconstruction, according to \nimproved  seismic  designs  of  about  550  partly  and  completely  damaged  government  middle \nschools  building,  latrines,  office  accommodation  (ii)  provision  of  all  essential  furniture  and \nequipment for all the middle schools reconstructed and repaired; (iii) training of master trainers \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nfor  teachers  training;  (iv)  school  health  services  for  physical  and  physiological  health \nassessment and advise; and (v) consultancy and administrative assistance. \n\n11. \nThe  cost  of the  health  subcomponent  is  estimated  at  $29.7  million  including  taxes  and \nduties  of  approximately  $1.6  million.  The  cost  of  the  education  subcomponent  is  estimated  at \n$23.6  million  including  taxes  and  duties  of  approximately  $1.0  million.

It  also  takes  into \nconsideration the priorities determined by the government of AJK for additional activities to be \nundertaken  as  part  of  the  Multisector  Rehabilitation  and  Improvement  Project  in  AJK.  The \nselection is based on the following criteria: \n\n(i)  Social sector facilities located in the earthquake affected zone in AJK; \n(ii)  Addressing the basic emergency needs in the affected areas; \n(iii)  No overlap of assistance from other donors for the assistance;  \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n59\n\n(iv)  Determined as priority for ADB assistance by Government of AJK; and \n(v)  Subprojects are technical feasible, cost efficient and financially sustainable. \n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n14. \nThe  social  component  of  the  emergency  assistance  will  be  implemented  through  the \nimplementation  arrangement  established  under  the  ongoing  Loan  2153  PAK  (SF)  Multisector \nRehabilitation  and  Improvement  Project  for  AJK,  by  further  strengthening  the  existing  project \nmanagement  units  and  project  implement  units  (PIUs)  with  staff  and  technical  assistance \nconsultants,  if  the  SC  decides  to  use  this  existing  mechanism  as  implementing  agency  for \nsubprojects.  The  Multisector  Rehabilitation  and  Improvement  Project  for  AJK  is  at  the  take-off \nphase with implementation arrangements in place and activities in the various sectors about to \nbe  initiated.  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  will  undertake  civil  works  through  the  Works \nDepartment  or  RA.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  to  assist  the  DOH  or  RA  as  the  case \nmay be: (i) in the preparation of the layout for the hospitals including detailed engineering with \nseismic  provisions,  bid  preparation,  assistance \nin  procurement  and  construction, \nsupervision/contract administration of civil works, and procurement of equipment; (ii) determine \nthe needs of the equipments in consultation with the administration of the hospital and specialist \nconsultants;  (iii)  project  management  and  reporting;  and  (iv)  assess  and  undertake  any \nnecessary  study  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguards  policies.  The  health  subcomponent  will  require  20  person-months  of \ninternational consultancy services, mainly providing health management specialist services and \ntechnical  advice,  and  200  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  for  surveys,  design, \nsupervision, and project management. In addition, the implementing agency (which can be RA \nor DOH) of health will require strengthening in terms of both human resources and capacity, for \nwhich administrative support will be provided. \n\n15. \nFor education, the AJK Department of Education (DOE) will be the implementing agency. \nA  previously  existing  headed  by  a  project  implementation  officer  with  essential  staff  has  been \nestablished within the DOE to oversee implementation. The PIU will be responsible for overall \nmanagement  of  the  education  component,  including  (i)  procurement  of  civil  works  and \nequipments, (ii) coordination with other departments and line agencies, (iii) progress monitoring, \nand  (iv)  audit  of  accounts  and  preparation  of  progress  reports.  The  PIU  will  undertake \nprocurement through an interdepartmental purchase committee established within the DOE but \nhaving  representation  of  the  Finance  Department  and  P&D  Department.  DOE  will  undertake \ncivil works through their own Public Works Department. Consulting services will be required to \nassist  the  DOE  with  (i)  the  preparation  of  the  layout  for  high  and  middle  schools  including \ndetailed  engineering  with  seismic  provisions,  bid  preparation,  assistance  in  procurement  and \nconstruction, supervision/contract administration of civil works, and procurement of equipment; \nand (ii) project management and reporting. The education subcomponent will require 20 person-\nmonths of international consultancy services, mainly providing education management specialist \nservices  and  technical  advice,  and  200  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  for \nsurveys,  design,  supervision,  and  project  management.  In  addition,  the  PIU  will  require \nstrengthening in terms of both human resources and capacity, for which administrative support \nwill be provided.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nLEGAL ASSISTANCE, GOVERNANCE, AND INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING \n\n1. \nThe destruction caused by the earthquake has created legal and documentary issues for \nearthquake  affected  people  and  generated  a  tremendous  strain  on  government  administration \nand  resources,  at  national,  provincial  and  local  levels.  This  subcomponent  seeks  to  assist  the \nfederal,  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  and  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK) \ngovernments to build institutional strength and capacity to effectively deal with issues and risks \nassociated with restoring lost documents and helping earthquake victims retain their legal rights \nand entitlements in a timely and effective manner. This subcomponent also seeks to build local \ngovernment capacity to provide special services to earthquake-affected people, especially those \nwho  are  more  vulnerable.  The  subcomponent  aims  to  compliment  and  support  existing \nadministration  structures,  wherever  possible.  This  subcomponent  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  following  principles:  (i)  affected  people  are  offered  people-centered \nsolutions and recognition is given, at an early stage that vulnerable groups require special and \nurgent arrangements; (ii) rehabilitation activity is designed for, and implemented by, the lowest \nlevel of  mandated and competent agency; (iii) durable arrangements are made, which assign \nclear  responsibilities  for  central  and  localized  strategic  coordination;  (iv)  needs  and  sectoral \ntechnical responses are assessed and defined in ways that avoid unmanageable demands; (v) \ninnovative  institutional  arrangements  are  created  (even  if  only  temporary)  through  which \nspecialized expertise can be quickly mobilized and held accountable; and (vi) validation, audit, \naccountability,  judicial  and  quasi-judicial  arrangements  are  stipulated  with  a  clearer  view  of \nenhancing the predictability of outcomes for disaster-affected people. Details of implementation \narrangements  under  this  subcomponent,  including  the  appointment  of  the  implementing \nagencies,  will  be  developed, \ninto  consideration  changing  circumstances.  The \nimplementing  agencies  with  assistance  from  ADB  resource  person  will  be  responsible  for  the \nimplementation  of  this  subcomponent.  Details  on  each  activity  under  this  subcomponent  are \ndescribed below. \n\ntaking \n\nThe  constituent  parts  of  the  legal  assistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building, \n2. \nwhich may be streamlined or augmented following discussions with the Government and other \ndevelopment partners, are described below: \n\nA. \n\nProvision of National Identity Cards \n\n \n\n3. \nThe  National  Database  and  Registration  Authority  (NADRA)  is  the  agency  that  issues \nnational  identity  cards  (NICs).  Following  the  earthquake,  thousands  of  NICs  will  need  to  be \nreplaced,  and  those  people  previously  without  NICs  will  need  to  be  issued  NICs  in  order  to \nsecure compensation entitlement and other rights. NICs are also used in legal proceedings and \nestablishing  property  and  inheritance  rights.  Issuing  of  new  or  replacement  NICs  will \nsignificantly  reduce  the  incidence  of  fraud.  Consideration  also  needs  to  be  given  to  providing \nNICs  to  children  in  order  to  facilitate  the  identification  and  repatriation  of  abandoned  or \ndisplaced  children  with  their  families  or  relatives,  requiring  a  review  of  the  legal  framework  to \nmake provision for children\u2019s NIC. \n\nCurrently, NADRA is attempting to issue NICs under its existing modalities, however this \n4. \nwill not be sufficient to meet the urgent needs of the earthquake-affected people. Issuing NICs \nto earthquake-affected people cannot be delayed. It will be necessary to develop new modalities \nin order to meet the demand arising from the earthquake. This may include relaxation of certain \nprocedures  used  to  verify  identity,  (e.g.  Union  Council  members  or  other  appropriate  local \nleaders will be involved in attesting the accuracy of information provided by villagers, so that an \nalternative form of attestation will be developed), the requirement for the payment of fees and \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n61\n\nthe establishment of localized offices and additional mobile units with the necessary equipment. \nOther  Government  departments  such  as  the  Central  Board  of  Revenue  and  local  revenue \ndepartments  could  be  used  to  assist  in  the  identification  process  in  order  to  speed  up  the \nprocess.\n\n5. \nThis subproject will support NADRA in its efforts to improve its capacity to issue NICs to \nearthquake  affected  people  as  expeditiously  as  possible  and  to  develop  its  outreach  to \nvulnerable people such as women and children. Support may also be considered for additional \nstaff,  necessary  additional  computer  equipment,  networking  and  connectivity  components, \nphotographic equipment, as well as the purchase of mobile units and office items. The staff of \nthe  mobile  units  will  include  at  least  one  woman  to  ensure  that  female  villagers  have \nopportunities to obtain NICs. \n\nB. \n\nProvision of Documents \n\n6. \nThe  Local  Government,  Elections,  and  Rural  Development  Department  of  NWFP  and \nthe Local Government and Rural Development Department of the AJK would normally oversee \nthe  registration  of  births,  deaths,  and  marriages.  With  respect  to  title  or  ownership  documents \nfor land, these would be issued by revenue officers, variously known as district officer (revenue) \nand deputy district officer (revenue) in NWFP and collector or assistant collector in AJK. These \ndepartments  would  be  responsible  for  providing  duplicates  of  documents  destroyed  in  the \nearthquake.  \n\n7. \nThe  Project  will  provide  support  to  these  departments  by  assisting  them  in  developing \nnew  modalities  in  order  to  expedite  the  process  of  providing  duplicates  of  documents. \nComputerization will be considered where feasible as well as provision of mobile units. Special \nprocedures  will  be  required  to  be  provided  for  quake  affected  areas  with  regard  to  death \ncertification. Provision will be required to be made for acceptance of this certification by courts \nof law for grant of succession certificates, declaratory suits, and revenue officers for mutation of \nrights in the name of legal heirs. There will also be the need to consider alternative processes \nfor the presumption of death. Currently, the presumption of death in relation to a missing person \nis seven years.  Support will be provided to allow local government officers/revenue officers  to \nvisit  areas  affected  by  the  earthquake  in  order  to  issue  duplicates  of  birth  and  marriage \ncertificates  and  issue  death  certificates  and  outreach  to  the  most  seriously  affected  and \nvulnerable people. In addition to these efforts, there will also be a need to launch an effective \npublic awareness campaign so that earthquake affected people are made aware of their rights \nto be issued with duplicates of documents and the new modalities regarding their issue.  \n\n8. \nDisability  certificates  need  to  be  issued  by  the  Medical  Superintendent,  District \nHeadquarters Hospital, to ensure that disabled persons have access to disability entitlements. \nCo-ordination needs to be strengthened between the executive district officer (health) in NWFP \nand  the  district  health  officers  in  AJK,  who  are  responsible  for  local  basic  health  units  and \nregional  health  units,  and  the  medical  superintendent  to  reach  out  to  local  communities. \nCapacity-building may be necessary to deal with disability, health and entitlement issues.  \n\n9. \nThe  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  (AGP)  needs  to  ensure  that  pensioners,  including \nwidows,  are  facilitated  to  obtain  their  pension  entitlements.  Where  public  servants  have  been \ndisabled,  the  AGP  may  consider  pensioning  the  disabled  on  the  basis  of  early  retirement. \nCoordination  is  necessary  between  AGP  and  medical  superintendent  and  local  government \nofficial to facilitate affected people to obtain pension entitlements. \n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nC. \n\nLegal Facilitation and Assistance   \n\n10. \nThe  destruction  brought  about  by  the  earthquake  has,  as  discussed  above,  generated \nlegal and documentary issues for earthquake-affected people and the Government. Such legal \nissues  arise  from  the  loss  of  documents,  such  as  property  titles;  birth,  death,  marriage,  and \ndisability certificates; court records; and bank account and pension documents. They also arise \nfrom  the  devastating  loss  of  life  caused  by  the  earthquake,  as  following  these  mass  deaths, \nproof of death, disability, custody, fostering, and adoption of children, and the inheritance of real \nand  personal  property  have  all  arisen  as  problems.  Issues  such  as  insurance  coverage, \nenhancing  the  limitation  period  for  claiming  compensation,  property  disputes,  and  other \nentitlement issues are follow-on concerns.\n\n11. \nThis  activity  will  support  the  Government  in  developing  a  legislative  framework  for  the \npost earthquake reconstruction period to enable special legal provisions for people and property \naffected by the earthquake, and related purposes. Legislation under the framework will include (i) \nshortening the period for the presumption of death, (ii) providing for the custody, fostering, and \nadoption  of  children,  (iii)  establishing  special  institutional  and  legal  arrangements  for  the \nprotection  of  orphaned  or  displaced  children,  women  and  the  disabled  persons,  and  their \nproperty,  and  (iv)  increasing  the  vigilance  against  abduction  and  human  trafficking.  Provisions \nrelating to the protection of property rights through inheritance would also need to be introduced. \nConsideration  should  also  be  given  to  enhance  the  penalty  for  any  crime,  if  it  is  committed  in \nrelation to property or money intended for earthquake affectees or relief.  \n\nTo  translate  formal  legal  solutions  into  solutions  for  earthquake-affected  people  will \n12. \nrequire  them,  and  divisional  and  district  level  government  officials  and  affected  citizens,  to \nunderstand  the  new  legal  requirements,  and  be  able  to  proceed  along  appropriate  channels. \nThey will also need to have assistance to resolve any legal questions that may arise. Members \nof the law and administration of justice system in earthquake-affected areas will similarly need \nto be made aware of the mechanisms for resolving earthquake related legal and administrative \nproblems.  In  the  earthquake  affected  areas  already  poor  and  vulnerable  people  will  have \ndifficulty negotiating formal avenues, and will clearly need assistance to avail themselves of any \nnew laws and procedures. \n\n13. \nAs  an  activity  of  this  subcomponent,  legal  facilitation  and  assistance  for  earthquake- \nrelated  legal  and  documentary  issues  would  be  provided  to  earthquake  affected  people.  The \nprovision of assistance would be functionally decentralized in the affected areas of NWFP and \nAJK. Staff would have access to transportation in order to conduct outreach, by visiting affected \ncommunities,  and  to  service  all  relevant  areas.  ADB  will  coordinate  with  the  Government  and \nofficials of the earthquake affected districts to determine the number of legal facilitators required \nfor a particular area. However, certain districts may need more assistance than others.  \n\n14. \nA subcomponent coordinator or director, with assistance from at least one staff member, \nwill  coordinate  this  activity,  facilitate  cross  learning  amongst  the  decentralized  offices  and \nmonitor  the  conduct  of  legal  services.  This  activity  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  civil \nsociety  organizations  (CSOs),  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  other  relevant \ndevelopment partners. \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n63\n\nD. \n\nJudicial, Police and Public Officials Training Workshops and Legal Awareness \n\n15. \nJudges,  court  officials,  police  and  revenue  officers  in  the  earthquake-affected  areas \nneed to be familiarized with the property and custody legal issues likely to arise post-earthquake, \nand the special post earthquake legislative framework when enacted. The types of legal issues \nthat  are  likely  to  arise  can  be  anticipated,  including,  for  example,  property,  inheritance, \ncompensation,  rights  of  orphans,  disabled  and  widows,  however  the  details  of  the  sorts  of \ndisputes  have  not  yet  been  identified.  Based  on  more  detailed  data  identifying  the  nature  of \nearthquake-related legal disputes likely to come before the courts, ADB in conjunction with the \nGovernment  would  coordinate  training  of  judicial  revenue  officials  and  police,  and  public  legal \nawareness workshops in or for the earthquake-affected areas. \n\nThe  earthquake  legislative  framework  referred  to  in  paragraph  10  above,  will  presume \n16. \nknowledge  of  the  law  and  imposes  harsh  jail  penalties  for  violations.  Legal  awareness \nworkshops  will  be  coordinated  for  district  officials,  local  law  enforcers,  and  the  public,  in \nconjunction with, or independently from the judicial workshops for earthquake related issues. \n\nE. \n\nPublic Grievance Review Mechanism \n\n17. \nThe legal and factual issues generated by the earthquake, are likely to lead to increased \ndisputes  and  grievances  both  among  earthquake  affected  people,  and  possibly  against \ngovernment officers and departments. The Government will need to ensure that all earthquake \nrelief and reconstruction efforts promote transparency, participation, accountability, and a zero-\ntolerance  for  any  corruption  associated  with  earthquake  assistance.  Similarly  the  proposed \nearthquake  legislative  framework  would  increase  penalties  for  earthquake  related  crimes  and \nimproprieties.\n\n18. \nThe  pre-earthquake  public  redress  procedures  were  a  patchwork  of  federal  and \nprovincial  systems  with  mixed  resources  and  mixed  results.  Those  systems  that  can  operate \neffectively following the earthquake will be supported. Consideration will be given as to whether \nthe  regulatory  framework,  capacity,  accessibility  and  reach  of  the  existing  institutions  are \nadequate.\n\n19. \nIn furtherance of the Government\u2019s objectives, and to assist earthquake affected people \nwith disputes and grievances, it may be necessary to create a decentralized provincial system \nof public grievance review and alternative dispute resolution will be established or supported in \nthe  earthquake  affected  areas  and  staffed  by  independent  persons.  The  mechanisms  would \nseek  to  resolve  private  disputes,  and  investigate  claims  of  impropriety  against  public  officials \nrelating  to  earthquake  assistance.  Proposals  for  achieving  this  end  are  currently  being \nconsidered. In consultation with the Government, NWFP, AJK and NGOs, a number of tried and \ntested mechanisms will be reviewed, in order to determine the most appropriate way to provide \nforms of dispute resolution, public grievance review, and anti-corruption forum, in the context of \nconditions on the ground in earthquake affected areas. \n\nF. \n\nTransparency and Earthquake Data Collection \n\n20. \nThe  Office  of  the  President,  through  the  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation \nAuthority (ERRA), will begin to coordinate the many separate efforts to collect data in relation to \nearthquake  affected  infrastructure  and  earthquake  affected  people.  This  coordination  will \ninclude NADRA, the Central Board of Revenue, relevant local government departments, CSOs \nand  NGOs.  Centralization  of  data  collection  will  minimize  duplications  of  efforts,  focus  relief \n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nefforts to those earthquake affected people who need it the most and limit the extent to which \nearthquake  affected  people  are  approached  by  multiple  government  agencies  and  NGOs  for \nsimilar data collection questions. In the longer term, such data collection will be invaluable to the \ngovernmental and other relief agencies for future planning and understanding lessons learned. \n\n21. \nThis  activity  will  support  ERRA  in  coordinating  this  activity  by  providing  data  collection \nmanagers who can train staff and advice on connectivity of data and networking issues. Subject \nto an initial technical and needs assessment, consideration may also be given for the provision \nof computer equipment, software licenses and the recruitment of new staff. \n\n22. \nTransparency  and  access  to  information  standards  need  to  be  agreed  so  that \nstakeholders are aware of transparency and access to information obligations. Local institutions \nsuch  LGO  monitoring  committees  and  NGOs,  CSOs  and  local  media  may  be  engaged  to \nenhance  transparency  and  the  flow  of  information.  Provision  of  information  management \nsystems, computerization and networking will need to be supported. \n\nIn  addition,  ERRA  will  facilitate  the  coordination  required  to  ensure  that  information  on \n23. \nearthquake  assistance,  post  earthquake  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  names  of  affectees \nand  extent  of  damage  suffered  by  them,  and  related  laws  and  policies,  will  be  placed  on  an \nearthquake website, and published in English, Pushtoo, and Urdu in local newspapers as well \nas on national and provincial television and radio. To keep the public notified, these publications \nand  broadcasts  will  be  regularly  updated  at  least  every  quarter.  This  would  require  some \ncoordination  amongst  departments,  donors,  and  NGOs  to  obtain  the  appropriate  information. \nThe information to be included should present financial statements, track procurement contract \nawards, including its amount, and basic information on the processes adopted, list of goods or \nservices purchased and their utilization. \n\nG. \n\nVocational Training  \n\n24. \nThe earthquake left many households without any income-generating capacity. Many of \nthese household have lost their breadwinner. Single women and widows now face the need to \nprovide for their families. Many of them will have to enter the job market, often for the first time. \nThe  need  arises  to  provide  them  with  free  vocational  training,  designed  to  give  them  the \npossibility  to  approach  the  market  as  semi-skilled  labor  for  positions  which  are  socially \nacceptable.  Another  group  of  vulnerable  people,  who  may  need  to  enter  the  job  market  and \nneed special training, are the disabled. In fact, disabled are equally capable to produce income \nand can be a valuable source of income for their families. For this reason they need to be given \nequal  opportunity  of  access  to  the  labor  market  and  accordingly,  they  will  also  need  special \nassistance. In both cases, there is also the need to assist the trainees in finding a job, once the \ntraining  has  been  completed.  This  activity  aims  at  building  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nlocal governments in delivering and managing training programs designed to reach vulnerable \npeople  who  have  been  particularly  affected  by  the  earthquake  and  need  targeted  assistance \nand complements the vulnerable people action plan in Appendix 17 and the gender action Plan \nin Appendix 16. \n\n25. \nThe special training needs to be designed by specialized consultants. These consultants \nwill work with the relevant departments of NWPF and AJK to strengthen their capacity to deliver \nsuch  trainings  and  to  facilitate  the  participation  of  the  target  groups  to  the  courses.  The \nconsultants will also design and implement a program of post-training assistance to find jobs. \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n65\n\nH. \n\nADB\u2019s Approach to Implementation \n\n26. \nFrom  its  involvement  in  other  natural  disasters,  ADB  has  learned  that  post  disaster \nrehabilitation  and  recovery  is  most  effective  when  (i)  affected  people  are  offered  people- \ncentered  solutions  and  recognition  is  given,  at  an  early  stage,  that  vulnerable  groups  require \nspecial and urgent arrangements; (ii) rehabilitation activity is designed for, and implemented by, \nthe  lowest  level  of  mandated  and  competent  agency;  (iii)  durable  arrangements  are  made, \nwhich assign clear responsibilities for central and localized strategic coordination; (iv) needs and \nsectoral  technical  responses  are  assessed  and  defined  in  ways  that  avoid  unmanageable \ndemands; (v) innovative institutional arrangements are created (even if only temporary) through \nwhich specialized expertise can be quickly mobilized and held accountable; and (vi) validation, \naudit, accountability, judicial and quasi-judicial arrangements are stipulated with a clear view of \nenhancing the predictability of outcomes for disaster affected people. \n\n27. \nADB  will  work  with  the  federal  Government  and  with  NWFP  province  and  AJK  state \nGovernments to ensure that this subcomponent is implemented in a manner which incorporates \nthe  principles  set  out  in  paragraph  21  above.  As  the  Government  and  other  development \npartners  are  working  in  related  areas,  there  will  be  a  need  to  continue  coordination  to  ensure \nthat Government and development partner activities, as well as those of the ADB, complement \neach others activities.  \n\n28. \nConsistent with the sector approach adopted for the entire Project, ADB\u2019s assistance will \nseek  to  support  good  governance,  anti-corruption,  and  the  legal  and  public  administrative \ninfrastructure  through  cofinance,  and  gap-filling  in  areas  not  yet  covered,  and  in  areas  where \nADB has a comparative advantage. ADB will actively coordinate with development partners and \nthe Government to minimize duplication, encourage cofinancing and have a catalytic effect on \nthe provision of additional resources. To provide against the duplication of efforts, the allocation \nof  ADB  funds  for  this  activity  may  be  adjusted  to  ensure  delivery  of  balanced  and  demand \nresponsive institutional assistance. \n\n29. \nThis  subcomponent  will  be  coordinated  through  ERRA.  Advisory  technical  assistance \nengaged  by  ADB  and  associated  contracts  to  implement  activities  in  an  agreed  annual  work \nplan will be administered by ADB under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 8 \n\nTable A8: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency \n\nTotal\nCost\n\nCategory \nA.

The  eligibility  criteria  listed  represent \nthreshold general selection criteria for a subproject to be satisfied prior to application of sector-\nspecific criteria. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  subproject  will  rehabilitate  or  restore  damaged  infrastructure  and  facilities \ncaused  by  the  earthquake,  based  on  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment, and assessments carried out by the project consultants. \nThe  subproject  is  technically  feasible,  cost-effective  and  financially  sustainable, \nincorporates  multi-hazard-resistant  design  standards  of  the  Government  of \nPakistan or equivalent authorities; and represents a least-cost alternative. \nThe subproject will incorporate beneficiary consultation and input in the selection \nprocess where applicable. \nThe subproject will be completed within the project implementation period. \nThe funding of the subproject will not overlap with funding from other agencies, \nthough  such  agencies  may  cofinance  specified  support,  including  monitoring, \ncapacity building, and identified poverty reduction. \nAll  necessary  approvals  of \nthe  national  and  respective  state/provincial \ngovernments  will  be  obtained  for  the  subprojects  before  submission  by  the \nimplementing agencies to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval. \nSubprojects will be prioritized on the basis of their social and economic impacts. \n\n(vii) \n(viii)  The subproject is: (a) in compliance with applicable national and state laws and \nADB Environment  Policy  (2002);  and  (b)  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements  of  an  agreed  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework. \nSubprojects  that  do  not  satisfy  the  framework  will  not  be  included  under  the \nProject.  For  subprojects  that  require  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE): \n(a)  the  IEE  is  included  in  the  subproject  proposal;  (b)  the  related  environment \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  is  prepared  for  design  and  implementation; \nand  (c)  Government  environment  clearance  including  all  necessary  clearances \nas  applicable  for  respective  states  is  obtained  prior  to  award  of  the  subproject \ncontract.  In  the  exceptional  cases  of  subprojects  that  require  an  environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA), the EIA will be prepared according to the procedures \nspecified  in  the  environmental  assessment  review  framework  (EARF)  and \napproved  by  the  State  Governments  and  ADB  prior  to  approval  of  the \nsubproject.1\nThe  subproject  is  (a)  in  compliance  with  applicable  national  and  state  laws  and \nADB Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995);  (b)  minimizes  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement,  and  limits  resettlement  to  unencumbered  public  lands  to  the \nextent  possible  and  that  has  not  been  squatted  upon;  and  (c)  is  prepared  in \naccordance  with  an  agreed  resettlement  framework.  For  subprojects  involving \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  affected  persons,  a  resettlement  plan  in \naccordance  with  the  agreed  resettlement  framework  will  be  formulated  and \n\n(ix) \n\n                                                \n1  The summary EIA of this particular subproject will be disclosed through ADB website 120 days prior to approval of \n\nit.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nB. \n\nProcedures  \n\n4. \nprocedures (Table A10): \n\nforwarded to ADB for review and approval prior to acquisition of any land or the \naward of subproject contracts. \n\nAll  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  processed  in  accordance  with  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe implementing agencies will select a subproject from the list agreed with ADB \nduring the loan inception mission for the Project, or propose other subprojects that \nqualify  given  the  eligibility  criteria  and  prepare  a  project  concept  paper,  which \ndescribes  the  main  elements  of  the  proposed  subprojects  and  main  justification, \nand  (a)  categorize  resettlement  significance  using  resettlement  categorization \nchecklist  and  (b)  environmental  screening  checklist.  As  this  Project  is  in \nenvironment category B, the relevant procedures apply. \n The  above  checklists  will  be  submitted  to  the  implementing  agencies  in  the \nrespective  states  for  review.  If  the  implementing  agencies  find  that  the  proposed \nsubproject  is  eligible  in  light  of  the  eligibility  criteria  and  the  reports  are  in  order, \nimplementing  agencies  will  send  the  reports  to  ADB  for  further  review,  to  obtain \nnecessary  guidance  with  regard  to  the  extent  of  relevant  analysis,  assessment, \nplan, etc. \n\n(iii)  ADB  will  review  the  subproject  concept  reports  submitted  by  the  implementing \nagencies/SCs.  If  ADB  finds  that  a  proposed  subproject  is  not  likely  to  satisfy  the \neligibility criteria and/or the agreed procedures, ADB will advise the implementing \nagency  either  (a)  to  modify  the  subproject  proposal  in  a  manner  that  will  make  it \neligible  for approval  or  (b)  that  the  subproject must  be  rejected.  If  a  subproject  is \nrejected, the IA may propose a replacement subproject. If the proposed subproject \nsatisfies the eligibility criteria and procedures, based on the resettlement checklist, \nADB  will  advise  on  the  requirements  of  preparation  and  application  of  the \nresettlement plan. \n\n(iv)  Following  approval  of  a  subproject  concept  by  implementing  agencies,  SCs  and \nADB,  the  relevant  implementing  agency  will  conduct  a  feasibility  study  and \npreliminary  design  or  other  similar  design  works,  and  based  on  those  works, \ndevelop  a  resettlement  plan  (if  required)  and  undertake  an  IEE  including  an \nenvironmental management plan. \n\n(v)  The  implementing  agency  will  disclose  the  resettlement  plan  and  IEE  to  the \n\naffected persons and incorporate the results of the consultation. \n\n(vi)  The  report  of  the  feasibility  study  and  preliminary  design/other  design  work, \nincluding  the  resettlement  plan  and  IEE,  will  be  submitted  by  the  implementing \nagency  to  the  SC  for  its  appraisal.  The  implementing  agencies  and  SCs  will \nappraise the reports in light of the relevant frameworks. Based on the review, the \nimplementing  agencies/SCs  will  prepare  a  summary  appraisal  report  for  each  of \nthe subprojects as the case may be. If the implementing agency finds that one or \nmore  proposed  subprojects  are  technically,  environmentally,  and  socially  viable, \nand all reports are in order, the implementing agency will send those reports, with \nattachments  including  the  resettlement  plan  (if  required)  and  IEE,  to  ADB  for \nfurther review and approval. \n\n(vii)  ADB will review the summary appraisal reports, together with required attachments. \nIf  ADB  finds  that  the  proposed  subproject  satisfies  the  eligibility  criteria  and \nprocedures,  ADB  will  approve  the  subproject.  If  ADB  finds  that  the  proposed \nsubproject  does  not  satisfy  the  eligibility  criteria  and  procedures,  or  does  not \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                                                                                                     Appendix 10        71 \n\ncomply with sector-specific criteria, and ADB safeguard policies, ADB may advise \nthe  implementing  agency  on  remedial  actions  to  be  taken  for  the  proposed \nsubproject for it to comply or reject the subproject. \n\nTable A10: Summary Procedures for Selection and Approval of Subprojects \n\nActivities \nInitial list of subprojects \n\n1. \n\nRequired Action \n\nResponsibility \n\nPrepare an initial list of subprojects \nwith a brief description of activities to \nbe implemented in each subproject, \nand, along with rough cost estimates, \nsubmit the proposal to the steering \ncommittees through the technical \nsection.\n\nImplementing agencies \nwith assistance \nfrom consultants as \nrequired \n\n2.

Yes \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty partnership agreement?   Yes \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan:\n\nThe rehabilitation components for the transport, power, and social sectors will reestablish services and infrastructure that \nare  crucial  for  the  social  and  economic  life  of  the  affected  areas.  In  particular,  transport  and  power  infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  will  revive  economic  activity,  resulting  in  income  generation,  employment,  and \nrehabilitation of affected people. Health and educational facilities will provide fundamental social services that are needed \nto rebuild the human capital that was lost. \n\nThe  legal  assistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building  component  will  provide  relief  to  the  legal  and  documentary \nproblems that earthquake-affected people will encounter. Major targets will be the issue or replacement of identity cards \nand birth, death, and marriage certificates. The component will also provide a legal framework with special provisions for \npeople and property affected by the earthquake, especially vulnerable people. \n\nFinally, the use of labor-intensive techniques in the civil works will provide job opportunities in all affected areas. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                          Proposed Classification:      Poverty intervention\n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nPrior to the earthquake, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) were not the poorest \nregions in the country. They were nevertheless among the most vulnerable to external shocks. Geographical isolation, the \nharshness  and  fragmentation  of  the  land,  the  lack  of  security  as  a  consequence  of  conflicts,  and  adverse  climatic \nconditions put the population at risk of being thrown into poverty. \n\nThe  earthquake  claimed  some  80,000  lives,  almost  half  of  whom  are  thought  to  be  children,  and  some  70,000  were \ninjured,  and  2.8  million  were  left  without  shelter.  Of  the  70,000  who  were  injured,  many  will  be  permanently  disabled. \nMany  of  the  affected  people  will  also  need  counseling.  Crops  and  other  livelihood  assets  were  destroyed,  and  savings \nwere lost. Many communities are completely isolated, and they are particularly threatened by epidemic diseases, famine, \nand cold. Productive human capital was deeply compromised, as was the productive capacity of the affected region as a \nwhole. Risks of abuse, discrimination, and militia recruitment are very high. \n\nThe earthquake had impacts in the short and the long term. In the short term, the lack of food and shelter threatens the \nsurvival of affected people. In the long term, productive capacity is threatened in that many men died, leaving women who \nwill have to enter the labor market, many for the first time. Disabilities will constitute a great burden on affected families \nand the Government.  \n\nA mass of new poor will have to first go through the harshness of winter and then find their way out of poverty. \n\nBefore the earthquake, both NWFP and AJK had relatively few people living on less than $1 per day\u20149.9% in NWFP and \n2.5%  in  AJK,  against  a  national  average  of  13.9%.  Yet  poverty  was  substantial  when  including  those  living  on  $2  per \nday\u201476.2% in NWFP and 51.0% in AJK, against a national average of 69.7%. Hence the extreme vulnerability. \n\nC. \nStakeholder Analysis: No\n\nParticipation Process\n\nParticipation Strategy:  Yes \n\nAll stakeholders will be actively involved in order to reduce the risk of grievance and ensure that benefits are fairly \ndistributed. High rates of participation are also proven to increase ownership. In addition, contractors will discuss the \nselection of unskilled labor in the project area with township labor officials and village leaders to ensure that labor will be\nhired on a nondiscriminatory basis. \n\n\f80\n\nAppendix 13\n\nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women \n\nWomen traditionally suffer discriminated in Pakistan and, in the aftermath of the earthquake, face the burden of providing \nfor  their  families.  Disabilities  place  additional  burdens  on  women  and  other  family  members.  Family  and  household \nstructures  may  need  to  be  recast,  with  many  families  forming  one  household,  other  households  headed  by  one  person \n(female or male), and other families composed of grandparents and grandchildren. Widows will embrace the role of head \nof household, combining the traditional roles of breadwinner and caregiver. \nVocational training will be essential, as will special rehabilitation and training for disabled women. Equal opportunities and \naccess to jobs will be crucial. Equal property rights and proper identification are also very important. Targeted provisions \nare present in the gender action plan for the Project.  \n\nE. \n\nPotential Issues \n\n \n\n \n\nIssues \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nOutput prepared \n\nGender plan prepared? Yes \n\nSignificant/ \nNot-significant/ \nNone \n\nResettlement \n\nNot significant \n\nAll proposed infrastructure development, rehabilitation, \nand  reconstruction  will  be  at  existing  sites  and  on \noriginal  routings  and  alignments.  Buffer  zones  may \nrequire  some  temporary  land  acquisition.  Particular \nattention will be paid to non-titled land users (squatters \ntenants)  and  women.  Special \nand  unregistered \nmechanisms  will  be  arranged  to  overcome  problems \narising  from  the  absence  of  title  deeds  to  land  where \naffected people had user rights. \n\nIn Pakistan, women have always been one of the most \nvulnerable  groups.  The  earthquake  has  exacerbated \ntheir  already  precarious  position.  Particular  attention \nwill be devoted to gender issues in implementing all of \nthe  Project\u2019s  components.  The  institutional  building \ncomponent \nin  particular  will  constitute  a  great \nopportunity to address gender issues nationally. \n\nPeople  will have equal access to public services. The \naffordability of other services will be monitored. \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  short-  and \nlong-term \nemployment  opportunities.  Contractors  will  be  asked \nto  use  labor-intensive  techniques.  Equal  opportunities \nand  wages  will  be  afforded  to  men  and  women, \nregardless  of  ethnicity,  religion,  or  other  factors  that \nhave been grounds for discrimination. \n\narises  mainly \n\nIndigenous  peoples  are  fully  mainstreamed,  and  their \neconomic \nvulnerability \nfrom \ndifferentiation  within \ntribal  communities.

These  will  be \nadequately addressed through resettlement planning. \n\nto \n\nThe  elderly  and  disabled  are  notably  at  risk  of \nmarginalization,  discrimination,  and  abuse.

The  Project  will  employ  a  sector  loan  modality  to  allow  the  selection  of  the  highest \npriority  subprojects  during  implementation.  Based  on  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment, the Project will cover the following sectors: transport, energy, and the social sector \nareas  of  health  and  education.  Due  to  the  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  sample \nsubproject has been selected, so no sample subproject initial environmental examination (IEE) \nis available.  \n\n2. \nThe  Project\u2019s  IEE  provides  overall  preliminary  scoping  and  highlights  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  to  be  further  explored  during  subproject \nformulation.  The  Project\u2019s  IEE  includes  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \nthat provides a set of guidelines on how the environmental assessment for the subprojects will \nbe  prepared  and  reviewed.  This  IEE  was  based  on  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment  and  the  environmental  and  social  screening  framework  prepared  by  the  World \nBank.\n\nB. \n\n Overview of the Project \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  support  reconstruction  and  recovery  from  the  affects  of  the \n3. \nearthquake  with  particular  focus  on  (i)  reconstructing  basic  infrastructure  and  services  and  (ii) \nreviving economic activity in the affected areas. The Project has three sector components. The \nscope of the proposed project components is summarized in Table A14.1. \n\nTable A14.1: The Summary of the Scope of Project Components \n\nProject Component \n\nTransport Sector \n\nEnergy Sector \n\nSocial Sector: Health \n\nScope of Works \n\n(cid:120)  Remove landslide debris and open roads to traffic \n(cid:120)  Restore roads and bridges \n(cid:120) \n(cid:120)  Comprehensively survey to guide planning and prioritization of the \n\nStabilize road embankments to withstand snow \n\nreconstruction and recovery works \n\n(cid:120)  Reconstruct unpaved local roads \n(cid:120)  Reconstruct the main provincial access roads \n(cid:120) \n\nProcure on an emergency basis high- and low-voltage lines, \ntransformers, grid station equipment, and materials for power station \noperational buildings and staff quarters \nElectrify the 10 tent villages and supply power \n\n(cid:120) \n(cid:120)  Repair and reconstruct on an emergency basis damaged electricity \n\nnetworks and related buildings \n\n(cid:120)  Upgrade and expand power systems to improve access for the poor \nand provide electricity to promote economic development in the \nearthquake-affected area \n\n(cid:120)  Reestablish public health centers \n(cid:120) \nProvide services to people living in relief camps and disabled people \n(cid:120)  Reconstruct, repair, and provide equipment for health management \n\noffices and health facilities\n\n\f82\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nProject Component \n\nSocial Sector: \nEducation \n\nScope of Works \n\n(cid:120)  Reconstruct and consolidate schools and resume classes \n\n(cid:120) \n\nimmediately in semi-permanent structures \nSurvey and map where schools are needed and teachers are \navailable\n\n(cid:120)  Reconstruct and repair schools   \n\nC. \n\n Description of the Environment \n\nThe project components will be located in earthquake-affected areas of AJK and NWFP. \n\n4. \nThe general environmental conditions are as follows:  \n\nPhysical Environment. The Project area is part of the mountainous region in the north, \n5. \nin  which  summers  are  temperate  and  winters  intensely  cold.  Rainfall  generally  occurs  in  two \ndistinct crop-growing seasons, from December to March and from June to September, with the \nonset of the summer monsoon in the first or second week of June. In the intervening periods of \nApril-May and October-November, almost no rain falls. The three main rivers in the project area \nare the Jhelum, Kunhar, and Neelum.  \n\n6. \nEcological  Environment.  The Project area is located in the Himalayan Mountains and \nis  famous  for  its  high-altitude  coniferous  and  broad-leaved  forests  and  great  biodiversity. \nForests,  game  reserves,  and  cold  rivers,  lakes,  and  wetlands  characterize  the  landscape. \nAround 4% of the land in AJK has been declared protected forest. The Machiara National Park \nis  located  in  the  heart  of  the  earthquake-affected  area.  In  NWFP,  about  6%  of  the  land  is \ndesignated as protected, with Ayubia National Park located at the periphery of the earthquake-\naffected zone.   \n\n7. \nSocial,  Cultural,  and  Economic  Development.  The  area  most  heavily  damaged  by \nearthquake is home to a scattered population of some 5.7 million people. The social structure in \nthis region is closely knit, with an average of 7 family members per household. About 88% of the \npeople live in the mountains in rural settlements ranging from two households to more than 300. \nThe region\u2019s population is relatively young, with 42% below the age of 15 years and only 6.7% \nabove the age of 60. A high portion of the population lacks basic services, clean drinking water, \nand  safe  waste  disposal.  Agriculture  and  livestock  rearing  are  the  primary  sources  of \nemployment  in  the  rural  areas,  with  most  rural  residents  engaged  in  subsistence  agriculture. \nPublic administration accounts for a significant proportion of employment in the affected urban \nareas, followed by small trading, business, construction, and transport.  \n\nD. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts  \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  reconstruct  and  restore  infrastructure  damaged  or \n8. \ndestroyed  by  the  earthquake  and  is  therefore  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. What adverse environmental impacts there may be will mostly be limited \nto  the  construction  stage.  They  will  affect  a  limited  area  only  over  the  short  term  and  be \nreversible, so the mitigation measures indicated in the attached matrix should be manageable. \n\n9. \nTo address any potential impacts, subprojects will be screened and classified at an early \nstage,  and  an  environmental  assessment  will  be  carried  out.  The  environmental  assessment \nand  review  framework  will  guide  the  preparation  of  the  environmental  assessments  of \nsubprojects.  The  scoping  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  and  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures are presented in Table A14.2. \n\n\fAppendix 14                                          \n83\n\nThe  preliminary  damage  and  needs  assessment  indicates  that  the  following  post-\n\n 10. \nearthquake environmental conditions require consideration:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDebris  and  rubble  need  to  be  removed  before  reconstruction  can  start.  There \nwas evidence of debris and rubble being dumped in rivers adjacent to the cities \nand  along  the  road,  as  well  as  in  open  fields,  drainage  ditches,  and  forested \nareas.  These  practices  should  be  stopped,  and  the  areas  restored.  Dumping  in \nrivers affects the water quality and causes clogging and flooding, and dumping in \nthe  forest  destroys  new  vegetation.  It  is  necessary  to  identify  safe  locations  for \ndisposing of debris and rubble. \nPetroleum  leakage  has  been  a  serious  environmental  problem  since  the \nearthquake.  It  is  estimated  that  around  10,000  liters  of  petroleum  fuel  in \nunderground  storage  have  leaked  due  to  earthquake  damage.  As  water  for \ndrinking  and  irrigation  come  mainly  from  surface  sources,  it  is  therefore \nnecessary to undertake monitoring of surface water contamination. \nLandslides are the main environmental impact of this natural disaster. Landslides \naffect not only slope drainage, but also the habitats of fauna and flora. All project \ncomponents  with  significant  physical  intervention  in  landslide  areas  need  to  be \nproperly prepared by taking this into account. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional  Arrangement  and  Monitoring  Plan  (Environmental  Assessment  and \nReview Framework) \n\nThe  Project  will  be  executed  by  using  sector  modality  and  the  environmental \nfor  project  selection  and \n\n11. \nassessment \nframework,  which  covers  environmental  criteria \nresponsibilities of the parties involve are summarized as follows:    \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Selection of Subprojects  \n\nAs  much  as  possible,  not  to  include  a  category  A  project  in  accordance  to  the  Asian \n12. \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  (2003)  for  the  first \nbatch  of  the  Project.  If  an  environmental  category  A  subproject  needs  to  be  included,  the \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  of  this  particular  subproject  will  need  to  be \nprepared and be disclosed to the public 120 days prior the approval of the subproject. The EIA \nshould  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB  and  Government  of  Pakistan  requirements.  In \naddition, a two-step staff consultations with affected people needs to be carried out. \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirement \n\n13. \nTaking  into  account  the  potential  impacts  related  with  the  follow  up  subprojects,  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  notification  on  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Requirement,  and \nthe  ADB  environmental  assessment  guidelines,  the  environmental  classification  of  the \nsubprojects will be as follows:  \n\n(i) \n\nSubprojects will be categorized A if the subproject generates significant adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  that  requires  a  complex  management  plan,  or  if  the \nsubproject  located  within  or  pass  through:  (a)  wildlife  sanctuaries,  (b)  national \nparks,  (c)  other  sanctuaries,  (d)  areas  declared  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan \nas  environmentally  sensitive,  (e)  areas  of  international  significance  (e.g., \nprotected  wetland  as  designated  by  the  Ramsar  Convention),  or  (f)  areas \nthe  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural \ndesignated  by \nOrganization  (UNESCO)  as  cultural  heritage  sites.  This  type  of  project  requires \nEIA report including an environmental management plan (EMP). \n\n\f84\n\nAppendix 14 \n\n(ii) \n\nA  subproject  will  be  categorized  as  B  if  the  project  is  likely  to  have  an  adverse \nenvironmental  impact,  but  of  lesser  degree  or  significance  than  those  for \ncategory A subprojects and all the mitigation measures to handle the impact are \nmanageable. This type of project will need IEE report including EMP.  \n\n3. \n\nReview  Procedure  for  Environmental  Assessment  of  Subprojects  and \nResponsibilities and Authorities\n\nThe  environmental  assessment  study  for  the  follow  up  subprojects  and  the  review \n14. \nprocedure for the follow up subproject will be carried out to comply with the Government\u2019s and \nADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies. The study will also identify mitigation measures.  \n\n15. \n\nEach implementing agency will assume the following responsibilities: \n(i) \n\nHiring  the  qualified  environmental  consultant  to  prepare  the  environmental \nscreening  to  classify  the  subprojects  in  consultation  with  respective  Provincial \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) either AJK EPA or NWFP EPA. \nConducting  environmental  assessment  study  based  on  the  classification  of  the \nsub  project  with  adequate  consultation  with  affected  people.  For  category  A \nsubproject two step consultation with affected people needs to be carried out. \nFor category B project, each implementing agency responsible for submitting the \nenvironmental screening and environmental assessment report and its summary \nto  the  AJK  EPA  or  NWFP  EPA  for  review  in  order  to  obtain  an  environmental \nclearance  for  execution  of  the  subprojects.  However,  if  the  EPA  AJK  is  not \navailable, the environmental clearance from PEPA should be obtained. \nin \nFor  category  A  project,  aside \n(ii),implementing agency needs to submit also the EIA report and its summary to \nADB  as  soon  as  possible  to  meet  the  120  days  public  disclosure  prior  to \nobtaining an ADB\u2019s approval for this subproject.   \nForwarding the environmental clearance and its conditions to ADB. \nEnsuring that the contract document for implementing each subproject includes: \n(a)  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan \nthe \nenvironmental assessment report, and (b) the environmental clearance certificate \nand its conditions.  \nEnsuring  that  environmental  clearance  certificate  from  NWFP  EPA  or  AJK  EPA \nshould be obtained prior to granting contract award.   \n\nthe  procedure  as  stated \n\nfollowing \n\ntaken \n\nfrom \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  Monitoring  the  implementation  of  environmental  management  plan  throughout \nthe  whole  project  implementation  stage  particularly  during  preparation  of  detail \nengineering design and construction stage and preparing the report in monitoring \nthe implementation of environmental management plan.  \nUndertaking remedial action in close consultation with respective EPA and ADB \nto handle unexpected environmental impacts.  \nSubmitting the monitoring report on EMP to the relevant agencies and ADB. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n16. \n\nADB will assume the following responsibility: \n(i) \n\nProviding  comments  for  the  preparation  of  the  EIA  and  its  summary  of  any \nsubproject that categorized as A project.  \nDisclosing the SEIA report for category A subproject through ADB\u2019s website 120 \ndays prior to approving subproject. \nApproving  subproject  by  taking  into  account  the  environmental  assessment \nreport and conditions of environmental clearance certificates.  \nUndertaking  random  monitoring \nin \nsafeguard policy at any time within the implementation period of the Project. \n\nthe  environmental \n\nimplementation \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\fAppendix 14                                          \n85\n\n(v) \n\n4. \n\nProviding  suggestion  and  recommendations  on  remedial  actions  to  handle \nunexpected environmental impacts.  \n\nEnvironmental  Due  Diligence  to  Ensure  Compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Policy \n\n17. \nThe  Government  should  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake  environmental \nmonitoring for all subprojects, if needed. However, the line department where the subprojects is \nimplemented  has  the  responsibility  for  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  environmental \nmanagement plan for its respective subprojects. The report on monitoring the implementation of \nEMP needs to be systematically documented.   \n\n5. \n\nPublic Disclosure \n\nEach \n\nimplementing  agency \n\n18. \nthat  all  environmental \nassessment documentation, including the monitoring reports, is properly and systematically kept \nas part of the subproject-specific records. \n\nis  responsible \n\nfor  ensuring \n\nAll  environmental  assessment  documents  are  subject  to  public  disclosure  and \n\n19. \ndocuments must be made available to public, if requested. \n\n6. \n\nStaff Requirement and Budget \n\n20. \nEach  implementing  agency  at  present  has  no  environmental  officer,  therefore,  it  has \nbeen  included  in  the  project  implementation  arrangement  that  each  implementing  agency \n(where  required)  and  both  reconstruction  agencies  will  be  supported  with  a  qualified \nenvironmental consultant. \n\nF.   \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n21. \nConsultation with affected people was not specifically done during the preparation of this \nsummary IEE due to the emergency nature of the Project. However, the Government and other \ndonors  were  closely  involved  in  the  preliminary  damage  and  need  assessment,  which  is  the \nbasis  for  preparing  this  summary.  In  addition,  during  the  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment and the Fact-Finding Mission, the proposed environmental assessment and review \nframework  was  discussed,  and  agreement  was  reached  that  it  will  be  implemented  for  the \nsubprojects.  Therefore,  during  subproject  preparation,  especially  when  the  environmental \nassessment is being prepared, consultation with concerned parties will be conducted to comply \nwith the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s requirements.\n\nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendation \n\n22. \nThe  Project  and  its  subprojects  will  focus  on  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating \ninfrastructure. Therefore, it is expected that an adverse environmental impact will mostly occur \nduring  the  construction  phase.  These  impacts  are  insignificant,  short  term,  and  reversible. \nMitigation measures should be integrated into the engineering and construction works as part of \nsubproject design. However, it is necessary to ensure that subprojects meet the Government\u2019s \nand  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  requirements  prior\nto  their  approval  and  that  the \nenvironmental management plan for each subproject is strictly implemented. \n\n\f \n(cid:120)\n\n \n(cid:120)\n\n \n(cid:120)\n\n \n(cid:120)\n\n \n(cid:120)\n\n \n(cid:120)\n\n \n(cid:120)\n\n

will  support  the  efforts  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan  (the \n1. \nGovernment) in the recovery, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of the earthquake-affected areas \nof Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).  \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  assist  the  rehabilitation  of  damaged  or \n2. \ndestroyed  infrastructure  of  the  transport,  power,  and  health  and  education  sectors,  and  will \nprovide legal assistance and support for institutional building. Reconstruction and rehabilitation \nof damaged or destroyed facilities will be done at their original sites. The Government will try to \nuse  its  own  land  if  additional  land  is  required  for  physical  infrastructure.  The  Government  will \nacquire private land only if vacant government-owned land is not available  \n\nResettlement  impacts 1  of  a  specific  subproject  will  be  known  only  during  project \n3. \nimplementation. As a result, the preparation of resettlement plans for such subprojects cannot \nbe  done  before  Board  consideration  of  the  loan  and  grant.  Therefore  the  resettlement \nframework  will  be  part  of  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  and  the  legal \nagreements considered by the Board at project approval. This resettlement framework, agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB, sets out compensation and other entitlements of all project-\naffected  people  as  well  as  how  to  prepare  satisfactory  resettlement  plans  for  subprojects  with \nresettlement impacts.\n\nAmong the earthquake-affected communities are several dominant tribes and subtribes \n4. \nthat  participate  in  mainstream  economic  and  political  activities  and  are  represented  in  public \ninstitutions,  civil  services,  and  educational  institutions.  Social  inequalities  and  vulnerabilities  in \nthese communities usually arise from economic differentiation, as land is owned by a few large, \npowerful families who rent it out to others who cultivate crops and raise livestock. The project is \nunlikely  to  change  this  dominant  mode  of  economic  system.  A  social  assessment 2 will  be \nconducted  focusing  on  the  vulnerabilities  of  all  affected  groups  including  tribal  groups  and \ncultural minorities in the earthquake-affected areas. This is to ensure effective consultations and \nthat  culturally  appropriate  benefits  will  reach  each  affected  group.  As  part  of  this  assessment, \nthe  executing  agency  of  each  subproject  will  examine  the  vulnerability  of  different  groups  in \nterms of potential exclusion from subproject benefits, negative subproject impacts, and the need \nfor  specific  culturally  compatible  mechanisms  for  participation  by  women,  the  permanently \ndisabled, and other vulnerable groups. If any of the above are found in a subproject area, the \nexecuting agency will incorporate adequate measures to address such vulnerabilities in project \ndesign.  If  land  acquisition  or  relocation  becomes  necessary,  people\u2019s  entitlements  will  be \nensured  through  the  resettlement  plan  that  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  approved \nresettlement framework.\n\nB. \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework  \n\nThe  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \n5. \nResettlement  Policy  (IRP),  its  disaster  and  emergency  assistance  policy,  and  the  Land \n                                                \n1   Resettlement  impacts  are  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are  permanent  or  temporary,  and  are  caused  by  (i) \nacquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on land as a \nresult of an ADB operation. \n\n2  The World Bank has planned to conduct a similar social assessment in the affected areas. ADB and World Bank \n\ncould jointly conduct this assessment. \n\n\f90\n\nAppendix 15 \n\nAcquisition  Act  (LAA)  of  1894  (with  amendments).3 Whereas  the  LAA  considers  those  eligible \nfor  compensation  to  be  legal  owners  and  tenants  who  are  registered  with  the  Land  Revenue \nDepartment  or  possess  formal  lease  agreements,  the  IRP  emphasizes  that  the  absence  of \nformal legal title to land is not a bar to entitlements and assistance. The second important policy \nissue  is  that,  while  the  LAA  assesses  compensation  based  on  the  market  value  of  acquired \nproperty, the IRP emphasizes the payment of replacement value of all affected assets. The third \npolicy  issue  is  the  participatory  approach  to  grievance  resolution  provided  by  the  IRP  through \ninformation  disclosure  and  discussions  with  affected  communities,  and  the  appointment  of \nspecial committees such as grievance redress committees. In contrast, under the LAA, the sole \nauthority to resolve disputes lies with the Land Acquisition Collector. Thus the IRP provides for \nconsultation and disclosure of resettlement information much more than does the LAA. The IRP \nemphasizes of rehabilitation of all affected people so that they will not be worse off because of \nland acquisition and resettlement. The LAA does not provide such assistance but does declare \na land owner eligible for a 15% acquisition surcharge and 8% compounded interest per year if \ncompensation payment is delayed.  \n\nHaving  taken  into  consideration  the  above  differences  between  the  LAA  and  IRP,  the \n6. \nfollowing  resettlement  policy  principles  were  adopted  for  the  purpose  of  the  Project.  If  a \nsubproject requires land acquisition or resettlement or both, the executing agency will prepare a \nsatisfactory  resettlement  plan  based  on  the  following  core  principles  and  will  obtain  ADB\u2019s \napproval prior to awarding contracts.\n\nThe  main  involuntary  resettlement  principles  and  procedures  that  are  applicable  to  the \n\n7. \nProject are the following:  \n\n(i) \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided;  if  it  cannot  be  avoided,  it  will  be \nminimized.\n\n(ii)  Where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, affected persons will be assisted \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nin reestablishing themselves and improving their quality of life. \nLack  of  formal  legal  land  title  is  not  a  bar  to  compensation  or  rehabilitation \nassistance under the Project.  \nLand-for-land is an option for compensation in the case of loss of land; however, \nin the absence of replacement land, cash compensation for the property acquired \nwill be paid at its replacement value4 in addition to any transaction costs.  \nEach  affected  person  is  entitled  to  receive  assistance  to  restore  income  and \nlivelihood  to  a  pre-project  standard,  and  all  vulnerable  affected  people  are \nentitled to assistance to improve their income and livelihood.  \nAll  affected  people  will  be  fully  informed  and  consulted  on  compensation  and \nother  entitlements,  relocation  programs,  and  rehabilitation  assistance.  The \nresettlement plan will be posted on the ADB website. \nAffected  people  will  be  fully  involved  in  the  selection  of  relocation  sites,  if  any, \nand livelihood compensation and development options at the earliest opportunity.  \n\n                                                \n3   The  draft  resettlement  policy  and  associate  ordinance  was  prepared  with  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  2002.  These \n\ninstruments have still not been approved by the Government. \n\n4  Replacement  cost  means  the  cost  of  replacing  lost  assets  and  income.  In  the  case  of  land,  it  means  the  cost  of \nbuying  replacement  land  near  the  lost  land  with  equal  productive  potential  plus  the  cost  of  preparing  the  land  to \nlevels similar to those of the affected land and the cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If alternative land is \nnot available in the vicinity of the lost land, it means the cost of buying land with similar attributes and productive \nand/or residential potential plus the cost of preparing the land to levels similar to those of the affected land and cost \nof any registration and transfer taxes. In selecting alternative lands, affected people will be informed and consulted.    \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n91\n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(viii)  All  affected  people  will  be  integrated  economically  and  socially  into  their  host \ncommunities,  if  relocated.  For  this,  participatory  measures  will  be  designed  and \nimplemented by the executing agency.  \nAffected people\u2019s social and cultural institutions will be protected and supported.  \nCommon property resources and community and public services will be provided \nto relocated communities.  \nCompensation  and  rehabilitation  programs  will  be  carried  out  with  equal \nconsideration  for  women  and  men;  in  the  case  of  these  subprojects,  particular \nattention  will  be  paid  to  the  rights  of  women,  widows,  orphans,  the  elderly,  and \nother  vulnerable  people  and  groups  such  as  indigenous  peoples  and  religious \nand  cultural  minorities.  Appropriate  and  sufficient  assistance  will  be  provided  to \nhelp them improve their socioeconomic status.  \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii)  Compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  will  be  fully  provided  before  the \n\napproval of any subproject if it involves resettlement.  \n\n(xiii)  Full compensation and resettlement costs are included in subproject costs.  \n\nC.  \n\nEntitlements \n\nThe  application  of  policies, \n\n8. \nto  displacement, \ndispossession  and  resettlement  is  outlined  below.  The  entitlement  matrix  is  not  exhaustive: \nmore entitlements may be added if any resettlement impact not listed in the matrix is identified \nduring project implementation.

 selection  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment and ADB. The executing agency of a subproject will do its best to avoid or at least \nto minimize land acquisition and resettlement as much as possible. If resettlement impacts are \nunavoidable in implementing a subproject, the executing or implementing agency will formulate \na resettlement plan for the subproject by following the procedure given below: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nInitially categorize anticipated resettlement impacts in consultation with the ADB \nPakistan  Resident  Mission  and  identify  the  financial  and  expert  resources \nrequired to prepare a resettlement plan if resettlement impacts are identified. \nConduct  stakeholder  consultations  to  obtain  their  inputs  regarding  how  to  avoid \nor  at  least  minimize  involuntary  resettlement,  and  to  identify  their  needs  and \npreferences;  undertake  a  social  assessment  to  identify  different  categories  of \naffected people, including indigenous peoples, based on the degree and scale of \nsubproject impacts on them.  \nOutline  an  applicable  policy  and  legal  framework  (if  the  policy  and  legal \nframework  discussed  in  the  resettlement  framework  are  adequate  to  address \nresettlement  impacts,  only  a  summary  of  the  policy  and  legal  framework  is \nrequired, along with a reference to the resettlement framework). \nUndertake a census and complete an asset inventory of all affected people and \nhouseholds,  and  provide  resettlement  information  to  all  affected  people  in  their \nown language. \nDevelop an  entitlements matrix to outline the entitlements of all affected people \nincluding  non-titled  people  (e.g.,  squatters,  encroachers,  tenants,  and  wage \nworkers)  following  the  above  entitlement  matrix  (if  new  categories  of  affected \npeople  and  types  of  losses  are  identified  during  project  implementation, \nappropriate entitlements will be added to the resettlement plan and forwarded to \nADB for review and approval, and all affected people should be informed of such \nchanges).\nExplain  relocation  plans  and  the  rehabilitation  strategy,  including  income \nrestoration and improvement, to affected people.\n\n(vii)  Describe the institutional framework of resettlement programs.\n(viii) \n\nItemize  a  budget  for  all  resettlement  activities  in  the  resettlement  budget  and \nfinancial plan.\nOutline, if applicable, the environmental impacts of relocation.\nFormulate a time-bound schedule for resettlement plan implementation. \nOutline procedures contained in the grievance redress mechanism. \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii)  Describe  both  the  internal  and  external  monitoring  program  and  the  final \n\nevaluation.\n\n(xiii)  Disclose the draft resettlement plan to all affected people in their own language \nand  keep  copies  of  the  documents  at  public  offices;  the  executing  agency  will \nendorse it before submitting it to ADB for review and approval. \n\n(xiv)  Disclose the resettlement plan to all affected people again after ADB\u2019s approval,  \nif it is revised according to ADB\u2019s advice and comments (the plan will be posted \non ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement website). \nAt  a  minimum,  pay  compensation  and  complete  any  required  relocation  before \nawarding subproject construction contracts.  \n\n(xv) \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n95\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n10. \nThe  resettlement  specialists  of  the  safeguard  compliance  group  within  the  project \ncoordination unit will ensure that the each project implementing agency formulates satisfactory \nresettlement  plans  for  each  subproject  with  any  resettlement  impacts.  Each  implementing \nagency  will  have  resettlement  specialists  among  its  consultants  who  will  assist  each \nadministrative  department  or  implementing  agency  with  initial  screening  of  subprojects  for \nresettlement  impacts.  If  any  are  found,  the  resettlement  specialists  will  assist  in  undertaking \nsocial assessments at subproject sites and in formulating resettlement plans, were necessary, \nin accordance with the approved resettlement framework. If significant resettlement impacts are \nidentified, the line department or implementing agency is responsible for engaging resettlement \nspecialists  to  ensure  resettlement  safeguard  compliance  and  for  submitting  satisfactory \nresettlement  plans  to  the  implementing  agency  and  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  any \nacquisition or resettlement of affected persons and the award of civil works contracts.\n\nF. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\n11. \nExecuting  agencies  will  invite  vulnerable  households  and  people  for  stakeholder \nconsultations during the formulation of resettlement plans. The decisions of such meetings will \nbe recorded, and these records will indicate the responsibility and timeline for implementing the \ndecisions.  Each  resettlement  plan  will  include  a  note  on  all  public  consultations  held  and  the \ndisclosure  of  resettlement  information.  During  resettlement  plan  preparation,  resettlement \ninformation  will  be  disclosed  to  all  affected  people  in  their  own  language,  and  their  views  and \nopinions will be taken into consideration in finalizing the plans. Final resettlement plans will be \ntranslated  into  local  languages  and  disclosed  through  public  notices  posted  at  implementing \nagency offices, published in newspapers, and posted on ADB\u2019s website. Affected people will be \nclosely consulted in resettlement site selection and livelihood restoration.  \n\nG. \n\nEligibility Provisions \n\n12. \nAll affected people are entitled to compensation and rehabilitation. However, eligibility to \nreceive  compensation  and  other  assistance  will  be  limited by  a  cut-off date  to  be set  for  each \nsubproject  on  the  day  corresponding  to  the  beginning  of  its  preliminary  impacts  assessment. \nThe cut-off date defines \u201celigibility\u201d and \u201caffected person.\u201d  Given the destruction caused by the \nearthquake, some affected people may have difficulty proving their ownership of, or user rights \nto, any affected property. In such cases, affected people will be assisted and supported under \nthe legal assistance, governance and institutional building activities of the Project. Such support \nwill  include  reissuing  and  replacing  national  identity  cards,  property  titles,  birth  certificates, \ndisability certificates, and marriage certificates. \n\nH. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanism \n\n13. \nThe LAA provides for aggrieved persons at different stages of land acquisition to present \ntheir  grievances  to  the  Land  Acquisition  Collector  or  a  court  of  law  for  redress.  The  executing \nagency  of  each  subproject  with  resettlement  impacts  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \ncommittee  headed  by  the  district  land  acquisition  collector  and  including  among  its  members \nconcerned  union  councils,  local  nongovernment  and  community-based  organizations,  and \ncommunity  leaders.  The  committees  will  be  open  forums  for  raising  objections  and  holding \ndiscussions  to  resolve  conflicts.  Each  committee  will  record  its  deliberations  and  inform  the \nconcerned parties within 4 weeks of its findings and recommendations. \n\n\f96\n\nAppendix 15 \n\nI. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n14. \nSCs,  assisted  by  RAs  will  monitor  compliance  of  resettlement  plans  with  ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary  resettlement  safeguard  requirements  in  subproject  design.  It  will  also  develop  a \ntracking  system  to  ensure  that  necessary  resettlement  plans  are  formulated,  and  submitted  to \nADB for review and approval.  \n\nto  SC.  A  private \n\n15. \nEach  resettlement  plan  will  include  monitoring\u2014internal  and  external\u2014indicators.  The \nEA  will  conduct  its  own  internal  monitoring  of  RP  implementation  and  will  submit  quarterly \nreports \nfirm,  NGO,  or  university  will  be  engaged  by  executing \nagency/implementing  agency  as  an  external  monitor.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted quarterly during the first year of subproject implementation, and twice a year from the \nsecond year to SC. SC will submit these reports to ERRA and ADB for review. There will be a \nseparate  section  in  the  project\u2019s  midterm  review  report  on  the  progress  in  resettlement \nimplementation in the entire project.  \n\nJ. \n\nResettlement Budget \n\n16. \nThe  ERRA  will  be  responsible  for  providing  adequate  funds  for  land  acquisition  and \nrelocation  arising  from  subprojects.  Detailed  estimates  will  be  prepared  by  executing \nagency/implementing  agency  for  each  RP,  which  will  be  included  in  the  overall  subproject \nestimate. The budget will include (i) detailed costs of land acquisition, relocation, and livelihood \nand income restoration and improvement; (ii) sources and availability of adequate funding; (iii) \narrangements  for  approval  of  RP  cost  estimates;  and  (iv)  the  flow  of  funds  and  contingency \narrangements.  \n\n17. \nLand acquisition and resettlement are state government\u2019s responsibility. However, under \nthe  Project, state  governments  might  find  difficult  to  pay  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nTherefore,  in  each  subproject,  it  is  necessary  to  indicate  who  will  fund  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement costs. Costs of physical infrastructure at relocation sites and income and livelihood \nrestoration  and  improvement  programs  could  be  financed  from  grant  funds  provided  such \nfinancing  has  in-built  check  and  balances  to  ensure  ADB\u2019s  requirements  are  met.  All  land \nacquisition,  compensation,  relocation  and  rehabilitation  of  income  and  livelihood  will  be \nconsidered as an integral component of project costs.  \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n97\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\nThe earthquake in northern Pakistan has disrupted lives of 1.6 to 2.2 million women and \n1. \nchildren.  Already  considered  particularly  vulnerable,  they  have  now  lost  homes,  assets,  and \nfamily  members,  becoming  widows  or  orphans.  Many  of  those  who  survived  are  injured,  and \nsome are permanently disabled physically and/or psychologically even as they are left without a \nsupport  network.  Many  are  at  risk  due  to  cold,  malnutrition,  disease,  and  a  lack  of  access  to \nresources  and  assets  to  address  their  situation.  Most  were  never  registered  and  lack  the \nidentification  documents  they  need  to  reclaim  their  properties  or  inherit  them  from  family \nmembers the have lost.  \n\n2. \nWomen  and  children  in  these  precarious  conditions  are  also  at  risk  of  physical  and/or \npsychological  abuse  and  violence  and  progressive  marginalization.  In  addition,  children  are  at \nrisk,  especially  in  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK),  of  being  recruited  by  militias  to  escape \nextreme poverty and famine. \n\nB. \n\nThe Gender Action Plan \n\nThe  objectives  of  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  are  to  promote  and  enable  the  equal \n3. \nparticipation  of  men  and  women  stakeholders  as  agents  and  beneficiaries  of  the  Pakistan \nEarthquake  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (the  Project).  The  GAP  is  based  on  analyses  of \ngender  disparity  and  the  gender  dimension  of  poverty  in  Pakistan.  In  Pakistan,  women  are \nparticularly disadvantaged, suffering discrimination in the social, cultural, economic, and political \nspheres  of  life  and  denied  equal  access  to  resources,  services,  and  opportunities  that  will \nenable them to participate in, contribute to, and benefit fully from development processes in the \ncountry. Women have different legal status from men. For these reasons women are particularly \nvulnerable,  especially  in  the  aftermath  of  a  catastrophic  event  such  as  the  earthquake.  The \nProject  will  encourage  and  support  women\u2019s  increased  participation  in  the  consultative \nprocesses  of  planning  and  implementing  the  various  activities  to  be  carried  out  within  the \ndifferent  sectors  through  the  loan  project  components  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  the  GAP  will \ndevelop  measures  to  mitigate  the  risks  deriving  from  the  situation.

The  capacity  of \nimplementing  agencies  and  units  will  be  strengthened  under  the  implementation  assistance \ncomponent,  and  the  support  of  consultants  will  be  obtained,  where  necessary,  to  enable  the \neffective implementation of the GAP. \n\nD. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n5. \nGender-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  during  project  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nMonitoring  systems  will  incorporate  such  data,  and  processes  of  review  and  evaluation  will \ncover both quantitative and qualitative gender-based information. \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n101\n\nVULNERABLE PEOPLE ACTION PLAN \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe earthquake-affected areas of Pakistan were not the poorest in the country, but they \n1. \nwere  among  the  most  vulnerable.  Years  of  conflict  in  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK)  and \nneighboring  Afghanistan,  geographical  remoteness,  and  climatic  harshness  have  made  these \nareas particularly vulnerable.\n\n2. \nThe earthquake exacerbated the plight of the existing marginalized groups while creating \nnew ones. Both existing and newly marginalized groups may not be able to access assistance \non an equal basis. In particular, female-headed households, widows, and orphaned children are \nat risk of having little or no access to supplies and services and of losing property claims, often \nbecause they lack proper identification. The elderly and the disabled are likely to have lost their \nsupport network, notably family members. Physical and psychological disabilities caused by the \nearthquake need to be taken into account, as they carry long-term effects in terms of economic \ncosts  and  social  exclusion.  Long-term  health  expenses  and  rehabilitation  will  be  important \nburdens for families and the Government alike. \n\nB. \n\nThe Action Plan \n\n3. \nThe  empowerment  of  those  affected  by  the  earthquake  needs  to  be  integrated  into  all \nproject  interventions.  The  need  to  (i)  protect  the  vulnerable  from  exploitation,  violence,  and \nabuse; (ii)  ensure their access to entitlements and assets; and (iii) ensure the inclusion of the \ndisabled in education, vocational training, and employment schemes are guiding principles that \nneed  to  be  communicated  to  policymakers,  public  servants,  camp  managers,  the  media, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  affected  and  displaced  people  themselves.  These  actions \nneed  to  be  implemented  using  a  rights-based  approach,  with  institutional  building  activities \nlegally supporting such changes. \n\n4. \nThe  objectives  of  this  action  plan  are  to  promote  and  enable  the  equal  participation  of \nvulnerable  stakeholders  as  agents  and  beneficiaries  of  the  Pakistan  Earthquake  Emergency \nAssistance Project (the Project). These groups are particularly disadvantaged and discriminated \nagainst  in  the  social,  cultural,  economic,  and  political  spheres  of  life,  and  are  denied  equal \naccess  to  resources,  services,  social  and  official  structures,  and  opportunities  that  will  enable \nthem to participate in, contribute to, and fully benefit from development processes in the country. \nThe  Project  will  encourage  and  support  vulnerable  people\u2019s  increased  participation  in  the \nconsultative processes of planning and implementing the various activities to be carried out in \nthe  loan  components  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  the  action  plan  will  develop  measures  to \nmitigate  the  risks  arising  from  the  post-earthquake  situation.  This  action  plan  will  guide  the \ndevelopment  of  provisions  under  the  legal  assistance,  governance,  and  institutional  building \ncomponent with particular attention to all vulnerable groups. The action plan will focus particular \nattention on the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nequal participation of all vulnerable people in reconstruction planning; \nrecovery  of  livelihood  and  economic  activity  for  the  vulnerable,  particularly  the \ndisabled and those who have lost their support networks; \nequal  access  for  vulnerable  groups  to  infrastructure  activities  in  relation  to \nplanning and, where possible, construction, use, and maintenance; \nequal  compensation  to  vulnerable  people  for  land  acquired  under  the  project \ncomponents; and \n\n\f102\n\nAppendix 17 \n\n(v) \n\nequal  wages \nrehabilitation activities. \n\nfor  workers \n\nfrom  vulnerable  groups \n\nin  reconstruction  and \n\n5. \n\nVulnerable people include the following: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nfemale-headed households (also covered by the GAP); \nwidows (also covered by the GAP); \norphaned children;  \nthe elderly, especially those who have lost their support network; \nthe  physically  and/or  psychologically  disabled,  especially  those  who  have  lost \ntheir support network;  \nethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities; \nnomadic tribes in the effected areas; \npeople living in extreme poverty; and \ninternally displaced people, particularly minors. \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n\n2.

The \ncapacity  of  implementing  agencies  and  units  will  be  strengthened  under  the  implementation \nassistance  component,  and  support  from  consultants  will  be  obtained,  where  necessary,  to \nenable the effective implementation of this action plan. \n\nD. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nData disaggregated for vulnerability\u2014particularly for people living under the poverty line \n7. \nand  the  elderly  and  disabled\u2014will  be  collected  during  project  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nMonitoring  systems  will  incorporate  such  data,  and  processes  of  review  and  evaluation  will \ncover information on vulnerable people both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\n\f104\n\nAppendix 18 \n\nA.  \n\nBackground \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES FOR PROVIDING \nCAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF PAKISTAN \n\n1. \nWith  reference  to  accounting  and  audit,  each  executing  agency  and  implementing \nagency  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  works,  goods,  and  services \nfinanced  by  the  loan  proceeds.  Specifically,  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation \nAuthority  (ERRA)  and  each  executing  agency/implementing  agency  will  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  Project  and  ensure  project  accounts  are  audited  annually  and  submitted  to \nADB. Given the relatively high degree of fiduciary risk associated with this Project, the audited \naccounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  provided  to  ADB  within  4  months  of  the  end  of  the \nfiscal  year.  The  auditing  requirement  has  been  harmonized  with  that  of  the  World  Bank. \nAlthough both institutions typically required submission of audited financial statements within 6 \nmonths,  it  was  felt  that  the  risks  associated  with  this  transaction  together  with  a  36-month \nimplementation period warranted a slightly tighter deadline for submission. \n\ninstitutionalise \n\nfinancial  management  systems  and  procedures \n\n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance,  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  (AGP)  and  Controller  General  of \nAccounts  (CGA)  are  working  with  ERRA,  as  the  client  for  services  of  the  AGP  and  CGA,  to \ndevelop  and \nincluding \naccounting systems that will produce auditable accounts and financial and performance auditing \narrangements  governing  all  resources  for  post-quake  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  This \ninvolves  revising  existing  government  systems  and  procedures  to  address  the  specific  scope, \nscale and timing requirements of the earthquake response. With regard to accounts, the CGA \nwill approve the accounting system, including financial management. ERRA and implementing \nagencies  will  maintain  accounts  in  accordance  with  the  new  accounting  model  (NAM).  The \naccounts  will  be  computerized  providing  auditable  information  to  track  expenditure  by \nimplementing agency, donor, district, province/state and activity. ERRA will follow this model for \nits own accounts, and to aggregate implementing agencies\u2019 accounts.  \n\n3. \nThe  AGP  audit  jurisdiction  will  extend  to  all  agencies  involved  in  post-quake \nrehabilitation and reconstruction operations. The AGP will conduct an annual financial audit and \nperiodic  compliance  with  authority  and  performance  audits.  The  AGP  carries  out  audits  in \naccordance  with  the  International  Organisation  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  (INTOSAI) \nstandards. In order to meet the increased workload demands of these responsibilities the AGP \nis establishing a team of auditors headed by a Director General ERRA Audit with three offices in \nAbbottabad, Islamabad, and Muzaffarabad. The AGP is empowered to hire incremental staff as \nrequired.\n\n4 \nERRA is developing an earthquake monitoring and evaluation framework based on five \ncore principles: (i) joint and harmonized monitoring and evaluation; (ii) results focus; (iii) lesson \nlearning;  (iv)  people  focus;  and  (v)  transparency  and  communication.  ERRA  will  establish  a \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  for  the  Earthquake  Emergency  Assistance \nProject  loan  and  grant  funded  activities  and  outcomes.  ERRA  will  need  to  ensure  that \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  systems  for  earthquake  recovery  activities  are  coherent,  provide \ninformation to enable timely preparation of reports for management and donors and ensure that \nimplementation lessons inform policy makers. \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n105\n\nB.  \n\nScope of Services \n\n5. \n\nThis TA has three components. \n\n1. \n\nAuditable Accounts (Component 1) \n\n6. \nThis includes CGA support to ERRA to design and implement the financial management \nsystem consistent with the NAM through a packaged solution configured in software (SAP R3) \nconsistent  with  the  on-going  World  Bank  funded  project  to  improve  financial  reporting  and \nauditing  (PIFRA).  This  will  include  computerization  of  the  financial  accounting  and  budgeting \nsystem at the point of expenditure. ERRA will be required to aggregate of financial reports from \nthree  types  of  agencies  receiving  funds  against  approved  schemes:  (i)  existing  government \nimplementing agencies e.g. Frontier Works Organisation, National Housing Authority, Water and \nPower  Development  Authority,  etc.;  (ii)  NGOs  and  other  civil  society  organisations;  and  (iii) \nproposed  province/state  and  district  level  \u2018reconstruction  institutions\u2019.  The  CGA,  ERRA  and \nimplementing  agencies  will  require  targeted  technical  assistance  in  areas  such  as  system \ndesign and computerization of accounts, and training of over 150 officers. \n\n2. \n\nFinancial, Compliance and Performance Audits (Component 2) \n\nThis  includes  capacity  development  of  the  newly  established  DG  Audit  ERRA  office \n7. \nwithin the AGP to ensure that timely and accurate audit reports are prepared. Technical support \nand  training  of  over  120  auditors  is  required  by  the  AGP  in  three  areas:  (i)  conducting \ninformation  systems  audit  including  updating  manuals  and  working  papers;  (ii)  instituting \nstrategic  audit  planning,  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  systems  including  developing  an \naudit  plan,  establishing  a  quality  assurance  cell  and  reviewing  the  process  life  cycle  of  audit \nreports; and (iii) developing guidelines for procurement audit including conducting procurement \naudit of sample large schemes and developing case studies and training in donor (ADB, World \nBank etc.) procurement procedures. A study tour for selected senior officials to visit a tsunami-\naffected country(s) to discuss audit and accounting responses is proposed. \n\n3. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation (Component 3) \n\n8. \nERRA  is  developing  an  earthquake  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework.  Technical \nassistance will be provided to ensure that the Earthquake Emergency  Assistance Project loan \nand  grant  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  is  integral  to  the  broader  ERRA  framework  and \nprovides timely information for ADB and government. \n\nC.  \n\nStaffing \n\nA total of 192 person-months of domestic and 9 person-months of international, long and \n9. \nshort term, individual consultants are proposed. This includes 36 person-months for a domestic \nproject coordinator. Consultants will provide training and technical advice in various aspects of \naudit,  accounts  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  It  is  expected  that  domestic \nconsultants providing technical advice in audit and accounts will be drawn from the pool of ex-\nAGP and CGA officers.\n\nD.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n10. \nscheduled \n\nThe  AGP  and  CGA  will  be  the  executing  agencies  for  the  TA.  The  proposed  TA  is \nto  January  2009.  \n\nfrom  January  2006 \n\nfor  36  months \n\nimplemented \n\nto  be \n\n\f106\n\nAppendix 18 \n\nAdministration of the proposed TA will be delegated to the ADB PRM. It is proposed to establish \nan  advisory  committee  with  representatives  of  AGP,  CGA  and  ERRA  chaired  by  ADB  to  (i) \nassist  in  short-listing,  including  provision  of  the  Government\u2019s  concurrence  of  consultants;  (ii) \napprove  progress  and  annual  reports;  and  (iii)  provide  guidance  to  the  team  of  consultants \nrecruited under the proposed TA. The Governance Unit, PRM will provide secretariat services to \nthe  advisory  committee.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  consultants.  Procurement  of  equipment  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for procurement. \n\nE.  \n\nReporting and Documentation Requirements \n\nBiannual  reports  prepared  by  the  Governance  Unit  secretariat  will  be  endorsed  by  the \n\n11. \nadvisory committee prior to submission to the Government and ADB. \n\nF.  \n\nGovernment Inputs \n\n12. \nThe  AGP,  CGA  and  ERRA  will  provide  consultants  with  suitable  office  space  and \ncounterpart  staff,  local  communications,  office  support  staff  and  necessary  equipment  to \nconduct their mandated responsibilities.
