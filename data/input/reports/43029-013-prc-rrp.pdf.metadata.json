The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Restoration  of Wetlands  in  Dalai \nLake  National  Nature  Reserve  of  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA.1 \n\n2. \nThe following activities will be undertaken under the project: (i) upgrade a section of the \nprovincial highway in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) of the PRC, (ii) upgrade rural \nroads, (iii) facilitate cross-border transport and trade, (iv) support community-based sustainable \ntourism and environmental conservation, and (v) strengthen institutional capacity.2  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nIMAR  is  the  third-largest  administrative  region  of  the  PRC  in  terms  of  land  area  and  is \nwell endowed with natural resources. As a result of mining, IMAR\u2019s economy has been growing \nrapidly,  with  gross  domestic  product  increasing  at  18%  per  annum  from  2003  to  2011.  The \nproposed  project  is  located  in  Hulunbeier,  one  of  the  fast-growing  areas  of  IMAR.3 Hulunbeier \ncovers  253,000  square  kilometers  and  is  very  sparsely  populated  (fewer  than  4  million \ninhabitants). It borders the PRC\u2019s Heilongjiang province, the Russian Federation, and Mongolia. \nIts economy depends heavily on resource extraction industries (coal, oil, and various minerals), \nanimal  husbandry,  trade  with  the  Russian  Federation  and  to  a  lesser  extent  Mongolia,  and  a \ndeveloping  tourism  industry.  Considerable  infrastructure  improvements  are  needed  to  support \nfurther economic growth. \n\n4. \nThe demand for transport in IMAR has grown in line with economic growth. Rail freight \nincreased  from  181  million  tons  in  2005  to  646  million  tons  in  2011.  Similarly,  highway  freight \ntraffic  increased  from  510  million  tons  in  2005  to  more  than  1  billion  tons  in  2011.  Road \nconditions  in  IMAR  are  lagging  behind  the  rest  of  the  PRC.  In  2010,  the  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region Department of Transport (IMDT) estimated that only 58.5% of the region\u2019s \nroads  were  in  good  or  excellent  condition,  against  the  national  average  of  75.8%.  There  is  a \nbacklog of roads needing rehabilitation or upgrades. IMAR needs to prioritize upgrades to cater \nfor increased traffic and increase maintenance financing to ensure sustainability. \n\n5. \nProvincial  highway  S203.  The  main  road  in  Hulunbeier  is  provincial  highway  S203, \nwhich  starts  at  Manzhouli  city  and  is  496 kilometers  (km)  long. The  section from  Manzhouli  to \nAlatanemole  conforms  to  PRC  highway  class  III  standard4 and  is  in  relatively  poor  condition. \nThere  are  numerous  sections  where  the  pavement  is  buckling  and  settling,  which  limits \noperating  speeds.  Traffic  on  the  road  is  mainly  trucks  to  and  from  regional  land  ports;  trucks \ncarrying timber, coal, and other minerals; agricultural vehicles; tourist and local buses; and local \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2009.  Technical \n\nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Inner Mongolia Road Development Project. Manila. \n\n3  Hulunbeier  is  governed  as  a  prefecture-level  city.  Its  administrative  center  is  located  at  Hailar  district,  its  largest \n\n4  See Technical Note on Highway Classification System in the People\u2019s Republic of China (accessible from the list of \n\nurban area. \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fprivate  vehicles.  The  development  of  a  new  industrial  park  south  of  Manzhouli  is  expected  to \nlead to further traffic growth, including heavy trucks on the provincial highway. The existing road \nwill not be able to handle the projected volume of traffic.  \n\nRegional integration and cross-border transport. The principal border-crossing point \n6. \nfor  the  region  is  on  the  Russian  Federation\u2019s  border  at  Manzhouli,  which  handles  60%  of  the \nPRC\u2019s  overland  trade  with  the  Russian  Federation.  The  two  border-crossing  points  with \nMongolia\u2014at  Arihasate  and  Ebuduge\u2014are  well  established  and  are  expected  to  grow \nsignificantly in the future. PRC-based companies are actively pursuing potential projects across \nthe  border  in  Mongolia,  which  is  expected  to  lead  to  increased  import  traffic.  However,  within \nIMAR, connectivity with these border crossings is inadequate. Existing roads are narrow and in \npoor condition and cannot support movement of heavy trucks. The roads to the border-crossing \npoints also need to be improved because they include links to the Asian Highway network.5 The \nChoibalsan\u2013Manzhouli\u2013Chita  corridor,  mainly  consisting  of  provincial  highway  S203,  is \npotentially  a  key  conduit  between  Asian  highway  routes  AH6  and  AH32, giving  shippers  more \nroute choices  and motivating  countries  to  compete for transit traffic. The  planned  extension  of \nthe  Alatanemole\u2013Arihasate  road  to  Choibalsan  and  beyond  to  Ulaanbaatar  in  Mongolia  will \nstrengthen  regional  links  as  it  will  connect  to  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \ncorridor 4b, which is also Asian highway route AH3. \n\nRoad  safety.  Road  safety  is  a  major  problem  in  the  PRC,  with  an  estimated  210,000 \n7. \naccidents and 62,000 fatalities in 2011. In IMAR, the accident rate in 2009 was 9.4 fatalities per \n100,000 people, nearly twice the PRC average of 5.1. Accidents are also more severe in IMAR, \nwith  the ratio  of fatalities  to  injuries  being four  times  higher  than  in  the  rest  of  the  PRC.  Road \nconditions  are  a  major  determinant  of  IMAR\u2019s  higher  accident  rates,  particularly  on  medium-\nclass roads (class III). Because of the flatness of the plains, these roads have good geometry, \nenabling  speeds  of  up  to  120  km  per  hour.  However,  they  also  tend  to  be  narrow,  lack \nshoulders,  and  are  elevated  above the  plain  without  safety  barriers. These factors  make them \npotentially dangerous, especially when high speeds are involved.  \n\n8. \nRural  roads.  The  region  is  home  to  a  number  of  ethnic  minorities  who  live  in  small \nvillages  and  towns,  most  of  which  can  only  be  accessed  via  unpaved  roads  which  become \ntreacherous during winter. The hardships of extreme cold are compounded by the occurrence of \nsnowstorms  and  blizzards.  The  low  population  density  implies  that  the  region  requires  a \nrelatively  large  stock  of  road  infrastructure  compared  to  other  parts  of  the  PRC  in  order  to \nensure access for isolated communities. However, road density per 1,000 square kilometers is \nonly 139 km, as against the PRC average of 426 km. Providing paved roads will improve access \nto jobs, education, and health services for poor rural communities. \n\n9. \nEnvironmental  conservation. Hulunbeier has some of the largest and most significant \ngrassland  and  wetland  ecosystems  in  the  region.  A  major  geographical  feature  in  the \nHulunbeier landscape is Dalai Lake, one of the five largest freshwater lakes in the PRC. Dalai \nLake  and  associated  wetland  and  grassland  ecosystems  form  part  of  the  Dalai  Lake  National \nNature  Reserve  (NNR). Since  2000  there  has  been  a general  pattern  of falling  water  levels  in \nDalai lake and shallow water wetlands and marshes have become desiccated. Increases in the \nnumbers  of  visitors  and  tourists  entering  the  NNR  are  also  expected  to  increase  pressure  on \nnatural  resources,  habitats,  and  species  within  the  reserve.  The  Dalai  Lake  National  Nature \n\n                                                 \n5  The  Asian  Highway  network  aims  to  promote  development  of  international  road  transport  in  the  region.  The \n\nnetwork includes 141,000 km of standardized roadways in 32 Asian countries with linkages to Europe. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fReserve  Management Bureau (NNR Bureau) needs to strengthen protection and conservation \nof the reserve and promote sustainable tourism activities. \n\n10. \nClimate  change.  Hulunbeier  is  in  the  southernmost  area  of  the  northern  hemisphere \npermafrost zone and has discontinuous and/or sporadic permafrost.6 It is expected that climate \nchange  will  lead  to  thawing  of  permafrost  which  can  threaten  the  structural  integrity  of  road \ninfrastructure.  Infrastructure  projects  in  the  region  need  to  factor-in  climate  change  during  the \nplanning and design phases to ensure that the projects are climate resilient. \n\nThe  project  will  address  aforementioned  regional  development, \n\n11. \ntransport,  and \nenvironmental  needs.  It  will  also  support  the  government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy7 and Northeast Region and Other Old Industrial Bases Revitalization Strategy.8 It is in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  objectives  in  the  country  partnership  strategy9 and  its  support  for  road  safety, \nrural  roads,  environmental  conservation,  and  cross-border  transport  aligns  it  with  the  core \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative.10  \n\nfor \n\nLessons  from  recent  road  projects  in  the  PRC  have  included  the  need  to  provide \n12. \ncapacity  building  support \nimplementation  units,  particularly  on  procurement  and \nsafeguards,11 and  for  incorporating  complementary  support  to  local  communities  by  providing \nassistance to improve community facilities.12 These lessons were reflected in the project design \nin  that  (i)  guidance  was  provided  to  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  on  ADB \nprocedures  on  safeguards  and  procurement;  (ii)  extensive  community  consultation  was \nundertaken during project preparation; and (iii) facilities for communities, such as procurement \nof  rescue  and  relief  equipment  for  use  during  extreme  weather  events,  were  included  in  the \nproject design.  \n\nThe  project  design  also  drew  upon  ADB\u2019s  2007  sector  assistance  program  evaluation \n13. \nrecommendation  of  prioritizing  value  adding  in  PRC  road  projects. 13  The  project  has  the \nfollowing  value-addition  components:  (i)  safer  road  designs  to  ensure  that  project  roads  and \nbridges conform to best practices in road safety, (ii) upgrades of roads to border-crossing points \nand trade facilitation to improve regional trade links, (iii) bus terminals and bus stops in project \narea \ntourism  and \nenvironmental conservation, and (v) training in road safety audits and road maintenance.  \n\nto  promote  sustainable \n\ntransport,  (iv) measures \n\nto  promote  public \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  the  efficient,  inclusive,  and  safe  movement  of  people \n14. \nand  goods  in  IMAR  and  across  the  borders  of  the  Russian  Federation  and  Mongolia.  The \nproject  outcome  will  be  the  development  of  a  safe  and  efficient  road  transport  network  that \nsupports environmental conservation and sustainable tourism. \n\n                                                 \n6  Permafrost  is  defined  as  ground  (soil  or  rock  and  included  ice  or  organic  material)  that  remains  at  or  below  0 \n\ndegrees Celsius for at least 2 consecutive years.  \n\n7  The strategy covers six provinces and five autonomous regions including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n8  Five eastern prefectures of Inner Mongolia are included: Xilin Gol, Chifeng, Tongliao, Hinggan, and Hulunbeier. \n9  ADB. 2012.

A  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established \nunder the implementing agency and it is staffed with experienced people, some with experience \nof  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.19 The  PMO  will  oversee  and  manage  the \nimplementation  of  all  project  activities  under  the  guidance  of  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies. The PMO will be responsible for all procurement activities under the project, and will \nselect  an  experienced  procurement  agent  (tendering  company)  to  support  the  procurement \nactivities. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the project administration manual.20 \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nApril 2013\u2013December 2017 \n31 December 2017 (Loan closing date: 30 June 2018 ) \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion \ndate \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body \n(ii)Executing agency \n(iii)Implementing agency  Hulunbeier Bureau of Transport \nProcurement \n\n \nIMAR government \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region Department of Transport \n\n \n \nConsulting services \n\nTraining \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\n$233.38 million \n$83.22 million \n$4.03 million \n$0.67 million \n$1.00 million \n\nInternational competitive bidding  Works: 12 contracts \nWorks: 31 contracts \nNational competitive bidding \nGoods: 9 contracts \n \nShopping \nGoods: 10 contracts \nIndividual consultant selection and consulting firm (quality-  \nand cost-based selection, 80:20) \nDomestic  \nOverseas \nFirst  advance  contracting  was  approved  on  17  December  2012  and  second  advance \ncontracting on 18 June 2013.

The TA  is  estimated to cost  $500,000,  which \nwill  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund22 under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of staff, office, and other in-kind contributions. It will be implemented alongside the \nproject over an 18-month period from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2015. The NNR Bureau will be \nthe executing agency for the TA. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nEquipment  purchased  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and transferred to the NNR Bureau upon TA \ncompletion. The TA is described in more detail in supplementary document 18.23 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n26. \nThe project includes highways of class I, II, III, and IV (PRC road standard classes). The \ndesign  for  the  S203  highway  will  be  based  on  class  I  highway  standard,  with  appropriate \nadjustments,  particularly  safety  features,  to  allow  two-way  traffic.  Road  safety  audits  will  be \nconducted  on  the  detailed  designs  during  and  after  construction  to  ensure  compliance  with \nrequired  road  safety  standards.  The  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  is \nconsidered adequate to implement the project\u2019s technical aspects based on the performance on \npast projects. The due diligence highlighted the need to factor-in the hydrological and ecological \nfunctions of the wetlands in the detailed bridge designs. A hydrologist and design engineer will \nassist and advise the PMO on this aspect.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n27. \nThe  project  is  economically  viable.  Its  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \n13.2%  and  the  net  present  economic  value  is  $37.9  million  at  a  12%  discount  rate.  Improved \ndriving  conditions  due  to  smoother  road  surfaces  will  shorten  travel  times  by  5%\u201350% \ndepending  on  vehicle  type  and  road  section.  Vehicle  operating  costs  will  be  reduced.  In  the \ncase of road sections upgraded from dirt track to paved road standard, vehicle operating costs \nwill be up to 35% lower. Shorter travel time and reduced vehicle operating costs will enable local \neconomic development and facilitate development of cross-border trade. The economic internal \nrate of return is robust to increases in capital costs but sensitive to traffic growth assumptions. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  understates  the  expected  economic  contribution  of  the \nproject since it is also expected to have significant unquantified benefits, particularly for cross-\nborder trade with the eastern part of Mongolia.  \n\n28. \nThe  project  roads  will  be  constructed  and  operated  by  the  IMDT,  which  is  a \nnoncommercial  government  agency,  and  will  be  nonrevenue  earning.  The  financial  analysis \nconfirmed  that  the  IMDT  will  have  sufficient  revenues  to  repay  the  loan  and  finance  the \noperation and maintenance of the project roads. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \n                                                 \n22 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n23 Technical  Assistance\u2013Restoration  of  Wetlands  in  Dalai  Lake  National  Nature  Reserve  of  Inner  Mongolia \n\nAutonomous Region (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\famended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies,  and  the  PMO.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual.  An  assessment  of  financial \nmanagement  capacity  indicates  that  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  closely  follow \nPRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and  financial  management.  The  implementing \nagency  has  strong  accounting  and  financial  management  capacity,  as  well  as  experience  in \nmanaging multiple large construction projects. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nA social impact analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines. While IMAR \nhas achieved high economic growth, rural per capita incomes lag behind the rest of the PRC. In \n2011, the average per capita income in rural areas was CNY6,642, which was lower than in the \nneighboring  provinces  of  Heilongjiang,  Jilin,  and  Liaoning. 24  One  of  the  three  project  qi \n(counties), Xinzuo Qi, is designated poor under the provincial poverty criteria. Using the IMAR \npoverty standard of CNY3,100 for the rural population, the rural poverty rate in 2011 was 59.5% \nfor  Xinzuo  Qi  and  25.5%  for  Xinyou  Qi. 25 Poor  infrastructure,  lack  of  nonfarm  employment \nopportunities and skills, and frequent natural disasters such as snowstorms are among the main \ncauses of poverty. \n\n31. \nThe project will result in better road connectivity, reduce various transport-related costs \nand  travel  time,  and  improve  access  to  economic  and  employment  opportunities  and  social \nservices.  It  will  stimulate  investment  in  the  area  and  promote  industrial  growth,  cross-border \ntrade, tourism  development,  and  nonfarm  employment.  Rural roads  will  improve the  access of \nrural communities to more diverse, nonpastoral livelihoods and  will also result in higher profits \nfrom  livestock  and  farm  products.  Rural  roads  will  ensure  year-round  road  connectivity, \nincluding  rescue  and  relief  operations  during  snowstorms,  enhancing  the  resilience  of  local \npeople to such shocks that often result in their impoverishment. \n\n32. \nGender.  Within  the  project  area,  women  have  particular  transport  needs  arising  from \ntheir  various  gender  roles  and  patterns  of  mobility,  and  from  combining  farm  work  and/or \nemployment  with  travel  to  markets,  health  clinics,  and  other  services.  To  ensure  that  women \nbenefit equally, a gender action plan will be implemented to ensure that women (i) participate in \nproject  activities  and  decision-making  processes;  (ii)  benefit  from  employment  opportunities \ncreated  by  the  project;  and  (iii)  participate  in  capacity  development  measures,  particularly \nimprovement  measures  such  as  community-based  ecotourism  development. \nlivelihood \nImplementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  will  be  monitored  through  collection  of  gender-\ndisaggregated data on project activities.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nindigenous peoples. \n\nThe  project  is  classified  A  for  environment,  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  A  for \n\n34. \nEnvironment.  A consolidated environmental impact assessment and an environmental \nmanagement plan were prepared for the seven project roads and a linked road that is treated as \nan  associated facility. These  documents  comply  with  PRC  regulatory  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n24 Per capita rural income for Heilongjiang is CNY7,591, for Jilin CNY7,510, and for Liaoning CNY8,297.  \n25 This standard is higher than the PRC\u2019s national poverty line of CNY2,300 per capita.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and were disclosed on the ADB website on 14 December \n2012. The most significant environmental risk is the potential for adverse impacts on sensitive \nwetland and grassland habitats, Dalai Lake NNR, and a local cultural artifact, the Genghis Khan \nsidewall. Through the environmental management plan, 4% of the project budget is allocated for \nimpacts. \nimplementation  of  environmental  management  measures \nEnvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism \nestablished for the  project.  Impacts  and  risks  will  be  minimized  to  an  acceptable  degree  if  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  the  support  program26   for  the  reserve  are  implemented \neffectively in compliance with loan covenants. \n\nto  mitigate  such \n\n35. \nThe  Hulunbeier  grasslands  and  the  reserve  are  considered  critical  habitat  under  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. In line with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement for \nprojects  in  critical  habitats  and  protected  areas,  specialist  studies  were  carried  out  to \ndemonstrate  that  there  will  be  no  measurable  adverse  impacts  on  critical  habitats  and  to \ndevelop  a  support  program  for  the  reserve.  The  program  includes  three  subcomponents: \n(i) managing  and  raising  the  awareness  of  road  users,  (ii)  ecological  management  and \nmonitoring, and (iii) eco-cultural tourism demonstration. The program is intended to promote and \nenhance the conservation aims of the protected area, offset induced impacts of the project, and \nachieve  a  net  gain  for  biodiversity.  The  project  area  is  in  a  permafrost  zone,  so  the  risks  of \npermafrost  degradation  and  considerations  for  road  design  and  maintenance  have  been \nassessed.  Current  climate  change  projections  indicate  that  permafrost  in  the  project  area  is \nunlikely to degrade until the end of the century. \n\n36. \nInvoluntary resettlement. Seven project roads will result in permanent land acquisition \nof  15,680  mu  and  will  partially  affect  792  people.27 Almost  93%  of  the  land  to  be  acquired  is \ngrassland,  most  of  which  is  already  degraded  and  its  acquisition  will  have  little  impact  on  the \nlivelihood of the affected people. The project will also result in demolition of two unused houses \n(175 square meters) affecting seven people, and part of a disused cement factory affecting 98 \npeople.  The  affected  people  will  be  compensated  for  their  losses.  Four  resettlement  plans \nprepared by the Hulunbeier Bureau of Transport in accordance with Safeguard Policy Statement \nadequately address the land acquisition and resettlement impacts and are based on substantive \nconsultation  with  affected  people. The IMDT  has  assured that  it  will  implement  the  involuntary \nresettlement  safeguard  measures  set  out  in  the  resettlement  plans,  including  providing \nbudgetary resources. The resettlement plans have been disclosed to the affected people and on \nthe  ADB  website.  The  IMDT  has  relevant  experience  in  implementing  social  safeguards,  and \nadditional  capacity  development support for  social  safeguards  implementation  is  also  included \nin the project.  \n\n37. \nIndigenous  peoples. Within  the  project-affected  area,  Mongolians  are the main  ethnic \nminority community, mainly living in rural areas. Village and household surveys indicate that the \nethnic  minority  community  supports  the  project.  Improved  rural  roads  will  be  particularly \nbeneficial  for  the  ethnic  minority  community,  ensuring  better  access  to  social  services  and \nnonfarm  employment  opportunities,  higher  profitability  from  livestock  and  farm  products,  and \nimproved  disaster  rescue  and  relief  delivery.  The  community  will  also  benefit  from  preferential \ntreatment  for  project-generated  employment  opportunities.  Potential  negative  impacts  include \nconstruction-related  disturbances  and  road  safety,  and  concerns  about  impacts  on  ethnic \nculture and customs. To avoid and mitigate these impacts, an ethnic minority development plan \n                                                 \n26 Community-Based  Tourism and  Environment  Conservation\u2013Detailed  description  of  support  program for  the  Dalai \nLake National Nature Reserve (components under Outputs 4 and 5) (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n\n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nbased  on  substantial  community  consultations  has  been  prepared  and  budgeted.  It  has  been \nendorsed by the Hulunbeier Bureau of Transport and disclosed to the affected communities and \non the ADB website.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe project has no unusual risks and the project\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh costs and risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n\nRisks \nProcurement delays \n\nLimited ability to \nhandle ADB safeguard \nrequirements  \n\nDelays in provision of \ncounterpart funding \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nincludes  consultant  support \n\nMitigating Measures \nPMO  will  hire  an  external  procurement  agency  to  handle  all  bidding.

Clauses on safeguards management will be included \nin  the  civil  works  and  supervision  contracts.  The  executing  agency  will  hire  independent \nmonitors for resettlement and environmental safeguard compliance.  \nThe fiscal situation of the executing agency has been assessed and found to be adequate \nfor  project  financing.  Through  a  loan  assurance,  the  IMAR  government  has  agreed  to \nensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funding.  In  liaison  with  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agency, the PMO will closely monitor the funding requirements of the project \ncomponents.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IMAR = Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PMO = project management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n39. \nThe  government  and  IMDT  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n40. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n\nThe government and IMDT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n41. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Inner  Mongolia  Road  Development \nProject,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                 \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n11 September 2013\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nAssumptions and Risks \nAssumptions \nInner Mongolia\u2019s long-term \ngrowth remains robust \n \nStrong government \ncommitment to provide \naccess to villages, \ntownships, and counties \n \n \n \n\nAssumption \nDemand for resources from \nRussian Federation and \nMongolia continues to rise \nrapidly \n \nRisks \nProjected traffic growth \ndoes not occur because of \nslowdown in economic \ngrowth \n \nRoad safety program may \nnot be implemented \nefficiently \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nEfficient, inclusive, \nand safe movement \nof people and goods \nin IMAR and across \nthe borders of \nRussian Federation \nand Mongolia \n\nOutcome \nSafe and efficient \nroad transport \nnetwork that supports \nenvironmental \nconservation and \nsustainable tourism \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nInner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region \nTransport \nDepartment reports \n \nLocal government \nstatistics, reports \n \n \nIMAR customs data  \n \n \n \n \nImpact evaluation \nassessment \n \n\n \nTraffic survey data \n \n \n \n \n \nCross-border town \ntraffic speed and \ncommuter surveys  \n \n \nAccident statistics \nfrom the provincial \ngovernment \n \nPolice accident \nrecords and statistics \n \nProject progress \nreports \n \n \n \n \nAnnual monitoring \ndata of NNR \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\n \nBy 2020: \n70% of the villages in IMAR \nhave paved road access from \nthe 2010 level of 56%  \n \n100% of townships in IMAR \nhave paved road access from \nthe 2010 level of 73% \n \n20% increase in freight volume \nacross the border at Manzhouli \nfrom the 2009 level of 24.2 \nmillion tons \n \nAccident rate reduced by 20% \nfrom 2009 level of 9.4 fatalities \nper 100,000 people  \n \n \nBy 2018: \nTraffic volume on the highway \n(Manzhouli\u2013Alatanemole) \nincreased by 80% from 2,500 \npcu (baseline) in 2011 \n \nTravel time from Manzhouli to \nAlatanemole reduced by at \nleast 20% from 1 hour and 50 \nminutes in 2011  \n \nAccident rate (fatalities and \nserious injuries) on project \narea roads decreases by at \nleast 20% from 60 incidents \nper year in 2009  \n \n \nBorder-crossing points at \nArihasate and Ebuduge are \nkept open 365 days a year and \nupgraded from class II to class \nI status  \n \nIncreased vegetation \nmonitoring in the Dalai Lake \nNNR by increasing to eight \ntransects and/or plots from \nfour in 2011  \n \n132 km of highways upgraded \nfrom class III to class I and \nconform to at least iRAP 3 star \nrating for road safety \n\n \n\nOutputs  \n1.
