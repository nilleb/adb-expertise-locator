By improving the very poor condition of \nthe country\u2019s most important road, which joins the airport with the seaport of Betio through the \nadministrative  capital  of  Bairiki  and  runs  the  length  of  an  extremely  narrow  and  densely \npopulated area that is home to more than two-fifths of Kiribati\u2019s people, the project will make the \nnation\u2019s  transportation  system  more  efficient  and  add  to  its  overall  quality  of  life.  The  World \nBank  and  the  Pacific  Regional  Infrastructure  Facility  (PRIF)  will  cofinance  the  project  with  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  pressures  of  high  population  growth  underlie  many  of  Kiribati's  development \nchallenges. They are most pronounced in South Tarawa, where 42% of the population lives and \nwhich  attracts migrants with  opportunities for  cash  employment,  diverse consumer goods,  and \naccess  to  essential  social  services.  The  seaport  islet  of  Betio,  for  example,  has  an  estimated \n2,588  people  per  square kilometer  or  half  of the population  density  of Tokyo, Japan. This  has \nput  South  Tarawa\u2019s  land  and  fresh  water  resources,  its  public  health,  education,  water,  and \nelectricity services, and its roads under severe strain.  \n \n4. \nKiribati\u2019s growth potential is constrained by (i) the small land area of its 33 islands which \nare  dispersed  over  3.5  million  square  kilometers  of  ocean;  (ii)  its  remoteness  from  major \nmarkets,  which  makes  its  external  transport  costs  high;  (iii)  its  extreme  vulnerability  to  natural \nforces,  including  climate  change  and  rising  sea  levels;  and  (iv)  the  scarcity  of  its  natural \nresources. Because the public sector accounts for 50% of gross domestic product and provides \naround  two-thirds  of  formal  sector  employment,  government  expenditure  tends  to  drive  the \neconomy. \n \n5. \nThe  development  priorities  set  out  in  the  Kiribati  Development  Plan  2008\u20132011  are \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  along  with  creating  a  sustainable  environment,  and \nbetter  governance  and  infrastructure.  The  plan  aligns  with  ADB's  core  specializations  of \ninfrastructure  and  environment,  including  climate  change,  under  Strategy  2020 1 as  well  as  its \ndrivers  of  change\u2014private  sector  development  and  good  governance  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  The  Kiribati  country  partnership  strategy  2010\u20132014  aims  to  support  the \ngovernment in three key plan areas\u2014economic growth and poverty reduction, the environment, \nand  infrastructure. 2 Poverty  reduction  is  to  be  achieved  by  promoting  economic  opportunities \nthrough  more  efficient  public  financial  management  and  creating  more  and  better  access  and \ndelivery of sustainable infrastructure services. \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n2  ADB. 2010. Country Partnership Strategy; Kiribati, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n\n\fThe transport, power, water supply, and sanitation infrastructure necessary for economic \n6. \ndevelopment is generally in bad condition in Kiribati and poorly managed. Good infrastructure is \nneeded in the population and potential economic growth centers to upgrade services and lower \nthe economy\u2019s cost structure. Many of these services are delivered inefficiently and incur high \ncosts but are provided to users at below-cost prices. Substandard infrastructure raises business \ncosts and contributes to poverty by restricting job creation. The lack of basic public services is a \nmain cause of hardship and poor health outcomes in Kiribati. When services are inadequate or \ninaccessible,  willingness  to  pay  is  undermined  and  service  provision  spirals  downward.  The \ngovernment is limited in its ability to increase public investment. \n \n7. \nThe country\u2019s small network of main and minor roads is about 800 km long, of which 133 \nkm are sealed. South Tarawa has 41.6 km of sealed roads and Kiritimati 84 km. The remaining \nroads, mostly unsealed, are distributed among the other inhabited islands and atolls. Kiritimati\u2019s \nnetwork is relatively lightly used and in good condition compared with the South Tarawa roads, \nwhose rapid deterioration under heavy traffic has national economic and social significance.  \n \nProlonged wet weather and ever heavier traffic volumes have accelerated road damage \n8. \non South Tarawa in the past year and, while parts of the network were rehabilitated in 2008, the \nremaining sections of paved roads have reached the end of their economic life. This profoundly \naffects the lives of the entire population, virtually all of whom live close to and depend in many \nways  on  the  main  road.  Average  travel  speed  is  reduced  to  20  km  per  hour  and  vehicles  are \nforced  to  navigate  large,  deep  depressions  that  fill  with  water  during  the  rainy  season.  Taxi \noperators  have  reportedly  stopped  services  to  avoid  further  damage  to  vehicles.  In  the  dry \nseason,  dust  along  unpaved  sections  causes  upper  respiratory  tract  problems.  Large  pools  of \nstagnant  water  present  another  public  health  risk  as  breeding  grounds  for  mosquitoes.  South \nTarawa  residents  cannot  escape  these  problems.  The  atoll  is  generally  no  more  than  100 \nmeters  wide  and  almost  all  of  them  live,  work,  or  study  in  dwellings,  small  businesses,  and \nschools that line either side of almost its entire length.  \n \n9. \nRoad use in South Tarawa has grown 4% annually in recent years, with 6,000 vehicles \nnow  travelling  the  busiest  roads  in  Betio  and  Bairiki  each  day,  40%  of  them  privately  owned \nminibuses  that  provide  public  transportation. The  government  hires these  minibuses  and  uses \nits  own  buses  to  transport  government  personnel  to  and  from  work  at  a  cost  of  about  A$1.5 \nmillion  per  annum.  The  few  heavy  vehicles,  including  fuel  tankers  and  container  transports, \ncontribute  significantly  to  erosion  of  the  road  edges  but  the  pavement  is  generally  strong \nenough because the underlying coral gravel is solid.  \n \n10. \nthe \ndeterioration of South Tarawa\u2019s road network. The police department is responsible for vehicle \ninspections although regulations are outdated, as well as for licensing drivers and safety. Town \ncouncils collect annual vehicle licensing fees and set fares for public transport but the fees are \nvery  low  and  the  councils  are  responsible  only  for  maintaining  feeder  roads.  Little  or  no \nmaintenance is performed on either the main or feeder roads. The Ministry of Public Works and \nUtilities  (MPWU)  is  supposed  to  maintain  the  main  roads  but  receives  an  overall  annual \nmaintenance  appropriation  that  includes  other  activities  and  is  insufficient.  Maintenance  is \ninadequate and reactive.  \n \nA lack of routine drainage maintenance and a failure to make timely pothole repairs have \n11. \nallowed  formerly  paved  sections  of  the  road  to  be  reduced  to  a  gravel  surface.  No  periodic \nmaintenance or resealing has been done. The roads, moreover, are more than 20 years old and \nwould be overdue for rehabilitation even after proper care.  \n\nineffective  governance  arrangements  have  contributed \n\nFragmented  and \n\nto \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \n12. \nTo ensure proper maintenance in the future, the project can make use of an opportunity \nto  rationalize  the  management  and  financing  of  the  road  sector  in  South  Tarawa.  The  road \nnetwork is small but vehicle traffic is heavy and the tolls collected yearly on the system\u2019s Betio \nCauseway  exceed  what  is  needed  to  fund  annual  maintenance  of  all  of  the  atoll\u2019s  roads.  The \ncauseway  maintenance  fund  has  a  balance  of  A$2.5  million  from  accumulated  toll  revenue. \nFurther  maintenance  funding  could  be  made  available  by  raising  fuel  taxes  and  annual \nregistration fees, both of which are low. \n \n13. \nThrough  capacity  building  and  institutional  reform,  the  project  will  ensure  that \nmaintenance  is  adequately  performed  and  financed  and  that  the  rehabilitated  roads  remain \nserviceable for at least 20 years. \n \n14. \nThe project has been jointly prepared by ADB and World Bank staff in coordination with \nthe New Zealand Aid Programme, which has current projects for infrastructure development and \ncapacity building in South Tarawa. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe project\u2019s impact will be an improvement in socioeconomic conditions for the people \nof South Tarawa. The outcome will be their access to a safe, sustainable, well-maintained road \nnetwork.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  rehabilitation  or  upgrading  of  the  road  network  in  South \nTarawa, and (iii) trained and equipped community-based enterprises for road maintenance.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nOutput  1. The South Tarawa road network will be rehabilitated and upgraded. The civil \nworks  will  be  procured  under  a  single  civil  works  contract  and  will  comprise  the  following \ninvestment components:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRehabilitation of paved roads. The road from St. Anne to the airport (21.5 km), \nincluding  the  Temaiku  spur  (about  2.8  km),  will  be  rehabilitated.  Rehabilitation \nand  upgrading  will  include  reconstruction  and  strengthening  of  the  pavement, \ndrainage  improvements,  and  provision  of  such  safety  features  as  speed  humps \nand footpaths. \nRepairs  to  paved  roads  in  Betio  and  Bikenibeu. In 2008, the Government of \nJapan  financed  the  reconstruction  of  the  paved  road  network  in  Betio.  Since \nthen,  localized  pavement  failures  have  occurred,  mainly  due  to  inadequate \ndrainage. These will be repaired under the project and additional drainage will be \nbuilt.  \nSealing  of  feeder  roads.  About  6  km  of  priority  unsealed  urban  feeder  roads \nwith high traffic volumes will be upgraded and sealed.  \nRehabilitation  of  Betio  Causeway. The pavement on the causeway (about 3.2 \nkm) will be rehabilitated and the bridge deck will be repaired. \n\n \n17. \nOutput 2. The project will establish community-based road maintenance groups with the \ncapacity to maintain the road network. The civil works contractor will employ and train persons \nselected  by  the  MPWU,  which  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  in  consultation  with  the \ncontractor,  community  groups,  town  councils,  and  relevant  stakeholders.  Technical  assistance \n(TA)  will  prepare  and  deliver  training  programs  not  provided  by  the  contractor,  including \naccounting  and  business  management  (para.  25).  The  training  in  maintenance  practices \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nprovided by the contractor will be hands-on and monitored by the contract supervising engineer \nto ensure that it is effective. The civil works contract will include a 2-year defects liability period \nduring which routine maintenance will remain the responsibility of the civil works contractor but \nwill  be  undertaken  by  the  community-based  maintenance  groups,  which  the  contractor  will \nengage  under  a  performance-based  contract.  The  MPWU  will  assume  responsibility  for \nmaintenance when the defects liability period expires but will also engage the community-based \nmaintenance  groups  for  this  work  under  performance-based  contracts.  Major  periodic \nmaintenance  or  repair  of  storm  damage  will  not  be  covered  by  these  contracts  and  will  be \nundertaken by MPWU. \n \nD. \n \n18. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $33.66 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

Interest during construction will be capitalized. \n \n20. \nIn addition to ADB financing of the equivalent of $12 million, the Government of Kiribati \nwill provide $1.05 million to be drawn from user tolls on the Betio Causeway. The Government \nof  Australia  is  expected  to  provide  $3.75  million  toward  the  cost  of  the  civil  works  on  a  grant \nbasis  through  the  PRIF.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  loan  of  $16.0  million  from  the \nInternational Development Association resources of the World Bank.

ADB  and  the  World  Bank  are  setting  up \narrangements to cooperate and coordinate their efforts for joint financing and implementation of \nthe  project  in  consultation  with  the  government.  For  this  purpose,  ADB  is  developing,  in \nconsultation  with  the  World  Bank,  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  lay  out  the  basic \nprinciples  and  procedural  aspects  of  collaboration  during  the  implementation  of  the  project.  In \nview of the limited number of global suppliers likely to be interested in a geographically isolated \nproject  of  this  size,  it  is  not  feasible  or  desirable  to  split  the  works  into  separate  physical \ncomponents or contracts with different suppliers. It is therefore more efficient and economical to \nprocure  the  civil  works  under  a  single  contract  that  will  be  cofinanced  jointly  with  the  World \nBank, PRIF, and the government. To enable joint cofinancing of this procurement package, ADB \nBoard  of  Directors\u2019  waiver  of  member  country  procurement  eligibility  restrictions  is  sought  to \npermit  participation  of  bidders  from  non-ADB  member  countries  and/or  procurement  of  goods \nand  services  from  non-ADB  member  countries.  In  addition,  considering  the  joint  nature  of  the \nfinancing and significant fiduciary and reputation risks involved, firms and entities sanctioned by \neither of ADB or the World Bank will be debarred from participating in contracts which are jointly \nfinanced. \n \n24. \nConsulting services. A firm of consultants will be recruited for design and construction \nsupervision. Because recruitment delays can delay project implementation and the MPWU lacks \ncapacity for this  activity,  ADB  will,  at  the government\u2019s  request, select  the firm to  expedite  the \nprocess. 6 The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), the executing agency, \nwill enter into a contract with the selected firm. \n                                                \n5  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Due to lack of capacity for undertaking consultant recruitment, the MFED asked ADB to undertake selection on its \nbehalf. Advance action on consultant recruitment will reduce the implementation period by an estimated 6 months. \nConsultants will be fielded by 6 January 2011. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n25. \nAssociated  Pacific  Regional  Infrastructure  Facility-financed  technical  assistance. \nUnder an associated TA financed by the PRIF and managed by the World Bank, the project will \nhelp  the  government  develop  better  institutional  arrangements  for  managing  Kiribati\u2019s  road \nassets,  making  the  land  transport  sector  more  efficient,  and  using  funds  effectively.    It  will \nsupport a review of the existing arrangements in the sector and the design and implementation \nof a road map for restructuring. This process will include (i) identifying the options for reforming \nthe related ministries; (ii) identifying options for recovering and allocating the cost of maintaining \nroads, including the use of revenues from vehicle import duties, fuel taxes, and registration fees; \nand (iii) preparing associated legislation. A second component will support a road safety action \nplan  and  the  reinvigoration  of  an  existing  but  nonfunctional  Road  Safety  Committee. \nMicroenterprise  road  maintenance  groups  will  be  established  and  trained  under  a  third  TA \ncomponent. The terms of reference for consultants under the PRIF-financed TA are appended. 7 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nLoan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \n1 January 2011\u201330 October 2013 \n30 April 2013 \n30 October 2013 \n\nSteering Committee \nSecretary for public works and utilities (chair)  \nSecretary for finance and economic development (member) \nSecretary for transport and communications (member) \nSecretary  for  environment,  land,  and  agriculture  development \n(member) \nRepresentative  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  providing  a  link \nwith  the  Sustainable  Towns  Project  financed  by  the  New  Zealand \nAid  Programme  and  the  Kiribati  Association  of  Non-Governmental \nOrganizations (member) \nCommissioner of police \nTelecom Services Kiribati Ltd \nMinistry of Finance and Economic Development \nMinistry of Public Works and Utilities \n\nMinistry of Public Works and Utilities, 4 staff  \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection \n\n1 contract \n\n71 person-months (66 \ninternational and 5 \nnational) \n\n$25.28 million \n\n$2.23 million \n\nThe contract for design and supervision services will be eligible for \nretroactive financing up to $600,000 (the equivalent of 5% of the \ntotal ADB loan) incurred before loan effectiveness but not more \nthan 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB.  \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagency \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSources: Government of Kiribati, ADB, and World Bank assessments. \n\n                                                \n7 Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nDesign and construction. Project design and construction pose no significant technical \n26. \nissues. Project preparation included a comprehensive road safety audit of all of South Tarawa\u2019s \nroads  and  the  recommendations  that  emerged  will  form  the  basis  of  the  detailed  engineering \ndesigns. 8 The  key  challenge  will  be  a  scarcity  of  local  material  for  road  construction.  Beach \nmining of local coral gravel is unacceptable because of potential environmental damage through \ncoastal  erosion.  The  project  will  import  aggregates  instead.  The  most  likely  source  is  Nauru \nwhere the restoration of areas that have been mined for phosphates is to be financed in part by \ncrushing and exporting limestone pinnacles left behind in the extraction process. This material \noffers an added advantage, in that it is better for this rehabilitation work than coral. Because the \nrapid pavement deterioration on the road has resulted mainly from poor drainage, the drainage \ncomponent of the project will need to be carefully designed.  \n \nClimate change. The road runs near the edge of the lagoon for most of its length. A rise \n27. \nin  sea  level  and  increased  erosion  represent  the  most  significant  threats  to  its  sustainability. \nCoastal protection work is ongoing under the second phase of the World Bank-financed Kiribati \nAdaptation  Project  9 and  a  third  phase  is  planned.  The  drainage  design  will  take  into  account \nthe  possible  risk  posed  by  heavier  rainfall  in  future  years.  Because  some  future  climate \nscenarios  also  forecast  longer  and  more  intense  droughts,  the  project  will  consider  directing \nrunoff to soak pits to increase groundwater. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n28. \nEconomic impact. The economic internal rates of return calculated for the rehabilitation \nof all the project road sections, using the World Bank Highway Development and Management \nModel,  lie  between  24%  and  105%  and  average  45.3%  overall.  10 These  high  rates  of  return \nreflect the heavy traffic of up to 6,000 vehicles per day on the existing road system and its poor \ncurrent condition. Economic internal rates of return for road safety improvements have not been \ncalculated  since  the  specific  safety  activities  will  be  defined  during  project  implementation. \nBased  on  prior  experience,  however, road  safety  improvements generate  a  high  rate  of return \nthat usually exceeds those for rehabilitation.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nFinancial governance. Kiribati\u2019s procurement practices have no systematic mechanism \nfor  collecting  data  on  the  use  of  open  competition,  make  no  public  disclosure  of  contracts \nawarded, and lack procurement regulations. The use of expenditure commitment controls varies \nbetween  ministries  but  is  generally  insufficient.  Although  financial  laws  and  regulations  have \nbeen  updated  periodically  since  their  original  enactment  in  the  mid-1970s,  they  do  not  reflect \ncurrent  business  practices  or  modern  public  financial  management.  Understanding  and \ncompliance with existing regulations is also weak. Internal audit is weak, does not have its own \nmandate, and is not actively involved in systems monitoring. \n\n                                                \n8  World Bank. 2010. Report of the Road Safety Audit on Tarawa, Republic of Kiribati. Sydney. \n9  Phases 1 and 2 of the Kiribati Adaptation Project have been implemented by World Bank and supported by World \nBank,  the  Global  Environmental  Facility,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  New \nZealand  Aid  Programme,  the  Japan  PHRD  Climate  Change  Fund,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP). A parallel project by the European Union also involves coastal protection work. \n\n10 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n30. \nA  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  conducted  in  Kiribati  in \nearly  2010  identified  weaknesses  in  budget  accuracy,  significant  delays  and  quality  issues  in \nrecording  and  reporting  financial  information,  and  deficiencies  in  internal  controls  and  audit. \nBased  on  this  assessment,  the  project  will  use  only  direct  disbursement  procedures  and  an \nexternal  auditor  will  be  engaged  for  the  annual  audit  of  project  accounts.  The  single \nprocurement by international competitive bidding for the civil works contract will be managed by \nthe design and supervision consultants, with close oversight from ADB and the World Bank. \n \n31. \nADB has explained and discussed its Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwith  the  government,  the  MFED,  and  the  MPWU.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (Appendix 2). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nThe project will directly benefit the entire population of South Tarawa for whom the road \nis  a  vital  shared  communal  asset.  As  the  lone  vehicular  transport  route  on  the  atoll,  the  road \nprovides  access  to  the  airport,  the  port,  local  wharves,  markets,  churches,  nongovernment \norganizations,  businesses,  and  government,  education,  and  health  services.  It  sustains \neconomic development, links communities, and is also the main thoroughfare for pedestrians. \n \nPrivate car owners, bus and truck operators, freight handlers, retailers and wholesalers, \n33. \nutility  providers,  public \ntransport  users,  motorcyclists,  cyclists,  pedestrians,  residents, \nbusinesses, and the government will all benefit directly from the project. It will reduce roadside \ndust,  thereby  improving  air  quality,  leaving  homes,  shops,  and  vehicles  cleaner,  and  reducing \ndamage to equipment. It will make bus travel more convenient and pleasant and provide safer \nbus stops and bus shelters that protect travellers from sun and rain. New footpaths will improve \npedestrian safety and cut back reliance and spending on vehicle transport. The project design \nwill minimize damage to roadside trees, which provide shade and shelter from sun and rain. \n \n34. \nThe port area of Betio, which the project road serves, is the site of a prostitution industry \nthat  presents  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission.  While  the  current  HIV/AIDS  rate  in  South \nTarawa is reported to be low, the port is a hub for international fishing vessels and an estimated \n30%  of the  sexually  active  population  has  a  sexually  transmitted  infection.  There  is  a risk that \ninfection  rates  will  increase.  The  project  will  conduct  an  HIV/AIDS  information  and  education \ncampaign  for  the  contractor\u2019s  employees,  subcontractors,  consultants,  and  communities  near \nthe  project  site.  The  Kiribati  Country  Coordinating  Mechanism  has  been  established  by  the \ngovernment  to  coordinate  HIV/AIDS  activities  including  voluntary  counseling  and  testing \nfacilities.  The  civil  works  contract  will  contain  a  provisional  sum  to  cover  the  cost  of  the \ninformation  and  education  campaign.  The  Kiribati  Country  Coordinating  Mechanism  will  work \nwith  the  contractor  to  identify  an  appropriate  nongovernment  organization  to  deliver  the \ninformation and education campaign. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  preparing  the  project,  due  diligence  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n35. \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  and  an  initial  environmental \n36. \nexamination has been prepared. 11 The main potential impacts include (i) disturbance from dust \narising  from  loading,  unloading,  and  transportation  of  construction  materials;  (ii)  noise;  (iii) \nerosion  and  sedimentation  from  exposed  surfaces  during  construction  that  may  affect  the \nlagoon environment; (iv) risks from the use and disposal of hazardous materials such as used \nfuel  and  lubricants;  and  (v)  increased  risk  of  accidents  from  increased  vehicle  movements. \nDetailed  mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project,  as  outlined  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  A  national  environmental  specialist  to  be  engaged  for  4.5 \nperson-months will monitor the implementation of this plan during the 18 months of construction.   \n \n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is classified as category B. No buildings are to be \nrelocated and no economic crops affected. To the extent possible, the rehabilitated roads will be \ndesigned  for  construction  on  the  current  road  alignment.  New  bus  bays  and  drainage \neasements will be outside of this area but people who may be affected will be consulted during \nthe  design  to  determine  where  best  to  locate  these  facilities  to  minimize  resettlement.  Any \nresettlement  that  may  be  required  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nplan. 12 The World Bank will finance the cost of the related TA for updating land and economic \ncrop  valuation.  Few  areas  are  expected  to  require  land  acquisition  for  resettlement.  If \nacquisitions prove necessary, the Ministry of Environment, Land and Agriculture Development, \nwhose surveyors will be supported by those of the design and construction supervision teams, \nhas been assessed to have adequate capacity to implement the resettlement plan.  \n \n38. \nIndigenous  persons.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C.  The  people  of  South \nTarawa  are from  a  single  ethnic group. There  are  no  customary,  cultural,  economic,  social,  or \npolitical institutions that set South Tarawa apart from the rest of Kiribati society. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 13  The  risks  can  be  managed  and  are \nmitigated  by  the  design  of  the  project.  The  intended  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nIncreased prices for fuel and raw materials lead to \ncost overruns. \n\nThe  government  provides  insufficient  funding  for \nroad maintenance. \n\nMitigating Measures \nCost  overruns,  particularly  at  civil  works  bidding \nstage,  will  be  mitigated  by  reducing  the  project \nscope prior to awarding the contract.  \nThe  civil  works  contractor  will  be  responsible  for \nmaintenance  for  an  extended  defects  liability \nthat  any  poor \nperiod  of  2  years,  ensuring \nconstruction exposed by a second wet season is \nrepaired. \nTechnical  assistance  will  help  the  government \nestablish  a  dedicated  road \nfrom  user \ncharges  and  will  train  community-based  road \nmaintenance groups. \nA  single  design  and  supervision  consultant  will \nthe \nprovide  support \n\nthe  MPWU  and \n\nfund \n\nto \n\nThe  Government  of  Kiribati  lacks  capacity  to \nimplement  the  project,  including  the  preparation \n\n                                                \n11 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n12 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nof quality and timely financial reports to ADB. \n\nMitigating Measures \ngovernment in implementing the project, including \nprocuring the civil works contractor. \nDirect  payment  methodology  will  be  used  for \ndisbursements. \nThe project will provide training to key staff in the \nMPWU and the MFED. \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  will  conduct  regular \nreview missions. \nAn  external  auditor  will  be  hired  to  conduct  the \nannual audit of the project. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFED = Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, MPWU = \nMinistry of Public Works and Utilities. \nSources: ADB and World Bank assessments. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  the  MFED  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\n40. \nThe  government  and  the  MFED  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and the loan agreement. \n \n41. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n42. \nSubject  to  compliance  with  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement,  the  loan  shall  become  effective  only  if funding from  the World  Bank  and  the  PRIF \nhas been secured.
