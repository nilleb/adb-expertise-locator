It\nhas  approximately  22  million  people,  which  includes  11  indigenous\nethnic minority groups. The proposed project area consists of 10 upland\ndistricts among four provinces within the north central coast and central\nhighlands subregions.  The four selected provinces are all poor, with a\nper  capita  expenditure  that  is  68  percent  of  the  national  average.\nSeventy eight percent of the provinces\u2019 2.8 million people are rural. The\nProject  will  be  the  first  major  externally  supported  integrated\nsocioeconomic development initiative in the area, and will establish a\nsound social capital foundation on which to undertake project activities.\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  upgrade  the  socioeconomic\ninfrastructure  and  to  increase  employment  and  income  generating\nopportunities for the rural population and is fully in accord with the\npoverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and\nthe 2001-2005 country strategy\u2019s focus on the central region of Viet\nNam.  The Project is also in accord with the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s\npoverty reduction program for rural populations in the mountainous,\nremote  border  areas  (known  as  \u201cProgram  135\u201d)  and  shares  its\nobjectives of decentralizing decision making and increasing capacity of\ncommunities in those areas.\nClassification Primary: Core Poverty Intervention\nThematic: Governance\nEnvironment Category B\n   Assessment An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  and  the\nsummary IEE was circulated to the Board on 7 June 2001.\nRationale Remote upland populations are poor in many countries.  In Viet Nam,\nproblems common to remote uplands everywhere are exacerbated by\ncultural  and  language  differences  between  the  majority  Kinh  and\nindigenous populations.  Over the past 40 years, war, firebombing,\nagent orange, cholera, floods, loss of self-rule, education in a nonnative\nlanguage,  and  forced  settlement  have  left  much  of  the  indigenous\npopulation, who make up 60 percent of the population in the project\narea, suffering from a sense of powerlessness.  The vast majority of the\npopulation  relies  primarily  on  subsistence  agriculture.  Marketable\nsurpluses are minimal. Over half the population experience seasonal\nfood insecurity, and more than half the children suffer varying degrees\nof  malnutrition.  The  weak  institutional  support  system  is  unable  to\naddress the needs of the rural poor and the indigenous population. The\n10  districts  selected  for  project  implementation  are  all  among  the\npoorest 150 districts out of a total of 490 in Viet Nam.", "iii\nObjectives and Scope The objective of the Project is to help the Government ensure that the\npoor in upland communes of Kon Tum, Quang Binh, Quang Tri and\nThua  Thien  Hue  achieve  sustainable  livelihoods  with  an  improving\nquality of life resulting in a reduction in the incidence of poverty in the\nproject area. A critical feature of the proposed Project is its focus on\ndeveloping innovative natural resource management strategies linked\nto social development objectives. These objectives will be achieved\nthrough  (i)  improving  and  sustaining  household  food  security;  (ii)\ngenerating of incremental household income through improved on-farm\nproductivity,  infrastructure  development,  and  off-farm  income\ngenerating opportunities;  (iii) developing community capacity to utilize\nand manage scarce resources to achieve equitable and sustainable\nsocioeconomic development through planning and implementation of\nan expanded social development plan; (iv) strengthening the capacity of\nsupport services to respond to grassroots initiatives so that they can\ndeliver  improved  services  in  upland  communities;  and  (v)  providing\ntechnical and financial support for the efficient implementation of the\nProject.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $76.0 million equivalent,\ninclusive of physical and price contingencies, taxes, and duties.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Livelihood Improvement\nProject, and (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant for\nthe Project to be provided by the Government of the United Kingdom.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The proposed Central Region Livelihood Improvement Project (the Project) is included in\nthe 2001 Country Assistance Plan of the ADB for Viet Nam. In response to a request from the\nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  a  targeted\nintervention  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  central  region  of  Viet  Nam.1  Early\ndiscussions with the Government resulted in agreement that the Project would focus on 10\nupland districts in four central region provinces.2 The design of the proposed Project was based\non  the  results  of  qualitative  and  quantitative  surveys  carried  out  in  four  representative\ncommunes  during  the  TA.  The  TA  also  undertook  targeted  socioeconomic  surveys  and\nparticipatory  rural  appraisal  (PRA)  exercises  combined  with  group  meetings  and  intensive\nconsultation  with  stakeholders,  including  the  Government,  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs), and other funding agencies. These were used to review the needs of beneficiaries, and\ntheir socioeconomic conditions and survival strategies. A series of planning workshops were\nconvened in the central region and Hanoi to develop the project framework and discuss the\nproject  design  with  government  representatives,  external  funding  agencies,  and  other\nstakeholders. An ADB mission carried out loan appraisal from 22 May to 8 June 2001.3 The\nproject framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Description of the Project Area\n3. The central region of Viet Nam consists of 18 provinces distributed among three sub-\nregions\u2014north central coast, south central coast and central highlands. The least developed\nregion of Viet Nam, the central region has approximately 22 million people, representing nearly\n28 percent of the country\u2019s total population, and has been identified by several studies4 as one\nof the poorest of the country. The population comprises 11 indigenous groups belonging to\nthree linguistic families, the Kinh, Malayo-Polynesian, and Mon-Khmer. Until very recently the\nindigenous inhabitants of the uplands were mainly ethnic minority groups.\n4. In the upland regions, natural capital (the natural resource base exploitable for livelihood\ndevelopment)  is  poor  and  fertile  agricultural  land  is  limited.  Populations  were  traditionally\nscattered  and  survived  on  subsistence  slash-and-burn  agriculture.  There  has  been  little\n                  \n1  TA 3392-VIE: Central Region Poverty Reduction Project, for $824,000, approved on 18 January 2000.\n2  The four provinces are Kon Tum, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien-Hue.\n3  The Mission comprised Donneth A.

Attacking Poverty, Hanoi, 1999.", "2\nopportunity to accumulate financial capital. High in-migration since 1975 and improved health\ncare have doubled the population. Much of the indigenous population has been resettled in\nvillages, which have been designed to encourage extensive rice production. Local indigenous\nskills in agriculture are becoming irrelevant. Traditionally, education was informal and literacy\nskills poor (human capital). Infrastructure is less developed than in other areas, because due to\nthe climate and terrain, it is more expensive to construct and harder to maintain (physical\ncapital). Indigenous peoples rarely speak Vietnamese well, if at all, and this puts them at a\ndisadvantage when competing with Kinh in-migrants or when dealing with local services, which\nare delivered in Vietnamese (social capital). This poor asset base, combined with the effects of\nwar, cholera, malaria, and resettlement, contributes to the high incidence of poverty. Although\nabsolute poverty has decreased in upland areas in the last decade, the reduction has been less\nsignificant  than  in  other  parts  of  Viet  Nam.  Upland  areas,  and  in  particular  indigenous\npopulations, represent the poorest of the poor in the selected provinces and are most in need of\nsupport.\n5. The proposed project area consists of 10 upland districts in four provinces in the north\ncentral coast and central highlands subregions. The four selected provinces are all poor, with a\nper capita expenditure that is 68 percent of the national average and below the national average\nin all the provinces. Seventy eight percent of the 2.8 million people are rural. The 10 districts\nmake up about 4 percent of Viet Nam\u2019s total area, and support some 400,000 people, about 0.5\npercent of the national population. The target districts are landlocked and border the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic and Cambodia. On average, 22 percent of the population are in-\nmigrants.  The  population  density  averages  39  people  per  square  kilometer  (km).  This\nunderstates the scattered nature of local populations because the majority of the Kinh migrants\nlive  near  the  district  centers  where  the  limited  irrigated  rice  land  is  situated.  The  ratio  of\nindigenous peoples to Kinh population varies from 51:49 in Kon Tum, to 3:97 in Quang Binh,\n9:91 in Quang Tri, and 4:96 in Thua Thien-Hue.\n2.  Rural Livelihood and Poverty in the Upland Districts\n6. Viet Nam is primarily a rural society with 70 percent of the population living in rural\nareas.  Agriculture  dominates  the  rural  economy.  It  contributes  about  24  percent  of  gross\ndomestic product5 and provides about 70 percent of all employment. Crop production accounts\nfor 70 percent of agricultural output, with livestock accounting for 14 percent, fisheries 10\npercent, and forestry 6 percent. Starting in 1990, agricultural production grew at more than 20\npercent per annum, but has slowed to about 5 percent per annum since 1995. The continued\ngrowth  reflects  the  adoption  of  improved  varieties,  better  fertilizer  use,  and  the  further\ndevelopment of minor irrigation practices. Forests and fisheries are all intensively exploited.\nOther rural economic activities include agro-processing, small cottage industries, construction,\nand service enterprises.\n7. The basic socioeconomic indicators for the selected upland districts reveal a region that\nsuffers  from  both  income  and  human  poverty  (Appendix  2),  especially  among  the  rural\npopulation.  Per  capita  expenditure  is  about  48  percent  lower  than  the  national  average,\napproximately 60 percent of households are below the food poverty line, and up to 75 percent\nare below the general poverty line.6 Many households have no livestock (including poultry), and\nhave insufficient clothes and blankets for the winter. Water supplies are of variable quality, are\ngenerally scarce, and people lack knowledge about safe water. Contaminated water is a major\n                  \n5  TA 3223-VIE: Agriculture Sector Program, Inception Report.\n6  The General Statistical Office/World Bank food poverty line is equivalent to 2,100 calories per capita per day.", "3\nthreat to health. Sanitation systems are poor and over 90 percent of the households use open\nlatrines or open spaces. The availability of health services is variable. Generally, government\nhospitals and clinics are close to district headquarters, but over 50 percent of the households\nare further than 14 km from these facilities. Traditional doctors and traditional treatment of\ndiseases are common in the remote areas. Communication and transport are generally difficult,\nwith many areas cut off from markets for up to two months a year during the rainy season.\n8. The main occupation of the upland districts\u2019 rural population is agriculture (including\nhorticulture and livestock) on flat and mildly sloping land, and shifting cultivation on hilly land.\nAdditional sources of rural livelihood include services, trade, and general business. There is little\npaid agricultural labor. Over 90 percent of the rural households are involved in agriculture and\nonly a small number of households have a second income. The average size of a household\nplot  of  land  suitable  for  rice  production  is  0.1  hectare  (ha).  A  key  indicator  of  poverty  is\nhousehold food security. Data gathered during the TA indicate that the population experiences\nmoderate to severe food shortages on a seasonal basis, with over 60 percent of households\nhaving  insufficient  quantities  of  food  for  up  to  six  months  per  year.  In  the  12  communes\nsurveyed during the TA, the percentage of children under five years of age suffering from\nmalnutrition ranged from 22 to 60 percent. Local health station statistics indicated that infant\nmortality  ranged  from  55-70  per  thousand,  compared  to  the  national  average  of  36.7  per\nthousand. One of the root causes of poverty is dependence on subsistence production of staple\ncrops. Escape from rural poverty depends on development of cash cropping, livestock, or off-\nfarm income. Development of these alternatives is constrained by asset limitations, including\nland, capital, and skills.\n9. The reasons for the extreme poverty are several. The upland districts, though visually\nattractive, are not economically productive. Only 5 percent of land is suitable for agriculture and\nthe generally poor soils and steep contours require special production skills. Most of this land\nhas already been allocated to individual households. Further land is available, but it is gently\nsloping land in barren areas or areas cleared of forest under State Forestry Enterprise (SFE).\nAccess is difficult for poor households because such lands either require detailed and expensive\nland use surveys prior to allocation or remain under SFE control. In-migration of people has\nexacerbated the pressures on the remaining agricultural land. Much of the hilly land that could\noffer income generation opportunities in social forestry is either under the exclusive control of\nthe SFEs or is subject to forestry regulations that deter private forestry investments. This\nsituation has forced poor upland households to adopt a range of coping strategies to address\nfood insecurity. These include reducing the number of meals or the amount of food consumed,\nsubstituting less nutritious food for consumption, and selling livestock and other assets that are\nthen difficult to replace.\n10. Since reunification in 1975, the lives of the people in all the project areas have changed\ngreatly. Reunification brought the administrative structure of the modern state to areas that had\nbeen locally self-governing for generations. One example is the Sedentarization Program, a\nGovernment initiative that aims to move all indigenous peoples from remote areas to settled\nvillages with road and service access by 2010. Major sedentarization projects have combined\nand moved indigenous groups into areas near to administrative centers and large numbers of\nin-migrants have arrived. In the sedentarized villages, communities with extensive agricultural\nskills have been expected to survive by intensive lowland rice production, often on poor soils.\nThe people affected do not appear to be fully informed and consulted and no compensation is\ngiven for lost livelihoods, housing, and community resources. Sedentarization does not appear\nto be compatible in substance and structure with indigenous peoples\u2019 cultures and institutions\nbecause it assumes that people with extensive agricultural skills and traditions can change to", "4\nintensive agricultural practice without any period of transition, and the assistance provided is\ninsufficient to improve their status because the land allocation process does not provide a\nsufficient resource base for households to develop sustainable agricultural systems. Access to\nforest resources has been curtailed and traditional law and state law has overlaid custom.\nSchooling in Vietnamese, a non-native language among ethnic minorities, has been strongly\nencouraged. In-migrants, who are mainly Kinh, have to adapt to harsh climates and unfamiliar\ndiseases, but they operate within a familiar legal structure and in their own mother tongue.\n3.  Land Use in the Target Districts\n11. The project area is divided into three agro-ecological zones. The Truong Son range runs\nalmost north-south through the project area, is a major watershed for the lower Mekong River,\nand forms the headwaters of all major rivers draining eastwards to the central coast. Access into\nthe range is difficult, which has encouraged a very high level of species diversity and cultural\ndiversity. This diversity, together with the topography and remoteness, presents significant\nchallenges  to  programs  of  infrastructure  and  communication,  including  agriculture  support\nservices. The Truong Son agro-ecological zone has the best forest cover of the three zones;\nhowever, large areas of forest cover have been lost due, primarily, to massive aerial herbicide\napplications primarily from Agent Orange. The Central Plateau is a high plain west of the Truong\nSon range. Access is not as difficult as to the Truong Son, and traditional trade and migration\nroutes exist between the Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic and the project area. Since 1975 there\nhas been continuing large-scale settlement of in-migrant Kinh from the north and central coast\nprovinces. The area east of the Truong Son range is characterized by mountainous topography\nand  unstable  soil,  which  makes  access  difficult.  However,  proximity  to  areas  of  dense\npopulation  has  had  strong  agro-ethnological  influences  on  both  the  land  and  the  people.\nEnvironmental damage from deforestation is most severe in this zone, especially in the project\narea in Thua Thien-Hue province.\n12. The Ho Chi Minh Trail passes through 9 of the 10 selected project districts. From 1963\nto 1975, it was heavily bombed, sprayed with aerial herbicides, and firebombed to destroy forest\ncover  and  prevent  its  regeneration.  Many  indigenous  populations  were  uprooted.  The\nGovernment plans to redevelop the Ho Chi Minh Trail by 2005 into the Truong Son Highway. Its\ncompletion will have an immense impact on all the project districts. New economic opportunities\nwill arise, leading to new waves of in-migration and increasing the pressure on an already fragile\nenvironment.  Indigenous  communities,  which  are  not  prepared  to  cope  with  the  market\neconomy, are likely to come under increased stress.\n13. Although no land use capability studies have been made for the project area, it is\nestimated that only about 5 percent of the land can sustain irrigated agriculture. The vast\nmajority of the land area either requires special attention to sustain cereal production or should\nnot be farmed. These upland areas will be unable to achieve cereal self-sufficiency and will\nlikely remain a food deficit area. Nevertheless, opportunities exist for livestock, horticulture,\nindustrial crops, and fish farming, which could greatly assist with existing populations to reduce\ntheir poverty. Two main farming systems can be identified in the project area: one based on wet\nrice paddy in flat, irrigated, or lowland areas; the second is upland-based with isolated and very\nsmall areas of rice, typical of areas with mountainous topography. The components of these\nfarming systems include permanent and shifting upland annual crop production (rice, maize,\nand cassava); rice production in paddy fields (two crops annually); livestock (poultry, pigs,\ncattle,  buffalo,  and  fish);  perennial  cash  crop  production  (coffee  and  pepper);  agroforestry\n(acacia, cinnamon, fruit, incense trees, and others); gardens (diverse mix of fruit, vegetables,\nand medicinal and culinary herbs); and collection of various items (forest products, fishing, and", "5\nhunting). Despite the resource limitations on expanding basic agriculture, there are considerable\nopportunities for developing horticulture and rearing livestock. Farmers suggested that there is\nfurther scope for expanding fruit tree and vegetable production if basic road communication can\nbe  improved.  Better  use  of  the  available  improved  technology  will  follow  if  the  extension\noutreach systems can be broadened and made more responsive to problems identified at\ngrassroots level. Similarly, livestock production could be expanded. Despite the lack of cereals,\nhomestead-based poultry and small animal enterprises could be developed. Women could run\nmany  small  livestock  enterprises.  Such  activities  have  had  a  major  influence  in  the\nempowerment of women in other areas of the country. Cattle contribute to household labor\navailability because they are used for plowing and reduce labor time in land preparation and are\na traditional store of wealth. In similar areas in the north, cattle have been found to generate\nfairly rapid cash surpluses that are often reinvested in cropping improvement.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n14. Rural Development received high priority within the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s six-point\nplan for improving the quality and effectiveness of socioeconomic development between 1996\nand 2000. The major part of the rural development focus was on increasing production of food,\nmeat  and  industrial  crops.  The  objectives  of  the  current  five-year  plan  (2001-2005)  on\nagriculture and rural development are to (i) improve agricultural productivity, competitiveness\nand quality; (ii) develop a strong agro-industrial and services base; (iii) generate increased\nemployment and alleviate poverty in the rural areas; and (iv) restore forests and protect other\nnatural  resources.  The  Government  has  also  identified  human  resources  development,\nespecially for the mountainous and remote areas, as a priority area.\n15. Within this rural development program, the Government has introduced or refocused\nseveral programs specifically targeting poverty. The first of these was the national program for\nHunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction.  The  program  consists  of  several  components,\nincluding  (i)  resettlement  or  \u201csedentarization\u201d  in  and  around  new  economic  zones,  (ii)\ninfrastructure development, (iii) promotion of agriculture and off-farm production, (iv) income\ngeneration and job-creation, (v) capacity building and training, (vi) special support for ethnic\nminorities, (vii) credit and savings for the poor, and (viii) education and health for the poor.\n16. A more recent initiative, Prime-Ministerial Decision 135 (known both as Program 135\nand the 1,715 Commune7 Program) was issued on 31 July 1998 to initiate a poverty reduction\nprogram targeted at communes in especially difficult circumstances in the mountainous, remote,\nand border areas. Among Program 135\u2019s activities are (i) creating income and employment by\npromoting  agriculture  and  forestry,  including  primary  processing;  (ii)  constructing  and/or\nupgrading  rural  infrastructure  that  supports  production  activities  among  the  resettled\npopulations,  including  transportation,  water  supply,  and  electric  (power)  systems;  and  (iii)\ntraining government employees for these communes in order to build capacity in administration\nand  economic  management  that  can  be  responsive  to  socioeconomic  needs  identified  at\ngrassroots level in their localities. Program 135 is designed to follow a bottom-up approach, with\nactivities taken in response to the identified needs of the local communities. The targeted\ncommunes receive priority capital from the central budget and priority investments from other\nexisting government programs. Program 135 enlists the participation of the Department of\nAgriculture and Rural Development (DARD), Department of Planning and Investment (DPI),\nDepartment of Finance, Department of Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Affairs (DEMMA),\n                  \n7 The commune is the lowest level of government administration, and comprises between 8 to 15 villages. The\ncommune people\u2019s committee  administers Program 135.", "6\nwomen\u2019s  union,  and  farmers\u2019  associations,  and  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  vice\nchairperson responsible for social affairs of the Provincial People\u2019s Committees (PPCs).\n17. In the area of rural and microfinance, the Government recognizes the need for an\ninstitutional response for substantial and sustainable expansion of microfinance for poverty\nreduction. Within the broader framework of strengthening the banking sector, the Government\nhas adopted a reform approach that includes (i) restructuring of state-owned commercial banks\nand joint-stock banks, (ii) strengthening the supervisory and regulatory capacity of State Bank of\nViet Nam (SBV), and (iii) moving toward a market-based approach for mobilizing and allocating\nresources.8  While  the  resulting  improvements  in  financial  intermediation  will  benefit  the\nmicrofinance sector in general, the Government is also considering plans to establish a \u201cpolicy\nbank\u201d  as  a  direct  poverty  reduction  intervention.  In  addition,  with  ADB  assistance  the\nGovernment  is  considering  (i)  developing  a  policy  framework  for  microfinance  to  enhance\noutreach to the poor, (ii) examining existing and potential mechanisms and their linkages for\nefficient  delivery  of  microfinance  and  social  services  to  the  poor,  and  (iii)  establishing\nappropriate financial infrastructure for microfinance.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n18. Since 1990, the Government and external agencies have financed a series of projects\nthat directly target the rural poor in the central region (Appendix 3). Fifteen major projects in this\ncategory are ongoing, with commitments of about $300 million, in addition to several smaller\nprojects and initiatives implemented by NGOs making up another $100 million. The central\nhighlands and the north central coast, which are among the poorest regions of Viet Nam and\nhave 17.2 percent of the national population, have received about 10 percent of the total rural\ndevelopment funding, although it has also benefited from several nationwide projects. The\nmajority of the funding they have received is for physical infrastructure.\n19. There have been no major integrated development projects in the proposed project area.\nExternally  assisted  programs  in  the  upland  areas  of  the  central  region  have  been  limited\nbecause of the difficulties of access and low population densities. Exceptions are the Forest\nProtection and Rural Development, World Bank; ADB\u2019s Forestry Sector Project; and the Gia Lai\nAgroforestry Extension Project supported by New Zealand Official Development Assistance.\nThese projects aim to reduce damage to forests and biodiversity by reducing the poverty of the\nlocal  inhabitants.  Other  poverty-focused  projects  in  the  central  region  have  tended  to\nconcentrate on lowland and coastal areas.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n20. The lending activities of ADB and the World Bank are too recent in Viet Nam for any\noverall review of completed projects to have been carried out. Lessons learned were derived\nfrom discussions with project staff, and officials of funding agencies and from the TA team\u2019s\nexperience. These highlighted (i) the need for institutional strengthening to ensure institutional\ncapacity of the executing agencies and regional/district entities and beneficiary groups; (ii) the\nneed to ensure beneficiary participation as early as possible, in the design and implementation\nof the project, and in operations and maintenance (O&M) after project completion; (iii) a flexible\nproject implementation system based on a process-oriented approach with frequent, focused,\nand proactive supervisory missions in the early stages of project implementation, particularly for\nmulticomponent projects; and (iv) the need for the project management team to be within the\n                  \n8  Proposed for financing under the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility of the International Monetary Fund.", "7\nproject area, and mechanisms for regular contact with beneficiaries (extension activities, focal\nfarms, and training). Situating the project management team in the project area affords it the\nopportunity to better understand beneficiary constraints and aspirations, and to adjust project\ncomponents and implementation arrangements as required.\n21. A country portfolio review and evaluation carried out in 2000 by the International Fund\nfor  Agricultural  Development  highlighted  the  following:  (i)  reaching  the  poorest  districts,\ncommunes, and villages, and the poorest households, women, and ethnic minority groups within\nthese  villages  requires  more  knowledge  and  training  at  many  levels;  (ii)  women  prioritize\nhousehold food security over cash crop production, safe water over water for irrigation, and\nmultiple livelihood strategies over single income generation strategies; (iii) lessons from other\nprojects  in  Viet  Nam  suggest  that  high  interest  rates  for  microfinance  are  not  a  problem,\nprovided savings and credit activities are combined with group ownership and capacity building;\n(iv) targeting poor women in credit programs by itself cannot lead to their empowerment as they\nmay become mere conduits for credit for other family members without conscious efforts to\nweave gender issues into credit training; (v) participatory approaches to planning are indeed\ncrucial, but they can lead to poverty and hunger elimination only if they are used for project\nformulation and planning during implementation, and if done sensitively and rigorously, allowing\nfor the voices of the vulnerable groups to be heard; (vi) participation of the grassroots people\ncan be promoted only through decentralized planning and budgeting from the province to district\nand  commune  levels;  (vii)  top-down  economic  management  has  not  only  reflected  the\nimposition of the lowland people\u2019s thinking onto other cultures, but more seriously, has generally\nbeen ineffective; and (viii) projects should focus on training during the first two years of the\nproject phase. Community-based, integrated, and participatory rural development is a new\nconcept for sectoral staff accustomed to a different approach, and limited capacity exists for\nimplementing multisectoral participatory projects.\n22. Lessons from NGO projects in the upland areas indicate that project design should\nreflect local patterns of social organization, religious beliefs, and resource use of the indigenous\npopulation living in the project area. Developing dialogue through government services without\nconsiderable training in cross-cultural relations can be difficult because district and provincial\ngovernment staff receive no training in understanding the point of view of indigenous peoples.\nThe  NGO  experience  also  highlighted  the  importance  of  training  for  developing\nmicroenterprises. Training schedules and duration should be carefully designed and adjusted to\nthe absorptive capacity of microentrepreneurs. Long-term training programs involving multiple\nshort but frequent training events and refresher training are more effective than a single long-\nterm program.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n23. ADB\u2019s new Viet Nam country strategy has been prepared. The Government and other\nstakeholders  have  agreed  that  ADB  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  vision  of  economic\nmodernization and poverty reduction through a focus on making growth and the structural\ntransition pro-poor and sustainable. This will entail emphasis on rural areas and smaller urban\ncenters, particularly in the central region of Viet Nam, combined with national interventions in\npro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, and good governance. Accordingly,\nADB will increasingly focus on the investment and policy conditions that will promote rural\ndevelopment, agricultural diversification, and off-farm employment in rural areas, with emphasis\non small and medium enterprise development. Continuation of policy reforms in agriculture will\nbe supported to enhance rural standards of living and a vibrant and competitive agriculture\nsector. ADB operations will continue to support the role of the private sector in marketing and", "8\ntrade,  land  tenure  reforms  and  issuance  of  land  titles  in  agriculture  and  forestry,\ncommercialization and reform of state-owned enterprises, and promotion of domestic small-\nscale enterprises. In the area of agricultural and rural finance, ADB\u2019 focus could include rural\nfinance for private agro-industries and microfinance for small and poor farmers, and the related\nlegal and regulatory framework for microfinance.\n24.  Rural poverty reduction will also be pursued through projects targeted at a small number\nof contiguous provinces that face similar constraints and opportunities, and are in the central\nregion of Viet Nam. Similar to the proposed project, other operations will be designed, with\nprobable focus on coastal communes in the central region and separately for central highlands\nprovinces.  These  projects  will  emphasize  addressing  the  link  between  natural  resource\ndepletion and poverty. Such area-based approaches will need to be complemented by the\nappropriate infrastructure investment, planned and implemented in a subregional perspective\nwith sector projects covering several provinces.\n25. ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  considers  microfinance  can  increase  the  physical\ncapital of the poor, while simultaneously building human and social capital. The goal of ADB\u2019s\nmicrofinance strategy9 is to ensure permanent access to institutional financial services for the\nmajority of the poor and the purpose is to support microfinance system that can provide diverse\nservices of high quality. The strategy focuses on (i) creating a policy environment conducive to\nmicrofinance,  (ii)  developing  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable  institutions,  (iv)\nsupporting pro-poor innovations, and (v) supporting social intermediation. Emphasis is placed\non designing projects in close consultation with stakeholders, including potential clients, to\nensure that assistance is client-focused, demand-driven, and appropriately priced and delivered.\nSupport to viable institutions that can set in motion such a process has been emphasized, along\nwith reform of development finance institutions that continue to undermine the microfinance\nsector.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n1.  Sustainability of Investments in Rural Infrastructure\n26. The Project will invest significantly in small-scale infrastructure. A critical issue is the\nsustainability of the benefits derived from investments. Road and bridge tolls are being levied\nand proceeds applied to maintenance in some areas, but not yet in project provinces, although\nsuch measures are being considered in Thua Thien-Hue. The infrastructure constructed will\nimpose a significant increase in annual maintenance costs (varying from 6-12 percent). Existing\nwork programs are unlikely to accommodate this incremental cost beyond the life of the Project.\nGovernment funds need to be supplemented by resource mobilization at the local government\nlevel  and  the  financial  performance  of  the  district  peoples\u2019  committee  (DPCs)  requires\nsubstantial improvement. The Government assured ADB that the requisite financial allocations\nwould be made to DPCs to ensure adequate maintenance. After the initial project investment in\ncivil  works,  subsequent  fund  replenishment  for  infrastructure  will  be  dependent  on  these\nallocations  being  met.  The  beneficiaries  will  be  involved  in  the  selection,  design,  and\nimplementation, and will be responsible for maintaining some of the infrastructure provided. For\nirrigation schemes and water supply projects, much of the maintenance responsibility will be\npassed to user groups, and user fees will be collected to pay for capital items.\n                  \n9  R106-00: Finance For the Poor: Microfinance  Development Strategy, 16 May 2000.", "9\n2.  Social Forestry Opportunities\n27. Social  forestry  opportunities  under  the  proposed  Project  will  be  somewhat  limited\npending a clear forestry sector policy. This includes clarification of land classification, and\ndevelopment of appropriate regulations for allocation of rights to individuals and communities for\nforest exploitation. Because SFEs control large land areas, resolution is also linked to the issue\nof state-owned enterprise reform. Lack of clear information on land classification and land use is\na major constraint. The Project will use geographical information system (GIS) data to clarify\nland use and areas allowing common access, as well as the legal constraints and opportunities,\nand will assist each commune to prepare a natural resource management plan. Although clear\ngains are expected during the life of the Project, such as improved management of common\nland, some opportunities for improved land use that will be identified may not be realized under\nthe existing legislative framework. ADB has been working with the Government to refine and\nimplement a clear forestry policy. ADB's forest sector development strategy in Viet Nam is\nsynchronized with the Government\u2019s own planning framework and ten-year implementation\nhorizon (2001-2010).  The strategy emphasizes a comprehensive and integrated approach that\ncan lead to rationalized and sustainable land and forest use and management by (i) promoting\nsustainable  social  and  commercial  forestry,  (ii)  making  non-environmentally  endangered\nforestland available for more remunerative but sustainable mixed forestry-agriculture farming\nsystems, and (iii) ensuring that critical conservation forests (special-use and protection forests)\nare prioritized and effective protection mechanisms are put in place. At the same time, the\nstrategy has to ensure that forest-dependent smallholders and communities have their basic\nsubsistence and livelihoods needs met, and are enabled to participate in the benefits of land\nand  forest  policy  and  investments  through  increased  security  of  land  and  forest  tenure,\nimproved  income  generating  capacity,  and  sufficient  incentives  to  participate  in  the  forest\nprotection process. The ongoing ADB-financed Forestry Sector Project10 is addressing these\ncore issues, which will carry over and be picked up by the proposed project preparatory TA,\nForests for Livelihood Improvement in the Central Highlands project.11\n3.  Unsustainable Natural Resource Utilization\n28. Natural resource exploitation is approaching (or locally exceeding) limits of sustainability.\nThis problem is exacerbated by several deficiencies in development planning, including: (i)\nsustainability as an objective has not yet been institutionalized; (ii) policy reforms are not being\nfully  implemented;  (iii)  policy  reform  is  focused  on  cures  instead  of  prevention;  and  (iv)\ndevelopment  planning  and  resource  allocation  processes  do  not  foster  sustainability.  The\nProject  will  address  these  issues  through  the  use  of  Sustainable  Agriculture  and  Rural\nDevelopment (SARD)12 methodology for natural resources planning. The natural resources\nmanagement  plan  for  each  commune  will  become  the  basis  for  a  negotiated  policy  on\nenvironmental and social development issues in each commune. Each project management unit\n(PMU) will have an environmental specialist responsible for negotiations and discussion with\nauthorities in DARD and the Department of Science, Technology and Environment and for\nprovision of management information to the PPC. By the end of the second year of the Project,\neach commune is expected to have developed an effective natural resources management\nplan. DPCs will ratify the natural resource management plans, and amalgamate them into the\ndistrict plans for submission to the PPCs. Effective development and implementation of these\nplans will be a contributing factor to further project-financed support to a commune.\n                  \n10 Loan 1515-VIE(SF): Forestry Sector Project, for $33 million, approved on 20 March 1997.\n11 The proposed project preparatory TA is scheduled for approval in December 2001.\n12SARD starts from households and leads to local area development plans, preferably based on watersheds rather\nthan administrative units.", "10\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n29. The problems of remote upland communities are exacerbated by cultural and language\ndifferences.  The  majority  of  the  population  relies  on  subsistence  agriculture,  over  half\nexperience seasonal food insecurity, and more than half the children suffer malnutrition. The\nuplands  incorporate  crucial  watersheds,  damage  to  which  has  exacerbated  flooding  and\nchanging microclimates. Improved access has encouraged further forest clearance and in-\nmigration. Poverty among in-migrant and indigenous populations creates additional pressure on\nresources. Comprehensive social development and natural resource use planning are critically\nlacking. The 10 districts selected for implementation are among the poorest 150 out of 490 in\nViet Nam.13 Land suitable for cereal crops is limited and of poor quality. The Project will be the\nfirst  major  externally  supported  integrated  socioeconomic  development  initiative  in  these\nuplands. It has been designed to upgrade the socioeconomic infrastructure and to increase\nincome-generating opportunities and is fully in accord with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and\nfocus on the central region. The design of the Project has taken into consideration (i) the impact\nof completed and ongoing projects in Viet Nam; (ii) promotion of development that is sustainable\nin terms of the natural environment and the capabilities of the target groups; (iii) the need for\nclear lines of authority, delegation, and coordination between concerned government agencies;\n(iv)  the  importance  of  confidence  building  among  beneficiaries,  particularly  the  indigenous\npopulation and women; and (v) the need for institutional strengthening and changed incentives\nat all levels of local government.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n30. The primary objective of the Project is to help the Government to ensure that the poor in\nupland  communes  of  Kon  Tum,  Quang  Binh,  Quang  Tri,  and  Thua  Thien-Hue  achieve\nsustainable livelihoods with an improving quality of life through a reduction in the incidence of\npoverty in the project area. A critical feature of the proposed Project is its focus on developing\ninnovative natural resource management strategies linked to social development objectives.\nImmediate objectives are to (i) improve household food security in a sustainable manner, (ii)\ngenerate incremental household income for the poor through improved on-farm productivity and\noff-farm income generating opportunities, (iii) develop community capacity to utilize and manage\nscarce resources, (iv) strengthen the capacities of support institutions (government and others)\nto  respond  to  grassroots  initiatives  so  that  they  can  deliver  improved  services  in  upland\ncommunes, and (v) transfer project implementation knowledge to local government staff. The\nProject will incorporate sustainable management practices within a SARD framework due to the\nunique and fragile physical environment. Communities will be assisted to design and implement\ntheir own programs. The participatory process will assist the development of trust between all\nthe  ethnic  groups.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  rural  development\nstrategy and its policy of promoting democracy at the grassroots level.\n31. The project consists of five components: (i) household food security, through measures\nto  upgrade  home  gardens  combined  with  nutrition  training,  as  well  as  improved  poultry\nproduction, delivery of improved water supplies, and seed improvement to augment food supply;\n(ii) income generation, through increased productivity arising from better access to microfinance\nand support services, supported by upgrading and constructing infrastructure to enable market\n                  \n13  Based on Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs poverty indicators, confirmed using indicators from the\nVietnamese Living Standards Survey and the national census.", "11\naccess; (iii) community development, to develop local institutions and planning capacity; (iv)\ninstitutional  strengthening,  by  building  supporting  services  to  enable  them  to  respond  to\ngrassroots and community initiatives; and (v) project management, with supporting consulting\ntechnical and advisory services.\n32. The project area includes 10 districts: Dak Glei, Dak To, Kon Plong, and Ngoc Hoi, in\nKon Tum Province; Minh Hoa and Tuyen Hoa in Quang Binh Province; Huong Hoa and Dak\nRong in Quang Tri Province; A Luoi and Nam Dong in Thua Thien-Hue Province. The target\nbeneficiaries will be about 348,000 people living in 65,000 households in 139 communes in the\n10 target districts. Some targeted communes are within and adjacent to existing and proposed\nprotected areas.\n1.  Household Food Security\n33. Concerns about food gaps in the annual cycle and lack of assets with which to obtain\ncash income to fill these gaps on the open market (food is available, but households cannot\nafford it), lead to adoption of low risk, low return production strategies. Hunger and malnutrition\nlead to ill health, with a general loss of productivity and high risks of relapsing into poverty\nbecause of medical crises or natural disasters. The Project\u2019s first priority, therefore, will be to\nincrease household food security among the client population. For many poor households, no\nother steps can be accomplished until this has been achieved. The component includes the\ndevelopment of home gardens, poultry, and occasionally fishponds for increased protein in\nhousehold  diets.  To  improve  poultry  productivity,  a  subsidized  vaccination  program  for\nNewcastle\u2019s  disease  among  poultry  will  be  introduced  for  three  years  to  demonstrate  the\nreduced losses obtainable. Clean water supplies will be provided to approximately 10,000\nhouseholds to facilitate home garden production, and to reduce the incidence of malnutrition\nresulting from waterborne diseases. Water will be provided primarily from the construction of\ncost-effective gravity systems (the majority) and shallow wells. Each scheme proposed for\nfinancing will be required to demonstrate that at least 50 percent of the beneficiary households\nare from the poorest households. To ensure that the benefits of clean water are maximized,\ntarget households will receive training in nutrition education and improved hygienic practices\nsuch as boiling water for drinking.\n2.  Income Generation\n34. Raising agricultural productivity and diversification of on-farm and off-farm sources of\nincome  constitute  important  elements  of  poverty  reduction  strategies  in  the  project  area.\nAccordingly, the income generation component consists of initiatives in microfinance services,\nagricultural production, and infrastructure development.\na.  Microfinance Services\n35. Improved access to microfinance services will enable small-scale farmers to purchase\ninputs  essential  for  productivity  improvements,  and  change  cropping  patterns  to  improve\nincomes. The promotion of financial savings among the poor also will enable them to establish\nlinks with formal credit markets, and improve their ability to finance on-farm, off-farm and\nnonfarm  investments.  Illustrative  items  to  be  financed  include  agricultural  inputs,  livestock\npurchase, feed for livestock fattening, fishpond development, agricultural tools, equipment for\nsmall-scale agro-processing, weaving and tailoring, and small machinery maintenance facilities.\nThe increase in production due to microfinance enables the poor to increase and balance their\nhousehold  consumption.  The  poor  consider  this  potential  consumption  increase  the  most", "12\nimportant benefit of production activities established under microfinance. In view of the need to\nsequence  food  security,  community  organization,  and  capacity  building  with  delivery  of\nmicrofinance services, the Project will combine the specialization of the Viet Nam Bank for\nAgriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), the principal rural finance institution, and the\nwomen\u2019s union\u2014the mass organization with considerable skills in social development.\n36. The microfinance services will be delivered primarily through groups, and with a flexible\nsystem capable of adapting to the evolving needs of the extremely poor communities in terms of\nloan size, repayment schedule, products and services, and delivery methodology. Most of the\nsavings  and  credit  groups  will  evolve  from  food  security  groups.  The  women\u2019s  union  will\nfacilitate the establishment of savings and credit groups, provide training in savings and credit\nmethodologies  (in  coordination  with  VBARD),  and  facilitate  service  delivery.  Low-income\nhouseholds already initiated in savings and credit methodologies and assessed as having the\ncapacity to utilize microfinance services will be able to access microfinance services directly\nfrom VBARD. At least 70 percent of borrowers are expected to be women. For credit eligibility\nthe  borrower  must  be  a  resident  of  the  project  area,  comply  with  the  savings  and  credit\nregulations, and (as applicable) be a member of a recognized group. Loans will not require\ncollateral or be tied to any specific activity and will depend upon the individual borrower, the\nassessment of his/her capacity to undertake the chosen activity by fellow group members, and\nrapid appraisal by VBARD. Loan sizes will depend on the demand and an individual member\u2019s\ncapacity, as assessed by the group, to manage loans of a particular size. The average first-time\nloans are expected to be lower than $150. VBARD\u2019s wider credit activities will help successful\nborrowers graduate to the commercial banking sector.\nb.  Agricultural Technical Support\n37. The Project will work with the district-based DARD extension centers to support farmer-\nmanaged demonstrations and will contract training on agricultural production from other local\nservice providers. The farmer field school (FFS) methodology, currently being applied nationally\nby the Plant Protection Division of DARD, will be introduced to the extension service in project\ndistricts. Trainers from the Plant Protection Division will be used to introduce the methodology\nacross  the  whole  extension  service  in  project  districts.  Demonstrations  will  focus  on  the\nopportunities and problems identified by farmers. District Support Teams (DSTs) and project\nconsultants will inform farmers of solutions found to similar problems elsewhere in the region\nusing videotape media, FFS demonstrations, and farm visits. Farmers will be encouraged to use\ncurrent best practices and to avoid introducing technologies untried in the area and the risks of\ncrop or market failure in a mono-cropping environment. Livestock investment has proved to be\nthe priority investment in similar conditions elsewhere in Viet Nam because of the traditional role\nof livestock in wealth accumulation, potential labor saving, fairly rapid cash earnings that can be\nreinvested in crop improvement, and side benefits in fertilizer availability. These assets are most\nat risk from disease. Village animal health workers and district livestock specialists will be\ntrained  and  equipment  provided  to  ensure  that  vaccines  could  be  properly  stored  and\ndisseminated. Farmers who invest in livestock will be expected to pay for vaccines although free\ndemonstrations  to  illustrate  the  benefits  will  be  provided.  Demonstration  nurseries  will  be\nestablished in all communes and support provided to start-ups to apply for credit from other\ncredit lines with VBARD. In addition, a local organization will be contracted to carry out detailed\nmarket studies of on-farm and off-farm products as well as nontimber forest products (NTFPs).\nThe contracted organization will identify new market opportunities and provide the information to\nfarmers.", "13\nc. Rural Infrastructure Development\n38. For  incomes  to  increase  among  the  target  population,  adequate  infrastructure  is\nnecessary to support microfinance and productive activities. The road network in the project\narea  is  poorly  developed.  The  condition  of  the  smaller  rural  roads,  which  link  villages  to\ncommune centers providing farmers with access to markets and services, is generally poor.\nThe majority of irrigation schemes in the project area are less than 50 ha and are usually\nmanaged by commune or village leaders. There are also numerous small farmer-built irrigation\nsystems, usually small stone, bamboo, and earth diversion structures that convey water to\nfields. They require constant maintenance and repairs and are often destroyed by floods.\n39. The Project will support infrastructure investment identified by the community. Indicative\ntargets include (i) improvement of up to 302 km of rural roads; (ii) construction of bridges, fords,\nand culverts; (iii) upgrading of up to 2,680 ha of small-scale irrigation schemes and up to 3,020\nha  of  new  small-scale  irrigation  schemes;  and  (iv)  support  for  village  home  garden  water\nsupplies (initially for household food security) through small gravity piped water supplies and\nshallow hand dug wells. All infrastructure proposals will be subject to environmental scrutiny\nthrough the SARD process and by the PMU environmental officers. For the first two years of\nproject implementation, each commune will be allocated approximately $50,000 per year for\ninfrastructure  investment.  Subsequent  allocation  to  communes  of  the  remaining  funds  will\ndepend on (i) progress in implementing the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SDPs); (ii) cost\nper head and number of poor households benefiting; and (iii) community contributions of cash,\nlabor, or beneficiary participation in planning, implementation, and O&M, with flexibility in difficult\ncircumstances.\n3.  Community Development\n40. The component will (i) strengthen the technical and organizational capacity of the rural\nupland communities to enable them to prioritize, plan, and manage their own development\nactivities; and (ii) assist target communities to form community organizations, strengthen the\ncommunity planning process and provide a resource base for communities to plan, finance, and\nimplement socioeconomic development activities. It will create the environment and conditions\nthat enable the poor to be organized through a support network that will improve the present\ndelivery system in favor of the poorest sections of the community. The community development\ncomponent will create awareness among the target population about the Project; assist the\npopulation to identify their needs, problems, and solutions; assist in training by disseminating\ntechnical information; facilitate information sharing on project implementation among the project\ncommunities, which may also stimulate project activities in communities with slow progress; and\nfacilitate data sharing and exchange for participatory monitoring and evaluation.\n41. The component requires the communities to prepare village development plans, which\nwill then be amalgamated into a commune SDP (already required under the Program 135). The\ncommune SDP will be designed taking into account the natural resources management plan\n(para.  42).  The  SDP  will  specify  activities,  responsibilities,  funding  requirements,  and  an\nimplemenation schedule. Commune-based monitoring and management committees (MMCs)14\nare tasked with facilitating approval and implementation of SDPs. They will be responsible for\nsubmitting the SDPs to the PMUs and the district administration for ratification, and will train\ncommunities on key elements of planning and administration. In each commune, one man and\n                  \n14 An MMC is a 9-member subcommittee of the commune people\u2019s committee. They were established under the\nProgram 135 in some communes to oversee infrastructure implementation and other decentralized activities.", "14\none woman will be selected by the community to act as commune facilitators. They will support\nthe PRA process and foster community action. At the district level, a five-person DST will\nsupport commune facilitators and district staff. DSTs will be developed to support the commune\nfacilitators  to  assist  the  formation  of  common  interest  groups.  The  Project  will  develop  a\nprocedural manual consisting of templates that can be rapidly adapted by groups to fit their\nmanagement and administrative needs.\n42. Results  of  GIS-based  surveys  of  the  project  area  will  be  made  available  for  each\ncommune to assist with a community mapping exercise.  This will be a key aspect of the\ncommunity planning process. Qualified organizations will be contracted to assist communities in\nthe development of management plans for common resources such as fishing areas, NTFPs, or\ngrazing lands. Proposals will be drawn up for ratifying access to protected and other forest\nareas on the basis of individual or community rights and responsibilities. These plans will then\nbe negotiated through district and provincial authorities, and will aim to develop provincial\nnatural resource management plans that focus on watersheds, rather than on administrative\nboundaries. The outcome of these plans will be reviewed at the end of the fourth year of the\nProject.\n4.  Institutional Strengthening\n43. Commune officials in the project area have had limited education and training. Many are\nunaware of new legislation or government procedures, have little background in the market\neconomy, and are unfamiliar with tendering procedures or PRA techniques. Selected MMC\nmembers responsible for the SDP process, along with district and provincial staff involved in the\nProject, particularly from the DPIs, will attend a one-month training course on implementing the\nSDP, at an institution such as the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) Business Training\nCollege in Da Nang. DARD will play an important role in implementation. In the project area\nDARD staff are unfamiliar with bottom-up extension principals although the plant protection units\nhave been implementing integrated pest management (IPM) using FFS methodologies. DARD\nstaff together with DST members will be trained in PRA techniques, FFS techniques, and\ncommunication skills.  Trainers from the DARD integrated pest management programs will be\nused for part of this training. Additional technical training will be given to DARD staff in subject\nmatter  identified  as  important  by  communities.  Training  will  be  provided  to  animal  health\nworkers in each commune to improve their ability to identify key diseases and provide an\neffective vaccination service. Provincial, district and commune-level women\u2019s union staff will\nreceive training in PRA techniques, communication skills, and microenterprise facilitation to\nenable them to assist with project implementation.\n5.  Project Support\n44. This component will provide the facilities and organizational management to implement\nthe Project. The Project will provide the PMUs with requisite resources including incremental\nstaff for project management and field-level implementation supervision, office space, office\nequipment, and vehicles. Consultant technical and advisory support (para. 68) also will be\nprovided to facilitate effective implementation of the Project.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n45. The project cost, inclusive of contingencies, taxes, and duties is estimated at $76.0\nmillion equivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $10.6 million (14 percent) and local\ncurrency cost of $65.4 million equivalent (86 percent). The cost estimates are summarized in\nTable 1 and detailed in Appendix 4.", "15\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponent Exchange Currencya Cost\nA. Base Cost\n1.

Financing Plan\n46. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of approximately $43.09 million equivalent from\nits Special Funds resources to finance approximately 57 percent of the total Project cost. The\nloan  will  finance  $6.6  million  equivalent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $36.5  million\nequivalent of local currency costs. The ADB loan will finance 92 percent of the household food\nsecurity  component,  67  percent  of  the  income  generation  component,  55  percent  of  the\ninstitutional strengthening, and 49 percent of project management. Grant cofinancing from the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) will fund the balance of\nforeign exchange cost estimated at $4.0 million and approximately $12.4 million equivalent of\nlocal currency costs. DFID financing will be used to meet 100 percent of the costs of consulting\nservices, approximately 70 percent of the costs of the community development component,\nincluding environmental monitoring, 5.8 percent of income generation activities, primarily for\ntraining and demonstrations, and 18 percent of project management costs. The Government\nand beneficiaries will finance the remaining local currency costs totaling approximately $16.5\nmillion. The proposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years\nwith an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per", "16\nannum thereafter to be paid semiannually. The Borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet\nNam.

The exceptionally high share of local cost financing is justified on several grounds. First,\nthe Project requires significant investment in rural access roads and irrigation facilities that are\nseverely lacking in the upland western areas of the four target provinces. Most of the investment\nand support activities have a high share of local inputs. Some of this work can be completed\nusing local labor. Second, with very low levels of household incomes and a limited revenue\nraising capacity at the provincial level, domestic savings are low and local governments depend\non central budgetary allocations to fund infrastructure development. The imbalance of public\ninvestment in rural infrastructure in the central region uplands compared to the lowland areas in\nother parts of the country implies a need to rectify the imbalance on equity grounds alone. The\nuse of loan funds to finance local currency costs may provide the needed incentive to allocate a\ngreater  share  of  the  public  expenditure  program  in  these  more  remote  areas.  Third,  the\nincidence  of  damage  to  existing  infrastructure  (roads,  irrigation  facilities,  and  other  public\nstructures) during the 1999 and 2001 floods in the Central Coastal Region has resulted in\nadditional demands on funds to rehabilitate these structures. Naturally, the Government has\nresponded to such claims from the coastal areas where most of the country\u2019s rural population\nresides and earns their livelihood. The need to rehabilitate after the floods has decreased funds\navailable under the public investment program to establish infrastructure in the more isolated\nand less densely populated upland areas of the four provinces. With these considerations and\nthe overall lack of domestic budgetary resources, ADB\u2019s assistance for funding a large share of\nlocal currency expenditures relating to this Project is justified.\nE.  Executing Agencies\n48. The Executing Agencies for all project activities except microfinance services will be the\nPPCs of Kon Tum, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien-Hue. This is in line with the\ndecentralized  project  process  approach  and  follows  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on\ndecentralization. According to Decision 38 of the Prime Minister, dated 24 March 2000, each\nprovince  has  one  steering  committee  responsible  for  running  all  national  target  programs,\nincluding Program 135, operating in the province. The head of this committee is the vice\nchairperson of the PPC. The PPCs will be responsible for (i) coordinating and managing the\noverall  Project  at  the  provincial  level,  including  coordination  with  external  funding  and", "17\ngovernment agencies; (ii) reviewing and approving of provincial project annual work plans and\nbudgets; and (iii) ensuring the necessary national-level approvals are obtained in a timely\nmanner to assist in project implementation.\n49. VBARD will be the executing agency for the microfinance subcomponent and will be\nresponsible  for  the  associated  institutional  strengthening  measures.  VBARD  has  had\nexperience in several projects funded by ADB, the World Bank, and bilateral agencies. VBARD\nperformed satisfactorily in implementing the ADB-funded Rural Credit Project15 and the World\nBank-funded Agricultural Diversification and Bank Modernization and Rural Finance projects.\nVBARD  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  implementation  procedures,  and  has  experienced  staff  to\nimplement the subcomponent.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management and Organization\n50. Day-to-day management will be delegated to provincial DPIs. A PMU will be established\nin each provincial DPI office. Each PMU will be headed by a project director, seconded from the\nDPI (either the director or deputy director of DPI), and will have access to the permanent heads\nof the line agencies that will be involved in implementation. Each PMU will have a permanent\nstaff of 11 including a deputy project director, an English-speaking certified accountant, one\nengineer,  one  administrator,  one  environmentalist,  one  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)\nspecialist, one bookkeeper, one interpreter, one driver, and two clerks, which will be incremental\nappointments to government. The PMU will be responsible for ensuring that initiatives identified\nthrough  the  PRA  process  in  villages  and  communes  are  incorporated  into  provincial\ndevelopment plans that are submitted annually for funding in the national budget.\n51. The PMUs will be equipped and provided with an operational budget as well as given\nextensive training in planning and reporting requirements of ADB and the Government. They will\neach receive one four-wheel drive vehicle to facilitate increased mobility within the upland areas\nof  the  provinces.  Part-time  responsibility  for  project  implementation  will  also  lie  with  the\npermanent heads of the departments of key line agencies. The PMUs will be responsible for\ncoordinating the activities of provincial line agencies and for ensuring counterpart funds are\nallocated for identified project initiatives. They will also coordinate the activities of the DST staff\nat district centers within the offices of DARD or DPI and procure goods and services in support\nof project initiatives. Specific responsibilities will include (i) to supervise, monitor, and manage\nconsultants and NGOs and/or local institutions; (ii) to implement, monitor, and review skills\ndevelopment and training activities funded under the Project; (iii) to procure equipment and\nvehicles for use by project staff and implementing agencies; (iv) to liaise with VBARD for\nmonitoring the disbursement of microfinance; and (v) to prepare workplans and carry out the\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  and  reporting  requirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  With\nconsulting  support,  the  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  planning  and  training  of  trainers  and\nbeneficiary  training  subcomponents.  For  training  of  trainers,  suitably  qualified  institutions,\nconsulting companies, and NGOs will be contracted to train participating government agencies,\nparastatal mass organizations, and commune and village leaders together with the commune-\nbased community facilitators and local community groups. The trained personnel will conduct\nbeneficiary training in the field covering all the components of the Project.\n                  \n15 Loan 1547-VIE(SF): Rural Credit Project, for $50 million, approved on 12 September 1996.", "18\n52. During  project  implementation,  a  participatory  process  will  be  adopted  with  poor\nbeneficiaries identifying initiatives to be implemented under the Project. Particular attention will\nbe given to ensure indigenous people, women, and other disadvantaged groups are included in\nthis  process.  Annual  work  plans  will  be  developed  based  on  discussion  between  the\nimplementing agencies, project staff, and the communities, to establish local priorities and\nreflect changes in community needs. These discussions may lead to component targets and\nactivities being changed, and may result in a need to reallocate resources within or between\ncomponents. Project component performance and achievements will also be reviewed with\nbeneficiaries in workshops at the end of each year. The interface between community-identified\nplans and service delivery will be the MMCs, which will ratify delivery of the agreed services.\nThe PMUs will also be responsible for holding annual seminars on \u201clessons learned\u201d from the\nProject, and will invite representatives of other projects operating in the province to make similar\n(\u201clessons learned\u201d) presentations. An organization chart is provided in Appendix 5.\na.  Household Food Security\n53. Approximately 20,000 households will be supported to develop home gardens. Typically\n2-3 women\u2019s groups (8-12 members each) will be formed among the households in each village\nidentified as poor, and 2-3 household food security promoters selected, one from each group.\nSelection will be made in consultation with the groups. The household food security promoters\nwill be trained to monitor the weight and height of all children in the project area on a monthly\nbasis  and  will  be  instructed  in  home  garden  productivity  and  related  nutrition  programs\n(combined with cooking guidance) using home garden produce. They in turn will train the\nwomen\u2019s groups. Ten model home gardens in each commune belonging to women\u2019s group\nmembers will be improved to act as demonstrations and visits to good models in neighboring\ncommunes/villages arranged. Much of the planting material will come from community sources\nand exchange programs, but additional material will be sourced through DARD.\n54. This component will be implemented by the women\u2019s union with technical input from\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD\u2019s) Household Food Security Unit, and will\ninvolve local health specialists in nutrition training. The health specialists will train trainers,\nDARD  staff,  women\u2019s  union  staff,  and  commune-appointed  home  garden  food  security\npromoters and monitor their activities. The women\u2019s union will play a key role in supporting the\nactivities of the promoters in their monthly weighing of children, and nutrition activities. DARD\nstaff, together with DSTs, will provide technical support to home garden demonstrations, will\nsource and provide planting material, and train beneficiaries to implement commune-identified\ndevelopment initiatives. NGOs and local institutions will be contracted to conduct training and\ndemonstrations in forest extraction and natural resource management, assisted by technical\nexpertise based at the PMU. The focal point of these activities will be the home-garden food\nsecurity promoters, who will receive extensive training, a monthly decreasing stipend, and\noperational support under the Project.\nb.  Income Generation\ni.  Agricultural Production\n55. Many of the income generating initiatives are directed at farming households through the\nintroduction of improved planting material, demonstrations, and FFS days. The district-based\nDARD plant protection and extension units will be responsible for implementing these initiatives\nin  response  to  problems  and  needs  identified  by  community  groups.  DARD  will  also  be\nresponsible for implementing the rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation schemes identified by", "19\nbeneficiaries, and will assist in the design and supervision of development of these schemes,\nand for the identification of equipment to be supplied for the village animal health workers to\nsupport their operations in the communes. DARD will be responsible for submitting annual work\nplans for such activities for consideration by each PMU and ratification by the applicable PPCs.\nOnce approved, the annual plans will be consolidated at the PMU and incorporated into the\nprovincial project annual workplan and submitted to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for funding\nunder the Project. DARD will be assisted by the expertise provided through the DSTs and the\ninternational and local consultant expertise provided under the Project. Each DST will include\nspecialists in agricultural production who will receive training in extension methodologies and\nsubject technologies. Among their responsibilities will be to provide specialist subject matter\nadvice and reporting during relevant planning activities, and to organize and supervise materials\nprocurement and technical support to demonstrations and farmer training through contracts with\npublic and private agricultural support services.\nii.  Microfinance Services\n56. The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange risk and relend the loan proceeds to\nVBARD  under  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB  as  set  out  in  a  subsidiary  loan\nagreement, including the following:\n(i)  Subsidiary loans will be denominated in local currency and will have a maturity of\n20 years with a grace period of 5 years on the principal. Repayment of principal\nand interest will be in equal semiannual installments. The relending rate will be\nvariable and based on the weighted average cost of deposits in the banking\nsystem determined by the SBV at the end of each quarter. VBARD will onlend to\nsubborrowers at an interest rate to recover its financial intermediation costs and\nto ensure that sufficient surplus remains with the poor households.16 Institutional\ndevelopment support including equipment and vehicles will mitigate some costs\nassociated with service delivery in uplands.\n(ii)  VBARD will bear lending risks and, therefore, will have the final approval in the\nselection of subprojects/subborrowers. It will also have the flexibility to determine\nthe  financing  needs  in  consultation  with  subborrowers.  In  the  first  cycle  of\nsubloans, amounts are expected to be less than $150 per loan. The subloan size\nis expected to grow by 15 to 20 percent in each successive cycle.17 VBARD will\nmake an equity contribution of up to 10 percent of the subproject cost, and\neligible subborrowers will provide at least 10 percent of the subproject cost in\nkind.\n(iii)  Subborrowers will be required to meet the following minimum criteria: be an\nindividual,  or  member  of  joint  liability  group;  if  a  current  borrower,  have  a\nsatisfactory credit history; be able to contribute a minimum of 10 percent equity,\neither cash or kind; agree to comply with savings and credit regulations; and\nhave  or  acquire  (through  project  support)  the  capacity  to  implement  the\nsubproject. Subprojects must be located in the project area, potentially profitable,\nand environmentally sound.\n                  \n16  Pursuant to prevailing SBV guidelines, the lending rate to subborrowers will be within 11.4 percent per annum for\nshort-term loans (the majority), and 13.8 percent per annum for long-term loans. Different rates for a short-term\nand long-term loan is based on the cost of deposits used to fund the loans, among other things.\n17  The 15-20 percent growth in the subloan size is based on the Grameen Bank experience.", "20\n(iv)  VBARD will make the required variations in its lending technology for service\ndelivery under the Project. VBARD will ensure that subprojects comply with the\nguidelines established by the Environmental Unit in VBARD under the ADB-\nfunded Rural Credit Project. Project-specific savings and credit regulations will be\nformulated and agreed by VBARD and women\u2019s union prior to implementation.\n57. VBARD will establish a microfinance unit at Da Nang Regional Representative Office to\nmainstream microfinance functions within the project provinces, coordinate the implementation of\ntraining of VBARD and women\u2019s union staff, and continually upgrade the microfinance delivery\nmethodology especially for mountainous areas. A revolving fund will be established at the Da\nNang office into which principal repayments of subloans will be credited. The revolving fund will be\nseparate from the imprest fund and will be used solely to finance eligible subprojects, until the\nobligations under the subsidiary loan agreement have been terminated. VBARD will assign two\nstaff, at least one of them female, for the microfinance unit to review and evaluate savings and\ncredit operations, collate and report project-specific data, maintain a microfinance library and\npublications, manage the revolving fund, and liaise with provincial executing agency. The PPCs\u2019\nmicrofinance unit will be the project-specific contact and focal point on all matters relating to\nmicrofinance. In addition, the Project Implementation Department and Credit Department at the\nVBARD head office, and the concerned provincial and district branches will participate in project\nactivities.  Consulting  services  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  VBARD  and  women\u2019s  union  in\nmicrofinance functions will be placed in the microfinance unit.\niii.  Infrastructure Support\n58. Infrastructure  initiatives  will  be  a  significant  part  of  the  overall  project  cost.\nImplementation of this subcomponent will be coordinated by DPI given its responsibility for\ncoordinating the provincial Public Investment Program, but day-to-day management will be with\nthe commune MMCs. These will receive support in the first three years from design engineers\nand other technical specialists from departments with line responsibility for various infrastructure\ntypes (e.g., DARD for irrigation, Department of Transport for roads). Villages and communes will\nprepare  their  prioritized  investment  proposals  for  road  and  other  appropriate  infrastructure\nthrough the PRA process resulting in a revised SDP that will be forwarded through the DPC to\nthe PMU. After consultation with the PMU to assure conformity with project objectives and\neconomic,  social,  and  environmental  viability,  the  SDPs  will  be  forwarded  to  the  PPC  for\napproval. Local counterpart funds will be assigned and the plans will be rationalized within the\nprovincial development plans. The SDPs will also be incorporated into the annual workplans by\nthe PMUs and forwarded to MPI and MOF for budgetary allocation (including loan funds).\nDuring the early stages of implementation, the PMU and district technical departments will help\nbeneficiary communes prepare and manage local tenders supported by the DST engineer and\nDepartment of Transport technical experts. During the later years of implementation, the MMCs\nwill be trained and experienced in operating independently to identify infrastructure investment\npriorities, prepare proposals for consideration by the higher administrations, and supervise\nconstruction of small-scale infrastructure.\nc.  Community Development\n59. The PMUs will manage the training of trainers\u2019 activities for the PRA training and supply\nthe equipment necessary to support community development initiatives proffered by commune\nMMCs. The PMUs will also be responsible for managing contracts for preparation of GIS\nresource maps and NGOs to support the PRA work in communes. Implementation of the village\nand commune PRA process will be managed by PMUs supported by NGOs and technical", "21\nexpertise in the DSTs. The NGOs, including those working in Viet Nam\u2019s protected areas, will\nundertake  the  benchmark  socio-economic  survey  (BMS)  and  much  of  the  community\ndevelopment training of support staff and of the beneficiaries where appropriate. Commune\nfacilitators will be provided for under the NGO contracts. The international monitoring and\nevaluation specialist will prepare a procedural manual for project monitoring and evaluation. The\nmanual will be designed to facilitate the evaluation process, giving templates and examples\nrather than prescriptive solutions. With the commune facilitators\u2019 assistance, common interest\ngroups will prepare commercial or other subprojects to meet identified community development\npriorities.  The  Commune  People\u2019s  Committee  (CPC)  will  be  responsible  for  selecting\nsubprojects,  their  implementation,  and  arrangements  for  the  subsequent  maintenance  and\nmanagement of the investments, with support from the DSTs and other government-support\nagencies. The commune MMCs will be responsible for validating payments for contractors.\nPayments  will  be  executed  by  DPI  on  certification  that  the  works  conform  to  technical\nspecifications.  The  international  rural  development  specialists  will  work  with  the  NGOs  to\ndevelop a procedural manual to assist in formation of groups. Funds will be available at the\ndiscretion of the MMC to facilitate regular community meetings and finance small productive\ncommunal activities. Commune accounts will be opened in a commercial bank at the district level\nto facilitate payment of small works, such as a footbridge, small-scale irrigation repairs, sloping\nland improvements, community houses, etc., and to pay for other supporting activities such as\ncommunity activity planning meetings. Such funds will not be available to individual initiatives or\nto finance social activities. DPCs will ratify SDPs and natural resource management plans, and\namalgamate them into the district plans to be submitted to the PMU and PPCs.\nd.  Institutional Strengthening\n60. The international training consultant together with a local institution will develop an\nintegrated one-month training course for key officials in the commune MMC responsible for\nimplementing the SDP. After the commune PRA exercises that identify the draft SDP, the\nselected commune officials will attend an interactive training session in Da Nang. Follow up\ntraining will be organized by PMUs and international and local consultants. Basic equipment and\noperational budgets will be provided to assist them in their task. Project staff and commune\nfacilitators  will  work  with  CPCs  to  ensure  that  the  MMCs  include  representatives  of  poor\nhouseholds and women. PMU staff, DPI officials, and other key provincial and district-level staff\nwill also receive support and training from international and local consultants so that PMUs can\nassume complete responsibility for planning and implementing the Project. DARD staff together\nwith DST members will be trained in PRA techniques, FFS techniques, and communication\nskills. Trainers from the DARD IPM programs will be used for part of this training, supported by\nthe international extension specialist. The domestic agriculture specialists will give additional\ntechnical training to DARD staff in subject matter identified as important by communities. Animal\nhealth workers in each commune will receive training to improve their ability to identify key\ndiseases and provide an effective vaccination service. DST staff will be trained at a local\ninstitution such as Hue University, which will develop appropriate training courses with the\nsupport of the international training specialist. Each DST will be equipped with a dual cab 4\nwheel-drive pick-up trucks and a complete video kit including editing equipment\n2.  Project Coordination\n61. A central project office (CPO) will be established in MPI to provide national-level support\nto the Project. It will provide coordination support to the proposed Project by (i) addressing\npolicy-level  issues  and  coordinating  with  central  and  provincial-level  authorities  on  issues\nrelevant to the proposed Project; (ii) providing guidelines to the PMUs to ensure consistency", "22\nwith  overall  government-development  objectives;  (iii)  ensuring  that  counterpart  funds  are\navailable in a timely manner, based on the ADB annual disbursement plan, for expedient\nimplementation; (iv) providing guidelines on the process from preparation through approval of\nannual feasibility studies and ensuring the necessary national-level approvals are obtained in a\ntimely  manner  to  facilitate  project  implementation;  (v)  monitoring  the  Project\u2019s  overall\nperformance  and  reporting  to  relevant  government  entities;  and  (vi)  organizing  the  two\ncomprehensive reviews to be held at the end of years 2 and 4 of the Project. The CPO will also\norganize annual workshops on lessons learned, which will include representatives from key\narea-based poverty-focused projects.\n62. A vice chairperson of the PPC will be appointed to be responsible for the overall project\nimplementation instead of setting up a provincial steering committee (para. 48). However, the\ncapacities within provincial offices to implement a project of this type are limited, particularly in\nterms of the ability to incorporate development initiatives identified at the lowest level focusing\non the needs of the poor into the provincial planning process. Thus, the vice chairpersons of the\nPPCs or their representatives will assume overall responsibility for the Project. The PMU in\neach province, under the management of DPI, will provide secretarial services for project-\nrelated matters to the responsible PPC provincial vice chairperson. The PPC will have the\nauthority  to  direct  participating  agencies  to  allocate  funds  in  support  of  Project-identified\ninitiatives. It is the highest committee in the province, and its involvement will (i) allow significant\nrefocusing of development needs of the poor and disadvantaged throughout the provinces, and\n(ii) help prevent unnecessary duplication of responsibilities of existing committees.\n3.  Project Implementation Schedule\n63. The project implementation period will be five years, commencing 1 April 2002 and\nending 31 March 2007. An implementation schedule is attached (Appendix 6). Among the first\nyear activities will be establishment of the project offices and accounts; preparation of the\nannual work plan; procurement of goods and services; a BMS, PRA, and needs assessment;\nphased implementation of commune activities, including preparation of SDPs, group formation\nfor household food security initiatives and credit and savings activities; identification of priority\ninfrastructure investments; and training of local government staff.\n4. Operations and Maintenance\n64. DPCs will have overall responsibility for O&M of upgraded roads, bridges, and culverts\nfinanced under the Project. Each province will ensure that sufficient government funds are\nallocated to the DPCs for O&M of this infrastructure. The O&M costs of small-scale irrigation\nfacilities,  small  markets,  and  village  microhydro  power  generation  investments  will  be  met\nprimarily  by  beneficiary  contribution  through  groups  such  as  water  user  groups  or  market\noperators that will be monitored by the commune MMCs. These very small-scale irrigation\nschemes have traditionally been entirely built and managed by the communities. Groups will\ndevelop a financing plan, including a fee collection plan or agreements as to local contribution in\nkind, where appropriate, for scheme maintenance. This will be a mandatory requirement for\nscheme approval. However, as their contribution in kind may not be sufficient to maintain all the\nstructures, additional resources will be provided by communes for infrastructure maintenance as\npart of their annual routine maintenance budget.", "23\n5. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n65. The project outputs will be monitored and evaluated in terms of efficiency (quantities\ndelivered) and effectiveness (quality of the goods/services delivered). Benefit monitoring and\nevaluation (BME) will generate data on the immediate effects and the broader impacts of project\ninvestments  on  socioeconomic  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  the  empowerment  of\nwomen and other disadvantaged groups. A BMS will be implemented at the start of the Project\nand commune facilitators will collect benchmark data as new communes enter the Project. A\nsignificant amount of the BME will be undertaken through group records and locally maintained\ndiaries to monitor the efficiency of project activities, e.g., the construction of irrigation and road\ninfrastructure. BME will comprise the following main elements: (i) The incidence of household\nfood insecurity will be monitored through the activities of the women\u2019s union and home-garden\nfood security promoters, and measurement of the incidence of child malnutrition. (ii) The impact\nof microfinance will be measured in terms of disbursements to and savings of savings and credit\ngroup  members,  and  the  impact  on  household  production/incomes  through  participatory\nmonitoring,  including  the  opinions  of  beneficiaries  as  to  the  suitability  and  timeliness  of\nmicrofinance initiatives. (iii) The benefits of rural infrastructure improvement will be estimated\nfrom reductions in transport charges, increases in farm gate prices, changes in transport modes,\nand changes in turnover of businesses served by upgraded infrastructure. The impact of road\nconstruction and improved irrigation facilities on agricultural production and other commercial\neconomic activities will also be assessed. (iv) The Project\u2019s impact on poverty will be monitored\nthrough collection of time-series data, assessment of the perceptions of the poor through PRA\non whether and how they have benefited, and performance against the goals established in the\nrevised  SDPs.  (v)  Beneficiary  participation  and  the  effect  on  institutional  capacity  of  local\ngovernment bodies will be monitored. (vi) Project impact on protected areas will be monitored.\nThe output of the BME will play a critical role in supporting quality improvements in service\ndelivery and in strengthening the effectiveness of project management. Clear mechanisms will\nbe developed to ensure that project processes and interventions can change and improve in\nresponse to feedback from the BME system. The project framework defines the key indicators\nthat will be used to monitor the performance of the Project in achieving its objectives.\n6. Procurement of Civil Works, Materials, and Equipment\n66. All procurement of civil works, materials, and equipment will be procured in accordance\nwith the ADB Guidelines for Procurement. Given that the value of each civil works contract will\nbe less than $1 million, civil works contracts are not expected to be of interest to international\nbidders.  Thus,  civil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  through  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The awarding of such contracts is expected to promote local\nemployment, private sector development, and continuity in future maintenance operations. A\nroster  of  prequalified  contractors  will  be  prepared  at  the  start  of  the  Project  and  updated\nannually, using procedures acceptable to ADB. Contracts for small-scale civil works, estimated\nto cost less than the equivalent of $10,000, may be awarded to the lowest-priced contractor on\nthe basis of a comparison of at least three quotations from local contractors. In addition, the\ncommunities themselves may carry out small works costing $1,500 equivalent or less (para. 59).\nContracts for supply of materials, vehicles, and equipment packages will be procured by (i)\ninternational competitive bidding for contracts valued at $500,000 or more; (ii) international\nshopping for contracts estimated to cost between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent; and (iii)\ndirect  purchase  for  small  or  off-the-shelf  items  valued  at  less  than  $100,000,  such  as\nmotorcycles and office equipment. Indicative procurement packages are included in Appendix 7.", "24\n7. Advance Action\n67. ADB has approved advance action for the recruitment of consultants to facilitate the\ntimely implementation of the Project. The Government has been informed that the approval of\nadvance action does not commit ADB to approve or finance the Project or any part thereof, and\ndoes not include retroactive financing.\n8. Consulting Services and Training\n68. A total of 575 person-months of consulting services, consisting of 126 person-months of\ninternational and 449 person-months of domestic consultant inputs will be provided under the\nProject (Appendix 8). Consultant inputs for the PMUs will be procured through two packages:\npackage  A,  consultant  inputs  for  Kon  Tum  Province,  consists  of  48  person-months  of\ninternational and 135 person-months of domestic expertise; Package B, consultant inputs for\nQuang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien-Hue provinces, consists of 78 person-months of\ninternational and 304 person-months of domestic expertise; and Package C, consultant inputs\nfor VBARD, consists of an individual domestic microfinance services specialist for 10 person-\nmonths. The NGOs for the community development component will be selected by ADB, in\nconsultation with the executing agencies, from an agreed upon shortlist, and on the basis of\nproposals submitted by the shortlisted organizations.  A similar arrangement will be adopted in\nrecruiting the NGO with experience in protected areas management to review the SDPs of all\ncommunes within or adjacent to existing or planned protected areas, and to assist communities\nin the development of management plans for common resources. The consultants and NGOs\nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The\nconsulting  services  and  NGO  contracts  will  be  financed  through  a  grant  from  DFID  and\nadministered by ADB. The Project will also contract out services to local institutions, and mass\norganizations to undertake institutional strengthening, and training activities. Engagement of the\nlocal institutions and mass organizations will follow a competitive procedure acceptable to ADB,\nbased on criteria agreed by the borrower and ADB.\n9. Reporting, Accounts, and Audits\n69. Each PMU will maintain separate ledgers, records, and accounts of expenditures and\nloan disbursements under the Project. The PMUs will install an accounting system consistent\nwith generally acceptable accounting principles acceptable to ADB. The project directors will\nprepare an annual financial report on the Project\u2019s accounts and submit these to the PPCs and\nMPI. An independent auditor acceptable to ADB will audit the accounts annually. The imprest\naccounts and statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be audited as part of the regular\naudit  of  the  Project\u2019s  account  and  financial  statements  and  audit  opinion  on  the  imprest\naccounts and SOEs will be set out separately. The audited project accounts will be forwarded to\nADB not later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year. VBARD will report separately\non  the  microfinance  activities,  providing  ADB  a  quarterly  progress  report  on  district-based\ndisbursements, collections, and arrears under the Project. VBARD will submit its audit report\ntogether with the auditor's opinion on the use of loan funds and the revolving fund to ADB within\nsix months of the closing of its financial year.\n70. During the first two years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual monitoring\nreviews. Initial reviews will (i) determine whether all the proposed implementation arrangements\nare in place; (ii) assess the progress of physical works and subproject implementation; (iii)\ncritically review the arrangements for, and results of, the beneficiary participation process; and", "25\n(iv) review the outcome of the institutional strengthening and training programs. In lieu of a\nmidterm review, comprehensive project reviews will be jointly undertaken by ADB, DFID, and\nthe Government at the end of years 2 and 4, to evaluate the physical and financial progress of\nthe  Project,  implementation  procedures,  procurement  performance,  BME  activities,  PMU\neffectiveness, and performance of consultants. In preparation for the comprehensive reviews,\neach PMU will prepare a comprehensive report identifying issues. On the basis of the results of\nthese comprehensive reviews, ADB, DFID, and the Government may consider changes in\nproject design and implementation arrangements. Within three months of project completion,\neach PMU will submit to MPI individual provincial project completion reports for consolidation by\nMPI in the standard ADB format, for submission to ADB. VBARD will submit to ADB, in standard\nADB format, a separate Project Completion Report on microfinance activities under the Project.\n10. Disbursement Procedures\n71. To ensure effective project implementation and timely disbursement of the loan, the\nGovernment will establish four imprest accounts at a commercial bank in each of the provinces\nto receive funds to meet project expenditures incurred by the PMUs. The initial amount to be\ndeposited into each provincial imprest account will be equivalent to an estimate of expenditures\nfor the first six months of project implementation. For microfinance activities, VBARD will open\nan imprest account at its Da Nang Regional Representative Office. ADB will advance three\nmonths of estimated expenditures into the imprest account. ADB\u2019s SOE procedure will be used\nto reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest accounts.\nThe SOE procedure will be applicable to contracts and individual payments not exceeding the\nequivalent  of  $100,000  to  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  simplified  procedures  on  procurement  and\ndisbursement. Each PMU will prepare reimbursement requests to be submitted to ADB through\nthe MOF. The microfinance unit will prepare the reimbursement request to be submitted to ADB\nby VBARD\u2019s head office through MOF. Subloans will be disbursed by VBARD\u2019s branches. The\nVBARD head office will reimburse the branches based on the quarterly reports submitted. MPI,\nin  its  project  coordination  role,  will  incur  some  limited  costs.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be\nestablished and maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Loan Disbursement dated\nJanuary 2001 and detailed arrangements between ADB and the Government. Relevant ADB-\napproved costs incurred by MPI in its coordinating role will be reimbursed based on submission of\nfull supporting documentation as per the ADB\u2019s Handbook. Each PMU will establish a commune\naccount in a commercial bank at the district level to facilitate payment of community-level small\nworks and supporting activities. The commune accounts will be funded from the respective\nimprest accounts.  The PMUs will submit to ADB SOEs in a format and at intervals to be agreed\nbetween the Government and ADB, showing the amounts disbursed into each commune account\nand expenditures made from each account. (An outline of fund flow arrangements is shown in\nAppendix 9).\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n72. The  Project  has  been  classified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Category  B,  and  an  initial\nenvironmental examination (IEE) has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental\nAssessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures. The IEE found that the\nProject will not create any significant changes in the social, physical, or biological environment\nand will conform to ADB\u2019s guidelines on environmental considerations. The potential impacts\nare  primarily  construction  related.  The  type  of  road  construction  will  be  rehabilitation  or\nimprovement of existing alignments. Little if any land acquisition is expected and mitigation", "26\nmeasures  to  address  any  potentially  minor  adverse  impacts  have  been  detailed  in  the\nmonitoring plan of the IEE. Microenterprises developed by the Project through microfinance\nprovision will also have no significant adverse impacts. Several enterprises (e.g., sloping land\nagriculture  development,  and  horticultural  development)  should  enhance  watershed\nmanagement and reduce soil erosion. A possible exception might arise in the case of any\nsubproject areas that are within, or adjacent to, existing or planned protected areas. An in-depth\nstudy, including a rapid biodiversity assessment, to assess potential environmental impacts of\nthe Project on the protected areas was completed and the results incorporated into the IEE and\nsummary IEE reports.18 In view of the importance of these areas, an independent group such as\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources or World Wide Fund\nfor Nature will be contracted to review SDPs of all communes within or adjacent to existing or\nplanned protected areas (para. 94, xi-xiii).\n2. Social Analysis\n73. A social assessment was carried out during TA implementation in compliance with ADB\nGuidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations to confirm the incidence of\npoverty and to identify commonalties in the nature and perceptions of the causes of poverty. The\nassessment comprised two main components: (i) a project area socioeconomic assessment\nsurvey,  and  (ii)  a  PRA  to  investigate  the  poverty  situation  and  development  problems  and\npriorities of selected communes. The results of the socioeconomic survey indicate that 75 percent\nof the population can be defined as poor according to the General Statistics Office/World Bank\noverall poverty line in Viet Nam.19 This result was supported by PRA exercises that indicated that\n53-92 percent of households in represented communes were ranked by the residents as poor or\nvery poor. Eighty seven percent of indigenous peoples\u2019 households and 81 percent of female-\nheaded households fall below the World Bank\u2019s overall poverty line. They are marked by illiteracy,\npoor housing, low level of household assets and equipment, poor health and access to services,\nand no cash or savings. Indigenous peoples in the project area are facing an influx of better-\neducated and richer Kinh. Women play a crucial role in the household food economy, and it will be\nvitally important that women are consulted and included in all aspects of project implementation.\n74. The Project will address the needs and concerns of the rural poor. Approximately 70\npercent of the Project\u2019s primary target beneficiaries will be indigenous peoples. Efforts will focus\non  improving  farming  systems  and  diversifying  incomes,  to  enable  indigenous  peoples  to\nparticipate more fully in the market economy. Diversification into perennial and industrial tree\ncrops will be promoted as an area in which indigenous groups can achieve an advantage. The\nProject will employ participatory processes and institute a planning system based on community\ndemand. A community organizing approach will be implemented to ensure the fullest participation\nby beneficiaries and that project activities address priority development issues identified by the\ncommunity.\na.  Gender Analysis\n75. The socioeconomic and PRA studies confirmed that women are disadvantaged in terms\nof education and literacy as well as in most of the usual quality of life indicators, particularly\nwhere there is a woman head of the household. Women in indigenous communities are usually\noverburdened with work, being responsible for most \u201clight\u201d but time-consuming duties such as\n                  \n18  In compliance with ADB\u2019s 120-day rule, a summary IEE was circulated to the Board on 7 June 2001.\n19 Defined as the income necessary to provide 2,100 calories per capita per day as well as meeting the cost for some\nessential nonfood items.", "27\ncooking; water and firewood collection; and caring for the sick, elderly and children. They are\nrequired to look after small livestock such as poultry and pigs, maintain home gardens, plant\nand weed rice and cash crops, and assist in the harvesting. They must mill and shell rice for\neach meal and collect NTFPs or search for other sources of cash or food in the dry season.\nUnfortunately, these duties are so numerous that the average woman has limited free time.\nGender analysis and awareness is required to ensure that the Project does not, unwittingly,\nfurther burden being of poor rural women through additional demands upon their already limited\ntime. The PRA studies showed that women placed a higher priority upon health (including clean\nwater) and education and in many respects provided a different perspective on the analysis of\ndevelopment  constraints  facing  their  community.  The  use  of  a  participatory  project\nimplementation  model,  employing  a  demand-based  planning  system  will,  if  used  properly,\nensure  that  women\u2019s  needs  and  aspirations  are  addressed  in  project  planning.  Exclusive\nwomen\u2019s groups will be formed during annual problem analysis and planning village meetings,\nand these will complement and supplement the needs information from men and mixed groups.\nb.  Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Plan\n76. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (2000), an indigenous peoples\ndevelopment plan (IPDP) was prepared for this Project. The IPDP is necessary because (i)\napproximately 60 percent of the population of the project area is made up of indigenous groups;\n(ii) while there is significant diversity among the groups, there are traditional patterns of resource\nuse and social organization that are distinct from the mainstream; and (iii) the Project has a great\npotential  to  reduce  poverty  among  indigenous  peoples  and  strengthen  their  traditional  local\ninstitutions. The IPDP provides a framework for the participation of all indigenous peoples\u2019 groups\nin the detailed planning and implementation of the Project and these mechanisms have been\ndeveloped through extensive consultations. The objectives of the IPDP have been incorporated\ninto the Project\u2019s detailed planning and implementation framework and will be addressed through\n(i) comprehensive consultations with the involved communities, a precursor to the development of\nSDPs for each commune; (ii) the MMCs formed under the Project to assist the communities to\nidentify, implement, and manage small-scale infrastructure projects having all local indigenous\ngroups represented in their membership; (iii) local indigenous groups being given priority for job\nopportunities arising from road rehabilitation; and (iv) the use of natural resource management\nplans and GIS maps of communes to resolve land disputes and to help indigenous groups gain\nrecognition for traditional land use patterns. The PMU will be responsible for BME of the IPDP.\nThe data gathered on commune entry by commune facilitators in each of the indigenous groups\nwill be used as base line indicators to monitor the Project\u2019s impact on each group.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analysis\n77. The  Project  is  justified  on  both  efficiency  and  equity  grounds.  From  an  efficiency\nviewpoint, the need for the Project arises from the undersupply of community development\nservices to remote rural areas and underinvestment in institutional support and infrastructure\nservices. This deficiency will largely be addressed by providing training and support services to\nlocal people so as to improve their participation in development planning and implementation in\ntheir communes. Enhancement of the human and social capital of beneficiaries will be a major\noutcome. Such an approach will help to address the equity issue by ensuring that locally\nidentified community needs are explicitly recognized in Government development plans, leading\nto  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  public  investments.  Although  Viet  Nam  has  achieved\nconsiderable success in recent years in reducing the incidence of poverty, not all poor groups,", "28\nparticularly those in upland areas, have benefited equally. The Project will go some way to\naddressing this deficiency within the participating central region communities.\n78. While the main objective of the Project is poverty reduction in the broadest sense, the\nmain justification for its activities lies with changes in household incomes. As the output from\nproject-financed  activities  will  largely  be  determined  by  a  commune-level  demand-driven\nprocess, the likely mix and scale of such outputs cannot be reliably predicted. Furthermore, it\nhas not been possible to quantify the long-term benefits of the human capital development\nactivities  under  the  community  development  and  institutional  strengthening  components.\nTherefore, a full benefit-cost analysis for the Project is not practical (Appendix 10).\n1.  Beneficiaries\n79. The Project area consists of approximately 65,000 households, of which about 48,500\nare poor. This latter group, comprising about 257,000 people, will be the primary focus for\nproject activities. The Project allows for around 20,000 poor households (106,000 persons) to\nparticipate in home garden activities, including up to 10,000 households who will have the\nopportunity to improve their home garden water supplies. As the food security position of these\nhouseholds improves, many are expected to participate in the income generation activities\nunder the Project. Project resources, including complementary infrastructure investments and\nmicrofinance services, will allow about 31,500 households to participate. Actual beneficiary\nnumbers will be determined in part by the outcome of a range of project-supported activities\nincluding  community  development,  infrastructure  construction,  land  use  planning  and  land\nallocation, and market studies.\n2.  Benefits\na.  Farms\n80. At  the  household  level,  improvements  to  the  extension  service,  training,  access  to\nmicrofinance and improved road and irrigation systems will result in changes to farming systems\nleading to increased crop, livestock, and fisheries production. Investments in home garden\nwater supplies supported by advice on home garden management will improve the nutritional\nstatus of householders, particularly children, and contribute to improve household food security.\nImproved commune-based resource planning and support for beneficiaries seeking title to land\nwill also contribute to increased production. Financial budgets for eight representative models\nhave  been  prepared  using  PRA  and  other  field-survey  data  to  define  the  without-project\nsituation. The models are representative of the main agro-climatic and land capability zones in\nthe project area, and typical farm sizes identified during TA fieldwork have been adopted. As the\nbasis  for  the  household  models,  enterprise  budgets  for  six  annual  crops  (irrigated  and\nnonirrigated),  six  perennial  crops,  four  livestock  activities,  and  a  NTFP  activity  have  been\nestimated. Enterprise mixes adopted in the household models reflect those found in the various\nagro-climatic and land use zones. All of the models are financially viable, with financial rates of\nreturn all exceeding 50 percent. Incremental incomes range from $85 (D1.20 million) to $387\n(D5.50 million), a significant increase on existing incomes. These returns should provide a\nstrong incentive for beneficiary participation.\nb.  Roads and Irrigation Schemes\n81. PRA findings show that households in the area place a very high value on being able to\ngain easier and more reliable access to commune centers to reach services such as education", "29\nand health. Apart from this social benefit, vehicle-operating costs are likely to fall in response to\nimproved road conditions and competition will suffice to ensure that cost savings are reflected in\nreduced transport charges. While the benefits from road construction are likely to contribute\nsignificantly to incremental output on farms, they are difficult to quantify and are not specifically\nincluded in the analysis. Benefits from investment in new or upgraded irrigation schemes will\ninclude an expansion in the irrigated area, an improvement in the reliability of water supply, and\na reduction in maintenance costs as simple farmer-built diversion structures are replaced with\nmore permanent\u2014but still simple\u2014structures. These benefits will be reflected in increased\ncropping intensities and a change from lower to higher value crops on farms. The value of these\nchanges has been included in the household models described above.\nc.  Nonquantified Benefits\n82. A range of nonquantifiable benefits will be generated by the Project. These will include\n(i) a saving in travel time, particularly for those currently using nonmotorized transport on earth\nsurfaced tracks; (ii) improved delivery of technical support services such as agriculture and\nforestry extension services, in terms of access to the service and the quality of information\nprovided; (iii) improved access to isolated villages enabling other Government services, such as\nhealth and education, to be more effectively delivered; (iv) lowered prices of general consumer\ngoods due to reduced transport costs; (v) the opportunity to change production to higher value\nperishable crops through improved access to markets; (vi) an improvement in the general\nbusiness  environment  engendered  by  more  reliable  and  cheaper  transport  services  and\nimproved access to microfinance services; (vii) improved well-being through the establishment\nof  convenient  water  sources  allowing  more  time  for  income  generating  or  other  activities,\nparticularly for women; and (viii) improved community access to barren and other unused lands\nand to forests for collection of NTFPs that will increase incomes in a sustainable manner.\n83. Benefits from the small-scale infrastructure projects to be implemented in communes will\ninclude improved access to safe water supplies and availability of community meeting or market\nplaces.  In  some  communes,  mini  hydropower  schemes  will  be  feasible  with  availability  of\nelectricity resulting in a sharp improvement in living standards. Community mobilization and\nempowerment activities carried out by contracted NGOs, commune facilitators, and DSTs will\nhave  long-term  benefits  in  improved  community  decision-making  processes  and  improved\nimplementation  and  management  capacity  at  this  lowest  level  of  administration.  At  the\ninstitutional level, commune staff and staff of provincial DPIs and other implementing agencies\nwill have the opportunity to work closely with project management staff and consultants. This\nwill provide an opportunity for them to upgrade their skills in project design and implementation.\nFinally, the capacity of the women\u2019s union to deliver microfinance services and to provide\ngeneral development support to communities through group activities will be enhanced.\n3.  Subsidies, Recurrent Budget Implications, and Sustainability\n84. Direct subsidies will be limited to the vaccination programs under the household food\nsecurity  component.  An  initial  subsidy  period  is  necessary  as  an  incentive  for  beneficiary\nparticipation. Cost recovery for vaccinations will subsequently be phased in over a three-year\nperiod in each participating commune. Beneficiaries will, however, continue to draw on the free\nadvisory services currently provided by government agencies in the area. Demand for these\nservices is expected to rise as confidence in their quality increases.\n85. Local governments and beneficiaries will jointly meet O&M costs of infrastructure to be\nfinanced under the Project. For roads, the local contribution, mainly provided as labor and local", "30\nmaterials,  will  be  30  percent  of  the  cost.  Beneficiaries  are  expected  to  handle  routine\nmaintenance such as the repair of potholes and cleaning of drains, while the government will\nhandle periodic maintenance such as restoration of washouts. For irrigation maintenance, the\nbeneficiary contribution will be 70 percent. For other infrastructure such as household garden\nwater supplies, local government authorities and communities will be encouraged to establish a\nsystem of user charges to cover maintenance and replacement costs. The O&M costs of\ninfrastructure after project completion is estimated at $990,000. O&M of vehicles and office\nequipment to be financed under the Project will become a government responsibility at project\ncompletion and budget provision will be needed for this. Other government recurrent costs\nextending beyond the five-year project investment period are limited to the salary and operating\ncosts of monitoring and environmental specialists recruited under the Project.\n86. A  central  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  capacity  of  communities  and\ncommunes  in  development  planning  and  implementation.  This  approach  will  lead  to  the\nimplementation of small projects that meet the needs of local people and in which they will have\na sense of ownership. By the end of the Project, community leaders will have received training\nin participatory techniques, planning, and implementation monitoring. At least two cycles of\nsocial development plan updating and incorporation into district and provincial budgets will have\nbeen assisted in each project commune. In addition, a number of locally recruited community\nfacilitators will have received participatory skills training and they will be available to help sustain\nthe  community-based  consultation  and  planning  processes.  Under  these  conditions,  the\ncommunity development activities initiated under the Project are likely to be sustainable. In turn,\nO&M of the infrastructure schemes to be financed will be more sustainable than had a top-down\nplanning  process  been  adopted.  Before  construction  of  any  infrastructure  scheme  starts,\nbeneficiaries will be assisted to form user groups. These groups will be closely involved in\nmanaging and supervising construction and will subsequently be responsible for O&M. Groups\nwill  develop  a  financing  plan,  including  a  fee  collection  plan  or  agreements  as  to  local\ncontribution in kind, where appropriate, for scheme maintenance. This will be a mandatory\nrequirement for scheme approval.\n4.  Project Risks\n87. Key implementing agencies such as DARD and the women\u2019s union have limited capacity\nat district or commune level, and CPCs have often been ineffectual at implementing government\ninitiatives under the Program 135. Capacity does exist at province level but outside of Quang\nBinh and Thua Thien-Hue, the project provinces have limited experience of providing support to\ncommunities  in  remote  areas.  To  ameliorate  the  risk  (i)  each  PMU  will  be  supported  by\nexpertise  in  project  and  financial  management;  (ii)  capacity  building  will  be  provided  for\ncommune officials, community organizations, and implementing agencies; and (iii) support from\nNGOs  and  local  institutions  will  be  contracted  to  provide  a  mix  of  services  to  facilitate\nimplementation.\n88. The  project  implementation  period  of  five  years  requires  intensive  community\ndevelopment efforts and capacity building during the first year. In addition to efforts under the\ncommunity development and institutional strengthening components, separate advisory TA20 will\nsupport  the  Project  in  developing  appropriate  approaches,  systems,  and  procedures  for\nplanning and managing a community-based participatory development model. The TA will be\nimplemented in advance of the Project, and will develop (i) an approach to planning and\n                  \n20 TA 3772-VIE: Capacity Building for Central Region Poverty Reduction, for $3.73 million, approved on 14 November\n2001.", "31\nmanagement that is appropriate to the institutional environment and resource capacity of the\narea, and (ii) systems and procedures for planning, budgeting, and monitoring financial and\nimplementation activities.\n89. Participatory processes are an important element in the selection and prioritization of\nmany project activities. Provincial authorities are familiar with PRA but tend to use it as a one-\ntime consultative event. The Government and ADB will carry out semiannual reviews during the\nfirst two years of project implementation, with in-depth reviews at the end of the second and\nfourth years of the Project.\n90. A significant increase in the annual provincial road maintenance budget will be required\nfor these and other project-financed infrastructure to be maintained satisfactorily. The Project\nincludes  and  will  monitor  the  Government  allocation  for  infrastructure  maintenance  during\nimplementation.  The  Project  will  help  communities  form  and  operate  user  groups  with\nmaintenance responsibilities for irrigation and water supply subprojects and powers to collect\nuser fees.\nB.  Environment\n91. A critical feature of the Project is its focus on developing innovative natural resource\nmanagement strategies linked to social development objectives. By taking action to increase\nincome  and  improve  food  security,  the  need  for  many  rural  households  to  resort  to\nunsustainable exploitation of their limited resources or to seek early opportunities for economic\nmigration to urban centers will be much reduced. The Project offers the potential to bring about\nsignificant environmental benefits through promotion of agricultural and forest management\npractices that are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable. This would include\nthe  correction  of  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  present  unsustainable\nlivelihood practices, land allocation systems, and inadequately constructed and maintained\ninfrastructure.\nC.  Social Dimensions and Project Impact on Poverty\n92. The  overriding  feature  of  the  project  interventions  is  the  intended  improvements  to\nlivelihood and food security as a primary means to improve the quality of life of the rural poor.\nThe Project has been designed to address some of the critical development needs identified by\ncommunities  during  participatory  meetings  and  problem  ranking  exercises.  The  majority  of\nsurveyed families had incomes below the General Statistical Office/World Bank food poverty\nline, placing them with the poorest of the poor. Only through livelihood security may a household\nundertake and absorb the livelihood risk associated with diversification and innovation. Once a\nhousehold has attained improved security, it can develop a strategy for escaping poverty,\nincluding  investments  in  education,  land,  or  livestock.  Project  interventions  to  help  raise\nincomes include microfinance and training for microenterprise development and provision of\ntechnical services. Investments in rural infrastructure are expected to lead to higher productivity,\nlower transport costs, improved access to markets and government services, and growth of\nsmall  businesses  within  the  project  area.  Women  will  benefit  from  a  number  of  targeted\ninterventions. Poultry rearing will provide an opportunity for income generation and improved\nhome gardens will reduce malnutrition of both women and children. Women will be given priority\nas borrowers in the microfinance programs.\n93. Successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  develop  assets  among  the  target\npopulation, who will benefit from new or improved skills; increased earning opportunities and", "32\nincomes; better community organization; greater access to productive assets, infrastructure,\nand  economic  and  social  services;  and  improvements  in  the  abilities  of  district  and  local\nadministrations to deliver services in response to demand. The Project will therefore contribute\nto capacity strengthening on two main levels, the community and the implementing agencies.\nImproved health, awareness, and vocational skills, combined with community organization will\nimprove the assets of the poor in their competition for economic resources. The Project will\nidentify areas of income generation that are more favorable to indigenous groups and focus on\nthose in which the community has a relative advantage to exploit. In terms of agriculture these\nare predominantly small-scale livestock and tree crops such as fruit, tea, coffee, and other\nindustrial tree crops. Other opportunities include handicraft production and the exploitation of\nNTFPs on a sustainable basis. The Project will facilitate the renewed entry of the rural poor into\nthe market economy. Accordingly, the potential impact on household incomes through these\nmeasures is high.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n94. The Government has provided the following assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal document.\n(i)  Sufficient counterpart funds for 16 months of operations, including all allocations\nfor staffing and the implementation of this Project, will be available in project\naccounts at the start of each financial year.\n(ii)  Project facilities upgraded under the rural infrastructure component of the Project\nwill be properly operated and maintained as follows: (a) communes will carry out\nroutine  maintenance,  (b)  the  DPCs  will  carry  out  periodic  maintenance  of\nimproved rural roads and irrigation using their annual maintenance budget, (c)\nthe provinces will submit annually to the Government budgets to cover the cost of\nroutine and periodic maintenance of structures improved under the Project, and\n(d) the Government will include in its annual budget adequate provision for the\nlocal government authorities to carry out such maintenance.\n(iii)  The PMUs will ensure that there is appropriate representation of women from\nindigenous groups in community mobilization and training programs under the\nProject, and that the women\u2019s union and NGOs focus on supplying services to\nindigenous peoples and women, and that at least 70 percent of the subborrowers\nunder the income generation component of the Project are women.\n(iv)  The  PMUs  will  make  available  GIS-based  surveys  and  community  maps  to\nfacilitate development of Natural Resource Management Plans for the project\narea.\n(v)  State-owned enterprises can only be eligible to bid for contracts if they are legally\nand financially autonomous, independently managed and operating on the basis\nof commercial practices, and if they are not in any way associated with the\nmilitary forces.\n(vi)  Commune accounts will be opened in a commercial bank at the district level to\nfacilitate payment of community-level small works and supporting activities.", "33\n(vii)  Within three months of effectiveness, VBARD will establish a revolving fund at its\nDa Nang Regional Representative Office to be maintained throughout project\nimplementation  and  to  be  used  exclusively  for  the  financing  of  eligible\nsubprojects. All payments of principal and interest received from subborrowers\nwill be credited to the revolving fund, after debt servicing payments under the\nsubsidiary loan, and used for making new subloans.\n(viii)  SBV, MOF, and VBARD will, together with ADB, carry out annual reviews of the\nperformance of the microfinance subcomponent, including reviews of the interest\nrates  applicable  to  the  subsidiary  loan  and  the  subloans  to  ensure  that  the\nspread is adequate to cover VBARD\u2019s operational cost in relation to the Project.\n(ix)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, VBARD will establish a monitoring\nsystem  with  key  indicators  to  measure  the  performance  of  the  microfinance\nservices under the Project and a breakdown of subborrowers by gender.  VBARD\nwill ensure that adequate systems and procedures to implement the microfinance\nservices subcomponent are in place throughout the provision of these services.\n(x)  A  Microfinance Manual will be finalized by VBARD and the women\u2019s union within\nthree months of loan effectiveness.\n(xi)  All mitigation measures to address the environmental impacts identified in the\nIEE will be properly implemented, in accordance with the ADB Environmental\nAssessment Guidelines and  Government  environmental  safeguards  and  in\nrelation  to  SARD  procedures,  safety  standards,  soil  erosion,  and  sanitation\nmeasures, in accordance with the relevant governing environmental laws and\nregulations.\n(xii)  No project activities will start in communes in national parks and protected areas\nuntil  all  the  supplementary  environmental  studies  have  been  completed  and\napproved by ADB, and local land use controls have been prepared that limit\nsettlement in protected area communes.\n(xiii)  The Project will not finance any SDPs that are likely to impact on existing or\nplanned protected areas unless an independent expert group (para. 72) has\nparticipated in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the plans, and has\ncertified its suitability for support under the Project.\n(xiv)  VBARD will ensure that each subproject is in compliance with the environmental\nguidelines established under the ADB-financed Rural Credit Project (footnote\n15).\n(xv)  The PMUs will ensure that representatives of indigenous groups in all communes\nor  villages,  particularly  those  where  indigenous  peoples  are  a  minority,  are\nincluded in the PRA-participatory community development process, and that their\nconcerns are given priority.\n(xvi)  The PPCs will support communities in acquiring land use rights in accordance\nwith the laws of Viet Nam.", "34\n(xvii)  Information  on  implementation  of  the  IPDP  will  be  included  in  the  quarterly\nprogress  reports  and  comprehensive  year-end  annual  Project  Performance\nReport to be submitted to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s project performance\nmanagement systems.\n(xviii)  No  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  support  further  sedentarization  of  ethnic\nminorities and resettlement of Kinh or other major ethnic groups into the project\narea.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n95. Prior to loan effectiveness\n(i)  A  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  Borrower  and  VBARD  will  have\nbecome effective; and\n(ii)  Confirmation from DFID will have been obtained that the DFID grant has been\napproved.\nVII.

Socioeconomic Indicators\n1. There are different definitions of poverty, as indeed there must be to capture the different\nways in which this condition is manifest. Poverty can be expressed as a caloric daily intake, or\nas a dollar per capita income figure, or it can be expressed as a condition impacting on the\nquality of life. In the recently published, UNDP Poverty Report 2000,1 two basic classes of\npoverty are defined.\n(i)  Income poverty has two subsets (a) absolute or extreme poverty, defined as a\nlack of income necessary to satisfy basic food needs (this is usually defined as\nminimum calorie requirements); and (b) relative or overall poverty, defined as\nlack  of  the  income  necessary  to  satisfy  essential  food  needs  and  nonfood\nneeds, such as clothing, energy, and shelter.\n(ii)  Human  poverty  is  marked  by  a  lack  of  basic  human  capabilities;  illiteracy;\nmalnutrition; reduced life expectancy; poor maternal health and illness from\npreventable disease; and lack of access to goods, services, and infrastructure,\nsuch as energy, sanitation, education, communication, and drinking water, that\nare necessary to basic human capabilities.\n2. The project area has been selected based on key poverty indicators including those\nmonitored by both the Committee for Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas and the Ministry of\nLabor, Invalids, and Social Affairs. The 10 districts selected for project implementation have\nbeen identified as among the poorest in Viet Nam. In the targeted project areas, beneficiaries\nare predominantly subsistence, upland, ethnic minority farming families (some 60 percent of the\npopulation). This marginalized population has been specifically targeted due to the obvious\nwealth gap and disparity in the quality of life compared to other populations. These communities\ndisplay characteristics of both income and human poverty. They are caught in the poverty cycle.\nThey  usually  depend  on  subsistence  agriculture,  partly  using  traditional  farming  systems,\ncharacterized by little or no technological inputs, which rely on shifting the area cultivated every\nsecond or third year. Fallow has been greatly reduced, from ideal fallow periods of up to 20\nyears, down to an unsustainable three-year period.\n3. Ethnic minority agriculture was efficient when land was not a constraint. It used large land\nareas and had high returns to labor. It is inefficient in terms of returns realized from land,\nparticularly when compared to yields from the intensive systems usually adopted by the Kinh\nethnic majority. Hill rice production yields generally range from 750 to 2000 kilograms/hectare\n(ha).  There  is  usually  only  the  opportunity  to  grow  one  crop  per  year,  as  most  of  these\ncommunities do not have irrigation. Better income and returns to labor in upland agriculture are\nrealized from perennial industrial crops, and Kinh in-migrants to the upland areas appear well\naware of this trend. Whereas paddy land is occupied by original inhabitants, the in-migrants are\nusually taking up land areas suitable for cultivating these perennial crops and appear to have\nbetter access to irrigation (Tables A2.1, A2.2, and A2.3) agriculture demonstrations.\n4. The Kinh majority will also obtain better returns from raising livestock (Table A2.4), and\nthis is more than likely due to knowledge of and proximity to markets, and a better awareness of\n                  \n1 United Nations Development Programme. 2000. Poverty Report 2000: Overcoming Human Poverty. New York, NY.", "43 Appendix 2, page 2\nanimal husbandry. Ethnic minorities raise livestock based on traditional systems, resulting in high\nlosses due to death from disease. They do not have access to or funds for veterinary services, or\nto adopt better husbandry technology. The Kinh usually have 50 percent more large livestock\n(buffalo and cattle), and almost three times the number of poultry that their indigenous minority\ncounterparts have.

The high incidence of poverty highlighted in the socioeconomic survey reflects the general\nmarginalization  of  upland  areas.  The  socioeconomic  study  also  shows  that  female-headed\nhouseholds are more likely to suffer poverty. This trend is common to developing countries and\nmany  western  communities.  Poverty  in  marginal  upland  communities  is  characterized  by  low\nincome and no savings. Households usually suffer from a food production deficit for at least\nseveral months each year, and this can vary widely, with the more extreme hardship families\nhaving to endure a food production deficit for up to 10 months per year. The socioeconomic study\nindicated that whereas Kinh households average a food production deficit of around 3 months per\nyear, indigenous households average over 5 months. In these situations, fairly similar livelihood\ncoping mechanisms have evolved regardless of location, but depend on the environment. The\nmost common mechanisms are hunting, gathering, and foraging in the forest for alternative foods\nand nontimber forest products, which are consumed or sold. Some communities are skilled at\nhandicrafts, such as silk production, weaving, basket making. A few have the opportunity to seek\noff-farm work. Per capita incomes are normally less than $200 per year, and this is often the total\nhousehold income figure. Land use planning and land allocation, while not a direct cause of\npoverty, is certainly a contributing factor and is a main constraint to land use management and\nrehabilitation programs. Some communities appear to not understand the ramifications of the land\nallocation process, selling land that has been allocated to them for a quick profit or to meet urgent\nneeds, and becoming landless as a result.\n6. The  isolated  upland  communities  do  not  have  access  to  basic  health,  sanitation,  or\neducation services, and lack knowledge of basic hygiene and illness prevention. A very small\nproportion  of  any  village  population  is  over  the  age  of  55  years  (averaging  10-12  percent).\nIndigenous people have less cash than the Kinh population and therefore spend less on health\ncare. Minorities spend only 14 percent of the amount that Kinh people spend on health care, even\nthough they report a similar number of sick days. The definition of \u201csick\u201d varies between the\nminorities to the Kinh. The minorities are less likely than the Kinh to regard minor ailments as being\nsufficient to warrant taking time off from working, due to necessity, access, and cost. Clean water\nsupplies are insufficient, especially in the dry season. Poor quality water is the main cause of\nchronic diarrhea diseases, a major cause of child deaths.\n7. The communities suffer from a high level of illiteracy, particularly among the women. Men\ncan usually be found who can speak the official local language, but may not write it. Many women\nonly speak their specific ethnic dialect. Attendance at school by young children is usually low.", "46 Appendix 2, page 5\nAttending school is considered less valuable than contributing labor to the family farm. Research\nshows a reverse correlation between child mortality and (i) the level of the mother\u2019s education, and\n(ii) family size. Better education leads to increased awareness; literate people are able to access\nreading  material,  and  understand  information,  education,  and  communication  materials.  The\nsocioeconomic  study  indicated  that  indigenous  peoples  were  disadvantaged  in  literacy,  and\ntherefore numeracy. This inhibits knowledge and understanding of government services and how\nto access these, as well as understanding new technology and how it may be applied.\nTable A2.6: Education Level of the Population in the Project Provinces\n(percentage)\nEducation Category Q.Binh Q.

The isolation and poor access makes it very difficult for government service agencies to\nvisit  and  assist  these  communities.  Roads  and  bridges  are  often  impassable  during  the  wet\nseason, and agency staff prefer not to go to villages where access is difficult, or even dangerous.\nAccess also constrains the development of better market linkages and increased participation in\nthe cash economy. At present these communities are on the fringes of the cash economy. Poverty\nalleviation and environmental management projects in upland areas must therefore be justified on\nsocial equity terms, not economic returns. In a market-driven economy, where there is competition\nfor economic resources, the uplands are already at a disadvantage. Thus, government must fill the\ninvestment gap or the wealth and quality of life disparity between rural and urban populations will\nworsen. Government-subsidized investment credit capital will be needed for upland communities,\nas the capital markets will not otherwise flow to such areas.\n9. The studies undertaken by the project indicate that the socioeconomic status of upland\ncommunities can be improved through a comprehensive, integrated development program that will\nimprove  transportation  access,  improve  access  to  and  awareness  of  government  services,\nincrease  literacy,  and  intensify  farming  systems,  and  promote  diversification  into  perennial\nindustrial crops. It is also necessary to provide microfinance and strengthen both community-\nbased and government institutions and organizations, to introduce a focused development effort\ninto these areas, which have been left behind.", "EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE\nRural Development Projects Ongoing in Central Region Provinces\nProject Name Agency Amount Duration Location\nAgricultural Resources Conservation IFAD and Loan financing of $12.5 million with 1996 to 2001 Quang Binh\nand Development Project UNDP grant financing of $3 million.\nHa Tinh Rural Development Project IFAD Loan financing $15.4 million.
