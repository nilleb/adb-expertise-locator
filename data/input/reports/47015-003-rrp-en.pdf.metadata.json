The program  supports the \nNational Power Policy, 2013 of the Government of Pakistan, which seeks to build an affordable, \nreliable, sustainable, and secure energy sector to support the country\u2019s economic growth.2 The \nprogram, fully coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under  its extended fund \nfacility,3 takes a phased approach over multiple years to provide dynamic, long-term support to \nmultidimensional  reforms,  with  subprograms  that  match  the  government\u2019s  budget  cycle.  The \nIMF  completed  its  final  review  in  September  2016.4 The  World  Bank  and  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  cofinanced  subprograms  1  and  2,  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  will  cofinance  subprogram  3,  which  is  the  third  and  final  year  of  the \nprogrammatic approach5 and builds on the reforms initiated during previous subprograms. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic reforms are a priority of the Government of Pakistan. In 2017, the World Bank \nrecognized  Pakistan  as  among  the  countries  with  the  most  improved  business  environment.6 \nAfter 10 failed attempts, Pakistan successfully completed an IMF program in 2016. Apart from \nminor  deviations,  the  results  of  the  program  were  promising:  (i)  during  FY2016,  the  economy \ngrew  by  4.7%,  above  the  global  growth  of  3.1%;  (ii)  inflation  was  0.8%,  well  below  the  IMF \ntarget of 4.0%; and (iii) the foreign reserves had more than doubled since June 2013.7 The IMF \nbelieves that as structural reforms take hold, bottlenecks will ease, growth will  accelerate, and \nvulnerabilities will recede. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of Water  and  Power  (MOWP).  2013.

IMF  Country  Report.  No.  16/325.  Washington,  DC. \nhttps://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=44327.0. As of the end of FY2016,  Pakistan\u2019s gross public \ndebt  stood  at  66.5%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  while  its  net  public  debt  was  60.2%  of  GDP.  Under  the \nFiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act, 2005 (as amended), the government must reduce public debt to 60% \nof  estimated  GDP  by  FY2018,  and  progressively  reduce  public  debt  to  50%  of  GDP  during  a  15-year  transition \nperiod. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nEnergy  data  also  demonstrate  the  positive  results  of  the  reforms:  (i)  load  shedding  in \n4. \nurban areas was reduced from 12 hours in FY2013 to 6 hours in FY2015; (ii) electricity losses \nwere  reduced,  while  collections  increased;  and  (iii)  better  fuel  management  helped  cut  power \ngeneration costs. However, Pakistan\u2019s electricity generation capacity is about 5,500 megawatts \nshort,  and  the  inadequate  energy  supply  has  been  a  constraint  to  the  economy. Further,  only \ntwo-thirds  of  the  population  have  access  to  power. 8  Despite  the  improvements,  persistent \nblackouts and brownouts negatively affect investor confidence and economic growth. \n \nResolving  energy  problems  require  massive  investments  that  cannot  be  accomplished \n5. \nsolely by the state, even with assistance from development partners. The financing gap can only \nbe  closed  by  improving  self-financing  capacity  and  by  attracting  private  investments  globally. \nSector reforms are crucial for enhancing the business environment for long-term investments. \n \n6. \nSince the 1990s, Pakistan has taken steps to restructure and improve its energy sector, \nbut  the  results  have  been  mixed  and  the  expected  outcomes  were  not  always  achieved. \nPrevious  reforms  led  to  the  unbundling  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  into \n15 corporatized  entities:  nine  regional  power  distribution  companies  (DISCOs),  four  thermal \npower  generation  companies  (GENCOs),  the  National  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company \n(NTDC),  and  the Water and Power  Development  Authority.  Central  Power  Purchasing Agency \nGuarantee Limited (CPPA-G), the country\u2019s sole buyer and seller of electricity, used to be a unit \nwithin NTDC but became an independent corporate entity in 2015. The government fully owns \nall  these  companies  except  for  the  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company,  which  was  privatized  in \n2005. Independent power producers generate 56% of the country\u2019s power. The National Electric \nPower  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA),  established  in  1997,  sets  tariffs,  issues  licenses,  and \nregulates the sector. \n \n7. \nIn  2013,  the  government  settled  PRs480  billion  in  electricity  payment  arrears  (circular \ndebt).9 Since that time, arrears have accumulated at a slower pace, reaching PRs321 billion by \nthe  end  of  FY2016,  slightly  above  the  target  set  in  subprogram  2. 10 Major  causes  of  this \ncontinued  accumulation  include  (i)  the  ambiguity  in  legislation,  which  has  blocked  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  introduce  surcharges  and  other  policy  decisions  to  boost  the  sector\u2019s \nfinancial  sustainability;  and  (ii)  delays  in  the  privatization  of  the  DISCOs.  In  addition,  various \nentities are challenging over 1,300 of NEPRA\u2019s decisions, including those related to surcharges, \nin court. Since an average case has a 7-year life span, court challenges add uncertainty to the \ninvestment  climate.  Public  disclosure  of  the  sector\u2019s  operational  and  financial  information  has \nimproved, but misinterpretation of sector data is often used for political purposes. \n \n8. \nThe  government  is  expecting  significant  investments  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector.  The \nChina\u2013Pakistan  Economic  Corridor  initiative  has  attracted  $33  billion  in  investments  through \n2022, primarily for electricity generation and transmission.11 Of this amount, about 80% is from \nprivate  investors.  Decisive  reforms  are  needed to  (i) further  reduce the gap  between end-user \nand  cost-recovery  tariffs,12 (ii)  streamline  the  sector\u2019s  legal  and  regulatory  environment;  and \n(iii) institutionalize information disclosure. \n\n                                                \n8  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). 2016.

Energy Priority Projects. http://cpec.gov.pk/energy. \n12 The  gap  between  end-user  and  cost-recovery  tariffs  is  the  difference  between  (i)  cost-recovery  and  NEPRA-\ndetermined  tariffs;  and  (ii)  NEPRA-determined  and  government-notified  tariffs,  which  are  balanced  through \nsubsidies. \n\n\f3 \n\nTariff  and  subsidies.  A  primary  goal  of  the  program  is  to  improve  the  financial \n9. \nsustainability  of  the  energy  sector.  Electricity  subsidies  introduced  by  previous  governments \nsurged  to  1.8%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  FY2013.  A  time  lag  in  determining  tariffs \ndelayed  the  reflection  of  current  costs  in  electricity  prices.  These  factors,  combined  with \nlegislative  constraints  that  prevent  policy  actions  from  recognizing  higher  losses  and  lower \ncollections  in  areas  with  security  concerns,  have  led  to  insufficient  financial  resources  to  fully \npay for electricity and fuel supply, exacerbating the circular debt problem. \n \nThe  program  is  intended  to  help  the government  remove  these financial constraints. In \n10. \n2014,  the  Economic  Coordination  Committee  (ECC)  approved  the  National  Power  Tariff  and \nSubsidy Policy Guidelines, which eliminated subsidies for industrial, commercial, and residential \nconsumers that use more than 300 kilowatt-hours per month. As a result, subsidies decreased \nto  0.8%  of  GDP  in  FY2015  and  0.7%  in  FY2016;  a  further  decrease  to  0.4%  of  GDP  is \nenvisaged  for  FY2017.  The  subsidies  were  focused  to  benefit  the  poor  and  the  middle  class, \nand  further  cuts  are  subject  to  the  social  considerations.  Under  the  previous  subprograms, \nNEPRA approved multiyear tariff guidelines and all DISCOs submitted 5-year investment plans, \nwhich is the first step under the multiyear tariff mechanism to reduce the overall time required \nfor tariff determinations. The first multiyear tariffs were determined in subprogram 3 (para. 24). \n \n11. \nIn October 2014, the government introduced surcharges to service the debt obligations \nassumed  by  Power  Holding  Company  Limited  (PHCL) 13  as  part  of  a  previous  effort  by  the \ngovernment  to  clear  accumulated  circular  debt.  These  surcharges  were  stayed  by  the  Lahore \nHigh  Court  because  of  ambiguity  in  legislation.  In  June  2015,  the  Supreme  Court  allowed  the \nreinstatement  of  the  surcharges  until  a  final  decision  is  issued.  The  legislative  changes  under \nsubprogram 3 eliminate the ambiguity in the law and therefore ensure that the government can \nsecure revenue sources for the sector by imposing surcharges when required (para. 23). \n \nSector performance and private sector participation. Government initiatives requiring \n12. \ntargets  under \nDISCOs \nperformance-based contracts resulted in an increase in electricity bill collections from 86.0% in \nFY2013  to  94.4%  in  FY2016,  and  a  reduction  of  losses  from  21.9%  to  17.8%  in  the  same \nperiod. Further improvements can be achieved through investments that are supported by ADB \nand other development partners.14 A key achievement under the previous subprograms was to \nseparate the commercial settlement functions of the Central Power Purchasing Agency from the \nNTDC, the grid\u2019s technical operator. The CPPA-G buys electricity on behalf of DISCOs, but it is \nenvisaged  to  expand  into  Pakistan\u2019s  wholesale  electricity  market.  Further  operationalization  of \nthe  CPPA-G  was  supported  under  subprogram  3  through  NEPRA\u2019s  approval  of  a  market \noperator fee for CPPA-G activities (paras. 25 and 27).15 \n \n13. \ndeveloped  energy-efficiency  guidelines  and \n\nEnergy-efficiency awareness in Pakistan is low. Through subprogram 2, the government \ntypes  of \nlabels \n\nto  protect  revenues  and  commit \n\nthree  energy-intensive \n\nto  operational  and \n\nfinancial \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n13 The government created the PHCL in 2009 to issue indebtedness that was used to pay off the debt accumulated \nby DISCOs, GENCOs, the NTDC, and other energy sector entities. In 2009, PRs226 billion was transferred from \nthese entities to the PHCL. In 2015, PHCL\u2019s debt increased to PRs335 billion and has since remained unchanged. \n14 ADB.  2015.

Subprogram  3  further  institutionalized  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  by \npassing legislation that promotes energy efficiency and conservation (para. 26). \n \n14. \nBecause of civil unrest, the government suspended ambitious plans to privatize DISCOs \nand GENCOs through strategic sales. However, under subprogram 3, the government took an \nalternative  approach  to  improving  efficiency  in  electricity  enterprises  by  initiating  steps  toward \nthe public offering of minority interest in three DISCOs (para. 25). \n \nThe program supports the government\u2019s initiative to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on \n15. \nimported fuel through the development of the domestic gas subsector. The greater use of fuel \nthrough  economic  growth  has  resulted  in  increased  imports  and  balance-of-payment  issues, \nwhich  constrains  further  growth.  Reforms  in  the  electricity  and  gas  subsectors  are  crucial  in \nresolving  the  link  between  growth  and  fuel  imports.  Subprograms  1  and  2  supported  the \nimplementation  of  the  Petroleum  Exploration  and  Production  Policy,  2012  by  introducing \ncompetitive  gas  pricing  for  existing  and  new  gas  concessions. 16 Subprogram  3  initiated  the \ncorporate restructuring of the state gas subsector and the regulatory environment to respond to \nmarket needs (para. 28). \n \n16. \nAccountability  and transparency. Before the program, the state-owned power utilities \ndid  not  systematically  share  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  information  with  the  public  or  other \nstakeholders. However, through previous subprograms, (i) the NTDC created web-based open \naccess  to  operational  information;  (ii)  DISCOs  began  publishing  monthly  billing  and  collection \ndata;  (iii) NEPRA  has  been  analyzing  and  publishing  the  performance  of  DISCOs  since  2011; \nand  (iv) the  CPPA-G  publishes  on  its  website  the  amounts  due  and  payments  made  by  each \nDISCO to the CPPA-G, and by the CPPA-G to each generator, including arrears. These steps \ncontributed to greater participation of the stakeholders in restructuring the sector. Transparency \nwas further enhanced under subprogram 3 by (i) providing training to the media to improve its \nunderstanding  of  the  operational  and  financial  information  disclosed  by  the  sector  operators, \nand (ii) publishing the results of NEPRA\u2019s monitoring reviews of these operators (para. 29). \n \n17. \nDevelopment coordination. Subprogram 3 was prepared in coordination with the AFD, \nthe  IMF,  JICA,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  to  increase  the  program\u2019s \noverall  economic  impact  in  Pakistan.  The  development  partners  coordinated  closely  on  the \nproposed  amendments  to  the  Regulation  of  Generation,  Transmission  and  Distribution  of \nElectric Power Act, 1997, commonly known as the NEPRA Act, to ensure that they reflect best \npractices for oversight and regulation of energy sector operations. \n \nLessons.

The program aligns with the priorities of ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  2015\u20132019,  which  emphasizes  policy  reforms  and \nstructural  transformation  in  the  energy  sector  to  remove  the  barriers  to  economic  growth, \nstimulate job creation, and improve macroeconomic and political sustainability.21 The program is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for  Pakistan.22 Reform  policy \nactions  will  contribute  to  knowledge-related  issues,  which  align  with  the  midterm  review  of \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020. 23  Taking  a  holistic  approach  to  the  sector,  ADB  will  continue  policy \ndialogue  through  project  interventions  and  may  consider  further  policy-based  lending  with  the \ngovernment after the general elections. \n \nB. \n \n20. \nThe  impact  of  the  overall  program  will  be  a  more  reliable,  sustainable,  and  secure \nenergy  sector  that  supports  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved \nreliability, sustainability, and affordability of the energy system. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nAll fourteen policy conditions for subprogram 3 were attained in the period from January \n2016  till  May  2017.  The  dynamics  of  the  reform  program  required  the  revision  of  some  policy \nactions. 24  The  entire  program  was  originally  designed  to  support  the  government\u2019s  reform \ninitiatives  through  five  annual  subprograms  corresponding  with  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  year, \ncommencing  from  FY2014.  However,  as  it  will  likely  not  be  feasible  to  pursue  additional \nsignificant policy reforms until after the general elections scheduled for mid-2018, subprogram 3 \nis  planned  as  the  last  for  this  program.  Overall,  the  program  achieved  a  broader  range  of \nreforms than initially planned and, as of the end of subprogram 3, most of the result indicators \nfor the entire program, as specified in the policy matrix, had been achieved or partially achieved. \n25 Subprogram 3 delivered three outputs. \n \nOutput  1:  Tariffs  and  subsidies  managed.  The  main  objective  of  this  output  was  to \n22. \npropose legislative changes that will allow the government to address the financial sustainability \nissues of the sector. On 2 May 2017 the Council of Common Interests approved amendments to \none  of  the  fundamental  laws  of  the  energy  sector,  the  NEPRA  Act,  and  submitted  them  to \nParliament  for  consideration.  This  major  additional  achievement  of  the  program  (i)  clearly \ndefined the roles of and the functional separation between the government as the policy maker \nand  NEPRA  as  the  sector  regulator,  (ii)  improved  the  decision-making  process  and \naccountability  of  the  government  as  a  policy  maker  and  NEPRA  as  a  sector  regulator,  (iii) \nclarified the definition and applicability of surcharges, and (iv) established the foundation for the \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nProgram.

Details of the results indicators under subprograms 1\u20133 are in the planned and \n\nactual results indicators of the policy matrix in Appendix 4, Table A4.2. \n\n \n\n\fdevelopment  of  a  competitive  electricity  market.26 The  amendments  to  the  NEPRA  Act  would \nbetter align the operations of the  electricity regulatory framework of Pakistan  with international \nbest practices, which is crucial to attracting private investments. \n \nApproval of the NEPRA Act amendments will enable the government to update the 2015 \n23. \ncircular debt management plan, which placed clearance of the stock of the debt entirely on the \nproceeds  generated  by  the  proposed  strategic  sale  of  electricity  enterprises  to  the  private \nsector.  After  parliamentary  ratification,  these  amendments,  taken  together  with  the  sale  of \nminority stakes in certain DISCOs through public offerings, will allow the government to reduce \nthe flow and stock of the debt, which stood at PRs374 billion at the end of December 2016. The \nupdated plan has different scenarios to manage circular debt. Application of surcharges starting \nfrom  2019  are  expected  to reduce the stock  to PRs240 billion  by  the  end  of  FY2021,  and  the \ncombination  of  full  cost-recovery  tariff  and  surcharges  could  bring  it  down  to  PRs65 billion  by \nthe end of FY2021. The amended act will also allow the government to impose surcharges for \nenvironmental  protection,  energy  efficiency,  demand  management,  climate  change \nmanagement, and energy supply security. \n \n24. \nIn 2016, NEPRA issued determinations on multiyear tariffs for three DISCOs and annual \ntariffs  for  all  remaining  DISCOs.  However,  as  with  other  tariff  determinations,  eight  DISCOs \nchallenged  the  determinations  in  court  (para.  7).  Following  a  practice  of  other  jurisdictions \naround the world, the proposed NEPRA Act amendments would introduce an appellate tribunal \nto  deal  with  the  issue.  The  tribunal  would  be  subject  to  strict  deadlines  to  review  appeals  of \nNEPRA\u2019s  decisions  and,  if  found  to  have  merit,  would  return  the  case  to  NEPRA  for  further \naction  consistent  with  the  decision.  NEPRA,  in  turn,  would  be  bound  by  strict  timelines  to \nreconsider  its  decisions.  The  time-bound  mechanism  aims  to  substantially  reduce  the \nprocessing time of future appeals. \n \n25. \nOutput  2:  Sector  performance  and  market  access  for  private  sector  participation \nimproved.  The  change  to  the  electricity  structure  supported  under  subprogram  2  required \nrevisions  to  the  security  package  offered  to  new  investors  in  the  electricity  subsector  and  a \nnovation  of  the  existing  commercial  agreements.  The  government  bifurcated  nine  power \npurchase agreements and transferred commercial responsibilities from the NTDC to the CPPA-\nG.27 On 28 April 2017, the ECC approved and published the new security package. In addition, \nthe  government  merged  the Alternative  Energy  Development  Board and the  Private  Power \nInfrastructure  Board,  both  established  to  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  electricity \nsubsector but for different scales and types of energy, for operational efficiency purposes.28 The \ngovernment  was  planning  to  improve  operational  efficiency  of  the  DISCOs  through  strategic \nsale, however, the original privatization plan required a revision as a result of public resistance. \nForced  as  an  alternative  solution,  in  2016  the  Cabinet  Committee  on  Privatization  approved \ninitiating the steps toward a public offering of a minority interest in three DISCOs. \n \n26. \nEfficiency is pursued by the government in other areas as well. Based on the foundation \ncreated  by  previous  subprograms,  the government  passed the  National  Energy  Efficiency  and \nConservation Act into law in July 2016. The act established the National Energy Efficiency and \nConservation  Authority,  which  develops  mandatory  energy-efficiency  labels  and  recommends \nstandards,  carries  out  energy  audits;  prohibits  the  manufacture,  sale,  or  import  of  equipment \nthat is not energy efficient; and imposes fines for using energy-intensive appliances. \n\n                                                \n26 NEPRA Act amendments were submitted for parliamentary ratification in May 2017. \n27 The remaining agreements will be gradually novated as permits and licenses expire. \n28 The federal government approved the amendments to the Private Power Investment Board Act, 2012 on 27 April \n\nand submitted them for parliamentary ratification on 19 May 2017. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nAnticipating the increase in electricity participants and the development of a competitive \n27. \npower  market,  NEPRA  established  the  Electricity  Sector  Market  Operations  Unit  in  July  2016 \nand approved a market operator fee for the CPPA-G in January 2017. Separately, in response \nto demand, NEPRA developed transmission tariff guidelines that were published in April 2017. \n \n28. \nAfter the successful application of the Petroleum Policy, 2012 in subprograms 1 and 2, \nthe  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources  (MPNR)  directed  its  attention  to  the  gas \nsubsector.  On  9  September  2016,  the  MPNR  adopted  a  mid-  and  downstream  gas  subsector \nrestructuring plan, which was prepared with World Bank support. As a first stage, the MPNR has \ncompleted  the  operational  and  accounting  unbundling  of  the  transmission  and  distribution \nbusinesses  of  Sui  Northern  and  Sui  Southern companies.  Legal  unbundling  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by the end of FY2018. To ensure the adequacy of the new structure, on 11 August \n2016, the MPNR initiated a review of the roles and responsibilities of upstream and downstream \nregulatory agencies. \n \n29. \nOutput  3:  Accountability  and  transparency  in  power  subsector  achieved.  During \nFY2016  and  part  of  FY2017,  NEPRA  published  performance  evaluation  reports  on  public \nGENCOs,  DISCOs,  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company,  and  NTDC  compliance  with  license \nprovisions. However, energy sector data is complex and often misunderstood by media. In May \n2017,  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MOWP),  together  with  other  sector  stakeholders, \nconducted  the  first  media  training  on  how  to  use  and  interpret  sector  data  disclosed  on  the \nwebsites of the NTDC, the CPPA-G, DISCOs, and the ministry itself. Media training of this type \nis expected to become a regular activity. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nloan  of \nSDR257,443,000  ($400  million  equivalent)  in  April  2014.  ADB  approved  and  disbursed  two \nloans  in  December  2015  under  subprogram  2:  (i)  a  loan  of  SDR213,543,000  ($300  million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources.  These  loans were  used  to fund  the government\u2019s  budgetary  needs \nfor  FY2014  and  FY2016.  The  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4)  lists  actions  taken  prior  to  Board \nconsideration  for  subprograms  1\u20133.  The  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of \n$300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 3.29 The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  Based  on  the  custom  amortization  method,  the  average  maturity  is  10.45 \nyears,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  The  AFD  will  provide  collaborative \ncofinancing for subprogram 3 in the form of a loan in the amount of \u20ac100 million. The AFD loan \nwill have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; and an annual interest rate based \non the 6-month euro LIBOR plus 55 basis points (floating), with an appraisal fee of 0.25% and \nno  commitment  charges.  The  programmatic  approach  will  support  reforms  outlined  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n31. \nThe subprogram 3 loan is for general budget support and does not finance any specific \nbudget  item.  The  amount  of  the  loan  for  subprogram  3  was  determined  based  on  the \n\nADB  approved  and  disbursed  subprogram  1  as  a  single-tranche \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n                                                \n29 The initial amount of subprogram 3 as contemplated in subprogram 1 (ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic Approach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram \n1 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program. Manila) was $150 million. \nThe increase in the loan amount is justified by the additional accomplishments of the reform program (footnote 24). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\ngovernment\u2019s  financing  needs  until  the  results  of  the  reforms  are  fully  realized.  The \ngovernment\u2019s internal procedures will require about 6 months before legislative changes in the \nNEPRA Act are reflected in the notified tariffs. Meanwhile, the government will have to support \nthe  cost  of  excess  losses  and  lower  collections,  which  for  the  6  months  are  estimated  at \nPRs55 billion. Total ADB financing and cofinancing under subprogram 3 is PRs42.6 billion. \n \nE. \n \nThe ECC is the final government authority on the reforms. The Ministry of Finance is the \n32. \nprogram\u2019s  executing  agency,  supported  by  a  program  coordination  unit  (PCU).  The  PCU  has \noverall responsibility for coordinating program monitoring and reporting. The MPNR and MOWP \nare the implementing agencies, supported by their monitoring units established under previous \nsubprograms.  Each  monitoring  unit  is  responsible  for  program  reporting  and  discussing \nimplementation issues with the PCU. The monitoring units submit reports to the ECC, which are \nalso  provided  to  ADB  and  cofinanciers.30 The  technical  assistance  to  support  the  program  is \nprovided  by  ADB,  JICA,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  World \nBank, and other development partners through their ongoing and new initiatives. The proceeds \nof the policy-based loan will be withdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, \nas amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  proposed  policy  reforms  under  the  program  will  support  economic  growth  through \n33. \nincreased energy investments by tapping private funding sources, which will be achieved by the \nprogram\u2019s outputs and outcome. \n \nCircular  debt  is  the  major  financial  issue  in  the  power  subsector.  As  of  the  end  of \n34. \nDecember  2016, payables to power  producers  and fuel  suppliers  amounted to  PRs374  billion. \nThis  represents  an  increase  of  about  80%  from  the  end  of  FY2013  after  the  PRs480  billion \nclearance.  Despite  improvements  in  the  subsector\u2019s  performance,  the  remaining  losses  and \ncollection  issues,  and  the  gap  between  NEPRA-determined  tariffs  and  actual  cost-recovery \nlevels  continue  to  hamper  DISCOs\u2019  ability  to  make  full  power  purchase  payments.  In  the  first \nquarter of FY2017, the reflection of higher capacity charges from a settlement of royalty issues \nwith  provincial  governments  contributed  to  a  rapid  increase  in  generation  costs  and  circular \ndebt. As the subsector suffers from a chronic shortage of funds, it remains vulnerable to these \nunplanned  events.  A  sound  regulatory  framework  that  allows  for  full  cost-recovery  tariffs,  a \ndispute  settlement  mechanism,  and  surcharges  when  required,  which  the  NEPRA  Act \namendment  tries  to  establish,  will  be  key  to  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  subsector \n(para. 23). \n \n35. \nThe government has successfully reduced the amount of electricity subsidies during the \nprogram,  which overlapped  with the IMF program  period.  Electricity  subsidies in FY2016  were \nPRs171 billion, significantly less than PRs292 billion in FY2014 and PRs221 billion in FY2015.31 \nThe  key  factor  in  controlling  the  amount  of  electricity  subsidies  was  the  introduction  of  tariff \nrationalization surcharges as a cross-subsidy mechanism in different parts of the country. With \nthe  surcharges  in  place,  the  government  estimates  FY2017  electricity  subsidies  to  be \n\n                                                \n30 Technical Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2015. Federal Budget 2015\u201316: Budget in Brief. Islamabad. \n\n\f9 \n\nGovernance \n\nIn  September  2016,  Pakistan  became  signatory \n\nPRs118 billion, or about 0.4% of GDP. Clarity on the government\u2019s power to introduce required \nsurcharges through NEPRA Act amendments therefore plays a key role in managing subsidies. \n \nB. \n \nIn line  with  its  Second Governance  and Anticorruption  Action  Plan,32 ADB  conducted  a \n36. \ngovernance,  institutional,  and  corruption  risk  assessment  in  2015  as part  of the  preparation of \nthe  country  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan.  In  the  assessment,  Pakistan\u2019s  score  for  various \ngovernance indicators fell below the regional average in 2012. However, the country has made \nprogress  in  improving  accountability,  increasing  transparency,  and  raising  efficiency.  The \ngovernment  has  embarked  on  several  reforms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  framework, \nincluding budget management, financial accounting, and reporting and expenditure controls. As \npart  of  the  IMF  extended  fund  facility,  the  government  has  changed  its  tax  policy  to  increase \ntransparency. \nto  OECD\u2019s  Multilateral \nConvention  on  Mutual  Administrative  Assistance  in  Tax  Matters,  which  aims  to  tackle  tax \nevasion and avoidance through adoption of international best practices. Overall improvement in \nthe  governance  system  resulted  in  the  improved  credit  rating  of  Pakistan.33 Since  2014  focus \nhas  been  on  capacity  building  and  training  at  the federal  and provincial  levels.  A fiduciary risk \nassessment found that overall fiduciary risk at the federal level remains medium to high despite \nprogress  observed  in  individual  areas  about  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment. Internal control and audit requires improvements, as does the legislative oversight \nof budget formulation and execution. Although the institutional setup for public procurement has \nbeen  established,  the government  has  to  make additional  efforts  to augment  the  capacity  and \nbudgets  of  the  procurement  authorities.  To  support  the  government\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement  reforms,  initiatives  financed  by  various  development  partners  should  be \ncoordinated and complementary. \n \n37. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  government  is  acting  against  corruption,  which  includes  monitoring \nand reporting work by the public accounts committee of Parliament. \n \nC. \n \n38. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  will  accelerate  economic  growth  and  help \ncreate jobs, which are key to reducing poverty. Reliable power will benefit poor and vulnerable \nconsumers,  including  hospitals  and  schools,  which  are  hit  hard  by  inadequate  power  supply, \nload shedding, and poor power quality. Small industries will be able to operate for more hours \nper day and thereby increase productivity, which in turn will create more work opportunities for \nthe  poor.  Increases  in  the  Human  Development  Index  are  strongly  correlated  with  access  to \ncommercial electricity supplies. The indirect benefits of a reliable energy supply include reduced \nwork  time  and  improved  health  of  household  members  through  a  reduction  of  fume-related \nindoor pollution, and water- and food-borne diseases through refrigeration and boiling of water \nand food. \n \nD. \n \n39. \nThe  subprogram  has  been  assessed  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.

The  government  requested \nADB  to  finance  a  new  SCADA  project  (supported \nby  MFF  PAK:48078  Transmission  Enhancement \nInvestment Program, Tranche 2). This policy action \ncan be implemented after completion of the SCADA \nproject.  This  will  be  put  in  as  condition  for  further \ntranches in the MFF. \n \nMeanwhile  the  regulators  approved  Transmission \nTariff Guidelines\u2014a prerequisite for approval of the \nprivately financed transmission projects.  \n\nMarket rules approved under subprogram 2 already \nallow  direct  contracts.  However,  the  government \ntook additional actions to operationalize CPPA-G. \n\nPrivatization  program  through  strategic  sale  was \napproved under subprogram 2. However, due to the \npolitical  tensions  the  original  privatization  program \nwas  suspended.
