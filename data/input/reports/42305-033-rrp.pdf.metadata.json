I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased  loan  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Third  Financial  Sector \nProgram.1 \n \n2.   The development framework for Cambodia\u2019s finance sector is based on the government's \n10-year rolling Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS). The strategy was last updated for \n2011\u20132020.2 Reforms under the FSDS have been fully discussed with all relevant government \nagencies, industry associations, and development partners. The FSDS has also incorporated \nrecommendations of the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) of the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) meets regularly with \nall  development  partners  in  the finance sector  to  discuss  current  issues,  and  development \npartners\u2019 coordination was further strengthened during the update of the FSDS for 2011\u20132020. \nComprising three single-tranche subprograms, the third program to support the first phase of the \nFSDS for 2011-2020 will be completed at the conclusion of subprogram 3, following successful \ncompletion of subprograms 1 (footnote 1) and 2.3  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Cambodia has enjoyed robust economic growth and was one of the world\u2019s fastest-\ngrowing economies in the first decade of this century\u2014its real domestic gross product grew at an \nannual average of 9.1% between 1998 and 2008. Indirect impacts of the global economic crisis \nled to a slowdown in 2009 and 2010, but the recovery has been relatively quick and stable, even \novercoming the negative impact of the floods in 2011 and 2013. Economic growth has been \nachieved  under  macroeconomic  stability  and  prudent  fiscal  policies.  Cambodia  also  made \nsignificant  progress  in  poverty  reduction  and  became  one  of  the  top  five  countries  in  the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. On the other hand, the country\u2019s economy has \nbeen characterized as being reliant on a narrow economic base, mostly garments and tourism in \nterms of foreign exchange earnings. Fiscal space is also limited due to low fiscal revenues and \ninsufficient capacity for revenue mobilization, which remains a major constraint to meeting the \ndevelopment priorities of the country. While the expanding manufacturing and service sectors \ncould make the country\u2019s economy more inclusive and resilient to external shocks, a robust \nmarket-based finance sector is needed to support the growing economy. Greater connectivity \nand competition within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic community will be \nanother challenge for Cambodia. \n \n4.  Cambodia\u2019s finance sector is highly dollarized  and fragmented.  Under the dollarized \neconomy, the central bank has only limited measures to implement its monetary policies and \nmanage inflation. It also has limited ability to provide liquidity as \u201clender of last resort.\u201d The \nfinance sector has been growing significantly, although from a small base. The banking industry \nstill  dominates  the  finance  sector,  accounting  for  more  than  90%  of  assets  in  the  sector. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach, Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for \nthe Third Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 2815-CAM and TA 7934-CAM). \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA). ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of \nCambodia for Preparing the Third Financial Sector Program Cluster. Manila (TA 7520-CAM). \n3  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nfor Subprogram 2 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Third Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 3002-CAM). ", "2 \nMoreover, the banking industry itself is both concentrated and fragmented between urban and \nrural areas. The nonbanking segment and capital markets are at an early stage of development \nand do not yet have significant macroeconomic impact. Cambodia is now leaving the post-\nconflict era and faces the dual challenge of ensuring further development of the finance sector to \nsupport sustainable economic growth while striving for monetary policy independence. \n \n5.  The FSDS for 2011\u20132020 is aligned with Cambodia\u2019s updated National Strategy and \nDevelopment Plan (NSDP) for 2009\u20132013 and its Rectangular Strategy on Growth, Employment, \nEquity, and Efficiency, as well as with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for Cambodia, \n2011\u20132013.4The government launched the 2009\u20132013 update of the NSDP in mid-2010, with \n \nthe overarching objective of reducing poverty to 19.5% by 2015. The policy priorities of the \nNSDP  update  intersect  closely  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  especially  in  the  core  areas  of \ninfrastructure, education, and finance.5 The CPS for 2011\u20132013 has singled out the finance \nsector  as  one  of  five  priority  sectors.  The  finance  sector  assessment  in  the  strategy  also \nidentified the lack of public confidence in the overall financial system as a key constraint to the \ndevelopment of Cambodia\u2019s finance sector. \n \n6.  ADB has been the leading development partner of the finance sector in Cambodia since \n1999. A comprehensive approach was required to rebuild the financial system in a devastated \neconomy that had no finance sector. Responding to the government\u2019s needs, the approach has \nbeen broadly based so far. After successfully rebuilding the basic foundation of the banking \nindustry under the first and second programs,6 the third program has begun to support the \nsector\u2019s  expansion  to  cover  the  important  subsectors  of  nonbanking  services  and  capital \nmarkets, and to boost investors\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 confidence in the system with a stronger legal \nand regulatory framework,  necessary infrastructure, and  better quality of services, including \nconsumer protection. \n \n7.  The  third  program  has  focused  on  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  all  sector \nstakeholders, including the various regulators. The scope has shifted from the establishment of \nregulatory frameworks to their effective implementation and oversight, and more transparency. \nProper financial infrastructure is required to meet rising market needs for more efficient and \ndiverse financial services, as is further development of the legal foundations to ensure smooth \ntransactions in the sector. These reforms require coordination within the government and careful \nsequencing, including dialogue with the private sector. The third program has been facilitating \ncloser coordination. \n \n8.  Past and ongoing efforts to build a more broad-based and resilient finance sector in \nCambodia have yielded several lessons. First, as the scope of the sector expands, the need for \nconsultation,  coordination,  and  consensus  building  between  government  ministries  and \nagencies, and with the private sector, increases. This will require time and strong leadership in \nplanning and executing policy measures. Second, finance sector development should be based \non a sequence of well-planned steps, where each step is supported by solid technical inputs. TA \nresources are essential in this regard and, given the limited availability of ADB funds, strong \ndonor coordination is essential. The third program experienced some positive outcomes of close \ndonor consultation, whereby completion of policy actions was made possible through timely \ntechnical inputs of other development partners. Also, some initiatives developed by ADB have \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Cambodia, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2008.

Third, a long-term engagement establishes \nunderstanding and trust, which is vital for any reform program to succeed but indispensable for \nthe finance  sector,  where  policy  actions  such as  those  relating  to  interest  rates  or foreign \nexchange may involve significant externalities. Implementation of the third program benefited \nfrom the strong relationship that ADB had built with government counterparts in over a decade of \nengagement in the sector, and the steps taken and progress made under subprogram 3 should \nbe viewed as the building blocks that will need to be assessed in a long-term perspective. \n \n9.  ADB will continue the policy dialogue with the government to maintain the momentum of \nthe  third  program  under  the  Post-Program  Partnership  Framework.  Also,  ADB\u2019s  technical \nassistance (TA) for implementing subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program has been \nextended to June 2015 to deal with the remaining issues (footnote 1). However, for the next \nround of support, ADB should concentrate on its areas of comparative advantage, in consultation \nwith other development partners and the government. A first dialogue with the government to this \nend has started in the process of formulating the CPS, sector assessment, and strategy and road \nmap with consideration to relevant ADB strategies on the finance sector development.7  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be a sound, market-oriented finance sector that supports the mobilization \nof financial resources. The outcome will be a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system.8 \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.   The  third  program  comprises  three  single-tranche  subprograms  that  were  to  be \nimplemented from December 2010 to December 2013. Because of the delay caused by the \ngeneral election in July 2013, the implementation period was extended to June 2014.  In terms of \npolicy actions,9 the government has requested minor modifications to 8 policy triggers and 2 \npolicy milestones. Among modified policy actions, one policy trigger and one policy milestone \nhave  now  been  incorporated  in  programs  of  other  development  partners  with  additional \nresources to support related capacity building. The program also includes an additional policy \ntrigger  involving  the  introduction  of  the  negotiable  certificate  deposit  program  to  improve \ncommercial banks\u2019 liquidity management. Subprogram 3 has 20 policy triggers and 11 policy \nmilestones. The four policy triggers are still on-going and are expected to be completed by \nDecember 2014. Further details are provided in Appendix 4. The proposed revisions do not \nmaterially affect the program\u2019s impact, outcome, and outputs. Subprogram 3 has four outputs:  \n(i) improved legal, regulatory, and institutional framework; (ii) improved financial infrastructure; \n(iii) strengthened finance sector governance; and (iv) enhanced finance sector efficiency. Key \nactivities for each output are described in paras. 12\u201329. \n \n                                                \n7 These strategies include the following: ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  Policy actions are policy triggers for the loan (noted in bold in the policy matrix in Appendix 4). Policy milestones, \nwhile important in achieving the objectives of the program, are not policy triggers for the loan. They are presented to \nshow the additional reforms implemented by the government. \n \n ", "4 \n1.  Improved Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework \n12.  Update and enhance the legal foundation for banks and microfinance institutions. \nUnder the Second Financial Sector Program,10 a comprehensive review of the Law on Banking \nand Financial Institutions (LBFI), conducted with ADB TA, raised issues relating to consumer \nprotection, bank secrecy provisions to support the development of a credit information-sharing \nsystem, administrative procedures for insolvent or distressed banks, and protection or immunity \nof bank regulators. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) wanted to incorporate other FSAP \n(para. 2) inputs into the LBFI  and the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the NBC during \nFSP III. The First Initiatives (a trust fund administered by the World Bank) provided additional \nsupport and enabled consultations on the two laws between the World Bank and government \nagencies. The consultation process further delayed the implementation of the required policy \nactions, so the NBC decided to expedite the process by covering the issues raised through \nregulations rather than amendments to the laws by December 2014. The NBC will continue to \nwork on the revision of the two laws to address current and emerging issues relating supervision \nas stipulated in the FSDS for 2011\u20132020.  \n \n13.  Strengthen bank supervision capacity and adopt measures to sustain financial \nstability. To coordinate finance sector supervision and to prepare for the event of financial crisis, \na  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  the  NBC,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance (MEF), and the Securities Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) was prepared \nwith TA provided by the World Bank that included workshops on and simulation of a financial \ncrisis. Following the consideration of the draft under subprogram 2, the MOU, which establishes \nprocedures for practical information exchange and coordination between (and accountability of) \ndomestic supervisors in a financial crisis, was signed in July 2014. It is a critical achievement \ngiven the highly dollarized economy of Cambodia. Also, NBC drafted a national strategy to \npromote the use of riels for inter-ministerial consultation. Further, based on the prakas11 on \ninternal control and corporate governance, the NBC has completed a corporate governance \nprofile of each licensed bank to be used for onsite inspection. \n \n14.  Strengthen prudential supervision and regulations of microfinance institutions. The \nNBC has been working to improve the quality of supervision of microfinance institutions (MFIs) \nunder subprograms 1 and 2. The Economist Intelligence Unit report on microfinance in 2013\n \nranked Cambodia fifth among 55 countries in the category of regulatory framework.12 Under \nsubprogram 3, the NBC completed an assessment of compliance with the Microfinance Activities \nand the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.13 Eight of the 29 principles are yet to \nbe complied with. They relate to the compatibility of the regulatory framework with the banking \nindustry and the risk management capacity of MFIs. Further work will pave the way for quality \nservices of MFIs and a more inclusive finance sector in Cambodia. \n \n15.  Enhance the legal foundation to support financial and commercial transactions. A \nstrong  legal  foundation  to  support  financial  and  commercial  activities  is  critical  for  sound \neconomic development in Cambodia. Subprogram 2 supported the upgrade of the financial legal \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2007.

Under \nsubprogram 3, a draft consumer protection law and a draft comprehensive trust law have been \nsubmitted to the Council of Ministers (COM), and the new Law on Insurance was cleared by the \nCOM and has been approved by the National Assembly. Initially, the trust law under subprogram \n3 was intended to cover only MFIs, but after consultation with stakeholders, the government \nrequested an expansion in scope to include broader economic activities and the supervision of \nleasing companies. ADB agreed and provided additional TA inputs for drafting a comprehensive \ntrust law. The secured transaction registry, an integral part of lending activities  to protect \ncollaterals, was strengthened under the Secured Transaction Law as part of the third program\u2019s \nactivities.  Effective  coordination  between  development  partners  prompted  the  International \nFinance Corporation to join efforts to support the government in further improving the registry. \n \n16.  Confidence in the finance sector improved under Output 1. These progressive steps, \nwhich help make the financial system more resilient to external shocks, were made possible by \nclose coordination between donors and efforts to increase the leverage of policy reforms. The \nrisk-weighted  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  banks  and  MFIs  has  been  maintained  above  20% \ncompared to the minimum ratio of 15%. Moreover, the trust scheme to protect the capital of MFIs, \nthe consumer protection scheme, and the improvement to the secured transaction registry all \ncontribute to building risk-mitigating measures and boosting confidence in the finance sector. \n \n2.  Improved Financial Infrastructure \n17.  Modernize the national payments, clearance, and settlement system. Continued from \nsubprogram 1, the National Clearing System was commissioned during subprogram 2 and the \nNBC held consultations with the banking industry to establish the shared switch system during \nsubprogram 3.14 The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) continued consultations with the NBC and the \nMinistry of Post and Telecommunications, on the drafting of the e-Commerce Law. The draft law \nis expected to be submitted to the COM by December 2014. \n \n18.  Enhance consumer access to credit, consumer protection, and market confidence. \nContinued from subprograms 1 and 2, a privately owned credit information bureau\u2014the Credit \nBureau Cambodia (CBC)\u2014was established in 2011 as a joint venture of the Association of \nBanks  in  Cambodia,  the  Cambodia  Microfinance  Association,  and  an  international  service \nprovider. It began operating in March 2012 during subprogram 2. The CBC\u2019s comprehensive \ncoverage  for  both  banking  and  MFIs  obtained  positive  feedback  on  addressing  the  over-\nindebtedness  issues.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  NBC  introduced  a  governance  structure  to \nmaintain confidentiality of data and a fee table acceptable to both the Association of Banks in \nCambodia and the Cambodia Microfinance Association. While working on strengthening the \ninstitutional framework, the NBC together with industry associations also carried out financial \nliteracy programs for the public, which attracted a majority of female participants. \n \n19.  Develop  the  interbank  and  government  securities  markets.  Commenced  under \nsubprogram  2,  MEF  continued  to  develop  market  procedures  for  Treasury  bills  under \nsubprogram  3.  However,  the  government\u2019s  debt  management  strategy  envisages  that  the \nissuance of government bonds would not take place until 2018. In September 2013, the NBC \nintroduced the negotiable certificate deposit program to improve banks\u2019 liquidity management; \nthis  was  an  additional  initiative  under  the  third  program  to  further  broaden  banks\u2019  risk \nmanagement options. \n                                                \n14 The system for sharing information on the transactions of clients including balance and payments. \n \n ", "6 \n20.  Develop domestic securities market. Under subprogram 3, SECC has submitted the \ndraft sub-decree on bankruptcy initially prepared during subprogram 2 to the COM and initiated \nan evaluation of the legal framework for new markets, including collective investment schemes, \ncredit rating agency, and securities borrowing and lending. Commenced during subprogram 2, \nSECC  also  concluded  a  self-assessment  on  compliance  with  the  core  principles  of  the \nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions as a preparatory step for future application \nfor membership. SECC established an in-house customer complaint center to deal with investor \nprotection issues and, to increase its own capacity, started giving financial support to its staff for \nattending the chartered financial analyst program. \n \n21.  Develop insurance industry. ADB and MEF agreed to cancel the actuarial study on life \ninsurance to develop a mortality table, because it was deemed premature in view of the nascent \ncharacter of the life insurance business, which only started in 2012. However, the accounting \nguidelines for the insurance sector were developed under ADB TA during subprogram 3, creating \nthe foundation for sound growth of this important subsector. \n \n22.  Financial infrastructure improved under Output 2. The growth of the banking system \nhas further advanced the shift from risky cash-based transactions to safe and more transparent \nones that require proper records. The National Clearing System is an essential infrastructure to \nsettle  an  increasing  number  of  check  payments  and  remittances,  as  well  as  \ne-payments. The number of checks cleared daily has reached 3,837 in 2013 compared to 2,195 \nin 2010 with more electronic payments and transfers transacted. The e-Commerce Law aims to \nlay the legal foundation for e-payments. The CBC, with its broad database, effectively solved the \nissue of over-lending to a single entity. The third program has been supporting the development \nof  the  bond  and  capital  markets.  It  is  expected  that  these  markets  will  open  investment \nopportunities for the nonbanking industry (insurance and pension) in the medium term. \n \n3.  Strengthened Finance Sector Governance \n23.  Promote  international  initiatives  on  anti-money  laundering  and  combating  the \nfinancing of terrorism. Cambodia has gained membership in the Asia Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering  and  is  committed  to  complying  with  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF) \nrecommendations, international conventions, and United Nations Security Council resolutions. \nCambodia is undergoing the FATF International Co-operation Review Group process and since \nJuly 2011 has been on the gray list of jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies in anti-money \nlaundering  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT),  but  high-level  political \ncommitment to rectifying the shortcomings through an action plan has been made. Cambodia \nissued a sub-decree on the establishment of a national AML/CFT coordination committee in April \n2012. During subprogram 2, the Cambodia Financial Intelligence Unit (CAFIU) undertook risk \nassessment of NBC supervised institutions. Under subprogram 3, the Prime Minister has granted \napproval to implement the national risk assessment recommended by FATF, and authorized \nCAFIU to coordinate it with all relevant ministries and agencies. CAFIU prepared a strategic \nimplementation plan for the national risk assessment, which it submitted to the CAFIU board \nunder subprogram 3. \n \n24.  Enhance  corporate  governance  and  transparency  in  the  finance  sector.  Under \nsubprogram 2, SECC started to promote the use of the code of corporate governance for listed \ncompanies and conducted an educational campaign with emphasis on responsibilities of the \nboard of directors, corporate secretaries, and management. Under subprogram 3, the coverage \nwas expanded to non-listed companies. NBC started to collect the gender-segregated data on a \nregular basis. \n ", "7 \n25.  Establish commercial dispute resolution mechanism. Under subprogram 2, MOC had \nundertaken to establish the National Arbitration Center (NAC) with the joint support of ADB and \nInternational Finance Corporation. NAC\u2019s first general assembly for the election of the first board \nof directors was held in January 2013, and the directors, including representatives from the \nprivate sector, were duly appointed. Subprogram 3 helped the recruitment and training of new \narbitrators  and  finalized  the  business  plan  for  NAC  to  ensure  its  operational  and  financial \nsustainability. MOC cemented its commitment to NAC by granting it office space. NAC was duly \noperationalized at the first board of directors\u2019 meeting in July 2014. \n \n26.  Improve  accounting  and  auditing  profession.  Although  the  draft  Accounting  and \nAuditing Law had been submitted to the COM under subprogram 2, it was returned to MEF \nbecause of a deficiency relating to sanctions. The draft law is expected to be resubmitted to the \nCOM  by  December  2014.  Financial  support  for  a  new  university  curriculum  based  on \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards and for an existing scholarship program continues to \nbuild the number of local qualified accountants. \n \n27.  Governance and transparency strengthened under Output 3. Good governance has \nbeen a priority throughout, and the third program in particular has supported the government\u2019s \ncommitments to the international community. This will improve the finance sector\u2019s reputation \nand the international community\u2019s confidence in the country. The audited financial statements of \nfinancial institutions are publicly disclosed. The support for AML/CFT is expected to contribute to \nCambodia\u2019s  removal from  the  FATF gray  list. The  promotion  of  corporate governance  and \nadoption of internationally recognized financial reporting standards will further assure investors. \nThe establishment of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism outside the courts confirms \nCambodia\u2019s commitment to the World Trade Organization membership. \n \n4.  Enhanced Finance Sector Efficiency \n28.  Modernize the business registration system. Based on the assessment conducted \nunder  subprogram  1,  it  concluded  that  MOC\u2019s  corporate  registration  system  needs  to  be \nconsolidated and upgraded to improve the national database of corporate entities and make \ncorporate information more accessible to stakeholders in the financial market, be it investors, \nlenders, or the general public. This will reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency. Under \nsubprogram 3 and with TA from ADB, an adequate budget was provided and the consolidation \nprocess commenced. The World Bank approached MOC and agreed to continue the initiative \nwith support from the Trade Swap Fund (a trust fund administered by the World Bank). This is \nexpected to be a more comprehensive endeavor. \n \n29.  Efficiency  enhanced  under  Output  4.  The  company  registration  system  and  its \ncorporate data are a prerequisite for lenders and investors to conduct initial credit evaluations. \nWithout provision of affordable and reliable data, the evaluation process is lengthier and costlier. \nOnce a proper and efficient system is established, the lending rates of financial institutions \nreflecting reduced transaction costs will be more affordable and economy of scale in term of fees \ncharged will come from an expanding small and medium enterprise sector.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n30.  The third program, with its three subprograms, requires a total of $45 million equivalent \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources. The size of the budget support program depends on (i) the \nfinancing needs for sector development as identified during country programming and strategy \nformulation; (ii) the importance the government attaches to the reform program; and (iii) the \n ", "8 \nestimated costs of designing and implementing the medium-term reform program minus the \nestimated financial support from other development partners.15 This estimate includes costs that \nmust be absorbed by the government to support the growing finance sector. For example, growth \nin quantity (number of financial institutions) and quality (need for more sophisticated supervision) \nrequires greater government capacity in terms of well-qualified staff, proper institutional settings, \nand  system  support.  The  estimate  also  includes  system  development  and  upgrades  of \nparticipating agencies and self-regulatory organizations16 to ensure a more efficient and secure \nfinancial infrastructure. For example, in addition to the regular administrative budget, MOC was \nallocated a specified budget of $200,000 for system development under subprogram 3. These \ninitiatives will further increase investor confidence and reduce the costs associated with financial \ntransactions. These costs are modest, however, when compared with the opportunity costs to \nCambodia  of  not further  developing  the finance  sector. The  loan for subprogram  3  will  be \nwithdrawn in a single tranche upon satisfactory completion of all subprogram policy triggers and \nfollowing loan effectiveness. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans.17 \n \n31.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  \nSDR9,876,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 3. The loan will \nhave a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. Loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign \nexchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries.18ADB will retain the \n \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of withdrawal application \ncertification. The closing date of the loan is 30 June 2015, by which date all proceeds of the loan \nwill have been fully disbursed. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n32.  The  NBC  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  MEF,  MOC,  and  SECC  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. The finance sector steering committee and the technical working group \n(TWG), as updated under regulation 393 of 21 June 2011, will oversee the implementation of the \nFSDS for 2011\u20132020 and coordinate with government ministries and agencies concerned. To \nensure  timely  program  implementation,  the  TWG\u2014chaired  by  a  senior  MEF  official  and \ncomprising  senior  officers  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  SECC,  and  other  relevant  government \nagencies\u2014will meet as needed to review progress and consider pending issues. The TWG will \nreport to the steering committee, chaired by the governor of the NBC, and will propose concrete \nactions to resolve any issues that arise. A senior officer of the NBC has been appointed as \nprogram director and will assist ADB in coordinating day-to-day program implementation with \nMEF, MOC, NBC, SECC, and other agencies. The program director will be required to submit \nquarterly  progress  reports  and  an  annual  report  on  the  overall  progress  of  subprogram \nimplementation and, in particular, on progress in implementing policy actions adopted for the \nprogram. The implementation period of subprogram 3 is from December 2012 to June 2014.  \n \n                                                \n15  ADB. 2011. Policy-Based Lending. Operations Manual. OM D4/BP.

The program will generate economic gains through successful implementation of medium- \nterm policy actions. A stronger legal, regulatory, and institutional framework will improve the \noperational efficiency of banks and ensure proper supervision and consumer protection. An \nimproved financial infrastructure will help broaden access to finance and other financial services. \nStrengthened finance sector governance will lead to better quality of financial reporting and \neffective  AML/CFT  measures.  Greater  finance  sector  efficiency  will  reduce  information  and \ntransaction costs of commercial activities. For example, under reasonably competitive market \nconditions with proper supervision and a low nonperforming loan ratio, the amount of credit \nextended in the sector will grow, with favorable terms and conditions for borrowers, especially a \nlower interest rate spread. Even under conservative assumptions, the estimated benefits of the \nprogram far exceed the loan amount. The expected benefits from a reduced interest margin were \nestimated at $125 million, against the total loan amount of the third program ($45 million).19 \n \nB.  Governance \n34.  An assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nunderstand fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements under the third \nprogram. The assessment considered ADB\u2019s report on Cambodia\u2019s country governance risk \nassessment and risk management plan,20 and the Public Expenditure Financial Accountability \nreport.21 Although these reports highlight weaknesses in the budgeting, auditing, reporting, and \ninternal control systems,22 the government\u2019s reform agenda under its 2004 Public Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program  has  produced  initial  positive  impacts.  Nonetheless,  ongoing \nmeasures are required to further improve the quality of financial reporting and auditing. ADB \nprovided support to the National Audit Authority to strengthen its capacity for auditing externally \nfunded projects. The government established CAFIU in 2010 to prevent transactions in breach of \nAML/CFT rules. Under subprogram 3, efforts continued to (i) promote corporate governance and \nfinancial literacy, (ii) promote the International Financial Reporting Standards in industries and \nacademia, and (iii) strengthen the enforcement of AML/CFT regulations. \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, the government will agree on certain covenants with ADB to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractices to refrain from engaging in activities such as corruption, money laundering, or the \nfinancing of terrorism.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n36.  Subprogram 3 is categorized as a general intervention to support sustainable economic \ngrowth and is expected to contribute to poverty reduction indirectly.23 Further, the promotion of \ninclusive finance facilitated by finance sector development expands the outreach of affordable \n                                                \n19  Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  ADB. 2012.

While finance sector reforms based on market principles have been gender \nneutral, the results show that improved access to financial services has brought more benefits to \nwomen in rural areas. The NBC reported that the proportion of women borrowers in MFI lending \nhad reached 82% in 2013. In the MFI subsector, women held 70% of deposits and accounted for \n30% of employees in 2013. These results show that subprogram 3 has contributed to increased \ngender benefits. Further study may be needed on whether women have less control over the use \nof loan money than men, or have limited access to long-term finance. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The program assumes continuing political stability and macroeconomic recovery from the \nglobal economic downturn. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 22).The main risks are external challenges to \n \nsustainable  economic  growth,  weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector,  and  weak \nexecution and implementation of policy reforms. With the design safeguards, the integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCE \n39.  The government and the NBC have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  loan  agreement.  No  disbursement  shall  be  made  unless  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the \ngovernment  has  completed  the  policy  actions  specified  in  the  policy  matrix  relating  to  the \nprogram. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR9,876,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for \nsubprogram 3 of the Third Financial Sector Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n27 October 2014 \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nA sound, market- Total private sector credit of banks  Annual reports, including  Continuing political \noriented finance  at 35% of GDP or more by 2017  audited financial reports of  stability \nsector that supports  (baselines: 29% in 2010; 48% in  banks, insurance firms, and   \nthe mobilization of  2013)  licensed MFIs  Macroeconomic \nfinancial resources      recovery from global \nTotal bank deposits at 45% of GDP  Progress reports from NBC  economic downturn \nor more by 2017 (baselines: 35% in     \n2010; 49% in 2013)    Risk \n    Slow recovery from \nAccess to credit for 15% or more of  Key financial data from NBC  global financial and \nthe population by 2017, of which at  economic shocks \nleast 60% are women (baselines: \n9% of total population in 2010, of \nwhich women account for 59%; \n13.2% and 78% in 2013) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA growing, resilient,  Increase of broad money supply to  National accounts, and  The government \nand efficient financial  45% of GDP or above by 2014  economic reports and official  remains committed to \nsystem  (baselines: 38% in 2010; 53% in  statistics of the Government  reforms and to \n2013)  of Cambodia and other  implementing the \n  international development  Financial Sector \n  agencies  Development \n    Strategy, 2011\u20132020 \nSolvency ratio of banks and MFIs  Published audited reports of    \nmaintained above 15% throughout  banks, MFIs, and insurance  Complementary \nthe program period (baselines 15%  firms  support from other \nin 2010; 25% for banks and 20%    development partners \nfor MFIs in 2013).     continues \n     \nRatio of NPLs to total loans of  Published audited reports of  Risk \nbanks maintained below 10%  banks, MFIs, and insurance \nSystemic risks in the \n(baselines: 3% in 2010; 3% in  firms \nfinancial system are \n2013) \nnot contained or \nmanaged in a \ncoordinated manner \nOutputs       \n1.
