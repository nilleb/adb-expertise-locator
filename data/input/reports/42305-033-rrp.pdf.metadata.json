The strategy was last updated for \n2011\u20132020.2 Reforms  under  the  FSDS  have  been  fully  discussed  with  all  relevant  government \nagencies,  industry  associations,  and  development  partners.  The  FSDS  has  also  incorporated \nrecommendations of the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) of the International \nMonetary  Fund  and  the World  Bank. The  Asian Development  Bank  (ADB) meets  regularly  with \nall  development  partners  in  the  finance  sector  to  discuss  current  issues,  and  development \npartners\u2019  coordination  was further  strengthened during the  update  of the  FSDS for  2011\u20132020. \nComprising three single-tranche subprograms, the third program to support the first phase of the \nFSDS for 2011-2020 will be completed at the conclusion of subprogram 3, following successful \ncompletion of subprograms 1 (footnote 1) and 2.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nCambodia  has  enjoyed  robust  economic  growth  and  was  one  of  the  world\u2019s  fastest-\ngrowing economies in the first decade of this century\u2014its real domestic gross product grew at an \nannual average of 9.1% between 1998 and 2008. Indirect impacts of the global economic crisis \nled to a slowdown in 2009 and 2010, but the recovery has been relatively quick and stable, even \novercoming  the  negative  impact  of  the  floods  in  2011  and  2013.  Economic  growth  has  been \nachieved  under  macroeconomic  stability  and  prudent  fiscal  policies.  Cambodia  also  made \nsignificant  progress  in  poverty  reduction  and  became  one  of  the  top  five  countries  in  the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. On the other hand, the country\u2019s economy has \nbeen characterized as being reliant on a narrow economic base, mostly garments and tourism in \nterms of foreign exchange earnings. Fiscal space is also limited due to low fiscal revenues and \ninsufficient  capacity  for  revenue  mobilization,  which  remains  a  major  constraint  to  meeting  the \ndevelopment  priorities  of  the  country.  While  the  expanding  manufacturing  and  service  sectors \ncould  make  the  country\u2019s  economy  more  inclusive  and  resilient  to  external  shocks,  a  robust \nmarket-based  finance  sector  is  needed  to  support  the  growing  economy.  Greater  connectivity \nand competition within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic community will be \nanother challenge for Cambodia. \n \n4. \nCambodia\u2019s  finance  sector  is  highly  dollarized  and  fragmented.  Under  the  dollarized \neconomy,  the  central  bank  has  only  limited  measures  to  implement  its  monetary  policies  and \nmanage  inflation.  It  also  has  limited  ability  to  provide  liquidity  as  \u201clender  of  last  resort.\u201d  The \nfinance sector has been growing significantly, although from a small base. The banking industry \nstill  dominates  the  finance  sector,  accounting  for  more  than  90%  of  assets  in  the  sector. \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2011.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nfor Subprogram 2 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Third Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 3002-CAM). \n\n\f2 \n\nMoreover,  the  banking  industry  itself  is  both  concentrated  and  fragmented  between  urban  and \nrural areas. The nonbanking segment and capital markets are at an early stage of development \nand  do  not  yet  have  significant  macroeconomic  impact.  Cambodia  is  now  leaving  the  post-\nconflict era and faces the dual challenge of ensuring further development of the finance sector to \nsupport sustainable economic growth while striving for monetary policy independence. \n \n5. \nThe  FSDS  for  2011\u20132020  is  aligned  with  Cambodia\u2019s  updated  National  Strategy  and \nDevelopment Plan (NSDP) for 2009\u20132013 and its Rectangular Strategy on Growth, Employment, \nEquity, and Efficiency, as well as with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for Cambodia, \n2011\u20132013.4\n The  government  launched  the  2009\u20132013  update  of  the  NSDP  in  mid-2010,  with \nthe  overarching  objective  of  reducing  poverty  to  19.5%  by  2015.  The  policy  priorities  of  the \nNSDP  update  intersect  closely  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  especially  in  the  core  areas  of \ninfrastructure,  education,  and  finance. 5 The  CPS  for  2011\u20132013  has  singled  out  the  finance \nsector  as  one  of  five  priority  sectors.  The  finance  sector  assessment  in  the  strategy  also \nidentified the lack of public confidence in the overall financial system as a key  constraint to the \ndevelopment of Cambodia\u2019s finance sector. \n \n6. \nADB has been the leading development partner of the finance sector in Cambodia since \n1999.  A  comprehensive  approach  was  required  to  rebuild  the  financial  system  in  a  devastated \neconomy that had no finance sector. Responding to the government\u2019s needs, the approach has \nbeen  broadly  based  so  far.  After  successfully  rebuilding  the  basic  foundation  of  the  banking \nindustry  under  the  first  and  second  programs, 6 the  third  program  has  begun  to  support  the \nsector\u2019s  expansion  to  cover  the  important  subsectors  of  nonbanking  services  and  capital \nmarkets, and to boost investors\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 confidence in the system with a stronger legal \nand  regulatory  framework,  necessary  infrastructure,  and  better  quality  of  services,  including \nconsumer protection. \n \n7. \nThe  third  program  has  focused  on  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  all  sector \nstakeholders, including the various regulators. The scope has shifted from the establishment of \nregulatory  frameworks  to  their  effective  implementation  and  oversight,  and  more  transparency. \nProper  financial  infrastructure  is  required  to  meet  rising  market  needs  for  more  efficient  and \ndiverse  financial  services,  as  is  further  development  of  the  legal  foundations  to  ensure  smooth \ntransactions in the sector. These reforms require coordination within the government and careful \nsequencing,  including  dialogue  with  the  private  sector.  The  third  program  has  been  facilitating \ncloser coordination. \n \nPast  and  ongoing  efforts  to  build  a  more  broad-based  and  resilient  finance  sector  in \n8. \nCambodia have yielded several lessons. First, as the scope of the sector expands, the need for \nconsultation,  coordination,  and  consensus  building  between  government  ministries  and \nagencies, and with the private sector, increases. This will require time and strong leadership  in \nplanning and executing policy measures. Second, finance sector development should be based \non a sequence of well-planned steps, where each step is supported by solid technical inputs. TA \nresources  are  essential  in  this  regard  and,  given  the  limited  availability  of  ADB  funds,  strong \ndonor coordination is essential. The third program experienced some positive outcomes of close \ndonor  consultation,  whereby  completion  of  policy  actions  was  made  possible  through  timely \ntechnical  inputs  of  other  development  partners.  Also,  some  initiatives  developed  by  ADB  have \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Cambodia, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n5  ADB.  2008.

Third,  a  long-term  engagement  establishes \nunderstanding and trust, which is vital for any reform program to succeed but indispensable for \nthe  finance  sector,  where  policy  actions  such  as  those  relating  to  interest  rates  or  foreign \nexchange  may  involve  significant  externalities.  Implementation  of  the  third  program  benefited \nfrom the strong relationship that ADB had built with government counterparts in over a decade of \nengagement in the sector, and the steps taken and progress made under subprogram 3 should \nbe viewed as the building blocks that will need to be assessed in a long-term perspective. \n \nADB will continue the policy dialogue with the government to maintain the momentum of \n9. \nthe  third  program  under  the  Post-Program  Partnership  Framework.  Also,  ADB\u2019s  technical \nassistance (TA) for implementing subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program has been \nextended  to  June  2015  to  deal  with  the  remaining  issues  (footnote  1).  However,  for  the  next \nround of support, ADB should concentrate on its areas of comparative advantage, in consultation \nwith other development partners and the government. A first dialogue with the government to this \nend has started in the process of formulating the CPS, sector assessment, and strategy and road \nmap with consideration to relevant ADB strategies on the finance sector development.7  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be a sound, market-oriented finance sector that supports the mobilization \n\n10. \nof financial resources. The outcome will be a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system.8 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n  The  third  program  comprises  three  single-tranche  subprograms  that  were  to  be \n11. \nimplemented  from  December  2010  to  December  2013.  Because  of  the  delay  caused  by  the \ngeneral election in July 2013, the implementation period was extended to June 2014.  In terms of \npolicy  actions,9  the  government  has  requested  minor  modifications  to  8  policy  triggers  and  2 \npolicy  milestones.  Among  modified  policy  actions,  one  policy  trigger  and  one  policy  milestone \nhave  now  been  incorporated  in  programs  of  other  development  partners  with  additional \nresources  to  support  related  capacity  building.  The  program  also  includes  an  additional  policy \ntrigger  involving  the  introduction  of  the  negotiable  certificate  deposit  program  to  improve \ncommercial  banks\u2019  liquidity  management.  Subprogram  3  has  20  policy  triggers  and  11  policy \nmilestones.  The  four  policy  triggers  are  still  on-going  and  are  expected  to  be  completed  by \nDecember  2014.  Further  details  are  provided  in  Appendix  4.  The  proposed  revisions  do  not \nmaterially  affect  the  program\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs.  Subprogram  3  has  four  outputs:  \n(i)  improved  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework;  (ii)  improved  financial  infrastructure; \n(iii)  strengthened  finance  sector  governance;  and  (iv)  enhanced  finance  sector  efficiency.  Key \nactivities for each output are described in paras. 12\u201329. \n \n\n                                                \n7 These  strategies  include  the  following:  ADB.  2011.

Manila. \n\n8   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9   Policy actions are policy triggers for the loan (noted in bold in the policy matrix  in Appendix 4). Policy milestones, \nwhile important in achieving the objectives of the program, are not policy triggers for the loan. They are presented to \nshow the additional reforms implemented by the government. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n1. \n\nImproved Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework \n\n12. \nUpdate and enhance the legal foundation for banks and microfinance institutions. \nUnder the Second Financial Sector Program,10 a comprehensive review  of the Law on Banking \nand  Financial  Institutions  (LBFI),  conducted  with  ADB  TA,  raised  issues  relating  to  consumer \nprotection,  bank  secrecy  provisions  to  support  the  development  of  a  credit  information-sharing \nsystem, administrative procedures for insolvent or distressed banks, and protection or immunity \nof  bank  regulators.  The  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  wanted  to  incorporate  other  FSAP \n(para. 2) inputs into the LBFI  and the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the NBC during \nFSP  III.  The  First  Initiatives  (a  trust  fund  administered  by  the  World  Bank)  provided  additional \nsupport  and  enabled  consultations  on  the  two  laws  between  the  World  Bank  and  government \nagencies.  The  consultation  process  further  delayed  the  implementation  of  the  required  policy \nactions,  so  the  NBC  decided  to  expedite  the  process  by  covering  the  issues  raised  through \nregulations  rather  than  amendments  to  the  laws  by  December  2014.  The  NBC  will  continue  to \nwork on the revision of the two laws to address current and emerging issues relating supervision \nas stipulated in the FSDS for 2011\u20132020.  \n \n13. \nStrengthen  bank  supervision  capacity  and  adopt  measures  to  sustain  financial \nstability. To coordinate finance sector supervision and to prepare for the event of financial crisis, \na  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  the  NBC,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance  (MEF),  and  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  of  Cambodia  (SECC)  was  prepared \nwith  TA  provided  by  the  World  Bank  that  included  workshops  on  and  simulation  of  a  financial \ncrisis. Following the consideration of the draft under subprogram 2, the MOU, which establishes \nprocedures for practical information exchange and coordination between (and accountability of) \ndomestic  supervisors  in  a  financial  crisis,  was  signed  in  July  2014.  It  is  a  critical  achievement \ngiven  the  highly  dollarized  economy  of  Cambodia.  Also,  NBC  drafted  a  national  strategy  to \npromote  the  use  of  riels  for  inter-ministerial  consultation.  Further,  based  on  the  prakas11  on \ninternal  control  and  corporate  governance,  the  NBC  has  completed  a  corporate  governance \nprofile of each licensed bank to be used for onsite inspection. \n \n14. \nStrengthen prudential supervision and regulations of microfinance institutions. The \nNBC  has  been  working to  improve  the quality  of  supervision  of  microfinance  institutions (MFIs) \nunder  subprograms  1  and  2.  The  Economist  Intelligence  Unit  report  on  microfinance  in  2013 \nranked  Cambodia  fifth  among  55  countries  in  the  category  of  regulatory  framework.12  Under \nsubprogram 3, the NBC completed an assessment of compliance with the Microfinance Activities \nand the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.13 Eight of the 29 principles are yet to \nbe  complied  with.  They  relate  to  the  compatibility  of  the  regulatory framework  with  the  banking \nindustry  and  the  risk  management  capacity  of  MFIs.  Further  work  will  pave  the  way  for  quality \nservices of MFIs and a more inclusive finance sector in Cambodia. \n \nEnhance the legal foundation to support financial and commercial transactions. A \n15. \nstrong  legal  foundation  to  support  financial  and  commercial  activities  is  critical  for  sound \neconomic development in Cambodia. Subprogram 2 supported the upgrade of the financial legal \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2007.

Under \nsubprogram 3, a draft consumer protection law and a draft comprehensive trust law  have been \nsubmitted to the Council of Ministers (COM), and the new Law on Insurance was cleared by the \nCOM and has been approved by the National Assembly. Initially, the trust law under subprogram \n3  was  intended  to  cover  only  MFIs,  but  after  consultation  with  stakeholders,  the  government \nrequested  an  expansion  in  scope  to  include  broader  economic  activities  and the supervision  of \nleasing companies. ADB agreed and provided additional TA inputs for drafting a comprehensive \ntrust  law.  The  secured  transaction  registry,  an  integral  part  of  lending  activities    to  protect \ncollaterals, was strengthened under the Secured Transaction Law as part of the third program\u2019s \nactivities.  Effective  coordination  between  development  partners  prompted  the  International \nFinance Corporation to join efforts to support the government in further improving the registry. \n \n16.  Confidence in the finance sector improved under Output 1. These progressive steps, \nwhich help make the financial system more resilient to external shocks, were made possible by \nclose  coordination  between  donors  and  efforts  to  increase  the  leverage  of  policy  reforms.  The \nrisk-weighted  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  banks  and  MFIs  has  been  maintained  above  20% \ncompared to the minimum ratio of 15%. Moreover, the trust scheme to protect the capital of MFIs, \nthe  consumer  protection  scheme,  and  the  improvement  to  the  secured  transaction  registry  all \ncontribute to building risk-mitigating measures and boosting confidence in the finance sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nImproved Financial Infrastructure \n\n17.  Modernize the national payments, clearance, and settlement system. Continued from \nsubprogram  1,  the  National  Clearing  System  was  commissioned  during  subprogram  2  and  the \nNBC  held  consultations  with  the  banking  industry  to  establish the  shared  switch  system  during \nsubprogram 3.14 The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) continued consultations with the NBC and the \nMinistry of Post and Telecommunications, on the drafting of the e-Commerce Law. The draft law \nis expected to be submitted to the COM by December 2014. \n \n18. \nEnhance consumer access to credit, consumer protection, and market confidence. \nContinued  from  subprograms  1  and  2,  a  privately  owned  credit  information  bureau\u2014the  Credit \nBureau  Cambodia  (CBC)\u2014was  established  in  2011  as  a  joint  venture  of  the  Association  of \nBanks  in  Cambodia,  the  Cambodia  Microfinance  Association,  and  an  international  service \nprovider.  It  began  operating  in  March  2012  during  subprogram  2.  The  CBC\u2019s  comprehensive \ncoverage  for  both  banking  and  MFIs  obtained  positive  feedback  on  addressing  the  over-\nindebtedness  issues.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  NBC  introduced  a  governance  structure  to \nmaintain  confidentiality  of  data  and  a  fee  table  acceptable  to  both  the  Association  of  Banks  in \nCambodia  and  the  Cambodia  Microfinance  Association.  While  working  on  strengthening  the \ninstitutional  framework,  the  NBC  together  with  industry  associations  also  carried  out  financial \nliteracy programs for the public, which attracted a majority of female participants. \n \n19. \nDevelop  the  interbank  and  government  securities  markets.  Commenced  under \nsubprogram  2,  MEF  continued  to  develop  market  procedures  for  Treasury  bills  under \nsubprogram  3.  However,  the  government\u2019s  debt  management  strategy  envisages  that  the \nissuance  of  government  bonds  would  not  take  place  until  2018.  In  September  2013,  the  NBC \nintroduced  the  negotiable  certificate  deposit  program  to  improve  banks\u2019  liquidity  management; \nthis  was  an  additional  initiative  under  the  third  program  to  further  broaden  banks\u2019  risk \nmanagement options. \n\n                                                \n14 The system for sharing information on the transactions of clients including balance and payments. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fDevelop  domestic  securities  market.  Under  subprogram  3,  SECC  has  submitted  the \n20. \ndraft sub-decree on bankruptcy initially prepared during subprogram 2 to the COM and initiated \nan evaluation of the legal framework for new markets, including collective investment schemes, \ncredit  rating  agency,  and  securities  borrowing  and  lending.  Commenced  during  subprogram  2, \nSECC  also  concluded  a  self-assessment  on  compliance  with  the  core  principles  of  the \nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions as a preparatory step for future application \nfor membership. SECC established an in-house customer complaint center to deal with investor \nprotection issues and, to increase its own capacity, started giving financial support to its staff for \nattending the chartered financial analyst program. \n \n21. \nDevelop insurance industry. ADB and MEF agreed to cancel the actuarial study on life \ninsurance to develop a mortality table, because it was deemed premature in view of the nascent \ncharacter  of  the  life  insurance  business,  which  only  started  in  2012.  However,  the  accounting \nguidelines for the insurance sector were developed under ADB TA during subprogram 3, creating \nthe foundation for sound growth of this important subsector. \n \nFinancial infrastructure  improved  under Output  2. The growth of the banking system \n22. \nhas further advanced the shift from risky cash-based transactions to safe and more transparent \nones that require proper records. The National Clearing System is an essential infrastructure to \nsettle  an \nremittances,  as  well  as  \ne-payments. The number of checks cleared daily has reached 3,837 in 2013 compared to 2,195 \nin 2010 with more electronic payments and transfers transacted. The e-Commerce Law aims to \nlay the legal foundation for e-payments. The CBC, with its broad database, effectively solved the \nissue of over-lending to a single entity. The third program has been supporting the development \nof  the  bond  and  capital  markets.  It  is  expected  that  these  markets  will  open  investment \nopportunities for the nonbanking industry (insurance and pension) in the medium term. \n \n\nincreasing  number  of  check  payments  and \n\n3. \n\nStrengthened Finance Sector Governance \n\n23. \nPromote  international  initiatives  on  anti-money  laundering  and  combating  the \nfinancing of terrorism. Cambodia has gained membership in the Asia Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering  and  is  committed  to  complying  with  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF) \nrecommendations,  international  conventions,  and  United  Nations  Security  Council  resolutions. \nCambodia is undergoing the FATF International Co-operation Review Group process and since \nJuly 2011 has been on the gray list of jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies in anti-money \nlaundering  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT),  but  high-level  political \ncommitment  to  rectifying  the  shortcomings  through  an  action  plan  has  been  made.  Cambodia \nissued a sub-decree on the establishment of a national AML/CFT coordination committee in April \n2012.  During  subprogram  2,  the  Cambodia  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  (CAFIU)  undertook  risk \nassessment of NBC supervised institutions. Under subprogram 3, the Prime Minister has granted \napproval  to  implement  the  national  risk  assessment  recommended  by  FATF,  and  authorized \nCAFIU  to  coordinate  it  with  all  relevant  ministries  and  agencies.  CAFIU  prepared  a  strategic \nimplementation  plan  for  the  national  risk  assessment,  which  it  submitted  to  the  CAFIU  board \nunder subprogram 3. \n \n24. \nEnhance  corporate  governance  and  transparency  in  the  finance  sector.  Under \nsubprogram 2, SECC started to promote the use of the code of corporate governance for listed \ncompanies  and  conducted  an  educational  campaign  with  emphasis  on  responsibilities  of  the \nboard of directors, corporate secretaries, and management. Under subprogram 3, the coverage \nwas expanded to non-listed companies. NBC started to collect the gender-segregated data on a \nregular basis. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fEstablish commercial dispute resolution mechanism. Under subprogram 2, MOC had \n25. \nundertaken to establish the National Arbitration Center (NAC) with the joint support of ADB and \nInternational Finance Corporation. NAC\u2019s first general assembly for the election of the first board \nof  directors  was  held  in  January  2013,  and  the  directors,  including  representatives  from  the \nprivate  sector,  were  duly  appointed.  Subprogram  3  helped  the  recruitment  and  training  of  new \narbitrators  and  finalized  the  business  plan  for  NAC  to  ensure  its  operational  and  financial \nsustainability. MOC cemented its commitment to NAC by granting it office space. NAC was duly \noperationalized at the first board of directors\u2019 meeting in July 2014. \n \n26. \nImprove  accounting  and  auditing  profession.  Although  the  draft  Accounting  and \nAuditing  Law  had  been  submitted  to  the  COM  under  subprogram  2,  it  was  returned  to  MEF \nbecause of a deficiency relating to sanctions. The draft law is expected to be resubmitted to the \nCOM  by  December  2014.  Financial  support  for  a  new  university  curriculum  based  on \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards and for an existing scholarship program continues to \nbuild the number of local qualified accountants. \n \nGovernance  and transparency  strengthened under  Output  3. Good governance has \n27. \nbeen  a  priority  throughout,  and  the  third  program  in  particular  has  supported  the  government\u2019s \ncommitments  to  the  international  community.  This  will  improve  the  finance  sector\u2019s  reputation \nand the international community\u2019s confidence in the country. The audited financial statements of \nfinancial institutions are publicly disclosed. The support for AML/CFT is expected to contribute to \nCambodia\u2019s  removal  from  the  FATF  gray  list.  The  promotion  of  corporate  governance  and \nadoption of internationally recognized financial reporting standards will further assure investors. \nThe  establishment  of  an  alternative  dispute  resolution  mechanism  outside  the  courts  confirms \nCambodia\u2019s commitment to the World Trade Organization membership. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnhanced Finance Sector Efficiency \n\n28.  Modernize  the  business  registration  system.  Based  on  the  assessment  conducted \nunder  subprogram  1,  it  concluded  that  MOC\u2019s  corporate  registration  system  needs  to  be \nconsolidated  and  upgraded  to  improve  the  national  database  of  corporate  entities  and  make \ncorporate  information  more  accessible  to  stakeholders  in  the  financial  market,  be  it  investors, \nlenders,  or  the general public.  This  will  reduce  transaction costs  and  improve efficiency.  Under \nsubprogram 3 and with TA from ADB, an adequate budget was provided and the consolidation \nprocess  commenced.  The  World  Bank  approached  MOC  and  agreed  to  continue  the  initiative \nwith support from  the Trade Swap  Fund  (a  trust  fund administered  by  the World  Bank). This  is \nexpected to be a more comprehensive endeavor. \n \n29. \nEfficiency  enhanced  under  Output  4.  The  company  registration  system  and  its \ncorporate  data  are  a  prerequisite for  lenders  and  investors  to  conduct  initial  credit  evaluations. \nWithout provision of affordable and reliable data, the evaluation process is lengthier and costlier. \nOnce  a  proper  and  efficient  system  is  established,  the  lending  rates  of  financial  institutions \nreflecting reduced transaction costs will be more affordable and economy of scale in term of fees \ncharged will come from an expanding small and medium enterprise sector.  \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe  third  program,  with  its  three subprograms,  requires  a total  of  $45 million  equivalent \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources. The size of the budget support program depends on (i) the \nfinancing  needs  for  sector  development  as  identified  during  country  programming  and  strategy \nformulation;  (ii)  the  importance  the  government  attaches  to  the  reform  program;  and  (iii) the \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nestimated  costs  of  designing  and  implementing  the  medium-term  reform  program  minus  the \nestimated financial support from other development partners.15 This estimate includes costs that \nmust be absorbed by the government to support the growing finance sector. For example, growth \nin quantity (number of financial institutions) and quality (need for more sophisticated supervision) \nrequires greater government capacity in terms of well-qualified staff, proper institutional settings, \nand  system  support.  The  estimate  also  includes  system  development  and  upgrades  of \nparticipating agencies and self-regulatory organizations16 to ensure a more efficient and secure \nfinancial infrastructure. For example, in addition to the  regular administrative budget, MOC  was \nallocated  a  specified  budget  of  $200,000  for  system  development  under  subprogram  3.  These \ninitiatives will further increase investor confidence and reduce the costs associated with financial \ntransactions.  These  costs  are  modest,  however,  when  compared  with  the  opportunity  costs  to \nCambodia  of  not  further  developing  the  finance  sector.  The  loan  for  subprogram  3  will  be \nwithdrawn in a single tranche upon satisfactory completion of all subprogram policy triggers and \nfollowing loan effectiveness. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with the \nprovisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram Loans.17 \n \n31. \nto  \nSDR9,876,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 3. The loan will \nhave  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries.18\n ADB will retain the \nright  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  withdrawal  application \ncertification. The closing date of the loan is 30 June 2015, by which date all proceeds of the loan \nwill have been fully disbursed. \n \nE. \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  government  has \n\nrequested  a \n\nloan \n\n32. \nThe  NBC  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  MEF,  MOC,  and  SECC  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. The finance sector steering committee and the technical working group \n(TWG), as updated under regulation 393 of 21 June 2011, will oversee the implementation of the \nFSDS  for  2011\u20132020  and  coordinate  with  government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned.  To \nensure  timely  program  implementation,  the  TWG\u2014chaired  by  a  senior  MEF  official  and \ncomprising  senior  officers  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  SECC,  and  other  relevant  government \nagencies\u2014will meet as needed to review progress and consider pending issues. The TWG will \nreport to the steering committee, chaired by the governor of the NBC, and will propose concrete \nactions  to  resolve  any  issues  that  arise.  A  senior  officer  of  the  NBC  has  been  appointed  as \nprogram  director  and  will  assist  ADB  in  coordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation  with \nMEF,  MOC,  NBC,  SECC,  and  other  agencies.  The  program  director  will  be  required  to  submit \nquarterly  progress  reports  and  an  annual  report  on  the  overall  progress  of  subprogram \nimplementation  and,  in  particular,  on  progress  in  implementing  policy  actions  adopted  for  the \nprogram. The implementation period of subprogram 3 is from December 2012 to June 2014.  \n \n\n                                                \n15  ADB. 2011. Policy-Based Lending. Operations Manual.

The program will generate economic gains through successful implementation of medium- \nterm  policy  actions.  A  stronger  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  will  improve  the \noperational  efficiency  of  banks  and  ensure  proper  supervision  and  consumer  protection.  An \nimproved financial infrastructure will help broaden access to finance and other financial services. \nStrengthened  finance  sector  governance  will  lead  to  better  quality  of  financial  reporting  and \neffective  AML/CFT  measures.  Greater  finance  sector  efficiency  will  reduce  information  and \ntransaction  costs  of  commercial  activities.  For  example,  under  reasonably  competitive  market \nconditions  with  proper  supervision  and  a  low  nonperforming  loan  ratio,  the  amount  of  credit \nextended in the sector will grow, with favorable terms and conditions for borrowers, especially a \nlower interest rate spread. Even under conservative assumptions, the estimated benefits of the \nprogram far exceed the loan amount. The expected benefits from a reduced interest margin were \nestimated at $125 million, against the total loan amount of the third program ($45 million).19 \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n34. \nAn assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nunderstand  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  under  the  third \nprogram.  The  assessment  considered  ADB\u2019s  report  on  Cambodia\u2019s  country  governance  risk \nassessment  and  risk  management  plan,20  and  the  Public  Expenditure  Financial  Accountability \nreport.21  Although  these reports  highlight  weaknesses in  the  budgeting,  auditing, reporting,  and \ninternal  control  systems,22  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  under  its  2004  Public  Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program  has  produced  initial  positive  impacts.  Nonetheless,  ongoing \nmeasures  are  required  to  further  improve  the  quality  of  financial  reporting  and  auditing.  ADB \nprovided support to the National Audit Authority to strengthen its capacity for auditing externally \nfunded projects. The government established CAFIU in 2010 to prevent transactions in breach of \nAML/CFT rules. Under subprogram 3, efforts continued to (i) promote corporate governance and \nfinancial  literacy,  (ii)  promote  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  in  industries  and \nacademia, and (iii) strengthen the enforcement of AML/CFT regulations. \n \n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  government  will  agree  on  certain  covenants  with  ADB  to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractices  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  activities  such  as  corruption,  money  laundering,  or  the \nfinancing of terrorism.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n36. \nSubprogram  3  is  categorized  as a general  intervention to support sustainable economic \ngrowth and is  expected  to  contribute to  poverty  reduction  indirectly.23  Further, the  promotion of \ninclusive  finance  facilitated  by  finance  sector  development  expands  the  outreach  of  affordable \n\n                                                \n19  Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  ADB. 2012.

While  finance  sector  reforms  based  on  market  principles  have  been  gender \nneutral, the results show that improved access to financial services has brought more benefits to \nwomen in rural areas. The NBC reported that the proportion of women borrowers in MFI lending \nhad reached 82% in 2013. In the MFI subsector, women held 70% of deposits and accounted for \n30% of employees in 2013. These results show that subprogram 3 has contributed to increased \ngender benefits. Further study may be needed on whether women have less control over the use \nof loan money than men, or have limited access to long-term finance. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is  classified \n\n37. \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe program assumes continuing political stability and macroeconomic recovery from the \n38. \nglobal economic downturn. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 22). The main risks are external challenges to \nsustainable  economic  growth,  weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector,  and  weak \nexecution  and  implementation  of  policy  reforms.  With  the  design  safeguards,  the  integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCE \n\n39. \nThe  government  and  the  NBC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and disbursement  as described in detail \nin  the  loan  agreement.  No  disbursement  shall  be  made  unless  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the \ngovernment  has  completed  the  policy  actions  specified  in  the  policy  matrix  relating  to  the \nprogram. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n40. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR9,876,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for \nsubprogram 3 of the Third Financial Sector Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n27 October 2014 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nA sound, market-\noriented finance \nsector that supports \nthe mobilization of \nfinancial resources \n\nOutcome \nA growing, resilient, \nand efficient financial \nsystem \n\nOutputs \n1.

Subprogram 3 has 20 policy triggers and 11 milestones. \nWith changing domestic circumstances and developmental priorities, the executing and implementing agencies requested minor modifications to some of the policy \ntriggers and  milestones indicated  below.  These  minor changes  were subject  to  the  endorsement of  ADB  Management.  The  ADB  Management  Review  Meeting, \nheld  in  August  2014,  confirmed  the  changes  to  proposed  items,  and  the  additional  items  ii  and  xviii  were  confirmed  later  by  ADB  Management  and  prior  to \ncirculation of the report and recommendation of the President.

This is a part of 2010 FSAP \nrecommendations and supported by World \nBank TA. NBC decided to address the issues \non the two laws by issuing the supporting \nregulations instead of amending the laws.

ADB continues to provide support by \nthe national IT consultant. The update of the \nregistry will be completed by June 2015. \nDuring processing, the feedback indicated that \na comprehensive trust law would be more \nsuitable than a financial trust law. The \nexpansion of scope was requested by the \ngovernment. It was agreed and the additional \ninputs have been provided. \nNBC has successfully introduced a new NCD \nprogram to improve the liquidity management \nof the banking sector in September 2013.   \nThe implementation has been delayed \nbecause of intensive consultations with \nrelevant stakeholders. \nLife insurance sector in Cambodia is still \nnascent. It was established only in 2012 and \ncounts just three life insurance companies as \nof 2013. It is too early to develop a mortality \ntable. The priority is still relatively low and it \nwas agreed to postpone and wait for further \ndevelopment of the life insurance market.   \nIt was pointed out that the original milestone is \nalmost identical with the milestone xiv. NBC to \nliaise with the ABC and the CMA to formulate \nand implement a financial literacy program \ncovering at least 50% participation by women. \nNBC agreed to replace with other gender-\nrelated initiative.  \n \nUnder subprogram 2, the draft law was \n\n \n\n\f30  Appendix 4 \n\nOriginal Trigger/Milestone  \nAccounting and Auditing Law to the \nNational Assembly \n\nRevised Trigger/Milestone  \nAccounting and Auditing Law to the \nCouncil of Ministers \n\nxxx.
