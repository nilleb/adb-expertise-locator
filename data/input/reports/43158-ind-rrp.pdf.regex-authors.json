The reduction in credit, stagnation in domestic demand, \nsharp  decline  in  exports,  and  overall  crisis  of  confidence  that \nfollowed  the  global  crisis  have  added  to  the  burden  faced  by \nmicro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the form of \nlong-standing  systemic  constraints.  These  include  limited \ninstitutional credit, high-cost borrowing, weak marketing facilities, \npoor infrastructure, technological obsolescence, and a perception \nthat  they  are  high-risk  enterprises.  This  sector  is  the  second-\nlargest  employer  after  agriculture,  and  the  Government  has \ntherefore taken steps to enhance credit flows to it. The various \nother  fiscal  and  monetary  stimulus  measures  taken  by  the \nGovernment\u2014such  as  increasing  public  spending,  offering  tax \ncuts, and lowering various bank policy rates\u2014are also indirectly \ndesigned  to  support  the  MSME  sector.  The  Government  has \nasked the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) \nand  the  commercial  banks  to  increase  their  lending  to  the \nMSMEs. It has also been actively mobilizing additional external \nfunding. \n \nThe proposed intervention will be an innovative, hybrid program ", "ii  \nthat  combines  ADB's  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  lending \nmodalities,  and  incorporates  financing  earmarked  for \nmicroenterprises  and  qualified  women  entrepreneurs,  with  the \noverarching  goal  of  promoting  inclusive  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment in India. The Project has been designed to reach \ndifferent segments of the MSME sector. The smaller and less \nestablished micro and small enterprises (MSEs), which operate \nprimarily  in  the  informal  sector,  will  be  targeted  through  the \nsovereign loan to the SIDBI. The larger medium-sized enterprises, \nwhich have limited access to bank finance, will be targeted under \nthe  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  facility,  which  will  be \nestablished without a counter-guarantee from the Government. \nThe two financing modalities will be effectively complementary. \nThe PCG would help expose India's public sector banks to the \ninternational  capital  markets  and  facilitate  capital  market \ndevelopment, while attracting additional funds that would be used \nfor the MSME sector, which has tremendous potential to facilitate \nbroad-based growth. This additionality is important, especially in \nthe context of the Government's enhanced borrowing program, \nwhich is partly a result of its stimulus package, and the concerns \nof crowding out that it has raised.   \n \nThe Project has been designed to avoid duplicating or countering \nongoing  initiatives  of  other  donors  operating  in  India\u2019s  MSME \nsector\u2014namely the Department for International Development of \nthe United Kingdom, German development cooperation through \nthe  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ),  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  KfW,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  United \nNations  Industrial  Development  Organization\u2014but  would  help \nbuild on their work and expand their reach. ADB would coordinate \nclosely with the ongoing programs of the donor partners, and be \nguided by their harmonized results framework.  \n \nThe provision of financing alone, however, will not be sufficient to \naddress the specific needs and constraints of micro and small \nentrepreneurs,  who  are  predominantly  women.  Support  for \ncapacity  development  interventions  that  target  this  borrower \nsegment is urgently needed, and will be provided by the capacity \nbuilding  grant  (CBG)  of  up  to  $3  million,  currently  under \nconsideration by the Government of Japan (GOJ), to be financed \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). It would support \ninnovative  approaches  to  the  promotion  of  women's \nmicroenterprises that operate primarily in the informal sector. \n   \nRationale  While several factors constrain the growth and competitiveness of \nIndian MSMEs, key among these are the problems that MSMEs \nface in accessing adequate and timely financing on competitive \nterms. This has slowed (i) the establishment of small companies, \n(ii) their growth into medium-sized enterprises, and (iii) the overall \ngrowth and development of the MSME sector. ", "  iii\nIn view of these constraints, the Government, SIDBI (which is the \napex bank for MSMEs in India), and a number of commercial \npublic sector banks have requested that ADB support efforts to (i) \nremove the bottlenecks that constrain MSME access to finance, \nand  (ii)  foster  MSME  development.  Various  measures  are \nrequired  to  initiate  bank  financing,  particularly  term  loans,  to \ncommercially viable MSMEs. To this end, lending support has \nbeen sought in the form of a loan to SIDBI that would be used to \nprovide  term  financing  to  microenterprises  that  make  up  the \n\"missing middle\" segment among MSME borrowers. These small \nborrowers have potential and have done well in the past, but have \ngrown  too  large  for  traditional  microfinance  support  while \nremaining unable to access more conventional (bank) financing, \nbecause they (i) are still seen as not creditworthy, or (ii) lack the \nnecessary  skills,  capacity,  and  experience  to  access  such \nfinancing. \n \nThe establishment of a PCG facility will help stimulate a higher \nvolume  of  commercial  bank  lending,  primarily  to  the  larger \nMSMEs, which are typically already bank customers.  \n \nThe JFPR-financed CBG, currently under consideration by the \nGOJ,  will  provide  greater  access  to  skills  and  technology  for \nmicroenterprises run by women, and address the various gender-\nrelated constraints they face.  \n \nThe combined results of the various elements under the Project \nwill demonstrate that it is possible to expand lending to MSMEs \nwithout compromising on loan quality.   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the proposed intervention will be to help MSMEs in \nIndia  realizing  their  full  potential,  thereby  assisting  domestic \nMSMEs  to  be  fully  developed,  especially  those  led  by  female \nmicroentrepreneurs.  \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  MSME  access  to \ncommercial  financing,  capacity  building  services  and  market \nopportunities, thereby fostering MSME growth, competitiveness, \nand employment. \n   \nOutputs   The  Project  is  designed  to  achieve  its  objectives  through  a \nmultipronged approach that will address key bottlenecks to MSME \nfinancing  and  development  in  India  by  focusing  on  (i)  helping \ncommercial public sector banks gain better access to longer-term \nfinancing for onlending to their MSME clients in selected states (to \nbe agreed with ADB) of India by setting up a PCG facility of up to \n$250  million  without  a  government  counterindemnity;  and  (ii) \nsupporting the so-called \u201cmissing middle\u201d borrower segment of \nmicroenterprises through an ADB loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  which  will  provide  dollar \nfinancing  to  SIDBI  for  onlending  to  MSME  clients  in  Andhra \n ", "iv  \nPradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and \nWest Bengal.  \n   \nCost Estimates and  The  proposed  PCG  facility  of  up  to  $250  million,  without \nFinancing Plan  government counterindemnity, will be provided from ADB's OCR. \n  The  PCG  facility  will  be  made  available  to  one  or  more \nparticipating  banks  comprised  of  the  large  commercial  public \nsector banks in India, and will cover a portion of principal and/or \ninterest payments on a US dollar or other major foreign currency \ndenominated  loan  made  to  or  bond  issued  by  one  or  more \nparticipating banks and sold to investors.  \n \nSIDBI will be the Borrower and the Executing Agency (EA) of the \nADB  loan  of  $50  million  to  be  funded  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR.  The \nproposed loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of \n3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate-based  lending  facility,  and  a \ncommitment fee of 0.15 per annum and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government \nwill provide a guarantee to ADB in respect of the proposed loan.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Each PCG will cover less than 100% of principal and interest of \nTerms  the underlying debt instrument1 with a tenor of 5 years (maximum \n10  years,  on  a  strictly  exceptional  basis).  In  accordance  with \nADB's exposure policy,2 the maximum amount of each underlying \ndebt instrument will be the lower of $250 million and 50% of the \nnet worth of the relevant participating bank. It is expected that the \nguaranteed debt instrument will be denominated in US dollars. \nHowever,  the  ADB  guaranteed  debt  instrument  can  also  be \ndenominated in Japanese yen or euros, in which case the PCG \nwill be denominated in the same currency as the underlying debt \ninstrument. The participating banks will use the proceeds from the \nADB-guaranteed debt instrument to increase their commercially-\npriced loan portfolio with their MSME clients.  \n \nThe loan proceeds will be lent directly to SIDBI in dollars and for a \n15-year term pursuant to a loan agreement with such other terms \nand conditions acceptable to ADB. The Government will provide a \nguarantee to ADB in respect of the proposed loan and will charge \nSIDBI  an  appropriate  guarantee  fee.  Onlending  by  SIDBI  to \neligible subborrowers will be at interest rates that reflect SIDBI\u2019s \ncost of funds plus a spread to cover transaction costs and risks. \nSubloans will be on full commercial and competitive terms. \n                                                 \n1  PCG from ADB will cover up to 80%\u201395% of the financial instruments to be issued by the participating banks to \nachieve a certain target rating aimed at maximizing investor base and allowing the participating banks to tap longer \nterm financing at reasonable rates. The actual PCG cover may be less and will depend on the actual guaranty \nscheme to be finalized with the participating banks. The credit conversion factor that applies to the PCG will \ndepend on the specific guaranty conditions and will be determined as PCGs are established at the bank level \nwhich will be subject to review by the Office of Risk Management and approval by the Investment Committee. \n2  ADB. 2009. Review of the Asian Development Bank's Exposure Limits on Nonsovereign Operations. Manila. ", "  v\nPeriod of Utilization  The availability period of the PCG facility will be 3 years from \nADB Board of Directors approval, but may however be extended \nas per ADB policy. The loan to SIDBI will be implemented over 5 \nyears from loan effectiveness. The closing date for submission of \ndrawdown  applications,  and  approval  and  authorization  for \ndisbursement  from  the  loan,  will  be  31  December  2014.  The \nclosing date for disbursements will be 30 June 2015. \n   \nParticipating Bank  The following criteria will be used to determine the eligibility of \nSelection Criteria under  commercial  public  sector  banks  for  participation  in  the  PCG \nthe PCG Facility  facility:  (i)  an  international  credit  rating  of  minimum  BB+  or  a \ndomestic rating of AA if the participating bank does not have an \ninternational rating; (ii) experience and outreach in the delivery of \nfinancial services to MSME clients; (iii) focused marketing plans \nand capacity to develop new MSME products using the proceeds \nfrom  the  ADB-enhanced  instrument;  (iv)  loan  origination  and \nadministration  capacities,  skills,  and  standards;  (v)  overall \nfinancial  standing  as  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s  internal \nguidelines; and (vi) a net nonperforming loan ratio of not more \nthan 3% for its MSME portfolio. \n \nIn order to receive guarantee support under the PCG facility, ADB \nwill carry out a thorough due diligence of each interested bank. \nThe due diligence will be conducted according to a set of well-\nestablished criteria and procedures. \n   \nUse of ADB Loan  In line with SIDBI's existing organizational setup which divides \nProceeds  SIDBI's  business  activities  into  direct  and  indirect  lending \noperations, an amount of at least 30% of the ADB loan will be \nused by SIDBI for direct financing of commercially viable MSMEs. \nQualified female entrepreneurs will be given preference to access \nthe loan. For its direct lending operations, SIDBI will ensure that at \nleast 30% of the subborrowers will be qualified female MSME \nentrepreneurs. \n \nSIDBI's branches will use the 30% allocation of the ADB loan to \nprovide subloans in local currency ranging from Rs50,000\u2013Rs1 \nmillion (approximately $1,042\u2013$20,824) and with maturities of up \nto 7 years to its larger and more mature MSME clients that want to \ngraduate from microfinance institutions support and move into the \nformal financial sector.  \n \n70% of the ADB financing will be utilized by SIDBI to provide \nfunding  for  onlending  to  MSMEs  to  participating  financial \ninstitutions  (PFIs)  which  could  either  be  scheduled  banks, \nnonbank financial companies, or microfinance institutions. \n   \nSubborrowers Selection  The following MSMEs will be eligible subborrowers to access the \nCriteria under the  proposed loan as subborrowers. \nProposed Loan  (i)  MSMEs must be economically and financially viable. \n(ii)  MSMEs will be eligible if undertaking start-up, expansion, \n ", "v i \ndiversification,  or  modernization  activities  in  any  of  the \neligible  subsectors,  except  those  on  ADB's  prohibited \ninvestment list.  \n(iii)  MSMEs must comply with SIDBI's and ADB\u2019s environmental \nand social safeguard policies. \n(iv)  MSMEs  cannot  be  involved  in  any  activities  that  would \ngenerate permanent or temporary involuntary resettlement, \nincluding for squatters. \n(v)  MSMEs must be in one of the selected Indian states. \n   \nImplementation  The South Asia Financial Sector, Public Management and Trade \nArrangements  Division  of  ADB,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Office  of \nCofinancing Operations, will structure, process, and monitor the \nPCG facility, while SIDBI will implement the loan. \n \nThe $250 million PCG facility is proposed to be established as an \numbrella program, the framework of which is presented for Board \napproval. Eligible participating banks will be subject to detailed \ndue diligence, and specific guarantee structure, amount, terms \nand  conditions,  as  well  as  pricing  rationale  will  be  subject  to \nfurther Office of Risk Management's review and presented to the \nInvestment Committee for approval.    \n \nA review of the Project will be undertaken within 3 years from the \nBoard approval to assess continuing relevance. Such a review \nmay be undertaken earlier as market conditions warrant. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under ADB-financed subloans will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time),  as  these  relate  to  financial  intermediary  loans. \nSubborrowers  will  be  required  to  undertake  procurement  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices that are acceptable to ADB. \n   \nCapacity Building Grant  Although it is not a loan component, the associated CBG of up to \n$3 million from the JFPR, currently under consideration by the \nGOJ, will help enhance the capacity of women entrepreneurs and \nassociations to more systematically access the financial resources \nincluding that which will be made available under the proposed \nintervention. \n \nThe CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, funded by \nJFPR of up to $3 million will support the gender and capacity-\nbuilding  interventions  addressing  the  specific  needs  and \nconstraints  faced  by  low-income  women  entrepreneurs  in  the \nunorganized sector. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to contribute to (i) a financially stronger \nBeneficiaries  SIDBI that is better equipped to expand its portfolio of loans to \nMSEs,  (ii)  expanded  MSME  lending  by  the  commercial  public \nsector banks participating in the PCG facility, (iii) an improved ", "  vii\nenabling  environment  for  MSMEs,  and  (iv)  increased  MSME \ngrowth and job creation by MSMEs. All segments of the MSME \nsector  are  expected  to  benefit  from  better  access  to  and \naugmented availability of finance.  \n \nAssuming an average subloan size of Rs250,000 (approximately \n$5,208) under the \"missing middle\" output of the Project, and a \nsubloan  size  of  Rs1  million  (about  $20,833)  under  the  PCG \nfacility, it can be expected that approximately 30,000 MSMEs will \nbenefit  from  the  Project.  Using  the  estimate  that  lending  Rs1 \nmillion  generates  approximately  three  additional  jobs,  a  rough \ncalculation indicates at least 7,500 jobs will be created.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  (i)  Macroeconomic  risk.  A  slower-than-expected  recovery \nfrom the current global financial crisis could dampen growth \nprospects  in  India.  However,  current  projections  for  India \nindicate a relatively high average growth of 6%, and 7% in \n2010, as the global economy begins to emerge from this \nunprecedented crisis.  \n(ii)  Credit risk. MSMEs typically carry higher credit risk due to \nthe lack of accurate and reliable financial information on their \nperformance, underdeveloped management capabilities and \ngovernance structure, as well as greater vulnerabilities to \ndownside  market  factors.  The  program  aims  to  focus  on \nPFIs  and  participating  banks  that  have  a  robust  risk \nmanagement infrastructure and established risk assessment \nmethodologies  that  are  specifically  tailored  to  the  MSME \nsector,  and  which  have  a  demonstrated  track  record  in \nMSME lending. Detailed due diligence will cover the banks' \noperations in general but will also include an assessment of \nthe PFIs and participating banks' performance in its MSME \nportfolio  which  will  cover  asset  quality,  provisioning \nstandards, cost to income structure, etc. of this particular \nbusiness segment. \n(iii)  Effective  fund  disbursement  through  SIDBI.  SIDBI  is \nexpected  to  be  able  to  channel  the  proceeds  from  the \nproposed ADB loan effectively, given its strong commitment \nto  the  Project  and  broad  network  of  branches.  SIDBI \nmanages  an  MSME  portfolio  of  over  $5  billion,  and  has \nsustained  continued  good  financial  performance  while \nexpanding  its  business\u2014overall  disbursements  grew  by \n87.56% in FY2009, totaling Rs282.97 billion ($5.9 billion)\u2014\nwhile maintaining a net nonperforming loan ratio of less than \n1%.  An  effective  distribution  network  and  experience  in \nMSME lending are among several key criteria to be looked \nat  as  well  in  evaluating  participating  banks  under  the \nprogram. \n(iv)  Currency mismatch. As the proposed loan to SIDBI and the \nfunds  to  be  raised  through  the  PCG  facility  will  be \ndenominated  in  US  dollars  (or  other  major  foreign \ncurrencies), and the borrowers or issuers may need to swap \n ", "v iii \nthese  proceeds  into  Indian  rupees  to  onlend  to  MSME \nclients,  there  is  a  potential  currency  mismatch.  However, \nSIDBI, the PFIs and the participating banks have the option \nof entering into hedging arrangements to mitigate the foreign \nexchange  risk.  In  addition,  SIDBI,  the  PFIs,  and  the \nparticipating banks also provide loans in foreign currencies \nto exporting MSMEs, which conduct most of their (export \nand import) business in foreign currencies.  \n(v)  Asset quality of the potential participating banks for the \nPCG facility. The assets of the commercial public sector \nbanks  in  India  have  grown  rapidly  in  the  last  few  years, \nwhich could potentially compromise their loan books. Due \ndiligence  will  look  closely  at  the  impaired  assets  of  the \nparticipating banks, the extent of restructured loans as well \nas loan classification and provisioning standards to ensure \nthat only participating banks with solid asset quality will be \nconsidered. \n(vi)  Pressures  on  Capitalization  for  potential  participating \nbanks for the PCG facility. Rapid asset growth over the \nlast few years has exerted pressure on capitalization and the \nneed to strengthen this is critical particularly in the context of \nIndia's challenging credit environment. This is mitigated by \nthe selection criteria for participating banks which include \namong others: (a) the Government's continued support as \nreflected in the participating banks' recapitalization program \nand the Government's long-term ownership plans for these \nparticipating banks; and (b) track record in accessing capital \nmarkets.  ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for the Micro, Small, \nand Medium Enterprise Development Project (the Project) on (i) a proposed loan of $50 million \nto the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), to be guaranteed by India; and (ii) a \npartial credit guarantee (PCG) facility, without counterguarantee from India, of $250 million in \nsupport of one or more financial instruments provided by one or more commercial public sector \nbanks in India. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Country and Sector Background \n \n2.  Poverty reduction and social development through faster and more inclusive growth is \nthe core goal of India's 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2007\u20132012). It emphasizes the need to \nbridge  existing  divides\u2014between  sectors,  regions,  and  genders\u2014to  ensure  that  a  greater \nproportion of the population can participate in and benefit from India's growth. The micro, small, \nand medium enterprise (MSME) sector in India has immense potential to generate such broad-\nbased employment and income growth. MSMEs typically have comparatively high labor-capital \nratios, shorter gestation periods, lower investment requirements, and can effectively mobilize \nlocal resources of capital and skills that would otherwise remain unutilized.  \n \n3.  The definition of MSMEs in the Indian context has traditionally focused on small-scale \nindustries (defined as industries with a cumulative investment in plant and machinery of up to \nRs10 million). More recently, however, the landmark Small and Medium Enterprises Fund and \nthe  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprises  Development  Act  of  2006  have  expanded  the \nconcept  of  enterprise  to  include  not  just  enterprises  engaged  in  the  production  of  goods \npertaining to any industry but also enterprises engaged in providing or rendering services. The \nact also clearly classifies \u201cmedium enterprises\u201d as those in which investments in plant and \nmachinery  do  not  exceed  Rs100  million  (approximately  $2.5  million),  excluding  land  and \nbuilding. Service sectors have different limits (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Classification of Enterprises into Different Categories (New Definitions) \n \n  Investment Ceiling (excluding land and building) \nClassification  Manufacturing  Service \nMicro  < Rs2.5 million ($52,083)  < Rs1 million ($20,833) \nSmall  \u2265 Rs2.5 million and < Rs5.0 million   \u2265 Rs1 million and < Rs20 million \n($52,083 and $104,167)  ($20,833 and $416,667) \nMedium  \u2265 Rs5.0 million and < Rs100 million  \u2265 Rs20 million < Rs50 million \n($104,167 and $2.083 million)  ($416,667 and $1.041 million) \nSource: Biswas, I. and M.

It is estimated that the MSME sector in India accounts for around 95% of industrial \nenterprises,  45%  of  gross  industrial  production,  and  40%  of  exports,1 and  provides  direct \nemployment to 42 million persons in around 12.8 million registered MSMEs.

", "2  \nconsistently registered a higher growth rate than the rest of the industrial sector. Over 6,000 \nproducts, including traditional and high technology items, are manufactured by MSMEs in India. \n \n5.  However, as noted in the 11th FYP, MSMEs do not simply contribute to gross domestic \nproduct, but touch the lives of the most vulnerable and marginalized members of society, \nincluding women, minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. The 11th FYP notes that \"being \nthe largest source of employment after agriculture, the MSME sector in India enables nearly 65 \nmillion men and women living in urban slums, upcoming towns, remote villages, and isolated \nhamlets to use indigenous knowledge, cultural wisdom, dexterous hands, and entrepreneurial \nskills for the sustenance of their lives and livelihoods.\"2 In addition to generating the highest \nemployment per capita investment, they also help check rural\u2013urban migration by providing \nvillagers and people living in isolated areas with sustainable sources of employment. For these \nreasons, a vibrant MSME sector has the potential to drive inclusive growth and job creation in \nIndia. Appendix 2 provides a more detailed analysis of the MSME sector in India.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n6.  The huge potential of India's MSME sector remains largely untapped, however, as a \nresult  of  several  systemic  constraints.  While  each  segment  of  the  MSME  sector\u2014\nmicroenterprises, small companies, and medium-sized firms\u2014has its own niche, challenges, \nand opportunities, some generic problems need to be addressed, including most importantly the \ndifficulty MSMEs face in accessing adequate and timely financing, and particularly longer-tenor \nloans, on competitive terms. These problems have been exacerbated by the current global \nfinancial crisis and the resultant liquidity constraints for longer-tenor funds in the Indian financial \nsector, with the result that MSMEs face even greater constraints in accessing adequate finance. \n \nC.  Impact of the Global Financial Crisis \n \n7.  India was affected by the global credit crisis, albeit to a lesser extent than many other \nemerging economies. External commercial borrowing and short-term credit from abroad, which \nmet more than 20% of corporate India\u2019s credit needs in FY2007, contributed only 8.2% of the \nfinancing needs in FY2008. Although commercial bank credit increased by $7.7 billion, this \nfailed to meet shortfall left by other domestic and foreign sources, which fell by $26.4 billion. \nMSMEs faced even greater problems accessing adequate financing following the credit crisis \nthan the constrained financing experienced by India's corporate sector;3 during the peak of the \ncredit crunch, MSMEs were even being denied overdraft facilities by banks. \n                                                 \n2  Government of India. 2007.

Dealing with the Impact of Global Financial Crisis\u2014MSME \nAgenda for Indian Economy. New Delhi (8 December) included the findings of a recent survey on the impact of the \ncurrent economic crisis. The survey, conducted during November 2008 by the Confederation of Indian Industry \namong MSMEs located in the northern region of India, found that (i) the crisis appears to have impacted MSMEs \nmore than larger companies in all areas, including profitability, credit availability, and lengthened payment cycles; \n(ii)  employment  in  MSMEs  has  been  impacted,  with  21.1%  of  responding  MSMEs  reporting  a  decline  in \nemployment on 8 November (versus 13.5% of large organizations); (iii) 8.3% of MSME respondents indicated \nbusiness closures may result if the slowdown continued for another 6 months; (iv) sales declines deepened in \nNovember 2008, compared to April 2008\u2013September 2008; (v) a significant number of respondents (45.5%) \nreported a decline in margins due to foreign exchange fluctuations, highlighting the need for a stable foreign \nexchange environment; (vi) 72% of respondents reported that payment cycles have become longer; and (vii) 78% \nof MSMEs felt the recovery would occur in December 2009 or later, indicating expectations of a difficult 2009 for \nthe Indian industry. ", "  3\nD.  Impact of the Financial Crisis on Female Microentrepreneurs \n \n8.  Entrepreneurs who have grown from being petty traders and have reached the \u201cmissing \nmiddle\u201d  segment,  where  they  are  poised  for  growth,  have  particularly  suffered  during  the \nfinancial crisis, with the gains that they had consolidated eroding. Evidence collected during the \nfact-finding mission and discussions with various agencies of the Government of India (the \nGovernment) agencies, the private sector and multilateral and bilateral donors indicates that the \nglobal  financial  crisis  has  worsened  the  already  acute  shortage  of  credit  available  to \nmicroentrepreneurs, who are predominantly women. A recent study conducted by the Self \nEmployed Women\u2019s Association in Ahmedabad, Gujarat shows that the income of poor informal \nsector workers has declined,4 due to the closure of various small-scale industries, and wage and \nworking hour reductions, resulting from the current financial crisis. There has been an impact on \nnutritional standards and health, increased livelihood insecurity, forced sales of household small \nassets, and a high level of migration. \n \nE.  Government of India's Response to the Financial Crisis \n \n9.  The Government implemented several monetary and fiscal stimulus measures to cope \nwith the crisis, such as tax cuts and incentives for the export, housing, and infrastructure \nsectors. To address the problem of credit squeeze and to ease bank access to finance and \npreserve  financial  stability,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  has  undertaken  a  number  of \nimportant measures, including: (i) phased lowering of key policy rates; (ii) injecting additional \nliquidity of more than $62 billion through the reduction of the cash reserve ratio from 5.5% to \n5%; (iii) cutting the repossessed rate by 425 basis points,5 and the reverse repossessed rate by \n275 basis points since September 2008; and (vi) reducing the statutory liquidity ratio by 100 \nbasis  point  to  24%.  In  light  of  sector  demands  and  to  meet  overall  growth  targets,  both \nGovernment and industry are requiring banks to lend more and charge less. However, to meet \nthe demands of the economy, banks have to mobilize costly bulk deposits to meet higher \ndemand.  While  banks  may  accommodate  the  demands  made  on  them,  there  are  also \ndisincentives to credit expansion across the portfolio spectrum.  \n \n10.  In response to the various policy measures adopted by the Government and RBI, the \nIndian economy has recently started showing early recovery signs as evidenced by several \nindicators. For instance, the index of industrial production has started registering growth since \nApril 2009. The intermediate goods sector and the consumer durable industry have recorded \nrelatively sharp growth, indicating revival in demand in the economy. More importantly, certain \nsectors like cement and steel, backed by renewed and expected infrastructure investments, and \nincreasing demand in rural and semiurban housing construction have began to gain growth \nmomentum. \n \n11.  In late October 2009, RBI began the first phase of its exit from expansionary policy by \nending  some  liquidity  support  measures  undertaken  in  2008,  but  left  key  policy  rates \nunchanged. For instance, a special repurchase facility for banks and another for the funding \nneeds of nonbank financial companies, mutual funds, and housing finance companies was \nended. RBI also raised the statutory liquidity ratio of commercial banks to 25% from 24%. \n \n                                                 \n4  Self Employed Women\u2019s Association, 2009.

Government  of  India\u2019s  Strategy  for  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  \n \n12.  The promotion and development of the MSME sector in India is a key component in \nIndia's overall industrialization policy. In recent years, the Government has devised policies for \nfacilitating increased credit flow to MSMEs under various priority sector lending programs. \nUnder these policies, banks are required to ensure that a defined percentage (currently 40%) of \ntheir overall lending is targeted to priority sectors, as classified by the Government (priority \nsectors include agriculture, small industries, and exports).  \n \n13.  Several committees have been constituted to increase the credit flow to MSMEs. The \nNayak  Committee  (FY1991\u2013FY1992)  set  up  by  RBI  dealt  with  aspects  of  adequacy  and \ntimeliness of credit to MSMEs. The Committee estimated that MSMEs were obtaining working \ncapital to the extent of 8.1% (FY2005 and FY2006) of the sector\u2019s annual output, which was \nless than the standard requirement of 20%, and recommended the MSME sector should obtain \n20% of its annual projected turnover by way of working capital.6 The Ganguly Committee \n(FY2004) emphasized the need for new vehicles and instruments such as credit intermediaries \ndedicated to MSME and trade financing. Such credit intermediaries would be designed to \nabsorb credit risk and serve as instruments for extending quick credit to the clusters accredited \nto MSMEs (including export clusters).7  \n \n14.  Following  the  recommendations  of  these  committees,  the  Government  undertook \nseveral initiatives, including delinking SIDBI from the Industrial Development Bank of India, \nopening specialized branches for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending,8 increasing \nthe limits of composite loans from Rs0.2 million to Rs0.5 million, setting up debt recovery \ntribunals, introducing a credit guarantee scheme, and raising the exemption limit for collateral \nsecurity from Rs25,000 to Rs0.5 million. Furthermore, the internal group to review the guidelines \nof credit flow to the SME sector set up by RBI recommended self-set targets for the commercial \nbanks for the SME sector, with yearly increases in disbursements. In his statement in the Rajya \nSabha  (upper  house  of  Parliament)  on  10  August  2005,  the  Finance  Minister  proposed \nimplementing the recommendations of the internal group, and established a minimum of 20% \ngrowth in credit to the SME sector, enabling the flow of credit to this sector to be doubled, from \nRs676 billion ($16.6 billion) in FY2004\u2013FY2005 to Rs1,350 billion ($33.12 billion) by FY2009\u2013\nFY2010. Nevertheless, SMEs accounted for just 8.1% of bank credit by the end of FY2007.  \n \n15.  On 6 June 2007, a group comprising representatives from the Government\u2019s Department \nof  Commerce,  commercial  banks,  SIDBI,  trade  bodies,  and  three  RBI  departments  was \nconstituted under the chairmanship of an executive director of India Exim Bank to assess the \ncredit requirements of exporters in the MSME sector. After detailed deliberations and interactive \nsessions on the issue with MSME exporters through trade bodies, the group recommended that \nthe earmarking of 50% of export credit for the MSME sector was a desirable target for all banks \n(including foreign banks). RBI could provide banks having a smaller-than-desired MSME export \ncredit portfolio with a timeframe (on an individual basis) to achieve the proposed level. The \n                                                 \n6  The Kapur Committee (1997) set up by RBI reviewed the delivery system of working capital and recommended that \nsmall-scale industry (SSI) businesses should receive a minimum of 20% of their value of output. \n7  It was also recommended that novel funding schemes for SMEs be introduced, especially in eastern and other less \ndeveloped regions, to remove regional imbalances by promoting and developing SMEs. \n8  Public sector banks have been advised to establish more specialized small-scale industry (SSI) branches at \ncenters where there is a potential for financing many SSI borrowers. With a view to moderating the cost of credit to \nSSI businesses, banks have been advised to give SSI businesses with a good track record the benefit of lower \nspreads over the prime lending rate. ", "  5\nreport has been forwarded to the Government by RBI. Suitable guidelines will be issued by RBI \nfollowing government approval.  \n \nG.  Financial Sector Landscape for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in India \n \n16.  Traditionally, commercial banks have been the main providers of finance to the MSME \nsector in India. Indian commercial banks can be divided into two distinct groups: \n \n(i)  Public sector banks. These banks account for most lending to MSMEs in India, \nand have a long history of support to small businesses. A key challenge facing \nthese banks is to continue (and further expand) MSME lending while improving \nthe quality of loans to MSMEs. \n \n(ii)  New  private  sector  banks.  Established  about  15  years  ago  (and  including \nforeign banks, especially Citibank and HSBC), the new private sector banks view \nMSME lending as a profitable business, and lend to MSMEs in order to cross-sell \nfee-based products, while taking advantage of noninterest-bearing deposits from \nMSMEs. However, they have clearly been very selective and cautious in their \nMSME lending, and account for less than 10% of all lending to MSMEs. Some of \nthe new private sector banks report very low rates of nonperforming loans (NPLs) \n(as low as 1% of the total MSME portfolio). An important challenge facing the \nprivate sector banks is to expand lending to MSMEs while maintaining their \nrecord of good loan quality. \n \n1.  Commercial  Bank  Lending  to  the  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprise \nSector \n \n17.  Table 2 below shows the bank credit outstanding by the commercial banks to the MSME \nsector. The total outstanding credit provided to the MSME sector as of the end of March 2007 \nwas Rs1,047 billion ($21.8 billion), constituting 8.0% of net bank credit and 24.4% of their total \npriority sector loans. The proportion of MSME loans to net bank credit has been declining over \nthe last 10 years, from approximately 15% to about 8%, due to a shift in focus by commercial \nbanks to other more profitable and less labor-intensive areas, such as consumer finance and \nreal estate lending. \n \nTable 2: Bank Credit Outstanding by Commercial Banks to the Micro, Small, and Medium \nEnterprise Sector \n(Rs million)  \n \n  Net Bank  Annual Growth  Credit to  Annual Growth  Credit to MSME of \nFiscal Year  Credit  (%)  MSME  (%)  Net Bank Credit (%) \n1996\u20131997  2,459,990  17.89  381,960  11.40  15.5 \n1997\u20131998  2,972,650  21.20  457,710  19.60  15.4 \n1998\u20131999  3,394,770  14.14  516,790  12.66  15.2 \n1999\u20132000  3,982,050  17.40  570,350  10.46  14.3 \n2000\u20132001  4,672,060  17.33  601,410  5.43  12.9 \n2001\u20132002  5,350,630  14.56  671,070  11.65  12.5 \n2002\u20132003  6,685,760  25.04  647,070   (-)3.60   9.7 \n2003\u20132004  7,638,550  14.20  712,090  10.04  9.3 \n2004\u20132005  9,718,090  27.22  831,790  16.71  8.6 \n2005\u20132006  1,0176,140  39.38  824,920  8.50  8.1 \n ", "6  \n  Net Bank  Annual Growth  Credit to  Annual Growth  Credit to MSME of \nFiscal Year  Credit  (%)  MSME  (%)  Net Bank Credit (%) \n2006\u20132007  13,177,050  0.00  1,047,030  0.00  8.0 \nMSME = micro, small, and medium enterprise. \nNote: See Supplementary Appendix A for further information on the banking sector in India. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India. \n \n2.  Cluster and Linkage Financing \n \n18.  Both public and private sector banks have started to adopt a combination of \u201ccluster \nfinancing\u201d (MSME portfolios are concentrated in terms of MSME geographical and sectoral \nclusters, with some 60 clusters identified by the Government) and \u201clinkage financing\u201d (lending to \nMSMEs that are suppliers to larger corporate entities), with MSMEs that are not part of clusters \nor not linked to larger firms having a very low chance of receiving financing. Financial access is \npoor even for MSMEs within clusters or those linked to larger corporations. \n \n3.  Microfinance Institutions \n \n19.  In  the  last  20  years  finance  has  also  been  supplied\u2014especially  to  the  smallest \nMSMEs\u2014through specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs). This effort has been led by the \nSIDBI Foundation for Microcredit (SFMC), SIDBI, and other apex lending institutions, including \nthe National Credit Fund for Women (Rashtriya Mahila Kosh), which are responsible for much of \nthe growth of the sector. SFMC and SIDBI are the largest players, and introduced a number of \ninnovations, including mainstreaming the microfinance sector, facilitating links to commercial \nbanks  and  lenders,  promoting  better  practices  among  MFIs  through  its  capacity  building \nprogram, and pioneering support to rating initiatives and new instruments (including the recently \nlaunched transformation loan and quasi-equity product). These initiatives have helped the MFI \nsector grow rapidly over the last few years, but with a few exceptions, most of the initiatives are \nsmall and region-specific, and have limited collective outreach. Some MFIs are based on the \nGrameen model. Others promote and establish financial links with self-help groups (SHGs). The \nMFIs offer some of the features of the informal sector\u2014such as flexible products and customer-\nfriendly practices\u2014but at higher interest rates than the formal sector, while introducing some \nfeatures of formal institutions, such as documented loan contracts, detailed books of accounts, \nmanagement  information  systems,  staff,  and  some  degree  of  supervision  by  a  regulatory \nauthority. \n \n20.  Precise data about the Indian MFI sector are difficult to obtain. Information from the \nNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development indicates that 334 MFIs had availed \nRs11.5 billion (around $240 million) of loans from the banking system, and the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development had Rs15.8 billion (around $330 million) in outstanding \nloans to 550 MFIs in FY2008.9 As of 31 March 2008, it is estimated that (i) the MFI sector in \nIndia,  through  its  two  major  channels\u2014the  SHG-Bank  Linkage  Programme  (SBLP)10 and \nMFIs\u2014served over 33 million Indians, up by 9 million over the previous year; and (ii) 4 out of 5 \nmicrofinance clients in India are women, and 8 out of 10 MFI clients have been provided with \nloans of less than Rs10,000 (around $208). Loan of Rs5,000 ($104) to Rs10,000 ($208) showed \nthe strongest growth, which can be explained by two main factors: (i) microfinance customers \nmature to larger loans over the loan cycles, and (ii) urban microfinance starts with comparatively \nlarger loans than rural finance.   \n                                                 \n9  Available: http://www.indiamicrofinance.com/wp-ontent/uploads/2009/08/state_of_the_sector_report_2008.pdf.  \n10 The self-help group bank linkage programme (SBLP) is spearheaded and implemented by the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development. ", "  7\n21.  During FY2008, the outstanding microcredit portfolio of the Indian MFI sector grew by \nabout 70%, reaching close to Rs222 billion ($4.6 billion). The strongest growth was reported by \nmedium-sized (often urban) and large MFIs. SBLP accounted for 75%, while 20% were large \nMFIs and 5% medium-sized and small MFIs. SBLP reports over Rs35 billion ($730 million) in \nsavings of SHG members. MFIs are prohibited from accepting savings, but one third of their \nclients are served under the SHG model and, thus encouraged to save among themselves \nand/or open savings accounts with banks.

Description of the Small Industries Development Bank of India \n  \n22.  SIDBI was established in April 1990 by the SIDBI Act of India 1989 as a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of the Industrial Development Bank of India. SIDBI was created to act as the principal \nfinancial institution for promoting, financing, and developing the MSME sector. SIDBI provides \nindirect  assistance  to  MSMEs  through  refinancing  primary  lending  institutions,  such  as \ncommercial  banks,  state  finance  companies  (SFCs),  and  state  industrial  development \ncorporations. It also provides direct support to MSMEs through term loans, bill discounting, and \npre- and post-shipment credit. Appendix 3 contains the financial management assessment and \ndetails on SIDBI\u2019s operations, subsidiaries, strategy, and financial performance.  \n \n23.  Currently, SIDBI is owned by the Industrial Development Bank of India and by other \npublic entities and financial institutions. Among the other large shareholders are the State Bank \nof  India,  the  largest  bank  in  India,  and  the  Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  India.  SIDBI  is \nheadquartered in Lucknow and has 100 branches across India. SIDBI has received the highest \ndomestic  rating  by  all  three  primary  Indian  rating  agencies\u2014Credit  Analysis  &  Research \n(CARE), ICRA Limited, and CRISIL Ltd. \n \n24.  SIDBI\u2019s main corporate initiative over the last few years has been to increase its focus \non direct lending. Although SIDBI\u2019s refinancing activities (indirect assistance) have traditionally \nrepresented the largest portion of its total loan portfolio\u2014about 64% as of the end of FY2009\u2014it \nhas placed greater emphasis on expanding its direct assistance portfolio over the past 3 years.  \n \n25.  SIDBI has shifted toward direct financing in response to several factors. First, SFCs, \nwhich were traditionally one of the main borrowers from SIDBI under its refinancing window, are \nexperiencing financial weaknesses. Unable to adjust to the liberalization of the industrial and \nfinancial sectors, the delisting of protected manufactured goods, and the reduction in tariff \nbarriers, the financial position of the 18 SFCs in India deteriorated significantly during the 1990s. \n ", "8  \nAlthough it is actively working on restructuring plans with most SFCs,11 SIDBI has decided to \nreduce its overall exposure to these institutions. The second factor contributing to SIDBI\u2019s shift \ntoward direct lending is that the demand for refinancing from commercial banks has been \ninconsistent due to changes in market liquidity. Finally, SIDBI\u2019s policy is to provide better \nservices for MSMEs in more remote rural areas.  \n \n26.  During  FY2009,  SIDBI  recorded  significantly  better  operational  performance  and \nstrengthened its financial fundamentals. Both loan approvals and disbursements reached record \nhighs;  approvals  increased  by  83%,  reaching  Rs295.43  billion  ($6.2  billion),  while \ndisbursements increased by 83%, reaching Rs282.02 billion ($5.9 billion), and benefiting more \nthan 680,000 MSMEs. While refinance support, which is a key function of SIDBI, was enhanced \nby 38%, direct credit flows to MSMEs by SIDBI increased by 57%. The aggregate outstanding \nportfolio of the bank surpassed Rs300 billion ($6.3 billion) for the first time, increasing by 54% to \nRs307.89 billion ($6.4 billion) as of 31 March 2009. As a result, the total assets of the bank \nincreased substantially to Rs345.91 billion ($7.2 billion). During FY2009, SIDBI's net profit \nincreased by 48% to Rs3.02 billion ($63 million), from Rs2.04 billion ($43 million). SIDBI has a \ncomfortable capital adequacy ratio of 40.7% and a very low net nonperforming asset ratio \n0.25%. \n \n27.  Following its expanded mandate to increase the level of microcredit available to the rural \npoor, in 1999 SIDBI set up a specialized department for microcredit (the SFMC) with the \nobjective of creating a national network of sustainable MFIs that cater to the poor. SFMC is an \napex wholesale financial institution for microfinance in India with a complete range of financial \nproducts such as loans, grants, equity investments, etc. In conjunction with the Department for \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  SIDBI  has  launched  a  National \nMicrofinance Programme. It has also developed new loan products, such as direct credit for \nmicrofinance  clients  and  introduced  syndicated  credit  arrangements  for  microfinance \ninstitutions, and capacity building products. It has helped more than 7 million poor people, \nmainly women, through over 130 active partner MFIs under these programs. The cumulative \nloan approvals under SIDBI's microfinance window during FY2009 surged by 84% to Rs42.64 \nbillion ($890 million), and disbursements increased by almost 100% to Rs33.56 billion ($700 \nmillion). Microcredit outstanding as of 31 March 2009 was Rs21.06 billion ($439 million).  \n \nI.  Linkage with the Country's Development Priorities \n \n28.  As discussed in paragraphs 2 and 5, as well in Appendix 2, support for the MSME sector \nhas been a critical element in all of India's five year plans, including the ongoing 11th FYP. The \nproposed Project is therefore, strongly aligned with India's development priorities. It is also in \nline with the poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which states that \nADB should promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and capital markets\u201d since these are \nseen as \u201cbeing indispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and ensuring \navailability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth.\u201d12 \n  \n                                                 \n11 SIDBI has currently signed memorandums of understanding with 11 SFCs to provide them with (i) human resource \ncapacity development, (ii) grants for the upgrading of their information technology systems, and (iii) rollout of a \ncentralized computer system among all SFCs. During FY2008, eight SFCs registered a profit, and SIDBI was able \nto recover more than 90% of its outstanding assets from the SFCs. \n12 ADB. 1999. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy. Manila (p. 29). ", "  9\n29.  Moreover,  in  line  with  Strategy  2020,13 which  emphasizes  the  need  to  scale  up \nnonsovereign operations (NSOs), this project utilizes an NSO modality to develop a bankable \nproject structure that can become a model for using resources mobilized in international capital \nmarkets to increase lending to the MSME sector in India.  \n \n30.  ADB developed the Project in response to requests for financing from the Government, \nSIDBI, and Indian public sector commercial banks to support efforts to remove constraints to \nMSME access to finance, and to foster SME development, especially to address some of the \nadverse impacts of the ongoing global financial crisis on the MSME sector in India. The Project \nwill improve MSME access to finance and capacity building activities, and foster MSME growth, \ncompetitiveness and employment.  \n \nJ.  Lessons Learned \n \n31.  The project design fully reflects lessons from recent analytical work on MSMEs, ongoing \nand  completed  projects  by  ADB  and  other  donors  active  in  the  MSME  sector  in  India,14 \ninternational best practice in the area of MSME finance, and past experience with (i) refinancing \noperations involving credit lines, (ii) PCG facilities established by ADB and other multilateral \nbanks  (as  is  being  proposed  under  the  PCG  facility),15 and  (iii)  technical  assistance  (TA) \nprograms.  \n \n32.  An analysis of credit lines by the ADB Operations Evaluation Department highlights that \n(i) the domestic market for long-term funds for MSMEs is underdeveloped, (ii) appropriate \nselection of effective private sector banks and selective use of performance-oriented state-\nowned banks are key to efficient delivery of MSME subloans, and (iii) using market-based \nonlending rates to MSMEs is more effective than subsidized credit.16  \n \n33.  The design of the proposed Project also incorporates important recommendations made \nby  a  special  evaluation  study  update  on  financial  intermediation  support  by  the  ADB \nIndependent Evaluation Department,17 and a best-practices note on MSME support by the ADB \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department.18 Both studies emphasize the need to \nadopt a three-pronged program, with mutually complementary elements, in order to build a \nstrong foundation for efficient and effective MSME financial intermediation. The program needs \nto (i) create a conducive policy and regulatory framework to ease constraints on MSME finance \nand private sector development; (ii) develop a broad-based, competitive, and efficient financial \nsector to provide entrepreneurs with alternative sources of investment capital, a diversified \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n14 ADB's last project in the MSME sector in India was the Small and Medium Enterprise Trade Finance Development \nFacility approved by the ADB Board on 30 September 2009. The project consists of an NSO loan of $100 million \nand a TA grant of $900,000 to the Export\u2013Import Bank of India.  \n15 ADB has established so far two PCG facilities in connection with SME support projects, namely: (i) ADB. 2005. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan, Partial Credit \nGuarantee, and Equity Investment to the Republic of the Philippines for the Small and Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment Support Project. Manila (Loan 2186-PHI approved 29 September for $25 million); and (ii) ADB. 2003. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans, Guarantee, and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (Loan 2066-PAK approved 19 December for $152 million). Both interventions \nincorporated a PCG facility in the design with the aim to partially guarantee the SME loan portfolios of participating \nbanks. \n16 ADB. 2005. Annual Evaluation Review. Manila. \n17 ADB. 2008. Support for Financial Intermediation in Developing Member Countries. Manila. \n18 ADB. 2006. Best Practice Notes on Small- and Medium Enterprises Support. Manila. \n ", "1 0 \nselection of new and innovative products, competitive rates, and efficient services to make their \ninvestments  viable;  and  (iii)  promote  MSME  support  services  such  as  skills,  trades, \nentrepreneurship, and other business development services (BDSs).  \n \n34.  These lessons have been incorporated into the design of the proposed intervention, \nnotably (i) the existing financial sector landscape in India for the MSME sector has been \ncarefully analyzed to identify gaps and constraints that will be addressed through the proposed \nADB intervention (i.e., providing funding to the \"missing middle\" borrower segment); (ii) the \nproposed Project takes into account the ongoing MSME support programs of the other donors in \nIndia in order to avoid any duplication or crowding-out effects; (iii) participating banks under the \nPCG facility will be selected through a comprehensive due diligence process; (iv) the structure \nof the PCG facility has been designed to maximize leverage impact and will be operated and \npriced  on  a  commercial  basis;  (v)  SIDBI  is  strongly  committed  to  the  project,  has  good \nmanagement capacity, substantial experience in the MSME sector in India and a large branch \nnetwork; and (vi) demand aspects have been thoroughly examined and participating banks (as \nwell as SIDBI) have confirmed a pipeline of bankable MSME subprojects that would benefit from \nthe intervention. \n \n35.  The companion capacity building grant (CBG), currently under consideration by the \nGovernment of Japan (GOJ), incorporates lessons from international best practice, including \nthat microenterprise promotion requires other inputs in addition to microcredit, such as the (i) \nidentification of livelihood opportunities; (ii) selection and motivation of the microentrepreneurs; \n(iii) provision of financial literacy, business development and other technical training; and (iv) \nestablishment  of  market  linkages  for  inputs  and  outputs.  In  the  absence  of  these  inputs, \nmicrocredit alone works only for a limited set of activities\u2014small farming, livestock rearing, and \npetty trading\u2014and even then, only if market linkages are in place. In this context, developing the \nskills and self-confidence of women entrepreneurs to operate and survive in the informal sector \nis critical. Furthermore, well-designed and suitably delivered training can lead to increased \nincome,  higher  self-esteem  and  improved  status  in  the  household  and  community.  A \nmanagement information system will be put in place to monitor the social and gender results of \nthe CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ.  \n \nK.  Donor Coordination \n \n36.  Several donors have been actively supporting the MSME sector in India for the past \nseveral years (the external donor coordination matrix is in Appendix 4). All donors involved in \nthe MSME sector are carefully coordinating their activities to ensure that no overlaps exist. \nMeetings among all these organizations are held regularly to harmonize all activities. ADB will \njoin those meetings. The largest of these programs is the World Bank-led multidonor Small and \nMedium Enterprise Financing and Development Project for $120 million, which was approved in \n2004. The project aimed to improve access of SMEs to finance (including term finance) and \nBDSs. Its three main outputs were a credit facility extended to SIDBI, a risk-sharing facility, and \na policy and institutional development TA program. DFID and German development cooperation \nthrough the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and KfW provided substantial \ngrant assistance to reinforce the capacity development and institutional reform components of \nthe project. For example, the DFID-funded TA has supported the creation of a credit bureau and \nan SME rating agency, and helped in building capacity at SIDBI. Given the good performance of \nthe project, the World Bank approved an additional $400 million in supplementary assistance in \nApril 2009 to extend the project to more states. The World Bank is currently also processing a \n$300 million loan to assist the microfinance sector in India.  \n ", " 11\n37.  Over the years, the Japan International Cooperation Agency has extended six credit \nlines to SIDBI amounting to nearly $2 billion for onlending to the MSME sector. The present \nMicro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Energy Saving Project provides a line of credit of $300 \nmillion to SIDBI to encourage MSMEs to undertake energy saving investments in plant and \nmachinery and production processes, which would enhance energy efficiency, lower carbon \ndioxide emissions, and improve their long-term profitability. Other donors (e.g., KfW and GTZ) \nhave also recently established projects that seek to enhance the energy efficiency of MSMEs.  \n \n38.  The  United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO)  has  focused  on \nraising the competitiveness of industrial enterprises, especially MSMEs, through industrial policy \nadvice, investment, and technology promotion, with a view to increasing productivity, quality, \nenergy efficiency, and environmental sustainability. The UNIDO consolidated project for SME \ndevelopment in India combines traditional UNIDO approaches\u2014such as cluster development, \ninvestment and technology promotion\u2014with innovative credit delivery mechanisms for SMEs, \nsuch as mutual credit guarantee schemes, private equity and venture capital. \n \n39.  The International Finance Corporation has been helping the private sector, including \nMSMEs, through its various business lines that focus on (i) lending to and investing in various \nMSMEs, (ii) creating an enabling environment, (iii) providing corporate advice, (iv) infrastructure \nand environment, and (v) social sustainability. Its most recent initiative provides a combination \nof  equity-like  financing,  business  mentoring,  and  capacity  building  support  for  the  BYST \n(Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust) Growth Fund, a small private equity fund of $5 million, which will \nassist socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs in the micro and small enterprise (MSE) sector.  \n \n40.  Although several donor partners in India are actively assisting the MSME sector, this \nADB  operation  has  been  carefully  deigned  to  avoid  duplication  and  add  value.  First,  the \nfinancing  and  other  needs  of  SMEs  (and  microenterprises)  in  India  is  huge,  and  the \nGovernment's programs require more support than they now receive from the donor community, \nespecially given the current credit crisis. The proposed ADB PCG would help commercial banks \ntap the international bond market, and use those resources to indirectly enhance lending to their \nMSME clients in India. Second, ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan would enable \nSIDBI to extend its credit and BDSs to the \"missing middle\" borrower segment, which is not the \ndirect  focus  of  any  current  donor-supported  projects.  Third,  although  women  constitute  a \nsizeable proportion of the beneficiaries of existing donor assistance that reaches MSME clients, \nmere access to credit may be insufficient to ensure that female recipients are able to cope with \nnumerous other gender-related constraints they face, and actually establish enterprises that are \nproductive and sustainable. The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) CBG, currently \nunder consideration by the GOJ, which would accompany and support the Project, will directly \nhelp (i) train MSEs led by women, (ii) strengthen the gender-related policies and programs of \nSIDBI,  (iii)  develop  and  pilot-test  innovative  financial  solutions  for  poor  women,  and  (iv) \nestablish a monitoring and evaluation system to assess the social and gender results of the \nactivities to be supported under the ADB Project. The existing donor programs for MSMEs and \nSIDBI's programs lack such a targeted output that addresses gender issues. \n \n41.  ADB will continue to harmonize its activities with those of donor partners through its \ninteractions with SIDBI. If required, the provision of additional capacity building assistance for \nSIDBI or other donors will be considered. Many of the procedures pertaining to safeguards and \nprocurement established by SIDBI with other donors partners would be followed by ADB, after \nthe required due diligence. Inputs of donor partners will also be taken into account while \ndesigning and conducting the proposed baseline survey and rigorous impact evaluation of the \nCBG,  currently  under  consideration  by  the  GOJ,  which  will  focus  on  finance  and  training \n ", "1 2 \nprograms for women entrepreneurs. Workshops will be organized to share the findings of this \nevaluation with all stakeholders, including the Government, donor partners, and civil society.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n42.  The impact of the proposed Project is to help MSMEs in India realize their full potential, \nthereby  assisting  domestic  MSMEs  in  India,  in  conjunction  with  the  JFPR-financed  CBG, \ncurrently under consideration by the GOJ, to be fully developed, particularly those led by female \nmicroentrepreneurs. The specific and immediate expected outcome of the Project is improved \nMSME access to commercial financing, capacity building services and market opportunities, \nthereby fostering MSME growth, competitiveness, and employment creation. \n \n43.  The  objective  of  the  proposed  Project  is  to improve  MSME  access  to  finance  and \nbusiness  development  services,  thereby  fostering  MSME  growth,  competitiveness,  and \nemployment  creation,  which  are  key  to  achieving  the  Government's  overall  objectives  of \ninclusive  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  is  designed  to  achieve  this \nobjective through a multipronged approach that will address key bottlenecks to MSME financing \nand development in India by focusing on: (i) helping commercial public sector banks, which are \nthe  main  credit  providers  to  the  MSME  sector  in  India,  gain  better  access  to  longer-term \nfinancing for lending to MSMEs in the country; (ii) providing financing (through SIDBI) to the \n\"missing middle\" borrower segment, composed of microfinance borrowers that have grown too \nlarge for financial support from MFIs, but remain unable to access bank financing because they \nare (a) still considered  not creditworthy, and (b) operate primarily in the informal sector; and (iii) \nstrengthening capacity building and BDS and market linkage programs for microenterprises \nprimarily led by women entrepreneurs, thereby improving their profitability, competitiveness, and \ncreditworthiness. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n44.  The design of the Project builds on consultations with all stakeholders, including the \nGovernment and SIDBI. The Project is divided into two main outputs, with different target \ngroups and objectives. Output A will be the establishment of a PCG facility of up to $250 million, \nwithout  government  counterindemnity,  to  assist  one  or  more  participating  banks  with  a \nsubstantial MSME business and significant operational presence in India in raising long-tenor \nfunding in the international capital markets via a loan or bond with a tenor of 5 years (maximum \nof 10 years, on a strictly exceptional basis), which would be partially guaranteed by ADB. Output \nB will use ADB\u2019s loan of $50 million to provide dollar financing to SIDBI to support the so-called \n\u201cmissing middle\u201d through specific financing programs through its direct and indirect lending \noperations. In addition, there will be a CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, of up to \n$3 million from the JFPR to help enhance the capacity of female entrepreneurs and women\u2019s \nassociations to more systematically access the financial resources that will be made available, \nparticularly under the proposed SIDBI loan. The project design is provided in Appendix 5. \n \n1.  Output A: Partial Credit Guarantee Facility \n \n45.  The  proposed  PCG  facility  of  up  to  $250  million,  without  a  Government \ncounterguarantee, will assist participating banks in raising medium- and long-term funding from ", " 13\nthe international capital markets, which will enable them to provide credit lines to their MSME19 \nclients in selected states (to be agreed with ADB) in India on market-based terms. The facility \nwill be made available to one or more participating banks in India that have experience in the \nMSME sector and an extensive branch network.20 Appendix 6 has further information on the \nproposed PCG facility. \n \n46.  Under the proposed facility, ADB would assist participating banks in raising long-tenor \nfunding by credit enhancing either a loan to or a bond issued by each participating bank. The \nmaximum guaranteed amount of each underlying debt instrument enhanced with a PCG from \nADB will be the lower of $250 million or 50% of the net worth of the relevant participating bank, \nand will be structured so that ADB's total exposure to the instrument will not exceed the ADB \nsingle exposure limit for nonsovereign operations of $250 million equivalent.21  \n \n47.  In the event a PCG is used to credit enhance a loan, the guaranteed loan will be subject \nto conditions precedent to disbursements, including all necessary government and shareholder \napprovals and consents, and all contractual and financial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \nThe loan agreement will include appropriate (i) representations and warranties; (ii) covenants, \nincluding affirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events of default, \nconsistent with ADB's requirements and with certain default triggers and rights reserved for ADB \nto exercise. \n \n48.  In the event a PCG is used to credit enhance a bond, the bond will be issued as a public \noffering in the international capital markets, or as a private placement. The PCG is expected to \nraise the rating of the bond by up to 2 to 3 levels.22 The resulting maximum credit-enhanced \ninternational credit rating will be capped at A+. The bond enhancement needs to be seen in the \ncontext  of  the  current  status  of  the  international  bond  markets.  These  markets  have  only \nrecently started to open up for NSO borrowers from ADB developing member countries. Since \nthe emergence of the liquidity crisis, State Bank of India and Export-Import Bank of India have \nbeen  the  only  Indian  borrowers  that  have  been  able  to  issue  international  bonds.  The \nenhancement will provide attractive financing terms to the participating banks in the form of \nsubstantial annual savings in interest costs and longer tenors. Moreover, the enhanced credit \nrating  will  allow  participation  of  international  investors  that  would  not  have  been  able  to \npurchase  the  bond  without  enhancement  due  to  rating  constrictions  or  other  credit  risk \nconsiderations. Therefore, the PCG is expected to widen the investor base of participating \nbanks.  \n \n49.  A PCG used to credit enhance a bond will be structured pursuant to discussions with the \nrelevant participating banks, the arranger of the bonds, and the credit rating agencies, with a \nview to meeting the issuer, investor, and target credit rating requirements, and will be subject to \ndetailed review by ADB Management and its Investment Committee. In this context, PCGs may, \ninter alia, be used to (i) cover all or a portion of principal repayment or a predefined combination \n                                                 \n19 The MSME definition from the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act (2006) will apply. \n20 The PCG facility will be made available on a first-come, first-served basis. So far, the following Indian public sector \ncommercial banks have indicated their interest in a PCG from ADB: (i) Bank of Baroda, (ii) Bank of India, (iii) Exim \nBank of India, (iv) IDBI Bank, (v) Punjab National Bank, (vi) State Bank of India, (vii) SIDBI, and (viii) Union Bank of \nIndia. \n21 ADB. 2009. Review of the Asian Development Bank's Exposure Limits on Nonsovereign Operations. Manila. \nConsistent with the approach prescribed by ADB's policy for PCGs, the limit for the guaranteed amount will be \ncalculated on a net present value basis. \n22 All of the public sector commercial banks that have indicated preliminary interest in the facility currently have an \ninternational credit rating of BBB-, which is at par with the sovereign rating of India. The only exception is IDBI, \nwhich is rated one notch above the sovereign. \n ", "1 4 \nof principal and certain identified coupon repayments on a straight bond, 23 (ii) enhance a \nstructured bond such as a convertible bond or a bond with a buy-back obligation, and (iii) only \nbecome effective in the event of a sovereign credit rating downgrade.24 The final PCG structure \nwill take into account the various structures available in the market, pricing, and tenor benefits to \nthe issuer, and will be subject to final approval by the investment committee. \n \n50.  Use of proceeds. The guaranteed loan or bond will assist participating banks increase \ntheir commercially priced MSME loan portfolio. Loans will be provided to MSMEs in foreign \ncurrencies and/or rupees. Foreign currency financing will be available only for MSMEs with \nexport-based businesses. As the funds provided through the enhanced bond or loan will be in \nforeign currencies, each participating bank will manage the foreign exchange risk in accordance \nwith its foreign exchange risk policy, which will be carefully reviewed by ADB during due \ndiligence. The participating bank will be required to demonstrate to ADB an increase in their \nMSME portfolio in the selected states in an amount at least equal to the proceeds that will be \nraised through the ADB-enhanced transaction. \n \n51.  Eligibility. ADB will carry out a thorough due diligence on each public sector commercial \nbank  interested  in  participating  in  the  PCG  facility.  The  due  diligence  will  be  conducted \naccording to a set of well-established criteria and procedures. \n \n52.  The following criteria will be used to determine commercial public sector bank eligibility \nfor  participation  in  the  PCG  facility:  (i)  maintenance  of  majority  government  ownership \nstructure;25 (ii) demonstrated track record in accessing the international debt market, with the \nexception of highly qualified first-time issuers; (iii) an international credit rating of minimum BB+ \nor a domestic rating of AA in the absence of an international rating; (iv) experience and outreach \nin the delivery of financial services to the MSME market; (v) marketing plans and capabilities to \ndevelop new MSME products, using the proceeds from the ADB-enhanced debt instrument; (vi) \nloan  origination  and  administration  capacities,  skills,  and  standards;  (vii)  overall  financial \nstanding as determined according to ADB\u2019s internal guidelines; (viii) management consent and \ncommitment  to  develop  and  implement  an  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS);  and  (ix)  a  net  NPL  ratio  of  not  more  than  3%  for  its  MSME  portfolio.  See \nSupplementary Appendix B for an overview of Indian commercial public sector banks under \nconsideration. \n                                                 \n23 Such a combination would exclude the scenario where the PCG covers all of the principal and coupon repayments \nof the bond, as the PCG provides only a partial guarantee.   \n24 Such a standby guarantee would become effective once the Indian sovereign is downgraded by one or more \nnotches. This addresses investor's concerns that India may be downgraded (Standard & Poor's and Fitch have \nplaced India on the negative watch list), which would trigger an automatic one notch downgrade of all subsovereign \nentities, such as most large Indian public sector banks, that are currently rated on par with the Indian sovereign. \nAfter such a downgrade, the bonds will become \"non-investment\" grade, in which case many international \ninstitutional investors would have to sell them at lower price levels. ADB's contingent guarantee could be tailored \nso that, once it becomes effective, the credit rating of the bond would remain at the same level, avoiding a \ndowngrade. Benefits of such a structure would be wider investor participation, a lower guaranteed amount, and \nlower ADB guarantee fee. \n25 A major premise in the extension of the PCG facility is that accredited participating banks in the program are all \npublic sector banks with a majority ownership by the government. Given the long-term nature of the guaranty \nfacility, it is key to ensure that the ownership profile will be substantially maintained during the life of the ADB \nfacility since the element of continuing government support is an important consideration in establishing this \nintervention. ADB will therefore engage in a dialogue with the relevant government ministries to discuss the \nGovernment's  intention  with  respect  to  its  majority ownership  in  these  participating  banks.  If  possible,  the \ncounterindemnity agreement will contain language to the effect that in case of a change of ownership, the parties \nwill negotiate a mutually agreeable remedial solution. Alternatively, the meeting minutes with a participating bank \nwill note assurances made by the latter that majority ownership will be maintained by the Government. ", " 15\n2.  Output B: Financing the \"Missing Middle\" \n \n53.  The proposed loan of $50 million, with a guarantee from the Government, will be used to \nprovide SIDBI with long-tenor funding to support the \u201cmissing middle\u201d of microenterprises in \ntargeted states26 in India through specific financing programs through its direct and indirect \nlending operations that complement the various financing schemes in place in India that target \neither the microfinance entities or the SME sector. Many poor individuals and households \noperating in the informal sectors are able to access the various microfinance programs and \nproviders operating in India, but those clients remain dependent on informal and noninstitutional \nsources of credit, and are not able to access more traditional sources of financing such as bank \ncredit. MFIs are able to reach the poor effectively mainly because they have designed products \nand channels that meet the needs of this segment of society. However, MFIs are less capable \nof supporting their clients once they reach a certain size, because a shortage of financial and \nhuman  resources  limits  MFI  outreach  in  comparison  with  that  of  mainstream  financial \ninstitutions.27 See Figure 1. \n \n \nFigure 1: Financial Services provid ed to the different segments of the\nMicro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Sector \n \n \nNumber of Private Sector Financial\n \nEmployees Profile Services\n \n \n \n \n \n100\u2013200 Medium enterprises\n \n5\u2013100 Small enterprises  \nTarget\n1\u20135 Micro-enterprises  \n1 Self-employment  \n  Number of Firms\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n \n \n54.  The microcredit model falls short when larger and riskier investments are needed and \ncash flows are not immediate. The typical social collateral and joint-liability group lending model \nof MFIs, where peer pressure effectively plays the role of collateral, does not work in the case of \nthe larger MFI clients. MFIs thus face difficulties in helping their clients grow into individual \nborrowers that operate in the more formal sector, who can access more conventional financial \nservices on the basis of their financial history, balance sheet strength, and track record.  \n \n55.  Financing programs to support this \"missing middle\"\u2014i.e., small borrowers who have \npotential and have performed well, but have grown too large for traditional microfinance support \nwhile remaining unable to access more conventional (bank) financing because they either \nremain not creditworthy, or lack the necessary skills, capacity, and experience\u2014are currently \n                                                 \n26 These  are  Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Bihar,  Jharkhand,  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Orissa, \nRajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. \n27 A 2008 study carried out by Rashtriya Mahila Kosh highlighted the fact that the typical amount approved by the \nRashtriya  Mahila  Kosh  scheme\u2014Rs25,000  (or  $521)  for  microenterprises  loans\u2014is  too  low  to  set  up  a \nmicroenterprise, and that most of the beneficiaries interviewed during the impact assessment had to borrow funds \nfrom relatives or moneylenders to set up their microenterprises. \n ", "1 6 \ninadequate. The proposed loan to SIDBI would provide commercial funding (through SIDBI) to \nmicro and small borrowers to provide them with financing in excess of what MFIs typically \nprovide, which will help them prepare to access more conventional (bank) financing in the \nfuture. Although, it is expected that the private sector will move to fill this gap over time, this is \ncurrently not happening to the extent necessary (Figure 2). \n \n \nFigure 2: \u201cThe Missing Middle\u201d\n \nFinance is available for large and micro businesses, but is limited for the small companies\n  in India\n \n \nCompany size Finance size and source\n \n  Large companies Amount of finance  Rs50 million\n>201 employees International\navailable\n  commercial finance\n \nMedium-sized businesses Rs1 million\u2013Rs50 million\n  100\u2013200 employees Local banks and subsidized\ninternational finance\n \n\u201cThe Missing Middle\u201d\n  Small businesses Small companies lack Rs50,000\u2013Rs1 million\n5\u2013100 employees Local banks and loan sharks\n  access to finance personal loans\n  Number of \nMicro businesses Rs1\u2013Rs50,000\n  1\u20135 employees companies Microfinance loan sharks and\npersonal loans\n \n  Source: Asian Development Bank.\n \n56.  ADB's proposed assistance will be used to supplement some of SIDBI's existing but \ninadequate financing programs for its MSE customers through its direct and indirect financing \nactivities. To achieve this objective, SIDBI will provide subloans ranging from Rs50,000 to Rs1 \nmillion (around $1,042\u2013$20,824), with maturities of up to 7 years, to its larger and more mature \nMSEs that want to graduate from MFI support and move into the formal sector. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n57.  The proposed intervention will be an innovative, hybrid program that combines ADB's \nsovereign lending operations with an NSO modality (i.e., the proposed PCG facility without a \ncounter-guarantee  from  the  Government),  to  be  complemented  with  gender-  and  poverty-\nfocused capacity building for some of the poorest and most vulnerable women. The Project has \nbeen designed to ensure that different segments of the MSME sector are reached. Those MSEs \nthat cannot access the MFI or banking sector will be targeted through the loan to SIDBI, while \nenterprises with access (albeit limited) to bank finance will be targeted under the PCG facility. \nThe two financing modalities are effectively complementary. The proposed PCG facility would \nhelp expose India's public sector banks to the international capital markets and facilitate capital \nmarket development, and bring additional funds that would be used for the MSME sector, which \nhas tremendous potential for income and employment generation. The additionality is important, \nespecially in the context of the Government's enhanced borrowing program, which results in \npart from its stimulus package, and the concerns of crowding out that it has raised.   \n \n58.  The Project has been designed to avoid duplicating or contradicting the numerous other \nongoing initiatives of various donors operating in the MSME sector, namely DFID, GTZ, the \nInternational Finance Corporation, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, UNIDO, \nand the World Bank. Instead, it would build on and expand the reach of these initiatives. ADB ", " 17\nwould coordinate closely with the ongoing programs of donor partners and be guided by their \nharmonized results framework.  \n \n59.  Evidence  from  the  fact-finding  mission  and  discussions  with  various  government \nagencies, private sector banks, and multilateral and bilateral donors suggest that the credit \ncrunch associated with the global economic crisis has accentuated the credit shortage faced by \nmicroentrepreneurs (who are predominantly women) through the associated JFPR-financed \nCBG,  currently  under  consideration  by  the  GOJ.  To  specifically  address  this  concern  and \nenhance the project\u2019s gender focus, the loan to SIDBI contains the specific requirement that at \nleast 30% of the proceeds to be provided through its direct lending operations will be earmarked \nfor lending to qualified women micro and small entrepreneurs. However, offering financing alone \nwill not be sufficient to target the specific needs and constraints faced by female micro and \nsmall entrepreneurs. Support for capacity-development interventions targeting female micro \nand/or small entrepreneurs is also needed, and would be provided by the proposed CBG of up \nto $3 million to be financed by the JFPR, currently under consideration by the GOJ. It would \nsupport innovative approaches to promoting women's microentrepreneurship in selected states \nwith high poverty levels and weak capacity.  \n \nD.  Proposed Partial Credit Guarantee Facility \n \n60.  The proposed PCG facility, without government counterindemnity, will be provided from \nADB's OCR. The PCG facility will be made available to one or several participating banks, which \nwill be the large commercial public sector banks in India. Each PCG will cover a portion of \nprincipal  and  interest  payments  on  a  financial  instrument  (either  a  syndicated  loan  or  an \ninternational bond) issued by the relevant participating bank and sold to investors.  \n \n61.  Each  PCG  will  cover  less  than  100%  of  the  principal  and  interest of  an  individual \nfinancial  instrument.  It  is  expected  that  the  guaranteed  bond  or  loan  with  a  tenor  of \napproximately up to 5 years (maximum of 10 years, on a strictly exceptional basis) will be \ndenominated in US dollars. It may, however, also be denominated in Japanese yen or in euros, \nin which case the PCG will be denominated in the same currency as the underlying debt \ninstrument.  \n \n62.  Subject to the consent of ADB Management, ADB will enter into a counterindemnity \nagreement with the relevant participating bank in support of each PCG. The conditions of each \nPCG will be determined on a case-by-case basis and based on the results of a detailed due \ndiligence review of the participating bank and its SME lending processes and operations. This \nreview will be conducted with the same rigor as are reviews for any direct, noncontingent \ninvestment by ADB. ADB will monitor the participating bank's compliance with the terms of the \ncounterindemnity  through  annual  on-site  review  of  each  participating  bank\u2019s  exposure  to \nMSMEs, and specifically (i) the portfolio quality underwritten by the participating banks, (ii) \ncompletion of agreed business targets indicated in the business plans, and (iii) compliance with \nADB's  prohibited  investment  list.  The  specific  guarantee  structure,  amount,  terms  and \nconditions, as well as pricing rationale will be subject to further review by ADB's Office of Risk \nManagement and presented to the Investment Committee for approval. \n \n63.  The  participating  banks  will  be  required  to  establish  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) following the guidelines in Appendix 7 and setting out detailed \nscreening and assessment procedures\u2014these systems will be reviewed by ADB. Since the \nloans  by  participating  banks  to  SMEs  will  be  largely  in  the  service,  trade,  and  light \nmanufacturing sectors, involuntary resettlement or detrimental impacts on indigenous people \n ", "1 8 \nare unlikely. An annual environmental compliance monitoring report will be submitted by each \nparticipating bank to ADB. In addition, the participating banks will be required to ensure that the \nloan proceeds will not be used to finance activities that are on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment list. \n \nE.  Proposed Loan to Small Industries Development Bank of India \n \n1.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n64.  SIDBI will be the borrower of the ADB loan of $50 million to be funded from ADB\u2019s OCR. \nThe proposed loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and a commitment fee of 0.15 per annum and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The Government will provide a sovereign guarantee in a form and \nsubstance  acceptable  to  ADB  in  respect  of  the  proposed  loan  and  will  charge  SIDBI  an \nappropriate guarantee fee. SIDBI has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that this was its own \nindependent decision and not made as a result of any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n65.  Onlending by SIDBI to eligible subborrowers will be at interest rates that reflect SIDBI\u2019s \ncost of funds plus a spread to cover transaction costs and risks. Subloans will be on full \ncommercial and competitive terms. \n \n2.  Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Project Management \n \n66.  The borrower and executing agency (EA) will be SIDBI. The Government will provide a \nguarantee of SIDBI's obligations to ADB in respect of the proposed loan. SIDBI's board of \ndirectors will provide policy direction and strategic oversight. The project management division \n(PMD) of SIDBI, which was established in connection with the earlier World Bank project, will be \nused  to  coordinate  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  SIDBI  is  highly \ncommitted to the Project, has assigned dedicated project staff, and has extensive experience \nmanaging donor credit lines (e.g., from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, KfW, and \nthe World Bank) as well as donor grant funds (e.g., from DFID).  \n \nb.  SIDBI's Onlending to Subborrowers \n \n67.  In  line  with  SIDBI's  existing  organizational  setup  which  divides  SIDBI's  business \nactivities into direct and indirect lending operations, an amount of at least 30% of the ADB loan \nwill be used by SIDBI for direct financing of commercially viable MSMEs in targeted states. \nQualified female entrepreneurs will be given preference to access the loan. For its direct lending \noperations, SIDBI will ensure that at least 30% of the subborrowers will be qualified female \nMSME entrepreneurs. \n \n68.  SIDBI's branches will use the 30% allocation of the ADB loan to provide subloans in \nlocal currency ranging from Rs50,000\u2013Rs1 million (approximately $1,042\u2013$20,824) and with \nmaturities of up to 7 years to its larger and more mature MSME clients that want to graduate \nfrom MFI support and move into the formal financial sector. SIDBI has provided an assurance \nthat the funds would be relent to MSMEs and not diverted for any other purpose and also \nensure that the outstanding amount of MSME loans at any point of time is higher than the \namounts of the outstanding ADB loan. ", " 19\nc.  Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) Eligibility \n \n69.  SIDBI will use up to 70% of the proceeds from the ADB loan to provide funding for \nonlending  to  MSMEs  to  PFIs  which  could  be  either  scheduled  banks,  nonbank  financial \ncompanies (NBFCs), or microfinance institutions (MFIs). \n \n70.  PFIs that are scheduled banks will have to comply with the following requirements: \n \n(i)  MSME lending and Microfinance commitment and capacity of scheduled \nbanks.

Moreover,  in  case  a  financial \ninstrument has been issued by a scheduled bank, then it must at least have a \ndomestic  credit  rating  of  A  or  equivalent,  issued  by  a  credit  rating  agency \nacceptable to ADB. Each PFI must at least maintain this grade throughout the life \nof the Project.  \n(iii)  Scheduled  bank  corporate  governance.  Each  scheduled  bank  has  to \ndemonstrate compliance with RBI's measures for corporate governance of banks \nand financial institutions, which includes (a) corporate governance structures that \npromote  effective  identification,  monitoring,  and  management  of  all  material \nbusiness  risks;  (b)  systems  for  ensuring  compliance  with  all  statutory  and \nregulatory requirements; (c) implementation of financial disclosure requirements \nfor market participants and observers; and (d) setting of corporate governance \nobjectives, strategies, and techniques. \n(iv)  MSME  risk  management  procedures.

The scheduled bank should \nhave the control structure and capacity to systematically evaluate and conduct \ncredit risk appraisal, asset-liability management, internal control and compliance, \nas well as market risks (e.g., interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk).  \n(v)  Compliance. Each scheduled bank shall agree to have environmental and social \nsafeguards management system within an appropriate time frame designed to \nidentify, remedy, and monitor subprojects\u2019 compliance according to national laws \nand ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies.  \n \n71.  NBFC eligibility criteria. PFIs that are NBFCs will have to comply with the following \nrequirements: \n \n(i)  each NBFC should be registered with RBI for a minimum period of 3 years, \n(ii)  net owned funds should be a minimum of Rs50 million, \n ", "2 0 \n(iii)  capital adequacy ratio should be a minimum of 12% (or as prescribed by RBI \nfrom time to time), \n(iv)  gross nonperforming assets in the NBFC loan portfolio should not exceed 6%, \nand \n(v)  SIDBI's internal rating tools would rate any NBFC as minimum credit rating level \n4. \n \n72.  MFI  eligibility  criteria.  PFIs  that  are  MFIs  will  have  to  comply  with  the  following \nrequirements: \n \n(i)  Each MFI has been in existence for at least 5 years and/or has a demonstrated \ntrack record of running a successful microcredit programme at least 3 years. \n(ii)  The MFI has achieved a minimum outreach of 3,000 poor members or has \ndemonstrated the capability to reach this scale within a period of the next 12 \nmonths. \n(iii)  The  MFI  maintains  a  satisfactory  and  transparent  accounting,  management \ninformation system, and internal audit system or is willing to adopt such practices \nwith SIDBI's assistance.  \n(iv)  The MFI has its accounts audited by an external auditor annually or agrees to do \nso immediately after SIDBI's loan approval.  \n \n73.  Any new NBFC or MFI that wants to initiate a microcredit programme may also be \nconsidered  for  financial  assistance  by  SIDBI  if  it  has  been  promoted  and/or  managed  by \nexperienced professionals with an experience of at least 3 years in microcredit and/or banking \nor social and/or financial intermediation. With the exception of MFIs, all such NBFCs entering \nthis new business line will have to be duly registered with RBI and rated by SIDBI's internal \nrating tools as minimum CR4. \n \n74.  Each  PFI  will  enter  into  a  participation  agreement  with  SIDBI.  Each  participation \nagreement will specify the maximum limit of refinancing that SIDBI will provide to the PFI and \nwill require that the participating bank continue to meet the eligibility criteria throughout the \nperiod over which refinancing is made available. Participation agreements would also give \ndetails on the duration of the loan, interest rate, and repayment schedule. All other procedural \naspects regarding financial assistance to PFIs under the ADB loan will be in conformity with the \nexisting systems, guidelines, and procedures followed by SIDBI under the refinance facility to \nbanks and other financial institutions.. \n \nd.  Subborrowers Eligibility \n \n75.  The following criteria will be used to determine the eligibility of subborrowers to access \nthe proposed loan. \n \n(i)  MSMEs must be economically and financially viable. \n(ii)  MSMEs  undertaking  start-up,  expansion,  diversification  or  modernization \nactivities in any of the eligible subsectors, except those on ADB's prohibited \ninvestment activities list (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n(iii)  MSMEs  must  comply  with  SIDBI's  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies. \n(iv)  MSMEs cannot be involved in any activities that would generate involuntary \nresettlement whether permanent or temporary, including for squatters. \n(v)  MSMEs need to be located in one of the targeted states. ", " 21\ne.  Approval Procedure \n \n76.  Subloans to be financed under the ADB loan provided by SIDBI through its direct lending \noperations will be processed following SIDBI\u2019s existing rigorous appraisal system using an \ninternal rating system; the credit appraisal and rating tool will be employed for smaller MSE \nloans, and the rating appraisal model for larger MSE loans. These tools include more than \nsimply  financial  appraisals,  and  emphasize  a  qualitative  assessment  of  the  promoters\u2019 \ncredentials and background and the quality of management. SIDBI ensures that monitoring of \nloans  is  undertaken  with  a  view  to  mitigating  risks.  In  addition,  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement will also entail screening, classification and environmental review, and monitoring \nand reporting of MSE activities through application of the ESMS. Annual rating reviews are \nconducted for each borrower. Monitoring includes (i) post\u2013approval; (ii) onsite monitoring for all \nloans, but particularly those that are stressed or are expected to come under stress; (iii) post-\ndisbursement  verification  of  asset  purchase  and  filing  of  credit  information  with  the  credit \nbureau; (iv) assessment of the role of nominee directors; and (v) review of financial statements. \nTo mitigate asset concentration risks, SIDBI\u2019s board sets sectoral exposure limits, which are \nreviewed every 12 months or on an \"as needed\" basis. SIDBI\u2019s foreign exchange exposure is \nfully hedged, either by using foreign exchange resources for loans to exporters or by purchasing \nhedging products.  \n \nf.  Retroactive Financing \n \n77.  Retroactive  financing  may  be  possible  under  individual  subloans  for  expenditures \nincurred up to 6 months before the signing of the loan agreement, with a ceiling of 20% of the \nloan amount. SIDBI was informed that approval of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinancing any of the proposed projects. Each withdrawal request sent by SIDBI to ADB will \nspecify the nature of financing if retroactive financing is requested. \n \ng.  Implementation Period \n \n78.  The proposed loan to SIDBI will be implemented over 5 years from loan effectiveness. \nThe closing date for submission of drawdown applications, and approval and authorization for \ndisbursement from the loan, will be 31 December 2014. The closing date for disbursements will \nbe 30 June 2015.  \n \nh.  Procurement \n \n79.  MSE  subborrowers  will  be  encouraged  to  follow  ADB  guidelines  for  procurement \napplicable to development finance institutions, with SIDBI assistance when applicable. These \nguidelines require subborrowers to (i) demonstrate that the adopted procurement procedures \nare appropriate, given the circumstances; (ii) ensure that goods and services to be financed by \nsubloans are purchased at a reasonable price with consideration to economy and efficiency, \ngiven the time of delivery, quality, and efficiency; and (iii) ensure that all goods and services to \nbe financed by subloans are procured from ADB member countries. MSE subborrowers will be \nencouraged, in the interest of economy and efficiency, to procure goods through international \ncompetitive bidding and/or international shopping when such procedures are applicable. \n \ni.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n80.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify \n ", "2 2 \ndocumentation process, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used by SIDBI for \nreimbursement, liquidation, and replenishment of eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 \nper individual loan. \n \nj.  Anticorruption \n \n81.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  SIDBI.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nproposed loan to SIDBI. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of SIDBI, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \nDuring  review  missions,  the  financial  management,  governance,  and  anticorruption  risk \nassessments will be updated to ensure that their provisions remain valid and are helping to \nrealize the Project\u2019s objectives.  \n \n82.  In addition, market-based pricing, SIDBI autonomy in selecting subprojects, and regular \nmonitoring will help to reduce the vulnerability to corruption.  \n \nk.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n83.  SIDBI will maintain a separate set of project accounts acceptable to ADB. The statutory \nauditor appointed by RBI for SIDBI will audit these accounts,28 and SIDBI will provide ADB with \ncopies of the account and audit reports within 6 months of the completion of each fiscal year. A \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures should be included in the audit report. The statutory auditor will also provide a \nseparate certificate to ADB certifying SIDBI's compliance with each of the applicable prudential \nregulations and guidelines of the RBI, and its maintenance of at least AA domestic investment \ngrade. Delay in submission of audited financial statements of acceptable quality may result in \nADB suspending loan disbursements. \n \n84.  SIDBI  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  a  quarterly  report  on  the  operational  and  financial \nperformance of SIDBI and project implementation within 1 month after the end of each quarter; \n(ii) a projected annual disbursement schedule broken down by quarters, by 15 December of \neach year; (iii) updated 12-months financial projections of SIDBI, by 31 March of each year; and \n(iv)  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  project  completion,  detailing  project \nimplementation, project costs, loan recoveries, financial conditions of SIDBI, and other details \nthat ADB may consider necessary. \n \nl.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n85.  To facilitate proper project performance monitoring and evaluation, SIDBI will use a \nproject performance management system developed in consultation with ADB. Within 3 months \nafter the loan is effective, the PMD of SIDBI will finalize a methodology for monitoring the \n                                                 \n28 ADB has reviewed the profile of the current statutory auditor, M/s A.J. Shah & Co., and has found the audit firm to \nbe acceptable to ADB for the project audit for the period of their appointment. As and when a new statutory auditor \nis appointed for SIDBI, the latter will share the profile of the auditor with ADB for the purpose of the project audit. ", " 23\nperformance  of  the  Project  that  will  use  the  collected  baseline  data,  targets,  indicators, \nassumptions and risks in the design and monitoring framework. Semiannual project progress \nreports will be prepared by PMD and submitted to SIDBI's management and ADB. The reports \nwill cover key progress including progress on indicators in the design and monitoring framework \nand recommendations for improving the performance. \n \nm.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies \n \n86.  The loan is classified as category \u201cFI\u201d (financial intermediary) under ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002), and category \u201cC\u201d under both ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The loan is expected to have minimal environmental \nimpact, and the subloans to MSEs will be mainly for light manufacturing, trade, and service \nsectors, and adverse impacts on indigenous people and involuntary resettlement are highly \nunlikely. SIDBI will be required to establish an ESMS, following the guidelines in Appendix 7, \nwhich sets out detailed screening and assessment procedures, and the system will be reviewed \nby ADB.29 An annual environmental compliance monitoring report will be submitted by SIDBI to \nADB. In addition, SIDBI will be required to ensure that the loan proceeds will not be used to \nfinance activities that are on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment list. \n \nn.  Project Review \n \n87.  ADB,  with  SIDBI's  assistance,  will  carry  out  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  loan \napproximately 30 months after loan effectiveness. The review will focus on the utilization of the \nloan, assess lending progress by SIDBI to the target borrowers, and evaluate progress in the \nimplementation of deliverables from the associated CBG, currently under consideration by the \nGOJ. ADB will conduct annual project reviews during project implementation. The results of \nreview missions will be shared with Government and SIDBI. \n \nIV.  THE CAPACITY BUILDING GRANT \n \n88.  To enhance project sustainability, a CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, on \nSupporting Microentrepreneurship for Women's Empowerment in an amount of up to $3 million, \nto be financed by JFPR on a grant basis, will complement the two project outputs. The CBG, \ncurrently under consideration by the GOJ, will assist in the development of women's MSEs in \nIndia to ensure that the overarching goal of inclusive economic growth and development of India \nis achieved. The CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, will help enhance the capacity \nof female entrepreneurs and women\u2019s associations to more systematically access the financial \nresources that are made available by the PCG facility, the proposed ADB loan and other \navailable financial resources and services. \n \n89.  Evidence  collected  during  the  fact-finding  mission  and  discussions  with  various \ngovernment agencies, the private sector, and multilateral and bilateral donors suggests that the \ncredit crunch arising from the global economic crisis has accentuated the credit shortage faced \nby  microentrepreneurs.  In  this  context,  the  impact  of  the  proposed  activities  will  enhance \nwomen's micro and small entrepreneurship. The outcome will be greater capacity of poor female \n                                                 \n29 SIDBI has developed a detailed environmental and social safeguards framework with the help of the World Bank. \nThe institutional arrangements already in place include (i) screening by the loan officer at branch level of the loans \nto MSEs and proposed activities being funded; (ii) review of safeguards framework compliance by the central loan \nprocessing cell; (iii) internal audit review, including at various stages of loan disbursement; and (iv) use of a \nmanagement information system to track loan performance, including any specific flags on safeguards. \n ", "2 4 \nmicroentrepreneurs and women\u2019s associations to access financial resources, services, and \nmarket opportunities. More specifically, the grant will support: \n \n(i)  Stocktaking of current practices. This element focuses on enhancing capacity \nin terms of microfinance supply, and will involve assessing current gender-related \npolicies,  strategies,  and  programs  adopted  by  the  SIDBI  Foundation,  MFI \npartners, and SHG federations. Workshops with senior management will identify \ngaps in practices at both wholesale and retail levels. Based on this assessment \nand a comparative analysis, actions to institutionalize gender-responsive policies, \nstrategies, and programs\u2014including project-specific social and gender analysis, \ndatabases and impact assessments\u2014will be identified, assessed, and enhanced \nas needed. Training, capacity building, and lateral learning opportunities among \nSIDBI retail partners will be supported to share experience and facilitate the \ninstitutionalization of socially and gender-inclusive practices. \n(ii)  Promoting  direct  interventions  for  female  microentrepreneurs.  This  will \ninvolve  direct  interventions  that  target  the  specific  needs  of  female \nmicroentrepreneurs,  and  will  be  characterized  by  product  and  technological \ninnovations to deliver sustained financial services to the poor, and business \nprocesses to help reduce the cost of delivery of financial services to the poor. \nActivities supported under this CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, \nmay include (a) the use of new technology platforms in the delivery of financial \nservices (for instance mobile phone banking), (b) design of new products that \nmeets the needs of the poorest microentrepreneurs, and (c) remittances and \ninsurance products for the poor. \n(iii)  Training of state-level women's associations and networks. This element \nfocuses on the demand side, and will involve training activities, capacity building, \nand lateral training on women\u2019s business development, financial literacy, and \nleadership and communication skills. This will be supported by (a) strengthening \nexisting women\u2019s SHGs and cooperatives through social mobilization to enhance \nthe profitability and/or viability of their enterprises and their ability to access \nfinancial resources and markets; (b) supporting capacity development of selected \nwomen\u2019s associations involved in women\u2019s economic empowerment and rights in \nselected project areas, with a focus on poor, self-employed women workers; and \n(c)  promoting  networking  among  associations  of  women  entrepreneurs,  and \nlinkages  among  industries.  In  addition,  this  element  will  provide  livelihood \nenterprise learning advisors to deliver personal guidance and advice on financial \nskills for female microentrepreneurs to selected applicants. \n(iv)  Monitoring and evaluation of results. The CBG, currently under consideration \nby the GOJ, will also support the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem to assess the results, in terms of social and gender equality, of financed \nactivities under this CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, and ensure \nSIDBI reports systematically on its social and gender-related results and impacts. \nBased on the innovative approaches and direct interventions supported under \nthe grant, options for the effective provision of financial resources and services to \naddress the needs of and constraints faced by female microentrepreneurs will be \nassessed, discussed, and reflected upon during a series of national and/or state-\nspecific workshops. \n \n90.  It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs will be the \nEA  for  this  CBG,  currently  under  consideration  by  the  GOJ,  with  SIDBI,  serving  as  the ", " 25\nimplementing agency (IA). The IA will need to interface with and work in close collaboration with \nother government agencies for appropriate dissemination of good practices and lessons. \n \n91.  The total cost of the CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, is estimated to be \napproximately $3 million for these activities. It will be supported through JFPR. The CBG, \ncurrently under consideration by the GOJ, will be implemented over 36 months, commencing in \nFebruary 2010, with a completion date in early 2013.  \n \n92.  The CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, outcomes will be monitored by \nADB, the Department of Economic Affairs, and SIDBI, through consultants\u2019 reports and periodic \nconsultations  and  review  missions.  The  implementation  team  fielded  by  the  IAs  will  be \ncomposed  of  national  experts,  subcontracted  training  institutes,  and  nongovernmental \norganizations,  with  limited  inputs  from  international  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The scale of \nconsultant inputs, terms of reference, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements are \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n93.  This intervention will reinforce the various stimulus measures taken by the Government \nin response to the ongoing global financial crisis. Once the impact of the crisis on employment \ngeneration  became  apparent,  the  Government  asked  commercial  banks  to  increase  their \nlending to MSMEs, and actively mobilized additional external funding. The Government has \nbeen very active in the promotion and development of the MSME sector and perceives this to \nbe a key component in India's overall industrialization policy.  \n \n94.  The design of the proposed Project will represent a new approach to mobilizing financing \nfor the underserved microfinance and MSME sector in India, and will also help provide financing \nfor  the  neglected  \u201cmiddle  segment\u201d  of  microenterprises  to  ensure  the  overarching  goal  of \ninclusive economic growth and development of India is achieved. The proposed intervention \nwould be a very innovative, hybrid program that combines ADB's private and public sector \nlending instruments; by earmarking support for female entrepreneurs, it will enhance the social \ninclusion and gender focus of these instruments. The associated JFPR-financed CBG, currently \nunder consideration by the GOJ, will offer capacity building for some of the poorest and most \nvulnerable women.  \n \n95.  The proposed Project\u2019s two distinct elements, in combination with the CBG, currently \nunder  consideration  by  the  GOJ,  are  expected  to  contribute  to  an  improved  enabling \nenvironment for MSMEs, a financially stronger SIDBI that is better equipped to expand its \nportfolio  of  loans  to  MSEs,  expanded  SME  lending  by  commercial  public  sector  banks \nparticipating in the PCG facility, and increased MSME growth and job creation. All segments of \nthe MSME sector are expected to benefit from better access to and augmented availability of \nfinance. Furthermore, the requirement that at least 30% of the proceeds under the loan to be \nused by SIDBI through its direct lending operations will be earmarked for lending to qualified \nfemale micro and small entrepreneurs will enhance the gender focus of the intervention. The \ngender action plan can be found in Appendix 8. \n \n96.  Assuming an average subloan size of Rs250,000 (approximately $5,208) under the \n\"missing middle\" element of the Project, and a subloan size of Rs1 million (about $20,833) \n ", "2 6 \nunder the PCG facility, it can be expected that approximately 30,000 MSMEs will benefit from \nthe  Project.  Using  the  estimate  that  lending  Rs1  million  generates  approximately  three \nadditional jobs, a rough calculation indicates that at least 7,500 jobs will be created. However, \nany estimates can provide only indicative figures, given the variation in labor intensity among \nMSMEs. Successful project implementation will result in increased MSME investments, output, \nexports, and employment, but it is not realistic to provide exact targets for each variable.  \n \n97.  Furthermore, since all subloans to be provided to the MSME sector under the Project will \nbe on commercial terms, and the MSMEs themselves are private sector entities, the benefits of \npursuing private sector-led MSME development could be significant. More broadly, an emphasis \non  market-based  interest  rates  for  MSME  credit  introduces  a  sustainable  development \nparadigm, in contrast to dependence on government-sponsored, subsidized programs. In this \ncontext, successful project implementation will help support private sector-driven policies for \neconomic growth.  \n \nB.  Corporate Governance \n \n98.  ADB has carefully reviewed the corporate governance structure of SIDBI to ensure that \nsound and transparent business processes and management systems are in place to mitigate \npotential corruption. Corporate governance continues to be a focus for SIDBI, particularly with \nregard to the clear division of responsibility, appropriate checks and balances, and adequate \ndisclosure and transparency. Policy and strategic decisions, monitoring of performance and \nother important matters are dealt with by the board of directors. With regard to operational \nmatters,  SIDBI  has  a  decentralized  decision-making  process,  with  adequate  delegation  of \npowers. \n \n99.  The  SIDBI  Act  provides  for  a  15-member  board  of  directors,  with  eight  positions \nappointed by the Government (chairman and managing director, two full-time directors, two \ngovernment  officials,  and  three  experts  having  specialized  knowledge  or  professional \nexperience). Further, three directors are nominated by the three largest shareholders, and the \nremaining four directors are elected by the remaining shareholders. \n \n100.  The board is supported by a system of committees and subcommittees, the foremost of \nwhich are the executive committee, the audit committee, the risk management committee, and \nthe asset liability committee. A separate committee oversees SIDBI\u2019s microfinance operations. \n \n101.  SIDBI has credit committees authorized with establishing consistency and rapid decision \nmaking, and has adopted a centralized credit appraisal and credit risk management system.  \n \n102.  Most MSMEs are family-owned businesses, with most decisions made by the owners. \nSIDBI\u2019s  appraisal  standards  ensure  that  MSME-related  laws  are  adhered  to  prior  to  loan \napproval. Because these owners are often personally liable for loan repayment (unlike larger \nfirms, where managers rather than owners run the business), and because MSME owners place \na premium on the time value of money, activities funded by the loans are typically implemented \non time. Loans are used either for working capital or the purchase of goods. Given their loan \nrepayment obligations, MSMEs have incentives to manage costs and optimize the value of \nloans and the purchases they fund. \n \n \n ", " 27\nC.  Poverty Impact and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Development \n \n103.  The Project aims to promote specific MSME segments, referred to as the \"missing \nmiddle\" and female microentrepreneurs. The proposed loan to SIDBI targeting the specific \nneeds  and  constraints  faced  by  this  segment  will  contribute  to  employment  generation \nopportunities among underserved low-income MSME borrowers. The Project will also support \nthe goal of poverty reduction through greater access by MSMEs to skills and technology, which \nwill  result  in  greater  utilization  and  value  addition  of  productive  resources  (i.e.,  labor,  raw \nmaterials,  and  infrastructure).  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  is  discussed  in  the  Summary \nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy in Appendix 9. The Project recognizes that making \naffordable financial resources available is in itself not sufficient to promote microenterprises. To \nenable  underserved  low-income  entrepreneurs  to  effectively  access  available  financial \nresources and services, the Project will support a range of capacity-development initiatives, \nincluding BDS and financial literacy that target low-income female entrepreneurs in the informal \nsector who are based primarily in semiurban and urban settings. \n \nD.  Main Risks and Mitigating Factors \n \n104.  The main risks of the intervention and its mitigation measures are as follows. \n \n(i)  Macroeconomic risk. A slower-than-expected recovery from the current global \nfinancial  crisis  could  dampen  growth  prospects  in  India.  However,  current \nprojections for  India  indicate  a  relatively  high  average  growth  rate  of  6%  in \nFY2009 and 7% in FY 2010 as the global economy begins to emerge from the \ncrisis. 30 \n(ii)  Nonavailability of adequate legal and regulatory framework. Access to credit \nby  many  Indian  MSMEs  continues  to  remain  constrained  because  of  a \ncombination of factors that include policy, the legal and regulatory framework (in \nterms  of  recovery,  bankruptcy,  and  contract  enforcement),  institutional \nweaknesses (absence of good credit appraisal and risk management tools), and \nlack  of  reliable  credit  information  on  MSMEs.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the \nGovernment's commitment to implementing some of the recommendations made \nby the various committees set up to study the MSME sector and its constraints. \nIn addition, SIDBI's long-standing experience in the MSME sector and its net \nNPL  ratio  of  less  than  1%  are  testimony  to  SIDBI's  ability  to  undertake \ncommercially successful lending to Indian MSMEs in an imperfect environment. \n(iii)  Credit risk. MSMEs typically carry higher credit risk due to the lack of accurate \nand  reliable  financial  information  on  their  performance,  underdeveloped \nmanagement  capabilities  and  governance  structure,  as  well  as  greater \nvulnerabilities to downside market factors. The program aims to focus on PFIs \nand participating banks that have a robust risk management infrastructure and \nestablished risk assessment methodologies that are specifically tailored to the \nMSME sector, and which have a demonstrated track record in MSME lending. \nDetailed due diligence will cover the banks' operations in general but will also \ninclude an assessment of the PFIs and participating banks' performance in its \nMSME portfolio which will cover asset quality, provisioning standards, cost to \nincome structure, etc. of this particular business segment. \n                                                 \n30 The Asian Development Outlook Update (September 2009) projects that India's growth rate will be 6% in FY2009 \nand 7% in FY 2010. Available: http://www.adb.org/documents/books/ado/2009/Update/ind.pdf. \n ", "2 8 \n(iv)  Effective  fund  disbursement.  SIDBI is expected to be able to channel the \nproceeds from the proposed ADB loan effectively given its strong commitment to \nthe Project, and broad network of branches. SIDBI, which manages an MSME \nportfolio of over $5.0 billion, has managed to sustain continued good financial \nperformance  while  growing  its  business\u2014its  overall  disbursements  grew  by \n87.5% in FY2009 totaling Rs282.97 billion ($5.9 billion). An effective distribution \nnetwork and experience in MSME lending are among several key criteria to be \nlooked at as well in evaluating PFIs under the program. \n(v)  Currency mismatch. As the proposed loan to SIDBI and the funds to be raised \nthrough the PCG facility will be US dollar denominated (or other foreign major \ncurrencies) while most of the lending to the MSME sector is in local currency, \nthere is a potential currency mismatch. However, SIDBI and the PFIs have the \noption of entering into hedging arrangements to mitigate the foreign exchange \nrisk. In addition, SIDBI and PFIs also provide loans in foreign currencies to \nexporting  MSMEs  which,  in  turn,  conduct  most  of  their  (export  and  import) \nbusiness in foreign currencies. \n(vi)  Asset quality of the potential participating banks for the PCG facility. The \nassets of the commercial public sector banks in India, which could be eligible \nparticipating bank candidates for the PCG facility, have been growing rapidly \nover the last few years. This growth could potentially compromise the quality of \ntheir loan books. Due diligence will look closely at the impaired assets of the \nparticipating banks, the extent of restructured loans as well as loan classification \nand provisioning standards to ensure that only participating banks with solid \nasset quality will be considered. \n(vii)  Pressures on Capitalization for potential participating banks for the PCG \nfacility. Rapid asset growth over the last few years has exerted pressure on \ncapitalization and the need to strengthen this is critical particularly in the context \nof India's challenging credit environment.  This is mitigated by the selection \ncriteria for participating banks which include among others: (a) the Government's \ncontinued support as reflected in the participating banks' recapitalization program \nand the government's long-term ownership plans for these participating banks, \nand (b) track record in accessing capital markets. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Small Industries Development Bank of India Assurances  \n \n105.  In addition to the standard assurances and subject to further amendments and additions \nfollowing  ADB  due  diligence,  SIDBI  will  give  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be \nincorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  SIDBI shall maintain its Project Management Division with adequate powers, \nfunctions, staff, and resources. \n(ii)  SIDBI  shall  implement  the  Project  with  due  diligence  and  efficiency  and  in \nconformity  with  sound  banking  practices,  and  in  accordance  with  business \npractices acceptable to ADB. \n(iii)  SIDBI shall ensure that each PFI agrees to carry out the Project in accordance \nwith the agreed ESMS, as amended from time to time, for activities financed \nunder the Project, and train its staff to implement the ESMS; \n(iv)  SIDBI  will  ensure  that  the  PFIs  satisfy  the  selection  and  ongoing  eligibility \ncriteria to serve as a PFI under MSMEDP described in paragraph 70 above. ", " 29\nSIDBI will also ensure that subborrowers are selected based on the criteria \ndescribed in paragraph 75 above. \n(v)  SIDBI  will  carry  out  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  ESMS,  as \namended from time to time, for activities financed under the Project, and train its \nstaff to implement the ESMS; \n(vi)  SIDBI  shall  maintain  a  financial management  system,  carry  out  audits,  and \nfurnish financial monitoring reports to ADB in the agreed formats and periodicity; \n(vii)  SIDBI's annual project reports will include at least the following information (a) \nemerging  sector  policy  issues,  (b)  performance  of  SIDBI,  (c)  subloans \nperformance, (d) subborrowers repayment performance, (e) lessons learned, \nand (f) benefit monitoring in terms of output and employment; \n(viii)  SIDBI  will  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  the  project-specific \nGender Action Plan (GAP). The gender-related indicators are included in the \nproject monitoring and evaluation system and that gender-disaggregated data is \ncollected and monitored;  \n(ix)  SIDBI will ensure to advise ADB in advance of any major decision on events \nsuch as mergers and acquisitions, changes in key management officers, and \nany  charter  changes  that  may  have  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  its \norganization, management, policies, procedures, and operations; and \n(x)  Throughout  Project  implementation,  SIDBI  must  be  in  compliance  with  all \napplicable  prudential  regulations  and  guidelines  of  RBI.  In  addition,  each \nscheduled bank  accredited  to  be  a  PFI  must  be  in  compliance  with  (a)  all \napplicable prudential regulations and guidelines of the appropriate regulator, and \n(b) maintenance of at least domestic investment grade of A of all its rated \nfinancial instruments as issued by a credit rating agency acceptable to ADB. \nCompliance with RBI prudential regulations and guidelines will be certified by an \nacceptable auditor to ADB while the applicable credit rating will be based on the \nsubmission of the actual credit rating report to RBI. \n \nB.  Partial Credit Guarantee Facility \n \n106.  The following requirements will apply to any PCG being issued by ADB.  \n \n(i)  No objection letter. Prior to the effectiveness of any PCG, the Government will \nbe requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed PCG. \n(ii)  Guarantee documentation. ADB will enter into suitable documentation, in form \nand substance, satisfactory to ADB following approval of the proposed financing \nby ADB Board of Directors. \n(iii)  ADB's Safeguard Policies. The Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and the Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \nPolicy (2003) of ADB will be explained to each participating bank. Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire each participating bank to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures and controls following international best practice standards for the \npurpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing \nof terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \nThe counter-indemnity agreement between ADB and each participating bank will \nfurther  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings. \n(iv)  Increase  in  MSME  portfolio.  Each  participating  bank  will  be  required  to \ndemonstrate  to  ADB's  satisfaction  an  increase  in  its  MSME  portfolio  in  the \n ", "3 0 \nselected states equal to the amount of funding raised by such participating bank \nthrough the use of a PCG. \n(v)  Environmental and Social Safeguards Management System. All participating \nbanks will be required to develop and implement the Environmental and Social \nSafeguards Management System within an appropriate time frame and train their \nstaff to implement it. \n \nC.  Investment Limits \n \n107.  The proposed transaction for a $250 million PCG facility, once approved and signed, will \nincrease ADB's projected nonsovereign exposure for 2009 to $4.6 billion, based on the 30 \nSeptember 2009 outstanding amount and the projected disbursements until 31 December 2009. \nExposure to India will increase to $1.1 billion or 23.3% of total nonsovereign operations, while \nthe exposure to the stateowned commercial banks subsector will increase to $0.7 billion or \n16.0%.  The  proposed  financing  is  within  ADB\u2019s  country  and  industry  exposure  limits  for \nnonsovereign transactions, whereas the group and single obligor exposure limits are not yet \ndetermined pending identification of participating banks. ADB will ensure that financing provided \nto each participating bank will not breach the prescribed limits for group and single obligor \nexposure. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n108.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $50,000,000  to the Small Industries Development Bank of India, to \nbe  guaranteed  by  India,  for  the  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements presented to the Board; and  \n(ii)  the partial credit guarantee facility, without a counterguarantee from India, of \n$250,000,000  to  provide  partial  credit  guarantees  for  one  or  more  financial \ninstruments issued by one or more selected participating financial institutions, on \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n                Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n22 January 2010 ", "Appendix 1  31\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources   \n  Performance Targets  and/or Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \nHelp MSMEs in India  5% increase in the number  Periodic reports from  Assumptions \nrealize their full potential,  of MSMEs established over  the Planning  Continued strong \nthereby assisting  the next 3 years (figures to  Commission  commitment by the \nMSMEs in India to be  be disaggregated by    Government to reforms \nfully developed,  gender) (2008 baseline:  Project-specific   \nespecially those led by  12.8 million MSMEs)  information and data  Global economy \nfemale    collected  recovers from the \nmicroentrepreneurs  5% increase in MSME    financial crisis \nsector employment over the  Economic reports   \nnext 3 years (figures to be  and official statistics  Risk \ndisaggregated by gender)  of the Government  Weakened \n(2008 baseline: 42 million  and other  implementation of \npeople employed in the  international  reforms \nMSME sector)  development   \n  agencies \n \nOutcome       \nImproved MSME access  10% growth in the number  Economic reports  Assumptions \nto commercial financing  of MSMEs receiving term  and official statistics  Macroeconomic stability \nand market  financing through this  of the Government   \nopportunities, thereby  project, starting in 2010  and other  Commitment to reforms \nfostering MSME growth,  (2008 baseline for Indian  international   \ncompetitiveness, and  banking sector: 17%)  development  Project design can be \nemployment creation    agencies  implemented \n  20% increase in direct     \nlending to MSMEs by SIDBI  Quarterly reports  Commitment of SIDBI \nand the PFIs, and overall  from SIDBI and all  and SIDBI partners to \nincrease in their MSME  PFIs  further advance gender \nportfolio (FY2008 baseline    and socially inclusive \nfor SIDBI: 37%)  Reports by  approaches \n  international rating   \nAt least one successful  agencies on SIDBI   \ncommercial debt finance or  and all PFIs  Risks \nbond issue in international    Lenders fail to develop \ncapital market by an Indian  Central Bank  effective loan application \ncommercial public sector  statistics  processes and the \nbank (2008 baseline: nil)    supporting technical \n  Information and data  skills required for a \nAnnual increase of 20% in  collected by SIDBI,  sustainable commercial \nthe number of successful  through its  MSME lending system \napplications by low-income  management   \nfemale entrepreneurs at  information system  Indian MSMEs remain \nSIDBI branches in selected  (carried out under the  too small to become real \nstates (2008 baseline: 5  CBG, currently under  engines of growth and \nmillion)  consideration by the  cannot contribute \n  Government of  sufficiently to job \nJapan)  creation \n \nResistance to reforms \n ", "32   Appendix 1 \n    Data Sources   \n  Performance Targets  and/or Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nfrom vested interests \n \nADB credit \nenhancement may not \novercome international \ncapital market access \nbarrier \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Government of India (the Government) has emphasized the need to develop the \nmicro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) sector in each of India's five-year plans (FYPs) \nbeginning with the first plan (1951\u20131956). This has occurred in recognition of the tremendous \npotential of this sector to generate broad-based productive employment and income growth, \ngiven India\u2019s large labor surplus and already overcrowded agriculture sector, which suffers from \nlow productivity. MSMEs typically have comparatively high labor-capital ratios, shorter gestation \nperiods, low investment requirements, and can effectively mobilize local capital and skills that \nwould otherwise remain unutilized.  \n \nB.  Evolution  of  the  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  in  India's \nDevelopment Planning \n \n2.  Over  the  course  of  various  FYPs  the  Government  launched  several  schemes  that \nfocused on the development of the MSME sector, provided tax and other incentives, protected \nthe sector through reservations (i.e., mandating that certain items could be produced only by \nsmall-scale industries (SSIs), and used the large nationalized banking network to increase \nlending to businesses in this sector. For example, the list of items reserved for the small-scale \nsector was increased from 124 in the late 1960s to 500 in 1977, 873 in 1984, and 836 in 1989, \nand was reduced only after economic reforms were initiated in 1991.1 The Government has set \nup several bodies over the years to facilitate the development and growth of sectors various \nsubsegments. The Small Scale Industries Board, Coir Board, Central Silk Board, All India \nHandloom Board, All India Handicrafts Boards, and All India Khadi and Village Industries Board \nwere all set up during the first FYP. The Small Industries Development Organization was set up \nin 1954 to function as the apex body for formulating policies and coordinating programs for \ndeveloping SSIs. The National Small Industries Corporation Limited was set up in 1955 to \nprovide machinery to small scale units on a hire-purchase basis and to assist them in procuring \norders from government departments. The program of industrial estates was started in 1955 to \nprovide factory facilities and common infrastructural services in one location for the benefit of \nsmall and medium-sized businesses. The district industrial centers program was introduced in \nMay 1979 to establish centers in each district that would provide a package of assistance \n(including  credit  guidance,  raw  materials,  training,  and  marketing  assistance)  to  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Several schemes to provide financial assistance to small \nbusinesses have been introduced over the years, including the Small Industries Development \nFund in 1986, the National Equity Fund in 1987, and the single window scheme in 1988.  \n \n3.  Note that the definition of SSIs has changed over time, as shown in Table A2.1. \n                                                 \n1  The number of items reserved for small-scale industries has been reduced from 873 in 1984 to 21 in 2009.  \n ", "Appendix 2  35 \nTable A2.1: Changing Definitions of Industries and Enterprises, \nby Investment in Plant and Machinery \n \nYear  Small Scale Industries  Ancillary Units Tiny Enterprises \n1977  <$114,123  <$171,184  <$11,412 \n1991  <$264,445  <$330,557  <$22,037 \n2000  <$222,518  <$222,518  <$55,630 \nNote: $1 = Rs8.7 in 1977, $1 = Rs22.7 in 1991, and $1 = Rs45 in 2000. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n4.  The Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 was the \nmost comprehensive landmark legislation for the promotion, development, and enhancement of \nthe competitiveness of the MSME sector, and came into effect in October 2006. The act seeks \nto facilitate the development of MSMEs while increasing their competitiveness. It provides the \nfirst-ever legal framework that recognizes the concept of enterprise as encompassing both \nmanufacturing and service entities. Given the rapidly increasing share of the services sector in \nIndia's gross domestic product\u2014currently, around 56%\u2014inclusion of service entities under the \nact was appropriate. The act defines \u201cmedium enterprises\u201d for the first time and seeks to \nintegrate the three tiers of these enterprises (micro, small, and medium) as shown in Table \nA2.2. \n \nTable A2.2: Enterprise Definitions according to the  \nMicro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Development Act, 2006 \n \n  Investment Ceiling (excluding land and building) \nClassification  Manufacturing  Service \nMicro  < Rs2.5 million ($52,083)  < Rs1 million ($20,833) \nSmall  \u2265 Rs2.5 million and < Rs5.0 million  \u2265 Rs1 million and < Rs20 million \n($52,083 and $104,167)  ($20,833 and $416,667) \nMedium  \u2265 Rs5.0 million and < Rs100 million  \u2265 Rs20 million < Rs50 million \n($104,167 and $2.083 million)  ($416,667 and $1.041 million) \nSource: Biswas, I. and M.

The MSMED Act also provides for a consultative mechanism at the national level, with \nbalanced stakeholder representation from all three classes of enterprises, and with a wide range \nof advisory functions. The act also established specific funds for the development of these \nenterprises, provided notification of programs for this purpose, established progressive credit \npolicies  and  practices,  gave  preference  in  Government  procurement  to  micro  and  small \nenterprise (MSE) products and services, established more effective mechanisms for mitigating \nthe problem of delayed payments to MSEs, and a scheme for easing the closure of such \nenterprises. \n \n6.  The overall MSME sector has increased in strength over time as a result of these \ninitiatives, but systemic constraints continue to reduce its performance. While each segment of \nthe  MSME  sector\u2014micro,  small,  and  medium  enterprises\u2014has  its  own  niche  and  its  own \nchallenges  and  opportunities,  generic  problems  need  to  be  addressed,  including  most \nimportantly the difficulty MSMEs face in accessing adequate and timely financing, particularly \nlonger-tenor  loans,  on  competitive  terms.  These  problems  have  been  exacerbated  by  the \ncurrent global financial crisis and the resultant liquidity constraints for longer-tenor funds in the \nIndian financial sector, with the result that MSMEs facing even greater constraints in accessing \nadequate finance. Infrastructural constraints, poor business development services, inadequate \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nmarketing network, technological obsolescence and a weak research base, and the dispersed \nand unorganized nature of the MSE segment are additional problems that add to the constraints \nposed by inadequate finance, and further impede the growth of MSMEs.  \n \n7.  Nevertheless, the importance of the MSME sector in India and the urgent need to \nreinforce  efforts  to  develop  it  further  are  clear.  Even  the  11th  FYP  (FY2007\u2013FY2011) \nemphasizes the critical role that the MSME sector can play in making growth inclusive and in \nbridging the sector, regional, and gender divides that continue to plague India. The 11th FYP \nnotes that the MSME sector in India accounts for around 95% of all industrial units, nearly 40% \nof the total industrial production, and 34% of exports.2 The sector produces more than 6,000 \nproducts, including household items (e.g., soaps and pickles). The MSE subsector employs \nnearly 32 million people (making it the second largest after the agriculture sector) in around 13 \nmillion enterprises (Table A2.3). SSIs alone contribute about 6.7% to India\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct.3 The Planning Commission's working group on MSMEs for the 11th FYP (FY2007\u2013\nFY2011) has estimated a need for Rs296.4 billion (approximately $61 billion) as the working \ncapital and term loans for MSEs during the plan period. This amount comes within the overall \nstipulated 40% ceiling for priority sector lending.  \n \nTable A2.3: Performance of the Small Scale Industries Sector \n \n  Number of Units   Production   Employment  Exports \n  Registered  Unregistered  Total  %  $ Million   %    %  $  % \nYear  (million)    (million)  (million) Growth (at current prices)  Growth  (million)  Growth  Million  Growth\n2001\u20132002  1.38  9.15  10.52    59,185    25.23    14,938   \n2002\u20132003  1.60  9.35  10.95  4.1  65,058  9.9  26.37  4.5  17,773  19.0 \n2003\u20132004  1.71  9.69  11.40  4.1  79,332  21.9  27.53  4.4  21,249  19.6 \n2004\u20132005  1.82  10.04  11.86  4.0  95,655  20.6  28.76  4.5  27,690  30.3 \n2005\u20132006  1.93  10.41  12.34  4.0  112,447  17.6  29.99  4.3  33,935  22.6 \n2006\u20132007  2.03  10.81  12.84  4.1  129,207  14.9  31.25  4.2     \n2007\u20132008*  2.23  11.14  13.37  4.1  172,741  33.7  32.23  3.1     \nSource: Reserve Bank of India. \n \nC.  Current Institutional Structure of the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Sector \n \n8.  Although  the  state  governments  have  primary  responsibility  for  promoting  and \ndeveloping MSMEs, the central government has always proactively supplemented their efforts. \nThe Ministry of MSME undertakes various schemes and programs to (i) facilitate adequate \ncredit  flow  from  financial  institutions  and  banks;  (ii)  support  technology  upgrading  and \nmodernization;  (iii)  provide  integrated  infrastructural  facilities;  (iv)  provide  modern  testing \nfacilities and quality certification and exposure to modern management practices; (v) support \nentrepreneurship  and  skill  development,  product  development,  design  interventions,  and \npackaging; (vi) promote the welfare of artisans and workers; (vii) facilitate access to domestic \nand export markets; and (viii) take cluster-wide measures to promote capacity building and \nempowerment of enterprises.  \n \n9.  The Ministry of MSME has two divisions, namely: the Small Scale Industries (SSI) \nDivision and the Agro & Rural Industries (ARI) Division. The SSI Division is responsible for \nsupervising  the  work  of  the  National  Small  Industries  Corporation  (NSIC)  Ltd.,  and  three \n                                                 \n2  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2007. 11th Five Year Plan Document. New Delhi (Vol. III, para. \n7.1.334, page 195).  \n3  It has been estimated that Rs1 million of investment in fixed assets in the small scale sector produces 4.62 million \nworth of goods or services, with an approximate value addition of 10%.  \n ", "Appendix 2  37 \nautonomous  national-level  entrepreneurship  development  and  training  institutes. 4  It  also \nimplements  the  various  schemes  for  marketing  and  export  promotion.  The  ARI  Division \nadministers two statutory bodies\u2014the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and the \nCoir  Board.  The  Office  of  the  Development  Commissioner  (MSME)  helps  in  formulating, \ncoordinating, implementing and monitoring different policies and programs for the development \nof  MSMEs.5 It  provides  a  comprehensive  range  of  common  facilities,  technology  support \nservices, and marketing assistance through its network of thirty MSME development institutes \nand its 28 branches, and several testing, training, and technology development centers. The \nOffice of the Development Commissioner (MSME) and its branches also work as links between \nthe central and the state governments in the area of MSME development.  \n \n10.  The  Fourth  All  India  Census  of  MSMEs,  with  the  reference  year  of  2006\u20132007,  is \ncurrently being conducted by the Office of the Development Commissioner (MSME).6 Given the \nexpansion  under  the  MSMED  Act  2006  to  include  both  manufacturing  and  service  sector \nenterprises in the MSME sector, this census will provide information that is critical to informed \nplanning and policy making; it will collect information on medium-sized enterprises in addition to \nMSEs.   \n \nD.  Lack of Access to Finance \n \n11.  Several factors constrain the growth and competitiveness of Indian MSMEs, including \nmost importantly the problems MSMEs face in accessing adequate and timely financing and \nworking capital loans on competitive terms. A brief description of these problems is given below. \n \n12.  Lack  of  adequate  credit  and  working  capital.  While  there  are  several  funding \nschemes for MSMEs, their access to credit remains constrained as a result of policy, the legal \nand regulatory framework (i.e., bankruptcy and contract enforcement), institutional weaknesses \n(the absence of good credit appraisal and risk management and monitoring tools), and the lack \nof reliable credit information on MSMEs. This has made it difficult for lenders to assess risk \npremiums properly, creating differences in the perceived versus real risk profiles of MSMEs. \nThe Nayak Committee, set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1991, recommended that \nworking capital amounting to 20% of their annual turnover should be made available, but \nMSMEs  and  Khadi  and  village  units  currently  receive  only  an  estimated  13.3%  of  their \nproduction value from commercial banks.  \n \n13.  Lack of bank financing to micro, small, and medium enterprises. In most countries, \nsmall, new, high-growth enterprises rely mainly on equity financing. As small businesses grow, \nthere  is  a natural  progression  from  equity  to  debt  financing,  and  from  short-  to  long-term \nfinancing. However, Indian MSMEs, even during their initial phase, have traditionally relied \nmuch more on debt financing\u2014from banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs)\u2014than \ntheir counterparts elsewhere.  \n                                                 \n4  These include the National Institute for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Hyderabad, the National Institute \nfor Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development in Noida, and the Indian Institute for Entrepreneurship in \nGuwahati.  \n5  The Small Industries Development Organization has been subsumed under the Office of the Development \nCommissioner (MSME).  \n6  The first census, conducted in 1973\u20131974, covered 0.26 million SSIs registered up to 30 November 1973; the \nsecond census, conducted in 1990\u20131991, covered 0.98 million businesses registered up to 31 March 1988; the \nthird census was conducted in 2002\u20132003 and covered 1.37 million registered and 9.2 million unregistered \nbusinesses.  While  all  registered  businesses  were  surveyed,  only  a  representative  sample  of  unregistered \nbusinesses was surveyed.   \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \n  Figure A2.1: Sources of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Finance\n  in India and People's Republic of China \n \n% %\n  India People\u2019s Republic of China\n60 60\n \n \n  40 40\n \n  20 20\n \n \n0 0\n  Retained Parent Bank Loan Equity Other (largely Retained Parent Bank Loan Equity Other (largely\nEarnings other loans) Earnings other loans)\n \n \n  <20 20\u2013100 100 plus\n  Source: World Bank. 2004.

While Indian firms employing less than 100 workers source more than 50% of their \nfinancing from banks and other loans, the comparable figure for Chinese firms is about 30% \n(Figure A2.1). However, debt financing for Indian MSMEs from both NBFIs and banks has \ndropped sharply in recent years. The shrinkage of the NBFI sector in response to policy and \nregulatory changes has resulted in MSMEs no longer having access to financing from this \nsource.  \n \n15.  The percentage share of MSMEs in bank credit declined from 15.1% in FY1995 to 8.1% \nin FY2006, with the drop attributable in part to the expansion in lending to the fast-growing \nexport, housing, and retail sectors. Credit to the MSME sector is treated by the regulatory \nauthorities as part of \"priority sector lending\" by banks, and public and private sector banks \nmust lend 40% of their net bank credit, and foreign banks 32% of net bank credit, to the priority \nsector. However, the share of lending to the MSME sector as a percentage of total priority \nsector lending has declined from 58% in 1969 to just 18% in FY2006.  \n \n16.  The Third All-India Small-Scale Industries Census (FY2001) found that only 14.2% of the \nregistered and 3.09% of the unregistered small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) accessed \nbank finance. In recent years, the financing constraints faced by MSMEs have become even \nmore  severe.  Difficulty  in  accessing  financing  has  restricted  the  establishment  of  small \nenterprises,  their  evolution  into  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  the  overall  growth  and \ndevelopment of the MSME sector. \n ", "Appendix 2  39 \n \n  Figure A2.2: Share Percentage of Small and Medium Enterprise Credit in Total Credit\n \n14\n \n  12\n \ne 10\nr\n  a\nh\nS 8\n  nt \n  e 6\nc\nr\n  Pe 4\n \n2\n \n  0\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n \n \nNationalized Banks Foreign Banks Private Banks\n \n  Source: Reserve Bank of India.\n \n17.  At the same time, bank credit to MSMEs has also declined sharply (Figure A2.2). While \nthe banking system has adequate short-term liquidity, most banks report that they are unable to \nraise the longer-term resources needed to match the term financing needs of MSMEs. Also, \nwhile overall interest rates have been falling, this seems to have mainly helped the larger firms, \nfor which the cost of borrowing is now about 40% lower than 3 years ago.  \n \n18.  Competition is forcing banks into other areas, such as consumer credit and mortgage \nfinancing. Meanwhile, MSMEs appear to have been bypassed by the banking system. The \nlimited debt financing that is available to Indian MSMEs is of a short maturity (less than 1 year) \nand relatively costly in comparison to that available to larger firms. The cost of 1-year loans for \neven the best MSMEs is around 8%\u201310%,7 with most MSMEs charged interest rates of 10%\u2013\n15% on 1-year loans. By comparison, the interest rate on short-term government paper is \ncurrently 3.25%. \n \n19.  To illustrate, an MSME client is usually charged interest rates slightly higher than the \nbenchmark prime lending rate (PLR) of banks.8 This means that while an \"AAA\" rated large \ncorporate entity can get loans at PLR, or 1%\u20131.5% below the PLR, lending to MSMEs is rarely \nbelow the PLR.  \n \n20.  The  reluctance  of  banks  to  aggressively  target  the  MSME  sector  is  rooted  in  (i) \ninsufficient data available on MSMEs, (ii) lack of credible published information on MSME \nfinancial health, (iii) the high vulnerability of small enterprises in a liberalizing economy, and (iv) \ninadequate risk management systems still in place in some banks.  \n \n21.  Difficulty  in  arranging  collateral  or  third-party  guarantees  continues  to  be  a  major \nproblem facing the MSME sector. Although the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), \n                                                 \n7  As an example, the country's largest lender, the State Bank of India, announced on 11 April 2009 that its lending \nrates for SMEs on new loans of up to Rs50,000 had been cut to 8%, and for loans of Rs50,000\u2013Rs250,000 to 10%. \nThe rates will be available for the next 2 years, and will be applicable for working capital and term loans provided \nthey are covered under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises scheme. \n8  The benchmark prime lending rate of Bank of Baroda, one of the leading public sector banks in India, was 12% as \nof 1 April 2009, while ICICI Bank, India\u2019s largest private bank, cut its benchmark advance rate by 50 basis points to \n16.25% as of 24 April 2009. \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \nhas  issued  instructions  to  provide  collateral-free  loans  up  to  Rs500,000  (approximately \n$10,416), RBI statistics show that at the end of FY2008, only 24% of the total outstanding loans \nunder this threshold amount were without collateral. The difficulty in arranging collateral (due to \nasymmetric  information)  contributes  to  the  high  cost  of  credit  to  MSMEs  and  impacts  the \ncompetitiveness of their products.  \n \nE.  Limited Access to Markets \n \n22.  Access to markets\u2014in terms of market linkages; transport; telecommunications; and \nfinancial, technological, and information exchange\u2014is vital for the growth of semiurban, small \ntown, and village areas. Low demand is perceived as the most serious obstacle to doing \nbusiness in nonmetropolitan areas, and is linked significantly to poor access to larger markets. \nMost MSMEs do not have money to invest in market research and are unable to carry out \ndesign and technical improvements to keep up with market demands. Unlike big businesses, \nthey cannot invest in advertising and packaging. This limits their ability to tap markets and \nattract consumers. MSMEs, especially those pertaining to traditional livelihoods, are therefore \nincreasingly forced to rely on middlemen, petty traders, and big businesses to market their \nproducts.  \n \nF.  Women Entrepreneurs\u2019 Limited Access to Credit \n \n23.  The  rate  of  female  entrepreneurship  in  rural  nonfarm  enterprises  is  lower  than  in \nmetropolitan firms. Nonmetropolitan enterprises owned by women are smaller, newer, and more \nlikely  to  be  informal  and  homebased.  Female  entrepreneurs  are  less  educated  and  have \nsignificantly less access to enterprise finance. It is estimated that over a 5-year period, India lost \nabout 30 million person-days of potential employment owing to the inadequate availability of \nbank credit for MSMEs.9 In this respect, support for MSMEs can help invigorate the nonfarm \nsector by generating sustainable employment, stemming distress migration, supporting value \naddition in rural areas, and enhancing productivity of agriculture by absorbing excess labor. In \nachieving  these  outcomes,  MSMEs  benefit  women  both  directly  in  terms  of  wages,  and \nindirectly by supplementing family incomes, reducing drudgery, and providing sustained social \ncapital. Marginalized groups like small farmers can also benefit from gains in productivity. \nOffering financing alone will not be sufficient to address the constraints faced by low-income \nfemale entrepreneurs, and support for capacity building interventions targeting the specific \nneeds and constraints faced by female entrepreneurs is critically needed. \n \nG.  Wage and Productivity Differential \n \n24.  There is a huge productivity and wage gap between small and large enterprises in India \nrelative to other countries. For instance, a comparison between India and the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) indicates that average wages in India are around $1,293 annually, which is 20% \nlower than the $1,611 average annual wage in the PRC (Table A2.4). However, the average \nmasks the real problem, which is that 57% of manufacturing workers in India are employed in \nsmall enterprises, and earn an average of just $587, or almost half that earned by workers in \nsmall enterprises in the PRC. In addition, these figures pertain to nonhousehold manufacturing. \nIncluding household manufacturing enterprises would likely increase the wage and productivity \ndifferentials. A comparison between India and other successful Asian economies (e.g., Malaysia \nand Thailand) yields similar results. \n \n                                                 \n9  Government of India. 2007.

Overview of Small Industries Development Bank of India and Its Shareholding \nStructure \n \n1.  Overview \n \n1.  The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) was established in April 1990 \nby  an  Act  of  Parliament  (the  SIDBI  Act)  as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Industrial \nDevelopment Bank of India (IDBI). SIDBI was created to act as the principal financial institution \nfor promoting, financing, and developing the micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) \nsector  in  India.  It  provides  indirect  assistance  to  MSMEs  by  refinancing  primary  lending \ninstitutions  (PLIs)  such  as  commercial  banks,  state  finance  companies  (SFCs),  and  state \nindustrial development corporations (SIDCs). It also provides direct support to MSMEs through \nterm  loans,  bill  discounting,  pre-shipment  and  post-shipment  credit,  and  coordinates  the \nfunctions of other institutions involved in MSME sector financing and development. \n \n2.  In recognition of the growing importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \nin the Indian economy, SIDBI\u2019s mandate was expanded following the passage of the Micro, \nSmall, and Medium Enterprises Development Act in October 2006 to include medium-sized \nenterprises (i.e., so-called \u201cmedium enterprises\u201d). \n \n2.  Shareholder Structure \n \n3.  As a Government of India (the Government) public sector financial institution, SIDBI was \nwholly owned by IDBI until 2004. Following an amendment to the SIDBI Act, the majority of the \nequity held by IDBI was transferred to various other public sector and financial institutions, and \nis currently held by 36 institutions comprising public sector banks and insurance companies \nowned or controlled by the central government. IDBI Bank Ltd, the State Bank of India, and the \nLife Insurance Corporation of India are the largest shareholders. \n \nB.  Business Strategy and Operations of Small Industries Development Bank of India \n \n4.  SIDBI has played a central role in the recent development of the MSME sector by \nproviding  financing,  both  direct  and  indirect,  to  MSMEs  for  new  business  establishment, \nexpansion, diversification, modernization, quality improvement, and the rehabilitation of MSMEs \nthat are not performing well. SIDBI has also helped to shape the development of the MSME \nsector  by  providing  developmental  assistance  to  financial  institutions  and  businesses  for \ntechnology upgrading, environmental management, and domestic and international marketing.  \n \n5.  The global financial crisis affected SIDBI's underlying operations during FY2008 (ending \n31 March 2008). Although India was largely shielded from the crisis because of its inherent \neconomic structure, growth was constrained in FY2008. Declining private investment, dwindling \ncapital inflows, shrinking foreign exchange reserves, weakening exports, and a depreciating \nrupee  are  among  the  factors  that  constrained  growth.  This  affected  business  confidence, \ndemand from SIDBI clients, and SIDBI's profit for FY2008 in terms of profitability and liquidity \npositions. \n \n6.  SIDBI\u2019s overall assistance portfolio (new business) for the past 7 years is broken down \nin Table A3.1.  \n ", "Appendix 3  43\nTable A3.1: Small Industries Development Bank of India (New Business)  \n(Rs billion) \n \nScheme  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008 \nIndirect Assistance               \n- Refinancing \n  (including STL to banks)  63.74  80.34  42.5  44.19  58.98  54.30  101.14 \nDirect Assistance                \n- Equity Assistance  0.54  0.54  0.42  0.43  0.41  0.34  0.25 \n- Bills Financing  7.82  7.53  9.51  13.05  18.43  24.04  29.54 \n- Resource Support   4.92  10.49  13.02  16.03  8.94  5.50  8.26 \n- Project Financing  12.76  9.65  16.19  15.21  29.45  22.64  14.72 \nMicrofinance \n(including P&D Assistance)  0.45  0.46  0.79  1.96  3.56  4.20  7.73 \nTotal  90.25  109.03  82.46  90.9  119.75  111.02  161.64 \nFY = fiscal year, P&D = promotional and development support, STL = short-term lending. \nSource: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n \n1.  Indirect Assistance \n \n7.  Of SIDBI\u2019s activities, indirect assistance or the refinancing of PLIs accounted for 62.6% \nof SIDBI\u2019s total loan portfolio as of the end of FY2008. SIDBI refinances eligible PLIs\u2014which \nare predominantly commercial banks, SFCs, and SIDCs\u2014against term loans given to industrial \nconcerns  in  the  MSME  sector  for  setting  up,  expanding,  modernizing,  or  diversifying  their \noperations. In FY2007, such refinancing included Rs54.3 billion in new loans and Rs51.9 billion \nin  disbursements,  and,  in  FY2008,  Rs101.1  billion  in  new  loans  and  Rs91.5  billion  in \ndisbursements. In FY2007, equity investments amounting to Rs0.34 billion were approved. \nTable A3.2 provides an overview of SIDBI's indirect assistance. \n \nTable A3.2: Small Industries Development Bank of India Indirect Assistance \n(New Loans and Disbursements) \n(Rs billion) \n \nInstitution  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004 FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008 \nBanks               \n- Loans  51.99  72.66  37.25  39.45  51.55  45.15  92.38 \n- Disbursements  32.69  42.75  12.97  20.70  40.29  44.29  85.01 \nSFCs               \n- Loans  10.99  7.49  5.18  8.86  7.32  9.13  8.76 \n- Disbursements  8.11  5.80  4.16  6.02  5.66  7.58  6.52 \nSIDCs               \n- Loans  0.76  0.18  0.06  0.37  0.09  0.01  0.00 \n- Disbursements  0.64  0.16  0.05  0.20  0.03  0.02  0.00 \nTotals               \n- Loans  63.75  80.34  42.50  44.19  58.97  54.30  101.14 \n- Disbursements  41.44  48.72  17.19  26.93  45.98  51.89  91.54 \nFY = fiscal year, SFC = state financial corporation, SIDC = state industrial development corporation. \nSource: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n \n8.  Commercial  banks  have  been  the  largest  recipients  of  assistance  under  SIDBI\u2019s \nrefinancing scheme, accounting for 91.3% of the total amount of refinancing assistance as of \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \nFY2008. However, demand from commercial banks has fluctuated considerably over the past \nfew years, depending on the banks\u2019 liquidity. Refinance to banks has gone up during FY2008 by \nalmost 92% (to Rs85.0 billion), due to tight liquidity in the financial system. However, the \nrefinance disbursed to SFCs was lower (Rs6.5 billion during FY2008).   \n \n9.  SFCs have received significant funding under SIDBI\u2019s refinancing scheme. Established \nas  state  level  development  financial  institutions,  the  18  SFCs  in  India  act  as  the  primary \nproviders of credit to MSMEs and the SME sector within their given states. Under the SFC Act, \nSIDBI became the second largest shareholder in SFCs when it was established in 1990 and the \nsingle largest resource provider. As of FY2008, SFCs account for 8.7% of the total amount of \nSIDBI\u2019s refinancing assistance. Despite the dependence of SFCs on refinancing assistance in \nrecent  years,  SIDBI  has  sought  to  restrict  its  overall  exposure  to  SFCs  because  of  their \ndeteriorating financial condition and performance (although these have improved of late). \n \n2.  Direct Assistance \n \n10.  SIDBI\u2019s direct assistance schemes comprised 37.4% of its total loan portfolio as of \nFY2008. These schemes are broken into three broad categories: (i) nonfund-based facility, (ii) \nMSME receivable finance and working capital facility, and (iii) term loan assistance. Direct \nassistance is also a key business area of the SIDBI's growth strategy.  \n \na.  Nonfund-Based Facility \n \n11.  SIDBI provides guarantees and letters of credit on behalf of MSMEs. Business under the \nnonfund-based facility increased during FY2008, with an increase in both the number of letters \nof credit (from 146 to 160) and guarantees (from 0 to 44). In FY2008 letters of credit equaled \nRs0.8 billion, and guarantees Rs0.9 billion.  \n \nb.  Receivable Finance and Working Capital Facility \n \n12.  SIDBI meets the short-term working capital needs of the MSMEs through its MSME \nreceivable finance scheme, invoice discounting, and other similar means. The working capital \nfacility leverages the technology platform of IDBI Bank Ltd. Total disbursements under MSME \nreceivable finance increased by 22.5% to Rs28.9 billion during FY2008 (disbursed).  \n \nc.  Term Loan Assistance \n \n13.  Assistance is provided for various term-funding needs of MSMEs. SIDBI increased its \noutreach through various channels to reach new segments of the MSME sector. It has also \nhelped MSMEs undertake modernization and upgrades under different government schemes. \nSIDBI approved Rs11.8 billion and disbursed Rs10.5 billion in term loans and working capital in \nFY2008. \n \nd.  Other Credit Facilities \n \n14.  In addition to retail credit, SIDBI provides assistance through infrastructure financing, \nventure capital, and securitization to help increase the flow of credit to the MSME sector. In \nterms of microfinance, the total credit sanctions increased by 92.2% in FY2008 to Rs7.5 billion \nand disbursements by 98% to Rs7.0 billion. SIDBI also provided equity support of Rs0.6 billion. \nIn addition, in FY2008 a new product\u2014equity support to MSMEs to enable them to upscale their \nactivities and achieve vertical integration with official equipment manufacturers\u2014was launched. \n ", "Appendix 3  45\nIn FY2008, SIDBI also introduced a comprehensive guarantee scheme to provide financial, \nperformance, and deferred payment guarantees to its MSME customers. \n \n3.  Promotional and Development Support \n \n15.  Promotional and developmental activities seek to promote entrepreneurship, resulting in \nself-employment and creation of additional employment through programs such as the Rural \nIndustries Programme, Entrepreneurship Development Programmes (EDPs), and Vocational \nTraining Programmes. Promotional and developmental activities also develop and strengthen \nthe MSME sector through the Skill-cum-Technology Upgradation Programme, Small Industries \nManagement Programme, Cluster Development Programme, and marketing assistance. \n \n16.  For example, the Rural Industries Programme is a comprehensive enterprise support \nservice program for the benefit of entrepreneurs that aims to promote viable rural enterprises, \nleading  to  employment  generation  in  rural  areas.  The  package  of  business  development \nservices includes motivation of rural entrepreneurs and identification of viable ventures based \non local skills, resources, and training. In FY2008, SIDBI extended the program to nine new \ndistricts. As of March 2008, the program is being implemented in 47 districts in 21 states, in \npartnership with 28 agencies. \n \n17.  In  addition,  the  EDPs  promote  self-employed  ventures  capable  of  generating \nemployment opportunities, especially in rural areas, targeting less privileged sections of society. \nEDP institutions such as the Rural Development and Self-Employment Training Institute, Ujire \nand Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India, and Ahmedabad provide annual support \nfor conducting a variety of entrepreneurship-related programs. In FY2008, SIDBI supported 185 \nEDPs, including 123 programs through the Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India and \nthe Rural Development and Self-Employment Training Institute. As of 31 March 2008, the total \nnumber of EDPs supported by the bank was 2,561, covering about 64,000 participants.   \n \n4.  Business Strategy \n \n18.  In FY2008, despite the global financial crisis, SIDBI improved its financial performance in \nmost  areas.  It  recorded  the  highest-ever  approvals  and  disbursements,  with  approvals \nincreasing by 45.6% and disbursements by 47.5% over FY2007. Refinance support increased \nby  76.4%.  Direct  credit  flow  to  MSMEs  increased  by  18.0%  over  the  same  period.  The \naggregate outstanding portfolio increased by 26.2% to Rs202 billion as of 31 March 2008. The \ndecline of net income in FY2008 was due to a treatment of a cumulative contribution to the \ncorpus  of  credit  guarantee  fund  trust  for  micro  and  small  enterprises  of  Rs3.2  billion  as \nexpenditure. The business strategy seeks to further extend the current business growth.  \n \na.  Product Development \n \n19.  SIDBI intends to enhance the current financial products and develop new ones to meet \nthe varied credit requirements of MSMEs. One important new product launched in FY2008 was \nthe equity support to the MSME units. In addition, SIDBI introduced a comprehensive guarantee \nscheme during the year for providing financial, performance, and deferred payment guarantees \nto its customers in the MSME sector. This is expected to become a major source of nonfund-\nbased income for the bank in coming years. Customized products and arrangements relating to \nvendors of official equipment manufacturers, franchise assistance, cash flow discounting, and \nassistance for raw material purchase were introduced on a pilot basis during FY2008.  \n \n ", "46  Appendix 3 \nb.  Branch Expansion and Cluster Development \n \n20.  SIDBI\u2019s headquarters are in Lucknow, supported by offices in Mumbai, (which also \ncarries out many head office functions), Chennai, Delhi, and Kolkata. As an integral part of its \nstrategy to increase its accessibility to its direct clients, SIDBI opened nine new branches during \nFY2008 at Alwar (Rajasthan), Balanagar (Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh), Chinchwad (Pune, \nMaharashtra),  Hubli  (Karnataka),  Jamnagar  (Gujarat),  Kolhapur  (Maharashtra),  Kozhikode \n(Kerala), Kundli (Haryana), and Tiruchirappalli (Tamil Nadu), increasing the total branch network \nto 79 branches as of 31 March 2008 (an increase from 64 branches as of 31 March 2007). \nThese 79 branches now cater to 480 MSME clusters comprising 266 micro clusters and 214 \nSME  clusters.  SIDBI  presently  has  100  branches  of  which  7  are  dedicated  microfinance \nbranches. Many of the new branches are located in key business and commercial centers or \n\u201cclusters,\u201d especially for targeted industries such as food processing and textiles.  \n \nc.  Cluster Approach \n \n21.  Cluster-based financing is another business strategy. During FY2008, SIDBI took a \nsignificant step towards encouraging new models for energy efficiency projects based on the \nclean  development  mechanism  (CDM).  A  memorandum  of  understanding  was  signed  in \nNovember 2007 between SIDBI and a special purpose vehicle to forge a cluster to facilitate a \nCDM project in Ludhiana, Punjab, under which MSMEs would be encouraged to implement \nenergy saving initiatives through a \u201cbundling mechanism.\u201d Around 300 MSMEs are expected to \nbenefit from this project. An intervention was also made in the Bellary Jean cluster in Karnataka.  \n \nd.  Cooperation with State Financial Corporations \n \n22.  In FY2008, IDBI\u2019s shareholdings of SFCs and outstanding loans in lieu of capital were \ntransferred to SIDBI in compliance with the SFCs (Amendment) Act, 2000. SIDBI intends to \nrevive and strengthen the SFCs. It entered into a tripartite memorandum of understanding with \n11 SFCs and their respective state governments in order to help improve their performance. In \nFY2008, SIDBI provided financial assistance of Rs6.5 billion to SFCs. It also constituted a \nboard-level committee for supervision of SFCs. \n \ne.  Nonperforming Assets Management \n \n23.  In  FY2008,  SIDBI  planned  to  conduct  preventive  nonperforming  assets  (NPA) \nmanagement and recovery for its NPA portfolio. NPAs are to be monitored, with restructuring \nand  recovery  strategies  developed  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  SIDBI  intended  to  recover  a \nsizable amount from NPAs under the refinance (Rs2.2 billion) and direct finance (Rs0.57 billion) \nportfolios. \n \nf.  Support to North Eastern Regions \n \n24.  SIDBI has a business focus on the northeastern region in terms of microfinance, rural \nindustrialization, entrepreneurship development, and marketing support. SIDBI set up a cell at \nGuwahati  for  the  development  of  the  northeastern  region  to  identify  potential  business \nopportunities in the seven northeastern states. In FY2008, over Rs7.2 million in assistance for \nthe region was extended under various programs. Under the cluster development programme in \nfive different states, activities such as bamboo mat weaving, carpet weaving, and handloom \nweaving could benefit about 900 artisans. In FY2008, SIDBI formed partnerships with four new \n ", "Appendix 3  47\nmicrofinance institutions from the northeastern region. Aggregate assistance of Rs0.1 billion \nwas channeled to these microfinance institutions in 2008. \n \nC.  Organization of Small Industries Development Bank of India \n \n1.  Corporate Governance \n \n25.  Corporate governance continues to be an important area for SIDBI, particularly with \nregard to the clear division of responsibility, appropriate checks and balances, and adequate \ndisclosure and transparency. Policy and strategic decisions, monitoring of performance and \nother important matters are dealt with by the board of directors. With regard to operational \nmatters,  SIDBI  has  a  decentralized  decision-making  process,  with  adequate  delegation  of \npowers. \n \n26.  The  SIDBI  Act  provides  for  a  15-member  board  of  directors,  with  eight  positions \nappointed by the Government (Chairman and Managing Director, two full-time directors, two \ngovernment officials, and three experts with specialized knowledge or professional experience). \nThree  directors  are  nominated  by  the  three  largest  shareholding  institutions,  banks,  and \ninsurance companies, and the remaining four directors are elected by the public shareholders. \nDuring FY2008, the board held seven meetings. At present 12 of the board seats are filled. \nTable A3.3 lists the composition of SIDBI's board.  \n \nTable A3.3: Small Industries Development Bank of India's Board of Directors \n \nOfficer  Designation \nShri R.M.

Separate \ncommittees  include  the  committee  for  supervision  of  SFCs  and  empowered  committee  on \nmicrofinance. \n ", "48  Appendix 3 \n29.  The executive committee was composed of seven members as of FY2008, including the \nchairman  and  managing  director  of  the  board  of  directors  who  acts  as  chairman  of  the \ncommittee. In addition to considering credit proposals, the executive committee carries out \nexecutive functions that are delegated by the board of directors. The committee meets when \nneeded. The audit committee is composed of five members, meets six times per year, and \noversees  the  audit  function  of  SIDBI,  and  provides  guidance  on  matters  relating  to  the \nfinalization of accounts. The highest authority for risk management is the risk management \ncommittee, which reports to the board of directors. This committee looks broadly at credit, \nliquidity, currency, interest rates, and operational risks in coordination with the credit committees \nand the asset liability committee. Specific tasks include setting up the exposure limit structure \nand  monitoring  compliance,  establishing  industry  segments  and  subsegments  for  lending \nactivities,  providing  risk  grading  and  risk  premiums  for  pricing,  and  providing  borrower \nassessment  methodologies.  The  risk  management  committee  meets  when  needed.  The \nempowered  committee  on  microfinance  guides  SIDBI  in  all  matters  pertaining  to  the \nmicrofinance sector, including providing approval for microcredit assistance.

The  committee  held  14 \nmeetings during FY2008 and made various recommendations, such as a revision in interest \nrates.  \n \n31.  Finally, the investment committee formulates strategies and recommends investment \noptions with regard to SIDBI's investment portfolio. In order to assist secondary equity market \noperations, a subcommittee of the investment committee was also formed. The subcommittee \nmeets on a daily basis to adjust the investment decision based on market conditions. It reviews \nSIDBI's portfolio regarding investments in various instruments, including equity. The investment \ncommittee held 12 meetings to deliberate on various investment proposals, fixing of floor price, \nshifting of securities, among other issues \n \n2.

Subsidiaries and Associates \n \na.  Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises \n \n33.  Following implementation of the MSME Act in October 2006, the Credit Guarantee Fund \nTrust for Small Industries was renamed the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small \nEnterprises (CGTMSE) as of July 2007. CGTMSE operates the credit guarantee scheme for \nmicro and small enterprises (MSEs), which guarantees credit facilities extended by member \n ", "Appendix 3  49\nlending  institutions  to  MSEs  that  are  not  backed  by  collateral  security  and  third  party \nguarantees.  As  of  March  2008,  the  total  paid-in  capital  of  the  trust  was  Rs15.8  billion, \ncontributed by the Ministry of MSME (Rs12.7 billion) and SIDBI (Rs31.7 billion) on a 4:1 ratio. \nOn 2 January 2009, the maximum loan size to be guaranteed by CGTMSE was increased from \nRs500,000 to Rs1 million, with guarantee coverage expanded to 85% of loans up to Rs500,000, \nand 80% for larger loans. The lock-in (waiting) period after which CGTMSE would pay a claim \nwas reduced from 24 to 18 months. Since the establishment of the CGTMSE, the trust fund has \napproved over 146,000 proposals for a total investment amount of Rs47.25 billion\u2014with 50,000 \nproposals approved in FY2009 alone.

The SME Growth \nFund has committed venture capital investments of Rs0.43 billion in respect \nof 23 proposals, and a disbursement of Rs0.23 billion as of 31 March 2008. \n \nc.  India SME Technology Services Ltd \n \n35.  India  SME  Technology  Services  Limited  was  set  up  in  November  2005  to  provide \nprofessional  services  related  to  technology  transfer,  joint  ventures,  business  collaboration, \nfinance syndication, and attendant support services to MSMEs. India SME Technology Services \nLimited identified CDM and carbon credits as its area of focus throughout FY2008, and it has \nbeen  working  actively  in  MSME  clusters  by  organizing awareness  campaigns  and  guiding \nMSMEs to take advantage of the opportunities existing in the carbon credit market. It entered \ninto a memorandum of understanding with KfW, a German development bank, for cooperation \nin the area of trading of certified emission reductions. It also works with development institutions \nlike GTZ to establish a program for CDM activities for energy efficiency in various MSME \nclusters in India.  \n \nd.  SME Rating Agency of India Limited \n \n36.  The SME Rating Agency of India Limited (SMERA) is a joint initiative by SIDBI, Dun & \nBradstreet Information Services India, Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, and several \n ", "50  Appendix 3 \nleading banks. SMERA is the country's first and still the only rating agency to focus primarily on \nMSMEs. SMERA's primary objective is to provide ratings that are comprehensive, transparent, \nand reliable so as to facilitate greater and easier flow of credit from the banking sector to SMEs. \nSMERA  started  operations  on  5  September  2005.  SMERA  recorded  strong  growth  during \nFY2008 in terms of fresh ratings of 1,150 MSMEs. As of March 2008, there were 696 rated \nSMEs, compared with 546 in March 2007.  \n \ne.  India SME Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd \n \n37.  Most recently, to address the high level of NPAs in the MSME sector, SIDBI set up India \nSME  Asset  Reconstruction  Company  Ltd  as  an  asset  reconstruction  company.  The \nshareholders are expected to include ten large public sector banks, Life Insurance Corporation \nof India, and three state-level institutions. The company has been incorporated, and statutory \npermissions are being obtained. \n \n4.  Credit Risk Management \n \na.  Credit Risk Policy \n \n38.  In coordination with the risk management committee, the risk management department \noversees the formulation, amendment, and periodic review of SIDBI\u2019s loan policy. The loan \npolicy sets out the guidelines for direct and indirect lending, covering such aspects as product \nand  process  management,  provisioning  norms,  pricing,  credit  risk  management,  credit \nmonitoring, and restructuring of accounts. Although the basic tenets of SIDBI\u2019s loan policy have \nbeen in place for several years\u2014and follow \u201cknow your customer\u201d norms issued by the RBI\u2014\nmanagement has recently sought to align its strategy, organizational structure, and processes in \nlight of (i) SIDBI\u2019s SFC exposure, (ii) the push to increase the direct lending portfolio, and (iii) \nthe expanded mandate to service medium-sized enterprises. To this end, the credit appraisal, \ncredit risk management, and monitoring and recovery processes have been enhanced through \nthe adoption and adaptation of internal risk-rating models, a revised exposure limit framework, \nprocesses to prevent the deterioration of asset quality, and risk-based pricing. \n \ni.  Credit Appraisal and Credit Risk Management \n \n39.  SIDBI uses standard loan application forms in an effort to better and more efficiently \nassess the risks of a potential borrower. For loan applications up to Rs20 million ($400,000) for \nexisting MSME clients (and service sector projects, banks, nonbanking financial companies and \ninfrastructure projects), the appraisal and credit rating is carried out using the credit analysis \nand rating tool (CART). This in-house system guides the credit officer through an integrated \ncomputer-based process of appraisal and credit rating of the proposed loan. These models are \neffective tools that are used to streamline and simplify the credit risk review process, thereby \nenabling a risk-based management system. \n \n40.  For credit ratings for loans other than in CART, SIDBI has adopted the risk assessment \nmodel (RAM). Developed by the Indian rating agency CRISIL, RAM assigns a separate obligor \nrating, which reflects the probability of default, and a facility rating, which reflects the loss given \ndefault. These two ratings are then combined to provide a final rating, which is displayed in the \nform of a risk grade. There are eight risk grades (CR1 to CR8), with CR1 being the top grade. \nRAM is installed on SIDBI\u2019s central server at the offices in Mumbai; being web-based, it is \naccessible to all its field offices.  \n ", "Appendix 3  51\n41.  RAM is also used to determine risk ratings for loan applications under the receivable \nfinance scheme, under which SIDBI is basically lending on the strength of the borrower\u2019s \nbalance sheet. \n \n42.  Proposals with an internal risk rating of CR1 to CR5 on the combined scale in RAM \n(RAAA to RA- in the credit analysis and rating tool, and C1 to C5 in receivable finance scheme \nat the time of appraisal are considered \u201cinvestment grade\u201d and suitable for the credit facility. For \ncertain sectors, facilities, and borrower groups, however, higher investment grade ratings have \nbeen stipulated to improve credit quality. \n \n43.  Credit risk mitigation issues relating to individual projects are also addressed by loan \ncovenants and by obtaining collateral. Minimum benchmark norms for the debt\u2013equity ratio, \nasset coverage ratio, margins, and the nature of collateral are stipulated in the loan policy.  \n \nii.  Delegation of Power \n \n44.  In keeping with the strategy to standardize credit appraisal and credit risk management, \nSIDBI has recently adopted a more centralized credit approval process. Loan approval and \nother related powers have been delegated to credit committees for consistency and quick \ndecision making. The delegated lending powers of different committees are shown in Table \nA3.4.  \nTable A3.4: Delegated Lending Powers \n \nCommittee  Approval Limits \nZonal Office-Level Committees   \n- Assistant General Manager Committee  Up to Rs5 million \n- Deputy General Manager Committee  Rs5 million to Rs10 million \n- General Manager Committee  Rs10 million to Rs30 million \n- Zonal Credit Committee  Rs30 million to Rs75 million \nHead Office-Level Committees   \n- Chief General Manager Committee  Rs75 million to Rs100 million \n- Executive Director Committee  Rs100 million to Rs150 million \n- Deputy Managing Director Committee  Rs150 million to Rs225 million \n- Chairman and Managing Director Committee  Rs225 million to Rs300 million \n- Executive Committee  Rs300 million and above \nSource: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n \n45.  At least two members of senior management sit on each committee, in addition to the \nchairman. The members of the committee are individually and collectively responsible for the \ndecisions taken by the committee.  \n \niii.  Exposure Limits \n \n46.  For risk mitigation at the portfolio level, the loan policy lays out the exposure limits in \nterms of single borrower exposure and group exposure, relative to SIDBI's capital funds. Tables \nA3.5 and A3.6 show that SIDBI\u2019s exposure limits are more conservative than those prescribed \nby the RBI for commercial banks. \n \n \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.5: Reserve Bank of India Exposure Limits \n \nParticular   Exposure Limit prescribed by Reserve Bank of India\nSingle Borrower  15% of the capital funds of the financial institution \n(additional 5%\u201310% in case of infrastructure projects) \nFor Group Exposure  40% of the capital funds of the financial institution \n(additional10%\u201315% in case of infrastructure projects) \nSource: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n \nTable A3.6 Small Industries Development Bank of India Exposure Limits  \n \n  SIDBI Exposure Limit  SIDBI Exposure Limit \nParticulars   Direct Assistance  Indirect Assistance \nSingle Borrower   3% of SIDBI\u2019s capital funds   10% of SIDBI\u2019s capital funds \nGroup Exposure   6% of SIDBI\u2019s capital funds  15% of SIDBI\u2019s capital funds \nSIDBI = Small Industries Development Bank of India. \nSource: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n \n47.  Industry  exposure  limits  for  a  few  specific  industries  (including  food,  textiles,  and \nelectronic  equipment)  have  also  been  developed.  These  are  reviewed  annually  or  more \nfrequently, if necessary. The policy also issues list of restricted industries where there is a need \nto follow a selective approach.  \n \nb.  Security \n \n48.  Like  commercial  banks,  SIDBI  usually  accepts  security  in  the  form  of  immovable \nproperty, corporate or personal guarantees, and financial instruments such as shares and fixed \ndeposits. The general guidelines for collateral are as follows.  \n \n(i)  Only marketable residential and commercial properties free from encumbrances \nare accepted by SIDBI as security. In cases where the borrower is unable to \nfurnish any other security, agricultural land or open land is accepted, subject to \nSIDBI  undertaking  a site  visit  to  confirm  its  ownership,  possession, and  the \nexistence of a proper approach road to the property. \n(ii)  Property subject to tenancy rights is generally not accepted as security. \n(iii)  In case of third-party mortgagors, branches are advised to ascertain the kind of \ninterest  the  mortgagor  has  in  the  project  and  his  relationship  with  the \npromoter(s). Extra care needs to be exercised in identifying the mortgagor. A \npersonal guarantee is obtained from the mortgagor. \n(iv)  There are separate guidelines in respect to guarantees issued and properties \nmortgaged  by  Hindu  undivided  families  (HUFs).  As  per  the  guidelines, \nguarantees of HUFs or the mortgage of property owned by a HUF are accepted \nonly when they are offered as security toward assistance extended to the HUF. A \nguarantee of a HUF or the mortgage of HUF property is not accepted when it is \noffered to secure assistance extended to third parties, even if some indirect \nbenefit is accruing to the HUF. \n \n49.  The  policy  also  stresses  the  need  to  put  in  place  a  comprehensive  risk  mitigation \nsystem, including collateral classification and valuation, as prescribed under Basel II. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  53\nc.  SIDBI\u2019s Pricing Process \n \n50.  Notwithstanding the use of the SME fund, SIDBI has recognized the need to improve its \npricing  model,  taking  into  consideration  not  just  the  increasingly  competitive  market,  but \nbalancing  that  with  the  risk-return  assessment  for  each  proposal.  In  conjunction  with  the \nadoption of an enhanced credit appraisal and risk-rating methodologies, SIDBI currently links its \npricing to the risk rating of the proposal. The credit risk-rating process used by SIDBI quantifies \nthe inherent risk in a proposal and gives it a risk grade. \n \nd.  Credit Risk Monitoring \n \n51.  As in some of the commercial banks, the frequency of risk-rating reviews is linked to the \nrisk grade of the account. Ratings for accounts in higher risk grades are reviewed quarterly or \nsemiannually, while for existing standard accounts, the risk rating is reviewed annually.  \n \nD.  Financial Analysis of Small Industries Development Bank of India \n \n52.  This analysis is based on audited accounts for FY2002\u2013FY2008. Financial information \nwas obtained directly from SIDBI and FY2007 and FY2008 annual reports. Accounts were \naudited with no qualification to the end of FY2008 by the chartered accounting firm of M/s A.J. \nShah & Co in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in India.  \n \n1.  Capital Adequacy \n \n53.  SIDBI reported a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 43.16% in FY2006, 37.48% in FY2007, \nand 41.75% as of the end of FY2008. The slight deterioration from the 2006 level can be \nattributed to the global financial turmoil and the weak financial health of SFCs. Nevertheless, the \ncapital adequacy ratio is strong, reflecting demonstrated support from the Government and the \nsubsequent strong resource profile. It reflects SIDBI\u2019s ability to (i) maintain asset quality in its \ndirect financing portfolio during the overall economic slowdown, (ii) minimize losses despite its \nsignificant exposure to financially weak SFCs, and (iii) access low-cost resources. \n \n2.  Asset Quality \n \n54.  Total assets have fluctuated in recent years, largely in response to changes in the loan \nportfolio, investment securities, and bank balances, but remain strong despite SIDBI's exposure \nto weakly performing SFCs and SIDCs. Although SIDBI did not have asset-quality protection \nmechanisms, such as credit guarantee funds, enjoyed by other institutions such as the National \nBank for Agriculture and Rural Development, or the state government guarantees available to \nthe Power Finance Corporation, it was able to maintain strong asset quality. SIDBI has shifted \nits focus to direct financing of MSMEs, which includes schemes for lending to projects in the \nMSME sector, bills discounting, and financing of infrastructure projects.  \n \n55.  In FY2008, the gross NPA ratio was 1.48%, net NPA ratio 0.25%, substandard assets \nratio 0.12%, and doubtful assets ratio 0.13%. Exposure to all SFC NPAs has been fully written \noff. During FY2008, NPAs increased by Rs4.69 billion mainly due to the exposure of Rs3.71 \nbillion to Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation that turned a loss. Overall, the financial market \ndownturn pressured both the SFCs and micro and small businesses to maintain profitability. \nThis could in turn impact the future ability of SIDBI to maintain the asset quality of its direct \nfinancing portfolio.  \n \n ", "54  Appendix 3 \na.  Loan Portfolio \n \n56.  General. Total loans have been increasing, from Rs91.2 billion in FY2004 to Rs130.6 \nbillion in FY2006 and Rs190.8 billion in FY2008. The loan portfolio is projected to continue to \nexpand in line with the efforts to increase direct lending.  \n \n57.  Loan  concentration.  The  Indirect  lending  portfolio  of  SIDBI,  comprising  refinance \nmainly to banks and SFCs and SIDCs, constituted 53% of total assets as of 31 March 2008. \nThe proportion of indirect finance increased as of March 2008 as compared to the same period \nin 2007 due to more credit lines provided to banks. The indirect lending portfolio grew by 43% \nduring FY2008, compared to 5% growth during FY2007. Lending to banks accounted for over \n70% of the refinance portfolio as of March 2008 (59% as of March 2007). During FY2008, the \ndirect lending portfolio grew by 16%, led by growth in term loans, and constituted 30% of total \nassets as of March 2008.  \n \nb.  Nonperforming Assets \n \n58.  SIDBI follows the classification and provisioning policy mandated by RBI. See Table \nA3.7. \n \nTable A3.7: Classification and Provisioning Policy of the Reserve Bank of India \n \nClassification  Definition  Provisioning Level \nStandard  Performing  4% \nStressed   Performing, but concerns after 30 days  4% \nSubstandard  Up to 90 days overdue  10% \nDoubtful A1  90 days to 1 year overdue  20% (secured), 100% (unsecured) \nDoubtful A2  1 to 3 years  30% (secured), 100% (unsecured) \nDoubtful A3  3 years   100% (secured), 100% (unsecured) \nLoss  Over 3 years  100% (secured), 100% (unsecured) \nSource: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n \n59.  Assets representing loan and other assistance portfolios are classified based on record \nof recovery as standard, substandard, doubtful, and loss assets. Provision is made for assets, \nas  per  the  guidelines  issued  by  RBI  as  applicable  to  the  term  lending  and  refinancing \ninstitutions, under the following categories: (i) standard assets (general provision as per RBI \nguidelines); (ii) substandard assets (general provision of 10% of total outstanding); (iii) doubtful \nassets (100% of unsecured portion plus 20%, 30%, or 100% of the secured portion depending \nupon the period for which the asset has remained doubtful, e.g., 1 year [20%], 1\u20133 years [30%], \nand more than 3 years [100%]); and (iv) loss assets (100% of total outstanding).  \n \n60.  The refinance portfolio was a major contributor to NPAs during FY2008. Two accounts \nhad an aggregate of Rs3.77 billion in NPAs. Under the direct finance portfolio, SIDBI recovered \nRs0.57 billion. As a result of recovery and write-off, mainly under refinance, gross NPAs as a \npercentage of the total portfolio outstanding declined from 3.24% to 1.40% as of March 2008. \nHowever, the net NPAs as a percentage of the net outstanding portfolio as of the end of March \n2008 increased to 0.25%, compared to 0.14% at the end of the previous year. In terms of loan \nclassification,  total  net  substandard  assets  in  FY2008,  after  write-offs,  were  Rs0.24  billion \n(0.12% of the total). Doubtful assets, after write-off, were Rs0.25 billion (0.13% of the total). \nTotal provision for bad and doubtful assets was Rs5.2 billion in FY2008 and Rs2.1 billion in \nFY2007. The write-off is Rs4.7 billion, with recovery of Rs2.3 billion in FY2008. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  55\n3.  Funding and Liquidity \n \na.  Funding \n \n61.  Unlike commercial banks, SIDBI is not allowed to take direct deposits to fund its lending \nactivities. Many of its funding sources are from special dispensations from the Government, \nsuch as the Government, RBI, and IDBI. In addition to direct government funding, which is \ncurrently provided interest-free, SIDBI has several other funding sources that have implicit \ngovernment support. These include priority sector bonds and capital gains bonds, which are \nprovided on preferential terms (subscribers are exempt from capital gains tax), as well as \ndeposits  from  foreign  banks  (foreign  banks  with  operations  in  India  are  required  to  make \ndeposits  with  SIDBI  for  any  shortfall  in  their  domestic  lending  programs  toward  \u201cpriority\u201d \nsectors).   \n \n62.  SIDBI has also received significant funding from multilateral financial institutions such as \nthe  World  Bank  (Rs4.6  billion  credit  line  in  FY2008),  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (Rs10.6 billion in FY2008), German development assistance through KfW (Rs5.2 \nbillion in FY2008), and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (Rs0.9 billion in \nFY2008). These deposits, along with the capital gains bonds, form the bulk of SIDBI\u2019s resources \nand enable it to significantly reduce its cost of borrowings. \n \nb.  Liquidity \n \n63.  SIDBI is the foremost refinancing institution for PLIs, and often has to meet its funding \nrequirements at short notice, necessitating the maintenance of reasonable levels of liquidity at \nall times.1 The following table shows the overall assets and liability position for SIDBI in FY2008. \n50.2% of the borrowings are long-term (maturities above 7 years), whereas its assets are \nlargely short- to medium-term (less than 5 years), providing a comfortable liquidity position. \nTable A3.8 provides an overview of SIDBI's asset and liabilities. \n \nTable A3.8: Small Industries Development Bank of India Assets and Liabilities \n(Rs million) \n \nItem  <1 year  1\u20133 Years  3\u20135 Years  5\u20137 Years  >7 Years  Total \nRupee Assets  16,046  5,326  2,699  1,172  1,776  27,019 \nForeign Currency Assets (rupee equivalent) \nDollar  670  42  18  3  0  733 \nEuro  373  157  0  0  0  530 \nYen  2  0  0  0  0  2 \nTotal Assets  17,091  5,525  2,717  1,175  1,776  28,284 \nRupee Liabilities  7,599  3,691  1,570  1,087  14,343  28,290 \nForeign Currency Liabilities (rupee equivalent) \nDollar  180  198  102  95  285  860 \nEuro  23  100  95  92  307  617 \nYen  2  0  0  0  0  2 \nTotal Liabilities  7,804  3,989  1,767  1,274  14,935  29,769 \nSource: Small Industries Development Bank of India. \n \n                                                 \n1  Due dates for repayment of borrowings and amounts of installment are not evenly spread out during the projected \nperiod. \n ", "56  Appendix 3 \n64.

Introduction \n \n1.  It is proposed to establish a guarantee facility of up to $250 million to assist participating \nbanks in raising medium- to long-term funding from the international capital markets and thereby \nenable participating banks to provide credit lines to small and medium-sized enterprises in India \non market-based terms. The facility will be made available to all large commercial public sector \nbanks in India with experience in the micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) sector and \nan extensive branch network. \n \nB.  Concept \n \n2.  The PCG facility proposed in this RRP and to be approved by ADB's Board will be an \numbrella program under which specific PCGs can then be issued to individual participating \nbanks\u2014subject to the Office of Risk Management's review and approval by ADB's Investment \nCommittee Meeting. It is expected that one or more partial credit guarantee (PCG)s may be \nissued to assist participating banks in raising medium to medium to long tenor funding in \ninternational capital markets via a loan or bond with a tenor of 5 years (maximum of 10 years, \non a strictly exceptional basis) and denominated in US dollar or other major foreign currencies \nwhich would be partially guaranteed by ADB. The guaranteed principal amount of financial \ninstruments to be underwritten with an ADB PCG will be up to $250 million and structured so \nthat ADB's total exposure to the Project will not exceed ADB's nonsovereign operations' single \nexposure limit of $250 million equivalent. Consistent with the approach prescribed by ADB's \npolicy for PCGs,1 the limit for the guaranteed amount will be calculated on a net present value \nbasis. \n \n3.  Since October 2008, only State Bank of India and Export-Import Bank of India have \nbeen  able  to  tap  the  international  bond  markets  as  international investors  have  been  risk \naverse, and financing terms have been more attractive in the domestic capital markets. A credit-\nenhanced debt instrument with a PCG from ADB is expected to (i) provide attractive financing \nterms for participating banks in the international capital markets through reduced interest costs \nand longer tenors; and (ii) help the participating banks (a) improve their market profiles, (b) \nexpand and diversify their funding sources, and (c) further reduce their dependence on the \nGovernment of India (the Government), thereby enabling the Government to meet its fiscal \nobligations. \n \nC.  Structure \n \n4.  ADB PCGs are typically designed to cover a portion of the credit risk associated with a \nfinancial instrument. Unlike a full guarantee, which protects lenders and bondholders for 100% \nof the credit risk, PCGs will expose investors to some level of the underlying credit risk. For \nexample, a bond issue credit enhanced by a PCG covers the principal repayment and the first \nand second coupon payments, thereby leaving some of the risks with the buyers of the bond. \nUse of a PCG could extend the tenor and/or lower the pricing of a bond issue by  increasing  the  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

See Figure A6 below for a possible PCG structure for an international bond issue. \n \n \n  Figure A6: Possible Structure of a Partial Credit Guarantee\n \n \nInternational and \n \nLocal Banks and \n  Investors\n \n  Must keep some \n  clean risk\n \n  PCG Trustee/Agent\n \nADB\n \n \nTakes a share of all \n  Direct \ncredit risk\n  Loan/Equity/TA \n  (anchor)\n  Issuer (PFI)\n  Financial Instrument (Bond)\n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FRN = floating rate note, PCG = partial credit guarantee, PFI = participating financial \n \ninstitution, TA = technical assistance.\n  Source: Asian Development Bank.\n \n6.  Market participants have indicated that a structure achieving an A- credit rating will \nlikely be most attractive to investors, although it is ADB's intention to maximize the rating \nupgrade effect of its guarantee, and potentially achieve an A+ rating. To achieve the A- rating, \na  significant  percentage  (estimated  as  80%\u201395%)  of  the  total  debt  service  obligations \n(principal and interest repayments) for the financial instrument will need to be guaranteed by \nADB and/or other creditworthy guarantors (if any). The exact percentage to be guaranteed by \nADB and final structure of each PCG will be subject to discussions with the relevant rating \nagencies. \n \nD.  Terms and Conditions \n \n7.  The ADB-guaranteed debt instrument will be subject to conditions precedent to the \ndisbursement,  such  as  receiving  all  necessary  governmental,  creditor,  and  shareholder \napprovals and consents and financial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. In return for receiving \n                                                 \n2  To illustrate, international bonds issued by the State Bank of India are currently rated at par with the international \nsovereign rating, which is investment grade (i.e., BBB-). A PCG from ADB would provide protection to the State \nBank of India bondholders for the first two interest payments and the repayment of the principal, and could \npotentially enhance the credit rating of the instrument by at least three notches\u2014i.e., lift the rating from BBB- to \nsingle A-, or even to a maximum of A+ depending on the guarantee cover from ADB\u2014thereby making the bonds \nmore acceptable to international investors, and/or lowering the price. \n ", "Appendix 6  67\nthe benefit of ADB's credit enhancement, the participating bank will commit to increase its \nMSME loan portfolio in the selected states by the amount of financing raised using ADB's PCG. \n \nE.  Pricing \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s guarantee fee will be based on commercial considerations and will reflect the \ncredit risk ADB is assuming, as ADB will be liable to the lenders or investors should the issuer \nor borrower default. Pricing will therefore have to reflect the findings of the due diligence \nperformed on the issuer. Factors that will influence the pricing include (i) market practice, (ii) \ncompetition, (iii) underlying risks of the obligor, (iv) ADB's cost of capital, and (v) comparable \nmarket transactions. \n  \n9.  The all-in cost to the issuer of the financial instrument to be underwritten by a PCG will \ninclude front-end fees, guarantee fees, arranger fees, and rating fees along with other fees and \nadministrative expenses in line with market practice. ADB's front-end and guarantee fees will be \ndetermined by ADB's investment committee.  \n \nF.  Eligibility Criteria \n \n10.  Based  on  thorough  due  diligence,  the  participating  banks  have  to  comply  with  the \nfollowing eligibility criteria: \n \n(i)  Micro, small, and medium enterprise lending commitment and capacity of \nparticipating banks. Each participating bank must have (a) a corporate mission \nstatement  regarding  MSME  development  and  related  lending  policies  and \nstrategy, (b) a minimum performance track record of at least 5 years on relevant \nMSME sector lending, and (c) a corporate strategy or business plan for MSME \nlending.  \n(ii)  Participating  bank's  operational  and  financial  eligibility  criteria.  Each \nparticipating  bank  must  be  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  prudential \nregulations and guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), including but not \nlimited to those pertaining to (a) the ratio of risk assets to capital (risk capital tier \n1), (b) recognition of income, (c) loan classification, (d) debt provisioning, and (e) \nthe overall net nonperforming loan ratio, which must not exceed 3%. Moreover, \neach participating bank must have an international credit rating above BB+ (or a \ndomestic rating of AA on the long-term national rating scale of a reputable Indian \ncredit  rating  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  if  the  participating  bank  has  no \ninternational credit rating).  \n(iii)  Maintenance of majority government ownership structure. A major premise \nin the extension of the PCG facility is that accredited participating banks in the \nprogram are all public sector banks with a majority ownership by the government. \nGiven the long-term nature of the guaranty facility, it is key to ensure that the \nownership  profile  will  be  substantially  maintained  during  the  life  of  the  ADB \nfacility  since  the  element  of  continuing  government  support  is  an  important \nconsideration in establishing this intervention. ADB will therefore engage in a \ndialogue with the relevant government ministries to discuss the Government's \nintention with respect to its majority ownership in these participating banks. If \npossible, the counterindemnity agreement will contain language to the effect that \nin case of a change of ownership, the parties will negotiate a mutually agreeable \nremedial solution. Alternatively, the meeting minutes with a participating bank will \n ", "68  Appendix 6 \nnote assurances made by the latter that majority ownership will be maintained by \nthe Government. \n(iv)  Demonstrated track record in accessing the international debt market with \nthe exception of highly qualified first-time issuers. All participating banks to \nbe accredited under the PCG facility will have to demonstrate their track record in \naccessing the international debt market. Exceptions will be allowed on a case-by-\ncase basis for first-time issuers with very strong financial standings. \n(v)  Participating  bank's  corporate  governance.  Each  participating  bank  must \ndemonstrate  compliance  with  RBI's  requirements  on  corporate  governance, \nwhich  include  (a)  corporate  governance  structures  that  promote  effective \nidentification, monitoring, and management of all material business risks; (b) \nsystems for ensuring compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements; \n(c) implementation of financial disclosure requirements for market participants \nand observers; and (d) setting up of corporate governance objectives, strategies, \nand techniques.  \n(vi)  Micro, small, and medium enterprise outreach. Each participating bank must \nhave a demonstrated capability for lending to MSMEs, as evidenced by branch \noperations, lending data and the provision of (or plans to provide) credit and \nadvisory services. \n(vii)  Micro, small, and medium enterprise risk management procedures. Each \neligible  participating  bank  must  have  demonstrated  capability  for  risk \nmanagement  and  established  risk  management  systems,  processes,  and \nprocedures  that  cover,  among  other  things,  (a)  MSME  credit  risk  appraisal; \nasset\u2013liability management; management of foreign exchange exposure, and \ninterest  rate  and  liquidity  risks;  asset  and  property  management;  and  risk \ninsurance coverage; (b) MSME credit scoring for enhancing cash flow-based \nlending; and (c) an MSME risk-grading framework enabling adoption of risk-\nbased loan pricing.  \n(viii)  Compliance.  Each  participating  bank  must  have  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards management systems designed to identify, remedy, and monitor the \ncompliance  of  subprojects  with  ADB  environmental  and  social  safeguard \npolicies.3  \n  \nG.  Documentation \n \n11.  The exact documentation, pricing, and structure of the credit enhancement undertaken \nthrough the ADB PCG will be determined in further discussions and negotiations with the \ninterested participating banks, international rating agencies, and arranging banks. \n \nH.  Justification \n \n12.  Indian public sector banks have significant foreign currency funding needs, including \nforeign currency funding obligations for their MSME clients. However, with the exception of \nState  Bank  of  India  and  Export-Import  Bank  of  India,  Indian  banks  have  not  tapped  the \ninternational capital markets for over a year due to the strong liquidity in India's domestic capital \nmarkets, which have offered more attractive terms relative to offshore financing. The ADB PCG \nis expected to provide more attractive financing terms in the international capital markets for \nparticipating  banks.

Under the proposed transaction structure, ADB will provide a long-term PCG for one or \nmore Indian commercial public sector banks to assist these banks in accessing the international \nbond  and/or  loan  markets.  ADB's  PCG  is  expected  to  attract  international  banks  and/or \ninstitutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds that would not otherwise \ninvest in papers of this nature issued by Indian commercial public sector banks. The proposed \ntransaction  will  therefore  help  broaden  the  lender  and  investor  base  for  Indian  issuers  or \nborrowers and deepen India\u2019s international debt capital markets. \n \n ", "70  Appendix 7 \nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  This environmental and social management system (ESMS) framework provides a basis \nfor the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), its participating financial institutions \n(PFIs) as well as the participating banks under the partial credit guarantee facility to develop \ntheir own set of procedures and requirements to avoid, minimize, mitigate, manage, and monitor \nthe adverse environmental and social impacts of individual subloans, in keeping with the type \nand scale of the subloan, and the nature, sensitivity, and magnitude of its impacts. \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Management System \n \n2.  Each participating financial institution (PFI), participating bank, and Small Industries \nDevelopment Bank of India (SIDBI) will establish and adopt an ESMS to be approved by their \nrespective boards in due course, comprising an ESMS policy, ESMS procedures, and ESMS \ncapacity building plan. In due course, each participating bank, PFI and SIDBI will submit a \ndetailed description of their ESMS to ADB.  \n \n3.  Environmental and social management system policy. As part of the process of \nestablishing an ESMS, each participating bank, PFI, and SIDBI will prepare and adopt an \nenvironmental and social safeguard policy statement to the effect that (i) they will actively \nencourage  and  require  their  customers  to  observe  all  applicable  environmental  and  social \nrequirements; and (ii) if the relevant business activities of a customer contravene applicable \nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements, they will take action to determine the reasons \nfor noncompliance and will discuss with the customer corrective actions acceptable to the \nrelevant authorities. \n \n4.  Environmental and social management system procedure. Before a participating \nbank, PFI, or SIDBI approve an investment or guarantee to an MSME, the concerned staff in a \nparticipating bank, PFI or SIDBI will undertake the following steps to ensure that each client \ncomplies with the applicable safeguard policies of ADB and the Government. ADB's safeguard \npolicies are: Environment Policy (2002), Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on \nIndigenous People (1998), each as amended from time to time. \n \n1.  Due Diligence and Review \n \n(i)  Screen the proposed investment and micro, small and medium enterprise \n(MSME) activities to ensure they are not included in the ADB prohibited \ninvestment activities list.1   \n(ii)  Using  the  ADB  project  classification  criteria,  classify  the  investment \naccording to the significance of its potential environmental and social \nimpacts.2 If the MSE activities to be funded have potential involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  impacts  and  are  classified  as \ncategory A or B, decline to consider the proposed investment, or at least \nthe  component  having  such  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB's prohibited investment activities list is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n2  The environment and social safeguard categories determine the level and type of environmental and social \nassessment, and safeguard reports and plans required.   \n ", "Appendix 7  71\n(iii)  For  investments  classified  as  environment  category  A  or  category  B, \nreview  the  environmental  assessment  reports,  including  safeguard \nplans\u2014e.g.,  initial  environmental  examination  or  environmental  impact \nassessment  including  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nprepared  for  the  proposed  investment\u2014to  ensure  they  meet  the \napplicable government and ADB requirements.  \n(iv)  Ensure that client discloses information relevant to any environmental \nissues associated with the investment, and consults with project-affected \npeople early in project preparation, and that the views of the affected \npeople are taken into account. Ensure that the information disclosure and \nconsultation requirements of ADB and the Government are complied with.   \n(iv)  Visit the site, as required, and review the adequacy of any safeguard \nplans (e.g., the EMP), and the estimated cost of implementing the plan(s). \nIf gaps exist, hold discussions with the MSMEs regarding targeted and \ntime-bound actions to address these gap(s).   \n(v)  If the MSME activities involve an existing facility with potential adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts (category A or B from an environment \nperspective), visit the site, as required, and conduct an audit to identify \ncompliance gaps, if any. In case of compliance gaps, agree with the \nMSME  to  prepare  a  corrective  action  plan,  with  a  budget  and \nimplementation  timeline.  Also  review  the  MSME's  compliance  with \napplicable government environmental and social laws and policies, and \nverify  that  its  client  has  no  claims  pending  against  it.  The  ADB \nenvironmental  assessment  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), \nand their corresponding operations manual sections, must be followed. \n(vi)  For MSMEs with potential adverse environmental and social impacts, if a \nparticipating bank, PFI, or SIDBI is unable to reasonably satisfy itself that \nthe relevant business activities of the client comply with applicable ADB \nand  national  environmental  and  social  policies  and  laws  and \nrequirements, a participating bank, PFI, or SIDBI undertake to do one of \nthe following: \n \n(a)  decline to invest or guarantee the activities of the MSME; or  \n(b)  consider investing or issuing a guarantee subject to the condition \nthat the MSME shall implement an agreed corrective, time-bound \naction plan and budget. \n \n2.  Implementation, including Monitoring and Reporting \n \n(i)  Monitor the performance of the MSME on the basis of its commitments in \nthe  legal  agreement,  and  require  submission  of  periodic  monitoring \nreports to a participating bank, PFI or SIDBI. \n(ii)  Submit an annual report to ADB by the participating bank, PFI, or SIDBI. \n(iii)  If  changing  investment  circumstances  would  result  in  adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts, revise the EMP, resettlement plan, and \nindigenous peoples development plan as applicable, and work with the \nclient to address them. \n(iv)  Require clients to notify the participating bank, PFI, or SIDBI immediately \nof any accidents and incidents that have or are likely to have a material \nadverse effect on the environment, health, or safety of workers or the \n ", "72  Appendix 7 \ncommunity,  including  any  remedial  action  planned  or  taken  by  the \ninvestment company in response to the accident and incident.   \n(v)  If the client fails to comply with its environmental and social commitments, \nas expressed in the legal agreement, work with the client to bring it back \ninto compliance to the extent feasible, and if the client fails to re-establish \ncompliance, exercise remedies when appropriate. \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Management System Capacity  \n \n5.  The ESMS will be established and made operational and will: \n \n(i)  integrate  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard  review  procedure  in  the \nparticipating bank, PFI, or SIDBI appraisal, approval, and monitoring procedure; \n(ii)  provide staff with the necessary safeguard capacity in the participating bank, PFI, \nor SIDBI risk management unit; and \n(iii)  designate  the  participating  bank,  PFI,  or  SIDBI  as  the  decision-making  and \nreviewing authority for the ESMS. \n \nD.  Reporting \n \n6.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nDespite recent rapid economic growth, poverty in India is widespread, and the nation is estimated to have one of the \nlargest concentrations of poor people in the world, totaling a third of the world's poor. According to the criterion used by the \nPlanning Commission of India, 27.5% of the population (or nearly 302 million people) were living below the poverty line in \n2004\u20132005, down from 51.3% in 1977\u20131978, and 36% in 1993\u20131994, a reduction of less than 1% per year.a About 221 \nmillion people (72% of the poor) live in rural areas and most depend on subsistence farming for their livelihood. The \nmajority (59%) of the poor are small landholders, marginal farmers, and landless labors; two thirds of agricultural laborers \nare women. Rural poverty was 28.3% and urban poverty was 25.7% in 2004\u20132005. An estimated 34.3% of the people \nlived on less than $1/day in 2004\u20132005, with 80.4% of people living on less than $2/day.b. According to the World Bank's \nnew estimates based on purchasing power parity exchange rates and domestic prices for 2005, 42% of the population \nlived on less than $1.25/day in 2005 compared with 49.9% in 1993\u20131994. The new estimate also shows that 75.6% people \nlived on less than $2/day in 2005.c Poverty in India is partly attributed to the overconcentration of the workforce in the \nagriculture sector, with corresponding low productivity. In 2007, about 56% of the total population depended on agriculture, \nwhile agriculture contributed 18% to the gross national product. It is anticipated that the slowdown in growth will impact \npoverty. The proposed Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Development Project (the Project) is in line with the priorities \nset out by the Government of India (the Government) in its 11th Five-Year Plan with respect to the micro, small, and \nmedium  enterprise  (MSME)  sector  and,  more  specifically,  to  the  importance  assigned  to  support  for  women\u2019s \nempowerment in the Prime Minister\u2019s 15-point program, and in other flagship schemes of the Government.d \n \nSupport for inclusive growth and the catalyzing of investment through innovative financing modalities has been a critical \nelement in all of India's five year plans, including the ongoing 11th FYP. India's five year plans also emphasize the need to \npromote the financial sector, develop micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME), and support gender equity issues \nand concerns. With respect to MSME development, it is stated that (i) the provision of information, markets, technology, \nand business development services should include mechanisms to promote participation by women and their enterprises; \nand (ii) gender-based barriers to accessing finance should be analyzed and addressed.f The proposed Project will support \naccess by MSMEs to term-finance and capacity-development services. The capacity building grant (CBG), currently under \nconsideration by the Government of Japan (GOJ), will complement the proposed approach under the Project by providing \nmuch-needed capacity development support to low-income microentrepreneurs\u2014most of whom are women\u2014in the \ninformal sector. The CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, will therefore respond to the commitment to a \ngender-inclusive financial sector and small and medium-sized enterprise development by engaging with the Small \nIndustries  Development  Bank  of  India  (SIDBI)  and  its  partner  microfinance  institutions  in  further  advancing  their \ncommitment to the pro-poor, social and gender-inclusive focus of their operations while also addressing the specific needs \nand constraints faced by low-income women entrepreneurs.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis:                                                                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention    \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe MSME sector touches on the lives of many of the most vulnerable in society, including minorities, women, scheduled \ncastes, and scheduled tribes in villages, urban slums, and pockets of poverty in flourishing towns and cities. For many \nfamilies, it is the only source of livelihood, while for others, it supplements family income. Women are mostly found in the \nunregistered sector\u2014food processing enterprises, manufacturing enterprises, and weaving\u2014and often work part time in \nthe family enterprises. Women\u2019s enterprises are micro- and small-scale enterprises managed by one or more women as a \nproprietary concern, or in which they individually or jointly have a share of capital of not less than 51% as partners, \nshareholders, directors of a private limited company, or members of a cooperative society. In India, rural enterprises \nowned by women are smaller, newer, and more likely to be informal and home-based. Female entrepreneurs are less \neducated and have significantly less access to medium- to long-term credit (enterprise finance). Banks and other financial \ninstitutions generally prefer large enterprise clients because of the lower transaction costs and greater availability of \ncollateral. Some of the MSMEs also fall outside the reach of microfinance schemes, and are thus compelled to depend \nmore on informal sources of funds at higher interest rates. The loan officers\u2019 negative attitudes toward and lack of \n ", "76  Appendix 9 \nconfidence in the managerial skills of women entrepreneurs further affects their access to credit. It has been estimated that \nthe limited credit availability for MSMEs in India resulted in the loss of 30 million person-days of potential employment over \na 5-year period. \n \n2.  Design Features \n \nThe proposed intervention will be a very innovative, hybrid program that combines the Asian Development Bank's \nsovereign and nonsovereign lending modalities, and will be complemented with gender and poverty-focused capacity \ndevelopment in initiatives that target the specific needs and constraints faced by low-income female entrepreneurs. The \nProject has been designed to ensure it reaches different segments of the MSME sector. Smaller and newer micro and \nsmall enterprises (MSEs) will be targeted through the loan to SIDBI, while larger medium-sized enterprises that have \nlimited access to bank finance will be targeted under the partial credit guarantee (PCG) facility. The two financing \nmodalities  are  effectively  complementary.  The  PCG  facility  would  help  expose  India's  public  sector  banks  to  the \ninternational capital markets and facilitate capital market development, and also attract additional funds that would be used \nfor the MSME sector, which has great potential to support income and employment generation. The additionality is \nimportant, especially in the context of the Government's enhanced borrowing program, which is partly a result of its \nstimulus package, and has raised concerns regarding crowding out. \n \nEvidence collected during the fact-finding mission and discussions with various government agencies, the private sector, \nand multilateral and bilateral donors suggest that the credit crunch arising from the global economic crisis has accentuated \nthe shortage of credit available to microentrepreneurs (predominantly women) who want to graduate from microfinance \ninstitution support and move into the formal (financial) sector. With this backdrop, offering financing alone will not be \nsufficient  to  target  low-income  women  entrepreneurs.  Based  on  extensive  interaction  with  the  Government, \nnongovernment and other civil society organizations, the need to provide dedicated capacity development support to low-\nincome women micro and small entrepreneurs was identified as critical. These identified needs will be addressed by the \nCBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, of up to $3 million to be financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction (JFPR). In addition to the stated capacity-development initiatives, the JFPR will support innovative approaches \nto promoting women's microentrepreneurship in selected states with high poverty levels and weak capacity. \n \nII.          SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe debate on provision of financial services to poor and low-income households in India has revolved around the rural \npopulation since India\u2019s banks were first nationalized. Unlike rural financial intermediation, the flow of financial resources to \nurban populations was never seriously debated in India. The tendency among microfinance intermediaries to move \ntowards urban centers arose only after rural markets were saturated. The self-help group-bank linkage model remains \npredominantly a rural phenomena, however. The first targeted credit program with a focus on enterprise and self-\nemployment opportunities in urban areas was launched in 1989 during the 7th Five-Year Plan period (1985\u20131990). The \nvarious urban poverty alleviation schemes with a credit focus introduced in India since 1989 have broadly followed a top-\ndown approach.g The flow of credit from formal financial institutions to urban population groups increased steadily in India \nsince the 1970s, and this has come to be concentrated in large cities and upper credit brackets. Although social banking \nefforts undertaken by the central bank and the Government\u2019s financial intermediation in rural areas have undergone an \nexpansion phase, the overall expansion in financial intermediation has largely bypassed low-income, asset-holding \npopulations in urban areas. While the state\u2019s poverty alleviation approach has steadily expanded from mere provision of \nbasic amenities and services to facilitating creation of income-earning opportunities, it has failed to significantly impact the \nurban poor. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nDuring fact-finding, the mission team reached out to government organizations, multilateral and bilateral donor partners \nand  grassroots  women's  associations  to  learn  about  existing  government-supported  schemes  targeting  female \nentrepreneurs, and engaged extensively with the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises and the Ministry of \nWomen and Child Development (National Credit Fund for Women, or Rashtriya Mahila Kosh). Partnership with both \nRashtriya Mahila Kosh and the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises will be sought throughout the Project to \nensure  (i)  cross-fertilization  of  experience  among  participating  financial  institutions  and  SIDBI,  and  (ii)  effective \nincorporation by the SIDBI Foundation for Microfinance of promising practices within their policies, strategies, and \nprograms. The JFPR-financed CBG, currently under consideration by the GOJ, will be provided broad opportunities for \ninteraction among these financial partners on issues related to social inclusion and gender equality. \n \n ", "Appendix 9  77\n2.

Key Issues \n \nWomen\u2019s enterprises are small-scale enterprises managed by one or more women as a proprietary concern, or in which \nthey individually or jointly have a of share capital of not less than 51% as partners, shareholders, directors of a private \nlimited company, or members of a cooperative society. Evidence collected during the fact-finding mission and discussions \nwith various government agencies, private sector, and multilateral and bilateral donors suggests that the credit crunch \narising  from  the  global  economic  crisis  has  accentuated  the  shortage  of  credit  faced  by  low-income  female \nmicroentrepreneurs,  and  especially  those  located  in  urban  and  semiurban  settings,  with  severe  repercussions  on \nlivelihoods. MSMEs play an important role in the nonfarm sector as a means for sustainable employment. In achieving \nthese outcomes, MSMEs benefit women both directly, in terms of wages, and indirectly by supplementing family incomes, \nreducing drudgery, and providing sustainable social capital. \n \n2.
