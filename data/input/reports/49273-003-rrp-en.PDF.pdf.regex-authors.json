THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  We seek your approval to administer a grant in the amount of $10,165,0001 for the \nadditional financing of the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project (the Project) \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, to be provided by the Women Entrepreneurs \nFinance Initiative (We-Fi).2 The report also describes administration of a grant in the amount of \n$2,386,800  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  attached  technical  assistance  (TA)3 to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, to be provided by We-Fi, and if you approve the \nproposed administration of the grant for the Project, the Director General, South Asia Department, \nacting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, approves the administration of the grant \nfor the TA.  \n \nII.  THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n2.  On 15 February 2016, the Board approved Loan 3370 in the amount of $100,000,000 from \nordinary capital resources (regular loan) for the Project, with an attached TA in the amount of \n$2,000,000 financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered \nby ADB.4 On 15 January 2018, the Board approved Loan 3640 in the amount $75,000,000 from \nordinary capital resources (regular loan) for additional financing of the Project.5 10 participating \nfinancial institutions (PFIs)6 are financial intermediaries of the Project with small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) as end-beneficiaries. The Project finances subloans to qualified SMEs \nthrough the PFIs. \n \n3.  The ongoing project\u2019s impact will be employment opportunities in SMEs increased.7 Its \noutcome will be SMEs\u2019 access to finance strengthened. The ongoing project has the following \noutputs: (i) financing to SMEs through formal intermediaries increased; (ii) innovative SME \nfinancing schemes developed; (iii) capacity of SMEs in targeted clusters to access financial \nservices enhanced; and (iv) international competitiveness of the information and communication \ntechnology (ICT)-business process outsourcing (BPO) cluster strengthened.  \n \n4.  The ongoing project is on track to achieve its outcome of strengthened SMEs\u2019 access to \nfinance;  has  been  satisfactory  on  implementation  progress;  has  consistently  surpassed  its \ndevelopment targets of lending to subborrowers outside Colombo, first time borrowers and to \nwomen-led  SMEs;  has complied  with  safeguard  policy  requirements; and  has  successfully \nmanaged risks. \n                                                \n1  This amount includes $9,500,000 million to provide grants for principal paydown support to eligible women-led SMEs \nand $665,000 of administrative fee for ADB.  \n2  We-Fi was launched on 12 October 2017 as an international financial intermediary fund to address financial and \nnonfinancial constraints faced by women-led small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. \nIt aims to mobilize more than $1.0 billion in financing from international financial institutions and the private sector. \nWe-Fi is governed by a Governing Committee comprising 14 founding contributing countries that have committed \nover $340 million to date and is administered by a secretariat at the World Bank. \n3  The proposed increase in the budget and change in scope of the TA are described in Appendix 2 (Attached Technical \nAssistance). \n4 ADB.  2016.

For \nthe $75.0 million additional financing approved in January 2018, the government has submitted a \nwithdrawal request for $25.0 million, and this first allocation is expected to disburse by 30 June \n2018.  \n \nIII.  THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n6.  The first additional financing to the ongoing project was approved by the Board on 15 \nJanuary 2018, and the proposed We-Fi financing materialized only after such approval. The \nongoing project is performing well and the proposed We-Fi additional financing will be used to \nexpand the gender dimensions of the Project.  \n  \n7.  Women-led SMEs face significant barriers for access to finance. The International Finance \nCorporation has identified Sri Lanka\u2019s gender gap in micro, small, and medium enterprise \nfinancing at $350 million. The Government of Sri Lanka has prioritized financial inclusion for SMEs. \nThe 2018\u20132022 Country Partnership Strategy identified SME financing as an area of focus.8 \n \n8.  The We-Fi grant funding increases the ongoing project\u2019s benefit to women-led SMEs in \nSri Lanka by improving access to finance for underserved women-led SMEs through a $9,500,000 \ngrant for principal paydown support.  \n \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n \n9.  Impact and outcome. The We-Fi-funded second additional financing will enhance the \ngender dimensions of the ongoing project, as the We-Fi funded additional financing component \nis categorized as Gender Equity as a Theme (GEN), an upgrade from the ongoing project which \nwill remain categorized as Effective Gender Mainstreaming (EGM). The impact of the overall \nproject including the We-Fi additional financing will remain increased employment opportunities \nin SMEs.9 The outcome will remain strengthened SMEs\u2019 access to finance. With the We-FI \nadditional financing, at least $27.1 million of blended financing support, from both the We-Fi grant \nand the ongoing project, will be provided to women-led SMEs by 2020. Additional gender targets \nhave been included in the Design and Monitoring Framework (DMF) to reflect the project\u2019s \nenhanced gender focus through the We-Fi financing.10 \n \n10.  Outputs.11 The ongoing project\u2019s outputs including financing to SMEs through formal \nintermediaries increased (Output 1), innovative SME financing schemes developed (Output 2), \nand international competitiveness of ICT-BPO cluster strengthened (Output 4) will remain largely \nunchanged.  \n \n11.  With the first additional financing of $75,000,000, Output (3) has been expanded to \nenhanced capacity of all SMEs to access financial services. With the proposed increase in the \namount and scope of the attached TA to be grant-financed by We-Fi, at least 250 actual and \npotential women entrepreneurs from SMEs across all industries will be trained in business \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2017.

The proposed increase in the amount and scope of the attached TA amount to be financed \nby We-Fi on a grant basis, will support the delivery of two new outputs: (i) gender-inclusive policy \nand regulatory framework and support enhanced (Output 5), and (ii) evidence base on women \nentrepreneurship development strengthened to inform future policymaking (Output 6). Activities \nenvisaged to achieve these outputs include gap assessment and development plan on gender \npolicies and processes for PFIs, government agencies, and civil society organizations; a policy \npaper on women entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka; rigorous impact evaluation; and development \ncommunications strategy. See Appendix 1 for revised DMF.  \n \nC.  Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative Additional Financing \n \n13.  A call for gender-focused SME project proposals was made by the We-Fi Secretariat on \n11 October 2017, with a submission deadline of 15 December 2017. A grant project proposal was \ndeveloped to complement the ongoing project because of its strong track record and focus on \nwomen entrepreneurship. On 19 April 2018, the Governing Committee officially approved the \nproject proposal and awarded a grant, based on the ongoing project\u2019s track record,12 government \nownership, and availability of data that began during the ongoing project.13 \n \n14.  Investment and financing plans. The ongoing project includes the $100,000,000 original \nproject and $75,000,000 of first additional financing. With the proposed We-Fi additional financing \ngrant, the total project cost is estimated to be $185,165,000.

The We-Fi grant-funded $9,500,00014 support for principal paydown of individual loans \nundertaken by women-led SMEs will be disbursed in three equal tranches of $3,170,000 each \ntogether with ADB\u2019s $25,000,000 per tranche disbursement for its additional financing (Table 2).15  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n12 The Project has also consistently exceeded its financial inclusion targets of lending to first time borrowers, women-\nled SMEs, and other targeted SMEs. See also para. 4 and para. 5. \n13 The proposal was one of the three successful proposals out of the seven submitted by multilateral development \nbanks and was the sole single-country proposal approved. \n14 $10.165 million includes ADB\u2019s administrative fee of $665,000. \n15 After the completion of the seventh funding round, ADB will decide, in consultation with the government, on the use \nof any unused grant funds under the principal paydown component. Priority of uses for any such remaining funds will \nbe another SME project in Sri Lanka, an SME project in another SARD country, or blending with funds from the PFIs.

Implementation arrangements. The We-Fi grant will be implemented from June 2018 to \n31 December 2019. The grant project and the current project will have the same executing agency, \nthe Ministry of Finance and Mass Media. The We-Fi grant will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  The government will disburse $9,500,000 of the We-Fi grant for principal paydown support \nin local currency equivalent through PFIs. The PFIs will then provide the grants for principal \npaydown support to eligible women-led SMEs. Women-led SMEs eligible for the We-Fi funded \n20% principal paydown grant support must meet the following criteria:  \n \n(i)  at least 51% of the enterprise ownership is controlled by women, or meets the \nbelow three criteria: \n(a)  at least 20% of the enterprise ownership is controlled by women; \n(b)  a woman is either the chief executive officer (i.e., senior most manager) or \nchief operations officer (i.e., second most senior manager); and  \n(c)  30% of the board members are women, where a board exists. \n(ii)  The loan principal is at least Rs750,000.16  \n \n18.  The We-Fi grant will also finance eligible women-led SME borrowers for an additional: (i) \n10% principal paydown of individual loan if they complete the associated training, and (ii) 5% of \nprincipal  paydown  of  individual  loan  if  women-led  subborrowers  are  accessing  finance  for \neconomic activity in the regions within the Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Northern, and Eastern provinces. \nWe-Fi grant financing for eligible women-led SMEs is, cumulatively, subject to a ceiling of \nRs17,500,000 for each individual loan transaction contingent on the conditions set out above.  \n \n19.  Assurances. The government and the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media have assured \nADB that implementation of the grant shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and grant documents.  \n \n20.  The government and the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media have agreed with ADB on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  grant  agreement  and  project \nagreements.  \n \n21.  Due diligence. The proposed We-Fi additional financing grant will leverage on the due \ndiligence conducted for the ongoing project including poverty and social dimensions, PFIs\u2019 \nfinancial strength, and safeguards.  \n \n                                                \n16 The exchange rate is fixed at Rs150 unless otherwise adjusted by the SME steering committee.  ", "5 \nD.  Technical Assistance  \n \n22.  An attached transaction TA of $2,000,000 financed on a grant basis by JFPR is supporting \nthe delivery of project outputs. It has funded the administration of the auction, study on the \nintroduction of an SME credit guarantee scheme and development of three industry clusters (ICT-\nBPO, fruits and vegetables, and processed food and beverage) in Sri Lanka.17  \n \n23.  A $2,386,80018 increase in the attached TA is proposed to finance an increase in the \noverall project\u2019s gender dimensions by: (i) strengthening gender-inclusive policy and regulatory \nframeworks, business practices, and networks; (ii) building business capacity of women-led \nSMEs; and (iii) strengthening the evidence base on women entrepreneurship to inform future \npolicymaking. The increased TA scope will support the delivery of expanded activities under the \nProject as described in para. 10-12 and in Appendix 2.  \n \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n24.  It is recommended that the President approves the administration of a grant in the amount \nof $10,165,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of \nthe Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project, to be provided by the Women \nEntrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi).  \n                                                \n17ADB.  2016.

The administration of a technical assistance (TA) grant in the \namount of $2,000,000 was approved on 15 February 2016 for an attached TA to SRI: Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project (the Project). The TA is estimated to cost \n$2,000,000, of which $2,000,000 is financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. \n  \n2.  The TA comprises the following two components: Component 1 (administration of the \nauction system and study of the introduction of an SME credit guarantee scheme in Sri Lanka) \nwould  support  the  Project\u2019s  output  2  (innovative  SME  financing  schemes  developed);  and \nComponent 2 (development of three industry clusters). Component 2 would support business \ndevelopment and financial services for female entrepreneurs in all three industry clusters to \nsupport the Project\u2019s output 3 (capacity of SMEs in targeted clusters to access financial services \nenhanced) and would support branding and promotion of female participation in the ICT-BPO \ncluster  to  support  the  project\u2019s  output  4  (international  competitiveness  of  ICT-BPO  cluster \nstrengthened).  \n \n3.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Mass  Media  (MOF)  is  the  executing  agency.  MOF\u2019s \nDepartment of Development Finance is the implementing agency for Component 1 and the Export \nDevelopment Board (EDB) is the implementing agency for Component 2. The TA was made \neffective 27 April 2016 and is expected to be completed on 30 June 2020.  \n \nB.  Current Status of TA Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  The TA is on track for completion by June 2020. All the activities envisaged under \nComponent 1 has been completed. About half of the activities designed to be conducted under \nComponent 2 has been completed. Other key initiatives such as the training of 500 actual and \npotential female entrepreneurs in targeted sectors, and the facilitation of the participation of at \nleast 500 women in career events on working in the ICT-BPO cluster is ongoing and on-track for \ncompletion by the TA\u2019s current completion date of 30 June 2020. Of the $2,000,000, $1,880,000 \nhas been contracted and $778,000 has been disbursed. See Attachment 3 for progress of TA \nimplementation.  \n  \nC.  Proposed Changes in TA Scope and Implementation  \n \n5.  A $2,386,800 increase in the TA amount to be financed on a grant basis by the Women \nEntrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) and a minor change in scope and implementation \narrangements are proposed for the TA to support the enhancement of the gender dimensions of \nthe ongoing project and the We-Fi grant. These will upgrade the gender categorization of the \nproject from Effective Gender Mainstreaming (EGM) to Gender Equity as a theme (GEN). The \nwider  gender  dimensions  will  benefit  women-led  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka  through  four  major \ncomponents:  \n \n(i)  Component  1:  Access  to  finance  for  underserved  women-led  SMEs \nimproved. The TA will support the project\u2019s output 1 (financing to SMEs through \nformal intermediaries increased). At least 7 out of 10 of the ongoing project\u2019s \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) will complete a gender gap assessment of \ntheir policies, products and processes, and have introduced new gender-inclusive ", "Appendix 2  13 \npolicies, products and processes to better serve women-led SME borrowers. \n(ii)  Component  2:  Gender-inclusive  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks, \nbusiness  practices,  and  networks  strengthened.  The  TA  will  support  the \nproject\u2019s output 5 (gender-inclusive policy and regulatory framework and support \nenhanced). At least 3 government agencies and 2 civil society organizations are \nto develop action plans to support women entrepreneurship leveraging on findings \nfrom gender gap needs assessment.  \n(iii)  Component  3:  Business  capacity  of  women-led  SMEs  enhanced.  This \ncomponent of the TA will increase support for the project\u2019s output 3 (capacity of \nSMEs to access financial services enhanced) and the ongoing TA\u2019s component 2 \n(gender-inclusive policies and regulatory frameworks, business practices, and \nnetworks strengthened). In addition to the women entrepreneurs from selected \nindustries identified for capacity building in the TA, at least an additional 250 \npotential and existing women entrepreneurs from all industries will be trained in \nbusiness  development  and  management.  Further,  at  least  450  women \nentrepreneurs will be registered on the online learning and development, and \nmentoring platform.  \n(iv)  Component 4: Evidence base on women entrepreneurship strengthened. \nThis TA component will support the overall project\u2019s output 6 (evidence base on \nwomen  entrepreneurship  strengthened).  Focus  group  discussions  and  one \nrigorous  impact  evaluation  including  baseline  and  endline  surveys  will  be \nundertaken. Further, a policy paper on the challenges to women entrepreneurship \nin Sri Lanka will be submitted to the SME steering committee. At least four success \nstories of women-led SMEs that have benefitted from We-Fi grant financing will be \ndocumented. At least 4 national and regional seminars in total will be held to \ndisseminate findings to inform future policymaking on women entrepreneurship \ndevelopment. \n \n6.  Implementation arrangements. The TA completion date is proposed to be extended \nfrom 30 June 2020 to 14 February 2021. ADB will administer the We-Fi-funded grant, similar to \nthe current arrangements for the current TA. All procurement of goods and services, and \nprocurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Finance and Mass Media will continue to be the executing agency of this \nscaled-up TA. MOF\u2019s Department of Development Finance will be the implementing agency for \nthe We-Fi-funded components 1, 2, and 4 of the TA. The National Enterprise Development \nAuthority (NEDA) will be the implementing agency for the We-Fi-funded component 3 (business \ncapacity of women-led SMEs enhanced) of this TA.  \n \n8.  Consulting  services.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  and  carry  out  procurement \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Consultants will procure the necessary \nworks and goods as applicable.  \n   \n9.  ADB will recruit one individual consultant to be financed by the We-Fi grant and to be \nbased in the Sri Lanka Resident Mission as project manager. A time-based contract will be used \nfor the individual consultant. ADB will also recruit 2 consulting firms: one for TA output 3, and \nanother for TA outputs 1, 2, and 4. The 2 consulting firms will be recruited using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with a standard technical-finance evaluation cost ratio of 90:10. An \noutput-based (lumpsum) contract will be used for the 2 consulting firms.

Due diligence. The ADB-administered additional financing grant TA will leverage on the \ndue diligence conducted for the ongoing project including that of the PFIs\u2019 financial strength, \npoverty and social, and safeguards aspects.  \n \nD.  Increase in the TA Amount \n \n11.  The current budget of the TA is proposed to be increased by $2,386,800 of which \n$2,386,800 will be financed on a grant basis by We-Fi. Of the $2,386,800, $2,244,0001 will be for \nthe TA components and $142,800 will be administrative fees2 for ADB. The disbursement of TA \nfinancing will be on a cost-sharing basis. See Attachment 1 for cost estimates and financing plan.  \n \nE.  Staff Views  \n \n12.  The change in scope and implementation arrangements are considered minor as these \ndo  not  substantially  affect  the  TA\u2019s  outcome,  components,  benefits,  or  implementation \narrangements.
