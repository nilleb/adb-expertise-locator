Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEE)  undertaken.  Summary  IEE  is \ngiven in Appendix 13. \n \ninvestment  program \nThe \ncombines physical investments in new generating capacity across \nfour  provinces \nin  several  subsectors  and  nonphysical \ninterventions  in  policy  reform,  capacity  development,  fiduciary \noversight  and  governance,  regulatory  and  legal  frameworks, \nknowledge \nprocurement, \ndisbursements,  project  implementation,  evaluation,  supervision, \nmonitoring and reporting.  \n \nThe investment program is the first of its kind in Pakistan. It is also \none of the first to be developed under Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) evolving clean energy and environment initiative.  \n \nThe  investment  program  has  its  context  in  a  road  map  for  the \nenergy  sector  as  a  whole,  in  itself  a  product  of  diagnostic  work \nover  recent  years.  The  starting  premise  for  this  work  is  a \nrecognition  that  power  and  energy  represent,  together  with \ntransport  connectivity  and  water,  major  bottlenecks  to  high  and \ninclusive economic growth in the country. Energy supplies are far \ntoo dependent on oil imports, the cost of which accounts for a big \nshare of the total import bill. Pakistan needs to be more efficient in \nenergy  use,  but  also  to  generate  more  power  domestically\u2014\nthrough the use of indigenous resources and by changing the mix \ntowards  renewable  resources.  The  diagnostic  work  identified  key \nconstraints, challenges, and opportunities. This paved the way for \ndefining  a  strategic  framework,  a  new  policy  agenda,  and  action \nplans  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  The  action  plans  are \nsequenced  and  complementary,  with  transactions  involving  the \nprivate and public sectors, debt and equity finance, and technical \nassistance.  \n \nNationwide power demand is outstripping supply, a trend likely to \ncontinue  unabated  for  some  time.  To  balance  these,  Pakistan \nneeds \nfrom  15,500  MW \n(megawatts) in 2005 to 162,590 MW by 2030. \n\nincrease  production  capacity \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAbout 99,000 MW of this is likely to come from thermal power, i.e., \ncoal, oil, and gas. But the balance could be met from hydropower \nand  renewable  energy,  which  potentially  are  environmentally \nfriendlier.  Hydro  includes  large,  medium  and  small  plants.  This \nprogram  focuses  on  small  to  medium  plants  with  significant \nenvironmental benefits. \n \nTotal generation capacity from renewable energy (RE) is currently \nat a low 180 MW. But there is considerable scope and opportunity \nto increase it to 9,700 MW by 2030. This will raise RE\u2019s profile and \nits  contribution  to  the  total  energy  mix  to  6%.  This  contribution \nwould  be  much  higher  were  medium  to  large  hydropower \ngeneration facilities to be included under the RE package.  \n \nPakistan\u2019s  renewable  energy  potential  is  greatest  in  the  case  of  \nsmall  to  medium-sized  hydropower  plants,  but  wind,  solar,  and \nbiomass resources also have potential. Hydropower resources are \nlocated  mainly  in  the  northern  and  central  parts  of  the  country, \nwind and solar resources in the southern provinces of Sindh and \nBalochistan, \nrespectively.  Pakistan\u2019s  vast  agricultural  base \nprovides ample opportunities to develop biomass-based energy. \n \nRE  delivers  on  four  strategic  objectives  given  in  Pakistan\u2019s \nMedium  Term  Development  Framework  (MTDF):  (i)  greater \nenergy  security;  (ii)  reasonable  economic  and  financial  returns; \n(iii) improved social equity, especially in rural areas; and (iv) clean \nenergy and environmental sustainability.  \n \nThe  investment  program  for  the  power  sector  as  a  whole  is \nestimated  to  be  $150  billion  (2006\u20132030)  with  $2.2  billion \nexpected  for  RE.  Of  RE,  half  would  be  run-of-the-river  hydro \nplants.  The  rest  is  assigned  to  wind  energy,  solar  power,  and \nbiomass.  The  financing  plan  involves  federal  and  provincial \ngovernment  budgets,  but  also  the  private  sector  and  institutions \nsuch as ADB.  \n \nThe  fund-raising  strategy  calls  for  a  minimum  critical  mass  but \nalso  for  certainty  and  diversity  of  funding  sources.  A  program  of \nthis  nature  cannot  be  easily  supported  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  i.e., \nthrough  stand-alone  projects  processed  every  two  to  three  years \nin different sectors and different parts of the country. The integrity \nof the investment program as a whole demands a partnership and \ncontinuity.  It  also  means  flexibility  with  regard  to  subproject \nchoice,  a  linkage  of  finance  to  project  preparedness,  financial \ndiscipline,  and  maturing  physical  investments  with  policy  and \ncapacity.  It  is  in  this  context  that  the  authorities  requested  ADB \nsupport  for  the  program  in  the  form  of  a  multitranche  financing \nfacility  (MFF).  Such  support  provides  a  platform  for  financial  as \nwell  as  expert  assistance,  blending \nreform  and  capacity \ndevelopment with investments.  \n \n\n\f \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n \nCapacity Development \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    iii \n\nThe RE sector is backed by a policy framework. This is the result \nof diagnostic work that led to the sector road map and investment \nprogram.  The  framework  has  measures  for  each  of  the  four  RE \nsubsectors and provinces. It distinguishes between policies at the \nfederal  and  provincial \nlevels.  North-West  Frontier  Province \n(NWFP)  and  Punjab  have  already  completed  their  draft  policies. \nThe other two provinces are working on theirs.  \n \nPreparation  of  the  final  policy  framework  and  implementation  in \neach province (as well as at the federal level) will be supported by \na  special  technical  assistance  package  financed  under  the  MFF. \nThere  will  be  a  cross-conditionality  between  investments,  future \nfunding  from  ADB  and  RE  policy  reforms.  Policies  are  purposely \nbroad  to  start  with;  and  not  \u201ccast  in  stone\u201d.  The  starting  point  is \nestablishment of basic principles and criteria for RE development. \nDuring  the  implementation  phase,  adjustments  are  possible  and \nlikely. Enabling conditions will thus differ in scope and depth over \nthe \ntime.  The  program  represents  a  partnership  between \nGovernment and ADB. This means that ADB and others will have \nample  opportunities  to  suggest  changes.  For  this  to  happen, \nsound  monitoring  and  reporting  is  a  precondition.  The  process \nneeds  good  information.  Changes  to  the  framework  will  be \nreported on a regular basis to ADB\u2019s Management and the Board. \n \nThe  diagnostic  work  undertaken  in  support  of  the  program \nfederal,  provincial,  and \nidentified  weak  capacity  at \nimplementation  agency  levels.  Weaknesses  differ  in  importance \nand  magnitude,  but  include  policy  formulation,  planning,  project \npreparation, \noversight, \ngovernance  in  the  broader  sense  (incentives  to  private  sector \ninvestment),  procedures,  systems,  safeguards,  and  procurement. \nThere is also weakness with regard to evaluation, monitoring, and \nreporting. The latter include procedures, systems and expertise.  \n \nThe \nstrong  capacity \ndevelopment  component.  This  will  support  executing  agencies \n(EAs)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  alike.  Key  result  areas \ninclude (i) information, planning, policy framework formulation and \nrevisions thereof; (ii) human resources development and training; \n(iii)  sector  and \ntechnical \nfeasibility  studies,  and  RE  resource  assessments;  (iv)  systems \nand procedures for project supervision, monitoring, and reporting; \n(v)  due  diligence  and  mitigation  plans  (with  emphasis  on \nsafeguards); \nfinancial \nfiduciary  oversight, \nmanagement,  procurement,  anticorruption  measures,  and \ngovernance;  (ix)  project  management,  including  accounting  and \nauditing;  and  (x)  outreach  work,  including  communications  and \npublic relations. \n \nThe Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) will act as the \nmain  counterpart  for  ADB  financing  and  for  the  program.  Actual \nday-to-day  work  in  the  sector  will  be  the  mandate  of  specialized \nRE agencies at the provincial level.  \n \n\nthematic  due  diligence, \n\nfinancial  management, \n\ninvestment  program \n\nincludes  a \n\nincluding \n\nincluding \n\nfiduciary \n\nthe \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\nFramework Financing \nAgreement \n\nfor  Technical  Cooperation \n\nADB  is  not  acting  alone.  The  World  Bank  and  United  States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) will work with ADB \non  capacity  development.  USAID  will  also  provide  direct  support \nto the South Asia Regional Energy Initiative for Energy and assist \nsector  agencies  with  collecting  and  assessing  wind  data.  Finally, \nAEDB is already receiving specialized technical support from the \nGerman  Agency \n(Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit),  primarily  with \nproject preparation techniques.  \n \nThe Government has requested $510 million from ADB to support \nthe  program.  This  is  to  be  structured  around  an  MFF  with  a  life \nspan  of  10  years.  This  financing  represents  23%  of  the  total \nfinancing  plan.  The  MFF  will  allow  the  authorities  to  finance \nindividual  projects  as  the  projects  and  conditions  warrant  by \nlinking financing to project readiness, reforms, capacity, and work \non  various  themes.  Individual  periodic  financing  requests  (PFR) \nwill be the means to convert parts of the MFF into individual loans. \nThe authorities underwrite to ADB their adherence in full and at all \ntimes  of  basic  policies  and  procedures  via  warranties  and \nrepresentations  made  in  a  Framework  Financing  Agreement \nthe  capacity  development \n(FFA)  and  with  assistance  of \ncomponent.  These  warranties  and  representations  cover  basic \ntechnical  operating  principles  at  the  subproject  level,  criteria  and \nrules  related  to  broad  sector  development  in  the  broader  sense,  \nsubproject  criteria  and  the  application  of  all  standard  and \nprevailing  ADB  policies  and  procedures  regarding  safeguards, \ngovernance,  anticorruption,  financial  management,  procurement, \nand disbursement. To help agencies comply with these warranties \nand  representations,  the  Government  accepts  the  fielding  of \nteams of experts under the capacity development component. The \nteams will include expertise to carry out quality due diligence but \nalso  modern  management  techniques  to  execute  changes  and \nreport  on  results.  Safeguards,  governance,  and  procurement  are \nareas  where  the  greatest  help  is  required.  ADB  will  also  provide \ndirect  advice  on  a  regular  basis  through  its  own  program \nimplementation  missions.  This  transaction  requires,  and  will \nreceive, higher than average attention from ADB teams. Capacity \ndevelopment is one of the main success factors.  \n \nThe  Government  has  entered  into  an  FFA  with  ADB  for  the \npurposes  of  the  investment  program.  The  FFA  satisfies  the \nrequirements set forth in Appendix 4 of the Board Paper on Pilot \nFinancing  Instruments  and  Modalities.  Pursuant  to  the  FFA,  the \nGovernment  has  submitted  to  ADB  a  first  PFR  in  an  amount  of \n$115 million. The first PFR is presented to the Board together with \nthe MFF and the FFA.  \n \nThe  FFA  records  the  full  set  of  warranties  and  representations \nhighlighted  above.  These  cover  ADB  operating  policies  and \nprocedures on all crosscutting themes.  \n \nPrior  to  ADB  acceptance  of  a  PFR,  it  is  understood  that  the \nGovernment and participating provinces and their RE agencies \n\n\f \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \nFirst PFR \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\n    v \n\nis \n\nto \n\nfeatures  of \n\ncompatible  with \n\nto  comply  with  any  of \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  poverty \n\nteams  will  provide  ongoing  guidance \n\nwill ensure they comply in full with the terms and conditions of the \nFFA.  The  capacity  development  component  will  provide  support.  \nIt  will  do  so  by  helping  with  specific  due  diligence  and  with  the \ndevelopment  of  corresponding  mitigation  plans.  ADB  teams  will \nevaluate all funding requests and check these to ensure that they \nsatisfactorily adhere to representations made and will continue to \ndo  so.  ADB \nthe \nauthorities,  and,  if  needed,  make  available  additional  experts \nunder the capacity development component. ADB staff will report \nto  the  Government,  Management  and  the  Board  on  the status  of \nindividual  loans,  including  the  performance  on  warranties  and \nrepresentations.  Failure \nthese  will \nautomatically hold back additional finance under the MFF.  \n \nThe  Government  has  delegated  authority  to  the  provinces  to \ndevelop power generating capacity of up to 50 MW. RE programs \nare  a  means  to  deliver  this  mandate.  In  May  2005,  the \nGovernment announced a target calling for RE to reach 3.5% and \n6.0%  of  the  total  energy  supply  mix  by  2015  and  2030, \nrespectively.  RE  development \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  twin  goals  of  energy  security  and  promoting \nindigenous resource utilization. RE development is also one of the \nkey \nreduction  and \nenvironmental agendas. RE supports electrification in remote and \nrural  areas,  including  those  not  covered  by  the  main  grid. \nEmployment  generation  and  improvements  in  social  well-being \nare two by-products of RE development.  \n \nThe investment program will contribute to economic development \nthrough  expanded  power  supply,  especially  in  rural  areas.  It  will \ngenerate  energy  equivalent  to  1,700  gigawatt-hours  (GWh) \nannually,  sufficient \nto  serve  about  600,000  new  domestic \nconsumers.  It  will  improve  the  reliability  and  quality  of  supply.  It \nwill also increase the utilization of clean and RE-based power. \n \nThe  MFF  transaction is  accompanied  by  a  first  PFR  to  finance  a \nset  of  subprojects  prepared  by  the  provinces  and  ready  for \nto \nimplementation.  The \nmedium-sized hydropower plants in NWFP and Punjab. This first \nloan  also  covers  capacity  development.  The \nis \nrepresentative  of  others  to  be  forthcoming  and  takes  in  three \nmajor areas: \n \nClean  Energy  Development.  This  includes  expansion  of  small \nhydropower  generating  capacity.  The  main  components  are \nconstruction of thee grid-connected plants in NWFP ranging from \n2.6  MW  to  36  MW  and  five  small  to  medium-sized  hydropower \nstations  in  Punjab  ranging  from  3.2  MW  to  7.2  MW.  The  total \ncapacity will be about 75 MW, which will generate about 400 GWh \nof annual energy output.  \n\ninvestments  comprise  mainly  small \n\nfirst  PFR \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntheir \n\nin  particular  on \n\nterms  of  reference, \n\n \nFeasibility Studies and Other Due Diligence of New Sites. The \nfirst  PFR  will  support  preparation  of  eight  additional  feasibility \nstudies  involving  new  sites  in  NWFP  (three)  and  Punjab  (five). \nThese will be converted into subprojects for financing under a new \nPFR.  The  feasibility  studies  include  due  diligence  on  technical, \nfinancial,  commercial,  regulatory,  operational,  governance,  legal, \nfiduciary oversight, safeguards, procurement, and implementation \nmatters. The work will be carried out by teams of experts. ADB will \nthe \nadvise  on \nrequirements to comply with ADB operating rules and procedures. \n \nCapacity  Development. This component will support work at the \nfederal,  provincial,  and  project  levels  and  provide  for  better \nplanning,  policy  work,  training,  financial  management,  fiduciary \noversight, \ninstitutional  strengthening,  project \nmanagement, safeguards, evaluation, monitoring, and reporting.

Whereas  the  feasibility  study  work  above \nfocuses  on  project  preparation,  backed  by  due  diligence  on \nvarious  project  related  areas  (identifying  risks  and  mitigation \nplans), the capacity development component combines help to the \nagencies \ntoday  with \ndevelopment  for  the  future  of  smart  and  sustainable  planning, \npolicy  formulation,  systems,  procedures,  institutions,  and  trained \npeople,  as  well  as  sound  criteria  and  rules  to  ensure  sector \ngrowth, efficiency, effectiveness and results.  \n \nThe total cost of the RE program runs to $2.2 billion.

SHYDO  has  established  one  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), which is in its main office in Peshawar. \nThe  PMU  director  and  field-level  project  managers  have  already \nbeen  appointed.  They  report  all  subproject-related  matters  to  the \nDirector, Planning and Facilitation of SHYDO, who is ex-officio the \noverall coordinator for the NWFP component. \n \nA  PMU  has  also  been  established  in  Punjab  IPD,  headed  by  a \nproject director. Several key staff members have been assigned to \ncarry  out  preparatory  work,  including  documentation  to  approve \nProject  Concepts-1,  initial  environmental  examinations,  and  the \nexecution  of  resettlement  plans.  The  team  will  also  undertake \nlater  handle \nadvance  actions \nprocurement.

A  draft  charter  of  the  company,  the \nPunjab  Power  Development  Company  Limited,  has  been \nprepared. The Province has endorsed the plan and it is expected \nthat  the  company  will  be  legally  established,  fully  staffed,  and \nfunctioning  before  31  December  2006.  Once  the  company  is \noperational,  the  tasks  of  the  PMU  will  be  taken  over  by  the \ncompany and therefore the company will become the IA.  \n \nEquipment  and  materials  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines, \n2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  International  competitive \nbidding (ICB) will be used for turnkey contracts for construction of \nall  hydropower  plants  and  for  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost \nthe  equivalent  of  or  more  than  $1.5  million.  Limited  international \nbidding will be used for supply contracts estimated at $100,000 to \n$1.0  million,  and  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be  used \nfor  contracts  worth  less  than  $100,000.  Civil  works  contracts \nestimated at less than $1.0 million will be procured following NCB \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Contract  packages  will  be \nprepared  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under  ICB.  Similar \ncontractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to \nother subprojects.  \n \nThe proceeds of individual loans under the MFF will be disbursed \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \nADB\u2019s  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, both as periodically amended. \n \nConsulting services will be required for (i) design, supervision, and \nmanagement  under  Part  A;  (ii)  feasibility  studies  under  Part  B; \nand(iii)  capacity  development  under  Part  C.  Consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged in accordance with Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers, 2006, as amended from \ntime  to  time.  Services  will  be  provided  through  consulting  firms \nchosen  by  international  competition  using  the  quality  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method.  Individual  experts  may  be  recruited \nbased  on  biodata  submitted  in  response  to  specific  terms  of \nreference for the assignment. \n  \nThe investment program is designed to benefit all grid-connected \nconsumers of electricity by expanding electric power supplies and \nwill  enable  the  Government  to  meet  its  objective  of  universal \nelectrification  under  the  so-called  \u201cRoshan  Pakistan  Program\u201d  or \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Village Electrification Program. Electricity \nfrom  small \nthe \nto  medium-sized  hydropower  plants  under \ninvestment program will directly go to the local grids (mostly to 11-\nkV  lines  but  one  to  a  132-kV),  contributing  to  this  key  policy \nobjective  and  helping  fulfill  provincial  demand.  The  overall \nobjective  of  expanding  clean  energy  capacity  will  generate  local, \nregional,  and  global  environmental  benefits.  Local  air  quality, \nparticularly indoor air quality, will improve because of substituting \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n    ix \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nelectricity for biomass (animal dung and wood) and kerosene. \n \nBy  expanding  generation  capacity,  the  investment  program  will \nresult in more reliable power to consumers, particularly benefiting \ncommercial,  residential,  and  agricultural  customers  in  the  region, \nand  it  will  result  in  direct  positive  economic  and  social  benefits. \nPoor and vulnerable consumers (including hospitals, schools, and \nother  social  utilities)  that  are  often  hardest  hit  by  inadequate \npower  supply,  load  shedding,  and  poor  power  quality  will  benefit \ndirectly from the investment program.  \n \nThe  investment  program  will  create  new  full-time  employment \nopportunities. For civil works, the contractors expect to hire about \n100  skilled  and  500  unskilled  workers  for  a  period  of  10  years. \nIndirect  positive  impacts  of  the  project  will  result  from  economic \ngrowth  and  sales  of      power      to  the  national  grid,  allowing  local \ngovernments to generate income that can be targeted specifically \nfor social development of the province, particularly the poor. \n \nThe success of the investment program hinges on several factors. \nA detailed account of risks is given in the main body of the report. \nKey areas of concern are as follow: \n \nPolicy  Framework.  The  policy  framework  is  in  place,  but  some \nelements at the provincial level are still in draft form. A weakening \nof  policy  could  affect  the  viability  and  effectiveness  of  the \nprogram.  The  risk  is  mitigated  through  work  at  the  federal  level \nand  AEDB  (supported  by  ADB  and  other  donors)  and  the follow-\nup  to  be  given  by  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power.  The  latter \nforward.  The  provincial \nwants \ngovernments are also on board.  \n \nThe policy framework includes a new tariff regime. This is crucial \nto ensure the financial viability of the program. The connection to \nthe grid is not an issue since most operations are meant to be or \nare expected to be outside of it. But a tariff premium is required to \nback  up  some  of  the  investments.  The  regulator  has  endorsed  a \ntariff  regime  and,  given  its  independence,  this  is  unlikely  to  be \nrevoked.  Equally  important  is  the  endorsement  of  the  provincial \ngovernments.  This  is  in  place  in  some  cases,  but  with  some  RE \nresources the work has yet to be completed. \n \nThe  policy \nthe  warranties  and \nrepresentations  made  by  the  authorities.  ADB  has  the  option  to \nstop financing at any time if this agenda is changed or modified in \na  negative  manner.  The  capacity  component  provides  direct \ntechnical support in this area. In addition, ADB remains engaged \nin  the  sector  as  a  whole  through  other  transactions.  It  will  thus \nhave ample entry points for constructive dialogue with federal and \nprovincial  governments  on  policy,  technical,  tariff,  governance, \nand other issues.  \n \nCapacity  at  the  Agency  Level.  Without  professional  advice \n(national and international), the agencies responsible for \n\nthe  RE  agenda \n\nforms  part  of \n\nframework \n\nto  move \n\n \n\n\fx \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nimplementation,  new \n\nexecuting  the  program  might  be  overwhelmed  by  the  tasks  at \nhand and/or make mistakes. Areas at risk include planning, policy \nand  project  preparation, \nincentives, \nprocedures  and  systems  to  invite  the  private  sector  to  invest, \nevaluation,  and  monitoring.  There  is  also  a  problem  with  the \nquality  of  the  reporting  systems,  methodologies  used,  and  the \nnumber  and  experience  of  staff.  Financial  management  and \nfiduciary  oversight  is  also  a  concern.  These  risks  alone,  or \ncollectively,  can  impair  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  and \ndamage  the  credibility  of  the  entire  RE  policy  objective.  The \nauthorities and ADB propose to deal with these risks through the \ncapacity development component. ADB will also keep tabs on this \nand  make  changes  by  diverting  additional  finance  to  capacity \ndevelopment, if needed, under subsequent PFRs. \n \nAdherence to ADB Operating Policies and Procedures. These \nare  part  of  the  warranties  and  representations.  Noncompliance \nwith  these  can  halt  the  program\u2019s  financing  plan  and  effectively \nput  a  stop  to  new  ADB  tranches  under  the  facility.  The  risk  is \nmitigated  through  the  capacity  component  (and  action  plans \nthereof),  the  due  diligence  plan  funded  under  the  first  few \ntranches, and ADB program supervision missions.  \n \nOther. Other potential risks include (i) availability and timing of the \nprovision of counterpart funds and inadequate or slow actions on \nconsulting  services  and  procurement  contracts.  The  first  risk  is \nserious,  but  it  is  in  part  mitigated  by  the  program  fitting  closely \nwith the provincial government\u2019s budget cycle.  The risk of funding \navailability (as opposed to its timing) is more difficult to deal with. \nADB will monitor the budget process and invite submissions to the \nhigher  authorities  by  the  relevant  officials  to  ensure  that  the \ninvestment program does not falter on this account. With regard to \nconsulting and procurement, ADB will provide support for advance \nactions  and  will  assist  in  this  area  by  engaging  experts  on  the \nsubject matter. A final risk relates to backup assessments on wind \nfarm conditions. Sound data is necessary to ensure the credibility \nof future funding submissions. This work will be carried out under \nthe  program,  some  under  the  facility  and  other  under  technical \nassistance from other funding agencies, such as the United States \nAgency for International Development. \n \nThe Government requested ADB to provide a technical assistance \n(TA) package to support AEDB. This is to cater for work on policy \nformulation, better planning and program oversight or \nmanagement.  The  TA \nfits  over  and  above \ndevelopment component accompanying the MFF.  \n \nThe  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $980,000.  ADB  will  finance \n$800,000  on  a  grant  basis.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nbalance.  The  EA  for  the  TA  will  be  AEDB.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 18 months as two major tasks. The \nfirst will cover capacity development of AEDB and the second will \ncover RE policy formulation \n\nthe  capacity \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n    xi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Renewable \nEnergy  Development  Sector  Investment  Program 1  (investment  program).  The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Renewable  Energy  Policy  Formulation  and \nCapacity Development of the Alternative Energy Development Board, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nPakistan is a net importer of energy. Over the last 5 years, on average it has spent about \n$3.3  billion  annually  on  imported  energy,  equivalent  to  25%  of  the  total  import  bill.  Oil  is  the \nmain  cost  item.  During  the  current  fiscal  year  (2006)  this  cost  is  likely  to  exceed  $6  billion\u2013a \nfunction  of  both  demand  and  price  increases.  Oil  imports  place  a  heavy  burden  on  foreign \nexchange reserves. More than 65% of Pakistan\u2019s electricity comes from thermal sources, a little \nless  than  30%  from  hydro,  and  less  than  1%  from  renewable  and  other  sources.  Despite \nimports, Pakistan\u2019s power supplies are 20% less than they should be. In addition, only 55% of \nthe  population  has  access  to  electricity  from  the  national  grid.  The  remaining  45%  use \nkerosene, fuel wood, and other forms of biofuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. Pakistan has \none of the lowest per capita energy consumptions2 in the world.  \n \n3. \nPakistan\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Framework  (MTDF)  sets  out  a  strategic  vision \nand  investment  program  for  the  sector  for  the  period  2005\u20132010.  The  main  objective  of  this \nprogram  is  to  support  a  projected  6\u20138%  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Energy  is \nessential to high and inclusive growth. The poverty reduction agenda depends on it. A results \nframework is given in Appendix 1. A detailed analysis of the sector is provided in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \nThe  vision  for  the  sector  has  four  main  components:  (i)  increased  private  sector \n4. \ninvestment  in  the  entire  production  chain;  (ii)  reduced  technical,  non-technical  and  financial \nlosses;  (iii)  improved  sustainability  and  reduced  level  of  government  subsidies;  and  (iv) \nimproved  service  delivery,  efficiency,  and  governance  in  the  energy  utilities.  The  strategy  will \ndeliver  various  key  outcomes:  (i)  basic  sector  reforms  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for \nprivate sector participation; (ii) better sector analysis and stronger capacity among the relevant \nsector organizations, including in such areas as financial management, governance, operational \nefficiency,  clean  development  mechanisms,  and  project  management;  and  (iii)  promotion  of \ninfrastructure development projects in generation, distribution, and transmission, while including \nrenewable  energy    development.  The  latter  will  target  industry,  as  well  as  urban  and  rural \ncommunities. \n \nAnnual  electricity  demand  growth  is  forecast  to  average  8.3%  during  2005\u20132015.  To \n5. \ncope with this demand growth, Pakistan needs annually an additional 2,000 megawatts (MW) of \nnewly installed capacity. The estimated annual investment cost to deliver this capacity is about \n$6  billion.  This  additional  generated  power  would  need  to  be  evacuated  through  the  formal \ntransmission  network  to  consumers  through  the  distribution  system.  The  transmission  system \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Per capita electric power consumption was 290 kWh in Pakistan in 2004. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nrequires  a  major  investment  package.  The  National  Transmission  and  Dispatch  Company \n(NTDC) has developed a nationwide transmission development program for 2005\u20132012, out of \nwhich  several  priority  schemes  have  already  been  approved  by  the  Government.    ADB  will \nsupport this program. \n \n6. \nPakistan  has  considerable  potential  for  developing  a  broad  range  of  renewable  energy \n(RE) resources, principally wind, solar, biomass and small to medium-sized hydropower plants. \nRE resources can contribute to energy supply and security while helping change the mix. It also \ncan contribute to both off-grid and grid-connected power supply. RE supports rural development \nand economic activity in remote areas while yielding positive environmental and social impacts. \nPakistan has a total identified hydropower potential of more than 45,000 MW. The total installed \ncapacity  of  hydropower  generation  in  the  country  is  6,595  MW.  Hydropower  resources  are \nlocated mainly in the north, northwest, and central parts of the country. Wind and solar resource \npotential is highest in the southern provinces of Sindh and Balochistan, respectively.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges \n\n \n7. \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  (the  Government)  is  committed  to  developing  the  RE \nsector.  At  the  federal  level,  an  RE  Policy  Framework  has  already  been  developed  by  the \nAlternative  Energy  Development  Board  (AEDB).  The  latter  is  an  apex  body  charged  with \npromoting RE nationwide. The policy framework will be backed by a comprehensive action plan. \nThe  latter  includes  physical  investments,  reforms,  governance,  private  sector  engagement, \ninstitutional change, and capacity development. The RE policy fits with a broader clean energy \nand environmental policy in Pakistan.  \n \n8. \nThe genesis of the policy framework and action plans for RE development is a road map \nfor  the  sector.  This  RE  development  road  map  was  prepared  on  the  basis  of  various \nassessments undertaken over recent years, a number of  which were supported by institutions \nincluding  ADB.  The  diagnostic  work  outlined  key  problems,  challenges,  and  opportunities.  It \ncovered  each  of  the  provinces  and  subsectors.  This  work  paved  the  way  for  developing  a \nstrategic  vision  for  the  sector  and  an  investment  program.  The  latter  combines  physical  with \nnonphysical investments These are to be sequenced and complementary.  They are part of the \nsuccess factors to RE development.  A summary of key actions is given in Appendix 3 and more \ndetails  on  the  road  map  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  road  map  covers  the  period \n2006\u20132012.  At  the  provincial  level,  NWFP  and  Punjab  are  developing  new  power  generation \npolicies  that  offer  incentives  for  RE,  in  particular  with  regard  to  small  to  medium-size \nhydropower  plants.  Balochistan  and  Sindh  provinces  are  in  the  process  of  fine-tuning  their \npolicies targeting wind and solar energy. AEDB  has already received  13 proposals to develop \nthe equivalent of 180 MW of wind power in Sindh. More recently, the Government has approved \na tariff of 9.4 US cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to support wind farm investments. According to \nAEDB,  the  International  Finance  Corporation  is  considering  financial  support  for  two  of  these \nwind  power  projects.  The  remaining  11  are  to  be  presented  to  other  financiers,  including \ncommercial  banks  and  international  agencies.  The  Government  has  also  approved  4.7  US \ncents/kWh to support one private sector-sponsored hydropower plant in NWFP.  \n \n9. \nRenewable  energy  development  road  map  places  special  emphasis  on  capacity \ndevelopment.  This  covers  actions  at  various  levels.  At  the  federal  level,  there  is  a  need  for \nbetter  strategic  thinking,  planning,  and  policy  formulation,  including  incentives  and  transparent \nrules  and  procedures  for  more  private  sector  investment.  There  is  also  a  need  for  better \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n3\n\nsystems, procedures, and teams for systematic evaluations, regular monitoring, and reporting. \nThe role of institutions and their functions also needs more clarity and simplification. AEDB will \nact  as  the  first  point  of  contact  for  sector  development.  But  this  entity  requires  assistance  to \nmake it a more efficient facilitator. Its team needs training and its work plans improved. It needs \nto  introduce  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  approaches  for  operational,  technical,  financial,  and  commercial \nmatters  and  to  develop  outreach  programs,  better  information  gathering,  and  knowledge \nmanagement. The carbon credit market is also a fast evolving business opportunity. AEDB will \nneed  to  play  a  coordination  role  in  order  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  investors  and  deliver \nincome  premiums  as  a  result  of  RE  programs.  At  the  provincial  level,  RE  institutional  matters \nare  handled  by  specialized  agencies  and  their  support  units.  These  agencies  and  units  also \nrequire  technical  assistance  in  similar  areas  to  those  mentioned  for  AEDB.  In  addition,  they \nneed help with project preparation and implementation, and in particular with due diligence work \nin  technical,  commercial,  financial,  legal,  management,  governance,  financial  management, \nfiduciary  oversight,  procurement  and  safeguard  areas.  Monitoring  and  reporting  also  need \nstrengthening. The provinces are allowed to develop their own generating capacity for units up \nto  50  MW.  The  Government  wants  this  sector  to  account  for  3.5%  and  6.0%  of  total  power \ngeneration  capacity  by  2015  and  2030,  respectively.  RE  development  is  thus  compatible  with \nthe  Government\u2019s  twin  goals  of  energy  security 3  and  promotion  of  indigenous  resource \nutilization.  \n \nThe  RE  policy  emphasizes  private  sector  participation.  It  reinforces  this  by  introducing \n10. \ninvestment  incentives  and  predictability  in  the  markets.  The  RE  policy  calls  for  more  public-\nprivate  partnerships.  It  calls  for  innovative  RE  financing  mechanisms,  project  risk-sharing \narrangements  and  green  tariff  funds.  The  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  and  the \nGlobal  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  could  provide  financial  incentives  to  investors.

Table 2 shows the \nnational  power  generation  expansion  plan  for  2006\u20132030.  This  is  based  on  the  demand \nprojections given above. This plan shows that despite an expansion of RE generation by 9,700 \nMW  by  2030,  the  thermal  power  generation  capacity  (i.e.,  coal,  oil,  and  gas)  needs  to  be \nincreased  by  99,000  MW  by  2030.

As the existing transmission and grid stations network is overloaded, primary transmission \nfrom south to north and from north to south (and for the interconnection of the new generation \nprojects  to  the  national  grid)  needs  to  be  developed.  The  MTDF  also  addresses  investment \nneeds in the distribution network (e.g., overloaded grid stations and high distribution losses). An \nADB-supported technical assistance (TA) loan4 will develop a series of assistance packages to \nfacilitate transmission and distribution infrastructure improvements in the country over the short \nto  medium  term.  The  MTDF  also  addresses  nonphysical  investment  aspects  to  (i)  ensuring \nindependent regulation of the power sector; (ii) unbundling WAPDA and (iii) establish and fully \noperationalize  four  generation  companies,  nine  distribution  companies,  and  the  NTDC  as  the \nnational transmission company and executor of the single-buyer of power sector model; and (iv) \naccelerate  the  privatization  program.  In  addition,  the  MTDF  specifies  the  need  to  further \nstrengthen the National Electric Power Regulating Authority (NEPRA) as the regulator.  \n \n\n100.0% \n\n12.2% \n\n20.1% \n\n6.0% \n\n4.8% \n\n3. \n\nInvestment Plan\u2014RE Sector \n\n \n14. \nThe  RE  sector  advances  the  energy  security  agenda  by  increasing  production  from \nindigenous resources and changing the energy mix. RE also furthers the social agenda. It has \nthe potential to deliver electricity to remote and rural areas, most of which fall outside the main \ngrid.  The  total  investment  requirement  for  the  RE  subsector  is  estimated  at  $2.2  billion. \nAcceptable 5 small,  mini  and  micro  hydropower  development  will  require  investment  of  $1.1 \nbillion. This will yield about 500 MW of new generation. Investment needs for non-hydro based \nRE total $1.1 billion (to provide about 750 MW) which is expected to include solar photovoltaic \n(PV) systems, as well as wind energy, biomass and waste-based generation. \n \n4. \nProvincial Investment Plan \nThe provinces are developing their own investment programs for RE. The governments \n15. \nof NWFP and Punjab are particularly interested  in small-scale hydropower projects. The other \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2005.

Manila. \n\n5  In  Pakistan,  there  is  no  clear  definition  as  to  what  type  or  size  of  small  to  medium  hydropower  plants  could  be \n\nconsidered as RE. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n5\n\nprovinces are keener on wind, solar, and biomass. In total, 34 hydro projects totaling 7,176 MW \nhave  been  identified,  of  which  17  projects  (3,496  MW)  are  to  be  implemented  by  the  public \nsector  (Sarhad  Hydel  Development  Organization  [SHYDO]  or  WAPDA).  About  17  projects \n(3,680  MW)  will  be  sponsored  by  the  private  sector.  Total  costs  of  these  investments  run  to \n$9.33 billion (Supplementary Appendix C). The government of Punjab is the most active of the \nfour. It has identified 306 potential sites suitable for small to medium-sized hydro power stations \nin  canal  systems.  The  total  power  generation  potential  from  these  will  be  347  MW.  Among \nthese, 48 sites have a capacity potential of more than 2 MW and add up to a total capacity of \n150  MW.  These  will  require  about  $1.0  billion.  Most  of  these  projects  are  located  in  fairly \ndeveloped areas and can easily be connected to the existing grid. \n \n \n \n16. \nThe major sources of external assistance to the power sector are ADB, Japan, and the \nWorld Bank. ADB has been working actively with both the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation \nand WAPDA. The World Bank has been working mostly with WAPDA. The policy agenda in the \nsector has been a joint effort of ADB, World Bank, and the Government, with clear delineation in \nterms of tasks. ADB has provided two TAs6 in the RE sector, mainly for capacity development. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n5.  \n\n17. \nCanadian International Development Agency provided support for WAPDA to rehabilitate \nWarsak  Hydroelectric  Power  Station.  It  also  provided  assistance  to  strengthen  capacity  at  the \nMinistry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources  and  for  the  development  and  implementation  of \nsound policies and regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector investment, as well as to \nenforce effective conservation and environmental regulations. It also provided support to public \nand  private  companies  with  the  management  of  hydrocarbon  resources.  Germany  has  been \nactive  in  two  main  activities:  (i)  ongoing  support  for  a  hydropower  promotion  program  and  (ii) \nsupport  for  a  grid  station  in  Ghakkar  for  power  transmission  from  Ghazi-Barotha.  Japan  is \nconsidering  providing  assistance  for  energy  efficiency  enhancement  through  improving  the \nnational grid, load dispatch system, and area-specific electrification. \n \n18. \nThe  World  Bank  is  focused  on  ensuring  a  competitive  and  efficient  power  sector \nproviding  affordable  electric  power;  increased  access  to  electricity  in  rural  areas;  efficient  and \ncompetitive oil, gas and petroleum industries supported by effective government regulation; and \nincreased  exploration  of  mineral  resources  under  a  modernized  institutional,  legal,  and \nregulatory  framework.  It  is  assisting  with  analytical  work  to  address  governance  and  tariff \nissues,  sector  dialogue,  subsidy  policy  for  the  oil  and  gas  sectors,  and  policy  dialogue  on  the \nmineral sector. \n \n19. \nThe United Nations Development Programme recently completed a GEF-funded energy \nefficiency project and implementation of a full-scale barrier removal project for commercial wind \npower  development.  It  supports  development  of  renewable  energy  technologies  and  energy \nefficient housing through new projects for disseminating success stories in the fields of energy \nconservation  and  renewable  technology,  training  of  women  in  use  of  home  appliances,  and \npromotion of liquefied petroleum gas in the Northern Areas and in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2004.

All of these projects \nwere  classified  as  generally  successful.  Nonetheless,  the  postevaluation  findings  show \nproblems  needing  to  be  avoided  in  future.  The  most  critical  are  delays  in  implementation  and \ncost overruns. The average implementation delay was 2.4 years (with more than three quarters \nof the projects delayed by some 78% of their planned targets). Five of the projects experienced \nan  average  cost  overrun  of  82%,  and  the  other  five  an  average  underrun  of  28%.  There  are \ndifferences  between  the  various  segments  of  the  power  sector  chain.  Transmission  projects \nhave  performed  better  than  others.  ADB-financed  projects  after  1983  show  better  results. \nHowever,  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  and  WAPDA  (two  clients  since  that  time)  have \nnot delivered on operational targets, in particular regarding system loss-reductions. ADB has yet \nto finance RE projects in Pakistan.  \n \n21. \nThree  other  lessons  can  be  taken  from  ADB\u2019s  past  involvement  in  Pakistan\u2019s  power \nsector.  First,  weak  governance  influences  effectiveness  and  performance  on  the  ground.  This \nremained a concern until the authorities established NEPRA as an independent regulator. Since \nthen,  NEPRA  has  received  considerable  financial  and  technical  support  from  the  Government \nand  external  agencies  and,  on  the  whole,  it  has  been  doing  a  good  job.  Second,  the  reform \npackage did not specifically cater for private sector participation. This limited the entry of private \nfunding,  better  technology,  and  modern  management  practices.  It  also  affected  efficiency, \ncompetition, productivity, and commercial focus. Third, the funding agencies, including ADB, did \nnot  invite  civil  society  to  participate  in  a  systematic  and  active  fashion  at  the  time  of  project \nformulation.  This  may  have  discouraged  some  reforms,  accountability,  good  governance, \ncompetition, and the development of consumer advocacy groups.  \n \n22. \nThe project team has taken these lessons, along with others from other countries, into \naccount when working on the proposed investment program. The regulator continues to function \nwell, although it will be further strengthened through direct support from other agencies, namely \nthe  World  Bank.  AEDB  is  the  more  direct  counterpart  for  RE  development.  This  will  be \nsupported  directly  by  ADB  through  special  TA.  A  capacity  development  component  is \nincorporated  into  the  proposed  program,  targeting  broad  RE  sector  constraints  and  specific \nsubproject issues. Reforms revolve around tariffs, governance, and private sector involvement. \nTariff  setting  has  improved  considerably,  as  demonstrated  in  recent  hydropower  projects, \nnamely Malakand III and New Bong Escape. The tariff regime will be further fine-tuned for the \npurposes of new RE hydro projects. Tariff setting for wind farms, biomass, and solar will also be \nimproved. The latter is already happening in provinces such as Sindh where the objective has \nbeen to find a formula to entice private investment. The approved indicative (up-front) tariff for \nwind  has  been  set  at  9.4  US  cents/kWh.  Coordination  and  consultations  are  also  part  of  the \nprocess.  Starting  from  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  stage,  ADB  has  taken  a \nproactive role in promoting funding agency collaboration. USAID, German Agency for Technical \nCooperation (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit) and others are expected \nto participate with ADB  in the sector. Finally,  ADB undertook extensive consultations with civil \nsociety  during  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  A  design  and  monitoring  framework \ncaptures  the  main  outcomes  (Appendix  1).  This  framework  will  provide  a  guide  for  regular \nmonitoring of performance. It will also yield basic information to help make changes over time.  \n \n7. \n \n23. \nSince the start of ADB operations in Pakistan in 1968, total lending to the energy sector \nthere amounts to $3 billion, of which $2.4 billion was to the power subsector and $0.6 billion to \n\nADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n7\n\nthe  natural  gas  and  petroleum  subsectors.  During  recent  years,  ADB\u2019s  overall  lending  to  the \nenergy sector accounted for about 28% of total lending to Pakistan. About three quarters of the \nassistance to the power subsector ($1.58 billion in 13 loans) has been provided to WAPDA and \nthe  rest  to  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation.  ADB  has  been  the  major  source  of  external \nassistance  to  the  energy  sector,  providing  about  one  third  of  total  external  resources.  ADB\u2019s \nnonlending  activities  have  also  been  important,  totaling  $14.2  million  for  27  TA  projects \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  energy  sector  portfolio  does  not  include  any  loans  but \nconsists of seven ongoing TA projects amounting to $3.95 million. Main areas covered include \ntariff  rationalization  and  integration,  management  information  systems,  power  generation \ncoordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance,  institutional  strengthening  and  restructuring, \nand privatization. ADB has been working closely with the authorities on a road map for change, \nand based on its results ADB\u2019s indicative program in the power sector could reach $1.5 billion \nduring 2006\u20132009. \n \n24. \nThe energy sector in Pakistan needs to grow by 12% annually to sustain a GDP growth \nrate of 8%. The country direly needs to generate and evacuate more power in the coming years. \nShortages  are  already  expected  during  2006\u20132007,  the  gap  reaching  some  5,500  MW  by \n2009/10 unless new investment takes place. ADB\u2019s project pipeline in the medium term focuses \non transmission and distribution, with RE as the third pillar. Generation sector investments likely \nwill be driven by the private sector. ADB can also play a role here through individual transaction \nsupport.  The  Government  is  stepping  up  efforts  to  develop  more  indigenous  resources,  in \nparticular  those  based on  hydel.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  already  have  been  asked  to  assist \nthe  Government  and  private  sector  in  this  area.  Both  institutions  will  contribute  finance  and \nexpertise  but  also  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  ideas  on  such  key  thematic  issues  as  governance,  financial \nmanagement, procurement, anticorruption, and safeguards (environmental and social).  \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s sector strategy focuses on reform, investment and capacity. The reform agenda \ntargets  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  private  and  public  investment  alike.  It  also \ntargets development of better tariff regimes, stronger financial management systems, regulation, \ngovernance,  and  measures  to  facilitate  and  keep  private  sector  investment.  The  investment \nagenda focuses on new facilities and rehabilitation of existing ones, along the chain from supply \nthrough  transmission  and  distribution.  It  emphasizes  indigenous  resources,  with  a  focus  on \nhydropower.  That  agenda  also  attaches  priority  to  renewable  energy  development  (to  help \nchange the energy mix and increase supplies in rural areas) and energy efficiency. The capacity \nagenda  focuses  on  better  regulation  and  regulators;  more  efficient  facilitating  agencies \n(including  those  working  on  developing  public-private  partnerships);  and  improved  planning, \nevaluation,  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  fiduciary  oversight.  The  platform  for  this  strategy  is \npoverty  reduction  and  effectiveness.  It  works  on  selected  bottlenecks  to  sector  development, \nwhich, in turn, is a bottleneck to rising and inclusive growth.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA.  \n \nThe investment program in RE development will help change the energy mix but also cut \n26. \npoverty  and  improve  welfare  in  rural  areas.  It will  further  the  agenda on  clean  energy  and  the \nenvironment  while  making  use  of  indigenous  resources.  It  will  deliver  on  these  objectives  by \ncombining  physical  investments  in  new  facilities  with  reforms  and  capacity  development.  The \nprogram  will  be  phased  and  sequenced.  The  project  team  and  authorities  have  produced  a \nmatrix  matching  RE  subsectors  to  provincial,  reform,  and  subproject  readiness.  The  program \nwill  start  with  run-of-the-river  small  hydro  plants  in  Punjab  and  NWFP.  While  this  gets  off  the \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nground,  project  preparation  and  reform  and  institutional  changes  will  be  put  in  place  in \nBalochistan  and  Sindh.  These  are  provinces  better  suited  for  wind,  solar,  and  biomass \ninvestments.  The  phased  approach  does  not  overstretch  the  capacity  at  AEDB  and  on  the \nground.  It  gives  time  to  plan,  fine-tune  reforms,  and  learn  from  experiences  in  Punjab  and \nNWFP.  It  allows  ADB  teams  to  put  in  place  efficient  project  monitoring,  supervision,  and \nreporting systems, as well as procedures and mechanisms. The program\u2019s success will depend \non implementation, and that will be driven by the quality of people and systems on the ground.  \n \nB. \n \n27. \nThe investment program will contribute to economic development and well-being through \nexpanded  power  supply.  It  will  generate  1,700  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  annually,  sufficient  to \nservice about 600,000 new connections or 4.8 million people. It will improve the reliability and \nquality  of  supply.  It  will  also  increase  the  share  of  clean  and  renewable  energy  in  the  total \nenergy mix from 0.9% in 2005 to 3.5% in 2015.  \n \nThe program starts with a first batch of subprojects. These provide an accurate picture of \n28. \nwhat  will  come  on  stream  in  the  short  to  medium  term  in  two  provinces  in  that  subsector\u2014 \nhydropower\u2014 that is most ready and has high priority. This first batch has been bundled into a \nfirst periodic financing request (PFR) that will become the first loan conversion from the global \nMFF  facility.  The  subprojects  include  investments  in  small  to  medium-sized  hydropower \ndevelopment  in  NWFP  and  Punjab.  Equally  important,  it  includes  help  in  moving  project \npreparation forward  and  with  capacity  development  at  three  different  levels.  This  link  between \ninvestment and noninvestment interventions is the main feature of an MFF. It is also the basis \nfor long-term partnership and providing support services on the ground. This support is provided \nwhen  it  most  matters\u2014during  implementation  of  the  program.  It  focuses  on  outcomes, \neffectiveness, and results, rather than just on inputs or compliance. The main outputs are: \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe \nPart  A:  clean  energy  development \ndevelopment and/or expansion of small to medium-sized hydropower generation \nplants.  Three  of  these will  be  grid-connected  plants  ranging  from  2.6 MW  to  36 \nMW.  These  will  be  located  in  NWFP.  The  first  batch  will  also  include  five  small \nhydropower stations ranging from 3.2 MW to 7.2 MW in the Punjab.  \n\ninvestments.  This \n\nincludes \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nPart B: feasibility studies and due diligence for new sites. The first loan will \nfinance  the  services  of  experts  to  work  on  preparing  eight  new  hydropower \nproposals in NWFP and Punjab. This work includes detailed due diligence on all \nstandard  project  finance  areas  associated  with  ADB-financed  transactions, \nnamely  technical,  commercial,  legal,  regulatory,  operational,  management, \ngovernance,  capacity, \nfiduciary  oversight,  and \nsafeguards. The work will also include preparing advance actions on consulting \nservices, procurement, and documentation for the clearance of project concepts \nin  the  internal  government  system.  The  objective  is  to  close  the  time  gap \nbetween  the  approval  dates  for  subproject  finance  and  the  start-up  of  their \nimplementation.  One  feature  of  this  due  diligence  package  is  to  ensure  that  all \nADB operational policies and procedures are adhered to in full and at all times. \nThe  team  of  experts  also  represents  an  entry  point  at  which  ADB  program \nimplementation missions can check in advance the quality of work on the ground \nand give advice. ADB will evaluate the terms of reference of the consultants and \nprovide guidance to them and the government agencies on a regular basis. It will \nmonitor  the  past  (performance  on  the  first  PFRs)  and  any  ongoing  project \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n9\n\n \n(iii) \n\npreparatory work. The objective is to identify problem areas at an early stage and \nto  collaborate  in  defining  appropriate  solutions.  In  case  of  compliance-related \nmatters,  the  consultations  will  involve  the  relevant  teams  in  Manila  and  the \nResident Mission.  \n\nPart  C:  Capacity  Development.  This  will  support  establishment  of  new \nevaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  systems  at  the  federal,  provincial,  and \nimplementation agency levels. It will also define and execute a program to help \nimprove  strategy  and  policy  formulation  and  planning,  knowledge  management \n(regarding sector development issues and project best practice worldwide), staff \ncoaching  and  training,  financial  management  systems  and  practices,  fiduciary \noversight, accounting and auditing and financial reporting. The program will also \nwork  on  institutional  strengthening  (including  changing  the  mandates  of  some \nentities). \n\n  \nTechnical Justification and Selection Criteria \n\nC. \n \n29. \nAll  selected  subprojects  under  the  first  PFR  have  been  subjected  to  assessments \nrequired  under  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  Initially,  the  subprojects  were  checked  by  local \nand provincial agencies against technical and other criteria. The reports were then submitted to \nfederal agencies for additional reviews and approval. ADB-funded project preparatory technical \nassistance consultants worked on various aspects of the proposed subprojects. ADB processing \nmissions visited several project sites, reviewed available information and reports, and undertook \ncomprehensive  due  diligence  assessments  on  a  range  of  areas  (including  safeguards).  All \nsubprojects included in the first loan meet ADB criteria and operating policies and procedures. \nFuture  financing  submissions  under  the  MFF  facility  will  undergo  the  same  process,  although \nthe fieldwork will be undertaken by due diligence experts. The authorities provided ADB with a \nset of warranties and representations on several fronts. With regard to  the actual subprojects, \nthese warranties cover the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe proposed subprojects will involve either new construction or rehabilitation of \n(a) small to medium-sized hydropower plants with installed capacity of not more \nthan  50  MW,  preferably  run-of-the  river  schemes;  (b)  wind  turbines;  (c)  solar \ncells; (d) biomass; or (e) other forms of renewable energy sources. \nIf  grid-connected,  the  total  capacity  of  each  of  the  subprojects  will  not  be  less \nthan 2 MW.  \nFor  each  subproject,  a  feasibility  study  and  support  due  diligence  shall  have \nbeen prepared. The feasibility study and due diligence will include the following \naspects, among others: (a) technical design, including the proposed technology; \n(b)  economic  and \ntariff  requirement;  (c) \noperational  sustainability,  including  maintenance  and  availability  of  spare  parts; \n(d)  institutional  capacity  analysis;  (e)  environmental  analysis;  and  (f)  social \nassessments,  and  resettlement  plans,  following  a  proper  consultation  process. \nThe  work  will  also  include  financial  management;  governance  and  fiduciary \noversight;  as  well  as  procurement,  disbursement,  and  implementation  plans \n(including monitoring and reporting). \nEach  proposed  subproject  will  meet  ADB  safeguard  requirements.  ADB \ncompliance teams will review the proposals in advance of their being submitted \nfor financing. \nThe  subprojects  will  be  ranked  using  a  least-cost  expansion  plan  reviewed  or \nassessed by means of an optimization program such as Wien Automatic System \n\nfinancial  viability, \n\nincluding \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPlanning (WASP)-IV, selecting subproject RE generation plants that contain: (a) \nthe closest link to the national or provincial grid, (b) the high priority off-grid sites, \nand  (c)  other  eligible  ways  to  maximize  social  welfare  or  minimize  unforeseen \nrisks. \nEach subproject will have been endorsed by the implementing agency, provincial \ngovernment, and AEDB (on behalf of the Government). \nPower generation plant safety measures will be incorporated into the subproject \ndesigns as required by appropriate national and international norms and values. \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Design  of  subprojects  will  be  based  on  inputs  from  community  consultations \nconducted  in  accordance  with  the  RE  policy.  However,  the  Government  and/or \nADB  may  from  time  to  time  require  that  additional  conditions  be  fulfilled  in \nsubproject selection, as needed. \nEach  participating  provincial  government  will  (a)  have  established  a  project \nmanagement unit to implement the proposed subprojects, (b) commit to provide \nthe  required  counterpart  funding  on  time,  and  (c)  agree  to  implement  the \nsubprojects  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ADB  guidelines  on  procurement, \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  disbursements,  financial  management,  fiduciary \noversight (including anticorruption measures), and auditing requirements. \n\n \n30. \nThe  investment  program  will  also  accommodate  special  pilot  projects  that  are  directly \nlinked  to,  or  closely  associated  with,  RE  development.  For  example,  for  some  off-grid  RE \nprojects,  it  may  be  necessary  to  include  a  rural  electrification  or  community  management \ncomponent to ensure project sustainability. There are also various pilot activities that may have \npotential to be scaled up but which have never been tested to assure their sustainability.  \n \nD. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPolicy Support \n\n \n31. \nThe Government has prepared an RE policy framework for the sector. This is backed by \nprovincial  RE  policies.  Both  NWFP  and  Punjab  province  have  completed  their  drafts.  These \nderive from a renewable energy development road map that was prepared by the Government. \nThis maps out a list of problems, challenges, and opportunities while outlining a policy agenda \nfor RE development in the short to medium term (up to 2010). The Government also prepared a \nfollow-up investment program. ADB has been helping in all of these areas.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Development  \n\n \n32. \nThe investment program combines investments with work on capacity development. The \nlatter is weak (see Appendix 4 and,  for details, Supplementary Appendix E). The Government \nhas requested technical assistance support from ADB to formulate a comprehensive Renewable \nEnergy  Policy  and  capacity  development  of  AEDB.  Details  of  the  proposed  Technical \nAssistance are given in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix F. The capacity development \ncomponent focuses on addressing bottlenecks at three separate levels: \n \n33. \nFederal  Level.  The  main  target  is  to  build  AEDB\u2019s  capacity.  Major  funding  agencies, \nincluding ADB, have already provided assistance. Further assistance is expected in future. It will \nfocus  on  policy  formulation,  evaluation  systems,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  such  human \nresources  development  as  coaching  and  training.  AEDB  also  needs  up-to-date  information  on \nsector developments and best practice ideas on project and policy development.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n11\n\nProvincial  and  Implementing  Agency  Levels.  At  the  provincial  level,  there  are  also \n34. \nconstraints. The main targets for help are the irrigation and power departments (IPDs). These \nare  responsible  for  the  program  at  this  level.  The  IPDs  need  help  similar  to  that  provided  to \nAEDB,  albeit  more  focused  on  project  preparation  and  implementation,  private  sector \nparticipation modalities, evaluation systems, monitoring, and reporting. Financial management, \nfiduciary  oversight,  and  safeguards  compliance  will  be  key  support  areas.  These  institutions \nalso  need  management  support.  They  will  provide  oversight  to  the  project  implementing \nagencies.  They  will  need  coaching  and  assistance  with  policy  reformulation  and  strategic \nplanning.  Financial  accountability  will  be  another  major  concern.  Improvements  in  accounting \nand auditing while incorporating adequate financial management standards will be necessary to \nensure fiduciary oversight of disbursed funds. The implementing agencies need and will receive \ntraining  on  project  preparation  (backed  by  the  due  diligence  teams),  project  management, \nfinancial  management,  and \nprocurement,  disbursement,  operation  and  maintenance, \ncompliance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  None  of  the  agencies  have  been  exposed  to \nADB policies in the past. The capacity development component will work on these but also on \nmore routine tasks such as evaluation systems, monitoring, and reporting. This is essential. As \nthe federal and provincial governments make the warranties and representations to ADB, they \nneed information about what happens on the ground. ADB teams need the same information for \nthe purposes of reporting to the Management and the Board. Through institutional development, \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  transformed  into  commercially  oriented  entities  with  functioning \nboards  of  directors  and  appointed  Chief  Executive  Officers,  supported  by  operating  teams, \nfinance, and administration.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n \n35. \nThe Government wishes to involve the private sector in RE development. In 2002, it set \nout  the  Policy  for  Power  Generation  Projects,  which  provided  a  clear  set  of  incentives,  along \nwith a regulatory regime, to attract private capital. No new independent power producers have \nyet  become  operational,  although  several  are  under  negotiation.  The  provincial  power \ngeneration  policies  being  prepared  by  the  governments  of  NWFP  and  Punjab,  based  on  the \nPolicy for Power Generation Projects, will allow wholly owned private sector and public-private \npartnerships  as  modalities  for  project  development.  Within  ADB,  the  public  and  the  private \nsector departments will share information and collaborate on specific transactions, as needed. \n  \n\n4. \n\nLinkage with Global Environment Initiatives \n\n \nRE  development  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  local  and  global  environment. \n36. \nBesides reducing atmospheric pollution directly harmful to humans and ecosystems caused by \nthe combustion of fossil fuel for power generation, the program will also reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions  and  help  mitigate  climate  change.  Therefore,  RE  development  in  Pakistan  is \ninherently  linked  with  global  environment  initiatives,  such  as  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  which  the \nGovernment ratified in 2005. Subprojects of the investment program may qualify for the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM)  as  specified  in  the  Protocol.  Some  of  the  subprojects,  in \nparticular wind and solar options, may also qualify for assistance from the GEF. The CDM and \nGEF  are  expected  to  enhance  the  commercial  viability  of  subprojects  under  the  investment \nprogram. They will also promote private sector participation in RE development. With successful \nprivate  participation  in  RE  development,  Pakistan  could  demonstrate  such  best  practice \nexamples  in  RE  development  as  models  for  other  DMCs.  The  application  of  the  CDM  and \nsupport  from  GEF  to  the  investment  program  will  be  examined  during  its  subsequent \nprocessing. Such support could enhance the financial viability of subprojects and sustainability \nof public-private partnerships. Details are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nE.  \n \n37. \nThe investment program totals to $2.2 billion. The first batch of subprojects, including the \ncapacity development component under the investment program amounts to $145 million. Cost \nestimates  for  eight  subprojects  are  in  Appendix  5  and  the  details  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix H. The cost estimates are based on due diligence conducted by independent external \nexperts, some engaged by ADB and others by the authorities.  \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Financing Facility  \n\n \n38. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  finance  up  to  a  maximum  of  $510  million.  The  MFF  will  thus \nfinance  only  a  relatively  small  part  of  the  investment  program.  The  rest  will  be  funded  by  the \nGovernment and the private sector. ADB financing will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  and  Special Funds  resources.  This will  be  done  through  individual  loans  for  related \nbatches of subprojects. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision \nto  borrower  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n\n \n\n39. \nThe  maximum  utilization  period  under  the  MFF  will  be  for  a  10-year  period  ending  31 \nDecember  2017.  Each  specific  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  with  its \nimplementation  period.  The  closing  date  for  submitting  PFRs  under  the  MFF  will  be  31 \nDecember 2015, provided that such utilization period will lapse 12 months from the date of the \nMFF\u2019s  approval  by  the  Board,  unless  by  such time  the  first  loan  agreement  under  the  MFF  is \nsigned  and  made  effective.  The  governments  of  NWFP  and  Punjab  have  requested  ADB  to \nprovide several loans or tranches to their parts of the RE program.7  The indicative loan amounts \nfor the two provinces will be $180 million and $150 million, respectively. Balochistan and Sindh \nprovinces will absorb the balance. Other administrative territories could also request funding to \ndevelop any form of RE at any time during implementation of the MFF, subject to their meeting \nsubproject  selection  criteria  and  other  conditions  set  out  under  the  global  facility.  Each  loan \nunder  the  MFF  would  not  be  smaller  than  $50  million.  The  first  set  of  loans  amounts  to  the \nequivalent of $115 million.  \n \nADB will use its ordinary capital resources to finance $500 million under the MFF.8 The \n40. \nGovernment  has  the  option  to  choose  between  eligible  currencies  and  interest  rate  regimes \nunder  each  loan.  The  specific  terms  of  each  loan  will  be  based  on  the  related  PFR.  ADB  will \nalso  provide  a  $10  million  loan  in  Special  Drawing  Rights  under  the  MFF  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  for \nnonphysical investments, including capacity development, due diligence, and feasibility studies.9 \nThe borrower in all cases will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The proceeds of the loans will \nbe  made  available  by  the  borrower  to  the  provinces  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as \napplicable to the borrower. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the borrower. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Tranche and set of loans are used interchangeably. \n8  All of the provisions of ADB. 2001. Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations Applicable to LIBOR-Based Loans Made \nfrom ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources. (1 July) will apply to each loan, subject to modifications, if any, that may \nbe included under any related loan agreement. \n\n9  All of the provisions of ADB. 2006.Special Operations Loan Regulations. Manila (1 January) will apply to each loan , \n\nsubject to modifications, if any, that may be included under any related loan agreement. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n13\n\n2. \n\nTechnical and Geographical Coverage \n\n \n41. \nThe  first  loan  will  cover  NWFP  and  Punjab  and  be  used  for  investment  in  small  hydro \nplants. Other provinces and geographical areas will require and request finance later. Pakistan \nhas  a  significant  potential  for  a  wide  range  of  RE  resources.  These  include  small  to  medium-\nsized  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  waste-to-energy,  and  biomass  resources.  Hydropower  is \neconomically viable and is in the long-term a well-proven option for the power sector. Feasibility \nstudies  are  available  for  many  potential  sites  in  NWFP,  Punjab  and  Sindh  provinces. \nFurthermore,  public  as  well  as  private  investors  are  interested  in  developing  new  sites.  The \neconomic  viability  of  wind  power  can  be  resolved  with  enhanced  wind  mapping  and  prior \nassessment  studies.  Solar  data  could  be  taken  from  international  data  banks  and  correlated \nwith  Pakistan  Meteorological  Department  data.  Larger-scale  PV  systems  are  also  not  a  priori \nfinancially attractive under the current legal and regulatory frameworks. But PV systems can be \nviable  for  decentralized  supplies  to  remote  villages  where  no  other  supply  option  exists  and \nwhere capacities are limited to basic electrification. This resource can also be enhanced through \ninnovative pricing and financing for grid-connected households. \n  \n\n3. \n\nCost Estimates \n \n\n42. \n\nCost estimates for the financing facility are given below: \n\n \nTable 3: Cost Estimates for the Financing Investment Program \n($ million) \n\nItem \nClean Energy Development  \nFeasibility Studies and Due Diligence \nCapacity Development  \nContingencies \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n2,100 \n30 \n25 \n45 \n2,200 \n\n \n \n\n  Note: 2006 prices. \n  Sources: Alternative Energy Development Board and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n43. \nThe  investment  cost  of  eight  subprojects  in  NWFP  and  Punjab  and  the  capacity \ndevelopment  component  amounts  to  the  equivalent  of  $145.0  million  ($80.0  for  NWFP  and \n$65.0 million for Punjab). The Government has requested ADB to finance up to 80% of the total \ncost.

The subprojects \nunder  the  first  PFR  will  cover  two  provinces,  NWFP  and  Punjab.  Accordingly,  those \ngovernments\u2019 IPDs will be the EAs at the provincial level. The IAs will be SHYDO in the case of \nNWFP  and,  until  such  time  that  the  proposed  autonomous  corporate  body  (Punjab  Power \nDevelopment  Company  Limited)  is  established  and  fully  functioning,  Punjab  IPD  will  fulfill  that \nrole in Punjab. The subproject implementation structure is given in Appendix 7.  \n \n45. \nSHYDO has established one project management unit (PMU), which is at its main office \nin Peshawar. The PMU will cover three main functions: (i) construction of the three hydropower \nplants; (ii) undertaking feasibility studies, due diligence work, and capacity development; and (iii) \nconstruction  of  a  new  office  base.  The  PMU  director  and  field-level  project  managers  have \nalready been appointed. They will report all subproject-related matters to the Director, Planning \nand Facilitation of SHYDO, who is ex-officio the overall coordinator for the NWFP loan.  \n \n46. \nA PMU has been established in Punjab IPD, headed by a project director. Several key \nstaff members have been assigned to carry out preparatory work on existing and future projects, \nincluding  preparing  and  submitting  Project  Concept-1s  for  approval.  They  will  also  work  on \nobtaining  approval  for  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and  resettlement  plans  by  the \nprovincial  government,  and  undertaking  advance  actions  in  recruiting  consultants  and  in \nprocurement.  At  the  same  time,  Punjab  IPD  has  taken  steps  to  establish  a  company,  to  be \nwholly owned by the provincial government, to manage the construction, as well as to own and \noperate the hydropower plants. A draft charter of the company, the Punjab Power Development \nCompany Limited, has been prepared. The provincial government has endorsed the plan and it \nis expected that the company will be legally established, fully staffed, and functioning before 31 \nDecember 2006. Once the company is operational, the tasks of the PMU will be taken over by \nthe company and therefore the company will become the IA.  \n\n \n2. \n\nInvestment Program Management \n\nThe \n\ninvestment  program  was  processed \n\n \nimplementation \n47. \nprocedures,  and  staff  guidelines  were  followed  for  processing  the  MFF.  The  first  set  of \nsubprojects  has  been  appraised  by  the  ADB  project  team,  the  authorities,  and  external \nconsultants. The EAs and IAs will appraise the new round of subprojects. They will be assisted \nby due diligence teams and ADB. The IAs will be responsible for processing and implementing \nthe  subprojects.  The  due  diligence  teams  will  work  on  all  technical  matters,  and  undertake \npreliminary  design  work  before  carrying  out  assessments  related  to  safeguards,  governance, \n\nfollowing  sector \n\nloan \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n15\n\nreports \n\nsocial  and  commercial  issues,  procurement,  fiduciary  oversight,  reporting  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  work  will  comprise  environmental  assessment \n(including \nenvironmental management plans [EMPs] with budgets), resettlement and indigenous peoples \ndevelopment  plans,  and  specific  design  proposals  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  and \nGovernment requirements. Summary appraisal reports will be submitted to ADB subsequent to \napproval from the relevant EAs and required internal Government clearances. Prior to this, ADB \nsupervision teams will engage with the authorities while the work is being carried out to provide \nguidance and advice. Compliance-related work will be reviewed by ADB compliance teams. The \nIAs will prepare progress reports and submit them to their internal agencies and then to ADB on \na quarterly basis. These reports will focus on individual loans, but they will address at the same \ntime  the  overall  investment  program  (performance  in  relation  to  targets)  and  each  of  the \nwarranties and representations made to ADB under the framework financing agreement (FFA). \nThe  capacity  development  component  includes  a  monitoring  and  reporting  system.  This  is \nnecessary  to  ensure  the  Government  and  ADB  work  based  on  the  same  information  and \nmethodologies. The design and monitoring framework will be a key reference document in this \ncontext.  All  relevant  frameworks,  such  as  the  Environmental  Assessment  Framework  (EAF), \nResettlement Framework, and Indigenous People\u2019s Development Plan, relevant to the MFF and \nthe  first  batch  of  subprojects  have  been  prepared,  reviewed  by  ADB,  and  approved  by  the \nGovernment. These are attachments to the FFA. \n \nOverall progress and compliance with conditions under the FFA and individual loans and \n48. \nproject agreements will be monitored on a regular basis by the authorities and their agencies, \nwith  periodic  reports  to  ADB.  These  reports  will  be  structured \ninvestment  and \nnoninvestment areas and will be consistent with existing project implementation requirements. A \nreporting format will be prepared by ADB. The reports will include evaluations of key issues and \nproblems  faced  by  the  EAs  and  recommended  remedial  actions.  ADB  management  and  staff \nwill report regularly to the Board on implementation of the program and individual loans. Board \ninformation reports will be submitted on an annual basis or, if necessary, more frequently. Each \nproject under the MFF is expected to have an implementation period of five years. ADB has also \nhelped  the  Government  to  develop  a  dedicated  website  for  the  investment  program \n(http://www.adb-pakistanrenewableenergy.com/). This is linked to the websites of the EAs and \nIAs, and the general site of ADB. \n \n\ninto \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n \n49. \nEquipment and materials to be financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines10as amended from time to time. International competitive bidding (ICB) will \nbe  used  for  turnkey  contracts  targeting  the  construction  of  hydropower  plants  and  supply \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  $1  million  or  more.  Limited  international  bidding  will  be  used  for \nsupply contracts estimated at $100,000 to $1 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) will be \nused for contracts estimated to cost less than $100,000. Civil works contracts estimated at less \nthan  $1.5  million  also  will  be  procured  following  NCB  procedures.  Before  commencement  of \nNCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  Government\u2019s  procurement \nprocedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications  to  the  Government\u2019s  procedures  will  be  documented  in  the  procurement  plan. \nContract packages will be prepared and structured to ensure maximum competition under ICB. \nSimilar  contractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to  other  subprojects. \nIndicative procurement packages for the appraised subprojects are presented in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006. Procurement Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nConsulting services will be required for (i) design, supervision, and management under \n50. \nPart A; (ii) feasibility studies and due diligence work under Part B; and (iii) capacity development \nunder Part C. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB guidelines,11as \namended from time to time.  Consulting firms will be chosen by international competition, using \nthe quality and cost-based selection method. Individual experts may also be recruited based on \nbiodata submitted in response to specific terms of reference for assignments in accordance with \nADB\u2019s procedures for recruitment of individual consultants. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Disbursement Arrangements \n\n \n51. \nThe  proceeds  of  individual  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  its  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations, \nLIBOR-Based Loan Products, both as amended from time to time. To expedite implementation, \nthe Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval to carry out advance actions for the recruitment \nof  consultants.  The  Government  and  the  EAs  have  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance \nactions does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy12, was explained to and discussed with the Government, the \n52. \nEAs,  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the subprojects under the MFF. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  first  tranche  loans.  In  the  future  also,  similar \nprovisions will be required for each loan under the MFF. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB  in  connection  with  the  subprojects  will  include  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EAs, IAs, and contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand  other  service  providers,  as  these  relate  to  the  subprojects  or  projects  under  the  overall \ninvestment program and MFF.  \n \n53. \nADB  promotes  transparency,  participation,  accountability,  and  zero  tolerance  for  any \ncorruption  associated  with  its  financial  and  technical  assistance  to  the  RE  sector.  To  ensure \nsuch  transparency  and  good  governance,  ADB  and  the  authorities  have  agreed  that  each  EA \nwill  publicly  disclose  via  a  website  all  relevant  information  as  to  how  and  when  the  funds  are \nbeing used. The website will include contract bids and awards, as well as financial statements. \nAmong other things, it will track procurement contract awards and operating expenditures, and \ninclude  information  relating  to  lists  of  participating  bidders,  names  of  winning  bidders,  basic \ndetails on bidding procedures adopted, contract amounts awarded, lists of goods and services \npurchased,  and  the  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  those  goods  and  services.  Moreover, \nnational  and  provincial  newspapers  will  publicize  such  details  at  least  semiannually  in  Urdu, \nPushto  and  English.  Television  and  radio  broadcasts  will  be  made  in  these  languages  at \nnational  and  provincial  levels,  as  appropriate,  to  provide  the  same  details.  A  monitoring  and \nreporting system will be established to back up this disclosure policy. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005.

These will be submitted to the authorities and ADB. The reports \nwill  include  descriptions  of  physical  progress,  problems  and  difficulties  encountered,  and  a \nsummary of financial accounts that will consist of loan expenditures during  the  period,  year  to \ndate, and total to date. A project completion report will be submitted within 3 months following \ncompletion  of  each  project  and  of  each  subproject.  SHYDO  and  Punjab  IPD  will  maintain \nseparate accounts for each loan. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, SHYDO and \nPunjab IPD  will submit annual pro forma project accounts and unaudited financial statements. \nAudited project accounts and financial statements will be provided within 6 months of the close \nof  the  financial  year.  SHYDO  and  Punjab  IPD  will  hire  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to \nADB to conduct these audits. \n \nG. \n \nThe IAs will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit these to ADB within 45 days \n55. \nof  the  end  of  each  quarter.  Such  report  will  provide  (i)  narrative  description  of  progress  made \nduring  the  period  on  the  parts  of  the  program  and  loan  relating  to  them,  (ii)  changes  in  the \nimplementation  schedule,  if  any,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  and  (iv)  work  to  be \ncarried out over the next 6-month period. Progress reports will also include summary financial \naccounts for the loans, including expenditures during the period, and total spending to date. The \nreports will also cover those variables included in the design and monitoring framework. This is \nto ensure that the authorities and ADB monitor results rather than just inputs and outputs. The \nADB project teams will prepare periodic reports to inform Management and the Board of overall \nprogress.  A  Board  information  report  will  be  submitted  annually  and  be  complemented  with \nprogress reports prior to management approval of individual loan agreements. \n \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  first  loan  approval.  ADB  will \n56. \nthen  review  the  implementation  and  operations  based  on quarterly  progress  reports  and  meet \nwith the Government, EAs, and IAs at least semiannually to discuss implementation progress. \nThe  ADB  teams  will  engage  on  a  regular  basis  with  due  diligence  and  capacity  development \nconsultants to provide guidance and advice, but also to anticipate and deal with issues on the \nground. A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after the loan effectiveness. This will focus \non  the  policy,  capacity, engineering,  social,  resettlement,  environmental,  governance,  financial \nmanagement,  and  implementation  progress  areas.  Representatives  of  ADB,  EAs,  and  IAs  will \ntake part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure \nsuccessful  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted  within  3  months  following  completion  of  the  individual  projects.  An  MFF  completion \nreport  will  be  prepared  after  ADB-supported  activities  and  projects  under  the  MFF  will  be \ncompleted. \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nFinancial Management \n\nA. \n \n57. \nFinancial management assessments of each IA were undertaken to assess its ability to \nundertake  and  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  project  components.  The  work  was \nbased  on  due  diligence  using  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires  and  field \ninterviews.  The  financial  management  base  for  the  IAs  was  found  to  be  acceptable \n(Supplementary Appendix I). Any potential fiduciary risks will be minimized through adopting an \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nFinancial Sustainability  \n\naccounting  and  financial  management  manual13 for  Pakistan  developed  in  collaboration  with \nADB. The monitoring and results systems will further strengthen this aspect. Financial analysis \nresults are provided in Appendix 9 and details are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nB. \n \n58. \nPro forma financial statements were prepared for each IA. SHYDO will be financially and \noperationally independent from NWFP\u2019s provincial government and Punjab Power Development \nCompany  Limited  will  be  incorporated  and  operate  independently  from  the  Punjab  provincial \ngovernment.  ADB  will  monitor  and  ensure  that  this  is  the  case  (Appendix  10).  Pro  forma \nfinancial statements were prepared for the agencies. These include balance sheet entries, profit \nand  loss  accounts,  cash  flow  statements  and  operating  and  financial  ratios  (all  prepared  in \nnominal  terms).  Two  IAs  are  expected  to  be  financially  sound  from  FY2009  onwards.  More \ndetails are available in Supplementary Appendix K. This financial approach and set of controls \nwill  be  adopted  also  in  the  cases  of  new  agencies  established  in  the  other  provinces  for  the \npurposes of the program. Central and West Asia Department is recruiting financial modeling and \naccounting  experts  to  assist  not  only  with  project  processing  but  also  with  project  financial \nmonitoring  and  controls.  These  experts  will  be  part  of  the  review  missions  fielded  by  the \ndepartment. The Resident Mission will also play a key role in the supervision process.  \n \nA financial evaluation was completed for Part A of the project loan using constant 2006 \n59. \nprices.  The  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  were  converted  into  real  terms  by \nadjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations. \nIncremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of the IAs under \na  with-  and  without-project  scenario.  The  average  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR), \ncomputed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  8.8%  for  three  NWFP  projects  and  8.1%  for  five  Punjab \nprojects.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  average  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also \ncomputed on an after-tax basis of 4.4%. The projects are considered both financially viable and \nsustainable. Cost recovery is expected to be sound. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the FIRR \nfor each subproject under the first tranche or first loan is robust and can withstand both tighter \nprice variables and higher investment and operating cost scenarios.  \n   \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n60. \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  first  eight  subprojects  to  be  financed  under \nthe first loan. Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were calculated by comparing with- and \nwithout-project scenarios for each subproject. Economic benefits accrue to consumers and the \neconomy.  Incremental  consumption  occurs  due  to  the  extended  availability  of  lower-cost  and \ncleaner  grid-sourced  electricity.  This  was  valued  using  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  this \nincremental  consumption.  Non  incremental  consumption  occurs  as  consumers  replace  other \nforms of energy with electricity from the project (the resource cost saving). This was valued on \nthe  basis  of  the  estimated  long-run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  of  electrical  energy  delivery  to \nconsumers (Appendix 11).  \n \nEstimates  indicate  that  the  three  proposed  hydropower  plants  in  NWFP  have  EIRRs \n61. \nranging  from  15.0%  to  21.7%,  and  that  the  five  proposed  hydropower  plants  in  Punjab  have \nEIRRs  ranging  from  17.2%  to  20.7%.  These  EIRRs  indicate  that  the  plants  are  economically \n\n                                                 \n13 The Accounting and Financial Management Manual for Development Project in Pakistan was developed as part of \nADB. 2003.

It will be adopted by IAs. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n19\n\nEnvironment Assessment \n\nsound and viable. The EIRRs are considered as minimum estimates. No attempt was made to \nquantify the positive net environmental impacts expected to accrue from the investments. Local \nbenefits would also accrue as the subprojects would significantly improve quality and reliability \nof supply: voltage would be higher, resulting in brighter lighting and less equipment failure and \ndamage.    Moreover,  there  would  be  less  load  shedding  during  peak  demand  periods.  Details \nare in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nD. \n \n62. \nEnvironment assessment for subprojects to be included in the investment program has \nbeen conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s environment policy and guidelines,14 as well as with \nthe Government\u2019s environmental assessment regulations and guidelines. The eight subprojects \nunder the first PFR are assigned Category B. For each subproject an IEE report and EMP with a \ncorresponding  implementation  budget  have  been  prepared  (Appendix  12).  An  Environmental \nAssessment Framework (EAF) has been prepared according to ADB requirements and agreed \nwith the Government.  More details are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n63. \nSubproject  components  have  been  redesigned,  wherever  necessary,  to  minimize \npossible  adverse  environmental  impacts.  To  mitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  at  the \nconstruction  stage,  detailed  environmental  management  plans  have  been  prepared  and \nattached with the IEEs. A tree plantation program has been included under the investment plan \nfor the subprojects. The risk of reduced water in the waterway in two of the subprojects has the \npotential  to  affect  the  water  use  of  some  segments  of  the  population  on  the  affected  stretch, \nparticularly  during  winter  months  when  the  rivers  have  much  reduced  natural  flows.  Adequate \nminimum  water  flow  standards  will  be  put  in  place  to  guarantee  that  the  waterways  meet \nexisting  and  future  needs.  No  component  of  any  of  the  subprojects  falls  within  an \nenvironmentally sensitive or protected area. \n \nSHYDO  and  Punjab  IPD  are  called  upon  to  strengthen  their  capabilities  to  implement \n64. \nand  monitor  all  measures  under  the  EMP.  The  specific  activities  required  for  capacity \ndevelopment are included in Part C. This support will continue through the life of the investment \nprogram.  This  capacity  action  plan  has  been  designed  into  each  of  the  subproject  loans.  The \nIAs  will  be  required  to  set  up  an  environmental  monitoring  unit,  to  appoint  environmental  and \nresettlement specialists, and to hire an independent monitor. \n \nE. \n \n65. \nA resettlement framework and indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) were \nprepared (Supplementary Appendix N and Supplementary Appendix O). These will serve as the \nbasis for preparing subsequent resettlement plans (RPs) and indigenous peoples development \nplans  for  additional  subprojects,  as  required  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous people.15 All plans will be prepared in full consultation \nwith the affected persons and will be disclosed to them prior to contract awarding. The summary \nresettlement  plan  for  Ranolia  hydropower  plant  as  a  model  case  is  in  Appendix  12. \nResettlement  plans  and  summaries  of  them  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  P.  As  EA  at  the \nfederal  level,  AEDB  has  agreed  to  be  the  \u201cowner\u201d  of  both  frameworks.  All  provinces  and  their \nRE  agencies  will  follow  these  policies  and  procedures.  Both  frameworks  are  part  of  the  FFA, \n\nSocial Assessment \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2002  Environment  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nand the endorsement by EAs will be considered a prerequisite to apply for and receive financing \nunder  the  facility.  The  resettlement  framework  and  IPDF,  along  with  the  RPs  for  the  first \ntranche,  have  already  been  disclosed  to  all  affected  persons  under  the  first  tranche  and  are \navailable on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \n66. \nExtensive  field  appraisal,  survey,  and  community  consultations  were  undertaken  on \neight  subprojects  under  the  first  PFR.  This  work  was  part  of  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  and  ADB  due  diligence  missions.  Details  on  the  stakeholder  consultation  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  Q.  Particular  attention  was  given  to  traditional  decision-making \nmechanisms. Social and poverty impacts were assessed. Six out of eight proposed hydropower \nsubprojects  (Daral  Khwar,  Ranolia  Khwar,  Machai  Canal,  Chiannawaii,  Pakpattan  Canal,  and \nOkara)  have  resettlement  impacts  while  Deg  Fall,  Sheikhupura  and  Marala  have  no \nresettlement  impacts.  Compensation  packages  and  short  RPs  have  been  prepared  for  the \nsubproject components. The same arrangements will be followed in future with this RE resource \nand others in both these and the other two provinces. \n  \nFollowing the consultations, changes were introduced to the design to minimize adverse \n67. \nimpacts on affected persons. Due to this process, resettlement impacts are limited as measured \nby  the  number  of  affected  persons  and  are  insignificant  according  to  ADB  criteria.  The \nsubprojects were also designed to avoid negative impacts on downstream villages. A minimum \nflow will be guaranteed throughout the year, and especially during winter months. SHYDO has \nalso  agreed  to  provide  a  power  distribution  transformer  to  facilitate  affected  communities\u2019 \nconnection to the grid. Out-take canals have been moved upstream so that irrigation via canals \nalso will not be affected. No additional land acquisition will be necessary because the out-take \ncanals will be laid within the existing right-of-way. \n \n68. \nThe RPs, resettlement framework and IPDF were disclosed to all affected persons. After \nProject Concepts-1 (a government planning formality) is approved, the EAs will inform the land \nacquisition collector, who will establish the notification cutoff date and will meet with all parties \nconcerned  to  establish  replacement  costs.  Given  the  limited  number  of  affected  persons,  this \nprocedure  will  ensure  greater  transparency  and  equitability.  Under  Part  C  of  the  first  loan, \nSHYDO and IPD  will develop their internal capacities for social and environmental issues and \nsafeguard  requirements  in  order  to  carry  out  the  day-to-day  activities.  Under  the  Capacity \nDevelopment  component,  they  will  also  acquire  social  and  environmental  skills  to  develop  the \nfeasibility studies for subprojects under future tranches.  \n \nF. \n \n69. \nLocal  distribution  companies  will  be  encouraged  to  undertake  village  electrification \nprograms  in  some  of  the  proposed  project  areas,  reaching  remote  and  marginalized  villages. \nThe  investment  program  will  provide  power  to  the  grid  to  supply  demand.  This  will  benefit \naffected communities. In fact, the greatest part of the newly generated hydropower is expected \nto  be  delivered  to  the  11-kilovolt  (kV)  lines  network,  while  solar  and  wind  are  likely  to  be \ncommunity-based  projects  and  therefore  directly  used  at  source.  Greater  access  to  reliable \nelectricity  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  In  fact,  reliable  electricity  supply  is  a  key  to \nsupport  community  services  such  as  education,  healthcare,  and  water  supply.  Access  to \nelectricity  will  improve  living  conditions  in  rural  areas.  Jobs  will  also  be  created,  and,  with  this \ngreater  income,  opportunities.  The  program  is  also  sound  on  gender  grounds.  A  summary  of \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Supplementary Appendix R. \n \n\nPoverty Assessment \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n21\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries under the MFF \n\nBusinesses, as well as farmers, are also expected to see productivity increases because \n70. \nof the program. Moreover, once households and business have electricity, demand for electric \ninstallations  and  appliances  will  increase.  This  will  create  additional  job  opportunities  and \ntrades. In addition, electricity supply improves the quality of life, especially for women, who are \ntraditionally responsible for activities inside the house, as well as for fuel collection. Finally, the \nprogram  will  bring  direct  benefits  to  local  communities  through  upgrading  local  roads  required \nfor use during project construction.  \n \nG. \n \n71. \nThe  program  is  designed  to  benefit  all  grid-connected  consumers  of  electricity  by \nexpanding  electric  power  supplies, enabling  the  Government  to  meet  its  objective of  universal \nelectrification under the so-called the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s Rural Electrification Program.\u201d Electricity \nfrom small to medium-sized hydropower plants under the investment program will go directly to \nthe local grids (at 11 kV or 132 kV), contributing to this key policy objective and helping to fulfill \nprovincial  demand  for  greater  energy  resources.  The  overall  objective  of  expanding  clean \nenergy generation will contribute to local, regional, and global environmental initiatives. Local air \nquality,  and  particularly  indoor  air  quality,  will  improve  by  the  substitution  of  electricity  for \nbiomass  (animal  dung  and  wood)  and  kerosene.  By  expanding  generation  capacity,  the \nProgram  is  expected  to  result  in  more  reliable  power  to  consumers  (particularly  benefiting \ncommercial,  residential,  and  agriculture  customers  in  the  region)  and  it  will  result  in  direct \npositive  economic  and  social  benefits.  Poor  and  vulnerable  consumers  (including  hospitals, \nschools,  and  other  social  utilities)  that  are  often  hardest  hit  by  inadequate  power  supply,  load \nshedding,  and  poor  power  quality,  will  benefit  directly  from  the  investment  program.  The \nProgram  is  expected  to  create  new  full-time  employment  opportunities.  For  civil  works,  the \ncontractors expect to hire about 100 skilled and 500 unskilled workers for a period of 10 years.  \n \nH. \n \n72. \nThere  are  four  key  broad  risk  areas  for  the  investment  program  and  they  are  (i)  policy \nframework, (ii) capacity at the agency level (iii) adherence to ADB policies and procedures, and \n(iv)  others.  The  first,  namely  the  policy  framework  is  in  place,  but  some  elements  at  the \nprovincial level need to be improved. The risk is mitigated through work at the federal level and \nAEDB  (supported  by  ADB  and  other  donors)  and  the  follow-up  to  be  given  by  the  Ministry  of \nWater and Power. The policy framework includes a new tariff regime. This is crucial to ensure \nthe  financial  viability  of  the  program.  The  connection  to  the  grid  is  not  an  issue  since  most \noperations are meant to be or are expected to be outside of it. But a tariff premium is required to \nback  up  some  of  the  investments.  The  regulator  has  endorsed  a  tariff  regime  and,  given  its \nindependence,  this  is  unlikely  to  be  revoked.  Equally  important  is  the  endorsement  of  the \nprovincial governments. This is in place in some cases, but with some RE resources the work \nhas yet to be completed. The policy framework forms part of the warranties and representations \nmade  by  the  authorities.  ADB  has  the  option  to  stop  financing  at  any  time  if  this  agenda  is \nchanged  or  modified  in  a  negative  manner.  The  capacity  component  provides  direct  technical \nsupport in this area. In addition, ADB remains engaged in the sector as a whole through other \ntransactions.  It  will  thus  have  ample  entry  points  for  constructive  dialogue  with  federal  and \nprovincial governments on policy, technical, tariff, governance, and other issues.  \n \n73. \nThe  second  area  covers  the  capacity  at  the  agency  level.  Without  professional  advice \n(national  and  international),  the  agencies  responsible  for  executing  the  program  might  be \noverwhelmed by the tasks at hand and/or make mistakes. Areas at risk include planning, policy \nand project preparation, implementation, new incentives, procedures and systems to invite the \n\nPotential Risks \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nprivate sector to invest, evaluation, and monitoring. There is also a problem with the quality of \nthe reporting systems, methodologies used, and the number and experience of staff. Financial \nmanagement and fiduciary oversight is also a concern. The authorities and ADB propose to deal \nwith these risks through the capacity development component. ADB will also make changes by \ndiverting additional finance to capacity development, if needed, under subsequent PFRs. \n \n74. \nAdherence to ADB operating policies and procedures is the third area. These are part of \nthe warranties and representations. Noncompliance with these can halt the program\u2019s financing \nplan  and  effectively  put  a  stop  to  new  ADB  tranches  under  the  facility.  The  risk  is  mitigated \nthrough the capacity component (and action plans thereof), the due diligence plan funded under \nthe first few tranches, and ADB program supervision missions. The final or other risks include (i) \navailability and timing of the provision of counterpart funds and inadequate or slow actions on \nconsulting services and procurement contracts. The risk of availability of counterpart funds is in \npart mitigated by the program fitting closely with the provincial government\u2019s budget cycle.  The \nrisk  of  funding  availability  (as  opposed  to  its  timing)  is  more  difficult  to  deal  with.  ADB  will \nmonitor  the  budget  process  and  invite  submissions  to  the  higher  authorities  by  the  relevant \nofficials  to  ensure  that  the  investment  program  does  not  falter  on  this  account.  With  regard  to \nconsulting and procurement, ADB will provide support for advance actions and will assist in this \narea by engaging experts on the subject matter.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n75. \nSpecific Assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the \nprovincial governments (NWFP and Punjab at the outset) have given the following assurances, \nwhich have largely been incorporated in the attached FFA, and that will be incorporated in the \nindividual loan and project agreements, as applicable for each project under the MFF, subject to \nany amendment to be mutually agreed by the Government and ADB. \n \nCounterpart Funding. The Government will ensure, and cause each EA to ensure, the \n76. \navailability  and  timely  release  of  counterpart  funding  for  the  timely  implementation  of \nsubprojects.  For  this  purpose,  the  Government  will  cause  the  provinces  to  ensure  that  (i)  the \nannual development program incorporates revised estimates of the funding requirements for the \nrelated subprojects under the Facility, and (ii) the funds are released to the assigned accounts.  \n \n77. \nLand  Availability  and  Resettlement.  The  provinces  will  cause  each  IA  to,  subject  to \ncompliance with the relevant provision of the resettlement framework/RPs and EAF/EMP and in \naccordance with all applicable laws and regulations of Pakistan/respective province, acquire or \nmake available the land and rights to land free from any encumbrances, and clear utilities, trees, \nand any other obstruction from such land, required for commencement of construction activities \nin accordance with  the schedule agreed under the related civil works contract. \n \n78. \nThe  provinces  will  cause  respective  IAs,  to  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way \nrequired by the subprojects will be made available in a timely manner and that the provisions of \nthe  short  RPs,  including  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  persons,  will  be \nimplemented in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations of the Government, including \nas  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  the  entitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  Government\u2019s \napplicable  laws,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  agreed \nresettlement framework. \n \n79. \nEnvironment.  The  Government  and  the  provinces  will  ensure  that  environmental \nassessments of the subprojects are conducted according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n23\n\nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws,  and  the  EAF.  The  Government  and  the  provinces  will \nalso  ensure  that  (i)  the  future  subprojects  will  not  be  located  within  national  parks and  wildlife \nsanctuaries, (ii) monuments of cultural or historical importance will be avoided, (iii) an EMP with \nadequate  budget  will  be  developed  for  each  subproject,  and  (iv)  Environment  Category  A \nsubprojects will not be included in the Project.  \n \n80. \nSocial Impacts and Other Issues. In case of any significant or related impacts on tribal \npeople  under  any  subproject,  these  will  follow  the  requirements  as  set  forth  in  the  IPDF  as \nagreed  by  ADB,  including  special  provisions  for  all  TP  households  to  ensure  that  their  living \nstandards are not adversely affected as a result of land donation or in the event of any loss of \nnon-land asset and impacts on their livelihoods. As also laid down in the IPDF, for any impact \non  land  involving  traditional  and  burial  rights  of  the  TPs,  the  legal  provision  laid  down  by  the \nGovernment and the provinces pertaining to transfer of land will be duly followed. \n \n81. \nThe  provinces  will  ensure  acceptance  of  subprojects  through  effective  community \nparticipation  in  selecting  and  implementing  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies and the RE policy, as supplemented by the resettlement framework and EAF. \n \n82. \nSubproject Selection Criteria.

It  is  endowed  with  about  42,000  Megawatt  (MW) \nhydropower  potential,  most  of  which  is  located  in  North  West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP), \nNorthern Areas, Azad Jammu and  Kashmir (AJK), and Punjab. The total installed capacity for \nhydropower stations is about 6,594 MW, of which 3,767 MW is in NWFP, 1,698 MW in Punjab, \n1,036 MW in AJK, and 93 MW in the Northern areas.  \n \nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reports some wind data but their quality \n2. \nand reliability need to be improved in order to judge the financial and economic viability of the \nproposed investments accurately. It has been argued that the wind speeds are far higher than \nthe  data imply.  Recently,  two  additional  wind stations  (50m  high)  have been  built  in  the  Pasni \narea  of  Balochistan  province  as  part  of  a  project  funded  by  the  Global  Environment  Facility \n(GEF). The measurements from these stations indicate a long-term annual mean wind speed of \n5.5  meters  per  second  (m/s).  Existing  data  indicate  good  wind  conditions  in  a  wind  corridor \nextending  from  Gharo  to  Keti-Bandar,  south-east  of  Karachi  in  southern  Sindh.  Wind \nmeasurements have been undertaken by PMD  during 2002-2005 and may have been verified \nby potential private investors who installed their own masts. An average mean wind speed of 7 \nm/s  or  better  has  been  identified  at  50  m  height.  Under  such  conditions,  economically  viable \nwind farms can be established provided policy and tariff conditions are adequate.   \n \n3. \nWhile  some  solar  data  are  available  from  meteorological  departments,  it  is  not  known \nwhether  there  has  been  a  review  of  the  equipment,  accuracy  of  data,  or  standards  adopted. \nNevertheless,  data  for  a  number  of  stations  have  been  compiled  and  they  are  available  in \ninternational  data  banks.  Taking  that  data  into  consideration,  sun  radiation  and  daily  sunshine \nhours  are  described  as  being  good  to  excellent  in  Balochistan  and  in  some  areas  of  Sindh \nprovinces.  Photovoltaic  (PV)  power  is  currently  solely  used  for  single  house  supply  and \ndecentralized village supply schemes. About 40 villages were supplied with centralized systems \nsome years ago, but most of these are now out of order because of the poor equipment supply, \nand  thus  villagers  are  dissatisfied  with  them.  There  have  also  been  operational  and \nmanagement problems. Recently, the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) supplied \nanother  100  households  with  solar  home  systems  (SHS),  for  lighting  purposes.  The  barrier  to \nthis business is the high capital cost of PV systems in the 4.7\u20137.0 $/per kilowatt range (without \nstorage  facility).  The  total  cost  of  PV  systems  is  still  currently  higher  than  that  of  other  RE \nsystems.  However,  operational  costs  are  low  by  comparison,  and  the  operating  lifetime  is \nconsiderably  higher  than  most  other  RE  systems  (30  years,  with  a  warranty  time  of  15\u201325 \nyears).  However,  this  is  only  true  for  the  PV  modules.  In  off-grid  systems  either  stand-by \ngenerators  as  diesel  or  storage  facilities  as  batteries  are  required.  Both  options  increase \noperation  and/or  capital  costs  and  decrease  economic  lifetimes.  System  choice  will  thus  be  a \nfactor behind the successful development and adoption of this form of RE.  \n \n4. \nIn Pakistan, other than the use of bagasse for self-generation in the sugar industry, and \nsome  work  on  better  cook  stove  designs,  virtually  none  of  biomass  conversion  or  end  use \ntechnologies  has  been  deployed  beyond  an  experimental  stage.  Under  the  RE  policy,  the \nGovernment  plans  to  facilitate  the  construction  of  municipal  waste-to-energy  power  plants \nbased on landfill methane recovery and/or direct incineration of municipal solid waste, as well as \nmethane-based  power  production  from  dung-fuelled  biodigesters  set  up  by  the  private  sector \nindependently or in partnership with the public sector in and around the major towns and cities.  \nThere is considerable potential for this form of energy.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n     27 \n\nRisks  for  potential  investors  include  (a)  a  weak  RE-specific  legal  and  regulatory \n5. \nframework, especially with regard to the establishment of independent power producers (IPP), \n(b)  the  influence  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  and  National \nTransmission and Dispatch Corporation (NTDC) in relation to the negotiation of power purchase \nagreements  (PPA),  and  (c)  an  inadequate  tariff  regime  and  lack  of  well  designed  risk-sharing \nschemes  for  public  and  private  partnerships.  Investment  opportunities  are  also  hampered  by \ngovernance  constraints  and  still  cumbersome  procedures  for  investor  bidding  and  contract \nawards. \n \n6. \nThere  are  major  weaknesses  at  the  federal,  provincial  and  project  level.    These  are \nbeing  dealt  with.  However,  investment  programs  such  as  the  one  targeting  RE  development \nneed  targeted  and  concerted  actions  if  they  are  to  respond  to  policy,  planning,  evaluation, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  issues.    Information,  especially  on  best  practice  for  project \ndevelopment,  is  scarce  and  capacity  for  project  preparation  (including  due  diligence)  and \nimplementation is weak. RE is quite a new concept at both federal and provincial levels. There \nis no clear institutionalized system or practice for the sector, data collection is not extensive, and \nthere  is  limited  expertise  on  economic,  technical,  financial  and  safeguards  issues.  This  can \nchange  quickly  but  the  greatest  expertise  at  the  moment  lies  mostly  with  traditional  energy \nsources.  There  has  been  negligible  research  and  development  on  appropriate  technology  for \nRE. This is a particular issue for off-grid applications, where site- and region-specific solutions \nare common in other developing countries. Despite being one of the  most open  economies in \nthe  region,  Pakistan  still  faces  lengthy  pre-development  and  negotiation  processes,  which \nimpair the supply of equipment and materials.  This affects wind and solar projects in particular, \nfor which global supply shortages causes long lead times and price pressures. \n \n7. \nA  new  RE  policy  framework  has  been  developed  for  Pakistan.  This  is  supported  by \nprovincial RE policies based on the renewable energy development road map. The Government \nhas  prepared  an  investment  program  for  the  sector.    The  policy  framework  supports  this \nprogram, which focuses on RE development in the short to medium term (up to 2010). Within \nthis  period,  the  Government  will  finalize  a  more  comprehensive  renewable  energy  policy  to \nprovide  a  longer-term  development  perspective.  The  Government  has  also  completed \nguidelines for determination of tariff for wind power generation in 2006. ADB has been working \nwith the Government on policy issues and on the definition of the proposed investment program.     \n \n8. \nThe Government is aware of the need for private sector participation to deliver volume, \nefficiency  and  financing.  To  meet  an  additional  power  generation  requirement  of  143,310  MW \nduring  2005\u20132030,  a  Medium  Term  Development  Framework  2005\u20132030  (MTDF)  has  been \ndeveloped.    The  MTDF  calls  for  investment  in  all  sources  of  energy  equivalent  to  $150  billion \n($6  billion  a  year),  of  which  about  $2  billion  a  year  will  come  from  the  public  sector.  The \nremaining $4 billion will be funded by external sources, including the private sector and banks.  \nThe private sector will be allowed to operate with a range of project modalities, including build-\noperate-transfer (BOT) and private\u2013public partnerships (PPP). Multilateral banks such as ADB \nand the World Bank are also potential financiers. In 2002, the Government set out its Policy for \nPower  Generation  Projects  (PPGP),  providing  a  set  of  incentives,  along  with  a  regulatory \nregime, to attract the private sector. Provincial power generation policies are in the first stage of \nimplementation in NWFP and Punjab. These are based on the PPGP and will open the way for \nprivate sector investment.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n1. \n \n\nROAD MAP FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT \n\nA diagram of the investment plan is presented below.  \n\nFigure A3: An Overview of the Total Energy Sector \n\nTotal Energy Sector\n\nPower Sector  \n\nStrategy \n\u25a0Optimum Energy Mix \n\u25a0Maximum \nResources \n\u25a0Enhancing Participation  \n\nUtilization \n\nof \n\nIndigenous \n\nIssues  \n\u25a0Low Electrification Ratio (55% grid access) \n\u25a0High  Demand \nincrease) \n\nIncrease \n\n(8.3%  annual \n\nDiversification of Energy Mix (2004 \u2192 2030) \n\u25a0Oil     \n             30%   \u2192   19% \n\u25a0Renewable         0%   \u2192     3% \n\nNeeds  \n\u25a0Expansion of Generation Capacity \n\u25a0Expansion of Transmission Capacity \n\u25a0Further Power Sector Reform  \n\nRenewable Energy (RE) \n\nCurrent Issues  \n\u25a0Weak Enabling Environment \n\u25a0Weak Institutional Capacity \n\u25a0Lack of Data and Analysis \n\u25a0Absence of Research and Development \n\u25a0Supply Shortages \n\nPoverty Reduction Agenda  \n\u25a0 Investments in RE will improve social    \n   well-being, and improve the quality of life  \n   through both modern energy supply and \n   environment protection.  \n \nRegional Agenda  \n\u25a0Tackle climate change by reducing \n   greenhouse gas emissions \n\u25a0Energy Efficiency Initiatives \n\nRE Development Road Map (REDRM)  \n \n\u25a0Develop policy and regulatory framework \n\u25a0Conduct \nplanning \n\u25a0Implement  RE  projects  promoting  private \nsector participation \n\nevaluation \n\neconomic \n\nand \n\nCapacity Development Road Map  \n\u25a0Institutional strengthening of focus agencies, \n  e.g, AEDB  \n\u25a0Further \nagencies and stakeholders such as NEPRA \n\u25a0Market Facilitation, i.e., promotion of  consumer \n  access to RE services, information \n  dissemination, and awareness raising.   \n\nstrengthening  of  other \n\nrelevant \n\n \n\nAEDB = Alternative Energy Development Board, NEPRA = National Electric Power Regulating Authority. \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan, May 2005. \n \n2. \nObjective. Recognizing the need for energy security, the Government has set out a road \nmap for energy development over the medium to long term. The long-term plan develops a so-\ncalled 20/30 agenda (for 2005-2030). The medium-term plan is contained in the Medium Term \nDevelopment  Framework  for  2005\u20132010  (MTDF),  which  was  announced  in  May  2005  by  the \nPlanning  Commission.  The  main  objectives  are  (i)  to  increase  the  use  of  hydropower,  the \nexploration  and  production  of  oil,  gas,  and  coal  resources,  as  well  as  the  share  of  alternative \nenergy; (ii) through an institutionalized strategy, to optimize utilization of indigenous resources \nto  reduce  dependence  on  imported  fuel;  (iii)  to  create  an  environment  conducive  to  private \nsector investment; and (iv) to develop the energy plan from a regional perspective.  \n \n3. \nStrategy. The strategic vision for development of the energy sector calls for (i) supply to \nbe  based  on  an  optimal  energy  mix;  (ii)  maximum  utilization  of  indigenous  resources;  (iii) \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n     29 \n\npersuading the private sector to invest in the sector; and (iv) developing human resources and \ncapacity. Renewable energy (RE) is a key component of this strategic vision. The strategy also \nincludes  expanding  liquefied  petroleum  gas  supply  to  the  domestic  sector,  encouraging \ncompressed natural gas utilization in the transport sector, and importing liquefied natural gas to \nmeet short-term gas requirements, if feasible. Details are in supplementary appendixes A and B. \n \n4. \nRoad Map for Power Sector Development. The MTDF is based on a road map for the \npower  sector  that  was  developed  through  diagnostic  work  over  several  years.  This  identified \nobstacles to growth and came up with investment and non investment ideas for the medium to \nlong term. The investments include private and public sector transactions. To support both, the \nmap  also  highlighted  the  need  to  accompany  investments  with  reforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  This  is  the  essence  of  an  investment  program  for  the  period  of  2005\u20132015.  \nCurrently, over 65% of Pakistan\u2019s electricity comes from thermal sources, a little less than 30% \nfrom  hydro,  and  1%  from  other  sources.  Even  with  all  this  imported  energy,  Pakistan  faces  a \n20% power shortage. Only 55% of the population has access to electricity from the national grid. \nThe remaining 45% uses kerosene, fuel wood, and other forms of biofuels for lighting, cooking, \nand heating. Increase in generation capacity is closely linked to poverty reduction.   \n \n5. \n\nRoad Map for RE Development. RE development meets the following objectives:  \n(i) \nEnergy  security.  Greater  use  of  indigenous  renewable  resources  can  help \ndiversify Pakistan\u2019s energy mix and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil \nfuels, thereby helping to mitigate against supply disruptions and price fluctuation risks. \n \n(ii) \nEconomic  benefits  to  rural  communities.  When  properly  assessed  for  their \nexternalities,  RE  options  can  become  as  economically  competitive  as  conventional \nsupplies on a least-cost basis. \n\n \n\n(iii) \nSocial  equity.  Pakistan\u2019s  presently  low  per  capita  energy  consumption  can  be \nelevated through greater RE use. Issues relating to social equity\u2014such as equal rights \nand access for all citizens to modern energy supplies, and reducing poverty in deprived \nsections of society\u2014can also be addressed through widespread RE deployment. \n \nEnvironmental  protection.    Local  environmental  and  health  impacts  of  fossil \n(iv) \nfuel-powered electricity generation can be largely avoided through clean, RE alternatives. \nSimilarly,  displacing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  can  yield  significant  global  climate \nchange benefits, towards which Pakistan has pledged action under the Kyoto Protocol.  \n \n6. \nKey  Challenges  and  Opportunities.  The  Government  is  committed  to  RE  sector \ndevelopment.  Drafting  of  a  new  policy  framework,  named  the  Policy  for  Development  of \nRenewable Energy in Pakistan (RE policy), has been completed and submitted to the Cabinet \nfor its approval. The Government has delegated authority to the provinces to develop their own \ngenerating capacities of up to 50 MW and to place greater emphasis on RE. RE development is \nfully compatible with the Government\u2019s twin goals of energy security1 and promoting indigenous \nresource  utilization.  RE  development  is  also  one  of  the  key  features  of  the  Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction agenda. The renewable energy development road map presents a clear and \ncomprehensive  package  of  investments  and  changes  in  several  areas,  including  regulatory, \nlegislative,  and  financial.

Immediate  investment  in  the  RE  sector  would  be  mainly  for \nsmall to medium-sized hydropower and wind power generation. This is expected to be followed \nby solar and biomass. Total investment requirements for RE to reach 3.5% of the energy mix by \n2015  are  estimated  at  $3  billion,  assuming  acceptable  small,  mini,  and  micro  hydropower \ndevelopment will require investment of $1.1 billion. The investment needs for non-hydro based \nRE would also be about $1.1 billion. This makes the total investment program about $2.2 billion \n(Table  A4.2).  The  $1.1  billion  not  used  for  hydro  will  be  used  for,  among  others,  solar \nphotovoltaic  systems,  wind  energy,  and  biomass-based  power  generation.  The  financing  plan \nfor the investment program includes budget outlays from the federal and provincial governments, \nADB, the private sector, and other funding agencies. \n             \n\nTable A4.1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nPrivate Sector \nOther Funding Agencies \nGovernment \nTotal \n \n                             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTotal \n510 \n900 \n400 \n390 \n2,200 \n\nShare (%) \n23.2 \n40.9 \n18.2 \n17.7 \n100.0 \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nTable A4.2: Renewable Energy and Hydropower Development Investment Program \n\n($ million) \n\n           \n\nSolar Wind / \n\nBiomass / \nOthers\n\nYear \n\nRenewables a\n\nHydro \n\nTotal \n\nSmall to \nMedium \nHydro\n525\n \n600\n \n1,103\n \n2,025\n \n2,888\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n1,001 \n  \n1,232 \n  \n2,187 \n  \n3,940 \n  \n5,578 \n  \n13,937 \n  \n\n2006\u25002010 \n2011\u25002015 \n2016\u25002020 \n2021\u25002025 \n2026\u25002030 \nTotal\n\n3\n \n92\n \n92\n \n92\n \n92\n \n371\n \na As per S.R.O.

About 1,600 households had been electrified with off-grid solar power by \nJuly 2006. The long-term investment need for this program is projected at around $370 million \nby 2030. Physical investment for biomass and solar-based power generation would be explored \nas part of nonphysical investment (e.g., capacity development with a greater emphasis on rural \nelectrification). The Governments of NWFP and Punjab province have also developed long-term \ninvestment plans for hydropower. Other renewable energy projects will be also considered, but \nthese  are  at  early  stages  of  development.  In  NWFP,  a  total  of  34  projects  (7,176  MW)  are \nidentified, of which 17 projects (3,496 MW) will be implemented by the public sector. The other \n17 projects (3,680 MW) are to be implemented by the private sector. The total estimated cost of \nthese  projects  is  $9.33  billion.  The  Government  of  Punjab  has  identified  306  potential  sites \nsuitable  for  small  to  medium-sized  hydro  power  stations  on  canal  systems.  The  total  power \npotential is 347 MW. Among these, 48 sites have a capacity potential of more than 2 MW and \nadd up to a total capacity of 150 MW.  \n \n5. \nMany  financial  and  fiscal  incentives  are  available  in  Policy  for  Power  Generation \nProjects, 2002.

It will cover \nassistance to federal, provincial and program implementing agencies (IAs). It will be related to \n(i) planning and formulation of policy, including regulatory and legal framework, and incentives \nto  facilitate private  sector  investment,  (ii)  development  of  adequate  management  and  financial \nsystems, targeting efficient project evaluation, monitoring and reporting (iii) expert support and \ntraining of staff in relation to best practice project preparation work \u2013 in essence covering due \ndiligence  on  technical,  commercial,  legal,  financial,  operational,  management,  safeguards, \ngovernance, financial management, anti-corruption, procurement, fiduciary oversight and project \nimplementation  matters  and  (iv)  establishment of  systems  and  procedures,  backed  by  training \nand computer software and hardware to set up modern management and financial information \nsystems.  The  capacity  component  combines  \u201cbig  picture\u201d  strategic,  policy,  planning  and \nmonitoring at the top level with project preparation, evaluation, monitoring and reporting at the \ninvestment and IA level. A general overview of the capacity development component is given in \nFigure A5.1. More details are given in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n\nFigure A5.1: General Overview of Capacity Development Component \n\n\"Global\" Capacity Development/Federal Level\nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Water and Power, Alternative Energy Development Board\n\n\u25c6 Policy \n\u25c6 Planning \n\u25c6 Evaluation\n\u25c6 Reporting \n\u25c6 Information Systems (Monitoring)\n\n\u25c6 Action Plan\n\u25c6 Investments\n\u25c6 Evaluation\n  \n\nProgram Management / Provincial / Implementing Agency Level\n\nMinistry of Water and Power, Alternative Energy Development Board\n\n\u25c6 Technical \n\u25c6 Financial \n\u25c6 Legal \n\u25c6 Safeguards \n\u25c6 Others \n\n\u25c6 Renewable Energy  Action Plan Implementation\n\u25c6 Private Sector Investments\n\u25c6 Fiduciary Oversight\n\u25c6 Enabling Regulations\n\nImplementing Agency Level \n\nProvincial Irrigation and Power Departments\n\n\u25c6 Technical \n\u25c6 Safeguards\n\u25c6 Financial \n\n\u25c6 Procurement\n\u25c6 Accounting\n\u25c6 Administration\n\n\u25c6 Human Resource Management\n\u25c6 Management Information System\n  \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimate \n\n \n \n2. \nFederal Level: At the federal level the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) is \nthe  main  player  involved  in  the  investment  program.  It  represents  the  Ministry  of  Water  and \nPower. AEDB will become the single agency dealing with renewable energy (RE) projects. To \nassist AEDB implement its mandate, the capacity development component caters for assistance \nin the following areas:  \n \n\n(i) \nDevelopment  of  RE  policy.  A  draft  RE  Policy  Framework  has  already  been \nprepared  by  AEDB.  This  needs  to  be  institutionalized.  With  assistance  from  ADB,  the \nagency will work on the development of a comprehensive and final RE policy backed by \nan  action  plan,  supported  by  an  appropriate  tariff  determination  system  and  regulatory \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\npowers.  This activity becomes \u201cwork in progress\u201d.  The policy agenda will be reviewed \non a regular basis, molded to specific and changing circumstances. It will be structured \nto cover each of the sub-sectors (wind, solar, biomass and hydel) and phased according \nto provincial level priorities and readiness.  Kick starting the process with a draft policy is \nless dangerous than starting the process with a rigid \u201ccast in stone\u201d framework.   RE is \nnew  to  Pakistan  and  a  learning  process  is  required  before  formalizing  all  the  policy \narrangements. This is in effect the equivalent of a pilot scheme backed by extensive due \ndiligence. Mainstreaming the policy will require some time. The capacity component will \nassist  this  thinking  process.  The  assistance  will  also  focus  on  planning  and  on \nmonitoring and evaluation. AEDB needs to put in place better systems to deliver on both \nof these fronts. \n \nLicensing  of  RE  projects.  AEDB  will  develop  a  single  window  procedure  for \n(ii) \nobtaining licenses for RE projects. A streamlined procedure will be prepared accordingly \n\n(iii) \nIncentive  package.  To  encourage  private  sector  investment  in  RE,  AEDB  will \nfacilitate  the  preparation  by  NEPRA  (regulator)  of  an  incentive  package  including  a \nrevised tariff regime with NTDC on preferential dispatch \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv)  Monitoring and supervision. A monitoring and supervision/reporting system will \nbe  developed  to  quickly  capture  the  trends  and  quality  of  new  RE  investments  and \nreforms. Institutional set-up in the Renewable Energy Sector is given in Figure A5.2 \n\n \n3. \nProvincial  The  capability  of  the  Irrigation  and  Power  Departments  (IPDs)  at  the \nprovincial  government  level  needs  improvements.  The  capacity  development  component  will \nfocus on these and provide assistance in the following areas:  \n \n\n(i) \nProject  management.  The  executing  agencies  (EAs)  responsible  for  the \ninvestment program at the provincial level (IPDs) need to oversee in a professional and \nefficient manner the various investment operations planned over the next few years. This \nrequires  sound  management  skills  and  systems.    Under  the  capacity  development \ncomponent,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  establish  such  systems.  It  will  also  set  up \nteams, and trained them, on best practice.  Evaluation, monitoring and reporting will be \npart of the work. \n \n(ii) \nDue diligence.   The EAs need to coordinate the preparation of a deal flow. To \ndo  this,  their  counterparts  at  the  project  level  (IAs)  need  to  commission  due  diligence \nteams with expertise and experience in key areas \u2013 relevant to the EAs but also to the \noperating policies and procedures of ADB.  Managing this process requires people and \nsystems.  The  program  will  finance  the  services  of  external  independent  advisors  (see \nbelow  for  IAs)  but  also  a  management  team  to  coordinate  their  work.    The  component \nwill finance the training of local staff to ultimately take full control over the process. \n\nImplementing  Agency  Level.  The  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  need  to  improve \n\n \n4. \ncapacity as a whole. The capacity development component will focus the following areas: \n \n\n(i) \nInvestment  program  management.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  establish \nteams, systems and practices to manage the due diligence process associated with all \nthe investments and to of all investments. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \nFigure A5.2: Institutional Set-up in the Renewable Energy Sector \n\nGOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN \n\nFederal Level\n\nMINISTRY OF \nFINANCE \n\nMINISTRY OF \nWATER AND \nPOWER \n\nMINISTRY OF \nENVIRONMENT \nCDM UNIT \n\nNational Electric \nPower Regulatory \nAuthority \n(NEPRA) \n\nWater and Power \nDevelopment \nAuthority \n(WAPDA) \n\nAlternative \nEnergy \nDevelopment \nBoard (AEDB) \n\nPrivate Power \nInvestment \nBureau (PPIB) \n\nProvincial Level\n\nPunjab \nProvince \n\nBaloochistan \nProvince \n\nSindh \nProvince \n\nNorthern \nArea \n\nAshad \nJammu \nKashmir \n\nNorth \nWestern \nFrontier \nProvince  \n\nPunjab \nPower \nDev\u2019t \nCompany \nLimited \n\nSarhad \nHydel \nDev\u2019t \nOrg.  \n\nIrrigation \nand \nPower \nDept \n \n\nIrrigation \nand \nPower \nDept \n \n\nIrrigation \nand \nPower \nDept \n \n\nIrrigation \nand \nPower \nDept \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nAssistance  will  also  be  provided  to  ensure  the  IAs  undertake  appropriate  evaluation, \nmonitoring and reporting work.  A program management team will be put in place to do \nthis  work.  It  will  define  work  plans  and  supervise  their  implementation.  It  will  also \noversee the implementation of the investments. This team will be an entry point to ADB \nprogram supervision teams. The latter will also work with AEDB and provincial level EAs.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n41 \n\nDue  diligence  for  deal  flow  processing.  The investment program will finance \n(ii) \nthe services of external independent advisors to undertake work on technical, financial, \neconomic,  governance,  fiduciary,  financial  management,  procurement,  anti-corruption, \ndisbursement and safeguards areas. These teams will be called upon on demand. They \nwill  be  financed  under  the  first  tranche.    Subsequent  tranches  could  expand  on  this \nshould  it  be  required.  One  area  that  will  require  special  assistance  is  related  to \nenvironmental and social safeguards. Assistance will be provided through the fielding of \nconsultants  and  ADB  missions  to  ensure  that  the  right  procedures  are  followed  at  all \ntimes.  Similar  work  will  be  related  to  governance.  Governance  will  need  to  be \ninstitutionalized  and  public  disclosure  systems  will  be  developed  and  put  in  place.  The \ncapacity component will also focus on fiduciary oversight. Strong internal audits will be \nset up to ensure full transparency in this area.   \n\nProgram \n\nimplementation.  The \n\n(iii) \nthe \nestablishment  of  sound  project  evaluation,  monitoring  and  reporting  systems  (Table \nA5.3).  A  model  will  be  developed  and  implemented  with  finance  made  available  under \nthe  first  tranche.  The  objective  is  to  effectively  monitor  and  supervise  the  program \nimplementation  and  its  results.  Reporting  will  take  place  at  various  levels  within  the \nGovernment.  It will also be required between the implementing agencies and ADB. \n\nrequire  assistance  with \n\nIAs  will \n\nFigure A5.3: Summary of Capacity Development Component \n\nCapacity Development Component\n\nMFF / Project Management\n\nPolicy & \nPlanning \n\nDue \nDiligence\n\nSector\nInvestments\n\nEvaluation, \n   Monitoring  \nand Reporting  \n\n \n\n \n\n     Source: Asian Development Bank \n\nMore Specific Inputs for Capacity Development \n\n \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  capacity  development  program  will  require  a  mix  of  advisory  services,  short  and \nlong-term in nature.  Some will focus on policy formulation, others on project preparation and a \nnumber on systems and training.  AEDB will coordinate the capacity development component..  \nIt will be assisted by a team of international and domestic experts, financed under an advisory \ntechnical  assistance  package.  The  exact  scope  and  details  of  the  capacity  development  for \nIPDs will be decided by this team and updated within each Periodic Financing Request (PFR). \nEach new package of assistance will be discussed and agreed with ADB and the participating \nprovinces.  A  summary  of  the  capacity  development  effort  is  presented  below  in  Table  A.5.1. \nSome specific activities are highlighted below. \n \n6. \nInformation  Services.  There  is  a  need  to  improved  knowledge  gathering  and \ndissemination on RE. This will be part of the capacity component.  Experts will be fielded for this \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\npurpose. One outcome is to establish benchmarks and information on best practices in each of \nthe  sub-sectors.  A  data  room  will  be  set  up.  This  will  gather  and  process  information  on  RE \ndevelopment world-wide, RE financing instruments, carbon trading, most suitable procurement \nmodalities,  investor  profiles,  equipment  manufacturers,  financial  institutions  with  interest  and \nexperience  in  the  sector,  consultant  rostra,  tariff  regimes,  data  collection  approaches  for \nsubsectors and so forth. This information will be provided to AEDB, the EAs and the IAs. It will \nalso be shared with the due diligence teams and the project management experts.   \n \nSystem  Management.  Implementation  of  investment  program  requires  an  information \n7. \nmanagement system. This will be set up at each level (federal, provincial and project) and will \nbe integrated. It will feed into ADB for reporting purposes. Expert advisors will be fielded and the \nappropriate hardware and software purchased under the capacity development component. The \nsystem  will  need  maintenance  and  upkeep.  The  authorities  will  allocate  adequate  funding  for \nthis purpose. The component will be structured into several contracts, each focusing on specific \nthemes and tasks.   \n\n \n\nincluding \n\nrequirements \n\nProgram  Management.  The  program  implementation  work  requires  a  management \n8. \nteam.  This  will  be  established  and  provide  support  to  AEDB,  the  EA  and  IAs  with  the \nmanagement of the implementation process.  It will schedule work plans, consultant selection, \nsubproject  preparation  and  approvals,  compliance  with  warranties  and  representations, \nreporting  to  decision-makers  and  ADB  and  measure  results.  The  preparation  of  candidate \nsubprojects  in  the  next  tranches  will  need  to  meet  the  agreed  selection  criteria  in  terms  of \ntechnical, economic and financial feasibility. The team will be accountable to the authorities for \nthis.  It will also look into the sequencing of the subprojects and their implementation.  The team \nwill work closely with ADB missions to report on the progress made with the program but also \non  ADB\u2019s \nfinancial,  governance,  procurement,  disbursement, \nenvironmental and safeguard policies and procedures. \n \nTraining.  This  will  cover  (i)  business  management  including  portfolio  review,  project \n9. \nimplementation  and  program  management;  (ii)  technical  operations  and  maintenance;  (iii) \nfinancial  and  economic  management,  including  accounting  (e.g.  double  entry  bookkeeping, \nregister,  accrual-basis  accounting);  contracting,  procurement  and  inventory  management, \nfinancial reporting, management information system (MIS) and economics on cost recovery and \ntariff setting; and (iv) project development, site identification and best practice project design. \n \n10. \nCorporate Development. This includes help with the establishment of corporate entities \nto construct, own, maintain and operate RE ventures. The companies, initially wholly owned by \nthe provincial governments, will operate commercially, and in the longer term may be partially or \nentirely privatized. Every implementing agency participating in the program will be requested to \nsubmit a time-bound corporate development plan.  \n\n \n\n11. \nGovernance  and  Consultations.  The  tasks  will  include  help  to  set  up  systems  and \nprocedures  (and  train  staff)  so  that  all  activities  under  the  investment  program  are  carried  out \nwith  full  transparency,  adequate  consultation  and  participation  from  civil  society,  deliver \naccountability, and show zero-tolerance for any form of corruption. To ensure transparency and \ngood governance, each EA will publicly disclose on their website information on how the funds \nare  being  used.  The  website  will  present  financial  statements  and  track  procurement  contract \nawards. It will include information on, among others, about the list of participating bidders, name \nof  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  the  contract \nawarded, the list of goods and/or services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n43 \n\nFiduciary  Oversight.  Fiduciary  oversight  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  overall \n12. \nInvestment Program. Available public financial management assessment diagnostic tools such \nas  the  World  Bank\u2019s  comprehensive  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment1 and  public \nexpenditure  review, 2 and  ongoing  ADB  assistance  programs 3 were  reviewed  to  assess  the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  systems,  identify  issues  and  constraints  and  ongoing  reforms  and \nrecommendations in the areas of budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds transfer, audit \nand  legislative  oversight  to  ensure  public  funds  are  efficiently  and  effectively  managed  and \nutilized.  \n \n13.  Monitor/Reporting.  The Government has designed an indicative monitoring framework \nfor implementation of a new RE Development Road Map (REDRM). Pilot projects launched for \nrural  and  household  RE  application  and  program  design  will  also  be  monitored  as  part  of  the \ncomprehensive monitoring effort. At subproject level, quarterly progress reports will be prepared \nfor  the  individual  subprojects  and  submitted  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of \nphysical progress, problems, and difficulties encountered. A summary of financial accounts will \nbe produced. This will consist of loan expenditures during the period, year to date, and total to \ndate.  A  Project  Completion  Report  will  be  submitted  within  6  months  following  completion  of \neach subproject and PFR. In the first tranche subprojects, SHYDO and Punjab IPD will maintain \nseparate  accounts  for  each  Loan.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  SHYDO \nand  Punjab  IPD  will  submit  annual  pro  forma  project  accounts  and  un-audited  financial \nstatements, and will submit audited project accounts and financial statements within 6 months of \nthe  close  of  the  financial  year.  An  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  hired  by \nSHYDO and Punjab IPD to conduct the audit. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nTo  enable  the  implementation  of  the  capacity  development  component  to  get  off  the \nground quickly and effectively, soon after the first loan under the program is declared effective, \ntwo  individual  consultants  (one  international  and  one  domestic)  will  be  hired  under  the  TA4 to \nreview and finalize the overall capacity development component program. They will then assist \nthe  AEDB  and  the  IAs  to  carry  out  all  the  other  necessary  preparatory  actions,  including  the \nengagement of a management team. The terms of reference of these consultants are given in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Cost Estimates  \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n\nThe  cost  of  the  capacity  development  component  is  estimated  at  $25  million  over  the \n15. \nprogram  period.    The  funding  will  be  provided mostly  from  the  program  funds  under  the  MFF.  \nSubject to availability, it is possible that both grants and TA resources could be made available \nover the period to finance this component.  The key feature is the commitment of government to \nadopt  this  component.  This  commitment  will  be  captured  under  the  various  legal  agreements \nwith ADB.   \n\n                                                 \n1 World  Bank.  2003.

The \npresent Framework needs to be expanded to cover the rules, implementation regulations, and \ndetails of appropriate incentives to promote RE development. It also needs to be converted to a \ncomprehensive  Renewable  Energy  Policy  (RE  Policy)  for  the  country  to  provide  long  term \ndevelopment perspective. During the appraisal Mission of proposed RESDIP, the Government \nrequested  technical  assistance 1  (TA)  for  (i)  formulation  of  RE  policy  and  (ii)  developing \ninstitutional capacity of Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) to implement RESDIP in \nline with the Framework Financing Agreement between the Government and ADB. \n \n2. \nThe  Alternative  Energy  Development  Board  (AEDB)  was  created  in  2003  to  act  as \nfacilitating agency coordinating both at federal and provincial agencies. Key aspects of AEDB\u2019s \nmandate  are  to:  (i)  act  as  the  central  agency  for  awareness  raising,  policy  and  regulatory \ndevelopment,  and  establishment  of  domestic  technologies  and  manufacturing  facilities  for  RE; \n(ii) lower barriers for the introduction of RE and develop market-based incentives to promote RE \ninvestments, especially from the private sector; and (iii) initiate and incubate RE projects. ADB, \ntogether  with  other  development  partners,  e.g.,  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP) and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), has assisted AEDB \nto  enhance  its  capacity.  As  a  result,  a  draft  RE  Policy  Framework  for  the  country  has  been \nprepared  and  time-bound  targets  have  been  set  in  for  RE  development.  AEDB  has  been  also \nsuccessful in coordinating small-medium size hydro power development in provincial levels and \nwind-power  expansion  with  the  support  from  independent  power  producers,  in  particular  in \nSindh  province.  However,  AEDB\u2019s  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be  further  strengthened  to \nimplement the time-bound RE development program. AEDB is expected to play a pivotal role for \nimplementation  of  the  proposed  RESDIP  as  a  facilitator  among  various  federal  and  provincial \nagencies. (More details are given in Supplementary Appendix F) \n \nA. \n\nPurpose and Output  \n\n3. \nThe goal of the TA is to facilitate the process of the development of Renewable Energy \nPolicy  of  Pakistan.  The  purpose  of  the  Policy  is  to  expedite  the  process  of  developing \nindigenous,  nonpolluting,  and  renewable  sources  of  energy  to  help  meet  Pakistan\u2019s  power \nshortage  and  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  power  system,  including  such  issues  in \nrural  areas.  This  will  also  help  addressing  energy  security  concerns  and  poverty  reduction \nprogram of the Government. The TA will result in: (i) allowing AEDB to timely finalize RE policy \nand  carry  out  its  mandate  to  facilitate  and  coordinate  various  RE  initiatives,  and  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment of existing and new AEDB staff. \n \nB. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities  \n\nThere will be two main components of the proposed TA. The first one is to facilitate the \n4. \nprocess of development of a comprehensive Renewable Energy Policy. The second component \ncovers  the  capacity  development  of  the  Alternative  Energy  Development  Board  (AEDB).  The \noutcome  will  include  the  Government  approved  comprehensive  Renewable  Energy  Policy  and \nenhanced capacity of AEDB.  The TA will help increase the use of RE in Pakistan and decrease \nreliance  of  imported  fossil  fuels.  It  will  help  address  energy  security  concerns  while  reducing \npoverty  in  particular  in  rural  areas.  No  adverse  social  or  environmental  impacts  are  expected. \nDuring  the  appraisal  mission  of  REDSIP,  all  concerned  agencies  have  been  consulted. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in Business Opportunities (internet version) on 26 July 2006. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nProvincial and national level workshops and discussions will be organized to disseminate the TA \nresults. There will be a large number of consultation workshops and meetings during the policy \nformulation  process.  Final  Report  will  be  made  available  to  the  concern  stakeholders.  The \nwebsites  of  AEDB,  provincial  governments  will  also  be  used  to  disseminate  the  TA  findings. \nFinalized Renewable Energy Development Policy will be widely made available to the public. \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing  \n\n5. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $980,000  equivalent,  of  which  $600,000  is  in \nforeign exchange costs and $380,000 is in local currency costs. ADB will finance $800,000 on a \ngrant basis. The Government will finance the remaining local currency costs of $180,000.  \n \n\nTable A6: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($,000) \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n1.  Consultants \na.

A  25-year  period  was  considered  for  subproject \nanalysis, including a 4- or 5-year construction period and 20 years of operation. These are \nconsistent with the loan repayment cycle of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. The \nresidual  capital  asset  value  was  estimated  using  a  2%  depreciation  rate  over  the  assets\u2019 \neconomic  lives  of  50  years.  Financial  prices  reflect  market  prices  for  goods  and  services, \nincluding a 5% duty levied on imported equipment. The exchange rate of PRs60 = $1 was \nused  for  purposes  of  the  analysis.  Incremental  financial  benefits  were  limited  to  sales  of \nelectricity generated from the eight subprojects2 to the Central Power Purchasing Authority, \nacting  as  agent  for  National  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company  (NTDC)  or  distribution \ncompanies.  Operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  estimated  at  3%  of  total  capital \nexpenditure, and an allowance for plant overhaul after 10 years of operation was made, at a \ncost  of  20%  of  original  capital  expenditure.  Annual  insurance  expense  at  0.25%  of  initial \ncapital  expenditure  was  allowed.  Plant  energy  use  at  0.5%  of  gross  generation  was \nassumed,  and  average  plant  availability  of  97%  modeled. 3 Under  federal  and  provincial \ngovernment policies, owners of small hydropower projects need not pay income or turnover \ntax, although Punjab may impose a water use charge of PRs0.15/kWh.4 \n \nB. \n \n2. \nNational Electric Power Regulating Authority (NEPRA) policy requires cost recovery \nas  the  basis  for  off-take  tariff  determination  and  automatic  tariff  adjustment  to  account  for \nfuel  price,  inflation,  and  exchange  rate  variation  is  available.  However,  NEPRA  is  yet  to \nestablish an off-take tariff for small hydropower projects because tariffs for less than 50 MW \nare  determined  by  provincial  governments  and  endorsed  by  NEPRA.  The  most  recent \nreference  point  of  medium  and  large  projects  include  the  PRs2.8/kWh  levelized  tariff 5 \nrecently  awarded  to  a  private  developer  for  the  New  Bong  Escape  hydropower  project \n(84 MW), upfront PRs3.5/kWh for two thermal power projects, and PRs5.7/kWh for 50-MW \nwind-based  power  generation  tariff.  Provincial  government\u2019s  projects,  such  as  the  81-MW \nMalakand  III  by  Sarhad  Hydel  Development  Corporation  (SHYDO),  North-West  Frontier \nProvince (NWFP) is expected to receive a PRs2.8/kWh wholesale tariff. Public entities such \nas SHYDO and Punjab Irrigation and Power Department are allowed to earn 15% return on \nequity, plus full recovery of debt service and operation and maintenance costs. The levelized \ntariffs for the eight subprojects, calculated in accordance with the NEPRA approach, range \nfrom PRs2.3/kWh to PRs2.8/kWh for the three NWFP subprojects,6 and from PRs2.4/kWh to \nPRs2.9/kWh for the five Punjab subprojects.7  \n \n3. \nThe retail tariffs currently range from PRs1.32/kWh (first 50 kWh for residential users) \nto PRs7.0/kWh (commercial users), resulting in an average retail tariff of about PRs4.2/kWh. \n\nTariff Methodology \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n2  Generation connected to the grid at 132 kV and higher is sold to NTDC and lower voltages are sold to the local \n\ndistribution company.   \n\n3  A non-unity availability factor allows for unscheduled plant outages.    \n4  Punjab Power Generation Policy 2006 includes provision for a water use charge of PRs0.15/kWh, although it is \n\nunclear if this charge would be imposed on a public entity. It has been excluded from tariff calculation.  \n\n5  The wholesale tariff of PRs2.8/kWh is levelized over the 25-year term. The tariff is PRs3.8/kWh in the first year, \ndoes not exceed PRs3.6/kWh in any subsequent year, and provides an average of PRs3.6/kWh for the first 10 \nyears. \n\n6  Indicative levelized wholesale tariffs in NWFP using NEPRA\u2019s methodology are (i) PRs2.8/kWh for Machai, (ii) \n\nPRs2.3/kWh for Ranolia, and (iii) PRs2.7/kWh for Daral Khwar. \n\n7  Indicative levelized wholesale tariffs in Punjab are (i) PRs2.8/kWh for Chianwali, (ii) PRs2.6/kWh for Okara, (iii) \n\nPRs2.6/kWh for Marala, (iv) PRs2.5/kWh for Pakpattan, and (v) PRs2.9/kWh for Deg Outfall. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\nPakistan has incurred significant increase in tariffs due to its heavy dependence on thermal \npower generation (i.e., imported oil) and recently adopted the long-term strategy to enhance \nuse of less-costly resources via increasing the share of hydro, coal, and alternative energy in \nthe  overall  energy  mix.  Provided  the  current  average  generation  tariff  level  of  about \nPRs3.0/kWh,  the  proposed  wholesale  hydropower  generation  tariffs  are  affordable.  This  is \neven  more  evident  because  current  retail  as  well  as  generation  tariff  levels  are  intensely \nexposed to upward pressure due to rising fuel costs. The proposed hydropower generation \ntariffs  are  the  least-cost  option  available  and  the  financial  sustainability  of  implementing \nagencies (IAs) with the proposed indicative off-take tariffs are found to be fully satisfactory. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nTo  estimate  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  the  eight  subprojects,  it \nwas  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  consist  of  ADB  lending  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources  facility  to  cover  80%  of  total  project  costs,  and  the  balance  though  government \ncontributions in the form of equity, i.e., budgetary support. LIBOR (6 month) stood at 5.64% \non 30 June 2006, to which a 60 basis point spread and a 40 basis point rebate were applied. \nProvincial government entities such as SHYDO and Punjab Irrigation and Power Department \nare required to target a 15% return on equity. This compares to the current 3-year Karachi \nInter-Bank Offered Rate of 11% and the yield on the most recently tendered 20-year State \nBank  of  Pakistan  bond  of  9.99%  (June  2004),  indicating  a  margin  over  indicative  risk-free \nrates  of  400-500  basis  points.  This  is  considered  sufficient  margin  for  these  relatively \nlow-risk small hydropower projects. On the basis of these assumptions, combined WACC is \nestimated at 4.4%., as shown in Table A10.1.  \n \n\nTable A10.1 Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n\nItem \n\nADB Loan  \n\nGovernment Equity \nContribution \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n        145 \n\n30 \n          20% \n\n115 \n           80% \n\n 100% \n \n \n \n \n \n4.43% \n\nA.

Incremental  benefit  and \ncost  for  each  subproject  was  estimated  and  aggregated  to  provide  overall  project  internal \nrate of return. Using aggregated average PRs2.6/kWh equivalent to USc 4.4/kwh8 wholesale \ntariff for NWFP and PRs2.7 equivalent to USc 4.5/kwh for Punjab, the FIRR rates compare \nfavorably with the estimated value of WACC standing at 4.4% rendering financial viability for \nall  the  identified  subprojects  under  the  first  tranche  of  the  investment  facility.  Provided \noperational  efficiency,  fuel  savings,  and  potential  clean  development  mechanism  credit \nrevenue while minimizing adverse environment impact from greenhouse gas emissions were \nincorporated  (as  additional  revenue  sources),  further  increase  in  FIRR  is  expected.

Details are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\n \n\nE. \n\ntime-bound  action  plan \n\nfor  corporate  development \n\nRisk Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n6. \nLegal  and  regulatory  risk,  while  considered  low  to  moderate,  arises  mainly  as  a \nconsequence of the number of public entities that could have a stake in implementing and \noperating  the  subprojects  due  to  complications  in  procedural  requirements  from  various \nministries.  The  AEDB,  as  Executing  Agency,  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  overall  project \ncoordination  across  this  array  of  entities,  in  promoting  private  investment  in  generating \ncapacity by independent power producers or direct equity participation in the RE sector, and \nin  closing  the  power  supply  deficit  by  building  a  transparent  and  consistent  enabling \nenvironment.  Technical  assistance  for  renewable  energy  policy  formulation  and  capacity \ndevelopment  of  AEDB  is  incorporated  into  the  investment  program  design.  A  holistic \napproach  will  be  adopted  to  address  fiduciary  risks  mainly  arising  from  lack  of  a  coherent \ninstitutional  framework  at  the  federal,  provincial,  and  company  levels  covering  legal, \ngovernance,  organization,  financial  (budgets  and  business  systems),  and  commercial \naspects  of  business.  A \nin \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  ADB  assisted  in  developing  an  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement manual for Pakistan (2006), which will be adopted to mitigate fiduciary risks at \nsubproject level. \n \n7. \nFinancial risks at subproject level include (i) increase in prices of cement, steel, fuel, \nand  other  raw  materials;  (ii)  delay  in  project  implementation;  (iii)  delay  in  power  purchase \nagreement  (PPA)  negotiations  and  tariff  determination;  and  (iv)  failure  to  mobilize  the \nnecessary  counterpart  funds.  These  risks  are  considered  to  be  manageable,  for  these \nreasons: (i) raw material prices are at an all-time high and are expected to stabilize during \nthe implementation period, and any increase will be passed through in the tariff, which will be \ndetermined on actual rather than projected capital costs; (ii) IAs\u2019 implementation capacity will \nbe strengthened through a technical assistance component under the proposed investment \nprogram; (iii) PPA execution will be included as a precondition for construction-related loan \ndisbursements; and (iv) adequate counterpart funding will be made available from the annual \ndevelopment  programs  of  the  provincial  governments.  Multitranche  financing  facility  loan \nmodality  also  offers  added  flexibility  with  regard  to  loan  amount  in  case  of  cost  overruns, \nimplementation delays, and project readiness by fund recipients. Financial sustainability was \nevaluated by reviewing each IA\u2019s financial pro forma statements and found to be acceptable.  \n \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken for the subprojects in the first tranche. Aggregate \n8. \nimpacts of each subproject are summarized below. In all cases, 1-year implementation delay \nto 10% decrease in tariff, the expected FIRR was at minimum 6.8%. It can be concluded that \nthe proposed subprojects are robust and can adequately absorb the normal risks. \n \n\nis \n\nTable A10.2: NWFP and Punjab Sensitivity Analyses \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nBase case \n1 year delay \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n10% capital cost increase  \n\n10% increase in O&M cost \n\n10% decrease on tariff \n\nNWFP \n\nFIRR \n\n8.8% \n8.7% \n\n7.9% \n\n8.6% \n\n7.5% \n\n \n\nFNPV \n\n938,187 \n88,881 \n\n1,657,835 \n\n1,816,413 \n\n 1,342,241  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSwitching \nValue \n\nPunjab \n\n \n\nFIRR \n\nFNPV \n\n \nSwitching \nValue \n\n \n \n\n69% \n\n159% \n\n(33%) \n\n8.1% \n7.8% \n\n8.2% \n\n7.8% \n\n6.8% \n\n1,168,299 \n841,840 \n\n1,373,826 \n\n079,586 \n\n737,991  \n\n0% \n0% \n\n(57%) \n\n132% \n\n(27%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(  )  =  negative.

\nFinancial projections and analyses have been prepared for Sarhad Hydel Development \nOrganization  (SHYDO)  and  Punjab  Power  Development  Company  (PDC).  While  there  will  be \nseparate  power  purchase  agreements  for  each  plant  (with  SHYDO  and  PDC  as  the  power \nproducers),  they  will  be  simple  and  standardized,  as,  in  essence,  there  is  a  single  wholesale \nbuyer (the Central Power Purchasing Authority, acting as agent for National Transmission and \nDespatch  Company  [NTDC]  or  distribution  companies).  Financial  sustainability  of  NTDC  and \ndistribution companies, as ultimate purchasers of electricity from the subprojects, will depend on \ntheir  ability  to  pass  through  bulk  tariff  increases  to  end-users.  Thus,  the  multi-year  retail  tariff \ndeterminations  of  National  Electric  Power  Regulating  Authority  (NEPRA)  are  important  in \nallowing distributors and NTDC to recover bulk electricity costs through retail tariffs. Therefore, \nfinancial sustainability of these entities is ultimately a function of the regulator\u2019s ability to set and \nreset  cost-reflective  tariffs  and  of  their  affordability  to  end-use  consumers.  Once  a  tariff  is  set \nand a retrieve collection system is in place, SHYDO and PDC will have no problems with their \nfinancial sustainability. Domestic inflation is projected using domestic cost escalation factors for \n2006\u201320101 published  by  ADB  and  at  7.0%  per  year  from  2010  onward.  International  inflation \nforecasts use the international cost escalation factors 2005\u201320092 published by the World Bank, \nand  thereafter  are  assumed  to  increase  at  2%  per  year.  Exchange  rate  forecasts  have  been \nmade on the basis of inflation differentials. More details are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n2. \nThe hydropower investment requirements of NWFP are quite substantial, amounting to \n$753  million.3 Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department\u2019s  (Punjab  IPD\u2019s)  long-term  investment \nplans  are  relatively  smaller.  They  are  mostly  confined  to  canal-based  small-scale  low  head \nhydropower plants. SHYDO has four ongoing projects. Its Malakand-III is financed by 60% debt \nand 40% equity, while the remaining three are 100% financed by the Annual Development Fund \nof  NWFP\u2019s  provincial  government.  Punjab  IPD  has  two  ongoing  projects,  Khokhra  and  LBDC \nSahiwal, which are entirely financed by its provincial government equity. It is assumed that the \ntwo  implementing  agencies  will  increase  new  generation  capacity  in  the  outer  years  at  a \nmeasurable rate where long-term investment plans are not available. Detailed assumptions for \nSHYDO and Punjab IPD (PDC) are in Supplementary Appendix I. Financing plans of on-going \ninvestments are taken as per existing arrangements. Interest and principal repayments of ADB-\nassisted  projects  are  assumed  to  have  20-year  repayment  periods,  excluding  a  5-year  grace \nperiod,  at  LIBOR  plus  the  required  spread  of  60  basis  points.  The  federal  government  is \nexpected to bear the foreign exchange risk. Interest during the grace period is assumed to be \nfinanced by the lenders. \n \n3. \nGeneration  tariff  calculations  were  based  on  current  NEPRA  norms.  Generation  tariffs \nfor  the  projected  years  for  new  projects  were  adjusted  to  cover  capital  costs,  operation  and \nmaintenance, depreciation, and debt service while allowing 15% return on equity. For assessing \neach company\u2019s financial viability, weighted average generation tariffs were calculated based on \nNEPRA principles and assumed to increase at a measurable rate. Operating expenses consist \nof repairs and maintenance, salaries and wages, administrative costs, and depreciation. Costs \nfor repairing and maintaining generation assets were assumed to be 4% of gross fixed assets \nand decline over time. Depreciation was calculated on a straight-line basis at 3% in line with the \ninternational standard. More details are in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n                                                 \n1  Consumer price index is estimated at 7.6% for 2007, 7.4% for 2008, 7.2% for 2009, 7.0% for 2010 and onwards. \n2  The manufacturer\u2019s unit value index is 1.9% for 2007\u20132009 and 2.0% onwards. \n3  This  excludes  ADB-assisted  projects.  Four  ongoing  projects  (Malakand  III,  Shishi,  Rashun,  and  Pehur)  under \nimplementation by SHYDO total $126 million and the feasibility studies of seven projects (486 MW) amounting to \n$627 million have been completed.   \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTable A11.1: Shydo Proforma Statements\n                       (PRs

price  levels.  The \n1. \ndomestic price numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at their border price equivalent \nvalues and were converted to domestic equivalents using an estimated standard exchange rate \nfactor  of  1.11.  Capital  costs  included  physical  contingencies  but  excluded  taxes,  price \ncontingencies, and financial charges during construction. The official exchange rate as of June \n2006 has been taken as PRs60 = $1. A variable cost (excluding staff costs) of PRs0.0001/kWh \nand  a  fixed cost  of  3% of  capital  cost  were  assumed.  A  plant  overhaul  costing  20%  of  capital \ncost after 10 years was also assumed. Station use of 0.5% of gross generation, and peak and \noff-peak transmission losses of 2% and 1% of gross generation respectively, were assumed, as \nwere peak and off-peak technical distribution losses of 15% and 8%, respectively. An oil price of \n$40 per barrel (bbl) has been used as a base case for economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \ncalculations, and sensitivities tested higher bound oil prices of $35/bbl and $50/bbl.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nFor  the  purposes  of  establishing  that  the  subprojects  were  least  cost,  the  National \nTransmission  and  Dispatch  Company  (NTDC)  was  requested  to  undertake  the  specific  Wien \nAutomatic  System  Planning  (WASP)  runs.  The  WASP  IV  program  is  the  primary  means  by \nwhich  NTDC  undertakes  least-cost  planning  for  electricity  generation.  NTDC\u2019s  energy  and \ndemand forecast for supply from the national grid for 2010, 2015, and 2020 are 17.4, 26.8, and \n38.0  thousand  MW,  respectively.  Demand-supply  analysis  based  upon  the  medium-term \nforecast shows that the NTDC system will have capacity shortfalls in 2006, 2008, and 2010 of \n400, 1,200 and 5,138 MW, respectively. Capacity includes all ongoing and committed projects. \nThe least-cost expansion plan included all types of candidate plants, covering (i) hydroelectric \nplants for which feasibility studies are underway or are planned, (ii) coal-fired plants using local \ncoal, (iii) base load combined cycle plants fired by imported and domestic gas, (iv) open cycle \ngas  turbines  fired  by  local  and  imported  gas,  and  (v)  other  plants.  More  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix L.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  subprojects  produce  both  incremental  and  nonincremental  outputs.  Incremental \noutput  was  valued  using  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  (WTP).  Nonincremental  output  was \nvalued using the estimated long-run marginal costs (LRMCs) of peak and off-peak energy. The \nstatus  of  the  high-head  subprojects  as  peaking  stations  means  that  nearly  100%  of  output \nduring  the  four-hour  peak  period  can  be  deemed  incremental.  For  low-head  subprojects,  the \nsplit between incremental and non incremental output was estimated using a with- and without- \nsubprojects analysis in WASP IV, resulting in approximately 50% of output during the four-hour \npeak  period  being  deemed  incremental.  LRMC  derived  on  the  basis  of  thermal  equivalent \nprovides  a  static  simplification  of  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  power  system,  as  it  assumes  that \nthe marginal plant is constant and that the plant factor of the proposed project is constant. To \navoid  this  simplification,  peak  energy  and  off-peak  energy  LRMCs  for  the  without-subprojects \ncase  were  determined  at  the  grid  level  using  WASP  IV  and  were  adjusted  as  appropriate  to \nreflect  the  voltage  level  at  which  benefits  would  be  delivered.  The  economic  benefits  of  the \nsubprojects have thus been estimated as (i) incremental output valued at consumers\u2019 estimated \nWTP, (ii) nonincremental peak-period output (assumed to be 4 hours/day) valued at the LRMC \nof peak energy at the appropriate or applicable voltage level, and (iii) nonincremental off-peak-\n\nCalculation of Willingness to Pay (WTP) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nperiod  output  (assumed  to  be  20  hours/day)  valued  at  the  LRMC  of  off-peak  energy  at  the \nappropriate voltage level.  \n \n4. \nWTP  was  estimated  by  comparing  current  electricity  prices  against  the  price  of  the \nalternative  source  of  energy  for  each  of  four  consumer  classes  (residential,  agricultural, \ncommercial, and industrial), and by assuming that consumers will be willing to pay a proportion \nof the difference between what they would be required to pay for an alternative energy source \nand what they would actually pay for the additional units of energy delivered by the subprojects. \nResidential  consumers  typically  use  kerosene  lamps  for  reserve  lighting  when  grid-supplied \nelectricity is unavailable (constrained off), as they represent the next best viable alternative from \nan  economic  perspective.  The  economic  lifecycle  cost  of  kerosene  lamps  is  approximately \nPRs28/kWh. \n \n5. \nIn  the  commercial,  industrial,  and  agricultural  sectors,  diesel  generators  are  typically \nemployed to provide backup electricity when grid-supplied electricity is unavailable or when the \nvoltage  is  too  low  for  proper  operation  of  electrical  equipment.  Thus,  diesel  generators  were \nused  as  the  next  best  alternative  at  an  estimated  lifecycle  cost  of  PRs14/kWh.  Incremental \nconsumption is expected to accrue partially as a consequence of improved availability releasing \nsuppressed  demand  and  partially  as  a  consequence  of  improved  supply  quality.  This \ncomplicates estimation of WTP for incremental consumption of residential consumers. In lieu of \ndetailed household energy use data, and particularly in relation to the impact of supply quality \non  demand,  it  has  been  conservatively  assumed  that,  for  residential  consumers,  33%  of  the \ndifference between tariff and alternative energy sources represents consumer surplus. For other \nconsumer  classes,  a  linear  demand  function  has  been  assumed,  with  50%  of  the  difference \nbetween the marginal tariff and alternative energy cost representing consumer surplus. \n \nD. \n \nEconomic  costs  exclude  taxes,  price  contingencies,  and  financial  charges  during \n6. \nconstruction.  The  main  benefit  of  the  subprojects  is  electricity  generation  to  meet  electricity \ndemand  (incremental  output)  and  to  displace  more  expensive  thermal  plant  (non  incremental \noutput). Incremental output was valued using consumers\u2019 estimated willingness to pay (WTP). \nNon  incremental  output  was  valued  using  the  estimated  long-run  marginal  costs  (LRMCs)  of \npeak  and  off-peak  energy.  The  split  between  incremental  and  nonincremental  output  for  low-\nhead  schemes  was  estimated  using  a  with-  and  without-  subprojects  analysis  in  WASP  IV, \nresulting  in  approximately  50%  of  output  during  the  four-hour  peak  period  being  deemed \nincremental. For high-head schemes, their status as peaking plants means that 100% of output \nduring the four-hour peak period being can be deemed incremental. On the basis of estimated \ncosts of alternative energy sources and average marginal tariffs for each consumer sector, the \nWTPs  for  incremental  consumption  were  estimated  as  (i)  residential:  PRs13.65/kWh,  (ii) \nagricultural:  PRs8.2/kWh  (NWFP)  and  PRs8.4/kWh  (Punjab),  (iii)  commercial:  PRs10.5/kWh, \nand (iv) industrial: PRs9.0/kWh. Weighted WTPs of PRs12.17/kWh (NWFP) and PRs12.19/kWh \n(Punjab) were thus used as the unit value for incremental output.  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nThe  basis  for  evaluation  is  a  comparison  of  benefits  and  costs  between  the  with-  and \nwithout-subprojects  cases.  The  analysis  period  is  25  years,  including  4  years  for  developing \nlow-head  schemes  and  5  years  for  high-head  schemes.  The  three  proposed  subprojects  in \nNWFP have EIRRs ranging from 14.8% to 21.6%. The five subprojects in Punjab have EIRRs \nranging from 17.1% to 23.2%. The total benefits estimated in this analysis can be interpreted as \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nEstimation of Costs and Benefit \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nconservative  estimates.  There  are  large  environmental  benefits  from  avoided  pollution  from \ntraditional alternative energy sources.  \n \n8. \nSensitivity  analysis  showed  that  projects  are  independently  and  collectively  resilient  to \nnegative  changes  in  key  assumptions  and  variables.  Tables  A12.1  and  A12.2  summarize  the \nsensitivities of EIRR to changes in key variables for the combined NWFP and Punjab schemes, \nrespectively. No case found less than 12% EIRR in sensitivity analysis including a combination \nof  10%  reduction  of  benefits,  10%  increase  in  cost,  and  1-year  delay.  The  estimated  EIRR  is \ngreater  than  12%,  which  is  the  standard  cutoff  rate.  Distribution  analysis  was  undertaken  to \ndetermine  the  distribution  of  project  benefits.  Consumers  will  gain  by  PRs480  million  and \nPRs600  million  from  the  NWFP  and  Punjab  components,  respectively,  as  a  consequence  of \nconsumer surplus on incremental consumption.

The Implementing \nAgency (IA) for five of the subprojects located in Punjab is the Irrigation and Power Department \n(IPD),  whereas  the  Sarhad  Hydel  Development  Organization  (SHYDO)  is  the  IA  for  the  three \ncore subprojects located in NWFP. All subprojects are classified as Category B in accordance \nwith  Asian Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines.  The  environmental  assessment  requirements \nof the Government are identical to those of ADB for hydropower projects of less than 50 MW. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  is  required  to  be  submitted  to  the  relevant \nenvironmental protection authority, the Punjab Environmental Protection Department in Punjab \nor  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  Environmental  Protection  Agency  in  NWFP.  The \nIEEs  and  this  summary  IEE  for  the  eight  subprojects  have  been  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  policy  and  guidelines 2  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nregulations. The environmental framework is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nB. \n \n2. \nPunjab Province: Punjab forms part of Indus Basin Watershed System. The landscape \nof the whole province has been changed completely by development in the last 100 years of the \nlargest canal  system  in the  world.  The  subprojects  are  located  in  plain areas  with elevation  in \nthe  range  of  50\u2013150  m above  mean  sea  level.  The  subproject  areas  fall  in  a  moist  temperate \nzone that receives rains in the summer monsoon. Some residual precipitation is also received in \nthe winter months due to western Mediterranean winds. The lowest and highest values of mean \nmonthly  maximum  temperature  are  about  5\u00b0  C  and  42\u00b0  C  during  the  months  of  January  and \nJune, respectively. The soils of the subproject areas are characterized as alluvium deposits of \nsandy loam and sandy silt. According to the Seismo-Tectonic Map of Pakistan, the subproject \narea  belongs  to  one  of  the  least  active  earthquake  zones  in  the  country,  rated  Zone  0.  The \ncanals deliver an almost uniform irrigation water flow for 11 months of the year. The people of \nthe subproject areas depend upon the canals to meet their household water needs.  \n \nBecause  of  extensive  cultivation,  high  population,  and  human  activities,  there  is  little \n3. \nwildlife  in  the  subproject  areas.  There  are  no  protected  areas  close  to  any  of  the  subproject \nareas.  There  are  no  natural  forests  in  the  vicinity  of  the  subproject  areas.  However,  the  trees \nalong  canals  planted  by  irrigation  and  power  departments  and  forestry  departments  fall  in  the \ncategory  of  reserved  forests.  Local  farmers  are  practicing  a  small  degree  of  farm-forestry  to \nmeet  their  fuel  wood  and  other  day-to-day  needs.  Ever  since  the  irrigation  canal  system  was \ndeveloped,  cotton,  rice,  sugarcane  and  wheat  have  been  the  main  crops.  More  recently, \nhowever, cotton and sugar cane cultivation has been replaced by maize and potatoes in many \nareas. The fisheries department reports that the main fish species found in the canal system are \nGulfam,  Rahoo,  and  Mohri.  Because  of  the  construction  of  several  barrages  on  the  river \nnetwork, migratory species have almost become extinct in Punjab waters.  \n \nThe  subproject  areas  have  a  reasonably  well-developed  communication  infrastructure \n4. \nlinked to the irrigation and farming network. At the highest level are the National Highway N-5 \nand other highways such as Gujranwala-Sialkot road. Other cities and towns are connected to \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

In  many  areas,  small  farm-to-market  roads  also  provide \nreasonable  means  of  communication.  The  distance,  size,  and  socioeconomic  status  of  the \nclosest villages to the subproject sites have been described in detail in the IEE.  \n \n5. \nNorth-West Frontier Province: The general project area of Daral Khwar and Ranolia is \ncharacterized  by  diverse  ground  topography  with  sparsely  projecting  rugged  rocky  outcrops, \nlush  green  cultivated  plains  with  some  barren  land  and  gently  rolling  undulations,  all  having  a \nrich  biodiversity.  There  are  no  protected  areas  located  within  close  vicinity  of  the  subprojects. \nThe  subproject  areas  fall  almost  at  the  northern  edge  of  the  area  affected  by  summer \nmonsoons; hence, it only receives residual rains with sparse distribution. Maximum precipitation \nis in the form of winter snow, which is brought by western Mediterranean winds. Annual mean \nprecipitation  is  about  1,560  mm  in  Swat  and  1,700 mm  in  Ranolia.  In  June  and  July,  midday \ntemperatures may rise to 40\u00b0 C in Swat and 30\u00b0 C in Ranolia. December and January are the \ncoldest months, during which average daily temperatures may drop to below freezing. \n \n6. \nSoils of the subproject areas are mostly a mixture of varying degrees of alluvial deposits, \nwhere sizeable concentrations of organic matter are found in bowl-shaped valley depressions. \nSuch  places  are  used  for  agriculture,  where  terraced  fields  are  found  on  the  steep  mountain \nslopes.  The  project  area  has  abundant  water  resources.  In  the  last  10  years,  local  level \nelectricity generation units have also been installed on these water sources. The region also has \nmany  fresh  water  springs,  which  are  tapped  by  the  residents  to  meet  domestic  water \nrequirements.  According  to  the  Seismo-Tectonic  Map  of  Pakistan,  a  sizeable  part  of  Swat \nKohistan belongs to one of the major earthquake zones, where in the recent past earthquakes \nup to a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale have been observed. According to the Structural \nGeology  and  Tectonics  map,  the  main  earthquake  centers  fall  within  a  circle  of  50  km  radius \naround Madyan. The Daral Khawar and Ranolia area is in a relatively calm zone.  \n \n7. \nThe  common  mammals  reported  from  the  Daral  Khawar  and  Ranolia  areas  and  their \nadjoining valleys are monkeys, markhor, musk deer, black bear, brown bear, wolf, leopard cat, \nand panther. Besides common birds, some significant species of the project area are Himalayan \nchakor,  snow  cock,  koklas  pheasant,  and  snow  partridge.  There  are  a  variety  of  highly \nendangered  and  rare  pheasants  in  the  Kohistan  area,  including  monal,  white  crested  Khalij, \nsnow cock, Koklas, snow partridge, and the most endangered western tragopan. Snow leopard, \nbrown  bear,  musk  deer  and  snow  partridge  have  declining  population  and  are  classified  as \nendangered species. In the immediate Ranolia site area there is degraded habitat and no threat \nexists to any rare or endangered species. Forests in the entire Swat and Kohistan area fall into \nthe  protected  category.  The  subproject  areas  have  high  hill  coniferous  forests,  which  are \nassociated with the dry-temperate climate zone. Very limited data is available for fish species in \nthe Swat River system, and almost none for Daral Khwar, which is a tributary of the same. The \nfish  species  known  as  Swati  (Schizothorax  plagiostomas)  is  found  in  most  rivers  of  NWFP. \nBrown trout have been introduced to Swat River, where, in certain streams they have done well. \nThe socioeconomic status of the project area has been described in detail in the IEE.  \n \nC. \n \nThe subprojects will provide electric power to the wider population. The subprojects will \n8. \nprovide  unskilled  jobs  during  the  construction  phase  and  a  limited  number  of  jobs  during \noperations. Hydropower is a clean and renewable source of energy and avoids contributing to \nthe  pollution  loads  that  would  result  from  the  alternative  use  of  thermal  electricity  generation. \nThe subprojects will result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, with potential for carbon credit \ntransactions.  In  addition  to  the  trees  on  private  land  that  will  be  affected  by  the  subprojects, \ntrees in the rights-of-way of the canals and on government land would be lost due to clearing of \nland required for the construction work. To compensate for this, tree planting will be undertaken \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n65 \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan and Institutional Requirements \n\nin all eight subprojects. Provisions have been made to plant more than 200,000 trees over 19 ha \nin  the  subprojects.  Construction  activities  on  the  subprojects  are  likely  to  have  short-term \nadverse  impacts.  To  mitigate  the  impacts,  environmental  controls  have  been  proposed  in  the \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs) included in the IEEs.  \n \nIn the absence of specific Pakistan guidelines for the amount of water (residual water) to \n9. \nbe retained in a watercourse when water is extracted for hydropower purposes, the standards \nused in Western Europe (e.g., Switzerland) were used. The minimum residual water flow to be \nleft  in  Daral  Khwar  and  Ranolia  Rivers  as  determined  by  this  standard  (and  rounded  up  to \nnearest  multiple  of  100)  is  700  liters/second  and  500  liters/second,  respectively.  Water \nmonitoring quality programs are proposed to assess impacts of reduced water flows in the two \nrivers and impacts upon water users. The powerhouses constructed in the low-head subprojects \nwill be connected to the national grid by 11-kV transmission lines to the nearest grid station. The \nmaximum length of these lines is 20 km. The lines will be installed in the existing rights-of-way \nof  the  canals,  and  therefore  no  land  acquisition  is  envisaged.  The  Ranolia  and  Daral  Khwar \npowerhouses will be connected to the national grid by 36 km of 33-kV transmission line and 12 \nkm  of  66-kV  transmission  line,  respectively.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  lines  will  follow  the \nexisting  road  and  will  be  constructed  within  the  existing  road  right-of-way.  Where  this  is  not \npossible, land will be acquired for which provisions are available in the budget. The transmission \nlines will not pass through any protected area, or other environmentally sensitive areas. \n \nD \n \n10. \nThe IAs will obtain approvals for their IEEs from the respective environmental protection \nagencies. The IAs will also monitor their respective subprojects and forward monitoring reports \non  a  regular  basis  to  the  provincial  environmental  protection  agencies  as  per  the  regulatory \nrequirements.  The  IA  will  ensure  that  environmental  conditions  are  included  in  project \nconstruction contract documents. To handle their general environmental and land compensation \nresponsibilities,  the  IAs  will  develop  the  capacity  and  allocate  human  resources  to  implement \nthe  EMP  and  Resettlement  Plan.  Part  C  of  the  investment  program  covers  a  major  capacity \ndevelopment effort. The IAs will also appoint an environment and resettlement officer. Terms of \nreference for this position are included in the IEE. \n \nA detailed mitigation plan was prepared as part of the EMP. The mitigation plan contains \n11. \na  comprehensive  listing  of  mitigation  actions,  the  persons  responsible  for  ensuring  full \nimplementation  of  each  action,  the  persons  responsible  for  monitoring  the  action,  and  a  time \nscale for  implementation  of  the  action  to  ensure  that  the  objectives  of mitigation  are  fully  met. \nThe  mitigation  measures  will  be  translated  into  environmental  requirements  and  specifications \nfor detailed design and construction and will be legally binding. Two types of monitoring will be \nconducted: compliance monitoring and impact or effect monitoring. Compliance monitoring will \nbe  the  responsibility  of  the  IA  and  all  other  organizations  involved  in  the  field  activities.  The \neffects monitoring will be carried out in line with the requirements in the mitigation plan, focusing \non fish and water quality impacts. The total cost of the environmental mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures for the eight subprojects is about PRs62.1 million ($1.03 million). \n \nE. \n \n12. \nThe  subprojects  will  have  very  little  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  adverse \nimpacts  will  be  adequately  mitigated  as  described  in  the  EMP,  which  IAs  are  committed  to \nimplement.  However,  IAs  will  obtain  maximum  benefits  from  the  capacity  development \ncomponent of the investment program. The IAs will improve their capacities to implement and \nmonitor  the  measures  in  the  EMP.  Based  on  the  review  conducted  to  date,  ADB  environment \ncategory B is appropriate and a full environmental impact assessment is not necessary. \n\nConclusions \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN OF RANOLIA HYDROPOWER PLANT \n\nIntroduction \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  and \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Ranoia  Hydropower  Plant  (Rhydropower  plant)  subproject  is  situated  on  a  natural \n1. \nmountain  stream,  known  as  Ranolia  Khwar,  which  gets  its  water  from  perennial  springs  and \nmelting  snow.  About  6.0  ha  of  privately  owned  forest  and  agricultural  land  will  need  to  be \nacquired permanently from individual landowners for construction of this power plant. A 33-kV \ntransmission  line  will  be  constructed  along  Karakorum  Highway  to  Besham  (20  km)  within  its \nright-of-way, for which no land acquisition will be necessary. An additional 0.15 ha land has to \nbe  acquired  temporarily  by  the  contractor  for  establishing  a  construction  camp  and  storage  of \nequipment and material. A total of 24 households will be affected, two of which significantly. As \na result of the consultations, the design of the proposed weir was changed to ensure a minimum \nof 500 litres/second of residual water flow into the Ranolia Khwar even during the winter.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nincluding  North- \nWest Frontier Province, use the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (LAA), with amendments, as the \ncore  legal  document  for  acquiring  private  land  for  public  purposes.  The  process  of  land \nacquisition is initiated by serving a preliminary notice under Section 4 of the Act by the District \nRevenue  Officer  (DRO),  acting  as  the  land  acquisition  collector  (LAC),  expressing  the \nGovernment\u2019s intention to \"enter upon\" the identified private lands for surveying and soil-testing \nfor a specified public purpose. The next activity is carried out under Section 5, which involves \nmarking  and  measuring  the  land  and  assessing  compensation.  The  final  declaration  for \npossession of the selected portions or strips of land is issued under Section 6 of the LAA. \n \n3. \nUnder  the  LAA,  only  persons  officially  registered  as  owners  with  the  Land  Revenue \nDepartment  or  who  possess  formal  lease  agreements  are  considered  eligible  for  land \ncompensation. As per the provisions of the Act, cash compensation is assessed (Section 5) on \nthe basis of average registered land sale transfer rates for the latest 3\u20135 years and is paid to the \nlandowners  for  their  lands  being  acquired.1 However,  there  have  been  instances  in  the  near \npast  of  taking  average  rates  of  the  past  1  year,  and  even  taking  the  current  rates.  For  land \nacquisition for this project, nevertheless, the current open-market rates or replacement value will \nbe  applied,  as  per  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  policy,  and  the  process  of  land  acquisition  will  be \nshortened  by  replacing  formal  LAA  mechanisms  with  direct  negotiations  with  the  landowners \nand their village elders. In the absence of a formal policy, a project-specific set of resettlement \nprinciples  consistent  with  ADB  resettlement  policy 2 requirements  has  been  adopted  for  this \nADB-funded project.  \n\nfour  provinces, \n\nthe \n\nTable A14.1: Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nEntitlement \n\nDetails  \n\nType of Losses \n\nA.

A  resettlement  information  leaflet  containing  information  on \ncompensation and resettlement options was made available in local languages and distributed \nto  affected  persons.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  through  Environmental  and  Social \nDevelopment  Cell  (ESDC)  and  the  PMUs  has  conduct  consultations  in  affected  villages  to \nexplain the resettlement plan in coordination with village and community leaders. Each affected \nperson  will  be  provided  information  regarding  specific  entitlements.  Disputes  on  entitlements \ncan  be  forwarded  to  the  project  implementation  unit  for  appropriate  action.  The  summary \nresettlement plan (RP) will be disclosed on the ADB website, and information dissemination and \nconsultation will continue throughout the project implementation period. \n \n5. \nA  grievance  redress  committee  (GRC)  will  be  formed  to  ensure  affected  persons\u2019 \ngrievances are addressed and appropriated actions are taken to resolve them. The committee \nmembers of a GRC will include affected person representatives, and especially representatives \nof  vulnerable  affected  persons,  local-level  IA/PMU  staff,  local  governments,  respected  citizens \nin diverse professions, non government organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, \nand local civil and interest groups. The head of a locally elected body will head the GRC. The \nGRC  will  meet  every  2  weeks  especially  during  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  phase. \nAfter  that,  it  will  meet  as  and  when  grievances  are  referred  to  it  to  redress.  The  main \nresponsibilities of the GRC are to (i) help APs\u2019 in resolving issues arising from land and property \nacquisition  processes;  (ii)  record,  categorize,  prioritize,  and  resolve  APs\u2019  grievances;  (iii) \nimmediately inform the PMU of serious issues and problems; and (iv) inform affected persons of \nthe decisions of the GRC and PMU. Each GRC will review grievances involving all resettlement \nbenefits,  compensation,  relocation,  and  other  assistance.  Detailed  investigation  will  be \nundertaken  which  may  involve  field  investigation  with  the  affected  persons  concerned. \nGrievances  will  be  redressed  within  2\u20133  weeks  from  the  dates  of  lodging  the  complaints.  The \nGRC will continue to function during the life of the project, including the defects liability period.  \n \nD. \n \nAll  affected  persons  will  be  provided  with  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  if \n6. \ntheir  lands  are  permanently  or  temporarily  acquired,  their  income  sources  are  adversely \naffected, their homes are fully or partially affected, and such other properties as commercial or \nagricultural structures, crops, trees, and other facilities or access to properties are damaged or \nreduced due to subprojects. Lack of legal documents of their customary rights of occupancy or \ntitles shall not affect their eligibility for compensation. In case of land acquisition where land-for-\nland  is  not  a  feasible  option,  the  RP  stipulates  payment  of  compensation  based  on  assessed \nreplacement or market value of land and structures to affected persons. Temporary land losers \nwill be in charge of land clearance and will be therefore compensated for the provision of labor \nat the minimum agricultural wage rate for the duration of this activity.  \n \n7. \nIn addition to compensation payments in accordance with the LAA, affected persons will \nreceive  additional  assistance  to  match  replacement  costs  (the  difference  between  the \nreplacement  value  and  the  assessed  value)  for  lost  land  and  structures;  transaction  costs \nincluding but not limited to stamps and registration costs for the purchase of replacement land; \nand  other  forms  of  resettlement  assistance  such  as  transition  and  shifting  allowances,  and \nagricultural inputs for re-establishing crops. Losses of profits and income due to property loss or \nloss of access to property, regardless of whether the affected person is titled or non-titled, will \nbe compensated. To restore income losses, there will be compensation for lost workdays and/or \n\nCompensation and Income Restoration \n\n\fAppendix 14   \n\n69 \n\nInstitutional Framework, Resettlement Costs, and Implementation Schedule \n\nincome.  Eligible  affected  persons,  both  titled  and  non-titled,  will  be  provided  rental  income  for \ntemporary  acquisition.  Loss  of  structures  shall  be  compensated  according  to  the  provisions \nincluded  in  the  entitlements  matrix.  Restoration  for  any  disruption  occurred  during  the \nimplementation on temporarily acquired land shall be undertaken by the contractor. \n \nE. \n \n8. \nA  PMU  will  be  established  in  Sarhad  Hydel  Development  Organization  (SHYDO) \nheadquarters  in  Peshawar.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \npoject.  Each  IAs  will  create  its  respective  administrative  unit,  the  ESDC,  consisting  of  two \nmembers:  an  environmental  specialist  and  a  resettlement  specialist.3 The  ESDC  will  work  in \nclose cooperation with the respective field-based office on the day-to-day activities of the Short \nResettlement Plan implementation. At present SHYDO does not fully possess the expertise and \nexperience  required  for  implementing  the  RP  and  verifying  and  revising  the  data  on  affected \nlands and assets presented herein after the revision and finalization of the project design. The \nPMU  through  ESDC  field  offices,  district  land  acquisition  collector  (LAC/DRO),  and  the \nResettlement  Specialist  will  monitor  the  progress  of  the  work.  That  specialist  will  ensure \ncoordination between the relevant departments, the grievance redress committee and the APs.  \n \n\nTable A14.2: Resettlement Costs \n \nUnit \n\nQuantity \n\nDescription \n\nItem \n\nNo. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLand Acquisition - Forest/Pasture \n\nLand Acquisition - Farmlands \n\nTemporary Land Acquisition (3 years) \n\nCompensation for Affected Houses \n\nCompensation for Affected Trees \n\nSubtotal Compensations  \n\nResettlement Specialist (Package) \n\nResettlement Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nha \n\nha \n\nha \n\nno. \n\nno. \n\npm \n\npm \n\n5.532 \n\n0.685 \n\n0.150 \n\n2 \n\n312 \n\n12 \n\n4 \n\nTraining, Information Brochure, and Consultation Meetings \n\nSubtotal Resettlement Expertise \n\nTotal Costs \n\n9 \n\nContingencies (15%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOverall Resettlement Costs  \n\nMean Rate \n\nEstimated Amount \n\n(PRs/Unit) \n\nPRs. \n\n$ \n\n2,127,500 \n\n11.769,330 \n\n196,156 \n\n5,175,000 \n\n3,544,875 \n\n59,081 \n\n600,000 \n\n90,000 \n\n1,500 \n\n1,377,500 \n\n2,755,000 \n\n45,917 \n\n573 \n\n178,800 \n\n2,980 \n\n150,000 \n\n200,000 \n\n18,338,005 \n\n305,633 \n\n1,800,000 \n\n30,000 \n\n800,000 \n\n13,333 \n\n300,000 \n\n5,000 \n\n2,900,000 \n\n48,333 \n\n21,238,005 \n\n353,967 \n\n3,185,701 \n\n53,095 \n\n24,423,706 \n\n407,062 \n\nha = hectare, no. = number pm = person months. \nSources: Irrigation and Power Departments (I&PD); North-West Frontier Province (NWFP); Punjab Province; ADB estimates. \n\n \nTable A14.3: Implementation Schedule and Responsibilities \n \n\nResettlement Planning Activity \n\nResponsibility \n\nYear 0 \n\nYear 1 \n\nYear 2 \n\nYear 3 \n\nNo. \n\nDescription \n\nPrimary   Secondary Pre-Project  1\n\n3  4  1  2  3  4\n\n1  Stakeholder Consultations \n\n2  RP Disclosure - Brochure in Urdu \n\nESDC \n\nESDC \n\n3  RP Revision and Disclosure (if needed) \n\nESDC \n\n4  Preparations for RP Implementation \n\nESDC \n\nRS \n\nRS \n\nRS \n\nRS \n\n5  Site Demarcation of Affected Lands \n\nSHYDO \n\nESDC \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n                                                 \n3 The terms of reference for these officers are in Annex 3. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n1\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n3\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n4\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n6  Relocation of Affected Houses \n\nSHYDO \n\nESDC \n\n7  Request to LAC for Initiating Process \n\n8  Request to DFO for Tree Inventory \n\nSHYDO \n\nSHYDO \n\nIPD \n\nIPD \n\n9  Survey and Design of Ranolia Road \n\nSHYDO \n\nFWD \n\n10 \n\nInventory-Taking of Lands, Trees, etc.  \n\nLAC/FWD \n\nESDC/RS \n\n11  Compensation Assessment (revised) \n\nLAC/FWD \n\nESDC/RS \n\n12  Payment of Compensation  \n\n13  Grievance Redress / Revision of RP \n\n14  Possession of Land for Project Works \n\nLAC \n\nGRC \n\nLAC \n\nESDC/RS \n\nESDC/RS \n\nSHYDO \n\n15  Temporary Acquisition of Land \n\nContractor  Community \n\n16  Cutting or Removal of Affected Trees \n\nFWD \n\nAPs \n\n17  Construction and Installation Works \n\nContractor  Consultant \n\n18  Return of Temporarily Acquired Land \n\nContractor  Community \n\n19  External RP Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\nEMS \n\nESDC/RS \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nSharp Deadline     \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nAP = affected persons.

The  ESDC  internal  monitoring  will  include  (i)  administrative  monitoring  (planning, \nimplementation,  feedback  and  troubleshooting,  AP\u2019s  file  maintenance,  and  preparation  of \nprogress  reports),  (ii)  socioeconomic  monitoring  (case  studies,  development  of  baseline \ninformation  on  APs\u2019  socioeconomic  conditions,  compensation  payment,  grievance  resolution, \nrelocation, payment of other entitlements etc), and (iii) impact evaluation monitoring (calculation \nof compensation payment rates, quality of resettlement sites if any, consultation programs, and \nrestoration  and  improvement  of  income  standards  and  livelihoods  against  established \nbenchmarks).  Monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  documenting  progress  on  resettlement \nimplementation and RP completion reports will be provided by ESDC to ADB for review.  \n \n10. \nThe EA will engage the services of an independent agency not associated with project \nimplementation to undertake external monitoring and evaluation of resettlement implementation. \nThe  external  monitoring  agency  will  have  experience  in  resettlement  implementation  and  a \nsatisfactory  familiarity  with  lands  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \npolicy.  It  will  be  hired  in  consultation  with  ADB  within  3  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness.  The \nagency will monitor and verify RP implementation to determine whether resettlement goals have \nbeen  achieved  and  livelihood  and  living  standards  have  been  restored  or  improved.  It  will \nhighlight  weaknesses  in  the  implementation  process  with  recommendations  on  how  to \novercome  them.  The  external  monitoring  of  the  project  will  be  done  twice  a  year  and  impact \nevaluation  during  the  midterm  review  of  resettlement  implementation  and  at  the  end  of  the \nsubproject. Monitoring will indicate whether affected persons understood their entitlements and \ntheir views on resettlement site conditions.
