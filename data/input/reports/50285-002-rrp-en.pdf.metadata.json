\n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL) and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Local Health Care for Disadvantaged Areas Sector Development Program.1 \n\n2. \nThe  program  is  part  of  a  coordinated  effort  to  assist  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam \nachieve  universal  health  coverage  (UHC),  including  access  to  essential  health  care  services. \nThe  program  is  fully  aligned  with  (i)  the  government\u2019s  local  health  care  (LHC)  system2 reform \nagenda,  and  (ii)  the  Master  Plan  on  Building  and  Developing  of  the  LHC  Network  in  New \nSituation. 3  The  program  complements  the  proposed  Second  Health  Human  Resources \nDevelopment  Project,  which  will  boost  the  quality  and  quantity  of  health  care  professionals \noverall, and provide systematic solutions to build the capacity of health professionals working in \nrural  underserved  areas.  The  PBL  will  support  reforms  to  strengthen  key  areas  in  the  LHC \nsystem,  and  improve  health  service  delivery,  and  the  quality  of  the  LHC  workforce.  The  grant \nwill fund the critical investment gaps necessary to translate these reforms into tangible results. \nThese investments will ensure access to quality health services and health security in remote, \ndisadvantaged,  and  border  areas  with  a  strong  focus  on  the  health  needs  of  women.  Policy \nreforms will have nationwide impact while the grant will focus on areas with high poverty levels. \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nDevelopment  context.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  has  bolstered  the \n3. \ncountry\u2019s  progress  in reducing  poverty. Gross  domestic  product  (GDP) grew  by  an  average  of \n6.5%  per  year  from  1991  to  2017.  GDP  per  capita  reached  $2,389  in  2017.  The  poverty  rate \n(i.e.,  the  share  of  the  population  living  on  less  than  $1.90  per  day  in  2011  purchasing  power \nparity) fell from 52.9% in 1992 to 2.0% in 2016, while the Gini coefficient decreased slightly from \n35.7 to 35.3 over the same period.4 Poverty incidence varies significantly across regions. Ethnic \nminorities, who account for 14.5% of the population, make up more than half of the poor. 5 The \ngovernment  has  recognized  that  inclusive  growth  and  public  health  are  intricately  linked,  as \nshown  by  disparities  in  key  health  indicators  by  region.  For  example,  in  the  impoverished \nCentral  Highlands,  infant mortality  rate  was  24.8/1,000  live  births  in  2015,  while in  the  affluent \nSouth East region,6 it was 8.6/1,000 live births. Similar variations are also found in reproductive \nhealth and maternal mortality outcomes. 7  \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  local  health  care  system  is  intended  to  serve  as  the  first  point  of  contact  between  health  services  and  the \npopulation. It encompasses the network of (i) commune health stations, (ii) district health centers providing public \nhealth and preventive services, and (iii) district hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient curative services. \n\n3  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  MOH.

Joint  Annual  Health  Review  2016:  Towards  Healthy \n\nSustainable Growth. Manila. \n\nAging in Viet Nam. \n\n7  For example, in 2016 the national maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 58 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. \nIn  comparison,  the  MMR  in  Dien  Bien  province  (63  maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births)  and  in  Lai  Chau \nprovince (85 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) were very high. \n\n \n\n\f \n4. \nInequitable access to quality and affordable healthcare services worsens the disparities \nin health outcomes and perpetuates income inequality. Inclusive growth is further threatened by \nthe  growing  financial  burden  associated  with  the  treatment  of  non-communicable  diseases \n(NCD).8  In 2015, the proportion of total disease burden attributable to NCD reached 73%, partly \ndue  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  aging  population.9 Catastrophic  health  expenditure  is  more  likely  to  occur \namong  households  with  NCD  patients.10 Epidemic  prone  diseases  can  also  have  a  significant \nimpact  on  health and  livelihoods,  and pose  a further risk  to  inclusive  growth,  as evidenced  by \nthe  economic  damage  caused  by  the  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  and  avian  flu \nepidemics.11 \n \n5. \nThe LHC system plays a central role in mitigating health-related barriers to sustainable \ninclusive  growth.  In  Viet  Nam,  a  strong  LHC  system,  consisting  primarily  of  commune  health \nstations (CHS) is critical to ensuring equitable access to health care, especially for low-income \nand ethnic minority populations. It provides the foundation for effective long-term management \nof  NCDs,  as  well  as  early  detection  of  and  timely  response  to  health  security  threats.12 Local \ngovernments manage LHC investments, including budgets allocated by the central government. \nHealth  insurance  reimbursements  finance  recurrent  costs  for  LHC,  including  salaries  and \nequipment operation and maintenance. CHS provide various services: preventive health, basic \ncurative,  obstetric,  pediatric  care,  and  inpatient  treatment.13 Recognizing  the  important  role  of \nCHS,  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  is  setting  policies  and standards,  including  frameworks  for \nCHS financing. \n \n6. \nHowever,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  LHC  system  has  been  unable  to  deliver  health  care  services \nadequately,  and  many  CHS  are  considered  substandard.  Years  of  underinvestment  in  lower \nlevel facilities have perpetuated poor service delivery.  In 2015, only 66.1% of CHS nationwide \nmet  national  service  standards.  The  Northern  midlands  and  mountain  region,  which  achieved \nonly  44.6%  of  standards,  was  the  worst-performing  region.  Out  of  11,000  CHS  nationwide, \nabout 1,192 require reconstruction and  1,239 require major renovation. Over 5,000 CHS need \nbetter  equipment to provide  essential  health  services,  including for  the  timely  detection of  and \nresponse to communicable diseases. CHS lack the capacity for quick and accurate diagnosis of \npatients because of inadequate equipment and health workforce with an inappropriate skill mix. \nPatients  perceive  CHS  to  be  of  poor  quality  and  often  bypass  them  for  higher-level  and  more \nexpensive  facilities.  Many  conditions  for  which  higher-level  care  is  sought  could  be  treated  at \nCHS,  including  NCDs  and  age-related  illnesses. 14  Further,  patients  using  the  LHC  system \nreceive  limited  coverage  from  health  insurance.  As  a  result,  out-of-pocket  health  expenditure \n                                                \n8  An NCD is a medical condition or disease that is not caused by an infectious agent. \n9  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Global Burden of Disease database. https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-\n\ncompare/ (accessed 26 April 2018). \n\n10 Health  expenditure  is  considered  catastrophic  if  a  household\u2019s  financial  contributions  to  health  equal  or  exceed \n40% of non-food expenditures.

Health security relates to activities required to minimize \nvulnerability to these threats.  \n\n13 Government  of  Viet  Nam,  MOH.

Improving \naccess to quality LHC services, particularly in poorer rural areas, will have a positive impact on \nhealth outcomes.  \n \nBinding  constraints.  The  government  has  recognized  the  following  development \n7. \nconstraints:  (i)  an  inadequate framework  and  supporting  policies  to  guide  public  investment  in \nLHC,  (ii)  the  failure  of  LHC  service  delivery  to  respond  to  health  needs,  and  (iii)  weak  LHC \nworkforce management and development. \n \n8. \nInadequate framework and supporting policies to guide public investment in local \nhealth care. The MOH has prepared a comprehensive framework for the development of LHC, \nincluding technical standards for facilities, equipment, human resources, and service provision. \nHowever, many are outdated and do not address the system\u2019s current challenges. Inadequate \ninvestment  in  the  LHC  system  and  a  lack  of  financing  mechanisms  perpetuate  system \ndeficiencies. The institutional arrangements for fiscal transfers from central to local governments \nand the incentives for local governments, to pursue the national health reform agenda are weak. \nWhile Viet Nam has a well-established health insurance system, additional reforms are required \nto increase health insurance revenues and to improve the affordability of health services.  \n \n9. \nFailure  of  local  health  care  service  delivery  to  respond  to  health  needs. \nApproximately  74%  of  all  outpatients  visit  hospitals  and  private  facilities,  while  only  20%  visit \npublic  CHS  due  to  the  limited  range  of  available  interventions. 15  CHS  do  not  deliver  a \ncomprehensive  mix  of  primary  care  and  curative  services,  nor  do  they  address  the  lifelong \nhealth  needs  of  women  and  men  in  the  community.  For  example,  CHSs  are  not  equipped  to \nprovide  for  the  effective  management  of  NCD,  across  a  continuum  of  prevention  and  early \nintervention  services. 16  Moreover,  district  health  centers  and  district  hospitals  operate \nseparately, largely without referral and linkage, causing inefficiencies and service overlaps.  \n \n10.  Weak  local  health  care  workforce  management  and  development.  The  LHC \nworkforce  does  not  have  the  required  skills  mix  to  effectively  respond  to  the  evolving  health \nneeds  of  the  population,  especially  women.  CHS  are  staffed  with  lower-skilled  health \npractitioners,  particularly in  remote  and mountainous regions (footnote  16). They  also  lack  the \ncapacity to provide long-term care for the elderly and patients with chronic diseases. There is a \nneed  to  enhance  their  competencies  in  epidemiology  and  in  responding  to  health  security \nthreats.17 Moreover, health service providers have not been provided with the training to work in \na  gender-sensitive  and  culturally  appropriate  manner  when  dealing  with  female  and  ethnic \nminority patients. While ADB has previously supported the MOH\u2019s health professional licensing \nand registration system, service delivery in LHC facilities remains largely unregulated.18 \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n11. \n\nThe  government\u2019s  reform  agenda.

Viet Nam: Health Human Resource Sector Development Program. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fsystem  is  essential  for  sustainable  inclusive  development. 19 The  health  sector  5-year  plan, \n2016\u20132020  identifies  the  LHC  network  as  one  of  nine  key  reform  areas. 20 Reforms  aim  to \nstrengthen  the  grassroots  health  network  by  (i)  increasing  investment  in  infrastructure  and \nequipment  for  district  and  commune  health  facilities;  (ii)  restructuring  the  LHC\u2019s  organization \nand  operations  to  be  more  responsive  to  epidemiological  changes;  (iii)  reforming  finance \nmechanisms  for  central  and  local  governments;  (iv)  improving  service  delivery  by  providing \nintegrated services for infectious diseases, NCDs, and injuries; and (v) responding to epidemics \nthrough  early  detection,  prevention,  and  response  plans.  The  National  Action  Plan  for  the \nImplementation  of  the  2030  Sustainable  Development  Agenda  confirms  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment  towards  achieving  UHC,  which  includes  ensuring  access  to  essential  health  care \nservices.21 \n \nSector  development  program.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Viet  Nam \n12. \n2016\u20132020 prioritizes support to UHC as the focus of health sector operations. The program is \naligned with  the  operational  priorities  of  ADB  Strategy  2030 (Table 1).22 A sector  development \nprogram  is  appropriate  given  Viet  Nam\u2019s  limited  fiscal  space,  need  for  PFM  reform,  and \ninclusive  growth  agenda.23 The  program  supports  the  health  sector  5-year  plan\u2019s  objectives  to \nenhance  the  accessibility,  responsiveness,  quality,  and  affordability  of  LHC,  particularly  in \ndisadvantaged  and  remote  areas  (footnote  20).  The  PBL  will  provide  budget  support  and \ncontribute  to  fiscal  consolidation  through  targeted  transfers  in  the  health  sector,  allowing  the \ngovernment  to  sustain  budget  allocations  to  the  MOH  while  implementing  a  complex  reform \nprogram. MOH has demonstrated experience with sector development programs (footnote 18). \nSpecifically,  the  PBL  addresses  key  reform  areas  governing  public  investment,  health  service \ndelivery,  and  health  workforce  quality  in  the  LHC  system,  through  14  policy  actions  (all \naccomplished).  The  associated  project  grant  will  complement  the  PBL  by  implementing  LHC \nsystem  reforms  including  infrastructure  and  equipment  standards,  and  health  insurance \nbenefits.  The  project  grant  will  pilot  health  service  delivery  models  and  inform  institutional \narrangements in support of attaining UHC goals. The project grant component supports reforms \nin 12 pilot districts in six provinces along borders and socioeconomic corridors with high poverty \nincidence, ethnic minority populations, and susceptibility to health security threats.24 \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n\n1.

The \ngovernment  established  an  enabling  policy  and  institutional  framework  to  govern  and  guide \npublic investments for the delivery of LHC services. A master plan has been approved (footnote \n3) which sets the direction of the required policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms of the LHC \nsystem.25 Based  on  the  master  plan,  the  MOH  updated  architectural,  equipment,  and  human \nresource  standards  for  CHS  and  upgraded  LHC  infrastructure.  As  a  result,  70%  of  CHS  now \nmeet the national service standards (2017). To ensure revenues for LHC services, the MOH has \nenacted  a  series  of  policies  defining  a  list  of  health  services,  medical  procedures,  and  drugs \ncovered  by  health  insurance  funds  to  be  delivered  by  CHS.  Further,  by  increasing  health \ninsurance  coverage  to  86.4%  of  the  population  (2017),  the  government  has  successfully \nincreased health facility revenues from health insurance. \n \nThe  project  grant  will  provide  equipment  for  pilot  districts  to  meet  the  national  service \n14. \nstandards,  including  equipment  for  (i)  diagnosis  of  infectious  diseases,  which  threaten  health \nsecurity;  (ii)  NCD  detection  and  management;  and  (iii)  sexual  and  reproductive  health  (SRH)-\nrelated  services.  Results  from  pilot  districts  will  inform  necessary  adjustments  to  technical \nstandards for CHS, the financing mechanism, and the benefits provided by health insurance. \n \n15. \nReform area 2: Service delivery models for local health care network. To meet the \nchallenges  of  the  rising  NCD  burden  and  public  health  threats,  and  to  respond  to  the  specific \nneeds of women, children, and indigenous peoples, the MOH formulated a set of policies aimed \nat improving health service delivery.  An expanded package of health services for curative and \npreventive services has been adopted, which addresses the increasing needs of the population. \nSRH  services  and  gender-based  violence  prevention  and  response  programs  have  been \nstrengthened.  Specific  plans  for  indigenous  peoples  have  been  introduced.  The  MOH  has \nadopted  and  scaled  up  the  family  medicine  model,  which  encompasses  the  holistic \nmanagement  of  an  individual\u2019s  health  needs  across  the  continuum  of  prevention,  early \nintervention,  and  treatment.  To  address  gaps  in  long-term  care,  the  MOH  has  approved  the \nscope,  target,  and  budget  for  a  national  program  targeting  the  elderly.  The  MOH  linked \nindividual electronic health records to the communicable diseases information system as a tool \nfor  referring  patients  between  different  levels  of  health  services,  and  has  implemented  health \nfinancing  through  health  insurance.  Finally,  provincial  centers  for  disease  control  have  been \nestablished and the functions of health centers and hospitals in 202 districts have been merged \nto better coordinate outbreak response and mitigate health security threats. \n \n16. \nThe  project  grant  will  enhance  responsiveness  of  LHC  service  delivery  through  new \nservice delivery model(s) for disease surveillance and response, primary health care, and long-\nterm  care  using  family  medicine  principles.  The  grant  will  equip  pilot  district  health  facilities to \nmeet the service delivery requirements of the family medicine model and implement the model \n\n                                                \n25 The master plan provides the road map to (i) upgrade and equip all CHS in the country, (ii) improve knowledge and \nskills  of  LHC  staff,  (iii)  reform  the  packages  of  health  services  offered  by  LHC  facilities,  and  (iv)  improve  health \nfinancing mechanisms through health insurance. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fin  selected  CHS. 26  Electronic  health  records  will  be  linked  to  the  communicable  diseases \ninformation  system  in  selected  health  facilities.  Gender-sensitive  information  campaigns  on \nfamily medicine will be conducted and SRH-related services will be provided. District response \nunits  will  be  equipped  to  address  health  security  threats  (footnote  12).  Finally,  analytical  work \nwill  help  to  optimize  operational  efficacy  of  the  family  medicine  model  before  the  nationwide \nrollout of reforms and health financing through health insurance. \n \n17. \nReform  area  3:  Local  health  care  workforce  development  and  management.  The \nMOH has implemented reforms designed to achieve better gender balance in management and \nleadership  roles  based  on  the  MOH  gender  equality  action  plan,  2016\u20132020. 27  The  MOH \nincreased the proportion of CHS served by a medical doctor to 88% in 2017.28 Measures were \nimplemented  to  improve  staff  knowledge  and  skills  through  a  training  curriculum  on  family \nmedicine for doctors, nurses, midwives, assistant doctors, and assistant pharmacists.29 A policy \nwas issued on health facility licensing for family medicine. \n \n18. \nThe  project  grant  will  strengthen  the  quality  of  the  LHC  workforce  in  pilot  districts.  To \ncomplement  the  health  human  resources  policy,  the  grant  will  assess  the  capacity  of  LHC \nfacilities  for  health  security  functions,  family  medicine,  provision  of  a  basic  health  service \npackage,  and  service  management.  Competencies  of  CHS  staff  will  be  enhanced  through  the \nprovision  of  scholarships  for  a  3-month  certificate  on  family  medicine  for  CHS  doctors. \nContinuing professional education will be provided for assistant doctors, nurses, and midwives. \nTraining  on  communicable  diseases,  NCDs,  elderly  care,  SRH,  responses  to  outbreaks,  and \nelectronic health records will be conducted. \n \nADB  experience.  Since  1995,  ADB  assistance  to  the  Viet  Nam  health  sector  has \n19. \nfocused on improving access to and the quality of health care, especially for the poor and ethnic \nminorities. From 1995 to 2005, ADB provided support to (i) strengthen primary health care and \nfamily  planning  services  in  15  provinces;30 (ii)  improve  primary  health  facilities,  management \ncapacity,  and  human  resources  in  14  provinces;31 and  (iii)  develop  hospitals,  health  service \nmanagement,  health  care  funds  for  the  poor,  and  human  resources  in  five  mountainous  and \nethnic minority provinces. During 2006\u20132016, ADB continued its investment in health services in \nremote  areas,32 while  providing  more  focused  support  for  health  security. 33 ADB  operations \nincluded  (i)  upgrading  preventive  health  centers  in  15  provinces;  and  (ii)  enhancing  regional, \nnational, and subnational systems for prevention, surveillance, and response to health security \nthreats.  ADB  also  focused  investment  in  health  human  resource  development  through  sector-\nwide reforms in health professional education, training, and management (footnote 18). \n\n                                                \n26 Family  medicine  model  implementation  at  CHS  includes  establishing  a  personalized  electronic  health  record \nsystem; having a family medicine-certified doctor; and having at least a midwife, nurse, or assistant doctor who has \nattended a short course on family medicine. \n\n27 Government of Viet Nam, MOH.

The  program  design  integrates  the  lessons  learned  from  previous \nADB  interventions. Institutional  reforms require  a  long-term  strategy  and policy  coherence that \nbuild  upon  prior  gains  and  achievements,  thereby  creating  the  desired  impact  over  time. \nDevelopment effectiveness is enhanced by (i) strengthening development partner coordination, \nand  (ii)  sustaining  support  for  institutional  development  and  capacity  building.  Addressing \ncomplex  disease  patterns,  population  aging,  and  entrenched  health  inequity  requires  a  shift  to \nmore responsive  and  comprehensive  health  service delivery  models.  A  strong  and functioning \nLHC system supports timely detection of and response to health security threats both at country \nlevel and cross-border, the latter through regional cooperation.  \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition. ADB\u2019s assistance in Viet Nam ensures the required institutional \narrangements  required  for  UHC\u2014a  strong  LHC  network,  quality  health  human resources,  and \nuniversal  access  to  social  health  insurance.  ADB  assisted  MOH  to  formulate  and  implement \npolicy  reforms  for  strengthening  LHC,  through  structured  policy  dialogue  informed  by  past \nprogramming. This includes in the areas of communicable disease control (footnote 33), health \nservice  delivery  (footnote  32)  and  health  practitioner  training  and  management  (footnote  18). \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  has  also  been  enhanced  by  maximizing  linkages  across  individual \ninvestments, which creates synergies to achieve sector-wide and regional impacts. Linking the \nprogram with the ongoing regional effort to strengthen health security in the Greater Mekong Sub-\nregion is illustrative of this (footnote 33). \n \n22. \nframework \nprovides  a  common  understanding  of  subsequent  reform  areas  to  be  supported  by  the \ngovernment,  ADB,  and  development  partners  (Appendix  4,  column  3).  The  proposed  Second \nHealth  Human  Resources  Development  Project  (2019\u20132025)  will  complement  the  program  by \nincreasing  the  supply  of  skilled  workers  to  provide  quality  services,  particularly  at  the  LHC  level. \nSubsequent analytical work and policy dialogue for PFM reforms and fiscal consolidation efforts \nthrough  a  national  targeted  program  for  health  sector  investment  are  required.  ADB \nstrengthened its role as knowledge provider by delivering the initial phase of reforms based on \nanalytical  work  and  technical  assistance  to  support  health  insurance  and  health  information \nsystems  development.  ADB  has  ongoing  technical  assistance  to  strengthen  the  institutional \ncapacity  of  the  MOH  to  deliver  its  reform  agenda  and  identify  subsequent  regulatory  and \ninstitutional  reform  areas. 34  This  coordinated  approach  sets  a  solid  foundation  for  ADB\u2019s \nprogressive support for health sector reforms aimed at progressing towards UHC (footnote 22).   \n\nPost-program  partnership  framework.  The  post-program  partnership \n\nDevelopment coordination. The master plan provides the overarching framework for a \n23. \ncoordinated  and  phased  development  partner  response  to  strengthen  the  LHC  network \n(footnote  3).  ADB,  the  European  Union  (EU),  and  the  World  Bank  coordinate  and  harmonize \ninvestments to achieve system-wide impacts as envisaged under the master plan. The current \nphase of development partner support to implement the master plan includes (i) the EU\u2019s Health \nSector  Policy  Support  Programme  (Phase  2), 35  (ii)  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Health  Professionals \nEducation and Training for Health Systems Reforms Project (cofinanced by the EU),36 and (iii) \nthe World  Bank\u2019s  proposed  Grassroots  Service Delivery  Reform  Project.  ADB  maintains  close \ndialogue with the International Monetary Fund on Viet Nam\u2019s economic and policy performance.  \n                                                \n34 ADB.

The  program  addresses  Viet  Nam\u2019s  need  for \nreforms to improve accessibility, responsiveness, and quality of the LHC system. The program\u2019s \nbenefits  derive  from  a  reduction  in  (i)  the  morbidity  and  premature  mortality  among  poor, \ndisadvantaged,  and  ethnic  minority  populations,  and  (ii)  health  expenditures  through  greater \nutilization of lower-level health facilities. The program will strengthen capacity to prevent disease \noutbreaks and pandemics and reduce the associated potential economic losses.37 \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n25. \nThe  program  financing  amount  is  $102.2  million.  The  government  has  requested  (i)  a \nconcessional  loan  of  $88.6  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  and  (ii)  a  grant  not \nexceeding $12.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help \nfinance the program (Table 2). The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  of  2.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter;  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The PBL release will be aligned \nwith  government\u2019s  investment  and  budgeting  processes,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). The project investment plan is \nin Table 3. The size of the PBL reflects the government\u2019s overall financing needs, the strength \nof  the  reforms,  and  development  expenditures  arising  from  the  program,  such  as  CHS \ninfrastructure  upgrade,  capacity  building,  and  incentives  for  the  health  workforce.  In  2018,  the \ngovernment\u2019s budget deficit target is 3.5% of GDP, with a gross financing need of $17.1 billion. \nTo meet the financing demand, the government plans to raise $12.3 billion from the issuance of \nsecurities and $4.8 billion from official foreign loans. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary capital resources (concessional policy-\nbased loan) \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund regional health security grant) \n\nAmount ($ million) \n \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n\n88.6 \n \n12.0 \n\n86.7 \n \n11.7 \n\nGovernment of Viet Nama \n\n1.6 \n100.0 \na  Government  counterpart  funding  is  estimated  at  $1.6  million  and  includes  civil  servants\u2019  salaries,  in-kind \n\n1.6 \n102.2 \n\nTotal \n\nprovision of assets (office space, equipment, recurrent operating costs), or other paid-for costs. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable 3: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nBase Costa \n\nItem \nA. \n\n \n \n \n\n1.

Economic  analysis  of  pilot  provinces  suggests  that  the \nproposed  investments  in  health services  and  infrastructure  are  economically  viable.  Economic \nbenefits will occur from increased utilization of lower-level LHC facilities and the family medicine \nservices,  which  will  reduce  healthcare  costs,  along  with  gains  in  labor  productivity  because  of \nthe population will be healthier. The net present value of estimated benefits less costs is $25.0 \nmillion over a 15-year period. The economic analysis has not included benefits arising from the \nlower risk of economic shocks achieved through greater control of communicable diseases, so \nthe quantified benefits are likely to be conservative estimates. Careful health sector planning will \nbe  required  to  ensure  sufficient  resources  to  support  recurrent  costs  and  ensure  financial \n\n                                                \n38 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\ffound  governance  risk \n\nGovernance.

The  MOH\u2019s  experience  with  externally  financed  projects,  including  those  of  ADB, \nindicates  adequate  overall  capacity.  Project  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  MOH  procurement \nteams  are  experienced  in  ADB  procurement  procedures,  and  the  requirements  of  the \ngovernment are broadly aligned with international procurement practices. Advanced training on \nADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement \nRegulation  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  for  time  to  time)  is  recommended  for  the \ncentral  project  management  unit  of  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nthe Government of Viet Nam. \n  \n29. \nPoverty  and  social  impacts.  The  program  will  help  improve  access  and  increase  the \nresponsiveness  and  quality  of  LHC  services  for  populations  in  disadvantaged,  mountainous, \nremote,  and  border  areas.  The  program  contributes  directly  to  improved  health  status, \nespecially  for  the  poor.  Further,  indirect  contributions  to  poverty  reduction  will  ensue  from \nreductions in catastrophic health expenditure, a result of increasing health insurance coverage, \nand  improvements  in  people\u2019s  productivity.  The  project  will  benefit  populations  residing  in  six \nprovinces  with  high  poverty  incidence.  Enhanced  access  to  responsive  and  quality  LHC \nservices brings benefits to vulnerable populations in remote and border areas most susceptible \nto health security threats. These include the poor and minority populations for whom morbidity \nand  mortality  attributable  to  infectious  diseases  remain  high,  and  vulnerable  populations  in \ndisadvantaged areas where the NCD burden is highest. \n\n30. \nGender.  The  program\u2019s  gender  category  is  gender  equity  as  a  theme.  The  program  is \nexpected to contribute to gender equality and women's empowerment through improved health \noutcomes  for  women  and  girls.  Women  and  girls  will  have  improved  access  to  quality  local \nessential  health  services  through  CHS  that  are  well  equipped  and  incorporate  gender-friendly \ndesign  features.  Service  delivery  will  accommodate  women\u2019s  social  and  cultural  preferences, \nincluding  those  of  ethnic  minority  women  and  good-quality  services  critical  to  women\u2019s  health \nand  well-being,  including  SRH  services.  The  policy-based  program  supports  the  launch  and \nimplementation  of  the  health  sector  action  plan  on  gender  equality  covering  2016\u20132020 \n(footnote  27)  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  other  policies  aimed  at  enhancing  access  to  health \nservices for women, children, and ethnic minorities. The project includes a gender action plan to \nsupport  implementation  of  the  MOH  gender  equality  action  plan  and  other  gender-related \npolicies  in  areas  including  SRH,  domestic  violence,  and  the  provision  of  gender-  and  ethnic \nminority-sensitive health services. \n\nSafeguards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \n31. \nis  categorized  C  for  environment  because  none  of  the  policy  reform  actions  or  investments  in \ndistrict hospitals involve civil works, and none are anticipated to result in adverse environmental \nimpacts  or  increased  health  and  safety  risks.  The  program  is  categorized  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement  since  no  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  expected.  A \nmatrix  of  potential  impacts  of  policy  actions  has  been  prepared.  The  program  is  expected  to \nbring  positive  impacts  to  ethnic  minorities  such  as  improving  the  capacity  of  ethnic  minority \nhealth care staff and improving minorities\u2019 access to health services and improving the quality of \nthose  services,  especially  in  disadvantaged  and  remote  areas.  The  program  is  classified \ncategory B for indigenous peoples. The ethnic minority development plan will ensure that project \ngrant activities benefit ethnic minorities.   \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \n32. \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 39  Country  risks  pertain  to \nmacroeconomic  instability,  a  high  level  of  public debt,  and  a  shift  in political  leadership,  which \nweakens  support  for  LHC.  CHS  may  not  receive  sufficient  budget  to  finance  reform \nimplementation. Country level risks will be mitigated through continuous policy dialogue, support \nfor  targeted  interventions,  and  other  specific  measures  to  strengthen  PFM.  Project  pre-\nmitigation  risk  for  PFM  is  rated  high  because  each  Department  of  Health  in  the  six  target \nprovinces  will  manage  a  subaccount.  Project  procurement  pre-mitigation  risk  is  rated  high. \nMitigation  measures  include  staff  capacity  building  and  assistance  from  experts.  The  pilot \ndistricts  will  prepare  annual  plans  and  budgets  to  ensure  that  the  equipment  will  remain \noperational.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs,  and \nfiduciary arrangements are put forward to minimize financial management risks. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n33. \nThe government and MOH have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and MOH have also \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which are set forth in the related legal \nagreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the \n34. \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan of $88,600,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Local Health \nCare  for  Disadvantaged  Areas  Sector  Development  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the \nrate  of  2.0%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board; and \nthe grant not exceeding $12,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Local Health \nCare  for  Disadvantaged  Areas  Sector  Development  Program,  on  terms  and \nconditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \ngrant agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n19 November 2018 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n                                                \n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n) \n\nBy 2026, nationwide: \n\n \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and Baselines \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nUniversal health coverage for all citizens achieved (National Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 \nSustainable Development Agenda)a \n \n \nResults Chain \nEffects of the \nReform \nQuality of and \naccess to LHC \nservices for women \nand men, \nparticularly in \ndisadvantaged and \nremote areas, \nimproved \n\nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms \n\na. 90% of CHS meet MOH\u2019s 2014 national standards \nfor health service delivery   \n(2017 baseline: 70% as per 2014 standards)b \n \nb.
