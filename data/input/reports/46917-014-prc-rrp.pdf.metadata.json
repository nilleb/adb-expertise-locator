According to the China \nFederation  of  Logistics  and  Purchasing  in  2007,  demand  for  logistics  service  in  the  PRC  had \nreached  CNY75.2  billion,  a  year-on-year  increase  of  26.2%;  and  cargo  volume  reached \n22.53 billion  tons,  a  year-on-year  increase  of  10.7%. 1 However,  because  of  lack  of  proper \ninfrastructure, food is transported and stored  without a controlled environment\u2014shortening the \nshelf  life  and  resulting  in  higher  spoilage  rates.  This  has  significantly  increased  demand  for \nrefrigerated or cold chain logistics.  \n \n3. \nA cold chain is a temperature-controlled supply chain that forms a critical element in an \nuninterrupted  series  of  storage  and  distribution  activities.  It  helps  ensure  the  shelf  life  of \nproducts  such  as  fresh  agricultural  produce,  frozen  food,  photographic  film,  chemicals,  and \npharmaceutical  drugs.  This  process  is  preferred  because  of  its  ability  to  prolong  the  quality  of \nperishable goods. Throughout the process of production, storage, transportation, and delivery to \nthe  consumer,  these  products  must  be  maintained  in  a  low  temperature  environment  to \npreserve their quality. In developed countries such as Australia, Canada, and the United States \n(US),  a seamless  cold chain  logistics  system for  agricultural  products  is a fundamental  part of \nlogistics  infrastructure  and  the  cold  chain  network  has  average  coverage  of  80%\u2013100%  of the \nmarket.  In  the  US,  frozen  food  transport  amounts  to  20  million  tons  annually,  encompassing \nalmost  3,000  varieties  of  products,  and  equates  to  per  capita  consumption  of  almost \n60 kilograms. \n \n4. \nIf approved, the project will be the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) first intervention \nin logistics in the PRC.2 Cold chain logistics is a relatively nascent  industry in the PRC, so the \nproposed  intervention  from  ADB  will  highlight  the  importance  of  logistics  in  relation  to  food \nsafety. This is in line with the Food Safety Law, 2009, which establishes and improves the food \nsafety management system and adopts efficient management measures to ensure food safety \nin  the  PRC.  It  is  also  in  line  with  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  calls  for  the \ndevelopment of a modern logistics industry in the PRC.3 The facility can be used as a model for \nbest  practices \nlogistics \nmanagement, and trading systems. ADB can leverage the project to higher-level dialogue with \nthe  Government  of  the  PRC  to  develop  optimal  health,  sanitary,  and  phytosanitary  inspection \nprotocols for refrigerated freight.  \n\ninternational  common  warehouse  management  systems, \n\nin \n\n                                                \n1 ResearchInChina. 2008. China Logistics Industry Report, 2007-2008. Beijing. ResearchInChina. \n2 ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) formally took over the functions and responsibility to process \nand implement loans to subsovereign and nonsovereign public sector entities from the regional departments on 1 \nApril 2012. The Project will be the first nonsovereign public sector project processed by PSOD since April 2012. \n\n3 Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n\f 2 \n\nThe  project  will  also play  a positive role  in  supporting regional  cooperation,  particularly \n5. \nbetween  the  PRC  and  Mongolia.  ADB  supports  PRC\u2013Mongolia  cooperation  under  the  broad \nframework and as an integral part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nprogram.  One  of  the  key  objectives  of  PRC\u2013Mongolia  cooperation  in  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation  areas  is  to  improve  Mongolia\u2019s  access  to  international  markets.  As  a  landlocked \ncountry, Mongolia relies on the PRC for the nearest sea access. Tianjin, which is located at the \nsouth  end  of  the  CAREC  transport  corridor  4b  linking  Mongolia  and  the  PRC,  has  since  the \n1990s served as the only seaport for bulk of Mongolia\u2019s international trade based on a bilateral \nagreement  signed  in  1991.  As  part  of  the  assistance  to  PRC\u2013Mongolia  cooperation  in  trade \nfacilitation,  ADB  has  been  making  efforts  to  improve  ties  between  Mongolia\u2019s  foreign  trade \ncommunities and their counterparts in Tianjin.4 The enhanced capacity in cold chain logistics in \nTianjin to be realized under the project will help provide better services to Mongolia\u2019s export of \nagricultural produce, particularly meat and dairy products. \n \n6. \nTianjin  Binhai  TEDA  Logistics  Group  (TBTL)  is  a  leading  logistics  service  provider  in \nTianjin, which is a key port in the northeastern seaboard.5 TBTL is 70% owned by the state6 and \n30% listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. TBTL is active \nin a number of logistics areas through wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries, such as container \nyard operation, bulk commodities (steel alloys in particular), logistics for Toyota automobiles and \nparts,  as  well  as  short-term  financing  services  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  Cold \nchain  logistics  presents  a  new  opportunity  for  TBTL  to  fulfill  an  opportunity  in  the  market  and \naddress the lack of facilities and services in Tianjin Binhai New Area. \n \n7. \nfinancial  and \nmanagement  capabilities  and  efficient  operations.  In  addition  to  supporting  TBTL  in  its  new \nventure,  the  project  will  lead  to  additional  development  impacts  through  private  sector \nparticipation in a new industry, policy dialogue, and improved trade facilitation. \n \n\nteam  has  confirmed  TBTL\u2019s \n\nThrough  due  diligence, \n\nthe  project \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n8. \nTBTL  is  allocating  existing  resources  to  explore  new  businesses  and  diversification  of \nrevenue sources. It purchased 9 hectares (ha) of land in 2007 and 8 ha in 2009 in the Tianjin \nport  area.  After  detailed  market  research  and  consultation  with  Tianjin  Commodity  Inspection \nBureau  and  other  government  departments,  TBTL  determined  that  the  cold  chain  logistics \nmarket would be a suitable new venture. Tianjin port has no cold storage, customs inspection, \nor special inspection facilities\u2014providing a compelling opportunity for a third-party operator. The \nland  purchased  is  intended for frozen food  warehouses and as  a  location for related  customs, \nhealth, and phytosanitary inspections.  \n \n9. \nTedahang Cold Chain Logistics (TCCL) is a joint venture project company among TBTL, \nToyota  Tsusho,  and  Kamigumi  focused  on  the  cold  chain  logistics  business.  For  TBTL,  TCCL \nwill be a market entry point to the cold chain logistics industry. The project will enable TBTL to \ncapture the rapid growth in logistics, while serving as a model for the development of the cold \n\n                                                \n4   During a PRC\u2013Mongolia joint consultation workshop on regional cooperation held in the PRC in May 2011 under \nregional  technical  assistance  (ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  for  the  Development  of  Regional  Cooperation \nPrograms for Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of China [Phase 2]. Manila [TA 7618-REG]), ADB organized a \nfield trip for the Mongolian government officials and business community representatives to Tianjin. The Mongolian \ndelegates had discussions with various authorities in Tianjin port, and visited Tianjin Binhai TEDA Logistics Group. \nBoth sides expressed strong interest in cooperating in the trade logistics area.  \n\n5   Tianjin Binhai TEDA Logistics Group. http://www.tbtl.cn/en/01.aspx \n6   Held by TEDA, Tianjin municipal government\u2019s investment arm.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nchain  logistics  industry  in  the  PRC.  Lastly,  it  will  lead  to  downstream  development  and \nexpansion  to  cold  chain  transport,  general  commercial  cold  storage,  and  related  cold  chain \nlogistics  business.  TBTL  believes  its  cold  chain  logistics  facility  will  help  Mongolia\u2019s  export  of \nmeat  and  related  products;  and  it  has  had  discussions  with  Mongolian  counterparts,  including \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, for the proposal and has received encouraging feedback. TBTL also \nbelieves  that  its  long-term  partnership  with  Toyota  will  be  highly  complementary  in  expanding \nthe cold chain logistics supply chain once the current project matures. \n \nLocated  in  Tianjin  Port  Container  Logistics  Center,  the  site  will  have  a  large-capacity \n10. \ncold  storage  facility\u2014including  merchandise  handling,  warehousing,  logistics  equipment,  and \ninspection facility\u2014combined with a customs inspection service facility for fruits and vegetables, \nmeat, and aquatic products. Three cold storage warehouses and affiliated facilities will be built \nat  a  total  cost  of  CNY600  million.  The  cold  storage  houses  will  have  various  temperature \nzones\u2014from a deep cold of \u201350\u00b0C for seafood to below \u201320\u00b0C for most meats and above 0\u00b0C \nfor vegetables, fruits, and flowers. The facility will cover about 8 ha, including the main function \nbuildings;  housing  customs  inspection  facility  for  large  cold  storage  shipments;  refrigerated \ncontainer yard; and logistics, office, and supporting ancillary facilities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor \n\nlogistics  service  systems, \n\n \nTBTL  was  established  on  26  June  2006  with  CNY354  million  registered  capital.  It \n11. \nintegrated the logistics resources of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding and TEDA State-Owned \nAssets Operation Corporation. TBTL was listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of Hong Kong \nStock  Exchange on  30 April  2008.  It  is  a holding  company,  with its  subsidiary  companies  and \nincluding \njointly  controlled  entities  providing  comprehensive \nspecialized electronic parts logistics services, professional general bonded warehouse logistics \nservices, and logistics financing and bulk commodities trading.  \n \nAs  an  industry  leader  in  Tianjin  Binhai  New  Area,  TBTL  has  invested  in  infrastructure \n12. \nfacility  resources  and  a  logistics  management  system,  thus  gaining  extensive  experience  and \nmanagement  technologies  for  logistics  services.  TBTL  intends  to  integrate  the  traditional \nlogistics industry with the manufacturing and finance industries, streamlining the current supply \nchain and optimizing internal management. In 2010, TBTL\u2019s businesses grew with the recovery \nof the macroeconomic environment. It experienced growth in logistics and supply chain services \nfor transportation of finished automobile and electronic components; materials procurement; and \ntraditional logistics services such as stacking yard, logistics supervision, and agency services. \n \n13. \nRevenue and profits in 2010 were the highest since the public listing in 2008, while 2011 \nrevenues suffered as a result of the earthquake in Japan and the tightening of monetary policy \nin  the  PRC. TBTL will  continue to  optimize  its  business  structure by  repositioning  its  business \nfocus  and  customer  base,  and  improving  capital  utilization  efficiency  with  respect  to  materials \nprocurement and related logistics services.  \n \nB. \n \n14. \ninfrastructure in cold chain storage and distribution through the following: \n \n\nImpact. The project will address the growing concern over food safety caused by lack of \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n(i) \n\nIncreased trade  of  agriculture products  between Mongolia  and the PRC. The \nproject  will  improve  access  to  the  import\u2013export  market  for  agricultural  produce \nthrough the provision of cold chain handling, storage, and inspection services. It will \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nalso facilitate trade of agricultural products for Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, \nMongolia,  and  the  PRC  as  improved  temperature-controlled  environment  and \nmaterial-handling capacity can make new agricultural and industrial products viable \nfor export markets. \n\n(ii) \n\nIncreased capacity in PRC cold chain logistics. By providing additional storage \nin  Tianjin  port,  the  project  will  increase  the  capacity  for  cold  chain  logistics\u2014\nreducing food wastage resulting from inappropriate food storage. \n\n(iii)  Wider  adoption  of  best  practices  in  warehouse  management,  logistics \nmanagement,  and  trading  systems.  The  project  will  introduce  modern  best \npractice  in  international  common  warehouse  management  system,  logistics \nmanagement,  and  trading  system;  and  can  potentially  be  a  demonstration  project \nfor  setting  industry  standards  for  cold  chain  logistics.  TCCL  will  also  collaborate \nwith Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau and Tianjin Customs to develop optimal \nhealth, sanitary, and phytosanitary inspection protocol for refrigerated freight.  \n \n\nOutcome. The outcome will be the improved efficiency and capacity of logistics facilities \n15. \nin  Tianjin  port.  The  development  of  improved  logistics  facilities  critical  for  agricultural \ntransportation and storage will increase capacity in handling perishable products.  \n \n16. \nadoption of best practices in warehouse logistics management and trading systems. \n \nC. \n \n\nOutputs. The physical outputs will be the completion of the cold storage facility and the \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \n17. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  Strategy  2020  in  terms  of  inclusive  economic  growth  in \ndeveloping  and  expanding  economic  activities  by  increasing  access  to  new  markets  for \nagricultural  products. 7  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  two  of  the  five  core  areas  of \noperational  focus  identified:  infrastructure  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  ADB\u2019s \nintervention in the project aims to (i) increase policy dialogue; (ii) encourage the participation of \nprivate  capital  for  developing  the  refrigerated  supply-chain  and  logistics  infrastructure  facility \nthat will bring in state-of-the-art technology, know-how, and processes, with benefits in material-\nhandling  capacity  and  improved  energy  efficiency;  and  (iii)  facilitate  Mongolia\u2019s  international \ntrade of agriculture products. Additionally, development of the facility will foster improvements in \ntransportation  logistics  and  customs  management,  leading  to  more  efficient  traffic,  facilitating \ntrade of frozen produce, reducing transit cost, and fostering increased trade.  \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  the  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  through \npillar  1:  inclusive  growth,  seeking  to  foster  a  balanced  and  equitable  development,  including \nlending  activities  in  regional  and  subregional  infrastructure  projects.8 Furthermore,  the  project \nwill address transport connectivity and trade facilitation to promote transport and trade activities \nalong economic corridors, (in particular CAREC Corridor 4b), one of the drivers of change. The \ndevelopment  of  the  refrigerated  supply-chain  and  logistics  facility  will  reduce  spoilage  and \nincrease the value of agricultural produce. \n\n                                                \n7   ADB.  2008.

Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nPillar  1  of  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration  strategy  states  that  physical \n19. \nconnections\u2014particularly  robust  transport  and  communication  links\u2014are  essential  for  the \nmovement  of  goods,  services,  people,  and  information  across  countries;  and  is  thus  a central \nelement  of  regional  and  subregional  cooperation  programs  in  Asia  and the  Pacific. 9 However, \nphysical  connectivity  needs  to  be  supported  by  harmonization  of  regulations,  procedures,  and \nstandards;  improved  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks;  and  efficient  systems  of  customs \nclearance. The Project is in close alignment with elements of this strategy \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n \n20. \nIn  terms  of  food  safety,  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  National  Food  Safety \nRegulatory  and Strategic  Framework  was implemented to  help strengthen  the  State  Food  and \nDrug  Administration  through  formulation  of  a  comprehensive  framework  covering  food  safety \npolicies,  laws  and  regulations,  and  standards,  as  well  as  cross-agency  coordination  to  ensure \ntheir  effective implementation. The TA  recommendation for reforms  was  communicated  in two \ncore  areas\u2014institutional  reform \nimproved  coordination\u2014and  has \nfor  streamlining  and \ncontributed  to  the  draft  Food  Safety  Law,  which  is  a  substantial  improvement  from  previously \nfragmented legislation, and a meaningful step toward a comprehensive legal framework.10 \n \n21. \nCurrent  ADB  operations  in  logistics  and trade facilitation include the  Regional  Logistics \nDevelopment  Project  in  Mongolia, 11  which  will  be  implemented  in  Zamyn  Uud  to  promote \neconomic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty resulting from inadequate transport services \nand  high costs.  Logistics  development  in  Zamyn Uud  is  part  of the  program for  the  integrated \ndevelopment  of  a free  economic zone in this  poor region,  which  shares borders  with the  PRC \nand is the main gateway for Mongolia\u2019s trade with the PRC and other parts of the world. \n \nAnother  intervention  is  the  Customs  Modernization  Project, 12  which  aims  to  finance \n22. \n(i) the  establishment  of  the  Mongolian  customs  automated  information  system;  (ii)  the \nimprovement  of  infrastructure  at  major  customs  houses  and  customs  border  posts;  and \n(iii) institutional  strengthening,  including  business  process  reengineering,  capacity  building  in \nrelation  to  the  above  two  components,  interagency  coordination,  regional  cooperation,  and \npublic\u2013private  partnerships.  The  expected  impact  is  increased  volume  and  efficiency  of \nMongolia\u2019s international trade.  \n  \n23. \nThese  ADB  interventions  will  form  the  foundation  for  the  development  of  the  proposed \nproject, which will complement the Zamyn Uud Project by facilitating transportation of Mongolian \nproducts requiring a temperature-controlled environment and facilitate trade in new markets. In \nfood safety, the project will contribute to establishing a platform for proper storage of perishable \ngoods. The lessons learned from previous operations include the importance that needs to be \nattributed  to  (i)  rigorous  analysis  of  the  transaction  financials,  including  stress  testing  of  the \ndemand projections to factor in potential market disruptions; (ii)  a clear review of the sponsors \ninvolved in the transaction; and (iii) clear awareness of the parties involved. \n \n\n                                                \n9   ADB. 2006.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE. \n \n24. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements13 \n\n \nAspects \nManagement \n\nImplementation \nperiod \nConstruction \narrangements \n\nRevenue \nstructure \n\nCost structure \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nArrangements \nTCCL is set up by TBTL as a joint venture project company in cooperation with \nKamigumi and Toyota. TBTL will retain a majority stake in TCCL and will retain (i) \ncontrol over management policy; (ii) budget, financial, and accounting procedures; \nand (iii) control of the board, and major project board resolutions. TBTL, Toyota, and \nKamigumi will appoint key management positions (e.g., general manager, financial \ncontroller, and chief engineer) depending on each shareholder\u2019s expertise. \n\nQ4 2012\u2013Q4 2013 \n\nThe engineering, procurement and construction contract was awarded on 6 July 2011 \nto China Railway Construction 18th Bureau Group. The specifications of the contract \ninclude the construction of the Cold Storage Warehouse No. 1 with an area of \n28,974.07 m2; 3,801.71 m2 of cargo handling space; and 1,433.60 m2 of refrigeration \nroom and transformer room, situated at Tianjin Port Container Logistics Center.  \nThe revenue stream is based on three major areas: storage, transport, and \ninspection. For all goods coming into the inspection process, fees are charged for \ntransport in and out of the compound, storage, loading and unloading, as well as \nvalue-added services such as sorting, labeling, and plastic wrapping. The fee \nstructure is based on market standards and reflects full cost recovery of the \noperational expenditures. \nThe cost structure is straightforward for the cold storage operations. Aside from staff \ncosts (42.5% of total operational cost), electricity is the primary source of expenditure \n(21.2%). Other costs include water supply, drainage, and heating but account for less \nthan 1% of the total operational cost. \nTCCL will submit to ADB quarterly unaudited financial statements, annual audited \nfinancial statements, and environmental and social monitoring reports. The indicators \nare in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  m2  =  square  meter,  Q  =  quarter,  TBTL  =  Tianjin  Binhai  TEDA  Logistics, \nTCCL = Tedahang Cold Chain Logistics. \n \nF. \n \n25. \nThe project is financially viable because  the expected financial internal rate of return  is \nhigher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.14 The  project  is  economically  sustainable  as \nthe economic internal rate of return is higher than the social discount rate of 10%.15 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n                                                \n13 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n14  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 The  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group\u2019s  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations  rates  a \n\nproject satisfactory if the economic internal rate of return is 10% or higher. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  for  up  to  CNY150  million  will  be  funded  through  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \ncapital resources without government guarantee.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n \n27. \nTBTL saw  in  ADB  not  just  a  source  of financing for  a  relatively  nascent  industry  in the \nPRC but more importantly, an alliance in creating high standards for logistics as well as setting \nthe  policy  framework  at  the  central  level.  ADB  has  assisted  the  central  government  in \nstrengthening the national food safety regulatory and strategic framework through TA approved \nin  2004  and  completed  in  2007,  whereby  high-level  meetings  have  been  conducted  to  help \ndevelop  more  consistent  regulation  for  food  safety  (footnote  10).  TBTL  sees  ADB\u2019s  access  to \nthe central government as an invaluable asset in promoting the establishment of benchmarks on \nlogistics handling and quality control. \n \n28. \n\nFurthermore, ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following: \n\nFacilitating  dialogue  for  regional  trade  facilitation  and  integration  of  the  logistics \nnetwork between the PRC and Mongolia and under the broader framework of the \nCAREC. \nEncouraging  the  adoption  of  a  structured  framework  to  manage  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguard  concerns,  which  may  become  the  benchmark  for  the \nsector in the PRC. \nEnhancing  best  practices  in  corporate  governance  of  TCCL  in  maintaining \ntransparency and disclosure. \nProviding  financing  at  a  longer  tenure  to  ensure  a  proper  match  between  the \nproject cash flows and the debt service obligations. \n\nRisks will include credit, market, regulatory, and operational risks. \n\nGuarantor  risk. The full guarantee of TBTL is crucial to the overall credit of the \ntransaction,  making  it  essential  to  confirm  TBTL\u2019s  capacity  as  guarantor.    Due \ndiligence  confirmed  TBTL\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  business  strategies  and  its \nhistorical  track  record  to  diversify  or  consolidate  businesses  to  preserve  its \nfinancial integrity.  However, it is critical for TBTL to retain their capacity to deliver \non  their  full  and  unconditional  guarantee  on  the  project.  Covenants  in  the \nfinancing  documents  will  be  included  to  ensure  and  preserve  the  financial \nintegrity of the guarantor over the life of the loan. \n \nMarket  risk.    Due  diligence  covered  an  assessment  of  critical  factors  driving \nmarket  risk,  e.g.,  project  industry\u2019s  barriers  to  entry;  uniqueness  of  TCCL\u2019s \nservice  to  the  customs  clearance  process;  key  drivers  for  revenue  generation; \nand  the  tariff  structure.    The  project\u2019s  main  advantage  is  its  proximity  to  the \nTianjin port, which serves 17 provinces with a population of over 600 million, and \nwhere  some  400,000  tons  of frozen meats  pass  through,  comprising  15%  of  all \n\n \nC. \n \n29. \n\nRisks  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nfrozen meat consumed in the PRC. The tariff structure is expected to be market-\nbased  and  not  heavily  regulated  with  likely  provisions  for  the  pass-through  of \nvariable costs.  \n\nRegulatory  risk.  Due diligence evaluated the level of government support and \ncollaboration between TCCL and the Customs and the Inspection Bureau (CIQ).  \nThe  CIQ  and  other  relevant  government  agencies  demonstrated  significant \nsupport for this project, which is in line with national development and food safety \npriorities. TCCL has also formed a symbiotic partnership with the CIQ in Tianjin, \nthe  primary  government  agency  to  utilize  this  facility.  CIQ  deems  TCCL  as  an \ninvaluable  partner  and  values  the  project  for  its  proximity  to  the  port  and  its \ncontributions to increased efficiency of the inspection process. \n\nOperations and maintenance risk. The on-site presence of Toyota Tsusho and \nKamigumi  as  early  as  3  months  before  the  project\u2019s  scheduled  commercial \noperations  indicates  that  both  sponsors,  equipped  with  cold  chain  and  systems \nmanagement expertise, are taking active roles in project development. Kamigumi \nbrings  substantial  expertise  in  cold  chain  management,  tested  and  proven \nthrough operational challenges experienced during the Kobe earthquake and the \n2011 tsunami in Japan.  Toyota Tsusho\u2019s experience in systems management is \nalso expected to be an asset to project operations.  To ensure continuous power \navailability,  the  project  is  connected  to  two  substations  within  the  Tianjin  port, \nincluding one substation that supports storage of highly sensitive chemicals and \nis considered a priority station in the event of power rationing.    \n\nCompletion  risk.  Construction of phase 1 is well under way, within budget, and \nexpected  to  be  completed  by  Q3  2012.    Engineering,  procurement  and \nconstruction  (EPC)  requirements  for  phase  2  have  also  been  prepared  for \ntendering and construction will begin end 2012. Construction design took 2 years \nto complete and have been vetted by Japanese and European consultants while \nconstruction  and  technology  design  is  overseen  by  Kamigumi  and  Toyota \nTsusho.  The  EPC  contractor  has  tested  capability  in  civil  works  with  an \nenforceable EPC contract under PRC regulation.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n30. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \nunder category B for environment, category C for involuntary resettlement, and category C for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  located  in  an  industrial  and  logistics  zone  sited  far  from \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  and  receptors.  Environmental  impacts  mainly  involved  dust, \nnoise,  and  vibration  generation  during  construction,  which  are  minimized \nthrough \nimplementation of water sprinkling and cleaning system, use of low-noise powered mechanical \nequipment and hydraulic pile drivers. Domestic and construction solid wastes are collected and \ndelivered  to  designated  off-site  disposal  locations.  During  operation,  the  risk  from  the  use  of \nammonia  as  a  refrigerant  is  minimized  and  mitigated  as  fugitive  emissions  are  expected  to \ncomply with the national ambient air quality standard and ammonia will be stored in appropriate \ncylinders  situated  in  restricted  entry  refrigerant  rooms.  An  explosive-proof  fan  and  ammonia \ndetector will also be installed, emergency response procedures will be in place, and staff will be \nproperly  trained  and  provided  with  personal  protective  equipment.  The  land  where  the  project \nwill  be  constructed  covers  76,795.8  square meters  (m2)  and  is  under  the  name  of  TCCL.  The \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nland right period from the state is until 14 January 2060. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, an initial environmental examination has been prepared and the borrower has \ncommitted  to  implement  the  environmental  management  plan  and  submit  periodic  monitoring \nreports  to  ADB.  The  project  will  not  have  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people \nimpacts during construction and operation, as confirmed during the due diligence site visit. \n \n31. \nThe  project  has  coordinated  with  the  adjacent  companies  and  other  stakeholders, \nsecured local clearances and endorsements, and established a grievance redress mechanism. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  TCCL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. TCCL and its contractors will comply with ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Strategy  and  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  their  compliance  with  national  labor \nlaws  and  adherence  to core  labor  standards.16 The  project  has  no  gender  element  features  in \nthe project design. \n \nB. \n \nTCCL  and  TBTL  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international \n32. \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance.  \n \nC. \n \n33. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \n34. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC\u2019s  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  TCCL  will  be  obtained. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nAssurances \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n35. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \nCNY150,000,000.00  to  Tedahang  Cold  Chain  Logistics  for  the  Tianjin  Cold  Chain  Logistics \nFacility  Development  Project  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2003.
