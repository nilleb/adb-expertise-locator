THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support \nProgram  (CARES  program),  under  the  countercyclical  support  facility  COVID-19  pandemic \nresponse option (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a devastating health, social, and \neconomic impact on the Philippines. As of 15 April 2020, there were 5,453 confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 in the Philippines and 349 deaths, with only 45,486 tests processed in comparison with \na much larger number of tests in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Philippines \nis one of the first developing countries globally and the first in Southeast Asia to introduce strict \nquarantine measures in order to limit spread of the disease, including in Luzon which represents \napproximately 50% of the country\u2019s population and 70% of economic activity.  While critical from \na health perspective, social isolation measures will have a negative impact on growth. The \ngovernment estimates that gross domestic product (GDP) growth could decline to -1.0% for 2020, \nfrom the originally projected increase of 6.2%.2  \n \n3.  Livelihoods have also been adversely affected, with unemployment in Luzon expected to \nspike from 5.0% to 22.0% in the second quarter, creating 4.3 million additional unemployed before \nleveling off to 9.2% by June 2021. The real sector has been devastated as most businesses are \nunable to operate. A sharp decline in tourism arrivals and massive disruptions to global supply \nchains are also hurting the economy. An additional 5.5 million Filipinos are expected to fall into \npoverty, with poverty incidence estimated to jump from 16.6% in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020. \n \n4.  These shocks severely impact the government\u2019s fiscal position and give rise to urgent \nnear-term financing needs. Government revenues for the first half of 2020 are projected to decline \nby $8 billion (or 23.4%) relative to the original targets, and an additional $23 billion in spending \nwill be required to fund the government\u2019s initial crisis response. As a result, overall financing needs \nwill reach record levels, with the government requiring close to $40 billion for 2020. The needs \nare immediate and pressing, with a negative $10.2 billion cashflow anticipated for the second \nquarter of 2020. Liquidity in the domestic bond market is also constrained, as corporates react to \nheightened uncertainty by increasing their cash holdings. \n \n5.  The CARES program, under the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse Option (CPRO) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will provide critically needed \nsupport  to  help  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  mitigate the severe  health,  social,  and \neconomic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s support will allow the government \nto undertake public expenditures that are essential for supporting vulnerable populations and \ncurtailing spread of the disease.  \n \n6.  The Philippines meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption  (CPRO)  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF),  which  include  robust \nmacroeconomic management, undertaking of key structural reforms, a pro-poor countercyclical \nexpenditure program, and public debt levels maintained at sustainable levels (Table 1).3 The \nCARES program is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, including operational priorities on \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2  The Asian Development Outlook projects GDP growth in the Philippines to be 2.0% in 2020. The International \nMonetary Fund projects GDP growth in the Philippines to be 0.6% in 2020 (IMF. 2020. World Economic Outlook: The \nGreat Lockdown. Washington.)  \n3  Details on compliance with the access criteria are in Appendix 4. ", "2 \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Adverse impact of  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government expects GDP growth in \nexogenous shocks  the Philippines to fall to -1.0% in 2020 against the original estimate of 6.2%, \nwith employment loss projected at more than 4 million. This could push the \neconomy into recession for the first time since the 1997 Asian financial \ncrisis. Gross financing requirements have reached record levels due to the \ncrisis. Growing uncertainty in financial markets is constraining liquidity \noptions for the government. \n2. Countercyclical  The  government  announced  a  \u20b1655.6  billion  ($12.8  billion)  pro-poor \ndevelopment  counter-cyclical expenditure program with focus on social protection for the \nexpenditures  vulnerable, scaling up resources for the health sector, protecting critical \npublic spending, and providing economic stimulus. About 31% of the \npackage, $4 billion, will be in the form of emergency cash assistance for \nthe poor and vulnerable households. \n3. Pre-shock record of  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy expanded by 6.3% on \nsound macroeconomic  average during 2010\u20132019. Inflation had been carefully managed and was \nmanagement  only 2.5% in 2019. Tax reforms had increased the tax-to-GDP ratio from \n13.6% in 2015 to 15.2% in 2019. Fiscal deficit averaged only 2.8% between \n2016-2019. \n4. Structural reforms   The Philippines has taken several concrete and credible steps to contain \nthe spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the social and economic impact on \nthe population (Table 4, Box 1-3). It has collaborated closely with the World \nHealth Organization. The government imposed an enhanced community \nquarantine over the entire island of Luzon and was the first to introduce \nsuch decisive measures in Southeast Asia. It announced a \u20b135.8 billion \n($0.7 billion) health response package. As presented in Table 4, besides \nsupport for the health sector, the government\u2019s response package has 4 \ndistinct blocks of support focused on social assistance, small business \nrelief,  poor  farmers,  and  local  governments.  The  government  has \nestablished an Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging \nInfectious  Diseases  to  coordinate  implementation  of  their  COVID-19 \nresponses. \n5. Debt sustainability  Central government debt fell from 52.4% of GDP to 38.9% of GDP between  \n2010\u20132019. Additional borrowing under the CPRO has minimal (0.4%) \nimpact on debt\u2013GDP ratio, with recovery to almost pre-crisis levels by \n2024. \n6. Coordination with the  ADB is in close contact with the IMF on macroeconomic monitoring, \nInternational Monetary  especially  related  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n7.  We are in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic. In December 2019, \nresidents of Wuhan in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) were diagnosed with a previously \nunknown coronavirus. Since then, COVID-19 has spread quickly across the world and on  \n11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global \n ", "3 \npandemic. As of 15 April 2020, more than 2.0 million cases were confirmed across 185 countries \nand territories, resulting in more than 134,000 deaths.4 In contrast, the 2002 severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) global outbreak resulted in 813 deaths, and the 2012 middle-east \nrespiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in 858 deaths.5 The COVID-19 pandemic is also \nseverely impacting the global economy, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects to \ngo into recession in 2020.6  \n \n8.  Philippines health system is under heavy stress.  COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in the \nPhilippines. The government confirmed the first case on 30 January 2020. After almost a month \nof limited activity, cases have begun to grow exponentially, from seven confirmed cases on  \n9 March 2020 to 5,453 confirmed cases (with about 50% in the National Capital Region [NCR]) \nand 349 deaths as of 15 April 2020. Confirmed cases had been doubling approximately every  \n3\u20134 days in March 2020, while the pace has slowed somewhat in April 2020.7 Assuming a basic \nreproduction number (R ) between 1.5 to 4, the University of the Philippines COVID-19 Pandemic \n0\nResponse  Team  predicts  that  the  cumulative  number  of  infected  individuals  (including \nasymptomatic individuals and unreported cases) could increase from approximately 750,000 to \n1.7 million, with 75% of these located in the NCR. Without effective interventions, cases in Metro \nManila are expected to peak between April and June 2020.8 \n \n9.  The growing number of confirmed cases and persons under investigation (PUI) place a \nheavy strain on the Philippine health system.9 Global shortages of supplies initially constrained \nthe government\u2019s testing capacity to just 450 tests per day, making it difficult to track the spread \nof the virus. While treatment and infection control protocols are evolving, increased vigilance \nagainst transmission to health workers rapidly depleted stocks of personal protective equipment \n(PPE). The care of each confirmed case and PUI requires the use of at least 30 sets of disposable \nPPE a day. This also affects the ability of health workers to attend to non-COVID-19 patients, and \nincreases their risk of COVID-19 infection, further straining the health system. \n \n10.  Treatment capacity for COVID-19 patients was also limited by shortages of hospital beds \n(1 bed per 984 people), doctors (1 per 2,000 people), and ventilators. Unofficial estimates suggest \njust 1,500 installed ventilators nationwide, with approximately 500 in the NCR. The Philippines \nhas 2.2 critical care beds with ventilators per 100,000 people, which is low relative to ASEAN \npeers (Table 2). Shortages are likely to be exacerbated as many countries look to increase stocks \nof these essential items. \n \nTable 2: Summary Comparison of COVID-19 Related Data and Effects \nTests \nNo. of  Poverty \nprocessed  Critical  GDP  Announced \ncases  Job  estimates \nper 1 million  care  forecasta/  stimulus \nCountry  (as of  losses  (pre-/post-\npopulation   beds/  fiscal  package  \n15 April  (million)  COVID-19; \n(as of 15 April  100,000  deficit (%)  ($ billion) \n2020)  (%) \n2020) \nIndonesia  5,136      132      2.7  0.5/-5.1  7  9.4/11.9\u201312.8  32.4 \nMalaysia  5,072   2,694      3.4  -2.0/-4.7  2.4  0.4/NA  60.3 \nPhilippines  5,453      415      2.2  -1.0/-5.3  4.3  16.6/20.7  12.8 \n \n4  Johns Hopkins University. 2020.

COVID-19 has severe economic consequences. On 13 March 2020, the government \nenforced enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) measures to control the spread of the virus\u2014\nfirst  for  the  NCR  and  subsequently  for  the  entire  island  of  Luzon,  effective  until  \n30 April 2020. The Philippines was the first country in Southeast Asia and the third country in the \nworld to introduce dramatic steps in order to control the spread of the virus. While ECQ is \nexpected to save lives and flatten the pandemic curve, it causes economic hardship. Luzon\u2019s \neconomy will contract in March and April 2020. A sharp decline in Philippines economic growth is \nexpected from 5.9% in 2019 to -1.0% in 2020, pulling the economy into recession for the first time \nsince the 1990s. \n \n12.  Household consumption and investment are also contracting. Domestic consumption has \ndecreased, with consumption of nonessential commodities expected to fall by 5%\u201310% for 2020, \na  loss  of  \u20b194  billion  or  0.5%  of  GDP.  The  Purchasing  Managers  Index,  an  indicator  of \nmanufacturing performance, fell from 52.1 in January 2020 to 39.7 in March 2020, an all-time low. \nFactory shutdowns have led to a sharp drop in production. The country\u2019s three largest cement \nmanufacturers temporarily shut down their factories and distribution operations in Luzon. Micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have been severely affected, as sales fall and \ncash  reserves  are  depleted.  MSMEs  comprised  63%  of  the  country\u2019s  employment  among \nregistered establishments in 2018, with about a third of the employment in microenterprises. Half \nof the MSME jobs are in Luzon, with a high concentration (58%) registered by women.10 \n \n13.  The pandemic has severely affected tourism and international trade. In February 2020, \ntourist arrivals declined 40% year-on-year. This contraction is expected to double in March and \nApril 2020.11 Conservative estimates project a decline of up to \u20b1118 billion or 0.7% of GDP in \ntourism revenues in 2020 (footnote 11). International trade has also been disrupted. Total exports \nto PRC have fallen by more than 50% since the beginning of 2020.12 Electronics, representing \n55% of total exports, have been highly affected by supply chain disruptions. Exports from special \neconomic zones declined by over 66% to $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, from $12.9 billion \nin the first quarter of 2019. MSMEs, estimated to represent 60% of exporting firms, have been \nparticularly affected. \n \n14.  Finance and corporate sector risks are elevated. The crisis has brought nonbank \ncapital markets in the Philippines to a virtual standstill. The Philippine Stock Exchange\u2019s main \nindex declined 41% from the start of 2020 through mid-March, erasing more than \u20b11 trillion in \n \n10 Philippine Statistics Authority. 2020. 2020 FactSheet of Women and Men.

Nonperforming loans are expected to increase, although the rapid onset of the crisis \nmakes accurate measurement challenging. As of the end of January 2020, the banking system \nreported lending concentrations in manufacturing (10% of total loans), wholesale and retail trade \n(12% of total loans), and real estate activities (12% of total loans). These exposures total  \n\u20b14.2 trillion. Fitch Ratings recently assessed the direct sector exposure of banking systems in the \nPhilippines and found that the highest exposure risks stem from large corporations including \nairlines, construction, and other key industries that the pandemic affects directly.15 The spread on \n10-year Philippine government bonds relative to United States (US) government bonds has \nincreased by almost 200 basis points, reflecting underlying vulnerabilities (Figure 1). \n \n \nFigure 1: Challenging Conditions for the Financial Sector  \n \n5-year Credit Default Swap Philippines 10-year Yield Spread to US \nTreasury\n160\n450\n140\ns\ntnioP110200 stnio345000\n sisa 6800 P sis300\nB 40 aB250\n20 200\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  99 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 11 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22\n/72/21 02/01/1 /71/1 /42/1 /13/1 02/70/2 /41/2 /12/2 /82/2 02/60/3 /31/3 /02/3 /72/3 /72/21/21/72 02/30/1/1/3 02/01/1/1/01 /71/1/1/71 /42/1/1/42 /13/1/1/13 02/70/2/2/7 /41/2/2/41 /12/2/2/12 /82/2/2/82 02/60/3/3/6 /31/3/3/31 /02/3/3/02 /72/3/3/72\n0 0 0   0 0 0 0\n \nUS = United States. \nNote: Format of dates is day/month/year.    \nSource: Philippine Stock Exchange; and Asia Bonds Online.

The ECQ, while necessary to control the spread of COVID-19, is dramatically \naffecting employment in Luzon and other urban centers. Of the NCR\u2019s 5.4 million workers, \napproximately 79% are engaged in the services sector, where the impact is severe. Work from \nhome arrangements are not amenable to wholesale, retail, accommodation, food service, and \ntransport jobs, which account for 39.8% or 2.1 million workers in the NCR. Women represent \napproximately 60% of the wholesale and retail trade sector employment and are particularly \naffected.16 ADB projects that the unemployment rate in Luzon will increase from 5.3% in October \n2019 to 22% in the second quarter of 2020, creating 4.3 million additional unemployed. Non-\nregular workers in hotels, restaurants and retail, and manufacturing are likely to be laid off, while \nmany regular workers in the services sector are likely to be put on unpaid leave.

Informal sector workers, accounting for approximately 30% of all Luzon employment, are \nhighly vulnerable to livelihood disruptions from the pandemic. In 2017, there were 39 million \nwomen working in the informal economy. These workers are more likely to be exposed to unsafe \nworking conditions, limited security of tenure, lower and irregular income, and limited workers\u2019 \nrights.17 Women also lose opportunities as unpaid care work has increased, with children out of \nschool and elevated care needs of elderly and infirm. Women and girls also earn less, save less, \nand are more likely to hold insecure jobs, compounding the economic impacts of the pandemic.18 \n \nFigure 2: Dramatic Expected Rise in Unemployment Rates in Luzon \n25.0\ne\nta 20.0\nR\n tn 15.0\ne\nm\n10.0\ny\no\nlp 5.0\nm\ne\nn 0.0\nU\n % 2019Q4 2020Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020Q4 2021Q1 2021Q2\nUnem (pre-Covid) Unem (Covid)\n \nQ = quarter. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. These estimates are based on the assumptions that \nnon-regular workers in \u2018high contact-intensive\u2019 jobs in services and manufacturing are laid off first as \na result of the Luzon enhanced community quarantine, with a subsequent fall in household spending \nand investment. The simulations assume (i) economic growth of -2.0% for 2020 and economic growth \nof 6.5% for 2021, and (ii) employment elasticity of 0.6 and labor force growth of 2.6% in 2020 and \n2021.  \n \n18.

Poverty reduction trends could be reversed. The government reduced poverty from \n23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018 through a combination of sustained economic growth, job creation, \nand social assistance programs. The number of poor individuals fell from 23.5 million in 2015 to \n17.6 million in 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic could reverse these gains. ADB projects that \nwithout substantial fiscal support to poor and vulnerable families, poverty incidence could increase \nfrom 16.6% in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020. This equates to 5.5 million more Filipinos falling into poverty, \na 68.6% increase in the NCR and a 31.3% increase nationally. Assuming economic growth \nreturns to its long-term trend in 2021, there is a risk that poverty incidence would only decrease \nto 20.2% by the end of 2021, reflecting the lasting effects of the pandemic (Figure 3). \n \n \n17 Government of the Philippines, Philippine Institute for Development Studies. 2019.

The pandemic is creating significant fiscal pressure through several channels. First, \ndisruptions  to  business  and  economic  shocks  are  critically  impacting  government  revenue \ncollections. Weaker domestic business activity and slower imports will reduce revenues and \nwiden the 2020 budget deficit to 5.3% of GDP, from an originally programmed 3.2%. These \nestimates exclude the cost of the recovery plan. Conservative estimates suggest that if the \npandemic continues until June 2020, revenue collections could be \u20b1500 billion lower than the \ngovernment\u2019s target of \u20b13.5 trillion for 2020. An extended tax-filing deadline will also delay \ncollections of approximately \u20b1145 billion. Second, additional public spending on core public \nservices (including medical care, social protection, and economic support) is necessary to \nrespond to the crisis. Third, fiscal pressures will be sharpest during the second and third quarters \nof 2020, when a large fiscal imbalance is expected. The government will borrow a record  \n\u20b11.9 trillion in 2020, with the greatest need falling in the second quarter. \n \nTable 3: Fiscal Position  \n(\u20b1 billion) \n2020  2020  %  % Change (2020 \n2019  pre- post- Change  pre- vs post-\n   COVID  COVID  (yoy)  COVID) \nRevenues  3,173.5  3,492.0  2,995.6    (5.6%)  (14.2%) \nExpenditures  3,814.8  4,163.0  4,185.6    9.7%    0.5% \n   Operating  3,051.8  3,340.0  3,522.9      15.4%    5.5% \n   Capital     745.9     813.0     652.7     (12.5%)  (19.7%) \n   Net lending       17.1       10.0       10.0     (41.5%)    0.0% \nOff-budget transfers from   \nGOCCs         200.0   \n           54.4% \nBalance  (641.3)  (671.0)     (990.0)   47.5% \n( ) = negative, COVID = coronavirus disease, GOCC = government-owned and controlled corporation, Q = quarter, yoy \n= year-on-year.  \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding. \nSources: Asian Development Bank calculations. \n \n21.  The government has mounted a rapid and robust crisis response. On 15 March 2020, \nthe government announced a COVID-19 response strategy, with several priority actions to \naddress the negative impacts of the  pandemic and combat the spread of COVID-19. The \ngovernment established the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious \nDiseases (IATF-EID) to provide overall policy guidance on containing COVID-19. The IATF-EID \n ", "8 \nis headed by the Department of Health (DOH), and comprises the Department of Foreign Affairs, \nthe Department of Interior and Local Government, the Department of Labor and Employment, and \nother  key  agencies.  Specific  measures  under  the  response  strategy  include:  (i) enhanced \nquarantine to reduce the infection rate; (ii) expanded medical services to step up testing and care \nfor affected populations; (iii) social protection and livelihood support to help mitigate the immediate \nimpacts on livelihoods and employment; and (iv) broader fiscal stimulus to support the economy \nand speed up recovery. The response package is estimated at \u20b1655.6 billion ($12.8 billion, or \n3.6% of GDP) (Table 4). The fiscal impact of the stimulus packages can be significant in restarting \ngrowth in the economy due to the multiplier effects of its spending and tax relief components. \nPreliminary estimates by ADB show that the overall impact of the response could lead to a \ncumulative increase in real GDP of $15.2 billion after one year, and $17.2 billion after two years, \nequivalent to 4.2% and 4.8% of GDP, respectively.20 \n \nTable 4: Government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program \nProgram  Description  Amount   Amount \n(\u20b1 million)  ($ million) \n1.

Health sector support will be significantly increased. In 2020, the health sector budget \nwas \u20b1175.8 billion (4.3% of the national budget), of which \u20b1104.4 billion was for the DOH. The \ngovernment has announced a \u20b135.8 billion health sector package to respond to the pandemic. \nThese  funds  will  help  improve  capacity  and  staffing  for  COVID-19  testing  at  subnational \nlaboratories,  purchase  PPEs  and  supplies  for  testing,  improve  rapid  response  screening \ncapabilities, scale up facilities and cover operating costs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, \nand cover medical expenses of patients and health personnel. Additionally, an Inter-Agency \nContingency Plan for Emerging Infectious Diseases and COVID-19 was released on 28 February \n2020. Key health sector priorities include: (i) increasing the country\u2019s diagnostic capacity to \ndetermine the presence of COVID-19 in patients; (ii) enhancing infection control measures in \nhospitals and other health facilities; (iii) expanding the treatment capacity for COVID-19 cases; \n(iv) mobilizing financing for health care providers from the DOH, Philippine Health Insurance \nCorporation,  local  governments,  and  other  sources;  and  (v)  implementing  risk  and  other \ncommunication interventions. \n \n23.  Non-health-facilities including the Philippine International Convention Center and the \nPhilippine Arena are being converted into quarantine zones for the growing number of mild \nCOVID-19 cases, PUIs, and recovered patients undergoing home quarantine. Molecular analysis \nhas been brought online with eight government and three private laboratories, increasing testing \ncapacity to 3,000 per day. The government plans to increase testing capacity to at least 8,000 \ntests a day in May 2020 by upgrading additional private and government labs. To rationalize the \nuse of hospital beds, doctors, and critical care beds, three major government NCR hospitals were \ndesignated as exclusive hospitals for COVID-19 cases. The designation of COVID-19 facilities \n ", "10 \nwill free additional capacity in other hospitals to support non-COVID-19 cases. The DOH plans to \nprocure  1,000  additional  ventilators,  with  more  to  follow.  The  Philippine  Health  Insurance \nCorporation has begun paying hospitalization costs of COVID-19 cases, particularly for frontline \nhealth workers. These measures are aimed at flattening the curve; the rate of confirmed cases \ndoubling has begun to fall, from 3\u20134 days in March 2020 to 6\u20137 days in April 2020. However, it is \nimportant to reflect that the Philippines has processed a relatively small number of COVID-19 \ntests (33,814 as of 14 April 2020) compared with other countries in the region. Box 1 provides \nadditional detail. In addition to national measures, the Philippines has also committed to regional \nsharing of data and lessons learned.21  \n \n24.  The government has rolled out wide-ranging countercyclical support measures. \nThese measures are intended to address the effects of the pandemic and protect critical public \nexpenditures. The government\u2019s non-health response package totals \u20b1619.8 billion. Focus areas \ninclude:  \n \n(i)  Immediate increase in social assistance. On 25 March 2020, Congress passed \nthe Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, providing the President with emergency powers \nto reallocate budgeted funds and access off-budget funds for the government\u2019s \ncrisis response. Chief among these is a \u20b1205 billion Emergency Subsidy Program \n(ESP) providing unconditional cash transfers (Box 2). This complements other \nsocial  protection  and  income  support  measures  to  help  vulnerable  workers \nweather the crisis, including financial assistance to displaced and vulnerable \nworkers, unemployment benefits, support for repatriated overseas Filipino workers, \nand scholarships and skills development for displaced workers. \n \nBox 1: Stepping up the Health Response \n \nThe government has taken urgent action to rapidly address the health impacts of the pandemic, \nincluding both prevention and treatment. Immediate priorities include the following. \nMeasure  Description \nPreparedness  The plan details: (i) clinical management of severe and critical cases; (ii) infection prevention \nplan  and control among health workers and general population; and (iii) specimen management \nand laboratory confirmation to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. \nSocial distancing  Community quarantine was initially imposed in NCR on 15 March 2020 followed by an ECQ \nfor the whole of Luzon the following day. A number of local governments from Visayas and \nMindanao also imposed community quarantine. The ECQ banned mass gatherings and \ntemporary closed schools, workplaces, religious activities, and public transport. People may \nstill travel to fulfill basic needs such as going to the supermarket or pharmacy. \nTesting  There are now 11 molecular labs capable of processing up to 3,000 tests a day. More than \n100,000 tests kits were donated and local production of PCR test kits by the UP-National \nInstitutes of Health has been initiated. \nRepurposing and  The government designated three COVID-19 only hospitals in NCR (UP-Philippine General \nbuilding of  Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, and Jose Rodriguez Memorial Hospital) and 55 \nfacilities  other COVID-19 referral hospitals, repurposed several convention centers, stadiums, and \nother facilities into temporary health facilities that would house suspect and mild COVID-19 \ncases. The government purchased a million new sets of PPEs and is working with industry \nassociations and local firms for the local production of 10,000 sets of PPEs a day. \nDomestic and  The government stopped all domestic air and sea travel to and from Luzon and restricted \ninternational  travel to the Philippines by all foreigners with few exceptions. \ntravel restrictions \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, ECQ = enhanced community quarantine, NCR = National Capital Region, PCR = polymerase \nchain reaction, PPE = personal protective equipment, UP = University of the Philippines. \nSource: Government of the Philippines, Department of Health. \n  \n \n21 ASEAN. 2020.

The government has planned a major relief \nprogram to support small businesses, which play an important role in both the \neconomy and employment in the Philippines. Relief measures include a wage \nsubsidy for small-businesses covering up to 3.4 million employees in the formal \nsector, a credit guarantee facility to help more than 1.5 million small businesses \naccess loans, tax relief for 1.5 million small businesses, and a financing program \nthrough the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure small businesses are able \nto meet cashflow needs during the crisis. Box 3 provides additional details. \n \nBox 3: Wage Subsidies for Small Businesses \n \nThe government has established the Small Business Wage Subsidy Program (SBWSP) to provide \ncritical relief to small businesses and their employees. Approximately 436,000 small businesses have \ntemporarily closed, another 1,000,000 are operating on a skeletal workforce, and only 117,666 small \nbusinesses have remained open. Drawing on best international practice, the Philippines is the first \ndeveloping member  country to establish such  a scheme specifically to address the COVID-19 \npandemic impact on employment. The scheme has two objectives. First, to incentivize businesses to \nremain attached to their employees for rapid resumption of operations after the crisis. Second, to \nprovide income stability, allowing Filipino workers to manage during the ECQ. The scheme is budgeted \nat $1.0 billion and targets 1.5 million small businesses employing 3.4 million workers. The program is \nadministered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Social Security System (SSS). Under \nthe scheme small businesses apply online for the wage subsidy on behalf of their employees. \nBusinesses registered with BIR and SSS (covering about 2.6 million workers) will be prioritized for \nfunding under the scheme, followed by non-registered businesses. The monthly subsidy is fixed \nbetween \u20b15,000 and \u20b18,000 per employee and paid for two months. The SSS will credit the wage \nsubsidy directly to the employee\u2019s bank account upon notifying both the employee and the employer. \n   \n ", "12 \n(iii)  Support  for  agriculture  and  other  economic  sectors.  The  government  is \nproviding targeted assistance to affected and vulnerable sectors. This includes \nfinancial  assistances  to  farmers  including  resiliency  support  and  other  crop \nproduction products targeting increased production, interest-free financing for \nfarmers for up to \u20b125,000, and additional funding to boost emergency buffer stocks \nfor rice. \n \n(iv)  Local  government  support.  The  government  has  also  empowered  local \ngovernments  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  constituents  during the crisis.  This \nincludes significant additional budget transfers to local governments to support \nprograms for vulnerable communities and sectors, and emergency loans to local \ngovernments from the Philippines Landbank to support urgent spending needs. \n \n25.  As part of its COVID-19 response strategy, the government is also raising additional \nfinancing to fund the emergency initiatives and the economic stimulus. It accessed short-term \nfinancing amounting to \u20b1300 billion from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the \nPhilippines [BSP]). It is planning to secure additional financing of \u20b1310 billion from multilateral \nand bilateral sources. \n \n26.  BSP has put in place a range of monetary policy measures. In February 2020, the \nBSP undertook a preemptive interest rate cut of 25 basis points, followed by an additional cut of \n50 basis points on 19 March 2020. This brings the overnight reverse repurchase rate to 3.25% to \nreduce the cost of borrowing and cushion the shock to the economy. Overnight deposit rates were \nreduced  to  2.75%  and  lending  rates  were  cut  to  3.75%  on  20  March  2020.  The  reserve \nrequirement ratio of universal and commercial banks was also reduced by 200 basis points \neffective 30 March 2020. These actions have infused around \u20b1220 billion of liquidity into the \nsystem. Inflation is forecast to slow relative to 2019 and is expected to fall within the government\u2019s \n2%\u20134% target range. \n \n27.  Finance sector risks are being managed. On 14 March 2020, the BSP published a \nmemorandum on regulatory relief for BSP-supervised financial institutions affected by COVID-\n19.22 This was followed by a second policy relief package issued on 19 March 2020.23 Together \nthese packages provide relief to both wholesale and retail stakeholders. At the wholesale level, \nthe BSP adopted measures to increase the flow of liquidity to the banking system and the \ncountry\u2019s largest conglomerates. The single borrower limit has been temporarily increased and \nconditions on the use of the BSP\u2019s rediscount facility have been relaxed. At the retail level, the \nBSP encouraged banks to keep lending to borrowers by temporarily encouraging restructuring \nand  forbearance  for  affected  borrowers. In  addition,  the  BSP  has  temporarily  waived  the \napplication of past-due status for affected borrowers and is allowing a phased buildup of the \nallowance for loan losses over time. Finally, routine documentary and filing requirements have \nbeen streamlined or curtailed. \n \n28.  There has been a sound record of macroeconomic management leading up to the \ncrisis. Growth in the Philippines has been strong and robust. The economy expanded by 6.3% \non average during 2010\u20132019, accelerating from 4.5% during 2000\u20132009 and 3.0% in the 1990s. \nIn response to inflationary pressures in 2018 due to food and energy prices the BSP raised its \n \n22 BSP. 2020.

A fiscal consolidation strategy undertaken during 2010\u20132016 helped enforce good fiscal \ndiscipline. The fiscal deficit fell from 3.5% of GDP in 2010 to only 0.9% of GDP in 2015 and has \naveraged only 2.8% per year since then (footnote 12). The stock of debt in the Philippines declined \nfrom 52.4% of GDP in 2010 to 38.9% of GDP in 2019, reflecting the commitment of successive \nadministrations to prudent macro-fiscal management. Tax collections had also begun to increase \nas the government implements its comprehensive national tax reform agenda, including the Tax \nReform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, 2017. The tax\u2013GDP ratio increased from \n13.6% in 2015 to 15.2% in 2019, the highest ratio in more than two decades, with the TRAIN law \ncontributing an additional \u20b1180 billion during its first year of implementation.25    \n \n30.  Lessons learned. The CARES program draws from the experience of the 2009 short-\nterm fiscal stimulus loan for the Philippines under ADB's Countercyclical Support Facility.26 This \nloan provided several lessons. First, during crisis times, speed is of the essence. The loan allowed \nthe government to rapidly scale up fiscal measures which had a positive effect on GDP during the \nworst of the economic slowdown in 2009. Second, targeting is critical. The loan supported \ngovernment\u2019s ongoing and scaled-up social assistance programs, complemented with labor-\nintensive infrastructure programs in agriculture and the social sector. As a result of ADB\u2019s support, \nthe government was able to dampen the effects of the economic crisis on unemployment and \npoverty  incidence.  ADB\u2019s  previous  experience  in  processing  and  implementing  Emergency \nAssistance Loans such as the Emergency Assistance for Relief and Recovery of Typhoon \nYolanda has also informed the CARES program design. First, given the urgency of the crisis and \nthe need to meet critical expenditures, coursing the assistance through the government\u2019s budget \nis important to help finance essential livelihood and economic expenditures. The CARES program \nis closely aligned to fund the government\u2019s financing gap. Second, emergency programs should \nexhibit sufficient flexibility to accommodate a medium- to long-term development horizon and the \ninevitable changes which occur when dealing with complex crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nB.  Proposed Program, Impacts and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n31.  The CARES program will be a critical component of the Government\u2019s efforts to mitigate \nadverse impacts of COVID-19 on the health, incomes, and economic opportunities of the Filipino \npeople. The CARES program will have three outputs: (i) measures taken to combat the spread of \nCOVID-19 in the Philippines; (ii) dedicated funds and programs for social protection and relief to \naffected people allocated and implemented; and (iii) economic stimulus for affected sectors \ndelivered. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The outcome will be the rate \nof spread of the disease managed and poverty contained. The program is also fully aligned with \nthe Philippines Country Partnership Strategy (2018\u20132023).27 \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is a trusted partner for the Philippines in emergency response, \nsocial protection, public sector management, education, and infrastructure. The proposed CARES \nprogram builds on a strong base of country knowledge and five decades of close collaboration. \nUnderpinning the CARES program, ADB is providing policy advisory support on the design of \n \n24 IMF. 2020.

ADB is carrying out a survey of business establishments \nto collect quantitative data on output, employment, and revenues. This will support a better \nunderstanding of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy and enable ADB to help the government \ndesign an effective recovery strategy. In addition, ADB is also processing a new regional technical \nassistance (TA) to assess the efficacy of the stimulus packages as well as draft medium-term \nrecovery and transformational strategies for the post-COVID-19 era for selected countries in \nSoutheast  Asia,  including  the  Philippines.  This  TA  will  also  be  utilized  for  supporting  the \nimplementation of the proposed Philippines CARES Program (para.39).   \n \n33.  ADB is also providing additional COVID-19 support to the government. An additional \nfinancing of $200 million is being processed for the Social Protection Support Project, allowing \nthe  government  to  scale  up  cash  transfers  to  Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program  (4P) \nbeneficiaries, which total more than 4 million households with 85.3% women beneficiaries.28 ADB \nis also processing a proposed $125 million emergency health project to rapidly increase disease \nsurveillance  and  diagnostic  capacity,  infection  prevention  and  control,  and  procurement  of \nnecessary equipment. ADB has also provided a $3 million grant for the procurement of modern \nlaboratory equipment to be housed at the Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital in San \nFernando City, which will help increase testing capacity by an additional 1,000 tests per day.29 In \naddition, ADB also approved a rapid response technical assistance grant for $5 million, which \nleverages private sector donations to provide food baskets to up to 140,000 vulnerable families \naffected by COVID-19 in the NCR.30 \n \n34.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nspecifically priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality (through its support \nfor  social  protection  measures  and  objective  of  containing  the  rise  in  poverty  incidence), \naccelerating progress in gender equality (through support for cash transfers to women and \nmarginalized groups under the ESP), and strengthening governance and institutional capacity \n(through support for strengthening medical institutions and health responses to COVID-19).  \n \nC.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support and Debt Sustainability \n \n35.  Due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s 2020 financing requirement of \nthe government is expected to increase to \u20b11.9 trillion ($37.6 billion) from \u20b11.4 trillion. Domestic \nborrowing will increase by \u20b174.7 billion. The government also plans to increase its foreign \nborrowing  by  \u20b1129.2  billion  ($2.6  billion)  to  finance  its  COVID-19  response  program.  The \ngovernment likewise secured short-term financing from the BSP amounting to \u20b1300 billion.   \n \nTable 5: Urgent Financing Needs and Support for 2020 \n(\u20b1 billion) \nItem  2020   2020   % \n(before  (adjusted for  change \nCOVID-19)   COVID-19) \nGross financing requirement  1,400.1  1,904.1  36.0% \nGross domestic financing  1,047.0  1,121.7   7.1% \nGross foreign financing     353.2     482.4     36.6% \n      Bond Issuances     19 2.4    192.4     \n      ADB COVID-19 Response      88.6 \n \n28 ADB. 2015.

The government has requested four loans, comprised of (i) a regular loan of $250,000,000, \n(ii) a regular loan of $500,000,000, (iii) a regular loan of \u20ac231,632,000 ($250 million equivalent), \nand (iv) a regular loan of \u20ac463,263,000 ($500 million equivalent), all from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, to help finance the anticipated deficit from the pandemic response and countercyclical \nsupport expenditure needs, as well as the steep decline in expected revenue collections.31 The \nfirst US dollar-denominated loan will have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years and \nthe second US dollar-denominated loan will have a 5-year term, including a grace period of 3 \nyears; both with an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  For  the  first  US  dollar-\ndenominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount factor \nis 7.82 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. For the second US dollar-\ndenominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount factor \nis 4.34 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The first Euro-denominated loan \nwill have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years and the second Euro-denominated \nloan will have a 5-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; both with an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. For \nthe first Euro-denominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% \ndiscount factor is 7.82 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. For the second \nEuro-denominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount \nfactor is 4.34 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loans are expected \nto be disbursed in April 2020 ($1 billion) and June 2020 ($500 million) based on government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response financing needs. The total loan size is based on the Philippine\u2019s financing \nneeds, and development spending arising from the development expenditure program.  \n \n \n31 \u20ac0.926526 = $1.00 as of 13 April 2020. \n ", "16 \n37.  Debt sustainability. A recent debt sustainability assessment by the IMF confirmed that \nthe Philippines\u2019 debt levels are sustainable, although the pandemic is expected to elevate overall \ndebt levels (footnote 24). Debt as a percentage of GDP has trended downwards in recent years, \nwith a debt stock that is heavily weighted to longer tenors and domestic currency issues. Under \nnew assumptions reflecting the effect of COVID-19, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase \nto 41.5% in 2020 before eventually falling to 39.6% by 2024. Gross international reserves totaled  \n$87.8 billion at the end of December 2019 and represented 5.1 times the cover of short-term debt \nunder the original maturity concept. The debt service ratio improved to 6.5% from 6.6% for the \nsame period year-on-year.32 Adding $1.5 billion in additional debt under the proposed CARES \nprogram represents an increase of 0.4% of the total outstanding balance. As a percentage of \nGDP, this additional debt would increase the 2020 public debt-to-GDP level to 41.9% from a \nbaseline of 41.5%, before falling to 39.9% by 2024. This increase would not significantly alter the \noutcomes of the debt scenarios modeled by the IMF.33  \n \nD.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n38.  The Philippines has adopted the WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for \nCOVID-19, with a society-wide coordination mechanism. WHO leads the coordination mechanism \nwith the Incident Management Team and the Emergency Operating Center established by the \nDOH. The DOH also leads the national contingency planning process in close collaboration with \nthe National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. This process involves relevant \ngovernment, private sector, and non-governmental actors. WHO is complementing government \nefforts through its Humanitarian Country Team. It established a planning mechanism aimed at \ncoordinating contributions by United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, and \ndonors to support implementation of the national contingency plan. In addition, the United Nations \nhas established an inter-agency task force on socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 with the \nparticipation  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  to  ensure  responses  are  well-aligned  and \ncomplementary. The ADB team has consulted and coordinated closely with the IMF on the \nPhilippines\u2019 macroeconomic situation.34 The IMF mission confirmed the sound macroeconomic \nmanagement and fiscal and debt position of the Philippines and endorses the government\u2019s \nplanned countercyclical expenditure program. At the request of the Government of Philippines, \nthe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has indicated its intention to provide cofinancing \nfor the CARES program, with the size of the loan yet to be determined. AIIB will disburse its \ncofinancing directly to the Government. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n39.  The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency for the CARES program. \nA coordinating and monitoring framework has been established between the Government of the \nPhilippines and ADB to support effective implementation of COVID-19 response and recovery \nplan as captured in the CARES program.35 The mechanism is a venue to share information and \nreport on the implementation of the COVID-19 response and recovery plan, and seeks inputs for \nchanges or improvements. ADB will share experience and updates from other countries and help \nthe government refine response and recovery plans. The framework will also be used to channel \n \n32 The debt service ratio relates principal and interest payments to exports of goods and receipts from services and \nprimary income. \n33 A more detailed discussion is provided in Public Financial Management and Debt Sustainability Assessment \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Country Engagement Framework for COVID-19 Response (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n ", "17 \nADB\u2019s support in the implementation of the plans, as an international partner and facilitator. Under \nthe  framework,  a  policy  committee  will  be  established  to  guide  and  monitor  the  overall \nimplementation  of  the  special  policies,  plans  and  programs  adopted  by  the  Philippines  in \naddressing the impact of COVID-19. The policy committee will meet at least once quarterly and \nwill consult and seek inputs from relevant stakeholders. For this purpose, it will form technical \nworking groups (TWGs) based on priority issues in the agenda. The TWGs will meet as needed \nand will call for feedback and solicit inputs from relevant stakeholders from the private sector and \ncivil society organizations to help shaping the post-COVID-19 response measures.  The TWGs \nwill promote the availability, analysis, and the use of big data in combating COVID-19 effectively. \nThe ADB will coordinate closely with the IATF-EID. Monitoring of implementation will include \ntracking of sex-disaggregated data. The program implementation period is April 2020\u2013May 2021. \nThe proceeds of the loans will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n40.  Governance. The government continues to improve public financial management (PFM) \nand public sector accountability mechanisms. PFM reforms implemented between 2011\u20132016 \nstrengthened  fiscal  discipline  and  allocative  and  technical  efficiency,  while  improving \ntransparency and citizen empowerment. A 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \nassessment found that three of the seven core PFM areas have improved: policy-based budgeting, \ntransparency, and asset\u2013liability management.36 The government has set an aggressive reform \nagenda to promote effective and honest governance and to create an enabling environment for \ncitizens and the private sector. The framework of the PFM Roadmap, 2017\u20132022 aims to \nstrengthen the foundation of the PFM system by focusing on three components: (i) a shift to \nannual cash appropriations; (ii) automation reform, initially through the Budget and Treasury \nManagement System; and (iii) the creation of an Office of the Comptroller General. The key \nreforms  target  improvements  in  costing,  cash  management,  planning  and  budgeting,  and \nprocurement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the DOF.  \n \n41.  Poverty and social considerations. While the poverty rate in the Philippines declined \nfrom 25.2% in 2012 to 23.3% in 2015 and 16.6% in 2018, the absolute poverty rate and the \nnumber of people at risk remain high. Based on data from 2018 on pre-COVID-19 poverty \nestimates for 2020, there were 5.74 million poor and families (about 31.83 million individuals, of \nwhich 15.6 million are women); 17.6 million people are estimated to be living below the poverty \nline and 14.23 million live just above and are vulnerable to sliding back into poverty. Absolute \npoverty is at risk of increasing in the short term because of the weak labor market, critical food \nshortages, reduced or eliminated household earnings, and a drastic decline in remittances. Over \nthe medium term, a slow economic recovery risks prolonged high unemployment and suppressed \nearnings in the informal sector as new labor market entrants outnumber new jobs created. \nStructural poverty may persist and worsen as poor families\u2019 access to social services is reduced \nand the total number in critical need of these services increases rapidly and exponentially. Further, \nthe country faces significant psycho-social counseling needs due to anticipated increases in \nnegative coping strategies throughout the crisis period including heightened rates of domestic \nand  gender-based  violence.  The  government\u2019s  COVID-19  response  program  will  have  an \nimmediate impact on the welfare of families and will help reach a large number of people most \n \n36 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Secretariat. 2016.

Specifically, the ESP will \nprovide unconditional cash transfers to support the poor and vulnerable, while unemployment \nbenefits, scholarships, and skills training grants will help at-risk populations to quickly make the \ntransition back into employment as the economy recovers. Effective implementation of the \nCOVID-19 response will help to control poverty levels from spiking and return them to pre-crisis \nlevels more quickly.  \n \n42.  Gender. The proposed CARES program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming \nat entry. It strengthens the government\u2019s response to the COVID-19 outbreak by addressing \ngender and social inclusion needs. The program aligns with the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act \nwhich expands essential unconditional cash transfer support to 18 million families, through the \nESP (see Box 2). The expanded social assistance will build on the 4P\u2019s framework for conditional \ncash transfers, which currently targets 4.4 million households, of which 85.3% of the beneficiaries \nare women. The unconditional cash transfers support will provide the 4P households, and an \nadditional 13.6 million households with cash grants of \u20b15,000\u2013\u20b18,000 per month. In keeping with \nthe 4P framework, where possible new transfer recipients will be women. However, the magnitude \nof need, the uncertainty of the full humanitarian impact of the pandemic, and the lack of adequate \ninfrastructure to facilitate targeted and efficient financial transfers will challenge efforts to reach \nthe populations in need quickly and effectively. The unconditional cash transfer support under the \nESP (\u20b1205 billion) will be partially financed through ADB's additional financing for the Social \nProtection Support Project (\u20b110.1 billion). A portion of the overall CARES program support  \n(\u20b175.9 billion) will also cover some of the additional funding required (Table 4). The CARES \nprogram will endeavor to: (i) ensure effective targeting of the most vulnerable households \nincluding women-headed households; and (ii) consider the differential effects of the COVID-19 \nupon women and men, of all ages, due to socially constructed roles and norms. A technical \nassistance from the COVID-19 TASF Special Pool Resources is being prepared to respond to the \ngendered impacts of COVID-19 including support for domestic and/or gender-based violence. \n \n43.  Safeguards. The program will not have any adverse social or environmental impacts and \nwill  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  It  is  classified  category  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people safeguards. \n \n44.  Risks and mitigating measures.

Adverse impact of  Border closures and international travel restrictions have significantly impacted global supply chains and \nexogenous shocks  trade, bringing manufacturing and production of goods and services to a halt in many sectors. Tourism \nhas been particularly affected, as travel bans and quarantine requirements discourage any non-essential \nmovement. International arrivals in the Philippines dropped by 40% year-on-year in February 2020, and \nthis contraction is expected to double in March and April 2020. Conservative estimates suggest a decline \nin tourism revenues by as much as $2.3 billion dollars or 0.7% of GDP. Domestic consumption has \nplummeted due to both consumer fears as well as the enforcement of enhanced community quarantine \nin Metro Manila and other major urban centers. The NCR, which accounts for 37% of the total Philippines \neconomy, will experience a sharp contraction in March and April which could be extended until the end \nof quarter 2 depending on the speed and breadth of the virus\u2019s spread. Employment loss is projected to \nreach at least 4 million. Overall, the government expects GDP growth in the Philippines to fall from the \noriginal estimate of 6,2% in 2029 to -1.0%. This could push the economy into recession for the first time \nsince  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  pandemic  is  putting  significant  fiscal  pressure  on  the \nGovernment, which is expected to borrow a record \u20b11.9 trillion. Growing uncertainty in financial markets \nis constraining liquidity options for the government.       \n2. Counter cyclical  The government has laid out a strong countercyclical support program of expenditures to mitigate the \ndevelopment  negative economic impact of the pandemic, totalling 655.6 billion ($12.8 billion). Examples includes:  \nexpenditures  (i) immediate social assistance such as wage subsidies and financial support, social security funds to \ncover  unemployment  benefits  for  dislocated  workers,  and  scholarships  to  support  affected  and \ntemporarily displaced workers through upskilling and reskilling; (ii) cash transfers for 17.9 million at-risk \nfamilies; (iii) economic support for industries and workers most affected by the pandemic including \ntourism, agriculture, and fisheries; and (iv) increasing access to finance for micro and small enterprises, \nand (v) resources to protect critical public spending and provide economic stimulus. About 31% of the \npackage, $4 billion, is in the form of emergency cash assistance for poor and vulnerable households.      \n3. Pre-shock record of  The Philippines has a strong record of sound macroeconomic management. The economy expanded by \ngenerally sound  6.3% on average between 2010\u20132019, accelerating from 4.5% between 2000\u20132009 and 3% in the \nmacroeconomic  1990s. At the same time, the government has carefully managed inflation, which was just 2.5% in 2019. \nmanagement  When headline and core inflation rose above targets in 2018 due to increases in food and energy prices, \nthe government responded with a series of interest rate increases and structural reforms, including the \nenactment of the rice tariffication law and strengthening of the operational monetary policy framework to \nquickly address the situation. A fiscal consolidation strategy undertaken between 2010\u20132016 has helped \nto enforce good fiscal discipline. The fiscal deficit fell from 3.5% of GDP in 2010 to just 0.9% of GDP in ", "  Appendix 4  29 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n2015, and since then has averaged just 2.6% per year. The stock of central government debt in the \nPhilippines has declined from 52.4% of GDP in 2010 to just 38.9% of GDP in 2019, reflecting the \ncommitment of successive administrations to prudent macro-fiscal management. Tax collections have \nalso begun to increase as the government implements its comprehensive national tax reform agenda, \nincluding the TRAIN law. Tax\u2013GDP ratio has increased from 13.6% in 2015 to 15.0% in 2019, with the \nTRAIN law contributing an additional \u20b1180 billion during its first year of implementation. \n4. Structural reforms   The government has implemented a robust response to control the spread of the virus and provide urgent \nmedical support to affected populations. It has collaborated closely with the World Health Organization \non it\u2019s response to the crisis. An Inter-Agency Contingency Plan for Emerging Infectious Diseases and \nCOVID-19 was prepared on 27\u201328 February 2020. Key  health sector priorities include increasing the \ncountry\u2019s diagnostic capacity to determine the presence of the COVID-19 in patients, enhancing infection \ncontrol measures in hospitals and other health facilities, expanding the treatment capacity for COVID-19 \ncases particularly mild and severe cases, and  mobilizing financing for health care providers from the \nDepartment of Health, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, local governments, and other sources, \nand implementing risk and other communication interventions. Some \u20b135.8 billion has been initially \nallocated for priority health and medical services.  \n \nOn 8 March 2020, the Department of Health raised the COVID-19 Alert System to Code Red sub-level \n1 to prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases in the country and to facilitate \nresource mobilization, including procurement of critical logistics and supplies. On 9 March 2020, the \nPresident declared a State of Public Health Emergency, allowing for implementation of mandatory \nreporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control \nprevention measures. On 13 March 2020, with 64 confirmed cases, the government raised the COVID-\n19 Alert System to Code Red sub-level 2 and imposed community quarantine in NCR for 1 month and \nstringent social distancing measures including suspension of classes, mass gatherings, and non-\nessential work, and restriction on land, domestic air, and sea travel to and from NCR. The lockdown was \neventually expanded to the whole island of Luzon with several provinces, cities, and municipalities in \nVisayas and Mindanao imposing similar local-level lockdowns. \n \nBesides support for the health sector, the government\u2019s response package has 4 distinct blocks of \nsupport focused on social assistance, small business relief, poor farmers, and local governments. The \ngovernment has established an Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious \nDiseases to coordinate implementation of their COVID-19 responses. \n5. Debt sustainability  A recent debt sustainability assessment by ADB conducted in March 2020 confirmed that the Philippines\u2019 \ndebt levels are sustainable.   Debt as a percentage of GDP has continued its downward trend, with a \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \ndebt stock that is heavily weighted to longer tenors and domestic currency issues.  According to the IMF, \n\u201cPrudent fiscal management and strong growth are expected to reduce the general government gross \ndebt-to-GDP ratio from 38.9% of GDP in 2018 to 37.5% in 2024\u201d. Likewise, external debt was expected \nto fall to 19.1% of GDP in 2024, from 23.9% in 2018. Total outstanding debt to gross national income \nwas only 19.4% in 2019 and the debt stock exhibited a favorable maturity profile. The weighted average \nmaturity  stood  at  16.7  years,  down  slightly  from  17.1  years  during  the  previous  quarter.  Gross \nInternational Reserves stood at $87.8 billion as of end-December 2019 and represented 5.1 times cover \nof short-term debt under the original maturity concept. The debt service ratio improved to 6.5% from \n6.6% for the same period a year ago. As a percent of GDP, this $1.5 billion additional debt from the \nproposed CPRO assistance would increase the 2020 public debt\u2013GDP level to 41.9% of GDP from \nbaseline of 38.9% of GDP, before falling to 39.9% of GDP by 2024. This increase would be immaterial \nand would not significantly alter the outcomes of the debt scenarios modelled by the IMF. \n6. Coordination with  ADB and the IMF coordinate closely on macroeconomic monitoring and surveillance, including in \nthe International  assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and government finances. The government is in \nMonetary Fund  contact with the IMF on the ongoing measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADB team \nhas consulted and coordinated closely with the IMF on the Philippines\u2019 macroeconomic situation and \nfuture process. The IMF mission confirmed the sound macroeconomic management, and fiscal and debt \nposition of the Philippines, and endorses the government\u2019s planned countercyclical support expenditure \nprogram. \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = Countercyclical Support Facility\u2013COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF \n= International Monetary Fund, NCR = National Capital Region, TRAIN = Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20200416230937+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "philippines, covid-19, coronavirus, pandemic, covid-19 pandemic, adb covid-19 response, emergency response, countercyclical support facility, 54138-001, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20200424094830+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "Subject": "The CARES program, under the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will provide critically needed support to help the Government of the Philippines mitigate the severe health, social, and economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
