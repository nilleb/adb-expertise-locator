As of 15 April 2020, there were 5,453 confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 in the Philippines and 349 deaths, with only 45,486 tests processed in comparison with \na much larger number of tests in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Philippines \nis one of the first developing countries globally and the first in Southeast Asia to introduce strict \nquarantine measures in order to limit spread of the disease, including in Luzon which represents \napproximately 50% of the country\u2019s population and 70% of economic activity.  While critical from \na  health  perspective,  social  isolation  measures  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  growth.  The \ngovernment estimates that gross domestic product (GDP) growth could decline to -1.0% for 2020, \nfrom the originally projected increase of 6.2%.2  \n \n3. \nLivelihoods have also been adversely affected, with unemployment in Luzon expected to \nspike from 5.0% to 22.0% in the second quarter, creating 4.3 million additional unemployed before \nleveling off to 9.2% by June 2021. The real sector has been devastated as most businesses are \nunable to operate. A sharp decline in tourism arrivals and massive disruptions to global supply \nchains are also hurting the economy. An additional 5.5 million Filipinos are expected to fall into \npoverty, with poverty incidence estimated to jump from 16.6% in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020. \n\n \n4. \nThese  shocks  severely  impact  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  give  rise  to  urgent \nnear-term financing needs. Government revenues for the first half of 2020 are projected to decline \nby $8 billion (or 23.4%) relative to the original targets, and an additional $23 billion in spending \nwill be required to fund the government\u2019s initial crisis response. As a result, overall financing needs \nwill reach record levels, with the government requiring close to $40 billion for 2020. The needs \nare  immediate  and  pressing,  with  a  negative  $10.2  billion  cashflow  anticipated  for  the  second \nquarter of 2020. Liquidity in the domestic bond market is also constrained, as corporates react to \nheightened uncertainty by increasing their cash holdings. \n\n \n5. \nThe  CARES  program,  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  COVID-19  Pandemic \nResponse Option (CPRO) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will provide critically needed \nsupport  to  help  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  mitigate  the  severe  health,  social,  and \neconomic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s support will allow the government \nto  undertake  public  expenditures  that  are  essential  for  supporting  vulnerable  populations  and \ncurtailing spread of the disease.  \n\n \n6. \nThe Philippines meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption  (CPRO)  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF),  which  include  robust \nmacroeconomic management, undertaking of key structural reforms, a pro-poor countercyclical \nexpenditure  program,  and  public  debt  levels  maintained  at  sustainable  levels  (Table  1).3 The \nCARES  program  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  including  operational  priorities  on \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Outlook  projects  GDP  growth  in  the  Philippines  to  be  2.0%  in  2020.  The  International \nMonetary Fund projects GDP growth in the Philippines to be 0.6% in 2020 (IMF. 2020. World Economic Outlook: The \nGreat Lockdown. Washington.)  \n\n3   Details on compliance with the access criteria are in Appendix 4. \n\n\faddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n1.

Debt sustainability \n\n6. Coordination with the \n\nInternational Monetary \nFund \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government expects GDP growth in \nthe Philippines to fall to -1.0% in 2020 against the original estimate of 6.2%, \nwith employment loss projected at more than 4 million. This could push the \neconomy  into  recession  for  the  first  time  since  the  1997  Asian  financial \ncrisis. Gross financing requirements have reached record levels due to the \ncrisis.  Growing  uncertainty  in  financial  markets  is  constraining  liquidity \noptions for the government. \nThe  government  announced  a  \u20b1655.6  billion  ($12.8  billion)  pro-poor \ncounter-cyclical expenditure program with focus on social protection for the \nvulnerable,  scaling  up  resources  for  the  health  sector,  protecting  critical \npublic  spending,  and  providing  economic  stimulus.  About  31%  of  the \npackage, $4 billion, will be in the form of emergency cash assistance for \nthe poor and vulnerable households. \nPrior  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  economy  expanded  by  6.3%  on \naverage during 2010\u20132019. Inflation had been carefully managed and was \nonly 2.5% in 2019. Tax reforms had  increased the tax-to-GDP ratio from \n13.6% in 2015 to 15.2% in 2019. Fiscal deficit averaged only 2.8% between \n2016-2019. \nThe Philippines has taken several concrete and credible steps to contain \nthe spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the social and economic impact on \nthe population (Table 4, Box 1-3). It has collaborated closely with the World \nHealth  Organization.  The  government  imposed  an  enhanced  community \nquarantine  over  the  entire  island  of  Luzon  and  was  the  first  to  introduce \nsuch  decisive  measures  in  Southeast  Asia.  It  announced  a  \u20b135.8  billion \n($0.7 billion) health response package. As presented in Table 4, besides \nsupport for the health sector, the government\u2019s response package has 4 \ndistinct  blocks  of  support  focused  on  social  assistance,  small  business \nrelief,  poor  farmers,  and  local  governments.  The  government  has \nestablished an Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging \nInfectious  Diseases  to  coordinate  implementation  of  their  COVID-19 \nresponses. \nCentral government debt fell from 52.4% of GDP to 38.9% of GDP between  \n2010\u20132019.  Additional  borrowing  under  the  CPRO  has  minimal  (0.4%) \nimpact  on  debt\u2013GDP  ratio,  with  recovery  to  almost  pre-crisis  levels  by \n2024. \nADB  is  in  close  contact  with  the  IMF  on  macroeconomic  monitoring, \nespecially  related  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19.  IMF  has  provided  its \nassessment letter. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank,  CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option,  GDP = gross domestic product, \nIMF = International Monetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n7. \nWe  are  in  the  midst  of  an  unprecedented  global  pandemic.  In  December  2019, \nresidents of Wuhan in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) were diagnosed with a previously \nunknown  coronavirus.  Since  then,  COVID-19  has  spread  quickly  across  the  world  and  on  \n11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fpandemic. As of 15 April 2020, more than 2.0 million cases were confirmed across 185 countries \nand  territories,  resulting  in  more  than  134,000  deaths. 4  In  contrast,  the  2002  severe  acute \nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) global outbreak resulted in 813 deaths, and the 2012 middle-east \nrespiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in 858 deaths.5 The COVID-19 pandemic is also \nseverely impacting the global economy, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects to \ngo into recession in 2020.6  \n \n8. \nPhilippines health system is under heavy stress.  COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in the \nPhilippines. The government confirmed the first case on 30 January 2020. After almost a month \nof  limited  activity,  cases  have  begun  to  grow  exponentially,  from  seven  confirmed  cases  on  \n9 March 2020 to 5,453 confirmed cases (with about 50% in the National Capital Region [NCR]) \nand 349 deaths as of 15 April 2020. Confirmed cases had been doubling approximately every  \n3\u20134 days in March 2020, while the pace has slowed somewhat in April 2020.7 Assuming a basic \nreproduction number (R0) between 1.5 to 4, the University of the Philippines COVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse  Team  predicts  that  the  cumulative  number  of  infected  individuals  (including \nasymptomatic individuals and unreported cases) could increase from approximately 750,000 to \n1.7 million, with 75% of these located in the NCR. Without effective interventions, cases in Metro \nManila are expected to peak between April and June 2020.8 \n\n \n9. \nThe growing number of confirmed cases and persons under investigation (PUI) place a \nheavy strain on the Philippine health system.9 Global shortages of supplies initially constrained \nthe government\u2019s testing capacity to just 450 tests per day, making it difficult to track the spread \nof  the  virus.  While  treatment  and  infection  control  protocols  are  evolving,  increased  vigilance \nagainst transmission to health workers rapidly depleted stocks of personal protective equipment \n(PPE). The care of each confirmed case and PUI requires the use of at least 30 sets of disposable \nPPE a day. This also affects the ability of health workers to attend to non-COVID-19 patients, and \nincreases their risk of COVID-19 infection, further straining the health system. \n \nTreatment capacity for COVID-19 patients was also limited by shortages of hospital beds \n10. \n(1 bed per 984 people), doctors (1 per 2,000 people), and ventilators. Unofficial estimates suggest \njust 1,500 installed ventilators nationwide, with approximately 500 in the NCR. The Philippines \nhas  2.2  critical  care  beds  with ventilators  per  100,000  people,  which is  low  relative  to ASEAN \npeers (Table 2). Shortages are likely to be exacerbated as many countries look to increase stocks \nof these essential items. \n\nTable 2: Summary Comparison of COVID-19 Related Data and Effects \n\n \n\nCountry \n\nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \n\nNo. of \ncases \n(as of \n15 April \n2020) \n\n5,136  \n5,072  \n5,453  \n\nTests \nprocessed \nper 1 million \npopulation  \n(as of 15 April \n2020) \n   132  \n2,694  \n   415  \n\n \n\nCritical \ncare \nbeds/ \n100,000 \n\nGDP \nforecasta/ \nfiscal \ndeficit (%) \n\nJob \nlosses \n(million) \n\nPoverty \nestimates \n(pre-/post-\nCOVID-19; \n(%) \n\nAnnounced \nstimulus \npackage  \n($ billion) \n\n   2.7 \n   3.4 \n   2.2 \n\n0.5/-5.1 \n-2.0/-4.7 \n-1.0/-5.3 \n\n7 \n2.4 \n4.3 \n\n9.4/11.9\u201312.8 \n0.4/NA \n16.6/20.7 \n\n32.4 \n60.3 \n12.8 \n\n4  Johns Hopkins University. 2020.

On 13 March 2020, the government \nenforced enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) measures to control the spread of the virus\u2014\nfirst \nisland  of  Luzon,  effective  until  \n30 April 2020. The Philippines was the first country in Southeast Asia and the third country in the \nworld  to  introduce  dramatic  steps  in  order  to  control  the  spread  of  the  virus.  While  ECQ  is \nexpected  to  save  lives  and  flatten  the  pandemic  curve,  it  causes  economic  hardship.  Luzon\u2019s \neconomy will contract in March and April 2020. A sharp decline in Philippines economic growth is \nexpected from 5.9% in 2019 to -1.0% in 2020, pulling the economy into recession for the first time \nsince the 1990s. \n \n12. \nHousehold consumption and investment are also contracting. Domestic consumption has \ndecreased, with consumption of nonessential commodities expected to fall by 5%\u201310% for 2020, \na  loss  of  \u20b194  billion  or  0.5%  of  GDP.  The  Purchasing  Managers  Index,  an  indicator  of \nmanufacturing performance, fell from 52.1 in January 2020 to 39.7 in March 2020, an all-time low. \nFactory shutdowns have led to a sharp drop in production. The country\u2019s three largest cement \nmanufacturers temporarily shut down their factories and distribution operations in Luzon. Micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  have  been  severely  affected,  as  sales  fall  and \ncash  reserves  are  depleted.  MSMEs  comprised  63%  of  the  country\u2019s  employment  among \nregistered establishments in 2018, with about a third of the employment in microenterprises. Half \nof the MSME jobs are in Luzon, with a high concentration (58%) registered by women.10 \n \n13. \nThe pandemic has severely affected tourism and international trade. In February 2020, \ntourist arrivals declined 40% year-on-year. This contraction is expected to double in March and \nApril  2020.11 Conservative  estimates  project  a  decline  of  up  to  \u20b1118  billion  or  0.7%  of GDP  in \ntourism revenues in 2020 (footnote 11). International trade has also been disrupted. Total exports \nto PRC have fallen by more than 50% since the beginning of 2020.12 Electronics, representing \n55% of total exports, have been highly affected by supply chain disruptions. Exports from special \neconomic zones declined by over 66% to $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, from $12.9 billion \nin the first quarter of 2019.

As of the end of January 2020, the banking system \nreported lending concentrations in manufacturing (10% of total loans), wholesale and retail trade \n(12%  of  total  loans),  and  real  estate  activities  (12%  of  total  loans).  These  exposures  total  \n\u20b14.2 trillion. Fitch Ratings recently assessed the direct sector exposure of banking systems in the \nPhilippines  and  found  that  the  highest  exposure  risks  stem  from  large  corporations  including \nairlines, construction, and other key industries that the pandemic affects directly.15 The spread on \n10-year  Philippine  government  bonds  relative  to  United  States  (US)  government  bonds  has \nincreased by almost 200 basis points, reflecting underlying vulnerabilities (Figure 1). \n\n \nFigure 1: Challenging Conditions for the Financial Sector  \n\n5-year Credit Default Swap\n\nPhilippines 10-year Yield Spread to US \nTreasury\n\ns\nt\n\ni\n\nn\no\nP\n \ns\ns\na\nB\n\ni\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n \n\n9\n1\n\n/\n\n7\n2\n2\n1\n\n/\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n/\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n7\n1\n\n/\n\n1\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n4\n2\n\n/\n\n1\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n1\n3\n\n/\n\n1\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n4\n1\n\n/\n\n2\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n1\n2\n\n/\n\n2\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n8\n2\n\n/\n\n2\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n3\n1\n\n/\n\n3\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n3\n\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n7\n2\n\n/\n\n3\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n6\n0\n3\n0\n\n/\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n/\n\n7\n0\n2\n0\n\n/\n\n \n9\n9\n1\n1\n/\n/\n7\n2\n2\n1\n/\n/\n2\n7\n1\n2\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n/\n1\n2\n/\n/\n3\n3\n0\n/\n1\n0\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n/\n1\n2\n/\n/\n0\n0\n1\n1\n/\n1\n0\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n1\n7\n/\n1\n7\n/\n1\n1\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n1\n4\n/\n2\n4\n/\n2\n1\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n1\n1\n/\n3\n1\n/\n3\n1\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n2\n4\n/\n1\n4\n/\n1\n2\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n2\n1\n/\n2\n1\n/\n2\n2\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n2\n8\n/\n2\n8\n/\n2\n2\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n3\n3\n/\n1\n3\n/\n1\n3\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n3\n0\n/\n2\n0\n/\n2\n3\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n/\n/\n3\n7\n/\n2\n7\n/\n2\n3\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n/\n2\n2\n/\n/\n7\n7\n0\n/\n2\n0\n\n \n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n/\n3\n2\n/\n/\n6\n6\n0\n/\n3\n0\n\n \nUS = United States. \nNote: Format of dates is day/month/year.    \nSource: Philippine Stock Exchange; and Asia Bonds Online.

The ECQ, while necessary to control the spread of COVID-19, is dramatically \naffecting  employment  in  Luzon  and  other  urban  centers.  Of  the  NCR\u2019s  5.4  million  workers, \napproximately 79% are engaged in the services sector, where the impact is severe. Work from \nhome  arrangements  are  not  amenable  to  wholesale,  retail,  accommodation,  food  service,  and \ntransport  jobs,  which  account  for  39.8%  or  2.1  million  workers  in  the  NCR.  Women  represent \napproximately  60%  of  the  wholesale  and  retail  trade  sector  employment  and  are  particularly \naffected.16 ADB projects that the unemployment rate in Luzon will increase from 5.3% in October \n2019  to  22%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2020,  creating  4.3  million  additional  unemployed.  Non-\nregular workers in hotels, restaurants and retail, and manufacturing are likely to be laid off, while \nmany regular workers in the services sector are likely to be put on unpaid leave.

In  2017,  there  were  39  million \nwomen working in the informal economy. These workers are more likely to be exposed to unsafe \nworking conditions,  limited  security  of  tenure,  lower  and irregular  income,  and limited  workers\u2019 \nrights.17 Women also lose opportunities as unpaid care work has increased, with children out of \nschool and elevated care needs of elderly and infirm. Women and girls also earn less, save less, \nand are more likely to hold insecure jobs, compounding the economic impacts of the pandemic.18 \n \n\nFigure 2: Dramatic Expected Rise in Unemployment Rates in Luzon \n\n2019Q4\n\n2020Q1\n\n2020Q2\n\n2020Q3\n\n2020Q4\n\n2021Q1\n\n2021Q2\n\nUnem (pre-Covid)\n\nUnem (Covid)\n\nQ = quarter. \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  estimates.  These  estimates  are  based  on  the  assumptions  that \nnon-regular workers in \u2018high contact-intensive\u2019 jobs in services and manufacturing are laid off first as \na result of the Luzon enhanced community quarantine, with a subsequent fall in household spending \nand investment. The simulations assume (i) economic growth of -2.0% for 2020 and economic growth \nof 6.5% for 2021, and (ii) employment elasticity of 0.6 and labor force growth of 2.6% in 2020 and \n2021.  \n\n \n\n \n18. \nFalling  remittances  from  overseas,  which  represent  9%  of  GDP,  will  further  reduce \nincomes  of  Filipinos.  Seafarers  have  been  immediately  affected  as  trade  and  travel  are \ndisrupted\u2014they  alone  accounted  for  $6.5  billion  of  remittances  in  2019.19 Low-income  Filipino \nmigrant workers send more than twice the monthly household income their families earn at home, \nmaking these families heavily reliant on remittances. \n\n \nPoverty reduction trends  could  be  reversed.  The government  reduced poverty from \n19. \n23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018 through a combination of sustained economic growth, job creation, \nand social assistance programs. The number of poor individuals fell from 23.5 million in 2015 to \n17.6  million  in  2018.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  could  reverse  these  gains.  ADB  projects  that \nwithout substantial fiscal support to poor and vulnerable families, poverty incidence could increase \nfrom 16.6% in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020. This equates to 5.5 million more Filipinos falling into poverty, \na  68.6%  increase  in  the  NCR  and  a  31.3%  increase  nationally.  Assuming  economic  growth \nreturns to its long-term trend in 2021, there is a risk that poverty incidence would only decrease \nto 20.2% by the end of 2021, reflecting the lasting effects of the pandemic (Figure 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n17 Government  of  the  Philippines,  Philippine  Institute  for  Development  Studies.  2019.

For 2021, economic growth \nestimated at 6.5%.  \n\n        \n \n \n \nThe pandemic is creating significant fiscal pressure through several channels. First, \n20. \ndisruptions  to  business  and  economic  shocks  are  critically  impacting  government  revenue \ncollections.  Weaker  domestic  business  activity  and  slower  imports  will  reduce  revenues  and \nwiden  the  2020  budget  deficit  to  5.3%  of  GDP,  from  an  originally  programmed  3.2%.  These \nestimates  exclude  the  cost  of  the  recovery  plan.  Conservative  estimates  suggest  that  if  the \npandemic  continues  until  June  2020,  revenue  collections  could  be  \u20b1500  billion  lower  than  the \ngovernment\u2019s  target  of  \u20b13.5  trillion  for  2020.  An  extended  tax-filing  deadline  will  also  delay \ncollections  of  approximately  \u20b1145  billion.  Second,  additional  public  spending  on  core  public \nservices  (including  medical  care,  social  protection,  and  economic  support)  is  necessary  to \nrespond to the crisis. Third, fiscal pressures will be sharpest during the second and third quarters \nof  2020,  when  a  large  fiscal  imbalance  is  expected.  The  government  will  borrow  a  record  \n\u20b11.9 trillion in 2020, with the greatest need falling in the second quarter. \n \n\n  \nRevenues \nExpenditures \n   Operating \n   Capital \n   Net lending \nOff-budget transfers from \nGOCCs \n\nBalance \n\n2019 \n\nTable 3: Fiscal Position  \n(\u20b1 billion) \n2020 \npre-\nCOVID \n3,492.0 \n4,163.0 \n3,340.0 \n   813.0 \n     10.0 \n\n2020 \npost-\nCOVID \n2,995.6 \n4,185.6 \n3,522.9 \n   652.7 \n     10.0 \n\n3,173.5 \n3,814.8 \n3,051.8 \n   745.9 \n     17.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n   200.0 \n\n  \n(641.3) \n\n   \n(671.0) \n\n   (990.0) \n\n% \nChange \n(yoy) \n  (5.6%) \n  9.7% \n    15.4% \n   (12.5%) \n   (41.5%) \n\n \n\n    54.4% \n\n% Change (2020 \npre- vs post-\nCOVID) \n(14.2%) \n  0.5% \n  5.5% \n(19.7%) \n  0.0% \n\n \n\n 47.5% \n\n( ) = negative, COVID = coronavirus disease, GOCC = government-owned and controlled corporation, Q = quarter, yoy \n= year-on-year.  \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding. \nSources: Asian Development Bank calculations. \n \n21. \nThe government has mounted a rapid and robust crisis response. On 15 March 2020, \nthe  government  announced  a  COVID-19  response  strategy,  with  several  priority  actions  to \naddress  the  negative  impacts  of  the  pandemic  and  combat  the  spread  of  COVID-19.  The \ngovernment established the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious \nDiseases (IATF-EID) to provide overall policy guidance on containing COVID-19. The IATF-EID \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fis headed by the Department of Health (DOH), and comprises the Department of Foreign Affairs, \nthe Department of Interior and Local Government, the Department of Labor and Employment, and \nother  key  agencies.  Specific  measures  under  the  response  strategy  include:  (i) enhanced \nquarantine to reduce the infection rate; (ii) expanded medical services to step up testing and care \nfor affected populations; (iii) social protection and livelihood support to help mitigate the immediate \nimpacts on livelihoods and employment; and (iv) broader fiscal stimulus to support the economy \nand speed up recovery. The response package is estimated at \u20b1655.6 billion ($12.8 billion, or \n3.6% of GDP) (Table 4). The fiscal impact of the stimulus packages can be significant in restarting \ngrowth in the economy due to the  multiplier  effects  of  its spending  and tax relief  components. \nPreliminary  estimates  by  ADB  show  that the  overall  impact  of  the  response  could  lead  to  a \ncumulative increase in real GDP of $15.2 billion after one year, and $17.2 billion after two years, \nequivalent to 4.2% and 4.8% of GDP, respectively.20 \n \n\nTable 4: Government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program \n\nProgram \n\nDescription \n\n1.

In 2020, the health sector budget \n22. \nwas \u20b1175.8 billion (4.3% of the national budget), of which \u20b1104.4 billion was for the DOH. The \ngovernment has announced a \u20b135.8 billion health sector package to respond to the pandemic. \nThese  funds  will  help  improve  capacity  and  staffing  for  COVID-19  testing  at  subnational \nlaboratories,  purchase  PPEs  and  supplies  for  testing,  improve  rapid  response  screening \ncapabilities, scale up facilities and cover operating costs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, \nand  cover  medical  expenses  of  patients  and  health  personnel.  Additionally,  an  Inter-Agency \nContingency Plan for Emerging Infectious Diseases and COVID-19 was released on 28 February \n2020.  Key  health  sector  priorities  include:  (i)  increasing  the  country\u2019s  diagnostic  capacity  to \ndetermine  the  presence  of  COVID-19  in  patients;  (ii)  enhancing  infection  control  measures  in \nhospitals and other health facilities; (iii) expanding the treatment capacity for COVID-19 cases; \n(iv)  mobilizing  financing  for  health  care  providers  from  the  DOH,  Philippine  Health  Insurance \nCorporation,  local  governments,  and  other  sources;  and  (v)  implementing  risk  and  other \ncommunication interventions. \n \n23. \nNon-health-facilities  including  the  Philippine  International  Convention  Center  and  the \nPhilippine  Arena  are  being  converted  into  quarantine  zones  for  the  growing  number  of  mild \nCOVID-19 cases, PUIs, and recovered patients undergoing home quarantine. Molecular analysis \nhas been brought online with eight government and three private laboratories, increasing testing \ncapacity to 3,000 per day. The government plans to increase testing capacity to at least 8,000 \ntests a day in May 2020 by upgrading additional private and government labs. To rationalize the \nuse of hospital beds, doctors, and critical care beds, three major government NCR hospitals were \ndesignated as exclusive hospitals for COVID-19 cases. The designation of COVID-19 facilities \n\n \n\n\fwill free additional capacity in other hospitals to support non-COVID-19 cases. The DOH plans to \nprocure  1,000  additional  ventilators,  with  more  to  follow.  The  Philippine  Health  Insurance \nCorporation has begun paying hospitalization costs of COVID-19 cases, particularly for frontline \nhealth workers. These measures are aimed at flattening the curve; the rate of confirmed cases \ndoubling has begun to fall, from 3\u20134 days in March 2020 to 6\u20137 days in April 2020. However, it is \nimportant  to  reflect  that  the  Philippines  has  processed  a relatively  small  number  of  COVID-19 \ntests (33,814 as of 14 April 2020) compared with other countries in the region. Box 1 provides \nadditional detail. In addition to national measures, the Philippines has also committed to regional \nsharing of data and lessons learned.21  \n \n24. \nThe  government  has  rolled  out  wide-ranging  countercyclical  support  measures. \nThese measures are intended to address the effects of the pandemic and protect critical public \nexpenditures. The government\u2019s non-health response package totals \u20b1619.8 billion. Focus areas \ninclude:  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nImmediate increase in social assistance. On 25 March 2020, Congress passed \nthe Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, providing the President with emergency powers \nto  reallocate  budgeted  funds  and  access  off-budget  funds for  the  government\u2019s \ncrisis response. Chief among these is a \u20b1205 billion Emergency Subsidy Program \n(ESP)  providing  unconditional  cash  transfers  (Box  2).  This  complements  other \nsocial  protection  and  income  support  measures  to  help  vulnerable  workers \nweather  the  crisis,  including  financial  assistance  to  displaced  and  vulnerable \nworkers, unemployment benefits, support for repatriated overseas Filipino workers, \nand scholarships and skills development for displaced workers. \n\nBox 1: Stepping up the Health Response \n \nThe  government  has  taken  urgent  action  to  rapidly  address  the  health  impacts  of  the  pandemic, \nincluding both prevention and treatment. Immediate priorities include the following. \n\nMeasure \nPreparedness \nplan \n\nDescription \nThe plan details: (i) clinical management of severe and critical cases; (ii) infection prevention \nand control among health workers and general population; and (iii) specimen management \nand laboratory confirmation to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. \n\nTesting \n\nSocial distancing  Community quarantine was initially imposed in NCR on 15 March 2020 followed by an ECQ \nfor the whole of Luzon the following day. A number of local governments from Visayas and \nMindanao  also  imposed  community  quarantine.  The  ECQ  banned  mass  gatherings  and \ntemporary closed schools, workplaces, religious activities, and public transport. People may \nstill travel to fulfill basic needs such as going to the supermarket or pharmacy. \nThere are now 11 molecular labs capable of processing up to 3,000 tests a day. More than \n100,000 tests kits were donated and local production of PCR test kits by the UP-National \nInstitutes of Health has been initiated. \nThe government designated three COVID-19 only hospitals in NCR (UP-Philippine General \nHospital,  Lung  Center  of  the  Philippines, and  Jose  Rodriguez  Memorial  Hospital)  and  55 \nother COVID-19 referral hospitals, repurposed several convention centers, stadiums, and \nother facilities into temporary health facilities that would house suspect and mild COVID-19 \ncases. The government purchased a million new sets of PPEs and is working with industry \nassociations and local firms for the local production of 10,000 sets of PPEs a day. \nThe government stopped all domestic air and sea travel to and from Luzon and restricted \ntravel to the Philippines by all foreigners with few exceptions. \n\nRepurposing and \nbuilding of \nfacilities \n\nDomestic and \ninternational \ntravel restrictions \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, ECQ = enhanced community quarantine, NCR = National Capital Region, PCR = polymerase \nchain reaction, PPE = personal protective equipment, UP = University of the Philippines. \nSource: Government of the Philippines, Department of Health. \n\n  \n\n \n21 ASEAN. 2020.

For  4Ps  families,  where \n85.3%  of  recipients  are  women,  the  government \nintends to  deliver cash transfers directly to women \nwherever possible.  \n \nA  comprehensive  list  of  beneficiaries  for  each \nlocality is prepared and validated against a national \ndatabase  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  to  expedite \ndelivery. Where supported by existing infrastructure, \ntransfers are made directly through DSWD\u2019s partner \nbanks,  money \nfacilities,  and  service \npartners;  for  beneficiaries  not  previously  covered, \ngrants are delivered through direct cash payouts by \nDSWD personnel, with strict tracking and reporting \narrangements.  The  Department  of  the  Interior  and \nLocal  Government  has  also  issued  guidelines  to \nLGUs  to  require  compliance  in  the  consistent \nidentification  of  beneficiaries  and  distribution  of \ngrants. More detailed discussion on the ESP can be \nfound  in  the  Summary  of  Emergency  Subsidy \nProgram and Social Amelioration Guidelines.    \n\nAs part of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the \nrolling  out  a  \u20b1205  billion \ngovernment \nEmergency  Subsidy  Program  (ESP)  to  ensure \nincome  and  food  security  for  affected  families\u2014\nthe largest social program in the country\u2019s history. \n \nThe  ESP  provides  grants  of  \u20b15,000\u2013\u20b18,000  per \nmonth  for  up  to  18  million  families,  representing \nthe  population.  Target  beneficiaries \n75%  of \ninclude 4Psa families, informal economy workers, \nand  other  vulnerable  populations \nincluding \nindigent senior citizens, persons with disabilities, \npregnant  and  solo  parents,  indigenous  peoples \nand the homeless.  \n \nThe  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and \nDevelopment \nthe \nimplementation of the ESP, partnering with Local \nGovernment Units (LGUs).

The  government  has  planned  a  major  relief \nprogram  to  support  small  businesses,  which  play  an  important  role  in  both  the \neconomy  and  employment  in  the  Philippines.  Relief  measures  include  a  wage \nsubsidy for small-businesses covering up to 3.4 million employees in the formal \nsector, a credit guarantee facility to help more than 1.5 million small businesses \naccess loans, tax relief for 1.5 million small businesses, and a financing program \nthrough the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure small businesses are able \nto meet cashflow needs during the crisis. Box 3 provides additional details. \n \n\n(ii) \n\nBox 3: Wage Subsidies for Small Businesses \n\n \nThe  government  has  established  the  Small  Business  Wage  Subsidy  Program  (SBWSP)  to  provide \ncritical relief to small businesses and their employees. Approximately 436,000 small businesses have \ntemporarily closed, another 1,000,000 are operating on a skeletal workforce, and only 117,666 small \nbusinesses  have  remained  open.  Drawing  on  best  international  practice,  the  Philippines  is  the  first \ndeveloping  member  country  to  establish  such  a  scheme  specifically  to  address  the  COVID-19 \npandemic impact on employment. The scheme has two objectives. First, to incentivize businesses to \nremain  attached  to  their  employees  for  rapid  resumption  of  operations  after  the  crisis.  Second,  to \nprovide income stability, allowing Filipino workers to manage during the ECQ. The scheme is budgeted \nat $1.0 billion and targets 1.5 million small businesses employing 3.4 million workers. The program is \nadministered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Social Security System (SSS). Under \nthe  scheme  small  businesses  apply  online  for  the  wage  subsidy  on  behalf  of  their  employees. \nBusinesses  registered  with  BIR  and  SSS  (covering  about  2.6  million  workers)  will  be  prioritized  for \nfunding  under  the  scheme,  followed  by  non-registered  businesses.  The  monthly  subsidy  is  fixed \nbetween  \u20b15,000  and  \u20b18,000  per  employee  and  paid  for  two  months.  The  SSS  will  credit  the  wage \nsubsidy directly to the employee\u2019s bank account upon notifying both the employee and the employer. \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSupport  for  agriculture  and  other  economic  sectors.  The  government  is \nproviding  targeted  assistance  to  affected  and  vulnerable  sectors.  This  includes \nfinancial  assistances  to  farmers  including  resiliency  support  and  other  crop \nproduction  products  targeting  increased  production,  interest-free  financing  for \nfarmers for up to \u20b125,000, and additional funding to boost emergency buffer stocks \nfor rice. \n \nLocal  government  support.  The  government  has  also  empowered  local \ngovernments  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  constituents  during  the  crisis.  This \nincludes  significant  additional  budget  transfers  to  local  governments  to  support \nprograms for vulnerable communities and sectors, and emergency loans to local \ngovernments from the Philippines Landbank to support urgent spending needs. \n \n\n25. \nAs  part  of  its  COVID-19  response  strategy,  the  government  is  also  raising  additional \nfinancing  to  fund  the  emergency  initiatives  and the  economic  stimulus.  It  accessed  short-term \nfinancing  amounting  to \u20b1300 billion  from  the  Bangko Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  (Central  Bank  of  the \nPhilippines [BSP]). It is planning to secure additional financing of \u20b1310 billion from multilateral \nand bilateral sources. \n \n26. \nBSP  has put  in  place a range  of  monetary  policy measures. In  February  2020,  the \nBSP undertook a preemptive interest rate cut of 25 basis points, followed by an additional cut of \n50 basis points on 19 March 2020. This brings the overnight reverse repurchase rate to 3.25% to \nreduce the cost of borrowing and cushion the shock to the economy. Overnight deposit rates were \nreduced  to  2.75%  and  lending  rates  were  cut  to  3.75%  on  20  March  2020.  The  reserve \nrequirement  ratio  of  universal  and  commercial  banks  was  also  reduced  by  200  basis  points \neffective  30  March  2020.  These  actions  have  infused  around  \u20b1220  billion  of  liquidity  into  the \nsystem. Inflation is forecast to slow relative to 2019 and is expected to fall within the government\u2019s \n2%\u20134% target range. \n\n \n27. \nFinance  sector  risks  are  being  managed.  On  14  March  2020,  the  BSP  published  a \nmemorandum  on  regulatory  relief for  BSP-supervised  financial  institutions  affected  by  COVID-\n19.22 This was followed by a second policy relief package issued on 19 March 2020.23 Together \nthese packages provide relief to both wholesale and retail stakeholders. At the wholesale level, \nthe  BSP  adopted  measures  to  increase  the  flow  of  liquidity  to  the  banking  system  and  the \ncountry\u2019s largest conglomerates. The single borrower limit has been temporarily increased and \nconditions on the use of the BSP\u2019s rediscount facility have been relaxed. At the retail level, the \nBSP encouraged banks to keep lending to borrowers by temporarily encouraging restructuring \nand  forbearance  for  affected  borrowers. In  addition,  the  BSP  has  temporarily  waived  the \napplication  of  past-due  status  for  affected  borrowers  and  is  allowing  a  phased  buildup  of  the \nallowance for loan losses over time. Finally, routine documentary and filing requirements have \nbeen streamlined or curtailed. \n \n28. \nThere has been a sound record of macroeconomic management leading up to the \ncrisis. Growth in the Philippines has been strong and robust. The economy expanded by 6.3% \non average during 2010\u20132019, accelerating from 4.5% during 2000\u20132009 and 3.0% in the 1990s. \nIn response to inflationary pressures in 2018 due to food and energy prices the BSP raised its \n\n22 BSP.  2020.

Slowing  food  price  inflation  served  as  the  main  inflationary  brake  following  the \nenactment of the rice tariffication law.24  \n \n29. \nA fiscal consolidation strategy undertaken during 2010\u20132016 helped enforce good fiscal \ndiscipline. The fiscal deficit fell from 3.5% of GDP in 2010 to only 0.9% of GDP in 2015 and has \naveraged only 2.8% per year since then (footnote 12). The stock of debt in the Philippines declined \nfrom 52.4% of GDP in 2010 to 38.9% of GDP in 2019, reflecting the commitment of successive \nadministrations to prudent macro-fiscal management. Tax collections had also begun to increase \nas the government implements its comprehensive national tax reform agenda, including the Tax \nReform  for  Acceleration  and  Inclusion  (TRAIN)  law,  2017.  The  tax\u2013GDP  ratio  increased  from \n13.6% in 2015 to 15.2% in 2019, the highest ratio in more than two decades, with the TRAIN law \ncontributing an additional \u20b1180 billion during its first year of implementation.25    \n \n30. \nLessons  learned.  The CARES  program  draws from the  experience of  the  2009  short-\nterm fiscal stimulus loan for the Philippines under ADB's Countercyclical Support Facility.26 This \nloan provided several lessons. First, during crisis times, speed is of the essence. The loan allowed \nthe government to rapidly scale up fiscal measures which had a positive effect on GDP during the \nworst  of  the  economic  slowdown  in  2009.  Second,  targeting  is  critical.  The  loan  supported \ngovernment\u2019s  ongoing  and  scaled-up  social  assistance  programs,  complemented  with  labor-\nintensive infrastructure programs in agriculture and the social sector. As a result of ADB\u2019s support, \nthe  government  was able to dampen the  effects  of the  economic  crisis  on  unemployment  and \npoverty  incidence.  ADB\u2019s  previous  experience  in  processing  and  implementing  Emergency \nAssistance  Loans  such  as  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Relief  and  Recovery  of  Typhoon \nYolanda has also informed the CARES program design. First, given the urgency of the crisis and \nthe need to meet critical expenditures, coursing the assistance through the government\u2019s budget \nis important to help finance essential livelihood and economic expenditures. The CARES program \nis closely aligned to fund the government\u2019s financing gap. Second, emergency programs should \nexhibit sufficient flexibility to accommodate a medium- to long-term development horizon and the \ninevitable changes which occur when dealing with complex crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nB. \n \n31. \nThe CARES program will be a critical component of the Government\u2019s efforts to mitigate \nadverse impacts of COVID-19 on the health, incomes, and economic opportunities of the Filipino \npeople. The CARES program will have three outputs: (i) measures taken to combat the spread of \nCOVID-19 in the Philippines; (ii) dedicated funds and programs for social protection and relief to \naffected  people  allocated  and  implemented;  and  (iii)  economic  stimulus  for  affected  sectors \ndelivered. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The outcome will be the rate \nof spread of the disease managed and poverty contained. The program is also fully aligned with \nthe Philippines Country Partnership Strategy (2018\u20132023).27 \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is a trusted partner for the Philippines in emergency response, \nsocial protection, public sector management, education, and infrastructure. The proposed CARES \nprogram builds on a strong base of country knowledge and five decades of close collaboration. \nUnderpinning  the  CARES  program,  ADB  is  providing  policy  advisory  support  on  the  design  of \n\nProposed Program, Impacts and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nNo. 20/36.

ADB is carrying out a survey of business establishments \nto  collect  quantitative  data  on  output,  employment,  and  revenues.  This  will  support  a  better \nunderstanding of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy and enable ADB to help the government \ndesign an effective recovery strategy. In addition, ADB is also processing a new regional technical \nassistance (TA)  to  assess  the  efficacy  of the  stimulus packages  as  well  as draft  medium-term \nrecovery  and  transformational  strategies  for  the  post-COVID-19  era  for  selected  countries  in \nSoutheast  Asia,  including  the  Philippines.  This  TA  will  also  be  utilized  for  supporting  the \nimplementation of the proposed Philippines CARES Program (para.39).   \n \n33. \nADB  is  also  providing  additional  COVID-19  support  to  the  government.  An  additional \nfinancing of $200 million is being processed for the Social Protection Support Project, allowing \nthe  government  to  scale  up  cash  transfers  to  Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program  (4P) \nbeneficiaries, which total more than 4 million households with 85.3% women beneficiaries.28 ADB \nis also processing a proposed $125 million emergency health project to rapidly increase disease \nsurveillance  and  diagnostic  capacity,  infection  prevention  and  control,  and  procurement  of \nnecessary equipment. ADB has also provided a $3 million grant for the procurement of modern \nlaboratory  equipment  to  be  housed  at  the  Jose  B.  Lingad  Memorial  Regional  Hospital  in  San \nFernando City, which will help increase testing capacity by an additional 1,000 tests per day.29 In \naddition,  ADB  also approved  a rapid response  technical  assistance grant  for  $5  million,  which \nleverages private sector donations to provide food baskets to up to 140,000 vulnerable families \naffected by COVID-19 in the NCR.30 \n\n \n34. \nAlignment with Strategy 2030. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nspecifically priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality (through its support \nfor  social  protection  measures  and  objective  of  containing  the  rise  in  poverty  incidence), \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (through  support  for  cash  transfers  to  women  and \nmarginalized  groups  under  the  ESP),  and  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity \n(through support for strengthening medical institutions and health responses to COVID-19).  \n \nC. \n \nDue to the adverse impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s 2020 financing requirement of \n35. \nthe government is expected to increase to \u20b11.9 trillion ($37.6 billion) from \u20b11.4 trillion. Domestic \nborrowing  will  increase  by  \u20b174.7  billion.  The  government  also  plans  to  increase  its  foreign \nborrowing  by  \u20b1129.2  billion  ($2.6  billion)  to  finance  its  COVID-19  response  program.

For  the  first  US  dollar-\ndenominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount factor \nis  7.82  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  For  the  second  US  dollar-\ndenominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount factor \nis 4.34 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The first Euro-denominated loan \nwill have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years and the second Euro-denominated \nloan will have a 5-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; both with an annual interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. For \nthe first Euro-denominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% \ndiscount factor is 7.82 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. For the second \nEuro-denominated loan, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount \nfactor is 4.34 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loans are expected \nto be disbursed in April 2020 ($1 billion) and June 2020 ($500 million) based on government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response financing needs. The total loan size is based on the Philippine\u2019s financing \nneeds, and development spending arising from the development expenditure program.  \n \n\n31 \u20ac0.926526 = $1.00 as of 13 April 2020. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\nDebt sustainability. A recent debt sustainability assessment by the IMF confirmed that \n37. \nthe Philippines\u2019 debt levels are sustainable, although the pandemic is expected to elevate overall \ndebt levels (footnote 24). Debt as a percentage of GDP has trended downwards in recent years, \nwith a debt stock that is heavily weighted to longer tenors and domestic currency issues. Under \nnew assumptions reflecting the effect of COVID-19, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase \nto 41.5% in 2020 before eventually falling to 39.6% by 2024. Gross international reserves totaled  \n$87.8 billion at the end of December 2019 and represented 5.1 times the cover of short-term debt \nunder the original maturity concept. The debt service ratio improved to 6.5% from 6.6% for the \nsame  period  year-on-year.32 Adding  $1.5 billion  in  additional  debt  under  the  proposed  CARES \nprogram  represents  an  increase  of  0.4%  of  the  total  outstanding  balance.  As  a  percentage  of \nGDP,  this  additional  debt  would  increase  the  2020  public  debt-to-GDP  level  to  41.9%  from  a \nbaseline of 41.5%, before falling to 39.9% by 2024. This increase would not significantly alter the \noutcomes of the debt scenarios modeled by the IMF.33  \n \nD. \n \nThe Philippines  has  adopted the WHO  Strategic  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  for \n38. \nCOVID-19, with a society-wide coordination mechanism. WHO leads the coordination mechanism \nwith the Incident Management  Team  and  the  Emergency Operating  Center  established by the \nDOH. The DOH also leads the national contingency planning process in close collaboration with \nthe  National  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  Management  Council.  This  process  involves  relevant \ngovernment, private sector, and non-governmental actors. WHO is complementing government \nefforts through  its  Humanitarian Country  Team. It  established a  planning mechanism  aimed  at \ncoordinating  contributions  by  United  Nations  agencies,  non-governmental  organizations,  and \ndonors to support implementation of the national contingency plan. In addition, the United Nations \nhas  established  an  inter-agency  task  force  on  socioeconomic  impact  of  COVID-19  with  the \nparticipation  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  to  ensure  responses  are  well-aligned  and \ncomplementary.  The  ADB  team  has  consulted  and  coordinated  closely  with  the  IMF  on  the \nPhilippines\u2019  macroeconomic  situation.34 The IMF mission confirmed the  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement  and  fiscal  and  debt  position  of  the  Philippines  and  endorses  the  government\u2019s \nplanned countercyclical expenditure program. At the request of the Government of Philippines, \nthe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has indicated its intention to provide cofinancing \nfor  the  CARES  program,  with  the  size  of  the  loan  yet  to  be  determined.  AIIB  will  disburse  its \ncofinancing directly to the Government. \n \nE. \n \n39. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency for the CARES program. \nA coordinating and monitoring framework has been established between the Government of the \nPhilippines  and  ADB  to support  effective  implementation  of  COVID-19  response  and  recovery \nplan as captured in the CARES program.35 The mechanism is a venue to share information and \nreport on the implementation of the COVID-19 response and recovery plan, and seeks inputs for \nchanges or improvements. ADB will share experience and updates from other countries and help \nthe government refine response and recovery plans. The framework will also be used to channel \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nprimary income. \n\n \n\n32 The debt service ratio relates principal and interest payments to exports of goods and receipts from services and \n\n33 A  more  detailed  discussion  is  provided  in  Public  Financial  Management  and  Debt  Sustainability  Assessment \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n34 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Country Engagement Framework for COVID-19 Response (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n16 \n\n2). \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s support in the implementation of the plans, as an international partner and facilitator.

The policy committee will meet at least once quarterly and \nwill  consult  and seek  inputs from  relevant  stakeholders.  For  this  purpose,  it  will  form  technical \nworking groups (TWGs) based on priority issues in the agenda. The TWGs will meet as needed \nand will call for feedback and solicit inputs from relevant stakeholders from the private sector and \ncivil society organizations to help shaping the post-COVID-19 response measures.  The TWGs \nwill promote the availability, analysis, and the use of big data in combating COVID-19 effectively. \nThe  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  IATF-EID.  Monitoring  of  implementation  will  include \ntracking of sex-disaggregated data. The program implementation period is April 2020\u2013May 2021. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\ntechnical  efficiency,  while \n\nfiscal  discipline  and  allocative  and \n\n \nGovernance. The government continues to improve public financial management (PFM) \n40. \nand  public  sector  accountability  mechanisms.  PFM  reforms  implemented  between  2011\u20132016 \nstrengthened \nimproving \ntransparency and citizen empowerment. A 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \nassessment found that three of the seven core PFM areas have improved: policy-based budgeting, \ntransparency, and asset\u2013liability management.36 The government has set an aggressive reform \nagenda to promote effective and honest governance and to create an enabling environment for \ncitizens  and  the  private  sector.  The  framework  of  the  PFM  Roadmap,  2017\u20132022  aims  to \nstrengthen  the  foundation  of  the  PFM  system  by  focusing  on  three  components:  (i)  a  shift  to \nannual  cash  appropriations;  (ii)  automation  reform,  initially  through  the  Budget  and  Treasury \nManagement  System;  and  (iii)  the  creation  of  an  Office  of  the  Comptroller  General.  The  key \nreforms  target  improvements  in  costing,  cash  management,  planning  and  budgeting,  and \nprocurement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the DOF.  \n \n41. \nPoverty and social considerations. While the poverty rate in the Philippines declined \nfrom  25.2%  in  2012  to  23.3%  in  2015  and  16.6%  in  2018,  the  absolute  poverty  rate  and  the \nnumber  of  people  at  risk  remain  high.  Based  on  data  from  2018  on  pre-COVID-19  poverty \nestimates for 2020, there were 5.74 million poor and families (about 31.83 million individuals, of \nwhich 15.6 million are women); 17.6 million people are estimated to be living below the poverty \nline  and 14.23  million  live  just  above  and  are  vulnerable to  sliding  back  into  poverty.  Absolute \npoverty is at risk of increasing in the short term because of the weak labor market, critical food \nshortages, reduced or eliminated household earnings, and a drastic decline in remittances. Over \nthe medium term, a slow economic recovery risks prolonged high unemployment and suppressed \nearnings  in  the  informal  sector  as  new  labor  market  entrants  outnumber  new  jobs  created. \nStructural poverty may persist and worsen as poor families\u2019 access to social services is reduced \nand the total number in critical need of these services increases rapidly and exponentially. Further, \nthe  country  faces  significant  psycho-social  counseling  needs  due  to  anticipated  increases  in \nnegative  coping  strategies  throughout  the  crisis  period  including  heightened  rates  of  domestic \nand  gender-based  violence.  The  government\u2019s  COVID-19  response  program  will  have  an \nimmediate impact on the welfare of families and will help reach a large number of people most \n\n36 Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  Secretariat.  2016.

Specifically,  the  ESP  will \nprovide  unconditional  cash  transfers  to  support  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  while  unemployment \nbenefits, scholarships, and skills training grants will help at-risk populations to quickly make the \ntransition  back  into  employment  as  the  economy  recovers.  Effective  implementation  of  the \nCOVID-19 response will help to control poverty levels from spiking and return them to pre-crisis \nlevels more quickly.  \n \n42. \nGender. The proposed CARES program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming \nat  entry.  It  strengthens  the  government\u2019s  response  to  the  COVID-19  outbreak  by  addressing \ngender and social inclusion needs. The program aligns with the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act \nwhich expands essential unconditional cash transfer support to 18 million families, through the \nESP (see Box 2). The expanded social assistance will build on the 4P\u2019s framework for conditional \ncash transfers, which currently targets 4.4 million households, of which 85.3% of the beneficiaries \nare  women.  The  unconditional  cash  transfers  support  will  provide  the  4P  households,  and  an \nadditional 13.6 million households with cash grants of \u20b15,000\u2013\u20b18,000 per month. In keeping with \nthe 4P framework, where possible new transfer recipients will be women. However, the magnitude \nof need, the uncertainty of the full humanitarian impact of the pandemic, and the lack of adequate \ninfrastructure to facilitate targeted and efficient financial transfers will challenge efforts to reach \nthe populations in need quickly and effectively. The unconditional cash transfer support under the \nESP  (\u20b1205  billion)  will  be  partially  financed  through  ADB's  additional  financing  for  the  Social \nProtection  Support  Project  (\u20b110.1  billion).  A  portion  of  the  overall  CARES  program  support  \n(\u20b175.9  billion)  will  also  cover  some  of  the  additional  funding  required  (Table  4).  The  CARES \nprogram  will  endeavor  to:  (i)  ensure  effective  targeting  of  the  most  vulnerable  households \nincluding women-headed households; and (ii) consider the differential effects of the COVID-19 \nupon  women  and  men,  of  all  ages,  due  to  socially  constructed  roles  and  norms.  A  technical \nassistance from the COVID-19 TASF Special Pool Resources is being prepared to respond to the \ngendered impacts of COVID-19 including support for domestic and/or gender-based violence. \n \nSafeguards. The program will not have any adverse social or environmental impacts and \n43. \nwill  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  It  is  classified  category  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people safeguards. \n \n44. \nin Table 6 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37 \n \n\nRisks and mitigating measures.

If  the \nenhanced  community  quarantine  needs  to \nbe extended, significant downside risks exist \nincluding  higher  unemployment  and  lower \nincomes. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe government has introduced a robust and sequenced \nresponse to control the spread of the outbreak, starting \nwith  a  focused  effort  to  flatten  the  pandemic  curve  by \nintroducing the enhanced community quarantine for the \nentire  island  of  Luzon.  The  government  has  also  taken \nlimiting  both \nprecautions  such  as  dramatically \ninternational  and  domestic \nthe \nworsening of the outbreak.

Pre-shock record of \ngenerally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nBorder closures and international travel restrictions have significantly impacted global supply chains and \ntrade, bringing manufacturing and production of goods and services to a halt in many sectors. Tourism \nhas been particularly affected, as travel bans and quarantine requirements discourage any non-essential \nmovement. International arrivals in the Philippines dropped by 40% year-on-year in February 2020, and \nthis contraction is expected to double in March and April 2020. Conservative estimates suggest a decline \nin  tourism  revenues  by  as  much  as  $2.3  billion  dollars  or  0.7%  of  GDP.  Domestic  consumption  has \nplummeted due to both consumer fears as well as the enforcement of enhanced community quarantine \nin Metro Manila and other major urban centers. The NCR, which accounts for 37% of the total Philippines \neconomy, will experience a sharp contraction in March and April which could be extended until the end \nof quarter 2 depending on the speed and breadth of the virus\u2019s spread. Employment loss is projected to \nreach at least 4 million. Overall, the government expects GDP growth in the Philippines to fall from the \noriginal estimate of 6,2% in 2029 to -1.0%. This could push the economy into recession for the first time \nsince  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  pandemic  is  putting  significant  fiscal  pressure  on  the \nGovernment, which is expected to borrow a record \u20b11.9 trillion. Growing uncertainty in financial markets \nis constraining liquidity options for the government.       \nThe government has laid out a strong countercyclical support program of expenditures to mitigate the \nnegative  economic  impact  of  the  pandemic,  totalling  655.6  billion  ($12.8  billion).  Examples  includes:  \n(i) immediate social assistance such as wage subsidies and financial support, social security funds to \ncover  unemployment  benefits  for  dislocated  workers,  and  scholarships  to  support  affected  and \ntemporarily displaced workers through upskilling and reskilling; (ii) cash transfers for 17.9 million at-risk \nfamilies;  (iii)  economic  support  for  industries  and  workers  most  affected  by  the  pandemic  including \ntourism, agriculture, and fisheries; and (iv) increasing access to finance for micro and small enterprises, \nand (v) resources to protect critical public spending and provide economic stimulus. About 31% of the \npackage, $4 billion, is in the form of emergency cash assistance for poor and vulnerable households.      \nThe Philippines has a strong record of sound macroeconomic management. The economy expanded by \n6.3%  on  average  between  2010\u20132019,  accelerating  from  4.5%  between  2000\u20132009  and  3%  in  the \n1990s. At the same time, the government has carefully managed inflation, which was just 2.5% in 2019. \nWhen headline and core inflation rose above targets in 2018 due to increases in food and energy prices, \nthe government responded with a series of interest rate increases and structural reforms, including the \nenactment of the rice tariffication law and strengthening of the operational monetary policy framework to \nquickly address the situation. A fiscal consolidation strategy undertaken between 2010\u20132016 has helped \nto enforce good fiscal discipline.

The stock  of  central  government  debt  in  the \nPhilippines  has  declined  from  52.4%  of  GDP  in  2010  to  just  38.9%  of  GDP  in  2019,  reflecting  the \ncommitment of successive administrations to prudent macro-fiscal management. Tax collections have \nalso begun to increase as the government implements its comprehensive national tax reform agenda, \nincluding the TRAIN law. Tax\u2013GDP ratio has increased from 13.6% in 2015 to 15.0% in 2019, with the \nTRAIN law contributing an additional \u20b1180 billion during its first year of implementation. \nThe government has implemented a robust response to control the spread of the virus and provide urgent \nmedical support to affected populations. It has collaborated closely with the World Health Organization \non it\u2019s response to the crisis. An Inter-Agency Contingency Plan for Emerging Infectious Diseases and \nCOVID-19 was prepared on 27\u201328 February 2020. Key  health sector priorities include increasing the \ncountry\u2019s diagnostic capacity to determine the presence of the COVID-19 in patients, enhancing infection \ncontrol measures in hospitals and other health facilities, expanding the treatment capacity for COVID-19 \ncases particularly mild and severe cases, and  mobilizing financing for health care providers from the \nDepartment of Health, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, local governments, and other sources, \nand  implementing  risk  and  other  communication  interventions.  Some  \u20b135.8  billion  has  been  initially \nallocated for priority health and medical services.  \n \nOn 8 March 2020, the Department of Health raised the COVID-19 Alert System to Code Red sub-level \n1  to  prepare  for  possible  increase  in  suspected  and  confirmed  cases  in  the  country  and  to  facilitate \nresource  mobilization,  including  procurement  of  critical  logistics  and  supplies.  On  9  March  2020,  the \nPresident  declared  a  State  of  Public  Health  Emergency,  allowing  for  implementation  of  mandatory \nreporting,  intensify  government response  and  measures,  and  enforce  quarantine  and  disease  control \nprevention measures. On 13 March 2020, with 64 confirmed cases, the government raised the COVID-\n19 Alert System to Code Red sub-level 2 and imposed community quarantine in NCR for 1 month and \nstringent  social  distancing  measures  including  suspension  of  classes,  mass  gatherings,  and  non-\nessential work, and restriction on land, domestic air, and sea travel to and from NCR. The lockdown was \neventually expanded to the whole island of Luzon with several provinces, cities, and municipalities in \nVisayas and Mindanao imposing similar local-level lockdowns. \n \nBesides  support  for  the  health  sector,  the  government\u2019s  response  package  has  4  distinct  blocks  of \nsupport focused on social assistance, small business relief, poor farmers, and local governments. The \ngovernment has established an Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious \nDiseases to coordinate implementation of their COVID-19 responses. \nA recent debt sustainability assessment by ADB conducted in March 2020 confirmed that the Philippines\u2019 \ndebt levels are sustainable.   Debt as a percentage of GDP has continued its downward trend, with a \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n6. Coordination with \nthe International \nMonetary Fund \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \ndebt stock that is heavily weighted to longer tenors and domestic currency issues.  According to the IMF, \n\u201cPrudent fiscal management and strong growth are expected to reduce the general government gross \ndebt-to-GDP ratio from 38.9% of GDP in 2018 to 37.5% in 2024\u201d. Likewise, external debt was expected \nto fall to 19.1% of GDP in 2024, from 23.9% in 2018. Total outstanding debt to gross national income \nwas only 19.4% in 2019 and the debt stock exhibited a favorable maturity profile. The weighted average \nmaturity  stood  at  16.7  years,  down  slightly  from  17.1  years  during  the  previous  quarter.  Gross \nInternational Reserves stood at $87.8 billion as of end-December 2019 and represented 5.1 times cover \nof  short-term  debt  under  the  original  maturity  concept.  The  debt  service  ratio  improved  to  6.5%  from \n6.6%  for the same  period a year  ago.  As  a  percent  of GDP,  this  $1.5  billion  additional  debt from  the \nproposed  CPRO  assistance  would  increase  the  2020  public  debt\u2013GDP  level  to  41.9%  of  GDP  from \nbaseline of 38.9% of GDP, before falling to 39.9% of GDP by 2024. This increase would be immaterial \nand would not significantly alter the outcomes of the debt scenarios modelled by the IMF. \nADB  and  the  IMF  coordinate  closely  on  macroeconomic  monitoring  and  surveillance,  including  in \nassessing  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  economy  and  government  finances.  The  government  is  in \ncontact with the IMF on the ongoing measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADB team \nhas  consulted  and coordinated  closely  with the IMF  on the  Philippines\u2019  macroeconomic situation  and \nfuture process. The IMF mission confirmed the sound macroeconomic management, and fiscal and debt \nposition of the Philippines, and endorses the government\u2019s planned countercyclical support expenditure \nprogram. \n\nCOVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  CPRO  =  Countercyclical  Support  Facility\u2013COVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  IMF \n= International Monetary Fund, NCR = National Capital Region, TRAIN = Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 16 April 2020) \n", "Currency unit \n\u20b11.00 \n$1.00 \n\u20ac1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n= \n", "peso (\u20b1) \n$0.01972 or \u20ac0.01808 \n\u20b150.70 \n\u20b155.3137 \n", "4P \nADB \nAIIB \nBSP \nCARES \nCOVID-19 \nCPRO \nDOF \nDOH \nECQ \nESP \nGDP \nIATF-EID \n", "IMF \nLIBOR \nMSMEs \nNCR \nPFM \nPPE \nPRC \nPUI \nSARS \nTRAIN \nTWG \nUS \nWHO \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "coronavirus disease  \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nDepartment of Finance \n", "Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Department of Health \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "enhanced community quarantine \nEmergency Subsidy Program \ngross domestic product \nInter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging \nInfectious Diseases \nInternational Monetary Fund \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n\u2013  National Capital Region \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n", "public financial management \npersonal protective equipment \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nperson under investigation \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome \nTax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion \ntechnical working groups \nUnited States \n", " \nNOTE \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars. \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirectors \n", " \nTeam leaders \n \n", "Team members \n \n", " \nPeer reviewer \n", " \n", "Ahmed M.
