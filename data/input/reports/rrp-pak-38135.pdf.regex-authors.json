A general overview of the environmental impacts of \nAssessment  various  components,  along  with  the  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) of two sample subprojects, is summarized as \ncore Appendix 15 with details in Supplementary Appendix C. The \nIEEs of all subprojects will be carried out in accordance with the \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures framework in  \nAppendix 10. \n   \nProject Description  This  is  the  first  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-supported \ninvestment  project  in  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK).  The \nProject  will  make  concerted  efforts  in  rehabilitating  and \nreconstructing  essential  physical  and  social  infrastructure  that \ncould not be maintained during more than five decades mainly due \nto lack of security in the region. The Project has been formulated \non the basis of a package of especially urgent needs in health, \neducation,  water  supply,  roads,  and  power  sectors  to  fill  the \ninvestment gap created over the past five decades in the above \nsectors.  Such  investments,  together  with  the  needed \nstrengthening of related public agencies, are expected to provide \nthe  basis  for  sustainable  economic  growth  and  help  reduce \npoverty in AJK. \n   \nRationale  Due to security problems and the low level of investment in social \nand  physical  infrastructure,  AJK  has  lagged  behind  in \ndevelopment  and  suffered  from  damage  to  infrastructure  and \ndisplacement of people. Such damage has hampered the effective \ndelivery of urban and rural services and considerably increased \nthe poverty level.  Hundreds of kilometers of roads, dozens of \nbridges,  hundreds  of  schools,  several  health  units  and  water \nsupply  systems  are  badly  deteriorated.  The  health  sector  is \nconstrained as none of the district hospitals has a proper accident \nand  emergency  department  to  efficiently  handle  emergencies. \nEvery year about 4,000 people die and a greater number suffer \nfrom some kind of disability. Important departments like pediatrics, \ngynecology,  and  operation  theaters  lack  essential  basic ", "iv \nequipment. The situation of some tehsil (subdistrict) hospitals is \neven  worse.  The  education  sector  is  facing  serious  financial \nconstraints  in  repairing  seriously  damaged  school  buildings. \nFurthermore, about 80% of all the schools have no facilities for \nsafe drinking water and sanitation. Students, particularly girls, face \nserious  problems.  Existing  water  supply  networks  and  water \ntreatment plants in all the urban towns are in a poor condition. \nTyphoid,  hepatitis,  cholera,  and  other  gastrointestinal  water-\nrelated  diseases  have  reached  an  alarming  level.  Regarding \ntransportation, the mountainous terrain and river valleys in AJK \nrequire  a  significantly  large  number  of  bridges  to  provide  the \ndesired level of connectivity to rural areas representing about 87% \nof  the  AJK  population,  and  to  achieve  economic  and  social \nbenefits from better access to markets, schools, and hospitals and \nthus  reduce  poverty.  Several  deteriorated  roads  need  urgent \nrehabilitation. The current power distribution network supplies poor \nquality and unreliable power due to high system losses, frequent \noutages, and significant voltage drops, which had been a major \nconstraint to economic and social development. Current system \nlosses  are  about  37%.  The  Government  of  AJK  (AJKG)  has \nprepared a plan\u2014Improvement, Renovation, and Augmentation of \nPower Distribution Network in AJK\u2014for which external financial \nassistance is urgently required. \n \nThree major steps need to be taken to address the above issues: \n(i) urgent financing to address the existing significant backlog in \nbasic social and physical infrastructure; (ii) strengthening of public \nagencies  through  extensive  analysis  of  existing  issues, \ninefficiencies,  constraints,  and  accordingly  undertaking  specific \nmeasures and training considering best practices in regions under \nsimilar  conditions;  and  (iii)  strong  government  commitment  to \nsustained operation and maintenance, public participation in all \nphases of development projects, cost recovery, and monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E) of the technical and financial operations and \naccordingly taking timely actions for ensuring the overall sustained \noperations.  Such measures are expected to provide the basis for \nsustainable economic growth and help to reduce poverty in AJK. \nFor this purpose the Government of Pakistan (the Government) \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to extend financial \nassistance for addressing the priority issues by processing a fast \ntrack  project  for  AJK  in  2004.  In  response,  ADB  fielded  a \nReconnaissance Mission in April 2004 and the Loan Fact-Finding \nMission in May-June 2004 aiming to complete the loan processing \nwithin 2004.    \n   \nObjective  The Project aims to improve living conditions, quality of life, and \neconomic prospects in AJK by rehabilitating and reconstructing \nessential  physical  and  social  infrastructure  that  have  been \ndamaged  by  decades  of  neglect.  The  Project  will  allow  rapid \nimprovement in the well-being of about 3.4 million people in AJK, \nmainly low-income communities. The Project will improve AJK\u2019s \nhuman  capital  base  and  contribute  to  the  attainment  of  the ", "v \nMillennium Development Goals by enhancing the quality of and \naccess to social services. It will also boost economic growth by \nrehabilitating roads and power networks. \n \nThe  Project  will  comprise  the  following  components:  (i) \nrehabilitation and improvement of health services, which includes \nextension  and  rehabilitation  of  accident  and  emergency \ndepartments of eight district headquarter (DHQ) hospitals and four \nselected  tehsil  headquarters  (THQ)  towns  hospitals;  (ii) \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  of  education  services,  which \nincludes  rehabilitation/reconstruction/improvement  of  selected \nprimary,  middle,  and  high  schools;  (iii)  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  of  water  supply  systems,  which  includes \nrehabilitation and extension of the existing water supply networks \nand treatment plants in seven DHQ towns and four THQ towns; \n(iv) rehabilitation of roads and bridges; and (v) rehabilitation and \nimprovement of the power distribution network. Assessment of the \ninstitutional capacity of each implementing agency (IA) has been \ncarried out and each component includes the required actions for \nstrengthening institutional capacity to ensure sustainability of the \nexisting and rehabilitated infrastructure. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $76 million equivalent, \nof which $33.5 million is in foreign currency, and $42.5 million \nequivalent is in local currency.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  33.5  23.5  57.0  75 \nGovernment  of  Azad  0  19.0  19.0  25 \nJammu and Kashmir \nTotal  33.5  42.5  76.0  100 \n \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  38,031,000  ($57  million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest rate charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  ADB will provide the loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, \nTerms  which will make the loan proceeds available to AJKG on the same \nbasis as for past foreign assisted projects in AJK in which AJKG \nhas not been required to repay the loans or pay any interest on \nservices charges to the Government. The Government will bear \nany foreign exchange risk. \n   ", "vi \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Planning and Development Department (P&D) of AJK will be \nthe coordinating Executing Agency (EA) for the entire Project. The \nImplementing Agency (IA) will be the Department of Health for \ncomponent A, the Education Department for component B, the \nPublic  Works  Department  for  components  C  and  D,  and  the \nElectricity  Department  for  component  E.  For  the  suspension \nbridges and footbridges under component D, the IA will be the \nLocal Government and Rural Development Department. Each IA \nwill establish a project implementation unit (PIU) to implement its \nrespective project component. \n   \nImplementation  P&D  will  establish  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  as  its \nArrangements  secretariat.  The  PCU,  comprising  professional  staff  with  the \nsupport of a team of consultants, will assist IAs by giving them \ntechnical support and guidance in implementing project activities; \nundertake institutional strengthening for them; and support M&E. \nThe  PIU  of  each  IA  will  execute  the  project  activities.  The \nconsultants  will  help  the  PIUs  prepare  detailed  designs,  and \nprocurement for civil works, equipment, and materials. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and the Government\u2019s \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nCivil works under components A, B, C, and D, are not likely to \nattract international contractors because of the wide geographic \nspread of the subprojects and small size of the packages, and \nbecause of the security and other frequently changing matters \nrelevant  to  accessing  the  project  area.  In  addition,  detailed \ndesigns  for  certain  works  will  not  be  prepared  before  bidding; \nrather, works will be bid based on simple standard designs and \nquantities and will be refined during construction. Therefore, local \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB will be the preferred \nmode.  Similarly,  supply  contracts  are  unlikely  to  attract \ninternational suppliers because of difficult security conditions in the \narea. For components A and E, where equipment for hospitals and \nthe power distribution network is required, as much as possible \nprocurement will be undertaken using local competitive bidding \nprocedures or international shopping as appropriate. \n   \nConsulting Services  An input of 1,340 person-months of domestic consulting services \nis planned. Consultants to be financed under the Project will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with the quality- and cost-\nbased selection (QCBS) method of ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  or  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. \n   ", "vii \nProject Benefits and  About 46% of the households in AJK live below the poverty line.  \nBeneficiaries  Low-income  rural  and  urban  communities  live  in  underserved \nsettlements with poor infrastructure facilities and services. Areas \nthat have faced the most security issues experience poverty levels \nestimated to range from 70% to 90%, much higher than that for \nthe rest of AJK. The field surveys during the Loan Fact-Finding \nMission demonstrated that the majority of the existing physical and \nsocial infrastructure were either damaged or have long passed \ntheir useful life. Until this infrastructure is restored, it will not be \npossible  for  communities  in  the  areas  to  restore  their  living \nconditions, even to a very basic level, and begin the long process \nof catching up with the development that has been available to the \nrest of the country for the past more than five decades. \n \nThe Project will improve living conditions and the quality of life of \nabout 3.4 million people in AJK by rehabilitating and reconstructing \nessential physical and social infrastructure affected by decades of \nneglect. The improved roads will provide both urban and rural \ncommunities with access to better health and education services. \nThe  beneficiaries  of  power  rehabilitation  are  industry,  fishery, \nagriculture, livestock production, housing, education, health, water \nsupply, and irrigation. Improved water supply and good quality \nwater will decrease waterborne diseases. The savings on medical \nexpenses of poor households could be used for family well-being. \nThe  improved  quality  of  and  access  to  drinking  water  of  poor \ncommunities in the project area will reduce the time women spend \nin fetching water. Improved hospital and health services will have \ngreater impact on the health condition of the population in the \nproject area. Improved pediatric and the gynecological services \nwill improve the health conditions of children and their mothers. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks associated with the Project follow: \n(i)  the security situation may again worsen and delay project \nimplementation; \n(ii)  given that this is ADB\u2019s first operation in AJK, the Project \nfaces some implementation risk, and the capacity of IAs \nmay not be sufficiently improved to implement the Project \nsuccessfully; and \n(iii)  IAs may not successfully address minor land acquisition \nand  resettlement  issues  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement framework (Appendix 11). \n \nTension is considered unlikely to return in the near future. With \nregard to the implementation risk and capacity of IAs, the Project \nwill  engage  design  and  implementation  consultants,  and  non-\ngovernment organizations to support each IA and its PIU. Several \nIAs have experience with internationally funded projects. For all \nsubprojects  requiring  land  acquisition  or  resettlement,  land \nacquisition and resettlement plans will be prepared. These would \nbe submitted to ADB for approval before any land acquisition or \ndisplacement takes place. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Multisector Rehabilitation and Improvement Project for \nAzad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Due to lack of security, and a low level of investment in social and physical infrastructure, \nAJK  has  lagged  behind  in  development  and  suffered  from  damage  to  infrastructure  and \ndisplacement of people. The situation has hampered the effective delivery of urban and rural \nservices and considerably increased the poverty level. Hundreds of kilometers of roads, dozens of \nbridges, hundreds of schools, several health units, and power and water supply systems are badly \ndeteriorated. Sustained investments to bridge gaps in various sectors, with priority on rehabilitation \nof existing deteriorated infrastructure and strengthening of public agencies, are expected to provide \nthe basis for sustainable economic growth and help reduce poverty in AJK. For this purpose, the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  (the  Government)  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nextend financial assistance for addressing the priority issues by processing a fast-track project for \nAJK in 2004. In response, ADB fielded a Reconnaissance Mission in April 2004 and the Loan Fact-\nFinding Mission in May-June 2004. The proposed Project (the project framework is in Appendix 1) \nis the first development assistance of ADB in AJK. It represents the outcome of wide consultation \nwith  stakeholders  including  the  people  and  their  elected  representatives,  non-government \norganizations (NGOs), and the concerned departments of the government of AJK (AJKG) and the \nGovernment. \n \n3.  The  Ministry  of  Kashmir  Affairs  and  Northern  Affairs  serves  as  a  link  between  the \nGovernment and AJKG. AJK has a parliamentary form of government, with the President as the \nconstitutional head, and the Prime Minister, supported by a council of ministers, as the chief \nexecutive. AJK has two divisions (Muzaffarabad and Mirpur) and seven administrative districts, \nwith Muzaffarabad City as the capital.1 AJK has a population of about 3.4 million people, 87% of \nwhom live in rural areas with no indigenous people. The majority of the rural population depend on \nforestry and agriculture for their livelihood. The average per capita income is only between $200 \nand $250, half the average income of a Pakistani. With the mountainous terrain and scattered rural \nsettlements  and  a  few  major  urban  centers,  poverty  is  fairly  evenly  distributed  across  AJK. \nUnemployment  ranges  from  35  to  50%.  The  latest  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP) report shows that Pakistan\u2019s human development index rank has dropped to 144 among \n175 countries, and is lower than that of other countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh, India, \nand Sri Lanka. In line with the national trends, indicators of social sector achievement in AJK did \nnot improve much in the 1990s. Sustained effort for social sector development will be required in \nAJK, considering that the literacy rate is 62%, infant mortality rate is 56 per 1,000 live births, and \nimmunization rate for children under 2 years is 46%. \n \nA.  Existing Situation \n4.  Health.  AJK  has  a  reasonable  network  of  primary  health  care  services,  including  an \nadequate  network  of  referral  hospitals.  However,  none  of  the  district  hospitals  has  a  proper \nAccident  and  Emergency  Department  for  efficiently  handling  different  types  of  emergencies \nincluding  obstetric  emergencies.  Important  departments  like  pediatrics,  cardiac  and  operation \ntheaters lack essential basic equipment. Furthermore, accommodations for doctors, paramedics, \nand nurses are limited in most hospitals. The situation of tehsil hospitals is even worse, particularly \nin Athmuqam, Burnala, Fatehpur, and Kahuta. Many have been partly or completely damaged. \n                                                 \n1  AJK has 7 districts and 18 tehsils or subdistricts. Districts and tehsils are local government units under a corporate \nmunicipal administration. ", "2  \nDue to lack of access to proper health services, every year a large number of people die in those \nareas. The most vulnerable groups like women and children have been greatly affected. Major \nproblems and weaknesses of tehsil hospitals include limited inpatient facilities; absent or non-\nfunctioning  operation  theaters;  lack  of  diagnostic  services  like  X-ray  machine  and  laboratory \nfacilities;  no  proper  buildings  for  an  outpatient  department  (OPD)  and  administrative  staff; \nabsence/shortage of doctors, nurses, and paramedics due to lack of accommodations; and lack of \nincentives to work in remote and isolated areas. \n \n5.  On the average, 75,000 patients are admitted in district hospitals every year; out of them, \n32,000 are for some form of emergency. Due to the limited capacity of accident and emergency \ndepartments, every year about 4,000 people die and a greater number suffer from some kind of \ndisability. Out of the annually reported 500 serious burn cases, more than 50% die due to the \nabsence of life-saving equipment. Many lives could be saved and disabilities prevented if the \naccident and emergency departments are rehabilitated, the transportation system improved with \nadequate ambulances, adequate number of doctors and paramedical staff posted and trained, and \nessential life-saving equipment made available. AJKG needs urgent external financing for the \nrehabilitation  of  accident  and  emergency  departments  in  all  eight  district  headquarter  (DHQ) \nhospitals, rehabilitation of four seriously damaged tehsil (THQ) hospitals, accommodations for \ndoctors and nurses in remote areas, and specific training for staff to enhance their technical \ncapacity. \n \n6.  Education. AJK\u2019s literacy rate is estimated to be 62%, about 56% among females and 80% \namong males. Only 10% of females and 18% of males complete high school and only 4% of \nwomen and 13% of men are able to go beyond high school. Education has been a priority area of \nthe AJKG as about 27% of its total recurring budget is allocated to that sector. However, AJKG \nfaces serious financial constraints for repair/reconstruction of school buildings that have been \nseriously damaged. About 900 schools (primary, middle, and high schools) require urgent repair \nand furniture and equipment. Shortage of funds and climatic factors like heavy snowfall/rainfall \nhave rendered many of these buildings unusable and dangerous. Furthermore, about 80% of all \nthe  schools  in  AJK  have  no  facilities  for  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation  and  students, \nparticularly girls, face serious difficulties, which result in absenteeism and other problems such as \nserious  waterborne  diseases.  AJKG  requires  urgent  financial  assistance  to  repair  dangerous \nschool buildings where hundreds of students are at high risk, provide water and sanitation for all \nschools, train teaching staff, and build the capacity of the education department.  \n \n7.  Water Supply and Drainage. The existing water supply network and water treatment \nplants in all major towns in AJK are in poor condition, and in most areas the quality of water does \nnot meet the prescribed World Health Organization standards. A survey of hospitals carried out \nduring  the  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission  indicates  that  typhoid,  hepatitis,  cholera,  and  other \ngastrointestinal water-related diseases have reached an alarming level. Despite the abundance of \nwater throughout the year in streams and river tributaries, almost all urban centers face water \nscarcity.  Residents  of  unserved  settlements  have  to  rely  on  unsafe  sources,  such  as  rivers, \ncontaminated  open  wells,  springs,  and  natural  streams.  Contamination  of  water  source(s), \nintermittent supply, intermixing of sewerage and water pipelines due to inadequate spacing and \nfaulty  joints  and  old  leaking  pipes  are  major  issues  that  require  urgent  attention.  The  AJKG \ncontinues to spend funds from its annual development program (ADP) to improve water supply \nservice, but those are inadequate to completely address the deficiencies. It is urgent that the water \nsupply and sanitation systems be improved in a planned, systematic, and phased manner to ", "  3\nenhance living conditions and the quality of life of the urban communities in AJK2 and to strengthen \nthe capacity of the related agencies to ensure sustained delivery of services. \n \n8.  Roads  and  Bridges.  The  mountainous  terrain  and  river  valleys  in  AJK  require  a \nsignificantly large number of bridges to provide the desired level of connectivity to the rural areas, \nand to achieve economic and social benefits from better access to markets, schools, and hospitals, \nand thus reduce poverty. Currently, bridges are very few and most of them have already completed \ntheir useful life. Furthermore, destruction of roads and shortage of funds and limited capacity of the \nPublic Works Department (PWD) have resulted in severe deterioration of the road network. The \nsituation is exacerbated by poor construction quality and extreme climate conditions that result in a \nlarge backlog of road rehabilitation and reconstruction. At present, about $25 million is urgently \nneeded to rehabilitate priority roads and bridges, construct about 20 suspension bridges to link \nlarge rural communities to nearby urban centers, and build the capacity of` PWD to ensure that it \nevolves into an efficient road agency. Improvement of primary roads will reduce transportation \ncosts,  enhance  subregional  connectivity,  facilitate  trade,  and  promote  regional  peace  and \nharmony. \n \n9.  Power. The current power distribution network connects electricity to about 70% of the \npopulation and 95% of the villages. However, the network has not been adequately operated and \nmaintained due to insufficient investment and system losses are high; therefore the power supply \nis of poor quality characterized by frequent outages and significant voltage drops. The current \noverall  system  losses  of  the  power  distribution  network  are  in  the  level  of  37%,3  which  is \nunacceptably high and not sustainable. The losses are attributed to (i) insufficient grid stations, (ii) \nlengthy  and  overloaded  feeders/lines,  (iii)  damaged/overloaded  transformers,  (iv)  slow, \ndamaged/obsolete meters, (v) poor maintenance facilities, and (vi) inadequate billing systems. To \naddress (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v), AJK Electricity Department (AJKED) engaged a consulting firm in \n1995 to assess the state of various feeders and make plans for rehabilitating and augmenting the \ndistribution network. Survey and mapping of the existing distribution network are almost complete \nand engineering and detailed designs are expected to be completed by December 2004. On this \nbasis of the study, AJKED has prepared a plan\u2014Improvement, Renovation, and Augmentation of \nPower Distribution Network in AJK\u2014for which external financial assistance is needed. To address \nitem (i), the Water and Power Development Authority of the Government has prepared a plan for \naugmenting and expanding the grid stations in consultation with AJKED; to address item (vi), \nAJKED has initiated the development of a computerized billing system.  \n \n10.  Three major steps need to be taken simultaneously to address the above issues: (i) urgent \nfinancing to address the existing significant backlog of basic social and physical infrastructure; (ii) \nstrengthening  public  agencies  through  extensive  analysis  of  existing  issues,  inefficiencies, \nconstraints, and accordingly undertaking specific measures and training, keeping in view the best \npractices employed in the region under similar conditions; and (iii) securing the Government\u2019s \nstrong commitment to sustained operation and maintenance (O&M), public participation in all \nphases  of  development  projects,  cost  recovery,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  of  the \ntechnical and institutional operations and, as a result of M&E, taking necessary actions in a timely \nmanner to ensure overall sustained operations.   \n \n                                                 \n2  The World Bank has been addressing water and sanitation problems in rural areas in AJK since the early 1990s. For \nimproving drainage and sanitation and sewerage treatment, AJKG plans to undertake comprehensive feasibility \nstudies including environmental improvement works, with its annual development funds. \n3  Based on data provided by AJK Electricity Department (AJKED), technical losses are estimated at 20-22%, while \nadministrative losses are 15-17%.   ", "4  \nB.  The Government\u2019s Strategy \n11.  The Government is concerned about the low levels of social and communication services \nand  believes  that  greater  investment  will  accelerate  productivity  gains,  reduce  poverty,  and \npromote smaller, healthier, and better-educated families. For development to catch up in the \ncontext of the national plan, a Public Sector Development Program of PRs70 billion (about $1,218 \nmillion) was proposed for AJK, which was the minimum requirement to clear the accumulated \nbacklog. The 10-Year Perspective Development Plan (PDP) 2001-2011 of AJK, was formulated \nwithin the broad economic and social parameters of the national plan tailored to the specific needs \nand imperatives of the area as dictated by development goals and aspirations of the people. \nEfficient growth and improvement in the quality of life are the two main objectives of the PDP. \nThese objectives could be realized through improvement of infrastructure for growth in AJK; public \nservices like health, education, and water for all; and generation of employment opportunities.  The \ninvestment priorities of AJKG outlined in the PDP are hydroelectric power generation, transport \nand communication, education, health, water supply, rural development, resource management, \ninformation technology, industries, and agriculture. AJKG believes that greater investment in basic \nrural/urban development services will accelerate gains in productivity, reduce poverty, and improve \neconomic conditions in AJK.  The Project is formulated to support the Government\u2019s initiatives for \npoverty reduction and economic development in line with PDP 2001-2011. The Project will also \nhelp  AJKG  and  its  concerned  departments  build  confidence  for  undertaking  future  large \ninvestments. \n \nC.  External Assistance \n12.  International and domestic agencies have been working in AJK and supporting a wide \nrange of development and rehabilitation activities in various sectors. The United Nations High \nCommissioner  for  Refugees  and  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  play  a  vital \nhumanitarian and security role. Other agencies include the Food and Agriculture Organization, \nUnited  Nations  International  Children's  Emergency  Fund  (UNICEF),  UNDP,  World  Food \nProgramme, bilateral agencies, and large number of international and local NGOs. Appendix 2 \ngives more information. \n \n13.  The World Bank is supporting community-based social and economic infrastructure.  At \npresent, the World Bank is providing support to AJK through the Community Infrastructure Services \nProject,  Protected  Area  Management  (Machiara  Park),  and  Northern  Education  Project.  The \nInternational Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) is funding AJK Community Development \nProject, and UNICEF has extended assistance for Integrated Rural Water Supply. UNDP has \ncompleted  its  Area  Development  Program  in  AJK,  which  included  community  development, \nfisheries and sericulture development, human resource development, program coordination and \nstrengthening of the Planning and Development Department (P&D) of AJKG, and a microcredit \nprogram. The Program was implemented in both northern and southern parts of AJK. Another \nUNDP initiative for urban poverty reduction through the National Urban Poverty Alleviation Project \nwhich  is  at  start-up  stage,  focuses  on  development  of  human  resources  particularly  through \nstrengthening the technical skills of youth in information technology and other technical areas. \nBilateral  agencies,  including  France,  Norway,  and  the  United  Kingdom  are  also  supporting \nrehabilitation and extension of social and physical infrastructure in rural areas covering health and \neducation facilities, water supply and sanitation, agriculture, shelter, roads, and income generation. \n \n14.  A few NGOs are working in AJK. In recent years they have formed community-based \norganizations for implementing development projects on health, water, education, and community \ndevelopment.  Community  organizations  and  village  banks  have  been  formed  through  the \nmicrocredit program of IFAD. The efforts of NGOs and aid organizations have initiated a process \nfor involving local communities, especially the poor, in local level-development activities.    ", "  5\nD.  Lessons Learned \n15.  A  review  of  ADB-wide  experience  with  rehabilitation  assistance  indicates  that  projects \nshould (i) be prepared as quickly as possible, (ii) focus on restoring facilities, (iii) feature a flexible \nimplementation  process,  (iv)  provide  strong  consulting  support  and  ADB  supervision  during \nimplementation,  (v)  be  supported  by  equally  quick  action  by  the  Government,  and  (vi)  be \ncompleted entirely. \n \n16.  Other lessons learned from earlier assistance in Pakistan follow: (i) beneficiary participation \nmust  be  ensured  during  project  preparation  and  implementation;  (ii)  environment  and  social \naspects should be considered during implementation, since situations when rapid response is \nneeded may not be evident before the approval of the project; (iii) arrangements for disbursements \nshould give quick and simple access to funds; (iv) the adopted approach should permit flexible \nadjustment of project design during implementation; (v) criteria for subproject selection should \npermit  simple  prioritization  and  short  implementation  periods  but  ensure  a  balance  among \ncommunities and maximum benefits to the community; (vi) there is need for close and frequent \nmonitoring  to  ensure  transparency  and  facilitate  implementation;  and  (vii)  there  is  need  to \ncoordinate  the  large  number  of  government  and  externally  assisted  rehabilitation  and  new \nprograms in the  project areas, as well as the various sectors covered under the proposed Project. \nThe proposed Project has been carefully designed to reflect each of those lessons. \n \nE.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy \n17.  The focus of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (CSPU) for Pakistan (2004\u20132006) \nis on reducing poverty by providing assistance in key strategic areas of sustainable pro-poor \neconomic growth inclusive of social development. The strategy continues to be relevant and in line \nwith the new government\u2019s priorities. The proposed Project supports the focus of CSPU on the \nsectors of transport, and basic urban services. ADB\u2019s emphasis will remain on improving delivery \nof social services through increased public sector allocations.  Water for All: the Water Policy of the \nAsian Development Bank (2001) also supports ADB\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction by addressing \neach of the three framework elements of poverty reduction: pro-poor sustainable growth, social \ndevelopment, and good governance. The main focus of ADB assistance to the urban sector will be \non the environmental aspects and needs of the poor, and will also cover the attainment of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n18.  The objective of the Project is to improve living conditions, quality of life, and economic \nprospects in AJK by rehabilitating and reconstructing essential physical and social infrastructure \nthat have been damaged by decades of neglect.

Further Details are in Appendix 5.  \n \n4.  Component D: Rehabilitation of Roads and Bridges \n24.  The objectives of the road component are to give the rural population in AJK access to \nlivelihood and social services, thereby reducing poverty; and contribute to economic development \nthrough improved road infrastructure. Improving primary roads will reduce transportation costs, \nenhance subregional connectivity, facilitate trade, and promote regional peace and harmony. The \nroad component will cover rehabilitation and improvement of roads to provide inter- and intra-\ndistrict  links  and  thus  improve  subregional  connectivity;  and  construction  of  major  bridges, \nsuspension bridges for jeeps, and suspension footbridges to provide access to remote areas. \nPhysical improvements will be supplemented by institutional improvements in PWD. \n \n25.  This component will comprise (i) rehabilitation and improvement of a minimum of 130 \nkilometers (km) of the primary road network; (ii) construction/replacement of a minimum of 650 \nmeters (m) of major bridges on the primary roads; (iii) construction of about 1,050 m of suspension \nbridges for jeeps on secondary/tertiary roads; (iv) construction of about 1,050 m of suspension \nfootbridges to improve connectivity of remote communities; (v) policy reforms, capacity building for \nPWD, and improvements in civil works procurement procedures; and (vi) funding of recurrent \nexpenditure of the PIU and salaries of the PIU staff. Under item (vi), the Project will finance the \nsalaries of PIU staff on a declining basis: 100% during year 1, 75% in year 2, 50% in year 3, and \n25% in year 4. Details are in Appendix 6.  \n \n5.  Component E: Rehabilitation and Improvement of the Power Distribution \nNetwork \n26.  This component will help to reduce system losses and improve the reliability of the existing \npower distribution network through (i) rehabilitation and augmentation of about 750 km of 11 \nkilovolt  (kV)  lines;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  about  900  km  of  0.4  kV  lines;  (iii) \nreplacement and addition of 11 kV/0.4 kV transformers; (iv) rehabilitation and augmentation of \nservice connections; (v) procurement of necessary equipment and tools for adequate O&M of the \npower distribution network; (vi) consulting services for implementing this component and capacity \nbuilding of AJKED; and (vii) funding of recurrent expenditure of the PIU and salaries of the PIU \nstaff and required additional staff of the IA.

Special Features \n27.  This is the first ADB-supported investment project in AJK to make concerted efforts in \nrehabilitating and improving essential physical and social infrastructure that had been damaged by \ndecades of neglect. The Project has been formulated on the basis of a package of especially \nurgent needs that will fill the investment gap created over the past five decades in various sectors, \nwith priority on rehabilitation of existing deteriorated infrastructure. Such investments together with \nstrengthening of the respective public agencies are expected to provide the basis for sustainable \neconomic growth and help reduce poverty in AJK. \n ", "8  \n1.  Sector Loan Approach with Some Innovations \n28.  To meet the urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction needs, the Project will adopt a sector \napproach with some innovations.  This approach recognizes that rehabilitation needs differ among \nthe  sectors  covered  by  the  Project.  In  two  sectors  (health  and  water  supply)  where  urgent \nrehabilitation needs are concentrated in district headquarters, the project investments have been \nappraised as for a project loan. In three sectors (education, power, and roads) where urgent \nrehabilitation needs are scattered throughout AJK, a limited number of subprojects have been \nappraised during loan formulation for immediate implementation upon loan effectiveness as for a \nsector loan. For the appraisal, selection, and implementation of additional subprojects, selection \ncriteria and frameworks covering environmental assessment, land acquisition/resettlement, and \nfinancial and economic analyses have been developed and agreed to by AJKG and ADB. The \nframeworks will guide the selection and implementation of subprojects that will be appraised by the \nproject coordination unit (PCU) and the PIUs, with the help of the project management consultants \nand design/supervision consultants, and approved by the PCU in consultation with ADB. The first \ntwo  subprojects  in  each  sector  and  all  subprojects  above  the  agreed-upon  threshold  will  be \nreviewed and approved by ADB. The institutional capacity of IAs in AJK is considered adequate, as \nmany are already implementing internationally funded projects following the respective sector \npolicies. This approach differs from ADB\u2019s standard sector loan modality, which normally covers \nonly one sector and includes a detailed sector development plan. The Project will cover multiple \nsectors, and the policy dialogue will center on significant institutional strengthening for the line \nministries in AJK for prioritization of development projects and development of sector plans. This \napproach  recognizes  AJKG\u2019s  commitment  to  developing  a  systematic  policy  response  to \ndevelopment in AJK, as well as the need for flexibility in implementing the Project in a region that \nmust deal with significant infrastructure degradation. \n \n2.  Implementation and Institutional Capacity Building   \n29.  Although  several  IAs  do  have  experience  with  internationally  funded  projects,  but \nconsidering this is the first ADB-funded project in AJK, the project team has paid special attention \nto building implementation and institutional capacity in the IAs to ensure smooth implementation \nand sustainability of, not only the interventions under the Project but also those in all other existing \nand future projects. The Project will engage design and implementation consultants, and NGOs to \nsupport and train the IAs and the PIUs. Their work will focus on line agencies and deal with (i) \npreparation  of  the  subprojects,  including  appraisal,  conducting  due  diligence  for  all  aspects, \nfollowing ADB's safeguard policies; (ii) detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, and \nevaluation of bids; and (iii) construction supervision, including checking of adherence to safeguard \narrangements. The consultants will train staff engaged under the PCU and the PIUs. \n \n30.  The  planned  interventions  for  institutional  strengthening  are  as  follows:  (i)  health \ncomponent\u2014the capacity of doctors, nurses and paramedics, and Department of Health (DOH) \nstaff will be enhanced through training with a focus on management of trauma and emergency \ncritical care; the quality of all existing in-service training centers will be improved through provision \nof  teaching  aids  and  equipment,  and  training  of  trainers;  capacity  building  will  also  include \ninstitutionalizing a hospital asset management system; (ii) education component\u2014training will be \nprovided to the teaching staff including in-service training of follow-up learning material, developing \na  comprehensive  MIS,  improving  the  management  and  planning  capacity  of  the  education \ndepartment,  and  design  and  construction  of  civil  works,  and  strengthening  of  SMCs  through \ncommunity mobilization and training; quality-based bonus will be provided to primary teachers \nrecommended by SMC on the basis of their performance and application of training received; (iii) \nwater  supply\u2014planned  interventions  include  training  in  technical  and  financial  management, \nmapping  and  asset  management,  improving  municipal  financial  management  by  introducing \nimproved accounting procedures including budgeting, resource mobilization, enhanced O&M of ", "  9\nassets, and improved billing, revenue collection, and reporting systems; a detailed study on tariff \nsetting and demand analysis will be undertaken and regulatory systems will be established to \nensure that laws, standards, rules, and regulations are equitably and consistently applied; (iv) \nroads  and  bridges\u2014capacity  building  for  PWD  will  include  institutionalizing  a  road  asset \nmanagement  system,  training  in  technical  aspects,  project  management  and  contract \nadministration, and introduction of geographic information system; and (v) power component\u2014\nassistance  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  sector  governance,  enhance  AJKED\u2019s  financial \nperformance, and institute various programs and measures to improve its operating efficiency and \nperformance,  to  introduce  a  computerized  billing  system  and  improve  accounting  and  audit \nprocedures. Furthermore, institutional specialists will identify and fully analyze the list of needed \nreforms under each component, and prepare in consultation with the AJKG and ADB a plan for \nimplementing  key reforms under the Project and other reforms in future projects. \n \n31.  In the health, water supply, and power sectors, the Project addresses the issue of shortage \nof staff by extending funds for the salaries of essentially required additional staff on a declining \nbasis: 100% in year 1, 75% in year 2, 50% in year 3, and 25% in year 4. AJKG will retain and fully \nfinance staff from its recurring budget onward from year 5 of the Project. Thus, the AJKG will \ngradually  and  easily  absorb  this  staff.  Performance-based  incentives  (bonuses)  have  been \nproposed for teachers. Through SMCs, communities\u2019 involvement in construction and O&M of \nprimary  schools  will  help  ensure  good-quality  construction  and  sustainable  operations.  The \nproposed intensive training of all agencies, particularly in technical and financial management, will \nnot only ensure sustainability of project facilities, but also provide AJK agencies with confidence for \nexecuting similar large projects in the future.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n32.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $76 million equivalent including taxes and \nduties, of which $33.5 million equivalent (44.1%) is the foreign exchange cost including $1.4 million \nin interest charges during construction, and $42.5 million equivalent (55.9%) is the local currency \ncosts. Table 1 summarizes the estimated cost. Appendix 8 has the details. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA. Base Cost       \n1.

Financing Plan \n33.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 38,031,000 ($57 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources, which will represent 75% of the total cost of ", "10  \nthe Project. The ADB loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest rate charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.  \n \n34.  The loan will cover the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project in the amount of $33.5 \nmillion equivalent (including interest and other charges amounting to $1.4 million), and will finance \n$23.5 million equivalent, or 55.3%, of the local currency cost. The local currency cost to be \nfinanced by the ADB loan will cover portions of the civil works, vehicles, consulting services and \nproject management support, but excluding duties and taxes. ADB\u2019s financing of the local currency \nexpenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, which will address poverty, gender, and \nenvironment issues in the project areas.  \n \n35.  ADB will provide the loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will make the loan \nproceeds available to AJKG on the same basis as for past foreign assisted projects in AJK in which \nAJKG has not been required to repay the loans or pay any interest on service charges to the \nGovernment. The Government will bear any foreign exchange risk. Funds will be allocated to each \nIA as entitlement on the basis of estimated specific investment plans within the agreed-upon \nproject scope. The design of the funds to be utilized will create incentives for IAs to draw down the \nentitled shares, or otherwise lose shares because of poor performance. The unused shares may \nbe reallocated to other IAs, based on their performance evaluation.  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nADB  33.5  23.5  57.0  75 \nGovernment of AJK  0  19.0  19.0  25 \nTotal    33.5  42.5  76.0  100% \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, AJK = Azad Jammu and Kashmir. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  P&D of AJK will be the coordinating Executing Agency (EA) for the entire Project. The IAs \nwill be the DOH for component A, Education Department for component B, PWD for components C \nand  D,  and  AJKED  for  component  E.  For  the  suspension  bridges  and  footbridges  under \ncomponent D, the IA will be the Local Government and Rural Development Department (LGRDD). \nEach IA will establish a PIU to implement the respective project components. \n \n37.  P&D will establish a PCU headed by the full-time Project Coordinator, located at the P&D \nsecretariat, who will be recruited before the loan approval. The PCU, comprising five professional \nstaff and an accounts officer, will (i) act as a support unit for the PIUs by providing them guidance \nin implementing project activities and by facilitating interdepartmental coordination; (ii) provide \ntechnical support in recruiting consultants for PIUs, and through a technical group within PCU; (iii) \nundertake M&E of the project activities; and (iv) ensure compliance with safeguards including \nenvironmental (through close coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency - EPA), and \nland acquisition and resettlement. To ensure that gender issues are adequately addressed during \nproject preparation, design, and implementation, the existing women\u2019s cell in P&D headed by an \nassistant director will actively assist the PCU by liaising with all the PIUs and preparing and \nimplementing  the  respective  gender  action  plans  based  on  the  agreed-upon  gender  strategy \n(Appendix 9). ", " 11\n \n38.  Each PIU, headed by the project implementation officer, will comprise professional and \nsupport staff and will work in close collaboration with the respective department officials and PCU. \nThe PCU will provide each PIU an accounts officer and a technical support team of consultants, to \nassist  the  PIUs  in  preparing  detailed  designs  and  bidding  documents,  evaluating  bids  and \nawarding  contracts,  executing  project  components,  and  undertaking  environmental  and  social \nassessments in accordance with the environmental assessment review procedures framework \n(EARPF, Appendix 10) and resettlement framework and procedural guidelines (Appendix 11), \nrespectively, to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. The implementation framework \nof the Project is in Appendix 12. \n \n39.  A project steering committee (PSC)\u2014headed by the additional chief secretary of P&D, \nAJKG with a representative of the Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan, and secretaries \nfrom DOH, education department, PWD, LGRDD, AJKED, and finance, as members\u2014has been \nset up at P&D in Muzaffarabad to ensure smooth and orderly implementation besides providing \npolicy guidance and resolving interagency problems. The Project Coordinator will be the Secretary \nof the PSC. PSC meetings will be held as required, but at least once every 3 months. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n40.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  4  years,  and  will  be  completed  in \nDecember 2008. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 13. \n \n3.  Procurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n41.  Procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to ADB. Considering the urgent \nneed for the rehabilitation of infrastructure after many years of neglect in areas in AJK with security \nissues,  ADB's  procurement  guidelines  need  to  be  flexibly  interpreted.  For  civil  works  under \ncomponents A, B, C, and D, because of the wide geographic spread of the subprojects and small \nsize of the packages, and because of security and other frequently changing matters relevant to \naccessing the project area, the works are not likely to attract international contractors. In addition, \ndetailed designs for certain works will not be prepared before bidding; rather, works will be bid \nbased on simple standard designs and quantities, to be refined during construction. Therefore, \nlocal procurement using procedures acceptable to ADB will be the preferred mode. Similarly, \nsupply contracts are unlikely to attract international suppliers because of difficult security conditions \nin the area. Therefore, for components A and E, where equipment for hospitals and the power \ndistribution network  is required,  as  much  as  possible,  procurement  will  use  local  competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures or international shopping as appropriate. All procurement contracts will \ninclude standard anticorruption provisions. \n \n42.  Civil works for components A, B, C, and D will be packaged in a range of values, to suit the \nvarying capacities of domestic contractors.  Most civil works contracts will be below $1 million \nequivalent, except for a very few that may be in the range of $1 million\u2014$3 million. Civil works with \nestimated values of more than $1 million, but less than $3 million will be procured following LCB \nprocedures. Civil works with estimated values of less than $1 million may be procured either \nthrough LCB or by special procedures that may include community-based contracts,5 or similar \narrangements,  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  managed  small-scale  contractors  scheme  under  a \nsupervision  consultant  or  a  management  contractor  may  also  be  used.  LCB  civil  works \nprocurement will typically utilize single-stage, two-envelope procedures acceptable to ADB, and \nbidding periods of not less than 21 days. For procurement using international competitive bidding \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001. Project Administration Instruction, Procurement, para.  3.05, Appendix 2: A Guide on Community \nParticipation in Procurement), will be used as reference during implementation. ", "12  \n(ICB),  if  any,  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  procedures6  for  procurement  of  civil  works  without \nprequalification will be applied, with a bid submission period of 45 days. \n \n43.  Equipment and materials valued at more than $0.5 million equivalent will be procured under \nICB, those valued for $0.3 million-$0.5 million equivalent by international shopping, and those \nvalued at $0.3 million equivalent or less by local procedures acceptable to ADB. Appendix 14 \nshows the proposed contract packages.  \n \n44.  The standard bidding documents for subprojects under each component will be reviewed \none time by ADB to ensure that they remain current with ADB requirements. ADB\u2019s approval will be \nrequired for all civil works contracts valued at more than $500,000 for components A, B, and C, \nthose valued at $1,000,000 for components D and E, and all supply contracts valued at more than \n$300,000 for all components. ADB's approval will be initially required for the first two contracts for \ncivil works and supply contracts for each component valued at more than $300,000 and more than \n$100,000, respectively, before the award of the respective contracts. Once ADB is satisfied with \nthe procedures being followed by the P&D and the IAs, the dollar value limit for contracts requiring \nprior approval may be revised with the approval of ADB, based on demonstrated capacity. For \ncontracts valued at less than these agreed-upon approval amounts, the first contract package of \neach component will also be subject to ADB review and approval. For subsequent contracts, ADB \nwill review only annual work plans and undertake selective post facto reviews. However, if ADB \ndoes not approve the award or terms of any such contract, the Government will not use loan \nproceeds to finance such contract, and in the event that loan proceeds are used to finance such a \ncontract, the Government will refund to ADB any such payment. \n \n45.  Certain minor items of equipment, which are estimated to cost, in the aggregate, less than \nthe  equivalent  of  $100,000,  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase  in  accordance  with \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n46.  At the Government\u2019s request, ADB has approved advance action for procurement of civil \nworks and supply contracts, including inviting and receiving bids for contracts up to the stage of \nADB's  approval  of  the  IA's  recommendation  for  award  of  contract  before  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness. Advance action will help avoid initial start-up delays and facilitate award of most of \nthe contract packages immediately after loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised \nthat ADB\u2019s approval of advance action does not commit ADB to financing the Project or the \nprocurement costs.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n47.  To support project implementation, as well as build the capacity of the IAs, 1,340 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services will be required: (i) package A: project management and \nimplementation support to the PCU and the PIUs of components A and B, including subproject \ndetailed  design,  construction  supervision,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (650  person-months \nincluding 128 person-months for capacity building); (ii) package B: implementation support to the \nPIUs of components C, D, and E (690 person-months including 74 person-months of capacity \nbuilding). Supplementary Appendix A gives more details. \n \n48.  For  environmental  assessments,  monitoring  and  management,  36  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  assigned  to  the  PCU  to  assist  in  preparing  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  reports  for  various  subprojects  being  considered  for  ADB \nfinancing. The IEEs will be prepared in accordance with the agreed-upon EARPF (Appendix 10), \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  2002  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  2003,  and  AJKG \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.  Standard Bidding Document for Procurement of Civil Works. Manila. ", " 13\nregulations. The consultants will also assist in enhancing the capacity of concerned institutions in \nmonitoring  environmental  impacts  and  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs) in the IEEs. In this context the PIUs of the concerned line agencies \nand the AJK Environmental Protection Agency (AJKEPA) will be strengthened, as appropriate. \nAJKEPA will also assist in strengthening these line agencies.  \n \n49.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Because of the wide geographic spread of \nthe subprojects, and security and other frequently changing matters relevant to accessing the \nproject area, consulting services are unlikely to attract international firms. Adequate capabilities \nexist for these services to be provided by domestic consultants. \n \n50.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for the recruitment of \nconsultants. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance recruitment action \ndoes not commit ADB to financing the Project or the recruitment costs. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  The PCU will ensure that each IA will prepare disbursement projections, request budgetary \nallocations  for  counterpart  funds,  collect  supporting  documents,  and  prepare  withdrawal \napplications and send them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nJanuary 2001 as amended from time to time. Immediately after loan effectiveness. An imprest \naccount will be established at the National Bank of Pakistan, Muzaffarabad branch, for each of (i) \nP&D  for  PCU  and  project  coordination  expenses,  (ii)  DOH  for  component  A,  (iii)  Education \nDepartment for component B, (iv) PWD for component C and D, (v) LGRDD for suspension bridges \nand footbridges under component D, and (vi) Electricity Department for component E, in each case \nto meet eligible expenditures under the Project. The establishment of the imprest accounts will be \nsubject to the appointment of qualified account staff and the establishment of internal controls by \nPCU and each IA acceptable to ADB. The initial combined amount to be deposited into all imprest \naccounts will not exceed the lesser of 3 months estimated project expenditures or 10% of the loan \namount. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be used for reimbursing eligible \nexpenditures and liquidating advances provided into the imprest accounts. Any individual payment \nto  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000. The imprest accounts will be managed, replenished and liquidated in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001) as amended from time to time, and detailed \narrangements between the Government and ADB. \n \n52.  The PCU will disburse funds directly for the activities including capital and operating costs \nof the PCU; consultants, technical support team offices, capacity building and training activities, \nand related expenditures for monitoring, review, and evaluations. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  P&D and each IA will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify works, goods, \nand  services  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds.  Specifically,  P&D  and  each  IA  will  (i)  maintain \nseparate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that project accounts and financial statements are \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish the PCU for consolidation and delivery to ADB, not later than 6 \nmonths after the close of each fiscal year with certified copies of audited accounts and financial \nstatements and the report of the auditor on these, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of the \nimprest accounts and SOE procedures. \n ", "14  \n54.  P&D and each IA will prepare quarterly progress reports in a format acceptable to ADB, \nwhich will provide information on (i) progress made against established targets, including pre-\nidentified monitoring indicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve \nthem; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) proposed program of activities for the next \nquarter. The PCU will consolidate the reports of all IAs and deliver them to ADB. Within 3 months \nof physical completion of the Project, each IA will prepare a project completion report and submit it \nto the PCU for delivery to ADB.  \n \n7.  Selection and Approval of Subprojects \n55.  Since the Project will adopt a sector approach in the design and implementation of various \nsubprojects, subprojects will be selected on the basis of selection criteria agreed upon by the \nGovernment  and  AJKG,  and  set  out  for  each  component  in  Appendixes  3,  4,  5,  6,  and  7, \nrespectively. In addition, regardless of the sector, each subproject will be proposed on the basis of \nthe following general criteria: \n \n(i)  The subproject will rehabilitate or reconstruct damaged infrastructure, and/or directly \naddress the requirements of the people of AJK. The subproject will be the part of an \nannual plan proposed by the IA for the relevant component. \n(ii)  The subproject will have a clear economic rationale. The rationale will include an \nanalysis of the market for the subproject\u2019s output and an assessment of market \ndemands.  The  proposed  subproject  must  be  technically  feasible,  the  least-cost \nsolution, and economically cost-effective. \n(iii)  The subproject will be sustainable. Financial sustainability is demonstrated if the \nfinancial internal rate of return is equal to or higher than the weighted average cost \nof capital for those subprojects where usages are charged to users, where relevant. \nIf this criterion is not met for a subproject, then arrangements will be made for that \nsubproject to ensure that O&M costs of the subproject are financed and that the \nsubproject  operates  over  its  expected  life.  Institutional  sustainability  may  be \ndemonstrated by assessing the IA\u2019s organization, staffing, and skill sets for the \nsubproject and providing capacity building under the Project. \n(iv)  The  proposed  subproject  is  environmentally  sound  as  determined  through  an \nenvironmental  examination  carried  out  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of AJKG, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy 2002 and the agreed-upon EARPF. \n(v)  The  proposed  subproject  will  have  had  a  social  impact  assessment,  and  an \nassessment of possible land acquisition and resettlement issues as set out in the \nresettlement framework and procedural guidelines (RFPG, Supplementary Appendix \nB, and summarized in Appendix 11). If there is any land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement,  a  resettlement  plan  will  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with \napplicable laws and regulations of AJKG, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995), and RFPG (Appendix 11). \n(vi)  The equipment, materials, and other resources required can be acquired in, or \ntransported to, the subproject location without unreasonable obstruction or delay. \n \n8.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n56.  Out of five project components, it is expected that only components C and D may require \nminor land acquisition: 1 ha in component C and 45 ha in component D. To address these minor \nimpacts and comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, the RFPG was formulated by \nAJKG. For all subprojects that may require land acquisition or resettlement, land acquisition and ", " 15\nresettlement plans (LARPs) will be prepared in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act of 1994, \nas amended, and associated regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and \nthe RFPG. These will be submitted to ADB for approval before any land acquisition takes place. \nThe RFPG will provide the framework for formulating an appropriate resettlement plan for any \nsubproject with resettlement impacts that will be approved during loan implementation. The RFPG \nand the approved LARPs will be posted on the ADB web site, and circulated to all affected towns \nand villages.  \n \n9.  Environmental Assessments and Monitoring \n57.  The Project is classified as an environmental category \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy 2002 as the primary focus is on rehabilitation of existing social infrastructure. \nThe Project has been designed and will be flexibly implemented following a sector loan modality. \nAn overview of the environmental impacts of various components, along with an IEE carried out for \ntwo sample subprojects, is summarized in Appendix 15 (details in Supplementary Appendix C). \nBased on the overview and the sample IEEs, no significantly adverse environmental impacts are \nanticipated; as such a detailed environmental impact assessment is not required. Selection and \napproval of all subprojects will be governed by criteria that, among other factors, include degree of \nimpacts on the environment. In addition, an EARPF has been developed to guide environmental \nassessment of subprojects during implementation (Appendix 10). All subprojects of all components \nwill be subject to the EARPF. The IEEs will include an EMP, detailing mitigating measures and a \nmonitoring  plan.  Compliance  with  environmental  safeguards  in  all  subprojects  will  be \nmainstreamed  by  incorporating  measures  to  mitigate  potentially  adverse  impacts  as  part  of \nsubproject  design,  construction,  and  operation.  Approval  of  subprojects  with  estimated  costs \nexceeding  $1.5  million  equivalent  will  be  subject  to  approval  of  an  IEE  by  ADB.  All  other \nsubprojects  will  be  approved  by  AJKEPA.  Following  approval  by  AJKEPA,  the  summary \nenvironmental assessment together with the two sample summary IEEs, and the EARPF will be \nposted on the ADB web site. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n58.  A performance monitoring system, satisfactory to ADB will be established, based on the key \nindicators and targets outlined in the project framework. The PCU, with the assistance of project-\nfinanced consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures and plans in accordance with \nthe  ADB's  Project  Performance  Monitoring  System  Handbook  within  9  months  of  loan \neffectiveness. The PPMS procedures, performance indicators, and their targets will be reviewed \nand approved by ADB. Benchmark surveys will be conducted before project implementation. The \nPCU, with the help of its consultant, will then undertake every 6 months quantitative and qualitative \nproject performance monitoring for each project component to evaluate the delivery of planned \nfacilities and the project benefits that accrued. The PIUs will assist the PCU in collecting baseline \ndata and carrying out PPMS activities.  \n \n11.  Project Review \n59.  The Project will be reviewed jointly by the PCU, each IA, and ADB every 4 months to \nassess progress and at midterm more comprehensively. Taking into account the performance \nmonitoring results from the PPMS, the midterm review (MTR) will (i) evaluate the project scope, \ndesign, and implementation arrangements; (ii) evaluate the progress of institutional reform, and \ninfrastructure development components; (iii) identify changes needed in any or all of the above \nareas;  (iv)  assess  implementation  performance  against  agreed-upon  targets  in  the  project \nframework; (v) identify critical issues and constraints, if any; and (vi) recommend adjustments to \nthe project design and/or implementation arrangements, if necessary. The MTR will identify any ", "16  \nslow-moving component and recommend remedial measures. The MTR Mission may recommend \nreallocation of funds from poorly performing components to better performing ones. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n60.  Estimates7 from a socioeconomic survey show that about 46% of the households in AJK \nlive below the poverty line.8 The unemployment rate is about 37.5% and the larger part of the \nunemployed are domestic workers, mostly women. Low-income rural and urban communities live \nin underserved settlements with poor infrastructure facilities and services.  The areas that have \nfaced the most security issues experience poverty levels estimated to range from 70% to 90%, \nwhich are much higher than in the rest of the areas in AJK. The field surveys during the Loan Fact-\nFinding Mission demonstrated that the majority of the existing physical and social infrastructure \nwas either damaged or has long passed its useful life. Until this infrastructure is restored, it will not \nbe possible for communities in the areas to restore their living conditions, even at a very basic \nlevel, and begin the long process of catching up with the development that has been available to \nthe rest of the country for the past more than five decades. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is provided in Appendix 9. \n \n61.  The Project will (i) improve living conditions, the quality of life, and economic prospects in \nAJK by rehabilitating and reconstructing essential physical and social infrastructure that had been \ndamaged by decades of neglect; (ii) ensure a rapid improvement in the well-being of about 3.4 \nmillion people in AJK, mainly low-income communities; (iii) improve AJK\u2019s human capital base and \ncontribute to attainment of the MDGs in AJK by the quality of and access to social services; and \nalso boost economic growth by rehabilitating roads and power network. \n \n62.  Improved roads will provide both urban and rural communities with access to better health \nand  education  services.  Travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs  will  be  reduced,  and  the \nreductions will in turn result in greater availability of transport services, lower agricultural input \ncosts, and higher agricultural output prices. Improved road networks will create better access to \nmarkets, employment, and services. Establishment of basic facilities on the roadside, such as \nwaiting  areas  (benches  and  shade)  and  basic  toilet  facilities,  will keep  passengers  safe  and \ncomfortable. Construction work will give the poor seasonal income-earning opportunities. \n \n63.  Electricity growth has a direct bearing on gross domestic product growth. The beneficiaries \nof power rehabilitation are industry, fishery, agriculture, livestock production, housing, education, \nhealth, water supply, and irrigation. Electricity will benefit the whole population and improve living \nstandards. Improved water supply and quality of water will help reduce waterborne diseases. \nSavings on medical expenses in poor households can be used for family well-being. Improved \nquality of and access to drinking water for poor communities in the project area will reduce the time \nthat women spend fetching in water. An awareness campaign for increased use of piped water will \nbe conducted in areas where people depend on unsafe spring water for drinking. Improved hospital \nand health services will have a large impact on the health condition of the population in the project \narea. Improved pediatric, obstetric, and gynecological services will improve the health conditions of \nchildren and their mothers. Improved hospital care in the tehsil hospitals will give the poor access \nto better health services. Improved health will increase the productivity of the poor. \n \n64.  The  Project  will  maximize  impacts  on  women  through  various  project  components.  In \ncomponent A, gynecological, obstetric, and pediatric units in district and tehsil hospitals will be \n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 9 May 2002. Project Appraisal Document, AJK CISP. Washington, DC. \n8  The poverty line is estimated to be Rs2,500\u20133,000 per month per household. ", " 17\nexpanded and provided with essential equipment, additional delivery tables in the labor room, and \nadequate  number  of  women  gynecologists.  The  changes  will  upgrade  maternity  facilities  to \nenhance  services  to  vulnerable  women  and  reduce  maternal  and  infant  mortality  rates.  In \ncomponent B, SMCs will be mobilized to increase the enrollment of girls in primary and middle \nschools. Separate toilets will be built for girls and female teachers. In component C, women \norganizations in the project area will be involved in implementing at the grassroots level the \ncommunity awareness program for use of pipe water. In component D, roadside waiting areas for \npassengers will be built with separate bench for women and children. Separate toilets for women \nwill  be  built  near  the  waiting  areas.  The  M&E  system  of  each  PIU  will  develop  a  gender-\ndisaggregated database to monitor project impact on women. Communities and particularly women \nwill be involved in the process of preparing and implementing the subprojects, with intensive \nconsultations through consultants and NGOs.  \n \n65.  The Project will use methodologies conducive to community participation, local capacity \nbuilding,  provision  of  employment,  and  provision  of  venues  for  those  wishing  to  share  their \nexperiences. This approach will support the local community's sense of ownership. \n \n66.  Economic and Financial Assessment. Considering the urgent need for rehabilitating \nessential social and physical infrastructure to provide relief to 3.4 million people, the economic \njustification of the Project has been based primarily on the economic theory of evaluating public \nchoices through direct evidence.9 For this purpose, a socioeconomic survey along with random \nopinion polls was undertaken to find out perceived public preferences and identify what people \nconsider the most important and the least important components. The data obtained concluded \nthat safe water supply was the top priority followed by health, education, electricity, and roads, \nrespectively. Accordingly, the sectors\u2019 shares in the total loan correlate with the identified priorities.  \nDetails are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n67.  For  components  C  and  E,  the  current  average  economic  costs  were  computed  and \ncompared with the average economic cost for the proposed investment. The analysis concluded \nthat the investments were justified as the current average costs exceeded the average cost of the \nproposed investments. \n \n68.  An overview of the present financial position of various line departments in AJKG indicates \nsome resource gap in the case of nonrevenue departments such as health and education.  This \ngap is normally plugged with income from the AJK Council, share of the federal tax, an income in \nlieu of aid from the federal Government for deficit budget and net capital receipts/cash resources. \nThe contribution is in line with the government\u2019s policy for reducing poverty and providing better \nhealth and education facilities to relatively underdeveloped regions of the country. For lack of \ninformation, it was not possible to complete a financial evaluation of the components; instead, the \ncost  implication  of  the  Project  for  the  financial  position  of  the  Government  and  AJKG  was \nassessed.  The  assessment  shows  that  the  project  financing  requirements  and  incremental \nrecurrent  costs  can  reasonably  be  accommodated  with  the  existing  resources  of  both  the  \nGovernment and AJKG. The Project addresses the issues of sectoral and institutional sustainability \nby  developing  the  professional  capacity  of  IAs  in  planning,  design,  construction,  and \ncommissioning; strengthening sector governance; and instituting various programs and measures \nto improve the IAs\u2019 operating efficiency and financial performance. All IAs, except AJKED, have \nbeen implementing externally funded projects and maintaining adequate internal controls. To this \nend, particular attention will be given to training for the accounting staff of all IAs, particularly \nAJKED, including in-service training, developing a comprehensive MIS, and improving accounting \nand audit procedures to ensure adequate internal controls. \n \n                                                 \n9  The standard of economic analysis is consistent with that of emergency loans and is an exception for this loan.  ", "18  \nB.  Risks \n69.  Major risks associated with the Project include the following: \n(i)  the security situation may worsen and delay project implementation; \n(ii)  given  that  this  is  ADB\u2019s  first  operation  in  AJK,  the  Project  faces  some \nimplementation risk, and the capacity of IAs may not be sufficiently improved to \nsuccessfully implement the Project; and \n(iii)  IAs may not successfully address minor land acquisition and resettlement issues in \naccordance with the resettlement framework. \n \n70.  The  return  of  tension  is  considered  unlikely  in  the  near  future.  With  regard  to  the \nimplementation  risk  and  capacity  of  IAs,  the  Project  will  engage  design  and  implementation \nconsultants,  and  NGOs  to  support  the  IAs  and  their  respective  PIUs.  Several  IAs  do  have \nexperience with internationally funded projects. For all subprojects requiring land acquisition or \nresettlement,  LARPs  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  any  land \nacquisition or displacement takes place. \n \nV.

", "  Appendix 3  25 \n \nCOMPONENT A:  REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES \nA.  Rationale and Concept     \n \n1.  Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has a reasonable network of primary health care \nservices besides adequate support for referral hospitals. For a population of about 3.4 million, \nthere are 7 district hospitals, 6 tehsil (subdistrict) hospitals, 31 rural health centers, 184 basic \nhealth units, and 105 dispensaries. For all health facilities, there are 1,572 beds, with bed-to-\npopulation ratio of 1:2,195, doctor-to-population ratio of 1:6,035 and nurse-to-population ratio of \n1:15,207. Health services are free for all in AJK and financed by the state, with the private \nsector  providing  for  only  12.5%  of  the  population.  About  7.5%  of  the  total  government \nexpenditure is spent on health (PRs720 million), out of which 80% is recurring expenditure and \n20% development expenditure. The annual per capita government expenditure on health is $4, \nwhich is much below international averages of $12 and $75 for developing and developed \ncountries, respectively. \n \n2.  District and subdistrict facilities in AJK are equipped to provide a range of primary health \ncare services in the absence of well-functioning community-level services. These base hospitals \nprovide treatment for basic conditions such as fever, cough, cold, and diarrhea as well as \nvaccination services; emergency treatment of injured persons, burn victims; and comprehensive \nemergency obstetric care. They provide all these services to every individual residing in this \nterritory  where  87%  of  the  population  is  rural.  Each  of  those  hospitals  has  considerable \ncoverage of rural and poor communities spread over the mountainous terrain of AJK. For this \nreason, the government of AJK plans to strengthen first these base hospitals then the basic \nhealth units.  \n \n3.  None of the district hospitals have a proper accident and emergency department to \nefficiently deal with emergencies. Important departments like pediatrics, cardiac and operation \ntheaters lack essential equipment. Accommodations for doctors, paramedics, and nurses are \nlimited in most hospitals. The situation in tesil hospitals is even worse, particularly in Athmuqam, \nBurnala, Fatehpur, and Kahuta where many hospitals have been partly or completely damaged. \nThe tesil hospital at Athmuqam, which is completely damaged, has been nonfunctional for \nseveral years. Due to lack of access to proper health services, every year a large number of \npeople die in these areas. The most vulnerable groups like women and children have been \nbadly affected. The major problems and weaknesses of tesil headquarters (THQ) hospitals \ninclude limited indoor facilities; absent or nonfunctioning operation theaters, lack of diagnostic \nservices like an X-ray machine and laboratory facilities, absence of proper buildings for an \noutpatient department and administrative staff; shortage of doctors, nurses, and paramedics \ndue to lack of accommodations and no incentive package to work in remote and war-torn areas. \n \n4.  On the average, 75,000 patients are admitted in district hospitals every year, 32,000 of \nthem for some form of emergency. Every year about 4,000 people die in emergencies and a \ngreater number suffer from some kind of disability due to the limited capacity of accident and \nemergency departments. Furthermore, out of the annually reported 500 seriously burned cases, \nmore than 50% die for lack of life-saving equipment. Many lives can be saved and disabilities \nprevented,  if  the  accident  and  emergency  departments  are  rehabilitated,  emergency \ntransportation system is improved with adequate ambulances, adequate number of doctors and \nparamedical staff are recruited and trained, and essential life-saving equipment is available and \nfunctioning.  For  this  purpose,  AJKG  has  prioritized  for  urgent  external  financing  the \nrehabilitation of accident and emergency departments, and replacement of some outdated and \nunserviceable equipment in all district headquarter (DHQ) hospitals, and rehabilitation of four ", "26  Appendix 3 \nseriously damaged tesil hospitals. To attract doctors to work in remote THQ hospitals, AJKG \nrecently decided to provide an incentive package of PRs25,000 per month and also lift the \nrestrictions for non-AJK doctors to work in these areas. Added with the accommodation facilities \nto  be  provided  under  the  Project,  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  expects  to  depute  an \nadequate number of doctors in THQ hospitals.  \n \n5.  About 60% of the recurring budget (PRs560 million) is spent mainly on staff salaries and \nthe remainder for operational costs. The annual operational budget for district hospitals ranges \nbetween PRs19 million and PRs45 million; for tesil hospitals, the average budget is PRs3 \nmillion. Of that amount, 40% is used mainly for essential supplies, medicine, utilities, fuel, diet, \nand  repairs,  and  is  generally  inadequate  to  meet  actual  requirements,  hence  the  chronic \nshortage of medicine and nonfunctioning of equipment. There is no clear policy for equitable \nand rational distribution and availability of medicine. As such, the hospitals are unable to provide \nfree medicine, as per AJKG\u2019s policy. A district hospital generates on average PRs0.8 million \nfrom medical fees (PRs2.0 per visit), which is deposited in the government exchequer. There \nare  no  other  sources  of  revenue  for  hospitals  except  for  informal  private  donations  and \ncontribution from the government\u2019s charity fund from which PRs10 million per year is provided.  \n \n6.  Management is generally centralized, and the medical superintendent and his deputy \nappointed by the government are responsible for day-to-day management, procurement, and \naccounting of funds, in line with the government\u2019s policy and approved budget. The accounts \nare annually audited by the auditor general's office. Private contributions and charity funds are \nmanaged  by  the  group  of  syndicates  comprising  members  from  the  professional  doctors \ncommunity, civil society, and the private sector. \n \n7.  Considering the above problems, a two-pronged approach is needed to simultaneously \naddress the issues of (i) providing the most essential equipment and infrastructure that will \ndirectly benefit the poor communities and can immediately bring development impacts, and (ii) \nAJKG to take certain key actions (para. 12) to ensure the sustainability of services. \n \nB.  Scope \n \n8.  This component will include (i) extension and rehabilitation of accident and emergency \ndepartments of eight DHQ1 hospitals including civil works and provision of needed medical \nequipment; (ii) rehabilitation of THQ hospitals at Athmuqam, Burnala, Fathehpur, and Kahuta \nthrough repair and renovation of existing buildings and rehabilitation/reconstruction of a 30-bed \nward  with  an  operation  theater  and  other  necessary  services;  construction  of  hostels  for \nnurses/other staff and accommodations for doctors; and provision of diagnostic facilities like X-\nray machine, laboratory and electrocardiogram machine; (iii) provision of essential equipment to \npediatric and gynecology departments at the DHQ and THQ hospitals, focusing on upgrading \nmaternity facilities for enhanced services to vulnerable women and reducing maternal and infant \nmortality rates; (iv) construction of proper waiting areas and provision of public toilets and clean \ndrinking water for visitors at the above DHQ and THQ hospitals; (v) consultancy assistance for \nthe design and construction supervision of civil works and procurement of equipment, and for \nenhancing the technical capacity of doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff through training; and \n(vi) funding of recurrent expenditure of the project implementation unit (PIU) and the salaries of \nPIU staff and the required additional doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff. Under item (vi) the \nProject will finance the salaries on a declining basis: 100% in year 1, 75% in year 2, 50% and \n                                                 \n1  Comprising seven DHQs hospitals and the Abbas Institute in Muzaffarabad District.

Under this component, the capacity of doctors, nurses and paramedics, and DOH staff \nwill be enhanced through training, focusing on management of trauma and emergency critical \ncare. The training will include training for health Managers, district and tesil medical officers, \nspecialists, nurses, and paramedical staff in such areas as handling emergencies, working in \noperating rooms, intensive therapy unit, and coronary care unit. For this purpose, the quality of \nall existing in-service training centers in AJK will be improved through provision of teaching aids \nand equipment, and training of trainers.

Objective and Scope \n \n1.  This component will rehabilitate facilities and provide other support required immediately \nto  restore  and  improve  education  services,  including  (i)  rehabilitation/reconstruction  of  30 \ndamaged primary schools and 7 damaged middle school buildings; (ii) repair and improvement \nof about 56 middle schools and 56 high schools as per agreed-upon criteria; (iii) provision of \nwater and sanitation facilities to all schools where such facilities are inadequate; (iv) consultancy \nassistance to the education department to build capacity by training the teaching staff including \nin-service training of follow-up learning material, developing a comprehensive management \ninformation  system  (MIS),  improving  management  and  planning  capacity  of  the  education \ndepartment, and design and construction of civil works; (v) strengthening of school management \ncommittees (SMCs) through community mobilization and training; and (vi) funding of recurrent \nexpenditure of the PIU and salaries of the PIU staff. Under item (vi), the Project will finance the \nsalaries of PIU staff on a declining basis: 100% during year 1, 75% in year 2, 50% in year 3, and \n25% in year 4.  \n2.  As a matter of priority, all schools in the project area will be provided latrines and \nconnections for safe drinking water. Health and hygiene education will be promoted. The Project \nwill monitor the effects of improvements in water quality on health, especially on child stunting, \nby organizing a representative sample study and project performance management system \n(PPMS). \n \nB.  Selection Criteria \n3.  The selection criteria applied to qualify primary and middle schools for construction of \nbuildings are minimum enrollment and maximum teacher-student ratio; reasonable proximity to \nother schools; voluntary contribution of land and willingness of local communities to participate \nin and contribute to building, maintaining, and managing the schools. The key principle is to \nprovide infrastructure as an incentive for encouraging enrollment and improving student-teacher \nratio, but at the same time ensuring community ownership, and sustainability and viability of \nfacilities  provided.  In  addition  to  the  general  selection  criteria  for  subproject  selection,  the \nfollowing criteria will be applied for construction of buildings for primary schools: \n \n(i)  the enrollment is at least 25 students and the maximum teacher-to-student ratio \nis 1:40;  \n(ii)  the selected school is not currently included in any other project for the same  \nactivities; \n(iii)  distance between the selected schools is at least 1.5 kilometers (km); and \n(iv)  based  on  the  enrollment,  single-teacher  primary  schools  will  be  provided  a \nstandard two-room building; and primary schools, with two teachers or more, will \nbe provided a standard three-room building. \n \n4.  For middle schools, repair and improvement will be provided to schools that meet the \nfollowing criteria  \n(i)  the enrollment is at least 100 students and the minimum number of trained \nteachers is 8. In case of enrollment above 200, a maximum teacher-to-student \nratio is 1:25;  \n(ii)  the  land  required  to  accommodate  additional  facilities  is  already  in  the \npossession of the respective school authorities;  ", "30  Appendix 4 \n(iii)  the selected school is not currently included in any other project for the same \nactivities; and \n(iv)  there are at least four feeder schools within a 2-km radius of the middle school. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n5.  The Department of Education (DOE) of AJKG will be the implementing agency (IA) for \nthis component. A PIU headed by a project implementation officer and with adequate staff will \nbe established by DOE to manage activities including procurement of civil works, coordination \nwith other relevant departments and line agencies, progress monitoring, audit of accounts and \nfinancial statements, and preparation of progress reports. Procurement of civil works, goods, \nand services will be in accordance with the procedures agreed-upon in the loan agreement and \nin the light of the guidelines of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). All civil works contracts will \nbe prepared by DOE based on standard layouts that will be validated and reviewed by the \ndesign consultants. Similarly, specifications for school furniture and laboratory equipment will be \nprepared using DOE standards, reviewed by the consultants, and approved by ADB.   \n \n6.  Construction of buildings for primary schools may be undertaken by the respective \nSMC/CO of each village. The SMCs will be registered organizations and will sign a fomal \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  DOE  to  undertake  their  obligations.  Each  SMC \n(independent or as part of CO) will comprise a chairman selected by the community, with \nschoolteachers, and at least three parents of the students as members. SMCs/COs will be \nformed, mobilized, and trained under the Project through community mobilizers/non-government \norganizations. \n \nD.  Consulting Services \n \n7.  About 71 person-months of consulting services will be required to help DOE implement \nthe  education  component.  Consulting  services  will  provide  (i)  project  management  and \nimplementation  support  to  DOE  for  planning,  identification  of  target  schools,  detailed \nengineering  design,  bid  preparation,  and  construction  supervision  for  the  rehabilitation, \nreconstruction,  and  improvements  of  selected  primary,  middle  and  high  schools;  and  (ii) \nassistance  in  procuring  equipment;  overall  project  and  education  planning,  policy  review, \nmanagement (including MIS), monitoring and reporting, and coordinating the capacity building \nprogram for teachers. \n \n8.  DOE  will  also  require  the  services  of  an  NGO/consulting  firm  for  formation  (where \nrequired),  and  mobilization  and  capacity  building  for  SMCs.  The  services  will  cover  (i) \nmobilization of SMCs for participation in and contribution to primary school construction; (ii) \nidentifying  training  needs  of  SMCs  for  effective  school  management;  and  (iii)  building  the \ncapacity  of  SMCs  in  identified  needs  including  bookkeeping,  and  education  management \npractices and related qualitative measures (monitoring, etc.); (iv) guidance to SMCs in procuring \nmaterial for school construction, mobilizing savings for O&M of schools, and registration or \nintegration of SMC with existing registered COs. Outline terms of references for the consulting \nservices and NGO services are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nE.  Special Consideration \n \n9.  The current design standards in constructing primary and middle schools require about \n2.3 cubic meters of wood for a single-room school. To curtail environmental damage and \nunnecessary use of wood, the standards will be revised to eliminate or minimize the use of \nwood, except where necessary, such as in remote inaccessible areas. ", "  Appendix 4  31 \n \n \n10.  Teachers\u2019 training introducing modern teaching techniques and basic subjects will be \nconducted by the existing Education Extension Department (EED) based on already developed \nmodules and training material, and will be a one-time activity conducted at the local level. The \nProject will also provide an incentive package, which will be agreed-upon with ADB during \ninception, providing quality-based bonus to primary teachers recommended by SMC on the \nbasis of their performance and application of training received from EED.  \n \nF.  Risks \n \n11.  The  success  of  the  Project  depends  on  (i)  strict  compliance  with  the  agreed-upon \nselection criteria, (ii) capacity of DOE to successfully implement the Project, (iii) availability of \nthe  minimum  number  of  required  teachers  in  schools,  and  (iv)  sustained  provision  of  the \nrequired O&M funds. With regard to the first two risks, the Project will engage design and \nimplementation  consultants,  NGO,  and  SMCs  to  support  DOE  and  its  PIU.  ADB  will \nindependently monitor selected samples using an advisory technical assistance and through \nreview missions and consultants\u2019 reports.  On the last two risks a high-level understanding was \nreached with AJKG and safeguards were built into the project covenants, supported by policy \nreviews as part of project implementation. \n \nG.  Covenants and Assurances \n \n12.  AJKG  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  the  legal \ndocuments:  \n \n(i)  All positions required to meet the staffing requirement of trained teacher-student \nratio of 1:40 and 1:25 at primary and middle levels, respectively, will be filled \nthrough redeployment and/or by creating these posts in the recurring budget \nbefore the start of any subproject.  \n(ii)  No new land will be acquired. All land required for construction of additional \nfacilities is already available and is in the possession of AJKG or have been \nvoluntarily donated by community. \n(iii)  The recurring and operational budget for all middle schools will be provided at \nrationalized incentive- and performance-based criteria mutually agreed-upon with \nADB  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  The  recurring  budget  for  O&M  will  be \nprogressively increased to 15% of the overall recurring budget, starting from 1 \nJuly 2005 at an annual rate of 3% per year. ", "32  Appendix 5 \nCOMPONENT C: REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF  \nWATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS \n \nA.  Rationale  \n1.  Limited piped water is available in all major towns in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). In \nmany urban schemes, the existing water networks and water treatment plants are dilapidated \nand water quality does not meet the prescribed World Health Organization standards. A recent \nsurvey of the hospitals carried out during the Mission indicates that typhoid, hepatitis, cholera, \nand other gastrointestinal water-related diseases have reached an alarming level and hospitals \nare continuously registering an increase in patients. The government of AJK (AJKG) continues \nto spend funds from its annual development program (ADP) to improve water supply services, \nbut those funds are inadequate to completely address the issues. Despite the adequate and \nabundant water throughout the year in streams and river tributaries, AJK has consistently \nlagged behind in efficient utilization of these natural resources. The residents of unserved \nsettlements have to rely often on unsafe sources such as rivers, open wells, and natural \nstreams. Contamination of water sources, intermittent supply, intermixing of sewerage and \nwater pipelines due to inadequate spacing and faulty joints and old leaking pipes are major \nissues that require urgent attention. Service levels in the sanitation sector are also low. Only a \npoor form of a proper sewerage system is present in a few urban setups, except Muzaffarabad. \nDrainage systems in towns depend on open canals that serve as both drainage and sewage \ncollection points. Wastewater is disposed of without any proper treatment and causes water \nquality of rivers and streams to deteriorate. Surveillance and control of water quality are a major \nissue. The Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) laboratory stationed at Muzaffarabad \nhas been in operation since 1997 and is properly equipped for analysis of major drinking water \nparameters except a few. However, the present staff lacks capacity and proper skills to produce \nreliable results. Immediate attention is required to improve water supply, water quality, and \nsanitation systems in a planned and systematic manner. \n \n2.  An overview of the existing water supply situation in each district is in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope  \n \n3.  This component will improve living conditions and the quality of life in urban communities \nwhere  water  is  scarce  and  unsafe  for  human  consumption.  Component  C  will  include  (i) \nrehabilitation and extension of the existing water supply networks and treatment plants in all \nseven district headquarter (DHQ) towns and four selected tehsil headquarter (THQ) towns; and \n(ii) consultancy assistance to build the capacity of the PHED by providing technical and financial \nmanagement  training  for  organizing  and  efficiently  managing  water  supply  functions  in  a \nsustained and cost-effective manner, as well as for design and construction supervision of civil \nand mechanical works; and (iii) funding of recurrent expenditure of the PIU and salaries of the \nPIU staff and the required additional staff of the IA. Under item (iii), the Project will finance the \nsalaries of staff on a declining basis: 100% during year 1, 75% in year 2, 50% in year 3, and \n25% in year 4.  AJKG plans to undertake sanitation works through its ADP.  \n \n4.  Planned interventions for institutional strengthening include (i) training in technical and \nfinancial management for PHED staff, including mapping and asset management; (ii) increasing \npublic awareness of urban issues, water quality, sustainability of facilities, and options for \nimproving the delivery of urban services; (iii) improving municipal financial management by \nintroducing improved accounting procedures and management information systems that include ", "  Appendix 5  33 \n \nbudgeting,  resource  mobilization,  enhanced  O&M  of  assets,  and  improved  billing,  revenue \ncollection, and reporting systems; (iv) undertake a detailed study of tariff setting and demand \nanalysis,1 and (v) establishing regulatory systems to ensure that laws, standards, rules, and \nregulations are equitably and consistently applied. These are critical to long-term sustainability \nof urban centers. Where possible, technical training will be hands-on and linked to measurable \noutputs, to enable determination of whether required skill levels have been achieved, and to \nverify that the training is actually used on the job. The design and implementation of measures \nfor  institutional  strengthening  will  be  coordinated  with  training  programs  provided  in  other \nongoing programs. This component will set up a separate assets management section, which \nwill maintain, update, and record all assets. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Execution \n \n5.  The Planning and Development Department of AJKG will take overall responsibility for \nproject management and execution through a project coordination unit (PCU). The Public Works \nDepartment (PWD) will implement this component by establishing a PIU within its Public Health \nEngineering (PHE) Section. The PIU, headed by the project director, supported by a team of \nprofessionals from PHE and a team of consultants, will be responsible for overall coordination, \nplanning, implementation, and management of project activities.  \n \n  2.  Consulting Services \n \n6.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  to  assist  PWD/PHE  in  implementation.  The \nconsulting services will involve (i) detailed investigations for the scope of rehabilitation of the \nexisting system; (ii) review/preparation of the water supply master plans;  (iii) engineering \ndesign of the infrastructure (water distribution and treatment plant) to be rehabilitated, bid \npreparation, assistance in procurement and construction supervision/contract administration for \ncivil works and procurement of equipments; (iv) project management, monitoring, and reporting; \n(iv) establishment of asset management and water quality monitoring programs; (v) capacity \nbuilding for PWD/PHE and training for district and subdistrict staff for efficient O&M, water \nquality monitoring and rectification, and sound financial management. An estimated 152 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services will be required. The detailed outline terms of reference \nfor consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n                                                 \n1  This will be done along the lines described in a technical note given at the ADB web site. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/ERD/Technical_Notes/tn010.pdf \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \nCOMPONENT D:  REHABILITATION OF ROADS AND BRIDGES \n \nA.  Background and Rationale \n1.  Roads are the only means of transportation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and are \ncrucial not only for economic development but also for providing access to health, education, \nand  other  social  services  for  the  rural  population  scattered  over  remote  and  mountainous \nterrain.  The  average  investment  on  roads  accounts  for  over  22%  of  the  public  sector \ndevelopment  program  (PSDP)  of  the  government  of  AJK  (AJKG)  during  FY1990/91  to \nFY2002/03, and is about 29% of the PSDP for FY2003/04. \n \n2.  The total road network in AJK consists of about 9,430 kilometers (km), of which 4,021 \nkm are paved primary roads that provide links to Pakistan and connect the seven districts. The \nprimary roads are managed by the Public Works Department (PWD), which is also responsible \nfor 419 km of fair-weather1 roads that provide links to the rural areas. Another 4,990 km of roads \nare the tertiary links connecting villages to the existing road network. They are developed and \nmanaged  by  the  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  Department  (LGRDD)  in \npartnership with the community-based organizations of the villages. The mountainous terrain \nand river valleys in AJK require a significantly large number of bridges to provide the desired \nlevel of connectivity to the rural areas where about 87% of the AJK population live.  \n \n3.  Damage in insecure areas and lack of overall maintenance management resulted in \nsevere deterioration of the road network. The situation is exacerbated by poor construction \nquality2 and extreme climate conditions resulting in a large backlog of road rehabilitation and \nreconstruction.  \n \n4.  Poor maintenance of roads is less of a funding issue and more of an institutional issue. \nFunds  received  by  PWD  during  FY1991/92  to  FY2002/03  ranged  from  PRs86  million  in \nFY1991/92 to PRs160 million in FY2001/02. For FY2003/04, PWD has received PRs196 million. \nBased on the network extension and condition of a few roads, it has been estimated that the \nmaintenance  requirements  for  the  primary  network  will  range  between  PRs150  million  to \nPRs250  million.  Hence  the  allocation  of  PRs196  million  made  by  AJKG  for  FY2003/04  is \nconsidered adequate. However, the bulk of maintenance is undertaken through force-account \nprocedure that is not effective, as over half of the maintenance resources are consumed by the \nlarge number of maintenance personnel whose efficiency levels are extremely low. In addition, \nlack of data on the road network including periodic condition surveys prevents planned and \nprioritized maintenance and effective use of the resources.   \n \n5.  Major institutional reforms are needed in parallel with road network improvements to \nensure that PWD evolves into an efficient road agency that can (i) effectively manage its \nnetwork; (ii) institute cost recovery mechanisms to supplement maintenance resources, (iii) \nincorporate environmental, social, and safety aspects in developing the network; and (iv) seek \npublic-private partnership to support road development and maintenance.      \n \n6.  Realizing the need for improved construction quality and timely completion of civil works \ncontracts  for  roads,  PWD  has  initiated  procurement  reforms  that,  among  others,  include \nimproved bid evaluation procedures and screening out of poor performing contractors. These \n                                                 \n1  These are unpaved roads, not fully operational during extreme weather conditions. \n2  PWD follows the outdated 1971 Punjab Standard Specifications. However, visit to ongoing road rehabilitation \ncontracts indicates that even these standards are not fully complied.   ", "  Appendix 6  35 \n \nare just the first steps, and continuation and introduction of further reforms are needed to \nachieve the objective of cost-effective, good quality, and timely construction works.   \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope  \n \n7.  The objectives of the road component are to (i) contribute to economic development \nthrough  improved  road  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  provide  rural  populations  in  AJK  access  to \nlivelihood and social services, thereby reducing poverty. Improvement of primary roads will \nreduce transportation costs, enhance subregional connectivity, facilitate trade, and promote \nregional peace and harmony.     \n \n8.  Accordingly, the road component will cover rehabilitation and improvement of roads \nproviding inter- and intra-district links and improving subregional connectivity, construction of \nmajor bridges, suspension bridges for jeeps, and suspension footbridges to provide access to \nremote areas. Physical improvements will be supplemented by institutional improvements in \nPWD. \n \n9.  This component will comprise (i) rehabilitation and improvement of a minimum of 130 \nkilometers (km) of the primary road network; (ii) construction/replacement of a minimum of 650 \nmeters  (m)  of  major  bridges  on  the  primary  roads;  (iii)  construction  of  about  1,050  m  of \nsuspension bridges for jeeps on secondary/tertiary roads; (iv) construction of about 1,050 m of \nsuspension  footbridges  to  improve  connectivity  of  remote  communities;  (v)  policy  reforms, \ncapacity building for PWD, and improvements in civil works procurement procedures; and (vi) \nfunding of recurrent expenditure of the PIU and salaries of the PIU staff. Under item (vi), the \nProject will finance the salaries of PIU staff on a declining basis: 100% during year 1, 75% in \nyear 2, 50% in year 3, and 25% in year 4.  \n \n10.  Capacity building for PWD and LGRDD will include (i) institutionalizing a road asset \nmanagement  system,  (ii)  training  in  technical  aspects,  project  management,  and  contract \nadministration; and (iii) introduction of geographic information system. Policy reform initiatives \ninclude (i) introducing of cost recovery through user charge or tolls; (ii) creating a dedicated road \nmaintenance fund financed from the Government\u2019s annual maintenance allocations and toll \nrevenues;  (iii)  including  environmental,  social,  and  resettlement  impacts  in  planning;  (iv) \nproviding road safety in road design and inclusion of road safety audits for each road; (v) \ngradually deleting force account procedures and introducing maintenance through contracts; \nand (iv) introducing projects financed through public-private partnership. The Project will support \n(i) introduction of improved prequalification procedures; (ii) a provision in contracts to enable \ncontractors to procure equipment; (iii) capacity building for contractors\u2019 staff in specifications, \nquality  control,  bids  preparation,  etc.;  and  (iv)  introduction  of  an  incentive  program  for \nperforming contractors.   \n \n11.  PWD has identified a number of priority road sections for rehabilitation/widening, and \npriority bridges for construction under the Project. The prioritized list of roads and bridges \nproposed by PWD and LGRDD is in Supplementary Appendix H. As the proposed roads exceed \nthe financing available under the project, selection criteria (para. 16) are prepared based on the \nproject objectives, field visits to most of the roads and bridges in the list, and discussions with \nPWD on the ongoing road improvement program. The selection criteria include network needs, \ntechnical and economic feasibility, and resettlement, social and environmental impacts. The \nProject will finance up to approximately 180 km of roads and 800 m of bridges from the list that ", "36  Appendix 6 \nmeet  the  selection  criteria.  The  design  standards  and  typical  cross-section  for  road \nimprovements are in Supplementary Appendix H.3      \n \n12.  LGRDD also provided a long list of suspension bridges for jeeps and footbridges for \nconsideration under the Project. With the available financing, about 15 suspension bridges \ntotaling 1,050 m, and about 15 footbridges also totaling 1,050 m will be included. These bridges \nwill be selected from the list prepared by LGRDD in consultation with the project implementation \nunit (PIU) and approved by the project steering committee. \n \nC.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  PWD will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for this component. For suspension bridges \nand footbridges, LGRDD will be the IA. Each PIU at PWD and LGRDD, headed by  a project \nimplementation officer and with adequate staff will be established to oversee implementation. \nThe PIU will be responsible for overall management of activities including procurement of civil \nworks, coordination with other relevant departments and line agencies, progress monitoring, \naudit of accounts and financial statements, and preparation of progress reports. The PIU at \nLGRDD  will be responsible for implementing suspension bridges for jeeps and footbridges.  \n \nD.   Consulting Services \n \n14.  Domestic consulting services of about 364 person-months will be required to assist PWD \nand LGRDD in implementing the road component. They will involve (i) feasibility studies and \nassessment  of  eligibility  of  the  proposed  roads  and  bridges;  (ii)  detailed  engineering,  bid \npreparation, assistance in procurement and construction supervision/contract administration for \nprimary  roads,  major  bridges,  suspension  bridges  for  jeeps  and  footbridges;  (iii)  project \nmanagement,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  (iv)  establishment  of  road  asset  management;  (v) \ncapacity building of PWD and LGRDD and contractors; and (vi) assistance to PWD and LGRDD \nin policy and institutional reforms and procurement reforms. The consultants will also assist \nPWD in monitoring and verifying compliance of resettlement actions and environment mitigation \nmeasures. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix A.    \n \nE.  Road Maintenance \n \n15.  PWD is responsible for maintaining the road network and bridges.  Presently the road \nmaintenance work is carried out under force account procedure by the large number of staff on \nPWD\u2019s payroll (para. 4). This is not an efficient system as over half of the annual maintenance \nfunds are consumed in salaries and inadequate resources are left for actual maintenance \nactivities.  This  issue  is  being  addressed  under  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms \nsubcomponent. To ensure sustainability of the roads improved under the Project, the civil work \ncontracts, wherever possible, will provide for maintenance of roads for an initial period of 5 \nyears. The cost of maintenance will be funded from counterpart resources. Subsequently a \nmore capable PWD would take over the responsibility for road maintenance.  \n \nF.  Selection Criteria for Roads and Bridges \n \n16.  In addition to the general subproject selection criteria noted in the main text of the \nReport and Recommendation of the President, the selection of the roads and bridges to be \n                                                 \n3  The initial prioritized list had 21 candidate roads and 12 bridges, but was reduced to 15 short-listed roads and 9 \nbridges based on field visits and evaluation. ", "  Appendix 6  37 \n \nfinanced under the Project will be subject to Asian Development Bank (ADB) approval, based \non the following criteria:  \n \n(i)  Network  requirement.  The  proposed  road  or  bridge  will  be  part  of \nPWD\u2019s/LGRDD\u2019s primary road network and AJKG\u2019s priority list (Supplementary \nAppendix G). To meet connectivity needs and focus on the rural areas, urban \nroads will not be included. \n(ii)  Technical feasibility. The proposed road or bridge will be technically feasible \nbased surveys and detailed engineering to be undertaken during implementation. \n(iii)  Economic feasibility. The proposed road or bridge will be economically viable in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Project, and the \nestimated economic internal rate of return will not be less than 12%. The PIU will \ninclude a transport economist (as part of proposed package B of consultants) to \nundertake respective analysis. \n(iv)  Resettlement  and  social  impact.  The  proposed  road  or  bridge  should  not \nrequire any involuntary resettlement or major land acquisition, follow existing \nalignment, and avoid major impacts on any affected persons. If land acquisition \nor involuntary resettlement cannot be avoided, a full resettlement plan (for more \nthan  200  affected  persons)  or  short  resettlement  plan  (for  fewer  than  200 \naffected  persons),  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Resettlement \nFramework and Procedural Guidelines as agreed-upon by AJKG and ADB and in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Involuntary Resettlement. \n(v)  Environmental considerations. The proposed road or bridge will not cause any \nmajor  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  and  include  only \nrehabilitation/upgrading of existing roads. The roads will follow existing alignment \n(rights-of-way) and do not require cutting of a large number of trees or clearing of \nforest, and provide adequate drainage. An initial environmental examination will \nbe  required  to  determine  its  environmental  impacts  in  compliance  with  the \nrequirements of the Government and ADB and the environmental assessment \nreview procedures framework.4 \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003.

Rationale and Concept \n1.  The  power  sector  in  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK)  consists  of  the  Electricity \nDepartment (AJKED), the Hydroelectric Board (HEB), and the Inspectorate of Electricity. AJKED \nis  responsible  for  planning,  construction,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  power \ndistribution network in AJK. HEB is in charge of electricity generation from hydropower stations in \nAJK up to the capacity of 50 megawatts (MW), and the Inspectorate of Electricity assumes the \nrole of sector regulator. Of the current electricity supply requirement of 307 MW in AJK, 270 MW \nis supplied by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) of Pakistan through the \nAJK national grid system comprising nine grid stations of 132 kilovolts (kV) and six grid stations of \n33 kV, while HEB supplies about 37 MW. WAPDA is also responsible for construction, O&M of all \ntransmission systems in AJK and plans to expand the capacity to 400 MW for the next 5 years. In \nremote areas, electricity is also supplied from off-grid systems, but the quantity is negligible. The \nInspectorate of Electricity regulates the quality and tariff of electricity supply in AJK, voluntarily \nfollowing the rules and regulations as well as the tariff settings established by the National \nElectricity Power Regulatory Authority of Pakistan. This institutional structure is expected to \nremain unchanged in the foreseeable future.  \n \n2.  Prior to 1973, electricity supply was available only in a few towns with a network of 295 \nkilometers (km) of 11 kV lines, 176 km of 0.4 kV lines, and 75 transformers/substations. Since \nAJKED  launched  a  broad  electrification  program  in  1974  with  implementation  of  the  Power \nDevelopment Scheme in AJK, the electricity supply system has been substantially expanded. The \ncurrent power distribution network comprises 6,450 km of 11 kV lines, 10,040 km of 0.4 kV lines, \nand 7,000 transformers/substations, connecting electricity to about 70% of the population and \n95% of the villages. However, inadequate O&M for the network due to insufficient investment has \nlead  to  poor  quality  of  service  characterized by  high  system  losses,  frequent  outages,  and \nsignificant voltage drops. Inadequate power supply has been a major constraint to economic and \nsocial development in AJK where 87% of the population reside in rural areas with an average \nannual income of about $200-$250, half of the average income in Pakistan. The provision of \nreliable and adequate electricity supply is essential to boost the local economy, and this is a \ncentral feature of the government of AJK (AJKG) priorities and development plans. In line with \nthis, the development focus of AJKED is primarily on expansion of electricity supply to the \nremaining areas and improvement of efficiency in electricity supply. AJKED has prepared and \nimplemented various programs to expand electricity supply to the remaining populations.  \n \n3.  To improve the efficiency of electricity supply, it is essential to reduce system losses. \nAlthough losses have been reduced from 47% over the last 7 years, the current overall loss in the \nlevel of 37%,1 is unacceptably high and not sustainable. High system losses are attributable to (i) \ninsufficient  grid  stations;  (ii)  lengthy  and  overloaded  feeders/lines;  (iii)  damaged/overloaded \ntransformers;  (iv)  slow,  damaged/obsolete  meters;  (v)  poor  maintenance  facilities;  and  (vi) \ninadequate  billing  systems.  To  address  the  items  (ii),  (iii),  (iv)  and  (v),  AJKED  engaged  a \nconsultant  in  1995  to  assess  the  state  of  various  feeders  and  come  up  with  a  plan  for \nrehabilitation and augmentation of the distribution network. Survey and mapping of the existing \ndistribution network have almost been completed, and completion of the engineering and detailed \ndesign  is  expected  by  December  2004.  From  this  study,  AJKED  has  prepared  a  plan\u2014\n                                                 \n1  From data provided by AJKED, technical losses are estimated to range from 20% to 22%, while administrative losses \nare 15-17%.   ", "  Appendix 7  39 \n \nImprovement, Renovation, and Augmentation of Power Distribution Network in AJK for which \nfinancial assistance is being sought from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  To address item \n(i),  WAPDA  has  embarked  on  an  augmentation  and  expansion  plan  of  grid  stations  in \nconsultation  with  AJKED.  To  address  item  (vi),  AJKED  has  initiated  the  development  of  a \ncomputerized billing system utilizing its own funds, initially for the area of Muzzafarrabad, the \ncapital city of AJK. If successful, the system will be replicated in the rest of AJK.  \n \n4.  Investments for construction and O&M of the power distribution network have been made \nby AJKED with the development budget of AJKG without assistance from external aid agencies. \nHowever, AJKED has limited experience in implementing of large projects and has had no \nexperience working with other aid agencies. In view of this, the Project will assist AJKED in \ndeveloping  its  professional  capacity  by  providing  consulting  services  in  planning,  design, \nconstruction, commissioning, and testing of power distribution systems.  \n \n5.  Due to the relatively low tariff levels in AJK, affordability and willingness to pay are \nsatisfactory as may be seen in the high billing/collection ratio of 91.4% in FY2003. Addressing the \nkey issue of high system losses under the Project will improve the financial situation of AJKED, \nwith the possibility of more room for reduction of tariff levels in a longer term. \n \n6.  The Project is not listed in the Country Strategy and Program/Updates for Pakistan. \nHowever,  the  project  fits  in  ADB\u2019s  overall  strategy  to  reduce  poverty,  promote  subregional \ncooperation  among  member  countries,  and  help  reinforce  the  current  positive  environment \ngenerated  through  the  Islamabad  Declaration.  These  operations  give  ADB  an  excellent \nopportunity to use its investments in physical and social infrastructure to help reduce poverty in \nthe areas and catalyze the normalization of relations between the two major countries in the \nregion. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n7.  The  Project  aims  to  help  AJKED  implement  the  urgently  needed  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement of the power distribution network in AJK to reduce system losses and improve \nreliability of the existing power distribution network through (i) rehabilitation and augmentation of \nabout 750 km of 11 kilovolt (kV) lines; (ii) rehabilitation and augmentation of about 900 km of 0.4 \nkV lines; (iii) replacement and addition of 11 kV/0.4 kV transformers; (iv) rehabilitation and \naugmentation of service connections; (v) procurement of necessary equipment and tools for \nadequate O&M of the power distribution network; (vi) consulting services for implementing this \ncomponent and capacity building of AJKED; and (vii) funding of recurrent expenditure of the PIU \nand salaries of the PIU staff and required additional staff of the IA. Under item (vii), the Project \nwill finance the salaries of staff on a declining basis: 100% during year 1, 75% in year 2, 50% in \nyear 3, and 25% in year 4. \n \n8.  To strengthen sector efficiency, the Project will help AJKED develop its professional \ncapacity by providing consulting services in planning, design, construction, commissioning, and \ntesting of power distribution systems. In addition, assistance will be provided for strengthening \nsector governance, enhancing AJKED\u2019s financial performance, and instituting various programs \nand measures to improve AJKED\u2019s operating efficiency and performance. To this end, particular \nattention will be given to (i) improving financial performance and self-financing of AJKED by \nreduction  of  system  losses,  (ii)  helping  to introduce  a  computerized billing  system,  and  (iii) \nimproving accounting and audit procedures.  \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Execution \n \n9.  The  Planning  and  Development  Department  of  AJKG  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nexecution of the Project through a project coordination unit (PCU). Implementation will be carried \nout by AJKED through a project implementation unit, headed by a full-time project implementation \nofficer,  with  a  team  of  professional  and  support  staff.    Preparation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring  of  schemes  will  be  the  responsibility  of  AJKED  and  the  PCU.  Given  the  size, \ncomplexity, and the fast-track nature of the Project, AJKED\u2019s implementation capacity needs to \nbe strengthened with consultancy assistance and installation contractors.   \n \n  2.  Selection and Implementation of Schemes \n \n10.  The scope of this component has been based on the assessment of existing distribution \nlines undertaken by the consultants of AJKED in three of the seven districts. However, AJKED \nwill  identify,  prioritize,  and  design  the  schemes  to  be  covered  under  the  Project  with  the \nassistance of the implementation consultants during project implementation. The schemes to be \ncovered will follow the general subproject selection criteria stated in the main text of the Report \nand Recommendation of the President: technically feasible, the least-cost option, and considering \nthe increase in demand in the future. AJKED will prepare proposals for these schemes in a format \nagreed-upon with ADB during the project inception period.  \n \nD.  Risks \n \n11.  The success of the Project will depend on (i) expansion and augmentation of the grid \nstation capacity to be undertaken by WAPDA; (ii) AJKED\u2019s capacity to successfully implement the \nProject; and (iii) timely release of counterpart funds by AJKG. To address the first risk, there has \nbeen  a  high-level  agreement  among  AJKG,  WAPDA,  and  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  To \nmitigate the second risk, the Project will finance implementation consultants and installation \ncontractors to be engaged by AJKED. As the last risk, covenants were proposed to ensure the \navailability of counterpart funds.   \n \nE.  Covenant and Assurances \n12.  In  addition  to  the  standard  covenants,  the  proposed  loan  covenants  will  include  the \nfollowing:   \n \n(i)  AJKG will cause AJKED to employ competent and qualified contractors for timely \nand proper installation of equipment and materials procured. \n \n(ii)  AJKG  will  ensure  that  the  power  distribution  systems  rehabilitated  under  the \nProject are operated and maintained properly, and that adequate budgetary and \nother resources including human resources will be provided for that purpose. \n \n(iii)  AJKG and AJKED will ensure that all schemes meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nthe agreed-upon selection criteria and implementation arrangements.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector  identified  as  a  National  Priority  in  Country identified as a National Priority in Country Poverty \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  Yes  Partnership Agreement?  Yes \nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nOf the total Azad Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s (AJK) population of 3.4 million, 87% live in the rural areas. The \naverage annual income of the rural population is about $200-$250, half of the average income in Pakistan. \nEconomic development in AJK started in early 1970s. However, due to  security problems and the low level \nof investment in social and physical infrastructure, AJK has lagged behind in development. Furthermore, \ninfrastructure damage has displaced several thousand people and deprived communities of basic services, \nproductive assets, and social capital. It has caused loss of people's income and property, and sometimes \ndeath, physical injury, psychological stress, and war-related trauma. Lack of funds for operation and \nmaintenance  and  inefficiency  of  public  institutions  have  affected  public  service  delivery  and  physical \ninfrastructure in rural and urban areas.     \n \nRehabilitation and extension of essential infrastructure, particularly health, education, water supply, road \nnetwork, and power and electricity supply, are critical for the revival and improvement of economic activities. \nRehabilitation  can  contribute  to  employment  creation,  income  generation,  rehabilitation  of  displaced \npopulations, improvement of security and stability, and result in rapid improvement of living conditions and \nthe quality of life of about 3.4 million people in AJK\u2019s mainly low-income communities. Improved roads will \nprovide both urban and rural communities with access to better health and education services, reduce travel \ntime  and  transportation  cost,  and  therefore  better  access  to  markets,  employment,  and  services. \nEstablishment of basic facilities on the roadside such as waiting areas (benches and shade) and basic toilet \nfacilities will make passengers safe and comfortable. A regular electric supply will increase economic \ndevelopment in the area. Improved water supply and quality will decrease water-borne diseases. The \nsavings on medical expenses of poor households can be used for the family well-being. Improvement in the \nquality of and access to drinking water in poor communities in the project area will reduce the time spent by \nwomen in fetching water. An awareness campaign for increased use of pipe water will be undertaken in the \nareas where people depend on unsafe spring water for drinking. Improved hospital and health services will \nhave a great impact on the health condition of the population. Improving pediatric and gynecology services \nwill improve health conditions of children and their mothers. Improved health of the poor will increase their \nproductivity. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Targeted Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nIn early 2001, the Government of Pakistan and AJK initiated a participatory poverty assessment as part of \nthe  effort  to  develop  more  effective  poverty  reduction  policies.  The  study  found  that  poverty  is \nmultidimensional and is influenced by both economic and social factors. The findings indicate that poverty \nconsists of lack of resources (financial and physical assets); lack of access to education, health, and basic \nservices; lack of access to forest; lack of respect; and discrimination. Poverty is not distributed evenly in the \nsociety and the well-being of the population depends on gender, age, tribe/caste, family structure, and local \nconditions. According to the study about two thirds of the people in the communities are very poor or poor. \nSome characteristics of poverty follow: limited access to  secure income and employment; little or no land \nand livestock; limited access to natural resources; poor quality of houses; dependence on credit; household \noften in debt; lack of access to basic services (health, education, water); households often with many \nchildren; households with no voice in the community and no role in decision making. \n \nAnother  socioeconomic  survey  (Project  Appraisal  document,  AJK  Community  Infrastructure  Services \nproject, World Bank, 9 May 2002) estimates that about 46% of the households in AJK live below the poverty \nline.  The  poverty  line  is  estimated  to  be  PRs2,500\u2013PRs3,000  per  month  per  household.  Reduced ", "  Appendix 9  43 \n \nagricultural productivity and rapid increase in population have overburdened subsistence agriculture and \ncaused an increase in out-migration for off-farm employment. A significant percentage of the working force \nof AJK are employed in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Pakistan. The unemployment rate is \nabout 37.5% and the large part of the unemployed population are domestic workers, mostly women. \nAverage per capita monthly income is in the range of PRs5,000 \u2013 PRs6,000.  \n \nLow-income rural and urban communities live in underserved settlements with poor infrastructure facilities \nand services. The northern part of Neelum valley and those near the Jehlum River in Bagh district and \nSudhnoti are the poorest with limited economic and development opportunities. Most of these areas lack \naccess to roads and people have to travel long distances on foot and pay heavy charges to transport goods. \nPoor roads make it difficult for anyone suffering from a serious ailment or a woman in labor to reach the \nnearest hospital alive. Water sources are located more than an average 1 kilometer (km) from a household.  \nIn many places where pipe water is available, water is directly supplied from the river without proper \ntreatment and thus is unfit to drink. For drinking water, households rely primarily on natural spring water and, \nin some places in the Southern districts, on dug wells. Focus group interviews with communities and health \nofficials indicate that households suffer mainly from waterborne diseases, which increase family health care \nexpenditures. Access to and quality of health services are poor throughout AJK and most families during the \ninterviews expressed dissatisfaction with the available inadequate health care. While the government has \ninvested significantly in providing access to primary education to all, the quality of infrastructure and \neducation is poor. A large majority of the children are attending dangerous/damaged primary schools. \nPhysical  accommodation,  equipment,  and  staff  in  higher  education  are  inadequate  and  poor.  Poor \nhouseholds suffer more than the others in access to quality water, education, and health services. \n \nThe Project is multisectoral. It focuses on health, education, water, roads, and electricity and the activities \nare  designed  to  increase  access  to  these  basic  services  for  the  poor.  The  improvement  of  school \nmanagement committees (SMC) and involvement of poor parents in SMC will give them a voice in the local \ndecision-making process. Improving primary schools and availability of teachers for these schools will \nprovide poor children with quality education. Improving hospitals will provide increased access for the semi-\nurban  and  rural  population.  Improving  the  water  supply  system  with  better  quality  water  will  reduce \nwaterborne  diseases.  Engaging  local  labor  in  construction  work  for  the  Project  will  increase  wage \nemployment opportunities for a large number of poor households. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis                                                                                                                          Yes \n \nField visits were made to both rural and urban areas, hospitals, water treatment plant, etc. Rapid social \nassessment was conducted in 14 villages. Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with key \ninformants such as teachers, doctors, health workers, community leaders, women, students, and non-\ngovernment organizations (NGOs) to assess the social and economic conditions of the communities, gender \nrelations,  access  to  water,  education,  roads,  electricity,  community  involvement  in  implementing \ndevelopment programs, etc. During field visits showed that community participation in planning development \nprojects was minimal. There are a few NGOs working in AJK. In recent years they have formed community-\nbased  organizations  (CBOs)  for  implementing  health,  water,  and  education  projects.  Community \norganizations and village banks have been formed through a microcredit program of the International Fund \nfor Agriculture Development (IFAD). The efforts of the NGOs and aid organizations have created a process \nfor involving local communities, especially the poor, in local-level development activities. \n \nThe Project will be implemented through stakeholder consultation using successful experience in already \ncompleted  and  ongoing  projects.  Community  consultation  will  be  carried  out  to  determine  priority  in \nsubproject selection. Methodologies conducive to community participation, local capacity building, and the \nprovision of employment will be introduced. Depending on the technical requirements, opportunities for local \ncommunities to work in project implementation will be incorporated. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \nD.  Gender and Development  \nIn AJK, the sex ratio, i.e., males per 100 females is about 101. About 20% of the rural households are \nheaded  by  women  and  generally  all  community  and  social  organizations  are  headed  by  men.  The \nexceptions are the CBOs formed by NGOs/aid agencies. Almost 40% CBOs under IFAD project are female \nCBOs. Government projects generally do not consult women. At the family level, key decisions about \nfarming and other productive matters rest largely with the male heads.  However, women are consulted in \ndecisions regarding social and other household affairs. The physical mobility of rural women in AJK is more \nthan that in Pakistan. Rural women are not secluded in AJK, largely because of a significant improvement in \nliteracy rates among them and the absence of feudalism. Unemployment is about 37.5% and a large part of \nthe unemployed population are domestic workers, mostly women. Women in AJK are actively involved in \nincome-generating activities at the household level from both on-farm and off-farm sources. There is also a \ngrowing trend among young girls who have completed high school to go for computer and other technical \ncourses so as to get jobs in offices in the urban centers.  \n \nAccording to a recent baseline study, the literacy rate is about 56% among females and about 80% among \nmales. Only about 10% females and about 18% males complete high school, whereas only 4% women and \n13% men are able to go beyond high school.  The absence of middle and high school facilities for girls in \nmost areas restricts girls\u2019 access to secondary education.  Girls from poor households drop out from primary \nschool as early as on completion of grade 2 because of domestic work, parents\u2019 inability to pay for or lack of \ninterest in girls\u2019 education. The World Food Programme\u2019s oil distribution program in girls\u2019 primary schools is \nan effort to improve girls\u2019 enrollment and attendance in 251 selected schools in Muzaffarabad and Bagh. \nMost girls\u2019 schools in the AJK operate with a small number of teaching staff. This is especially true at high \nschool level where science subjects cannot be taught because of the unavailability of local science teachers, \ndepriving girls of the chance to study science subjects. Further, it is increasingly difficult to get female \nteachers to work in remote areas because of long hours of travel on poor roads. Women have the primary \nresponsibility for water collection in households and family health care. Women from rural areas have limited \naccess to health care. Women with serious medical complications in the area have to be referred to nearby \ndistrict hospitals. The Project will pursue the following strategies to maximize impact on women:  \nEducation. Women CBOs and SMCs will be mobilized to increase the enrollment of girls in primary and \nmiddle schools. Separate toilets will be built for girls and female teachers.  \nWater. At the grassroots level, women CBOs in the project area will be involved in implementing the \ncommunity awareness program for use of pipe water.  \nHealth. Gynecological and pediatric units in district and tehsil (subdistrict) hospitals will be expanded and \nprovided with essential equipment, additional delivery tables in the labor room, and adequate number of lady \ngynecologists.  \nRoads. The roadside waiting area for passengers will be built. A separate bench for women and children will \nbe placed in the waiting area. A separate toilet for women will be built near the waiting area.  \nPIU. In the project coordination unit (PCU), an official from the women cell of the Planning and Development \nDepartment (P&D) will be included. The female officer from the P&D will coordinate with the project \nimplementation units (PIUs) to ensure that the gender strategy is implemented. A social development and \ngender specialist will be recruited to develop a gender action plan based on the gender strategy, and \ncoordinate with the social marketing consultant for involving female CBOs in designing the awareness \ncampaign. The female officer from P&D in the PCU will coordinate the work of the consultants. In each PIU, \none government person will act as gender focal point for the respective sectors.  The monitoring and \nevaluation system of each PIU will develop a gender-disaggregated database to monitor project impact on \nwomen. \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \n \nE.

Introduction \n1.  The proposed Project is in environmental category B. It has been designed and will be \nflexibly implemented following a sector approach. Selection of subprojects will be governed by \ncriteria, among which is the requirement that no subproject will have significant adverse impacts \non  the  environment.  The  Project  comprises  rehabilitation  of  social  infrastructure,  that  is, \nrehabilitation and improvement of existing roads and bridges, water supply systems in major \nurban centers, education facilities, health facilities, and power distribution systems. \n \n2.  An overall initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken to assess generic \nimpacts of each subcomponent (Supplementary Appendix C). In addition to the overall IEE, \nsubproject-specific IEEs have been prepared for two sample subprojects (Muzzafarabad Water \nSupply System and for Khaigalla-Hjaira road) to serve as model in preparing IEEs during \nimplementation. This environmental assessment and review procedures framework (EARPF) \nwas prepared to guide the environmental assessment of subprojects for each subcomponent \nand facilitate compliance with environmental requirements of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  (including  the Environment  Policy  2002),  and  the  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK) \nEnvironmental Protection Act 2000, during implementation. \n \nB.  Overview of Type of Subprojects to Be Assessed \n3.  The  proposed  Project  comprises  the  following  components:    (i)  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement of health services, (ii) rehabilitation and improvement of education services, (iii) \nrehabilitation and improvement of the power distribution network, (iv) improvement of water \nsupply systems, and (v) rehabilitation of roads and rehabilitation/replacement of bridges. All \nsubprojects of all these components will be subject to environmental assessment and review \nprocedures. The health component, which includes provision of equipment and rehabilitation of \nexisting  facilities/reconstruction  of  some  buildings,  will  not  have  any  significantly  adverse \nimpacts on the environment. Very minor impacts resulting from reconstruction activities can \neasily be mitigated. Similarly, the education component that includes rehabilitation of existing \nbuildings, construction of small primary school buildings, and provision of facilities will also have \nno significantly adverse environmental impacts. Rehabilitation of power distribution systems that \nincludes replacing certain power lines, transmission poles, and transformers will result in only \ntemporary disruptions and no adverse impacts on the environment. In fact, by rehabilitating the \npower transmission systems, transmission leakages will be reduced, and more electricity will be \navailable to consumers. As a consequence, reduced dependence on fossil fuels, wood energy, \nand other environmentally unsafe materials, will result in a positive impact on the environment. \n \n4.  Rehabilitation and/or replacement of bridges will have minimal adverse impact on the \nenvironment. The design of road rehabilitation and improvement will ensure minimal impact on \nthe hilly landscape and immediate mitigation of minor impacts. Rehabilitation and improvement \nof water supply schemes will have positive environmental impacts due to appropriate water \ntreatment that will ensure a supply of clean water to consumers, ascertained through regular \nmonitoring of water quality. The component will also ensure adequate protection and security of \nwater sources, treatments plants, pumps, and other systems; and will prevent any chances of \ncontamination in the distribution system by keeping water distribution mains separate from \nsewerage systems and away from areas where potentially health-risk generating solid waste \naccumulates.  Capacity  building  for  concerned  institutions  and  awareness  enhancement ", "  Appendix 10  47 \n \nmeasures for the target communities will enhance accountability, ensure distribution of safe \ndrinking water, and prevent potential health hazards. \n \nC.  Country\u2019s Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n5.  The AJK Environmental Protection Act requires environmental assessments for all public \nand  private  sector  development  projects,  depending  on  the  category  of  environmental \nadversities.  AJK  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (AJKEPA),  which  issues  environmental \nclearance, ratifies the executing agency reports. Compliance with the environmental aspects of \ndevelopment interventions in AJK is primarily governed by the AJK Environmental Protection \nAct was adopted from the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997. Associated legislation \nthat will be relevant to managing environmental compliance includes (i) Fisheries Regulation \n1902; (ii) Jammu & Kashmir Forest Regulation No. 2 of 1930, and Forest (Sale of Timber) Act, \n1930; (iii) Azad Kashmir Logging and Sawmill Corporation Act, 1985; (iv) Ordinance XICX of \n1980, providing for the law relating forest protection and distribution of timber through local \nbodies; and (v) Azad Jammu and Kashmir Wildlife Preservation Act, 1975. The institutions \nresponsible for compliance are led by AJKEPA and assisted by the Forest Department, Police \nDepartment, Fisheries Department, and Revenue Department. AJKEPA is also responsible for \nregular monitoring of environmental safeguards during implementation. \n \nD.  Specific Procedure of Environmental Assessment of Subprojects  \n1.  Responsibilities, Authorities, and Procedure for Environmental Assessment  \n \n6.  An IEE will be carried out for each subproject in all components of the Project during \nimplementation. The IEE report and a summary IEE (SIEE) report for each proposed subproject \nwill be prepared as part of a feasibility study report and conducted by experts working with \nconcerned line agencies through their project implementation units (PIUs) under the overall \nguidance of the Executing Agency (Planning and Development Department [P&D] of AJK) \nthrough its project coordination unit (PCU), and AJKEPA. For each of subproject, the IEE/SIEE \nwill include an environmental management plan (EMP) with specific mitigation measures and \nfinancial sources as pre-requisite for approval, and a monitoring and enforcement program will \nbe developed to ensure that none of the components result in any significantly adverse impacts.  \n \n7.  Public consultation will be conducted through interviews, meetings, or surveys as part of \nenvironmental assessment for each subproject-based on the public involvement procedures and \nguidelines established by AJKEPA, and the results will be documented and reflected in IEEs.   \n \n8.  The IEEs for all subprojects will follow the format of ADB\u2019s guidelines in preparing IEEs \nand this EARPF. For all subprojects exceeding a total cost of $1.5 million, the IEEs will be \nsubmitted to AJKEPA for review and then to ADB for review and approval 6 weeks before \nimplementation. All other IEEs will be approved by AJKEPA prior to implementation. The Social \nSectors  Division  of  ADB,  in  consultation  with  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, will be responsible for review and approval of IEEs submitted to ADB. \n \n9.  To mitigate any potential adverse impacts, identified environmental measures will be \nincorporated  into  the  subproject  design.  AJKEPA  and  its  subordinate  offices  will  monitor \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  as  detailed  in  the  EMPs  for  various  components.    In \naddition, P&D through its PCU will be provided additional expertise for regular environmental \nmonitoring and reporting during implementation. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \n10.  Since  the  environmental  assessment  report  is  subject  to  public  disclosure,  all  IEE \nreports of subprojects will be kept in the project files and made available to the public on \ndemand. P&D and the implementing agencies will be responsible for monitoring implementation \nof the IEE reports including the EMP. ADB will undertake implementation monitoring as part of \nits administrative responsibilities under the Project. \n \n2.  Environmental Criteria of Subproject Selection \n \n11.  Environment-specific criteria included in the criteria for selecting subprojects state: (i) the \nproposed  subproject  is  environmentally  sound  as  determined  through  an  environmental \nexamination carried out in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of the Government, \nADB guidelines, and this EARPF; and (ii) the subprojects or components or subcomponents of \nsubprojects involving rehabilitation of social infrastructure such as roads and water supply \nschemes, will be undertaken within the existing rights-of-way, and any losses associated with \nland acquisition or resettlement will adequately be compensated.   \n \nE.  Staffing Requirements and Budget \n12.  A qualified domestic environmental consultant will be recruited for 36 person-months by \nthe PCU during project implementation to (i) prepare the IEE/SIEEs, (ii) ensure compliance with \nthe mitigating measures proposed in the IEEs and EMPs for all components or subprojects \nfunded by the Project, and (iii) provide necessary training. Supplementary Appendix A gives the \nterms of reference. \n \n13.  To facilitate regular monitoring of compliance with environmental quality standards in \ncase of water supply systems, road rehabilitation and other construction activities, and the \nrecommendations in the EMPs of the respective subproject IEEs, AJKEPA will be strengthened \nin terms of equipment, facilities, and consulting services. The Public Works Department as well \nas its Public Health Engineering Circle (Environmental Management Unit) will be strengthened \nthrough facilities, equipment, and consulting services to enhance its capacity for environmental \nmonitoring  and  mainstreaming  environmental  management,  especially  for  water  supply \nsystems, roads rehabilitation, and other construction activities. \n \n14.  Since environmental management will be an integral part of project design, construction, \nand operational activities, each subproject includes cost estimates for environmental mitigation \nand monitoring as part of the EMP. Specific details on the cost of environmental mitigation \nmeasures will be available as detailed feasibility study reports are prepared for each subproject \nduring implementation. \n \n15.  AJKEPA, which is primarily responsible for environmental monitoring, is headed by a \ndirector. The position is being upgraded to the level of director general. The agency has a \nlaboratory  at  Muzzafarabad,  which  is  in  dire  need  of  capacity  building.  Due  to  capacity \nconstraints, AJKEPA is not able to meet all its monitoring requirements and hence needs \nsignificant input of resources to bring it to a point where it can adequately deliver its mandate.  \nAJKEPA also has the responsibility for strengthening the capacities of line agencies to carry out \nenvironmental management and monitoring. ", "  Appendix 11  49 \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  For  the  Project\u2019s  five  components,  minor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be \nrequired in the case of the water supply systems and the roads and bridges components. To \nensure land acquisition in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy,  a  resettlement  framework  (RF)  and  procedural  guidelines  have  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  1998  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  and  signed  by  the \ngovernment  of  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJKG).  The  RF  will  guide  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment  Department  (P&D)  as  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  implementing  agencies  in \npreparing short land acquisition and resettlements plans (LARPs) when required. The RF and \nthe procedural guidelines are detailed in Supplementary Appendix B and summarized below: \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  From available information, land acquisition and resettlement impacts are considered \nminor  and  insignificant.  Rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  health  services,  of  education \nservices,  and  of  the  power  distribution  network  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement. However, land acquisition, although minimal, will be required for the roads and \nbridges component and, to a certain extent, in the water supply systems component. Minor \nresettlement will be needed for certain road sections (for widening purposes) and bridges (for \nappropriate locations). About 45 hectares (ha), mostly secondary forest along roads will be \nneeded for roads and bridgest and is estimated to cost about $350,000 equivalent. About 1 ha \nof land that will be acquired for the water supply systems component at Bhimber, Dirkot, Kotli, \nand Nakyal, is estimated to cost about $225,000 equivalent. \n \nC.  Legal Framework, Land Acquisition and Resettlement Principles, and Eligibility for \nCompensation  \n \n3.  Land  will  be  acquired  with  the  consent  of  the  owners  at  market  prices  paid  and \ncalculated based on the Land Revenue Records and ADB guidelines. The total number of \naffected persons (APs) will be determined after (i) proper demarcation of land by the concerned \nagencies, (ii) measurement of land by the land revenue department, (iii) preparation by the land \nrevenue department of the list of owners of the land to be acquired. All land acquisition will be \ncarried out under the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Land Acquisition Act 1894, as amended, and \nLand Acquisition Rules 1994. In accordance with these rules and incorporating ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement, the basic principles of land acquisition and resettlement will, among \nother things, include these provisions: (i) minimize negative impacts as much as possible; (ii) \ncarry out land acquisition/resettlement and compensation to improve or at least restore the \npreproject income and living standards of the APs; (iii) fully inform and allow close consultation \nwith APs on compensation options and the LARPs to be prepared during implementation; (iv) \nprovide assets and resettlement at replacement rates; (v) provide compensation for lost land, \nassets, and resettlement allowances in full before land requisition and structure demolition; (vi) \nrequire  disbursements  for  each  subproject  to  be  conditional  on  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the \nsubproject/component LARPs; (vii) give prior notice to the private agriculture landowner and \ntenant farmers before harvesting the crops; (viii) pay leaseholders an amount equal to the \nannual land rent if land is acquired before completion of 1 year of his contract; (ix) lack of legal \ndocuments  for  their  customary  rights  or  occupancy  certificates  will  not  affect  eligibility  for \ncompensation; (x) this RF will apply to all components under the Project and all APs whether or \nnot they are directly funded by ADB or regardless of the severity of impact; (xi) pay particular ", "50  Appendix 11 \nattention to the needs of vulnerable groups, defined as affected households that are below the \npoverty line, or have only elderly members, or single parent or ethnic nationality; and (xii) \nensure compliance of land acquisition and resettlement policy and procedures with all AJKG \nlegislation, rules, and procedures on land acquisition and ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines. \n \nD.  Entitlements \n \n4.

The proposed Project is in environmental category \u201cB\u201d in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Environment Policy 2002, as it primarily focuses on rehabilitation \nof existing social infrastructure, with none or minimal adverse impacts on the environment, \nwhich can easily be mitigated. Given a large number of interventions and widely dispersed \nnature of subprojects under components B, D, and E, the Project has been designed and will be \nflexibly implemented following a sector approach. A sector loan modality has been followed in \nenvironmental assessment. Accordingly, selection of subprojects will be governed by criteria \nthat, among other things, stipulate that there is no significant adverse impacts on environment.  \n \n2.  An  overall  environmental  assessment  was  undertaken  to  determine  generic \nenvironmental impacts of each subcomponent during May-June 2004 in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines and the government of AJK\u2019s (AJKG\u2019s) environmental \nrequirements (see Supplementary Appendix C). At the same time, subproject-specific initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared for two comparatively sensitive subprojects \n(Muzzafarabad  Water  Supply  System  and  Khaigalla-Hjaira  road)  to  serve  as  samples  for \nenvironmental assessment and models in preparing IEEs during implementation. In addition, an \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures framework (EARPF) has been developed to \nguide environmental assessment of the subprojects during implementation (Appendix 10) and to \nfacilitate  compliance  with  AJKG\u2019s  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.  All \nsubprojects of all project components will be subject to the EARPF. As indicated in the EARPF, \nIEEs for all subprojects will be prepared by the Executing Agency (EA) and approved by AJK \nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  (AJKEPA).  IEEs  for  subprojects  with  estimated  costs \nexceeding $1.5 million will be subject to approval by ADB. Following clearance by AJKG, this \nenvironmental assessment report and the EARPF will be posted on ADB\u2019s web site. \n  \nB.   Overview of the Project \n3.  The objective of the Project is to improve living conditions and the quality of life in AJK \nby  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  essential  physical  and  social  infrastructure  that  were \ndamaged by decades of neglect. The Project will provide rapid improvement in the well-being of \nabout 3.4 million people in AJK, mainly low-income communities. The Project, briefly described \nin the following sections, comprises five components: (i) rehabilitation and improvement of \nhealth services, (ii) rehabilitation and improvement of education services, (iii) rehabilitation and \nimprovement  of  water  supply  systems,  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  roads  and  bridges,  and  (v) \nrehabilitation and improvement of the power distribution network.  \n     \n4.  Rehabilitation and Improvement of Health Services. This component includes (i) \nextension  and  rehabilitation  of  accident  and  emergency  departments  of  eight  district \nheadquarters (DHQ) hospitals including civil works and equipment; (ii) provision of essential \nequipment to pediatric and gynecology departments in these hospitals; (iii) rehabilitation of tehsil \n(subdistrict)  headquarters  (THQ)  hospitals  at  Athmuqam,  Burnala,  Fathehpur,  and  Kahuta \nthrough repair and renovation of existing buildings and construction of a 30-bed ward with an \noperation  theater;  construction  of  hostels  for  nurses/other  staff  and  accommodations  for \ndoctors; and provision of diagnostic facilities like X-ray machine, laboratory facilities, and ECG \nmachine; (iv) development of proper waiting areas and provision of public toilet and clean \ndrinking water facilities for visitors at the DHQ and THQ hospitals; (v) enhancing technical ", "56  Appendix 15 \ncapacity of doctors; (vi) incremental administrative support to the project implementation unit \n(PIU); and (vii) consultancy assistance for design and construction supervision of civil works. \n   \n5.  Rehabilitation and Improvement of Education Services. This component aims to \nrehabilitate, immediately restore, and improve education services, and includes including (i) \nrehabilitation/reconstruction of 30 damaged primary schools and 7 damaged middle school \nbuildings; (ii) repair and improvement of  about 56 middle schools and 56 high schools as per \nagreed-upon criteria; (iii) provision of water and sanitation facilities to all schools where such \nfacilities  are  inadequate;  (iv)  consultancy  assistance  to  the  education  department  to  build \ncapacity by training the teaching staff including in-service training of follow-up learning material, \ndeveloping a comprehensive management information system (MIS), improving management \nand planning capacity of the education department, and design and construction of civil works; \n(v) strengthening of school management committees (SMCs) through community mobilization \nand training; and (vi) funding of recurrent expenditure of the PIU and salaries of the PIU staff. \n   \n6.  Rehabilitation and Improvement of Water Supply Systems. This component includes \n(i) rehabilitation and extension of the existing water supply network, including rehabilitating \nexisting  treatment  plants  in  all  the  seven  DHQ  and  four  selected  THQ  towns;  and  (ii) \nstrengthening and building the capacity of the Public Works Department (PWD) and its Public \nHealth  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  to  organize  and  manage  water  supply  in  a  cost-\neffective manner.  \n \n7.  Rehabilitation  of  Roads  and  Bridges.  This  component  covers  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  of  roads  providing  inter-  and  intra-district  links  and  improving  subregional \nconnectivity with Pakistan and the other side of the line of control; construction of major bridges, \nsuspension bridges for jeeps, and suspension footbridges to provide access to remote areas. It \nincludes (i) rehabilitation and improvement of a minimum of 130 kilometers (km) of the primary \nroad network, (ii) construction/replacement of a minimum of 650 meters (m) of major bridges on \nprimary roads, (iii) construction of about 1,050 m suspension bridges on secondary/tertiary \nroads to improve connectivity, (iv) construction of about 1,050 m of suspension footbridges to \nimprove connectivity of remotely located communities, and (iv) policy reforms and capacity \nbuilding.     \n \n8.  Rehabilitation and Improvement of Power Distribution Network. This component will \nhelp reduce system losses and improve the reliability of the existing power distribution network \nthrough  (i)  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  about  750  km  of  11  kilovolt  (kV)  lines,  (ii) \nrehabilitation and augmentation of about 900 km of 0.4 kV lines, (iii) replacement and addition of \n11 kV/0.4 kV transformers, and (iv) rehabilitation and augmentation of service connections. The \nProject  will  also  procure  necessary  equipment  and  tools  for  adequate  operation  and \nmaintenance of the power distribution network, and consulting services. \n \nC.   Environmental Assessment of Potential Impacts \n \n9.  The health component, which will provide equipment, and rehabilitate existing facilities, \nand reconstruct buildings, will not have any significantly adverse impacts on the environment. \nVery minor impacts resulting from reconstruction activities can easily be mitigated. Similarly, the \neducation component that will rehabilitate existing buildings, construct small primary school \nbuildings, and provide other facilities will have no significantly adverse environmental impacts. \nRehabilitation  of  power  distribution  systems  that  includes  replacing  certain  power  lines, \ntransmission poles, and transformers will result in only temporary disruptions and no adverse \nimpacts  on  the  environment.  Rehabilitating  the  power  transmission  systems  will  reduce ", "  Appendix 15  57 \n \ntransmission  leakages,  making  more  electricity  available  to  consumers.  The  reduced \ndependence on fossil fuels and wood energy will result in positive impacts on the environment.  \n \n10.  Rehabilitation and/or replacement of bridges will have no adverse environmental impact. \nRoad rehabilitation and improvement will be designed and executed to ensure minimal impact \non the hilly landscape and immediate mitigation of minor impacts that might result. The design \nentails maintaining the current alignment of the roads, constructing side drains, cross drains, \nbreast walls, and retaining walls, and various anti-erosion measures such as (i) engineering \nmeasures  such  as  check  dams,  gabions;  and  (ii)  biological  control  measures  that  include \nrevegetation of slopes using soil-binding species where such measures have not yet been \napplied. These measures will ensure road stability and facilitate road safety for both passengers \nand vehicles, with positive environmental impacts.   \n \n11.  Rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  water  supply  schemes  will  have  positive \nenvironmental impacts by applying appropriate water treatment that ensures availability of clean \nwater to consumers, ascertained through regular monitoring of water quality. The component \nwill  also  ensure  adequate  protection  and  security  of  water  treatment  facilities, pumps  and \nassociated equipment, and prevent any chances of contamination in the distribution system by \nkeeping water distribution mains separate from sewerage systems and away from areas where \npotentially  health-risk generating  solid  waste  accumulates.  Capacity  building  for  concerned \ninstitutions and awareness enhancement measures for the target communities will enhance \naccountability, ensure distribution of safe drinking water, and prevent potential health hazards. \n \nD.   Summary IEEs of Selected Sample Subprojects \n \n12.  As  stated  earlier  (para.  2),  IEE  reports  were  prepared  for  two  sample  subprojects \n(Supplementary Appendix C). The summary IEEs for the two are reproduced in this section.  \n \n1.  Muzaffarabad Water Supply Systems Subproject \n13.  Objectives and Scope of the Subproject. The proposed subproject aims to improve \nand upgrade the water supply system (WSS) of the capital city Muzaffarabad. The city has a \nhilly and undulating topography, with Neelum River serving as the main source of drainage. The \nsubproject will improve water quality by rehabilitating the water treatment facility of 4 million \ngallons per day (mgd) capacity, and increasing the quantity of available water by rehabilitating \nthe pumps currently in a dilapidated condition. The subproject will also rehabilitate the water \ndistribution network by fixing leakages in the pumps, delivery mechanisms, and supply lines. \nRehabilitation of the WSS will improve the quantity of water to meet the continuously increasing \ndemand and enhance its quality to ensure a safe supply.  \n \n14.  Subproject  Description.  Specific  interventions  under  the  subproject  include  (i) \nconstructing a 4.0 km gravity water channel for drawing raw water from the river; (ii) repairing \nand reconstructing pump houses/platforms, filters and other related infrastructure; (iii) re-laying \nand  changing  the  water  filtration  media;  (iv)  replacing  and  re-laying  damaged  mains;  (v) \nrefurnishing and re-equipping laboratories; (vi) installing perimeter fences with security lighting \narrangements; (vii) renovating electrical systems; (viii) replacing pumping equipment; and (ix) \nproviding and installating personal safety equipment. \n \n15.  Description of the Environment. Muzaffarabad is the largest district of AJK, spread \nover an area of 6,117 km2, with a population of about 833,000. The city has a population of \n120,000 with 97% of residents having access to piped water. Average literacy rate in AJK is ", "58  Appendix 15 \n60%, relatively better than the national average. Being an urban settlement, the area has no \nendangered flora or fauna.  \n \n16.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures. Environmental impacts \nare expected to be positive. Appropriate treatment and testing of water before its distribution will \nensure safe and clean drinking water for the urban consumers. Repairs and renovation of \nleaking  mains  and  distribution  system  will  enhance  water  availability,  thereby  addressing \ndeficiencies in water supply. Adverse environmental impacts such as noise, dust, physical \ninconvenience, and contamination by oils and lubricants during construction will be minor and \ntemporary and can easily be mitigated.  Water quality monitoring will be an important element of \nenvironmental management. Due to its sensitive nature, all WSS installations will be secured \nthrough proper perimeter fencing and other measures.  \n \n17.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure. Consultations were held with a large \nnumber of stakeholders including government officials, consumers\u2014city dwellers, shopkeepers, \nand hoteliers\u2014and public representatives. Field officials of related agencies also participated in \nthe consultation and sessions on the scope. Inquiries were also made on current water-related \nissues and future problems once the WSS has been rehabilitated. In general, people displayed \na positive attitude, a strong desire, and an urge to see an improved WSS in their city responding \nto the qualitative and quantitative demands of the residents.  \n \n18.  Findings and Recommendations. The IEE findings indicate that the environmental \nimpacts  of  the  subproject  are  minor  and  can  easily  be  mitigated  by  implementing  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), which is an integral part of the IEE. At the same time \nthe environmental safeguards will have to be monitored  by concerned agencies, including \nenvironmental consultants and AJKEPA. Due diligence, with mandatory coordination among \nvarious stakeholders, will ensure mitigation of any adverse impacts.  The subproject area is not \nconsidered environmentally sensitive and the measures recommended to adequately mitigate \nthe  impact  on  the  environment  with  careful  monitoring  on  a  regular  basis,  will  ensure  no \npermanent adverse impacts. The mitigation measures are deemed adequate for the minor \nimpacts identified. In view of these findings, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is not \nrequired. \n \n2.  Khaigalla-Hajira Road \n19.  Objectives and Scope of the Subproject. The proposed subproject will rehabilitate \nand improve an existing 18 km road from Khaigalla to Hajira in Poonch district. It provides an \nimportant communication link between Rawalakote DHQ and Hajira, the THQ. Rehabilitation \nwork comprises upgrading and improving to meet the growing traffic demand and enhance road \nsafety. The subproject will also respond to the demands of growing domestic tourism, owing to \nthe spectacular landscape of the district. Tourism can be a source of additional revenue in the \npockets of poverty in the state. \n \n20.  Location  of  the  Subproject.  The  road  runs  along  the  eastern,  southeastern,  and \nsouthern areas of a large bowl-shaped valley in the district, descending from Khaigalla saddle \nand reaching the valley bed at Hajira. It comprises a segment of the main Rawalakote\u2013Hajira \nroad, which is linked to Islamabad. The subproject road passes through mountainous terrain, \ndescending all the way to its end point at Hajira. \n \n21.  Subproject Description. The subproject will comprise (i) widening by about 1 meter, \nmostly  toward  the  hillside,  entailing  excavations  and  limited  blasting;  (ii)  repair  and ", "  Appendix 15  59 \n \nreconstruction of cross drainage structures; (iii) repair and reconstruction of breast, retaining \nand toe walls; (iv) construction of side drains; (v) scrapping of existing bituminous blacktopped \npavement  and  re-laying  it  on  the  entire  road;  and  (vi)  engineering  and  vegetative  slope \nstabilization measures. A limited number of shops and houses may need to relocate, but a \ngraveyard will be avoided during road widening.  \n \n22.  The subproject area displays a mixture of soils: isolated pockets of reddish brown shale, \nwith at times fissured and weathered boulders. The stones are not suitable for construction, as \nthey crumble under load. The subproject site falls at the confluence of dry subtropical zone in \nthe south toward Hajira and moist tropical zone in the north toward Rawalakote. The upper \nreaches  support  reasonably  good  forests  of  young  Pinus  wallichiana  and  its  broadleaved \nassociates. In the lower reaches, terraced rain-fed cultivation is practiced with maize as the \nmain crop. In the lower warmer areas, the vegetation changes to Pinus roxburgii. The main \nterrestrial wildlife in the area comprises rabbits, jackals, and foxes. No rare or endangered flora \nor fauna are found in the area.  \n \n23.  Description of the Environment. Poonch District has an area of 855 km2, with a \npopulation of about 400,000. The average household size is 7.6 with an urban proportion of \n13.10%, and an overall population density of 480 persons per km2. Major occupations are \nfarming and cattle raising. The road traverses a thickly populated rural panorama, where most \nhouseholds have electricity and piped water supply. A major segment of the rural population has \naccess to primary, middle, and high schools, for boys as well as for girls.  \n \n24.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures. The IEE findings indicate \nminor environmental impacts from the subproject. They may include dumping of debris and soil, \nrolling down of debris to farmlands and dwellings, damage to trees, diversions of traffic, noise \nand other forms of nuisance. These impacts can easily be mitigated by implementing mitigation \nmeasures given in the EMP. Roadside stabilization measures such as adequate drainage, \nretaining walls, and breast walls, will be an integral part of the road rehabilitation processes. All \nexcavated spoil will be safely disposed of. Damage to public utilities, like water supply pipes, \nelectricity/phone poles will be minimized. Graveyards will be avoided and the existing alignment \nwill be maintained and expansion limited to current right-of-way. To ensure compliance with \nenvironmental safeguards and mitigation measures, monitoring will be undertaken by concerned \nagencies, consultants, and AJKEPA.  \n \n25.  The subproject passes through forests, already under severe biotic pressure resulting in \naccelerated  soil  erosion.  Excavations  that  may  further  accelerate erosion  will  therefore  be \navoided by adopting engineering cum vegetative measures for slope stabilization. Damage to \ntrees will be avoided and any unavoidable removal of trees will be carried out in consultation \nwith the Forest Department.  \n \n26.  Public  Consultation  and  Information  Disclosure.  Consultation  with  stakeholders \nduring the preparation of the IEE involved government officials, roadside dwellers, villagers, \nshopkeepers,  drivers,  transport  operators,  potential  beneficiaries,  and  available  public \nrepresentatives.  Field  officials  of  related  agencies  were  also  visited  and  participated  in \nconsultation and sessions to determine scope. In general, people displayed a highly positive \nattitude toward the subproject. \n \n27.  Findings  and  Recommendations.  The  subproject  area  is  not  considered \nenvironmentally sensitive and does not pass through any ecologically or culturally sensitive \nsites. The measures recommended in the EMP will adequately mitigate any adverse impacts on ", "60  Appendix 15 \nthe  environment,  given  the  regular  monitoring.  Proposed  mitigation  measures  are  deemed \nadequate for the minor impacts identified. In view of these findings, an EIA for Khaigalla\u2013Hajira \nroad is not required.  \n \nE.   Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n \n28.  Since the Project will adopt a sector approach in the design and implementation of the \nvarious  subprojects,  subprojects  under  each  component  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of \nselection  criteria  agreed-upon  with  the  Government.  Environment-specific  criteria  included \namong the selection criteria are as follows:  \n \n(i)  The  proposed  subproject  is  environmentally  sound  as  determined  through  an \nenvironmental  examination  carried  out  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the Government, ADB guidelines, and the EARPF; and \n \n(ii)  The  subprojects  or  components  or  subcomponents  involving  rehabilitation  or  social \ninfrastructure such as roads and water supply schemes will be undertaken within the \nexisting rights-of-way, and any losses associated with land acquisition or resettlement \nwill be adequately compensated.  \n \nF.   Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures Framework \n \n29.  The EARPF was prepared to facilitate appropriate levels of environmental management, \nwhich will include among other things preparation of IEEs/summary IEEs for all the subprojects \nlikely to have adverse, though minor, environmental impacts. In addition, the EARPF identifies \n(i)  the  requirement  for  all  subprojects  of  all project components  to undergo  environmental \nassessment;  (ii)  specific  procedure  of  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  indicating \nresponsibilities  and  authorities;  (iii)  environmental  criteria  for  subproject  selection  during \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  the  staffing  requirement  and  cost  estimates  for  preparing  IEEs, \ncompliance  with  recommendations  in  the  IEEs  and  the  EMPs,  and  capacity  building  for \nconcerned agencies. More specifically, the IEEs of the two sample subprojects will serve as \nmodels  in  preparing  the  IEEs/summary  IEEs  for  the  remaining  subprojects  during \nimplementation. Detailed environmental assessment and the IEEs of the sample subprojects \nare in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041223140328+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041130145944+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R281-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \nha  \u2013  hectare \nkV  \u2013  kilovolt \nMW  \u2013  megawatt \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
