THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the additional financing of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Corridor 2 (Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan) Railway Electrification Project. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing project on 21 April 2017 for \n$80 million from its ordinary capital resources, to help modernize 145.1 kilometers (km) of railway \ntrack between Pap, Namangan, and Andijan in the Fergana Valley.1 The proposed additional \nfinancing will increase the scope of the project to complete the modernization of the railway \nnetwork in eastern Uzbekistan. It will eliminate gaps in signaling and telecommunications systems \nthat are crucial for the safe and efficient operation of trains; boost the amount of freight and \npassenger trains; reduce the risk of trains from landslides; and improve the capacity of railway \nstaff, including women, in modern train management techniques. The project will improve regional \nconnectivity along CAREC Corridor 2, and contribute to railway-driven trade. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Need to complete modernization of railways in eastern Uzbekistan. The 4,735 km \nrailway network is the backbone of Uzbekistan\u2019s economy, carrying 30%\u201340% of the country\u2019s \nfreight and 3%\u20134% of its passenger traffic.2 The railway network in eastern Uzbekistan consists \nof a loop linking major cities in the Fergana Valley (Pap, Namangan, Andijan, Margilan, and \nKokand); and a line from Pap through the mountainous Kamchik Pass to Angren and Tashkent. \nBranch lines extend into the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. Most of these lines were built in the \nSoviet era and were designed to be used by a lower number of trains that ran on steam and later \ndiesel power. ADB and other development partners have been making coordinated efforts to \nsupport the government in modernizing Uzbekistan\u2019s railway system.3 \n \n4.  Ongoing project. The ongoing project is a key part of such efforts, helping to electrify the \n145.1  km  line  between  Pap,  Namangan,  and  Andijan;  and  to  install  signaling  and \ntelecommunications systems. The ongoing project is performing well, as (i) the project is rated \non track under the project performance rating system, (ii) each safeguard covenant item is being \ncomplied  with,  (iii)  the  delivery  of  the  expected  outputs  is  rated  successful,  and  (iv)  the \nmanagement of risks is rated successful.4 As of 23 September 2020, contract awards totaled \n$79.98 million (99.9% of the loan amount) and disbursement reached $61.40 million (76.8% of \nthe loan amount). \n \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

Manila (Loan 3527-UZB). The loan was signed on 8 November 2017 and became effective on \n29 November 2017. The current closing date of the loan is 31 December 2021. \n2  Government of Uzbekistan, State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics. 2020. Cargo Transportation \nand Cargo Turnover by Type of Transport; and Transportation of Passengers and Passenger Turnover by Mode of \nTransport (accessed 19 June 2020). The freight market share of railways averages 17% in the European Union and \n25%\u201330% in North America. The passenger share of railways in the European Union with a higher population density \nis 7%. \n3  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Rail Transport [Nonurban]) (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n4  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \n5.  Remaining  challenges.  Permanent  signaling  and  telecommunications  systems  are \nmissing for the southern part of the Fergana loop (para. 3) between Angren, Pap, Kokand, and \nAndijan, as well as on certain branch lines. This greatly affects the efficiency and safety of train \noperations, and limits the number of trains. These works were partly envisaged to be completed \nunder the loan financed by the World Bank for the Angren\u2013Pap project.5 However, procurement \ndelays led to the cancellation of the amount associated with this component, and the loan was \nclosed in March 2020. This decision took place amidst a challenging procurement landscape \nfacing Uzbekistan in 2017 and 2018, where all international financial institutions (IFIs) faced \ndelays across all sectors. ADB and O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari (UTY), the vertically integrated \npublic railway company, exercised patience and worked steadily with the government to formulate \nnew  procedures  that  are  fully  compatible  with  IFI  rules  and  regulations.  Since  then,  the \nimplementation of ADB-financed projects has accelerated.  \n \n6.  Envisaged benefits. The additional financing will expand the scope of the ongoing project \nto complete the modernization of the railway network in eastern Uzbekistan. Trains will be able to \ntravel safely and more frequently, resulting in a capacity increase of 53% for freight and 39% for \npassengers, without the need for costly works such as double-tracking. The project will reduce \nthe journey times and cost of travel for the population in the Fergana Valley. It will improve the \naccess of women and children to safer transport, with gender-inclusive facilities in trains and at \nmodernized stations (already in place). It will enhance people\u2019s access to health, education, and \nwork opportunities, most of which are in the cities of Andijan and Kokand. \n \n7.  Consistency with national development objectives. The project remains fully in line \nwith Uzbekistan\u2019s national development objectives. Transport infrastructure is recognized as a \nkey growth driver in Uzbekistan\u2019s Development Strategy, 2017\u20132021\u2014to promote economic \ndevelopment and liberalization, and support the development of the social sectors.6 The strategy \nspecifically mentions the importance of improving transport services, raising passenger safety, \nand reducing harmful emissions. \n \n8.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The additional financing further boosts the \nproject\u2019s contribution to ADB\u2019s operational priorities of (i) tackling climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and ensuring environmental sustainability; (ii) strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity; (iii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iv) fostering regional \ncooperation and integration.7 The expansion of a modernized railway network will cut greenhouse \ngases and reduce local air pollution. The improved efficiency of train services will reduce journey \ntime, improve service quality and reliability on Uzbekistan\u2019s transport network, and strengthen the \nconditions for the private sector to grow. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20122023, which calls for investments in the transport sector and the \nmodernization of railway infrastructure.8 \n \n9.  Contribution to regional connectivity. The project railway is part of CAREC Corridor 2 \nand designated rail corridors 202 and 203, which serve the vital east\u2013west trade corridor linking \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, through Central Asia, to Europe. Regional benefits envisaged \ninclude reduced time and increased efficiency of cross-border transport, improved access for \nbusinesses in the Fergana Valley to markets in neighboring countries and vice versa, and \n \n5 World Bank.

The project will enhance the transit role of Uzbekistan, facilitating the trade in \nagricultural goods produced from the Fergana Valley. The project thereby contributes to the goal \nof the CAREC Railway Strategy 2030 to make railways a mode of choice for trade\u2014quick, \nefficient, accessible to customers, and easy to use throughout the region.9 \n \n10.  Supporting ongoing reforms. UTY remains a financially robust organization with the \nability to carry all operation and maintenance costs, and most capital works. However, like other \nrailway organizations throughout the world, it faces heavy competition from road transport, and, \nin the case of transit traffic, competition from other countries. UTY\u2019s financial sustainability \ndepends on its ability to improve the attractiveness of its services to clients. This requires \nimproved infrastructure and rolling stock, and refinements to its business planning process. ADB \nis working with UTY on an initiative to develop and implement a long-term development strategy\u2014\na three-pronged strategy covering people, technology, and financing (footnote 3). This additional \nfinancing contributes to the first two, by pushing the boundaries of technical innovation and \nenhancing the capacity of UTY staff. \n \n11.  Impact of COVID-19. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic reinforces the need \nto strengthen the railway network. Railways have proven to be the most reliable and sought-after \nmode of transport for freight during the pandemic, while truck traffic has shrunk. Passenger traffic, \non the other hand, has been severely affected. Since the project\u2019s viability depends largely on \nfreight traffic, the impact of COVID-19 is minimal. Construction is expected to start in mid-2021 \nwhen COVID-19 is likely to have subsided and be made manageable through the government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response measures. In such a case, the project will be implemented within the planned \nimplementation period from 2021 to 2024. If COVID-19 is not contained by mid-2021, UTY will \nenact measures for resources to be mobilized steadily, albeit at a reduced speed, and for works \nto continue without serious threat to people\u2019s health.10 The project will help eastern Uzbekistan to \nbounce back\u2014revitalizing horticultural exports, reviving the ravaged tourism industry, providing \nemployment, and regaining momentum toward meeting its ambitious infrastructure plans. \n \n12.  Eligibility  for  additional  financing.  The  proposal  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  for \nadditional financing, as the overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, \nand financially sound (paras. 25\u221231); (ii) is accorded high priority by the government (para. 7); \n(iii) is consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives (para. 13); and (iv) is consistent with \nthe country partnership strategy (para. 8).11 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) stimulated economic growth in the \nFergana Valley,12 and (ii) improved connectivity and increased regional trade along CAREC \nCorridor 2.13 The project will have the following outcome: level of rail passenger and freight service \nin, to, and from the Fergana Valley improved.14 \n \n \n9  ADB. 2017.

The additional financing will \nexpand the scope of the project and add the following new outputs. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Railway  infrastructure  along  the  Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan  line \nupgraded. The design, supply, and installation of the signaling and telecommunications system \non 441 km of track will be completed, including four branch lines.15 A video surveillance system \nwill be installed to monitor the safe operation of trains. The mountainous section from Pap to \nAngren will be fitted with a landslide detection and warning system. The electric power supply will \nbe enhanced through the construction of two traction substations and two sectioning posts, and \nan upgrade to two existing traction substations.16 All traction substations will be connected to a \nsupervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) and external power supply. Machinery \nand equipment will be commissioned for the maintenance of electrified lines. The Kokand depot \nwill be upgraded to allow the servicing of electric locomotives. Two hundred of UTY\u2019s technical \nstaff, including 20 female staff, will be trained on the telecommunications and signaling systems.  \n \n16.  Output 4: Train control and management system upgraded. To allow UTY to control \nand manage all train movements in the Fergana Valley from a single central train control (CTC) \ncenter in Tashkent, (i) the CTC center in Tashkent will be upgraded; (ii) an automated train \nscheduling system will be made functional; and (iii) 30 staff members, including at least 10 female \ntechnical staff, will be trained on the modernized train control and management system.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s involvement in this project provides tangible value. First, by extending additional \nfinancing, ADB will support UTY and the government to complete the modernization of the eastern \nUzbekistan railway line in a consistent and cohesive manner. ADB supported UTY in developing \na coordinated work plan, which allows the components under the ongoing and additional financing \nprojects to be optimized and to ensure maximum synergies. For instance, the upgrades to the \nCTC center will be done in a manner that allows the whole eastern Uzbekistan railway network to \nbe operated through one unified system. Second, the technical specifications of the signaling, \ntelecommunications, video surveillance, and train management systems were improved through \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) to meet international standards and utilize state-of-the-art \ntechnology.17 Third, ADB introduced measures into the project, especially the landslide detection \nand warning system, to ensure the resilience of the upgraded line to natural disasters and climate \nchange.18 Fourth, the project will introduce gender-inclusive training (para. 36). \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n18.  The overall project is estimated to cost $341.5 million (Table 1). The additional financing \nis estimated at $164.0 million. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier \nare included in the project administration manual (PAM).19 \n \n15 The main line between Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan is 300.8 km. Branch lines are Kokand to the border with \nTajikistan, from Margilon to the border with the Kyrgyz Republic, from Margilon to Fergana 1, and from Block Post \n331 to the border with the Kyrgyz Republic (total of 140.2 km). Telecommunications (but not signaling) will be installed \non two more branch lines: Asaka\u2212Shakhrikan and Andijan 2\u2212Tetakcai (total of 33.3 km). \n16 At Temiryollobod and Angren. The government will also upgrade two more traction substations at Tuytepa and \nAkhangaran through its own resources. \n17 ADB. 2019.

The \ngovernment\u2019s contribution of $43.0 million comprises (i) taxes and duties of $22.6 million; and (ii) \ndesign and civil works and contingencies for such work, amounting to $20.4 million. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Currenta    Additional Financing    Total \nShare of  Share of \nAmount  Total  Amount  Total  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  (%)    ($ million)  (%)    ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank                 \n  OCR (regular loan)  80.0  45.1    121.0  73.8    201.0  58.9 \nGovernment  97.5  54.9    43.0  26.2    140.5  41.1 \n  Total  177.5  100.0    164.0  100.0    341.5  100.0 \nOCR = ordinary capital resources. \na  Refers to the original amount. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari estimates. \n ", "6 \n21.  For the proposed additional financing, climate mitigation is estimated to cost $162.9 million \nand climate adaptation is estimated to cost $1.1 million. ADB will finance 73.6% of mitigation costs \nand 100.0% of adaptation costs. Mitigation comprises the modernization of the railway and the \naccompanying modal shift to lower-carbon transport. Annual greenhouse gas emission reductions \nare expected to exceed 14,870 tons per annum. Adaptation comprises the installation of a \nlandslide detection and early warning system. Details are in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements remain largely unchanged from the ongoing project. \nUTY will remain the sole executing agency. The project implementation unit for the electrification \nand renewal of rolling stock (PIU-ET), which has staff experienced in IFI procedures and policies, \nwill be responsible for implementing the project. The technical and administrative departments of \nUTY will also assist the PIU-ET. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 \nand described in detail in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2020\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight bodies  Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade  \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Transport \n(ii)  Executing agency  O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Project implementation unit for electrification and renewal of rolling stock of UTY \n   (iv)  Implementation unit  Tashkent, Uzbekistan, 23 staff \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding   Traction substations and  [This \n(3 lots)  transformers; signaling and  information was \ntelecommunications and  deemed \nconfidential \ninstallation of SCADA; video \naccording to \nsurveillance system (plant) \nparagraph 17 \nOpen competitive bidding   Machinery and equipment for  (viii) of ADB\u2019s \n(4 lots)  railway maintenance (goods)   Access to \nDirect contracting  Train management system at  Information \ncentral train control (plant)  Policy (2018).] \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  Engineering and works \nselection (90:10)  supervision (238 person-months) \nRetroactive financing and  Advance contracting action will be taken on all procurement packages. \nadvance contracting  Retroactive financing will be allowed up to 20% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SCADA = supervisory control and data acquisition system, UTY = O\u2019zbekiston Temir \nYo\u2019llari. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.  All procurement financed under the ADB loan will be undertaken in adherence with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Open competitive bidding will apply to \n(i) the plant package for traction substations and transformers, signaling and telecommunications \nand the installation of SCADA, and the video surveillance system; and (ii) the goods package for \nthe machinery and equipment for railway maintenance\u2014both under the one-stage, one-envelope \nmethod, without prequalification. For the plant procurement of the train management system, \ndirect contracting will be pursued with the supplier of the equivalent system under the ongoing \n ", "7 \nproject, to ensure full system integration.20 An engineering and works supervision consultant will \nsupport the PIU-ET in implementing the project and developing the train control and management \nsystems.  The  bidding  documents  for  the  two  packages  for  open  competitive  bidding  are \nsubstantially complete, and invitations for bids are expected to be issued in quarter 4 of 2020. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n24.  ADB provided transaction TA of $600,000, financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund, to help prepare the additional financing project (footnote 17). Due diligence was \nconducted  for  the  added  scope  arising  from  the  additional  financing,  covering  technical, \neconomic, financial, governance, social and poverty, and safeguard aspects. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  Technical viability. The technical scope of the additional financing is fully in line with the \nneed to expand the capacity of the eastern Uzbekistan railway network safely and efficiently. \nTargeted improvements to signaling, telecommunications, and the electricity supply will help to \nincrease the operational capacity in a cost-effective manner without involving major works such \nas double-tracking, which would have major adverse environmental and social impacts, as well \nas multifold increases in cost. The technical features follow well-established engineering practices \nthat are within the capacity and experience of UTY to execute. For output 3, the signaling, \ntelecommunications, and power systems are designed to be fully compatible with the systems \nbeing installed for the ongoing project. For output 4, work on the CTC center will be completed in \na way that fully integrates all sections of railway lines in the Fergana Valley under one system. \n \n26.  Operational considerations. Given that works will be made to a line with ongoing train \noperations, the project will apply adequate safety measures for on-site work. UTY will coordinate \nclosely with Joint Stock Company National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan to link the traction \nsubstations to the external power supply. A team of international consultants will assist UTY in \nthe phasing and interfacing of works. The consultant teams under the ongoing and additional \nfinancing projects will work closely together under the overall supervision of the PIU-ET. \n \n27.  Climate and disaster resilience. A climate risk assessment pointed to the need to \naccount  for  impacts  arising  from  extremely  high  temperatures  during  heat  waves  and  the \nincreasing frequency of mudflows and avalanches. In response, construction materials resistant \nto hot weather have been selected. A landfall detection and warning system will be installed under \nthe project to improve the resilience of railway services to climate-related hazards. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n28.  Economic viability. The economic analysis of the project was conducted following ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  additional  financing \ncomponents under with- and without-project scenarios.21 Passenger and freight forecasts were \nbased on an analysis of historical traffic trends, railway and road travel costs, forecast increases \nin railway demand, and historical and projected socioeconomic growth trends; and accounted for \nthe economic impact of COVID-19. The project will increase the capacity and improve the \n \n20 Justified in line with the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers, para. 2.17 (e), where works are a natural \nextension of an earlier or ongoing job that was awarded following a competitive process, and where the engagement \nof the same contractor is more economical and will ensure compatibility of results in terms of quality of work. \n21 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nefficiency of railway operations, which will divert traffic from road-based modes and cater to \nsuppressed demand that would not be met without the project. Project benefits include (i) time \nsavings for freight and passenger traffic, (ii) vehicle operating cost savings for diverted traffic, \n(iii) carbon dioxide emission savings, and (iv) traction and locomotive maintenance savings. The \nproject is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 14.5% and a net present \nvalue of $74.8 million at a 9.0% discount rate. It remains viable even with (i) a 10% increase in \nproject costs, (ii) a 10% reduction in project benefits, (iii) a 10% increase in capital costs and 10% \ndecrease in project benefits, (iv) projections of dampened gross domestic product growth in \n2021\u20132022 because of COVID-19, and (v) a 2-year delay in the realization of project benefits. 22  \n \n29.  Financial viability. The project is revenue-generating and its financial viability was \nassessed following ADB\u2019s guidelines by comparing the incremental costs and revenues of the \nadditional financing components in the with- and without-project scenarios.23 The project will \nincrease revenues, mainly from the freight traffic that provides about 88.0% of UTY\u2019s total \nrevenues. It will also reduce the operation and maintenance costs of traction and locomotives. \nThe financial internal rate of return is estimated at 8.2% and exceeds the calculated weighted \naverage cost of capital of 1.62%. The project remains financially viable even with (i) a 10% \nincrease in costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in revenues, (iii) a 10% increase in costs and 10% decrease \nin revenues, and (iv) a 2-year delay in implementation. 24 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n30.  Financial and institutional sustainability. UTY operates a profitable business, mainly \nbecause of its freight revenues, and has maintained an enviable status as one of the few \nfinancially self-sustaining railway entities in the world. However, the operating income ratio, which \nincludes depreciation, decreased from 0.33 in 2017 to 0.14 in 2019, mainly because of the poor \nfinancial performance of its noncore businesses, especially coal production. The government has \ndecreed for coal production to be taken out of UTY\u2019s management, and is removing other noncore \nbusinesses by 30 June 2021. With these measures, the operating income ratio is expected to \nincrease to 0.18 by 2030. The long-term debt\u2212equity ratio is forecast to decrease gradually from \n3.7 in 2020 to 1.2 by 2030, while the debt service coverage ratio is forecast to increase from 2.0 in \n2020 to 3.2 by 2030. Overall, UTY maintains the financial capacity to implement the project, fund \nits contribution to the project costs, repay the loan, and make the required payments on its existing \ndebt. To ensure the future financial health of UTY, the project includes loan covenants (i) on the \noperating income ratio of UTY, which shall be maintained above 0.1 from fiscal year 2021 onward; \nand (ii) for the government to pass an official decree to remove other noncore businesses from \nUTY and to avoid adding such businesses to UTY in the future. ADB will continue policy dialogue \nand support UTY in developing and implementing its long-term development strategy to ensure \noperational efficiency and financial sustainability. \n \n31.  Debt sustainability. In 2019, Uzbekistan\u2019s external debt was $23.4 billion or 43.5% of \ngross domestic product, with $4.5 billion outstanding to ADB. The government has pursued a \nprudent debt policy with low public and external debt, and internal mechanisms to control annual \nborrowing thresholds, while the significant official reserves of $29.2 billion in 2019 provide a buffer \nagainst potential distress concerns.25 The public debt\u2013gross domestic product ratio is projected \n \n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. 2005.

Governance \n \n32.  Financial  management.  An  updated  financial  management  assessment  of  UTY \nconducted in January 2020 confirmed that UTY\u2019s current financial management arrangements \nare sufficient to implement the project in compliance with ADB requirements. UTY has built on \nprior and ongoing ADB project experience, retaining adequate staff, undertaking disbursements \nbased on ADB rules, and adhering to acceptable accounting standards for project reporting. The \nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial because of remaining risks in \nthe management of foreign exchange risks, the acquisition of noncore businesses from the \ngovernment,  compliance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  the \ntimeliness and accuracy of monitoring and reporting, and accounting system and reporting \nintegration within UTY. In this respect, UTY shall, among others (i) carefully monitor its foreign \ncurrency reserves and develop measures to hedge against currency fluctuations, (ii) remove \nnoncore businesses, (iii) attend training organized by ADB on financial management, (iv) move \nto multiyear contracts for auditors and conduct midyear interim audit missions to reduce delays in \nthe preparation of financial statements, (v) engage external consultants and a valuation company \nto address the qualified audit opinion, and (vi) accelerate the integration of the accounting system. \nDetails of the risks and key mitigating measures are in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n33.  Procurement.  Procurement  arrangements  were  prepared  based  on  strategic \nprocurement planning and comprises three packages (Table 3). For the procurement of plant for \ntraction substations, signaling and telecommunications, and video surveillance, it was assessed \nthat by grouping these components into one package with three lots, a high level of competition \nwould be obtained while also reducing the PIU\u2019s transactional costs in conducting multiple \ntenders. For the train management system (Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan section), a different \napproach was adopted since this system will need to be seamlessly interfaced with a similar \nsystem under development (Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan section). For this reason, this component \nwill be awarded on a direct contracting basis to the firm installing the equivalent system on the \nPap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan section (footnote 20). \n \n34.  A project procurement risk assessment confirmed that UTY has sufficient experience and \nstaff skills in procurement. The procurement risk is assessed as moderate. However, the risk \nassessment  identified  some  capacity  issues  of  the  PIU-ET  in  managing  international \nprocurement. Although PIU-ET staff are experienced in ADB-financed projects, their unfamiliarity \nwith the new ADB Procurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers could \nresult in delays in the preparation and approval of bidding documents, and the conduct of bidding. \nADB has provided training to PIU-ET procurement staff in this regard. The transaction TA is \nproviding on-the-job training and assisting the PIU-ET in managing procurement during project \npreparation.  After  the  project  becomes  effective,  the  engineering  and  works  supervision \nconsultants will support procurement. \n \n35.  Integrity and anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and UTY. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n \n26 International Monetary Fund. 2020. Republic of Uzbekistan: Requests for Disbursement under the Rapid Credit \nFacility and Rapid Financing Instrument\u2014Debt Sustainability Analysis. Washington, DC. \n ", "10 \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  An  updated social  and  poverty  assessment  ascertained  that  the  overall  project will \ncontribute to reducing transport costs and travel time; ensure safety; and increase access to jobs, \nmarkets, health care, and education facilities for the local population.27 The primary beneficiaries \nwill be freight transporters (including agro-industrial producers) and passengers (especially the \nuniversity community, which is the primary user of the railway). New jobs will be created during \nimplementation and operation. Women and children will have access to safe transport, with \ngender-inclusive facilities on trains and at modernized stations. Currently, women and children \nface unsafe and crowded travel conditions in informal taxis and vans, which pose a higher risk of \ninfections from COVID-19 because of the difficulty of applying social distancing measures. \nModernization of the railway will increase the opportunities for tourism development in the \nFergana Valley and contribute to the creation of new jobs in the tourism  segment, which \ntraditionally employs women. The additional financing is classified some gender elements. It will \nsupport the empowerment of women employees of UTY, by extending training on modernized \nsignaling and telecommunications for at least 20 women staff. At least 10 women staff of UTY will \nbe trained in train management systems. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n37.  Overall assessment. The impact of the additional financing on environment and social \nsafeguards is minimal, since works will take place on the existing right-of-way.  \n \n38.  Associated and existing facilities. External power supply lines have been built using \ngovernment funds, linking the two new traction substations to be built at Asaka and Kokand with \nthe power grid. These are treated as associated facilities. UTY acquired the sites for the two new \ntraction substations in 2016 and initiated construction of buildings on one of them\u2014none of which \nwas in anticipation of the ADB financing. These are treated as existing facilities. \n \n39.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n  \n40.  Environment (category B). By enhancing the safety and efficiency of a clean mode of \ntransport, the project will contribute to a reduction in local pollutants as well as greenhouse gases. \nConcerns regarding potential environmental impacts are largely temporary and confined to certain \nlocations, i.e., the location of new traction substations, occurring during construction. The project \nactivities will have site-specific impacts such as dust emissions, noise, and waste generation, so \noccupational and community health and safety and mitigation measures will be required.   \n \n41.  UTY, with the support of the transaction TA, has prepared an initial environmental \nexamination (including an environmental management plan) to cover all the relevant project \ncomponents. The initial environmental examination also includes a due diligence assessment and \ncorrective  action  plans  for  associated  and  existing  facilities  (para.  38).  The  environmental \nmanagement plan provides mitigation and monitoring measures, as well as a capacity-building \nplan. Contractors will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures. UTY\u2019s PIU-ET \nhas full-time safeguard staff with access to monitoring equipment for air quality, noise, and \nvibration.  They  will  be  assisted  in  their  tasks  by  the  engineering  and  works  supervision \nconsultants. With regard to existing and associated facilities, UTY will implement the corrective \n \n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \naction plans, with assistance from engineering and works supervision consultants, if required. \nUTY conducted meaningful and full public consultations regarding all project components, as well \nas the existing and associated facilities. \n \n42.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). No additional land acquisition and resettlement \nwill arise from the additional financing. All project activities will be done within the existing right-\nof-way of UTY. For the associated and existing facilities, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequires the assessment of impacts and risks to the project. A social due diligence and audit has \nbeen conducted, and corrective actions have been developed and summarized in the resulting \nsocial due diligence report.29 UTY completed one key corrective action\u2014the completion of \ncompensation to three affected households\u2014in August 2020. Pending actions include expanding \nthe  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  to  cover  the  scope  of  the  additional  financing, \nstrengthening information disclosure and stakeholder engagement, and conducting monitoring \nthroughout the project implementation.  \n \n43.  UTY has a dedicated safeguard specialist who will supervise the implementation of the \ncorrective action plan, assisted by the supervision consultants. It will conduct regular monitoring \nof project activities for any emerging land acquisition and resettlement issues and grievances that \nmay  be  raised  by  stakeholders  and  communities  during  implementation.  UTY  will  provide \nsemiannual monitoring reports to ADB on the implementation of the corrective action plan. UTY \nwill ensure that no physical or economic displacement will occur until compensation is paid and \nassistance is provided to the affected persons.   \n  \n44.  Grievance  redress  mechanism.  UTY  has  established  a  two-level  GRM  under  the \nongoing project, involving (i) the nearest railway station, and (ii) UTY\u2019s secretariat in Tashkent. \nAs a third channel, aggrieved persons can approach any competent court at any stage of the \ncomplaint. The GRM will be expanded to cover the components under the additional financing. \nThe PIU-ET will ensure that grievances and complaints on any aspect of the land acquisition, \ncompensation, and resettlement are addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner through the \nGRM. UTY, through the PIU-ET and engineering and works supervision consultants, will ensure \nthat meaningful consultations are carried out with the affected persons throughout the project \ncycle with particular attention to the needs of the vulnerable and the disadvantaged groups. \n \n45.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The country in general, and the project area in \nparticular, does not have indigenous peoples\u2019 communities as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement for operational purposes. No further action is required. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n46.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30  \n \n   \n \n29 ADB. 2013.
