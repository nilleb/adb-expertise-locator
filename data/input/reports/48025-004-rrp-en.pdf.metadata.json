It will eliminate gaps in signaling and telecommunications systems \nthat  are  crucial  for  the  safe  and  efficient  operation  of  trains;  boost  the  amount  of  freight  and \npassenger trains; reduce the risk of trains from landslides; and improve the capacity of railway \nstaff, including women, in modern train management techniques. The project will improve regional \nconnectivity along CAREC Corridor 2, and contribute to railway-driven trade. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nNeed  to  complete  modernization  of  railways  in  eastern  Uzbekistan.  The  4,735  km \n3. \nrailway network is the backbone of Uzbekistan\u2019s economy, carrying 30%\u201340% of the country\u2019s \nfreight and 3%\u20134% of its passenger traffic.2 The railway network in eastern Uzbekistan consists \nof  a  loop  linking  major  cities  in  the  Fergana  Valley  (Pap,  Namangan,  Andijan,  Margilan,  and \nKokand); and a line from Pap through the mountainous Kamchik Pass to Angren and Tashkent. \nBranch lines extend into the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. Most of these lines were built in the \nSoviet era and were designed to be used by a lower number of trains that ran on steam and later \ndiesel  power.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  have  been  making  coordinated  efforts  to \nsupport the government in modernizing Uzbekistan\u2019s railway system.3 \n \nOngoing project. The ongoing project is a key part of such efforts, helping to electrify the \n4. \n145.1  km \ninstall  signaling  and \ntelecommunications systems. The ongoing project is performing well, as (i) the project is rated \non track under the project performance rating system, (ii) each safeguard covenant item is being \ncomplied  with,  (iii)  the  delivery  of  the  expected  outputs  is  rated  successful,  and  (iv)  the \nmanagement  of  risks  is  rated  successful.4  As  of  23  September  2020,  contract  awards  totaled \n$79.98 million (99.9% of the loan amount) and disbursement reached $61.40 million (76.8% of \nthe loan amount). \n \n\nline  between  Pap,  Namangan,  and  Andijan;  and \n\nto \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic \nof Uzbekistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 2 (Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan) Railway \nElectrification Project. Manila (Loan 3527-UZB). The loan was signed on 8 November 2017 and became effective on \n29 November 2017. The current closing date of the loan is 31 December 2021. \n\n2  Government of Uzbekistan, State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics. 2020. Cargo Transportation \nand Cargo Turnover by Type of Transport; and Transportation of Passengers and Passenger Turnover by Mode of \nTransport (accessed 19 June 2020). The freight market share of railways averages 17% in the European Union and \n25%\u201330% in North America. The passenger share of railways in the European Union with a higher population density \nis 7%. \n\n3  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Rail Transport [Nonurban]) (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n4  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fRemaining  challenges.  Permanent  signaling  and  telecommunications  systems  are \n5. \nmissing for the southern part of the Fergana loop (para. 3) between Angren, Pap, Kokand, and \nAndijan, as well as on certain branch lines. This greatly affects the efficiency and safety of train \noperations, and limits the number of trains. These works were partly envisaged to be completed \nunder the loan financed by the World Bank for the Angren\u2013Pap project.5 However, procurement \ndelays led to the cancellation of the amount associated with this component, and the loan was \nclosed  in  March  2020.  This  decision  took  place  amidst  a  challenging  procurement  landscape \nfacing  Uzbekistan  in  2017  and  2018,  where  all  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  faced \ndelays  across  all  sectors.  ADB  and  O\u2019zbekiston  Temir  Yo\u2019llari  (UTY),  the  vertically  integrated \npublic railway company, exercised patience and worked steadily with the government to formulate \nnew  procedures  that  are  fully  compatible  with  IFI  rules  and  regulations.  Since  then,  the \nimplementation of ADB-financed projects has accelerated.  \n \n6. \nEnvisaged benefits. The additional financing will expand the scope of the ongoing project \nto complete the modernization of the railway network in eastern Uzbekistan. Trains will be able to \ntravel safely and more frequently, resulting in a capacity increase of 53% for freight and 39% for \npassengers, without the need for costly works such as double-tracking. The project will reduce \nthe journey times and cost of travel for the population in the Fergana Valley. It will improve the \naccess of women and children to safer transport, with gender-inclusive facilities in trains and at \nmodernized stations (already in place). It will enhance people\u2019s access to health, education, and \nwork opportunities, most of which are in the cities of Andijan and Kokand. \n \n7. \nConsistency with national development objectives.  The project remains fully in line \nwith  Uzbekistan\u2019s  national  development  objectives.  Transport  infrastructure  is  recognized  as a \nkey  growth  driver  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  Development  Strategy,  2017\u20132021\u2014to  promote  economic \ndevelopment and liberalization, and support the development of the social sectors.6 The strategy \nspecifically mentions the importance of improving transport services, raising passenger safety, \nand reducing harmful emissions. \n \n8. \nConsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030.  The  additional  financing  further  boosts  the \nproject\u2019s contribution to ADB\u2019s operational priorities of (i) tackling climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and ensuring environmental sustainability; (ii) strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity; (iii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iv) fostering regional \ncooperation and integration.7 The expansion of a modernized railway network will cut greenhouse \ngases and reduce local air pollution. The improved efficiency of train services will reduce journey \ntime, improve service quality and reliability on Uzbekistan\u2019s transport network, and strengthen the \nconditions for the private sector to grow. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20122023, which calls for investments in the transport sector and the \nmodernization of railway infrastructure.8 \n \nContribution to regional connectivity. The project railway is part of CAREC Corridor 2 \n9. \nand designated rail corridors 202 and 203, which serve the vital east\u2013west trade corridor linking \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, through Central Asia, to Europe. Regional benefits envisaged \ninclude  reduced  time  and  increased  efficiency  of  cross-border  transport,  improved  access  for \nbusinesses  in  the  Fergana  Valley  to  markets  in  neighboring  countries  and  vice  versa,  and \n\n \n5  World Bank.

The project will enhance the transit role of Uzbekistan, facilitating the trade in \nagricultural goods produced from the Fergana Valley. The project thereby contributes to the goal \nof  the  CAREC  Railway  Strategy  2030  to  make  railways  a  mode  of  choice  for  trade\u2014quick, \nefficient, accessible to customers, and easy to use throughout the region.9 \n \n10. \nSupporting  ongoing  reforms.  UTY  remains  a  financially  robust  organization  with  the \nability to carry all operation and maintenance costs, and most capital works. However, like other \nrailway organizations throughout the world, it faces heavy competition from road transport, and, \nin  the  case  of  transit  traffic,  competition  from  other  countries.  UTY\u2019s  financial  sustainability \ndepends  on  its  ability  to  improve  the  attractiveness  of  its  services  to  clients.  This  requires \nimproved infrastructure and rolling stock, and refinements to its business planning process. ADB \nis working with UTY on an initiative to develop and implement a long-term development strategy\u2014\na three-pronged strategy covering people, technology, and financing (footnote 3). This additional \nfinancing  contributes  to  the  first  two,  by  pushing  the  boundaries  of  technical  innovation  and \nenhancing the capacity of UTY staff. \n \nImpact of COVID-19. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic reinforces the need \n11. \nto strengthen the railway network. Railways have proven to be the most reliable and sought-after \nmode of transport for freight during the pandemic, while truck traffic has shrunk. Passenger traffic, \non the other hand, has been severely affected. Since the project\u2019s viability depends largely on \nfreight traffic, the impact of COVID-19 is minimal. Construction is expected to start in mid-2021 \nwhen COVID-19 is likely to have subsided and be made manageable through the government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response measures. In such a case, the project will be implemented within the planned \nimplementation period from 2021 to 2024. If COVID-19 is not contained by mid-2021, UTY will \nenact measures for resources to be mobilized steadily, albeit at a reduced speed, and for works \nto continue without serious threat to people\u2019s health.10 The project will help eastern Uzbekistan to \nbounce back\u2014revitalizing horticultural exports, reviving the ravaged tourism industry, providing \nemployment, and regaining momentum toward meeting its ambitious infrastructure plans. \n \n12. \nEligibility  for  additional  financing.  The  proposal  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  for \nadditional financing, as the overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, \nand financially sound (paras. 25\u221231); (ii) is accorded high priority by the government (para. 7); \n(iii) is consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives (para. 13); and (iv) is consistent with \nthe country partnership strategy (para. 8).11 \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) stimulated economic growth in the \nFergana  Valley,12  and  (ii)  improved  connectivity  and  increased  regional  trade  along  CAREC \nCorridor 2.13 The project will have the following outcome: level of rail passenger and freight service \nin, to, and from the Fergana Valley improved.14 \n \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n9  ADB. 2017.

The additional financing will \n\n14. \nexpand the scope of the project and add the following new outputs. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Railway  infrastructure  along  the  Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan  line \nupgraded. The design, supply, and installation of the signaling and telecommunications system \non 441 km of track will be completed, including four branch lines.15 A video surveillance system \nwill  be  installed  to  monitor  the  safe  operation  of  trains.  The  mountainous  section  from  Pap  to \nAngren will be fitted with a landslide detection and warning system. The electric power supply will \nbe enhanced through the construction of two traction substations and two sectioning posts, and \nan upgrade to two existing traction substations.16 All traction substations will be connected to a \nsupervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) and external power supply. Machinery \nand equipment will be commissioned for the maintenance of electrified lines. The Kokand depot \nwill be upgraded to allow the servicing of electric locomotives. Two hundred of UTY\u2019s technical \nstaff, including 20 female staff, will be trained on the telecommunications and signaling systems.  \n \n16. \nOutput 4: Train control and management system upgraded. To allow UTY to control \nand manage all train movements in the Fergana Valley from a single central train control (CTC) \ncenter  in  Tashkent,  (i)  the  CTC  center  in  Tashkent  will  be  upgraded;  (ii)  an  automated  train \nscheduling system will be made functional; and (iii) 30 staff members, including at least 10 female \ntechnical staff, will be trained on the modernized train control and management system.  \n \nC. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s involvement in this project provides tangible value. First, by extending additional \nfinancing, ADB will support UTY and the government to complete the modernization of the eastern \nUzbekistan railway line in a consistent and cohesive manner. ADB supported UTY in developing \na coordinated work plan, which allows the components under the ongoing and additional financing \nprojects to be optimized and to ensure maximum synergies. For instance, the upgrades to the \nCTC center will be done in a manner that allows the whole eastern Uzbekistan railway network to \nbe  operated  through  one  unified  system.  Second,  the  technical  specifications  of the  signaling, \ntelecommunications, video surveillance, and train management systems were improved through \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) to meet international standards and utilize state-of-the-art \ntechnology.17 Third, ADB introduced measures into the project, especially the landslide detection \nand warning system, to ensure the resilience of the upgraded line to natural disasters and climate \nchange.18 Fourth, the project will introduce gender-inclusive training (para. 36). \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe overall project is estimated to cost $341.5 million (Table 1).

Due diligence was \nconducted  for  the  added  scope  arising  from  the  additional  financing,  covering  technical, \neconomic, financial, governance, social and poverty, and safeguard aspects. \n \nA. \n \n25. \nTechnical viability. The technical scope of the additional financing is fully in line with the \nneed  to  expand  the  capacity  of  the  eastern  Uzbekistan  railway  network  safely  and  efficiently. \nTargeted improvements to signaling, telecommunications, and the electricity supply will help to \nincrease the operational capacity in a cost-effective manner without involving major works such \nas double-tracking, which would have major adverse environmental and social impacts, as well \nas multifold increases in cost. The technical features follow well-established engineering practices \nthat  are  within  the  capacity  and  experience  of  UTY  to  execute.  For  output  3,  the  signaling, \ntelecommunications, and power systems are designed to be fully compatible with the systems \nbeing installed for the ongoing project. For output 4, work on the CTC center will be completed in \na way that fully integrates all sections of railway lines in the Fergana Valley under one system. \n \n26. \nOperational considerations. Given that works will be made to a line with ongoing train \noperations, the project will apply adequate safety measures for on-site work. UTY will coordinate \nclosely with Joint  Stock Company  National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan to  link the traction \nsubstations to the external power supply. A team of international consultants will assist UTY in \nthe  phasing  and  interfacing  of  works.  The  consultant  teams  under  the  ongoing  and  additional \nfinancing projects will work closely together under the overall supervision of the PIU-ET. \n \nClimate  and  disaster  resilience.  A  climate  risk  assessment  pointed  to  the  need  to \n27. \naccount  for  impacts  arising  from  extremely  high  temperatures  during  heat  waves  and  the \nincreasing frequency of mudflows and avalanches. In response, construction materials resistant \nto hot weather have been selected. A landfall detection and warning system will be installed under \nthe project to improve the resilience of railway services to climate-related hazards. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic viability. The economic analysis of the project was conducted following ADB\u2019s \n28. \nguidelines  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  additional  financing \ncomponents under with- and without-project scenarios.21 Passenger and freight forecasts were \nbased on an analysis of historical traffic trends, railway and road travel costs, forecast increases \nin railway demand, and historical and projected socioeconomic growth trends; and accounted for \nthe  economic  impact  of  COVID-19.  The  project  will  increase  the  capacity  and  improve  the \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \n\n20 Justified  in  line  with  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers,  para.  2.17  (e),  where  works  are  a  natural \nextension of an earlier or ongoing job that was awarded following a competitive process, and where the engagement \nof the same contractor is more economical and will ensure compatibility of results in terms of quality of work. \n\n21 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\nefficiency  of  railway  operations,  which  will  divert  traffic  from  road-based  modes  and  cater  to \nsuppressed demand that would not be met without the project. Project benefits include (i) time \nsavings  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic,  (ii)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  for  diverted  traffic, \n(iii) carbon dioxide emission savings, and (iv) traction and locomotive maintenance savings. The \nproject is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 14.5% and a net present \nvalue of $74.8 million at a 9.0% discount rate. It remains viable even with (i) a 10% increase in \nproject costs, (ii) a 10% reduction in project benefits, (iii) a 10% increase in capital costs and 10% \ndecrease  in  project  benefits,  (iv)  projections  of  dampened  gross  domestic  product  growth  in \n2021\u20132022 because of COVID-19, and (v) a 2-year delay in the realization of project benefits. 22  \n \n29. \nFinancial  viability.  The  project  is  revenue-generating  and  its  financial  viability  was \nassessed following  ADB\u2019s guidelines by comparing  the incremental costs and revenues of the \nadditional  financing  components  in  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.23  The  project  will \nincrease  revenues,  mainly  from  the  freight  traffic  that  provides  about  88.0%  of  UTY\u2019s  total \nrevenues. It will also reduce the operation and maintenance costs of traction and locomotives. \nThe financial internal rate of return is estimated at 8.2% and exceeds the calculated weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  1.62%.  The  project  remains  financially  viable  even  with  (i)  a  10% \nincrease in costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in revenues, (iii) a 10% increase in costs and 10% decrease \nin revenues, and (iv) a 2-year delay in implementation. 24 \n \nC. \n \n30. \nFinancial and institutional sustainability. UTY operates a profitable business, mainly \nbecause  of  its  freight  revenues,  and  has  maintained  an  enviable  status  as  one  of  the  few \nfinancially self-sustaining railway entities in the world. However, the operating income ratio, which \nincludes depreciation, decreased from 0.33 in 2017 to 0.14 in 2019, mainly because of the poor \nfinancial performance of its noncore businesses, especially coal production. The government has \ndecreed for coal production to be taken out of UTY\u2019s management, and is removing other noncore \nbusinesses by 30 June 2021. With  these measures, the operating income ratio  is expected to \nincrease to 0.18 by 2030. The long-term debt\u2212equity ratio is forecast to decrease gradually from \n3.7 in 2020 to 1.2 by 2030, while the debt service coverage ratio is forecast to increase from 2.0 in \n2020 to 3.2 by 2030. Overall, UTY maintains the financial capacity to implement the project, fund \nits contribution to the project costs, repay the loan, and make the required payments on its existing \ndebt. To ensure the future financial health of UTY, the project includes loan covenants (i) on the \noperating income ratio of UTY, which shall be maintained above 0.1 from fiscal year 2021 onward; \nand (ii) for the government to pass an official decree to remove other noncore businesses from \nUTY and to avoid adding such businesses to UTY in the future. ADB will continue policy dialogue \nand support UTY in developing and implementing its long-term development strategy to ensure \noperational efficiency and financial sustainability. \n \nDebt sustainability. In 2019, Uzbekistan\u2019s external debt was $23.4 billion or 43.5% of \n31. \ngross  domestic  product,  with  $4.5  billion  outstanding  to  ADB.  The  government  has  pursued  a \nprudent debt policy with low public and external debt, and internal mechanisms to control annual \nborrowing thresholds, while the significant official reserves of $29.2 billion in 2019 provide a buffer \nagainst potential distress concerns.25 The public debt\u2013gross domestic product ratio is projected \n\n \n\n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. 2005.

An  updated  financial  management  assessment  of  UTY \nconducted in  January 2020  confirmed  that  UTY\u2019s  current  financial  management  arrangements \nare sufficient to implement the project in compliance with ADB requirements. UTY has built on \nprior and ongoing ADB project experience, retaining adequate staff, undertaking disbursements \nbased on ADB rules, and adhering to acceptable accounting standards for project reporting. The \nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial because of remaining risks in \nthe  management  of  foreign  exchange  risks,  the  acquisition  of  noncore  businesses  from  the \ngovernment,  compliance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  the \ntimeliness  and  accuracy  of  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  accounting  system  and  reporting \nintegration within UTY. In this respect, UTY shall, among others (i) carefully monitor its foreign \ncurrency  reserves  and  develop  measures  to  hedge  against  currency  fluctuations,  (ii)  remove \nnoncore businesses, (iii) attend training organized by ADB on financial management, (iv) move \nto multiyear contracts for auditors and conduct midyear interim audit missions to reduce delays in \nthe preparation of financial statements, (v) engage external consultants and a valuation company \nto address the qualified audit opinion, and (vi) accelerate the integration of the accounting system. \nDetails of the risks and key mitigating measures are in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n33. \nProcurement.  Procurement  arrangements  were  prepared  based  on  strategic \nprocurement planning and comprises three packages (Table 3). For the procurement of plant for \ntraction substations, signaling and telecommunications, and video surveillance, it was assessed \nthat by grouping these components into one package with three lots, a high level of competition \nwould  be  obtained  while  also  reducing  the  PIU\u2019s  transactional  costs  in  conducting  multiple \ntenders.  For  the  train  management  system  (Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan  section),  a  different \napproach  was  adopted  since  this  system  will  need  to  be  seamlessly  interfaced  with  a  similar \nsystem under development (Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan section). For this reason, this component \nwill be awarded on a direct contracting basis to the firm installing the equivalent system on the \nPap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan section (footnote 20). \n \n34. \nA project procurement risk assessment confirmed that UTY has sufficient experience and \nstaff  skills  in  procurement.  The  procurement  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate.  However,  the  risk \nassessment  identified  some  capacity  issues  of  the  PIU-ET  in  managing  international \nprocurement. Although PIU-ET staff are experienced in ADB-financed projects, their unfamiliarity \nwith the new ADB Procurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers could \nresult in delays in the preparation and approval of bidding documents, and the conduct of bidding. \nADB  has  provided  training  to  PIU-ET  procurement  staff  in  this  regard.  The  transaction  TA  is \nproviding on-the-job training and assisting the PIU-ET in managing procurement during project \npreparation.  After  the  project  becomes  effective,  the  engineering  and  works  supervision \nconsultants will support procurement. \n \n35. \nIntegrity and anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and UTY. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n\n26 International  Monetary  Fund.  2020.

The impact of the additional financing on environment and social \n\nE. \n \n36. \nAn  updated  social  and  poverty  assessment  ascertained  that  the  overall  project  will \ncontribute to reducing transport costs and travel time; ensure safety; and increase access to jobs, \nmarkets, health care, and education facilities for the local population.27 The primary beneficiaries \nwill be freight transporters (including agro-industrial producers) and passengers (especially the \nuniversity community, which is the primary user of the railway). New jobs will be created during \nimplementation  and  operation.  Women  and  children  will  have  access  to  safe  transport,  with \ngender-inclusive facilities on trains and at modernized stations. Currently, women and children \nface unsafe and crowded travel conditions in informal taxis and vans, which pose a higher risk of \ninfections  from  COVID-19  because  of  the  difficulty  of  applying  social  distancing  measures. \nModernization  of  the  railway  will  increase  the  opportunities  for  tourism  development  in  the \nFergana  Valley  and  contribute  to  the  creation  of  new  jobs  in  the  tourism  segment,  which \ntraditionally employs women. The additional financing is classified some gender elements. It will \nsupport the empowerment of women employees of UTY, by extending training on modernized \nsignaling and telecommunications for at least 20 women staff. At least 10 women staff of UTY will \nbe trained in train management systems. \n \nF. \n \n37. \nsafeguards is minimal, since works will take place on the existing right-of-way.  \n \n38. \nAssociated and existing facilities.  External power supply lines have been built  using \ngovernment funds, linking the two new traction substations to be built at Asaka and Kokand with \nthe power grid. These are treated as associated facilities. UTY acquired the sites for the two new \ntraction substations in 2016 and initiated construction of buildings on one of them\u2014none of which \nwas in anticipation of the ADB financing. These are treated as existing facilities. \n \n39. \ncategories are as follows.28 \n  \nEnvironment (category B). By enhancing the safety and efficiency of a clean mode of \n40. \ntransport, the project will contribute to a reduction in local pollutants as well as greenhouse gases. \nConcerns regarding potential environmental impacts are largely temporary and confined to certain \nlocations, i.e., the location of new traction substations, occurring during construction. The project \nactivities will have site-specific impacts such as dust emissions, noise, and waste generation, so \noccupational and community health and safety and mitigation measures will be required.   \n \n41. \nUTY,  with  the  support  of  the  transaction  TA,  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (including  an  environmental  management  plan)  to  cover  all  the  relevant  project \ncomponents. The initial environmental examination also includes a due diligence assessment and \ncorrective  action  plans  for  associated  and  existing  facilities  (para.  38).  The  environmental \nmanagement plan provides mitigation and monitoring measures, as well as a capacity-building \nplan. Contractors will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures.

No additional land acquisition and resettlement \n42. \nwill arise from the additional financing. All project activities will be done within the existing right-\nof-way  of  UTY.  For  the  associated  and  existing  facilities,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequires the assessment of impacts and risks to the project. A social due diligence and audit has \nbeen conducted, and corrective actions have been developed and summarized in the resulting \nsocial  due  diligence  report.29  UTY  completed  one  key  corrective  action\u2014the  completion  of \ncompensation to three affected households\u2014in August 2020. Pending actions include expanding \nthe  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  to  cover  the  scope  of  the  additional  financing, \nstrengthening  information  disclosure  and  stakeholder  engagement,  and  conducting  monitoring \nthroughout the project implementation.  \n \n43. \nUTY has a dedicated safeguard specialist who will supervise the implementation of the \ncorrective action plan, assisted by the supervision consultants. It will conduct regular monitoring \nof project activities for any emerging land acquisition and resettlement issues and grievances that \nmay  be  raised  by  stakeholders  and  communities  during  implementation.  UTY  will  provide \nsemiannual monitoring reports to ADB on the implementation of the corrective action plan. UTY \nwill ensure that no physical or economic displacement will occur until compensation is paid and \nassistance is provided to the affected persons.   \n  \n44. \nGrievance  redress  mechanism.  UTY  has  established  a  two-level  GRM  under  the \nongoing project, involving (i) the nearest railway station, and (ii) UTY\u2019s secretariat in Tashkent. \nAs  a  third  channel,  aggrieved  persons  can  approach  any competent  court  at  any  stage  of  the \ncomplaint. The GRM will be expanded to cover the components under the additional financing. \nThe  PIU-ET  will  ensure  that  grievances  and  complaints  on  any  aspect  of  the  land  acquisition, \ncompensation, and resettlement are addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner through the \nGRM. UTY, through the PIU-ET and engineering and works supervision consultants, will ensure \nthat  meaningful  consultations  are  carried  out  with  the  affected  persons  throughout  the  project \ncycle with particular attention to the needs of the vulnerable and the disadvantaged groups. \n \n45. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  country  in  general,  and  the  project  area  in \nparticular, does not have indigenous peoples\u2019 communities as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement for operational purposes. No further action is required. \n \nG. \n \n46. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30  \n \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n29 ADB.  2013.

The \ncoal business was removed in March 2020. The government will \npass another decree to (i) remove other noncore businesses from \nUTY, and (ii) prevent UTY from acquiring noncore businesses in \nthe future. Compliance with this decree will be monitored by ADB \non an annual basis. \nAdvance contracting action will be undertaken using electronic \nprocurement. UTY and its contractors will develop and implement \nmitigation plans that include health-related measures to prevent \nand stem the spread of COVID-19, as well as post-COVID-19 \npandemic activities to make up for any time lost because of the \npandemic. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  IFRS  =  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards, UTY = O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and UTY have assured ADB that project implementation shall conform \n47. \nto  all  applicable  ADB  requirements,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement, \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n48. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  and  UTY  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n49. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$121,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Central  Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  Corridor  2  (Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan)  Railway  Electrification \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n19 October 2020 \n\n \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nThe  revised  design  and  monitoring  framework  strikes  out  content  for  deletion  and  underlines \ncontent to be added. \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nStimulated economic growth in the Fergana Valleya \nImproved connectivity and increased regional trade along CAREC Corridor 2 (CAREC Transport and Trade \nFacilitation Strategy 2020)b \n\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \n \na.\u2013b.
