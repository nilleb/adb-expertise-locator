The  report  also  describes  proposed  TA  for  Capacity  Building  for \nSecondary Towns and Strategic Cities, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.   \n\nThe  proposed  facility  will  strengthen  project  readiness  and  institutional  capacity  in  the \n2. \nurban sector by (i) completing advanced feasibility studies and detailed designs for urban projects \nwith  climate  and  disaster  resilience  and  gender-friendly  features; 1  (ii)  providing  advanced \nimplementation support through the preparation of bidding documents for advanced contracting, \nand  safeguard  documents;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  institutional  capacities  of  implementing \nagencies during the inception period of project implementation. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector performance and key issues. Urban projects are complex and require significant \npreparation. The experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Sri Lanka shows limited \nlong-term strategic investment planning, weak engineering capacity in urban departments, and \nlengthy  land acquisition processes.2 These  issues  lead to  (i)  lack  of  investment-grade projects \nready  for  appraisal,  (ii)  slow  start-up  and  implementation  delays,  (iii)  multiple  scope  changes, \n(iv) cost overruns, and (v) delays in the delivery of benefits to the people.3  \n \n4. \nLimited  strategic  investment  planning.  Urbanization  to  enable  agglomeration,  drive \ninnovation,  promote  environmental  sustainability,  and  boost  economic  growth  in  Sri  Lanka \ninvolves strategic planning and up-front engagement. Demand to improve urban services in city \ncenters,  such  as  Colombo,  remains,  but  demand  is  growing  for  peri-urban  and  greenfield \ndevelopment to support planned urbanization in strategic economic corridors. Planning for trunk \ninfrastructure with links to satellite towns is needed to enhance city and regional competitiveness. \nIncorporating  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  high  technology,  gender  equality,  as  well  as \naddressing governance issues adds more layers to project planning.  \n \n5. \nLimited institutional capacity to prepare and implement urban projects. The urban \nsector  in  Sri  Lanka  is  constrained  by  weak  implementing  agencies,  requiring  significant  hand-\nholding  support,  especially  in  detailed  engineering,  procurement,  contract  management,  and \nsafeguards.  Implementing  agencies  need  increased  capacities  to  address  issues  critical  for \nproject planning; execution; operation and maintenance (O&M); and other areas of sustainability \nincluding revenue generation, and financial and asset management. Key institutions in the urban \nsector include the Ministry of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports (MPCLGS), the \nMinistry  of  Megapolis  and  Western  Development  (MMWD),  the  National  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage Board, provincial councils, and local authorities. \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2017.  Country  Operations  Business  Plan:  Sri  Lanka,  2018\u20132020.  Manila.  The \nfacility will prepare two projects listed for approval in 2020\u20132021: (i) the Secondary Towns Sustainable Development \nProject ($180 million) under the MPCLGS; and (ii) the Western Megapolis Urban Infrastructure Development Project \n($200 million) under the strategic cities development program of the MMWD. \n\n2  Land acquisition in Sri Lanka takes up to 1.5 years to complete. \n3  This is accentuated when projects are dispersed across the country and partially managed by municipal entities. \n \n\n\f(iii) commencing \n\nland  acquisition  during \n\n \n6. \nValue addition  of  ADB. The following  are key  lessons from  ADB\u2019s sector  and  country \nexperience incorporated in the facility design: (i) developing high project readiness for immediate \nstart-up  and  timely  delivery  of  benefits, 4  (ii)  building  the  implementation  capacity  of  project \nthe  planning  stage  of  projects, \nagencies, \n(iv) incorporating disaster and climate resilience into project designs, (v) achieving more equitable \noutcomes  by  mainstreaming  gender,  and  (vi) demonstrating  smart  urban  solutions  through \ninnovative  pilot  projects.  The  proposed  facility  will  go  beyond  traditional  water  and  sanitation \nprojects  to  support  other  key  infrastructure  and  services  for  enhancing  urban  livability  and \neconomic  growth.  These  include  (i)  introducing  intelligent  transportation  systems  (considering \ndisability access) for traffic management and road safety; (ii) creating high-quality public spaces; \n(iii)  promoting  digital  technologies  (e.g.,  mobile  bill  payment  systems,  remote  early  warning \nsystems),  and  energy-efficient  urban  services  (e.g., solar  lighting,  green  public  buildings)  to \nreduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  improve  operational  efficiency;  and  (iv)  supporting \ninfrastructure for tourism and markets for enhanced local and regional competitiveness.5 \n \nUrbanization challenges. While 20% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population lives in urban areas, cities \n7. \ncontribute  more  than  an  estimated  40%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).    As  Sri  Lanka \napproaches  upper  middle-income  status,  a  number  of  development  challenges  continue  to \nconstrain its growth potential, including (i) unplanned urbanization; (ii) inequitable access to basic \nurban services outside of Colombo; (iii) urban environmental pollution; (iv) weak local governance \nand institutional  capacities; (v)  low  service level  indicators;6 (vi)  vulnerability  to  climate  change \nand disasters including floods, landslides, and droughts; and (vii) weak disaster risk management \ncapabilities. \n \n8. \nGovernment strategy. In its Vision 2025 and Public Investment Program (2016\u20132018), \nthe  government  articulates  its  goals  and  strategy  for  stimulating  inclusive  and  balanced \ngeographic  development  for  achieving  upper  middle-income  status. 7  The  vision  focuses  on \nimproving  access  to  and  delivery  of  urban  services,  such  as  roads,  markets,  public  spaces, \ndrainage, solid waste management, traffic management, and e-governance. Through its Strategic \nCities Development Program, overseen by the MMWD and supported by development partners,8 \nthe government aims to improve urban services in six city regions (Anuradhapura, Galle, Jaffna, \nKurunegala, Kandy, and Trincomalee).9 Through these programs, the government prioritizes full \ncoverage of urban services, especially in underserved urban areas, as well as strengthening the \ncapacity  of  local  institutions  for  improved  service  delivery.  It  also  identifies  disaster  risk \nmanagement  and  climate  change  resilience  as  priorities.10 The  government  requested  ADB  to \nsupport advanced project readiness of urban projects and to strengthen institutional capacity in \n\n                                                \n4  Advance recruitment of consultants is a good practice from ADB projects.

The facility is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 and \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022.11 \n \n9. \nEconomic corridors and strategic cities. To facilitate balanced economic development \nand growth beyond the Western Province, ADB supported the preparation of a study to develop \na comprehensive plan for the Colombo\u2013Trincomalee Economic Corridor (CTEC).12 A multisector \napproach is adopted by integrating industry, infrastructure, logistics, and urbanization within the \ncorridor.  The  CTEC  connects  urban  clusters  with  industrial  areas.  Among  the  cities  to  be \nsupported under the facility, three strategic cities (Dambulla, Kurunegala, and Trincomalee) are \nlocated within the CTEC, and included in the ensuing MMWD project (footnote 1). \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: urban projects in strategic cities and towns \nimplemented in a timely manner (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: high \nlevel of urban project readiness achieved.13 \n \nC. \n \n11. \nOutput 1: Feasibility studies and detailed designs of urban subprojects completed. \nThis  will  include  subprojects  in  up  to  29  cities  (four  strategic  cities  under  the  MMWD  and \n25 secondary towns under the MPCLGS) with climate and disaster-resilience and gender-friendly \nfeatures completed. Subprojects will comply with agreed selection criteria outlined in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).14 \n \nOutput 2: Advance implementation support for two ensuing projects provided.  The \n12. \nsupport for the two projects (footnote 1) will include (i) at least 30% of bidding documents for civil \nworks contracts prepared and tendered before ADB loan fact finding mission for ensuing projects, \n(ii) safeguard documents prepared and disclosed for the 30% bidding documents, and (iii) gender \naction plans prepared before ADB loan fact finding mission for the two ensuing projects. \n  \n13. \nOutput 3: Institutional capacity of project agencies strengthened. This output will be \nfunded under the attached transaction TA and will include (i) capacity building and implementation \nsupport  for  project  management  units  (PMUs)  and  relevant  project  agencies, 15  covering \nprocurement,  contract  management,  safeguards,  financial  management,  climate  and  disaster \nresilience,  innovative  approaches,  project  performance  monitoring,  urban  governance,  and \ngender  mainstreaming  conducted;  (ii)  a  governance  improvement  program  for  ensuing  ADB \nprojects (footnote 1) designed; and (iii) guidelines for mainstreaming gender in the design of urban \nprojects prepared and disseminated. \n \n14. \ntowns\u2014to coincide with the two pipeline projects prepared under the facility (footnote 1). \n\nThe facility will be implemented through two components\u2014strategic cities and secondary \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2017.

The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate  mainly  because \nMMWD  and  MPCLGS  have sufficient  experience in implementing  externally  funded  projects.18 \nThey have established legal, institutional, and monitoring frameworks for budgeting, accounting, \nand auditing. The project design includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) extending full \ntraining  and capacity  building  support for  enhancing  the financial  management  capacity  of  the \nMMWD  PMU,  (ii)  the  commitment  of  the  MMWD  and  MPCLGS  to  the  timely  allocation  and \ndisbursement  of the government\u2019s  counterpart funds, (iii)  providing  adequate  support  by  hiring \nthe project design and procurement consultants for enhancing the procurement capacity of the \nPMUs, and (iv) strengthening the internal audit process of the PMUs by appointing qualified staff \nor outsourcing to experienced audit firms.  \n \nthe  overall \n25. \nprocurement  risk  for  the  project  is  moderate.  The  MPCLGS  and  MMWD  have  extensive \nexperience  in  development  partner  supported  procurement,  including  ADB  in  the  case  of  the \nMPCLGS. The recruitment of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy and Procurement \nRegulations  for  ADB  Borrowers.  A  procurement  expert  recruited  under  the  attached  TA  will \nprovide additional implementation support for the MMWD. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MPCLGS and MMWD.
