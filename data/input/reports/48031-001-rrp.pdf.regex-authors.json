THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Public  Sector \nEnterprise Reforms Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  capacity  to  privatize  and \nrestructure its designated public sector enterprises (PSEs) by (i) strengthening the privatization \nprogram; (ii) improving corporate governance, structure, and management capacity in selected \nPSEs; and (iii) enhancing governance and regulatory regimes in selected sectors currently \ndominated by PSEs. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  PSEs constitute a large share of Pakistan\u2019s economy, contributing about 10% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP).2 The federal government of Pakistan has equity in more than 200 \ncommercial  and  semicommercial  organizations.  Years  of  weak  sector  and  corporate \ngovernance, corporate mismanagement, unnecessary staff recruitment, and interference by line \nministries in operational affairs have contributed to PSEs\u2019 poor service delivery and crippling \nfinancial  problems.3 Over  the  past  few  decades,  the  government  has  not  had  sufficient \ncapabilities\u2014institutional,  technical,  and  legal\u2014to  instill  sustained  improvements  in  PSE \nmanagement. Political objectives have often conflicted with commercial realities, undermining \nPSE performance and limiting commercial prospects.4 \n \n4.  Taxpayers  ultimately  bear the costs  of these  inefficiencies.  Many  PSEs  have  been \nimposing significant fiscal costs, requiring discretionary fiscal transfers and sovereign credit \nguarantees to continue operating. Without strict performance conditions and credible sunset \nclauses,  the  government  has  inadvertently  enabled  a  corporate  culture  of  soft  budget \nconstraints that removes incentives for PSEs to improve. The fiscal transfers to PSEs are \nestimated at several hundred billion Pakistan rupees per year.5 In addition to these transfers, \nPSEs had accumulated domestic debt of PRs366.5 billion and external debt of PRs205.7 billion \nequivalent by the end of December 2013.6 \n \n5.  Most PSEs suffer from low labor productivity and poor management. For key PSEs in \ninfrastructure services, such as power distribution, tariff collection is deficient and revenues are \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  J. Speakman. 2012. SOE Reform: Time for Serious Corporate Governance. World Bank Policy Paper Series on \nPakistan. PK04/12. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n3  Noteworthy for their recent poor performance are major PSEs including Pakistan International Airlines, Pakistan \nRailways, and Pakistan Steel Mills, along with regional power distribution companies and thermal power generation \ncompanies, which were under the control of the Pakistan Electric Power Company. \n4  J. Speakman. 2012. SOE Reform: Time for Serious Corporate Governance. World Bank Policy Paper Series on \nPakistan.  PK04/12.  Washington,  DC:  World  Bank;  S.  Aftab  and  S.  Shaikh.  2013.  Reforming  State-owned \nEnterprises. Pakistan Policy Note. No. 4. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n5  The government has not been able to systematically track the PSE-related fiscal losses. They can be hidden \nthrough subsidies to end users, sovereign credit guarantees, asset depreciation, and other noncash measures. \nFiscal transfers to PSEs were PRs512 billion in FY2012, of which PRs464 billion were for PSEs in the energy \nsector. World Bank. 2013. Reforming State-owned Enterprises, Pakistan Policy Note 4. Washington DC. \n6  State Bank of Pakistan. 2014. Monetary Policy Information Compendium. Karachi. ", "2 \nbelow cost-recovery levels.7 Investments are thus insufficient to ensure competitiveness, and \noverall  private  sector  growth  is  hampered  by  distorted  product  and  infrastructure  services \nmarkets. PSE service delivery is substandard. The government\u2019s footprint in the energy sector \nhas produced inefficiencies that impose fiscal costs and create a circular debt problem.8 This \nresults from inefficiencies in state-owned power sector companies, such as workforces that \nexceed  requirements  and  an  inability  to  collect  revenues.  The  direct  involvement  of  the \ngovernment in energy production and distribution has also reduced its ability to perform its \nregulatory role. Economically disadvantaged groups are not able to substitute inefficient public \nservices  with  private  sector  alternatives. The  sector  needs  to  be  revamped to  sustainably \nremove this binding constraint on Pakistan\u2019s growth. \n \n6.  The Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics \nand Privatization (MOF) is the ultimate shareholder in PSEs where the government has equity \nparticipation or full ownership.9 Within the Finance Division, the Corporate Finance Wing (CFW) \nis responsible for all financial and corporate matters related to PSEs, but its role has been \nlimited to representation  on the boards of PSEs and administration of PSE subsidies and \nguarantees. Line ministries are influential in PSE operations through (i) sector policies, (ii) \nappointment of the board (through the Prime Minister) and of the chief executing officer (before \nthe Securities Exchange Commission of Pakistan [SECP] rules were issued), (iii) representation \non PSE boards, and (iv) other indirect channels (managerial capture). The approval of subsidy \nrequests for PSEs involves the board of directors and the respective line ministry, but the CFW \nprocesses  the  request  for  the  finance  minister\u2019s  approval.  This  provides  the  CFW  with \nopportunities to exercise different levels of stringency. However, the CFW has limited technical \ncapacity and information to properly analyze and scrutinize the justification for requests, and \nthus to implement its legal mandate. The CFW recently started an assessment of the financial \nperformance of PSEs. The first report is expected to be published by December 2014. \n \n7.  Successive  governments  in  Pakistan  have  expressed  concerns  over  the  poor \nperformance of PSEs and vowed to revamp these entities. However, repeated efforts to improve \ntheir  performance  have  been  unsuccessful.  A  rising  number  of  stakeholders  now  favor \ngovernment divestiture of most PSEs through a comprehensive reform program. Encouraging \ncommitments have been made since September 2013 under a new International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) $6.7 billion extended facility:10 the government has identified 68 PSEs for privatization, of \nwhich 31 PSEs are expected to be partially privatized.11 For profitable PSEs, divestiture is \nexpected through capital market transactions. For the more problematic PSEs, partial ownership \nand management control is likely to be transferred to strategic private investors.12 However, key \n                                                \n7  For example, despite a 160% increase in power tariffs since 2008, fiscal subsidies to power distribution companies \nremain high at 1.8% of GDP, or $3.8 billion equivalent. \n8  Circular debt is the amount of payments held back by an entity from creditors, so that it can push its cash flow \nproblems down to other segments of the supply chain. In the Pakistan power sector, circular debt is the cash flow \nshortfall incurred by the sector with the Central Power Purchasing Agency at its center. \n9  Some PSEs are departmental or divisional undertakings that fall directly under the line ministry or even constitute a \ndepartment, as in the case of Pakistan Railways. These undertakings are similar to PSEs, but since they are not \ndistinguishable entities, they are here not considered as PSEs. They are part of the national budget and cannot \naccumulate debt independently, but can be costly to the budget. \n10 International Monetary Fund. 2014. IMF Country Report No. 14/90. IMF: Washington DC. \n11 Government of Pakistan, Privatisation Commission. Broad-Based Privatisation Programme of the Government. \nhttp://www.privatisation.gov.pk/Policy%20and%20Objectives/Privatisation%20Programme.htm \n12 Actions on these 31 PSEs are listed as IMF program conditions. Eleven of them\u2014in the oil and gas, banking, \ninsurance, and power sectors\u2014have been identified for privatization by block sales in the capital markets. In 17 \ncompanies\u2014mainly in the energy sector\u2014increased private sector participation is expected to improve the value of \nthe government\u2019s residual shareholding. Three PSEs in the oil and gas sectors are marked for restructuring, \nfollowed by privatization in segments. \n ", "3 \nconstraints to these PSE reforms need to be addressed to lower fiscal pressures from PSEs \nand to improve service provision and sector management. \n \n8.  The  results  of  privatization  and  restructuring  programs  have  been  mixed,  both \ninternationally and in Pakistan. Past privatization efforts in Pakistan\u2019s finance sector have been \nmore successful than those in the main infrastructure sectors. Without a strategically planned \nand paced restructuring and privatization program, it is difficult to ensure consistency and \ntransparency,  and  vested  interests  and  lawsuits  can  stifle  reforms. 13  Recent  political \ncommitments  are  yet  to  be  framed  into  a  comprehensive  and  time-bound  strategy  for \nrestructuring,  privatization,  and  governance  improvements  in  the  PSEs  and  in  the  sectors \ndominated by PSEs. An effective communications plan is also crucial to inform the public about \nthe PSE reform program and its benefits and costs. This can generate widespread public \nsupport  for  the  changes,  and  prevent  political  economy  issues  from  derailing  reform \nimplementation. Technical capacity at key agencies and coordination mechanisms between \nthem need to be strengthened. \n \n9.  TA and expert advice will also be crucial for the strategic restructuring work that many \nPSEs require before any further divestiture can take place.  However, almost a decade of \nreduced privatization activity has drained the technical capacity of the Privatisation Commission, \nwhich has seen most of its senior transaction managers and legal counsels depart. Much of the \nsenior-level institutional memory of the challenges that past privatization drives faced and how \nthose were overcome has been lost.14 The Privatisation Commission Fund does not have the \nresources needed to manage and pay for the significant pre-transaction work at key PSEs.15 \nThe  current  rules  and  practices  on  the  use  of  these  resources,  which  mix  funding  for \nprivatization  transaction  advisers  with  funding  for  the  commission\u2019s  general  operational \nexpenditures, can be improved. These shortfalls prevent the fund from becoming a transparent \nand effective tool to support privatization. The current regulatory regimes in the infrastructure \nsectors also lack appropriate institutions and rules for effective regulation  if the PSEs are \nprivatized. \n \n10.  Funding  will  also  be  required  to  meet  the  substantial  adjustment  costs  needed  to \nimplement PSE restructuring and privatization. The costs include voluntary separation schemes \nfor workers, debt legacy retirement, and potential write-off of uncollectible receivables by the \npower distribution companies (total receivables of more than PRs480 billion as of 30 June \n2013). As privatization proceeds will not accrue immediately, these revenues may not be able to \nfinance  a  substantial  part  of  the  adjustment  costs.  The  government  has  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other development partners to support the strategic policy and \n                                                \n13 An impact assessment of the last Pakistan privatization program concluded that it was a success. Of the 95 PSEs \nprivatized from 1991 to 1996, 32% performed better after privatization, 39% performed at the same level, and 29% \nperformed worse. Privatization proceeds (totaling 4.3% of GDP) had some macroeconomic significance. Key \nrecommendations to the government included (i) develop a comprehensive public awareness program, and (ii) gain \naccess to a constant source of advice on utility sector reform and regulatory matters.

In 2000, \nthe Privatisation Commission was converted into a sovereign corporate body. \n15 All privatization proceeds are deposited in a distinct and separate account called the Privatisation Fund. The fund \nis currently resourced with about $10 million equivalent. It is a revolving fund that is replenished with proceeds from \nthe privatization of PSEs.

The project will finance TA for PSE reforms, primarily in the form of consulting services. \nThis assistance is aligned with the interim country partnership strategy for Pakistan and is \nincluded  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016.16 The  country  operations \nbusiness  plan  also  includes  two  programmatic  assistance  loans  (budget  support)  to  help \naddress the adjustment costs of PSE reforms (para. 10), one of which\u2014the Sustainable Energy \nSector Reform Program (SESRP)\u2014has already been approved.17 The project will contribute to \nthe implementation of these two programmatic assistance loans by providing the government \nwith  technical  inputs  and  capacity  to  monitor  the  reforms.  The  ADB  processing  team  is \ncoordinating  its  proposed  intervention  with  other  development  partners  active  in  this  area, \nparticularly the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, the IMF, the \nUnited States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be reduced fiscal and economic costs associated with Pakistan PSEs. \nThe outcome will be successful privatization and restructuring of selected PSEs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The  project\u2019s  outputs  will  help  the  government  address  the  technical  and  policy \nrequirements of its PSE reform agenda, enabling it to (i) define a strategy that coordinates \ndifferent government agencies, sets guiding principles (such as transparency and consistency \non labor-related issues), and incorporates sequencing concerns (including important trade-offs \nbetween fiscal space and the timing of transactions); (ii) communicate effectively from the onset; \nand (iii) initiate and implement the key preparation work for PSE restructuring (pre-transaction \ntechnical  advice)  to  help  minimize  the  necessary  adjustment  costs  during  and  after \nprivatizations, and maximize any residual shareholding value after partial divestment. \n \n14.  Output  1:  Strengthened  privatization  program  (footnote  11).  The  Privatisation \nCommission will be the implementing agency for this output, which includes two sub-outputs: \n \n(i)  Output  1.1:  Transactions  management. The  project  will finance  consulting \nservices to strengthen the technical capacity of the Privatisation Commission to \nmanage privatization transactions and monitor transactions advisory services. \nThe recruitment of experienced transaction managers for the commission will \nenable it to handle more complex and more frequent transactions in parallel (and \nto  manage  transactions  advisors  effectively).  This  action  will  also  help  the \ncommission to develop a better perception of the potential market value of the \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014.

The SESRP focuses on the technical, commercial, and \nregulatory issues in the energy sector, which complements and supports outputs 1\u20133 of this project, where the \nMinistry of Water and Power (MOWP) and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources are implementing \nagencies. Project preparatory technical assistance for $500,000 is being processed to prepare the other policy-\nbased programmatic assistance loan ($400 million) to offer strategic support to the PSE reform agenda.

The \nproject will enhance the current approach to privatization, and make it more \nstrategic, well-sequenced, and time-bound with clear guidelines for prioritizing \nthe different steps required for PSE privatization. This sub-output also includes \npreparation  and  implementation  of  an  effective,  sustained,  and  preemptive \ncommunications strategy to improve transparency and ensure that the need for \nthe reforms and planned activities are widely understood and accepted by the \npublic.  A  mitigation  framework  for  labor-related  issues  arising  from  the \nprivatization  program\u2014a  key  step  to  gain  public  acceptance\u2014will  also  be \ndeveloped and implemented under this sub-output. \n \n15.  Output 2: Improved corporate governance, structure, and management capacity in \nselected public sector enterprises. The Privatisation Commission, the Finance Division of the \nMOF (the Economic Reforms Unit and the CFW), and the SECP will be the implementing \nagencies for this output, which includes two sub-outputs:  \n \n(i)  Output 2.1: Public sector enterprise restructuring. TA and expert advice will \nbe crucial for the strategic restructuring work that many PSEs require before any \nfurther divestiture can take place. The business advisory, pre-transaction work \nthat is necessary to prepare corporate restructuring proposals for key PSEs (e.g., \nbalance-sheet bifurcation proposals,18 improvement of internal financial controls \nand  financial  reporting,  and  reorientation  of  markets  and  operations)  will  be \nundertaken  under  this  sub-output.  This  work  may  involve  the  services  of \nmanagement  consultants,  accounting  and  legal  experts,  and  financial \nrestructuring experts. The government will propose the PSEs to be restructured \nunder  the  project,  which  should  meet  the  following  criteria:  (a)  the  PSE  is \nimposing significant direct and indirect costs to the federal government budget; \n(b) the government has in place a long-term vision for the sector where the PSE \noperates; and (c) the government clearly demonstrates its will to lead, guide, and \ncomplete the restructuring process within the project implementation period. \n(ii)  Output 2.2: Public sector enterprise performance monitoring. The project \nwill fund accounting, management, and financial consulting services to develop \nthe capacity of the CFW and the Economic Reforms Unit to monitor the PSE \nportfolio, assess fiscal liabilities, identify and track potential PSE issues, and \noversee  corporate  restructuring  of  selected  PSEs. The  project  will  also  help \ndevelop the analytical capacity of the CFW and the Economic Reforms Unit to \ncarry out sector benchmarking and compare performance of PSEs. The project \nwill  support  SECP  enforcement  of  PSE  compliance  with  the  new  corporate \ngovernance  rules  and  guidelines  by  establishing  interagency  coordination \nmechanisms and an online reporting and monitoring system at the SECP.19 \n \n16.

To  ensure  that \nefficiency gains in PSEs providing infrastructure services do not come at the expense of the \nconsumer, effective regulatory regimes also need to be established, particularly for ongoing \nmedium-term reforms in the energy sector (footnote 17). The Economic Reforms Unit and \nspecific regulatory agencies will oversee the work under this output, which has two sub-outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 3.1: Energy sector reform monitoring. Monitoring units for the SESRP \nwill  be  established  in the  Ministry  of Water  and  Power (MOWP)  and  in  the \nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR). These units will support \nthe ministries in preparing quarterly reform monitoring reports to be submitted to \nthe Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). TA in the regulatory, technical, \nlegal, and communications areas will be provided through the project to assist \nwith the implementation of the SESRP. Technical experts will also be hired to \nmonitor reform progress.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The  project  will  be  implemented  from  April  2015  through  31  December  2019.  The \nFinance Division of the MOF will be the executing agency. A PMU, which will be established in \nthe  Finance  Division,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  and  reporting  on \nimplementation progress. The Finance Division of the MOF and the Privatisation Commission \nwill be responsible for the procurement and recruitment of consultants. The ECC will oversee \nthe implementation of the project.20 The MPNR, MOWP, the Privatisation Commission, and the \nSECP will be the implementing agencies. ADB missions will review the implementation of the \nproject at least twice a year. \n \n21.  The MPNR and MOWP will establish units to monitor the progress of reforms in the \nenergy sector. The units will produce quarterly reports to submit to the ECC and ADB. Each \nmonitoring unit will discuss implementation issues with the PMU. The reports will be reviewed \nby  a  team  of  advisors recruited  under the  project;  the  advisors  will  give  suggestions  and \nrecommendations as part of the report. \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.21 \n \n   \n                                                \n20 The ECC is the highest economic policy-making body, formed by the Cabinet to make decisions on economic \nissues and transactions involving government interests, as well as to review key economic indicators. The ECC, \nwhich normally meets once a week, comprises all the key ministers heading economic ministries. \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2015\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion  31 December 2019 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Economic Coordination Committee \n(ii)  Executing agency  Finance Division, MOF \n(iii) Key implementing  Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources \nagencies  Ministry of Water and Power \nPrivatisation Commission \nSecurities Exchange Commission of Pakistan \n(iv) Implementation  PMU at the Finance Division, MOF (3 staff) \nunit  Monitoring units at the Ministry of Water and Power Ministry of Petroleum \nand Natural Resources \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  2 contracts  $0.5 million \nShopping  4 contracts  $0.4 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  901 person-months  $14.6 million \nICS  398 person-months  $3.3 million \nRetroactive financing  For (i) remuneration for PMU project manager, PMU procurement specialist, \nand advance  PMU  project  accountant,  and  two  transaction  managers  (individual \ncontractinga  consultants) for the Privatisation Commission; and (ii) advance payments for \n  the  energy  sector  reforms  firm,  corporate  restructuring  and  privatization \nfirm(s), and for the communications firm. \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; ICS = individual consultant selection; MOF = Ministry of Finance; PMU = project \nmanagement unit; QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na The borrower has been advised that ADB's approval of advance contracting will not commit ADB to subsequently \napprove the project or to finance the recruitment costs; and ADB will not finance expenditures paid by the \nborrower before loan effectiveness, even if advance contracting is approved, unless retroactive financing has \nalso been approved by ADB. The government requested ADB to conduct, on behalf of the government, the \nselection processes up until but not including negotiations for the project manager, procurement specialist, and \nproject accountant for the PMU; and the energy sector reform firm. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n23.  The beneficiaries will primarily be the domestic, industrial, agricultural, and commercial \nclients of public goods and services provided by PSEs, which will deliver improved services. \nTaxpayers and recipients of government services will indirectly benefit from the reduced fiscal \ncosts of PSEs. Workers in PSEs are expected to benefit from a consistent and fair approach to \nlabor retrenchment, which will be provided through the mitigation framework for labor-related \nmatters to be developed under the project. \nA.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The  PSE  reform  agenda  supported  by  the  project  is economically  viable  since the \nefficiency gains are expected to exceed the adjustment costs. The conclusions are supported by \nthe financial analysis. Successful privatization that reduces the fiscal drain of PSEs will benefit \ntaxpayers and the beneficiaries of public goods. The availability of higher-quality goods and \nservices provided by privatized companies are expected to compensate for tariff adjustments.22 \n                                                \n22 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management assessment showed that the Finance Division of the MOF \nand the Privatisation Commission have higher-quality internal control systems than most of the \nsystems in the government. However, these agencies do not fully meet international standards \nof governance. The Finance Division of the MOF has experienced control breaches, and many \ndocuments  are  maintained  only  on  paper. The  Privatisation  Commission  does not  have  a \nfinancial and accounting manual for implementation of the accounting procedure rules. These \nrules do not have a strong link with the Commission\u2019s internal control system. The Finance \nDivision of the MOF and the Privatisation Commission have a limited number of staff with the \nrequired financial management skills. However, with the proposed mitigating measures in place \n(para. 31), the financial management arrangements are adequate to implement the project. \n \n26.  The Finance Division of the MOF lacks procurement specialists who have experience \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The Privatisation Commission \npossesses  adequate  skills,  experience,  and  capacity  to  procure  consulting  services  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Basic concepts of procurement \nand practices being followed in the Privatisation Commission are largely consistent with ADB \nguidelines.23  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  including  the  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The  project  will  help  the  government  reduce  the  economic  and  fiscal  costs  that \nPakistan\u2019s PSEs are imposing on consumers, taxpayers, and beneficiaries of social services. \nThe project will maximize the benefits that private management and improved corporate and \nsector  governance  can  bring  to  PSE  economic  efficiency  and  financial  feasibility.  These \nchanges are expected to improve access to basic services such as electricity. The PSEs to be \nrestructured and privatized may decrease their demand for low-skilled labor. The project will \ndevelop a framework for labor issues, under which the government is expected to regularly \nconsult  labor  unions to  ensure that  workers\u2019  rights  are respected  during  restructuring  and \nprivatization. The poor are not expected to be affected by potential increases in tariffs to cost-\nrecovery  levels  (e.g.,  electricity  tariffs)  if,  as  planned,  existing  government  subsidies  are \nretargeted at low-income households. The customer surveys to be financed by the project will \nmonitor service delivery and tariff structures of PSEs throughout project implementation, with \nspecific consideration of poor consumers. The government, with ADB support, is strengthening \nits national social protection program, which already includes a targeting framework. \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The project will have no impact on the environment or on indigenous peoples, and does \nnot entail any involuntary resettlement. It is classified as category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n                                                \n23 An  assessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  of  the  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF  and  of  the  Privatisation \nCommission is available upon request. \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.24 Deterioration of the political and security situation in Pakistan may \naffect investor confidence, and vested interests and legal obstacles may disrupt the reform \nagenda. The government\u2019s PSE reform and privatization program may focus only on profitable \nPSEs, reducing potential efficiency gains. To mitigate these concerns, the project will develop (i) \na public communications plan to ensure transparency, raise public awareness and support for \nthe reforms, and manage expectations about the accessibility and services provided by PSEs; \nand (ii) a mitigation framework for labor issues. The ECC will oversee project implementation. \nBy helping the government lead the policy dialogue, the project will reduce the scope for vested \ninterests to disrupt the reform agenda. Policy-based lending (programmatic assistance) is being \nprepared (footnote 17) to provide incentives to restructure fiscally costly PSEs. \n \n31.  To ensure compliance with ADB policies and guidelines, assistance and oversight will be \nrequired at the project level to address the small number of staff and weak financial skills, \ninternal controls, cash management, and forecasting systems in the MOF\u2019s Finance Division \nand the Privatisation Commission. The PMU will engage full-time, qualified accountant and \nprocurement  specialists.  ADB  will  provide  the Finance  Division  with  updated  disbursement \nprojections  during  review  missions  to  help  plan  cash  requirements.  The  project  financial \nstatements will be audited by the Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan. The project\u2019s \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The  government  and  the  Privatisation  Commission  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n33.  The government and the Finance Division of the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.
