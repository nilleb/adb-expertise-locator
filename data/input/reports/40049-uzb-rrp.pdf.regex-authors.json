The Project \nwill  build  on  the  work  done  under  other  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)-funded  projects  such  as  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram (ESDP), the Information and Communications Technology in \nBasic  Education  Project  (ICTBEP)  and  the  Second  Textbook \nDevelopment Project (STDP). The Project has three components: (i) \nschool upgrading, (ii) teacher development, and (iii) the promotion of \ncommunity participation in school life. \n   \nRationale  The justification for funding basic education in rural areas rests on \ncurrent disparities in the provision of quality education services. Across \nthe  country,  schools  in  rural  communities  that  are  remote  from \nprovincial  and  district  centers  are  disadvantaged  in  almost  every \nrespect. A comprehensive school survey conducted in 2004 revealed \nclear  disparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools  in  terms  of  (i) \nfacilities; (ii) the allocation and quality of materials, teaching equipment, \nand furniture; and (iii) the allotment of teachers. \n \nAbout 80% of Uzbekistan\u2019s 9,773 basic schools are located in rural \nareas. The vast majority of rural basic schools are considered to be in \npoor condition, requiring emergency repairs and major rehabilitation \nworks. Common defects include leaking roofs, water infiltration to the \nbuilding  structures,  damaged  windows  and  doors,  defective  floors, \nmalfunctioning sanitary and plumbing facilities, broken heating systems, \nand leaking water supply systems. Most classroom furniture is also in \nvery poor condition. About 70% of schools have no science laboratory \nequipment and lack modern teaching aids and learning materials.  \n \nTeaching  techniques  and  subject  knowledge  of  many  teachers, \nparticularly  in  rural  schools,  are  inadequate  and  outdated.  Most \nteachers  still  apply  traditional  teaching  methods,  devoting  attention \ngenerally to narrow subject knowledge, requiring students to memorize \nand repeat notions and definitions. Critical thinking, problem solving, \ncommunication skills, and teamwork do not receive sufficient attention. \nAlthough training programs for teachers have been gradually revised, \nthe current in-service training system needs to become more flexible to ", "ii \nadjust  to  specific  subject-related  requirements  of  teachers  in  rural \nschools, who work in difficult circumstances. \nResponding  to  the  needs  highlighted  in  the  2004  survey,  the \nGovernment  launched  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education \nDevelopment  (NPBED)  2004\u20132009,  which  aims  to  strengthen  basic \neducation to meet international standards and remove disparities. The \ninvestment costs of the NPBED are estimated at $1.2 billion, to be \nfinanced  by  a  combination  of  75%  budget  financing,  20%  foreign \ninvestment  financing,  and  5%  local  voluntary  contributions.  Major \ninvestments  include  school  construction  and  rehabilitation,  and \nsignificant salary increases for teachers in order to provide them with \nadequate incentives. \n \nThe Government has asked ADB\u2019s support to supplement the NPBED \nand focus on improving the relevance and quality of basic education in \nrural areas in selected regions. Other ongoing ADB interventions in the \neducation sector provide country-wide assistance, under the NPBED \nframework,  in  addressing  issues  related  to  (i)  policy  planning, \ngovernance,  and  management;  (ii)  curriculum  modernization  and \ntextbook development; and (iii) improving teaching and learning through \ninformation and communication technology. \n \nADB\u2019s assistance to the education sector in Uzbekistan has evolved \nsince the mid-1990s to support the Government in different stages of \nreforming and strengthening the education system. Assistance included \nthe ongoing ESDP that was approved in December 2002 and consists \nof a program loan for $70 million and a project loan for $38.5 million. \nThe ESDP assisted in the establishment of a comprehensive policy \nreform framework with special focus on (i) modernizing the structure, \ncontent, and process of education; (ii) improving sector sustainability \nand  efficiency;  (iii)  reforming  governance  of  education;  and  (iv) \nproviding protection to the most vulnerable students. The STDP builds \non  the  achievement  of  the  successful  implementation  of  the  first \nTextbook Development Project (implemented between 1997 and 2004) \nand provides a $30.0 million loan to (i) modernize the curriculum and \nlearning assessment, (ii) improve textbook development and learning \nmaterials, and (iii) provide textbooks and improve school libraries. The \nICTBEP provides assistance for $30 million to improve the quality and \nrelevance  of,  and  access  to,  basic  education  through  integrating \ninformation and communication technology into teaching and learning. \nIn addition, ADB provides technical assistance to establish a center for \neffective management of investments and reforms in basic education to \nstrengthen coordination among projects and build capacity to improve \nthe monitoring, evaluation, and planning in the education sector. \n   \n ", "iii \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be improved opportunities for children \nfrom rural areas to progress to higher levels of education. The project \noutcome will be improved equitable access to, and enhanced quality \nand relevance of, basic education in rural areas in three project oblasts \n(provinces). The expected outcome will be achieved by (i) upgrading of \nschool  facilities,  (ii)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  teacher  training \ninstitutions  and  raion  (district)  education  departments  to  strengthen \nteaching in rural schools, and (iii) increasing community participation in \nschool life.  \n   \nInvestment Plan  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $43  million \nequivalent,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and \nduties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  30.00            70 \nGovernment of Uzbekistan   13.00            30 \n  Total  43.00          100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount   ADB will provide a loan in various currencies in special drawing rights \nequivalent  to  $30.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to \nfinance  70%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  remaining  $13.0 million \nequivalent (30%) will be provided by the Government.  \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011. \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Executing Agency (EA) will be the Ministry of Public Education \n(MOPE). \n   \nImplementation  MOPE, as the EA, will appoint the project director who will coordinate \nArrangements  the  overall  implementation  of  project  activities.  A  project  steering \ncommittee (PSC) will be established to provide strategic guidance and \nmonitor the implementation of the Project. The PSC will be chaired by \nthe  minister  of  MOPE  and  consist  of  eight  members  including \nrepresentatives of MOPE, the Ministry of Finance, and representatives \nfrom mahalla (a community-based body of citizen self-management) \ncommittees and oblast administrations of the three project regions.  \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  current  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  established  under  the  ESDP  (or  any \nsuccessor hereto acceptable to ADB) staffed by an additional six staff \nmembers, including a deputy project manager. Office space for the PIU \nwill be provided by MOPE. The PIU will report to the project director \nand provide quarterly progress reports to the PSC, MOPE, and ADB. \nThe PIU will work in close coordination with other ADB-funded projects, \nnamely, the STDP and ICTBEP. \n   \n ", "iv \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). A procurement plan has been prepared to guide \nactivities  during  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  provide \nlaboratory equipment, teaching aids, classroom furniture, and learning \nmaterials. Equipment and goods estimated to cost more than $500,000 \nwill be procured under international competitive bidding procedures. \nEquipment and materials estimated to cost $500,000 or less will be \nprocured under national competitive bidding on shopping procedures as \ndescribed in the procurement plan.  \n   \nConsulting Services  All  consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the procurement plan. Under the three project components, a \ntotal of 26 person-months of international consulting services and 85 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  contracted, \nfinanced by ADB funds. International and national consultants financed \nfrom ADB funds will be recruited as a firm under the quality and cost-\nbased  selection  method,  using  full  technical  proposals.  The \nGovernment has agreed to recruit the PIU in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  recruiting  individual  consultants.  Consulting  services \nunder the three components will include experts in the fields of teacher \ndevelopment  and  community  participation.  In  addition,  the  Project \nprovides funding for engaging national training providers and a national \nmedia firm.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Restructuring and modernizing the education system is a priority of the \nBeneficiaries  Government\u2019s development agenda. The Government is committed to \ninvesting $1.2 billion to strengthen the education system and remove \ndisparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools.  The  Project  will \ncomplement  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  create  equal  learning \nopportunities across the country and complement ADB assistance by \nexpanding benefits achieved under other projects to rural basic schools \nin selected regions. \n \nAbout 670,000 students and 63,000 teachers will benefit from upgraded \nschool facilities in the three project regions. In addition, by the end of \nthe project, it is assumed that at least 4,000 school board members and \nparents will have benefited from training initiatives under component 3. \nAbout 45,000 grade 5\u20139 teachers will benefit from new teacher training \nprograms.  Approximately  1,600  school  managers  will  benefit  from \ntraining  under  the  Project.  Further,  about  450  methodologists, \nadministrators, and teacher trainers will benefit from training programs \nunder components 2 and 3. Communities will benefit from upgraded \nschools,  with  active  school  boards  using  school  facilities  for  adult \nlearning  and  extra-curriculum  activities,  and  social  events.  The \nimproved ability of school management and school boards to raise \nadditional funds will increase revenue generation at the school level \nand reduce the dependence on public budget allocations for operation \nand maintenance (O&M) funds. The successful results of community \nparticipation will set the basis for countrywide replication and improved \ngovernance of the education sector. \n ", "v \n   \nRisks and  Successful implementation of the Project assumes that the Government \nAssumptions  will (i) maintain the budget allocation for basic education as indicated, \n(ii) be committed to modernizing the education system, (iii) provide \nadequate funding to finance in-service training as planned, and (iv) \nprovide sufficient funds, calculated at 2% of the investment cost, for \nO&M to upgraded schools.  \n \nAt present, MOPE\u2019s managerial and technical capacity is limited, and \nthis might affect the smooth implementation of reforming the education \nsystem.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  training  measures  for \nteachers and managers at rural schools, and capacity-building activities \nunder other ADB-financed projects. Promoting community participation \nand  adopting  a  participatory  and  transparent  approach  to  project \nimplementation, actively involving school directors, teachers, parents, \nand civil-society groups, will strengthen governance at the school level.  \n \nFinancial risks involve potential difficulties in the provision of recurrent \ncosts  for  O&M.  ADB  is  planning  to  conduct  a  study  on  education \nfinancing and assist the Government in increasing efficiency of the \neducation financing mechanism. During project implementation, ADB \nwill work closely with the Government to ensure adequate resource \nallocation for the education sector and incremental recurrent costs for \nO&M. Appropriate assurances are included in the project design. In \naddition,  the  Project\u2019s  strategy  aims  to  reduce  the  dependency  on \npublic allocations by promoting income generation at the school level.  \n \n ", "N N\n0' 0'\n0 0\no5   o9  \n4 3\nC\nKYRGYZREPUBLI Andijan ANDIJAN gana dan\ner or\nF J\nN h\nCT mangan MANGA Kokand A Suk\nE Na NA AN N\no69  00'E TAN ATION PROJ 150 N ChirchikTASHKENTAngren TASHKENTSyrdarya FERGRSYRDARYA.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Rural Basic Education Project (the Project). The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide  technical  assistance  to  assist  in  preparing  the  Project.1  In  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy, the Project is included in the country strategy and program \n2006\u20132010.2  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Socioeconomic Context \n \n3.  Uzbekistan has a relatively young and economically active population. Of the population \nof approximately 27 million in 2006, 47% were below the age of 20. The population growth rate \nis estimated at about 1.9%. About 63% of the population lives in rural and remote areas. The \neconomy has shown strong performance over the past 3 years. Real gross domestic product \n(GDP) grew 7.3% in 2006, following growth of 7.7% in 2004 and 7.0% in 2005, mainly due to \nmacroeconomic stability and increases in exports. Agriculture accounts for about 25% of GDP, \nwith cotton as the main agricultural export commodity. Industry contributes about 21%, trade \n9.2%, transport and communications 11.3%, construction 4.9%, and other sectors including \nservices about 29%.3 The Government has introduced major tax reforms, including reduction \nand simplification of rates. Despite lower corporate and personal income tax rates, revenues \nhave continued to grow. The Central Bank has kept inflation under control and maintained tight \ntargets for most monetary aggregates. Inflation in 2006 was reported to be 6.8%, compared with \n7.5% in 2005.4 \n \n4.  For 2007\u20132008, it is expected that rising investment and relatively strong exports will \nsupport further economic growth. GDP is projected to grow annually at 7% on average. In \nparticular, the hydrocarbons and telecommunications sectors will attract investments, as will \nsome manufacturing subsectors. It is further projected that an increase in Government spending \nwill support growth in domestic demand in 2007. Although imports of capital goods will rise due \nto the development of the hydrocarbons sector and the continued need of industries such as \nautomotives to import component parts, current controls on imports of consumer goods will \nsuppress the overall growth in import volumes. \n \n5.  As noted in the Asian Development Outlook 2007,5 external demand for exports of the \ncountry\u2019s commodities is expected to remain favorable, and the continued good economic \nperformance will provide an opportunity to push through the structural reforms Uzbekistan \nneeds to diversify its economic structure in order to ensure continued high growth rates that will \ncreate employment opportunities. In particular, more reforms are needed over the medium term \n                                            \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Preparing the Rural Basic Education Project. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Uzbekistan. Manila.  \n3  Information provided by the Ministry of Finance. \n4  The International Monetary Fund suggests that inflation rates are underestimated due to different sampling and \ncalculation methods applied. However, the difference between official and IMF estimates has been getting \nnarrower over the past years. \n5  ADB. 2007. Asian Development Outlook. Manila (pp. 128\u2013130). ", "2 \naddressing challenges related to (i) further reducing inflation; (ii) eliminating constraints to the \ndevelopment of the banking system; and (iii) easing barriers to foreign trade, including reducing \ntax and administrative costs. \n \n6.  The country\u2019s experience suggests that, given the narrow base of the economy and its \nvulnerability to external shocks, economic growth per se does not immediately translate into \npoverty reduction. Poverty incidence remains at around 29.8%,6 and rural poverty is deeply \nentrenched.  About  70%  of  poor  people  live  in  rural  areas.  Strengthening  the  quality  and \nrelevance of education services is thus perceived as an important intervention to (i) combat \npoverty,  particularly  in  rural  areas;  (ii)  widen  the  range  of  opportunities  for  employment \ngeneration; and (iii) promote competitiveness and private sector development.  \n \n2.  Education Sector \n \n7.  Basic education in Uzbekistan includes primary and secondary levels from grades 1\u20139. \nIn the school year 2006\u20132007, about 5.7 million students were enrolled in 9,773 basic education \nschools with a total of about 450,000 teachers. About 80% of basic schools are located in rural \nareas.  Approximately  50%  of  basic  education  enrolments  are  in  grades  1\u20134.  With  a  net \nenrolment  rate  estimated  at  over  99%  and  no  gender  differentials  in  primary  education, \nUzbekistan  scores  high  on  the  two  Millennium  Development  Goals  of  achieving  universal \nprimary  education  and  eliminating  gender  disparity  in  primary  and  secondary  education. \nAppendixes 2 and 3 present details of the Uzbek education sector.  \n \n8.  According  to  the  Constitution  of  Uzbekistan,  all  citizens  are  entitled  to  free  basic \neducation. In order to achieve this goal, and particularly to improve the access of poor people to \nincome generating opportunities, the Government has placed a high priority on restructuring and \nmodernizing the education system. Improving the quality of education services, particularly in \nrural  areas,  should  contribute  to  (i)  achieving  steady  economic  growth,  (ii)  creating  equal \nopportunities for all by removing disparities between rural and urban regions, and (iii) improving \nliving conditions in rural areas. \n \n9.  The Law on Education and the National Program on Personnel and Training (NPPT) are \nthe major policy documents describing the Government strategy for the education sector. The \nNPPT, which was launched in 1997, lays the foundation for reforming and strengthening the \neducation system. Fundamental policy reforms included (i) establishing a compulsory 12-year \neducation  system  by  increasing  senior  secondary  education  (SSE)  from  2  to  3  years,  (ii) \ninstitutional restructuring and rationalizing of the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) and the \nMinistry of Senior Secondary and Higher Education (MOSSHE), (iii) financial decentralization, \n(iv)  improving  public  governance  in  educational  establishments,  (v)  increasing  wages  for \nteachers and principals, and (vi) consolidating and modernizing the curriculum framework and \nrevising education standards and learning assessments. \n \n10.  In accordance with the NPPT, the Government made a decision in 2004 to extend the \nschooling period by 1 year and establish a nationwide 12-year education system gradually by \n2009. The reformed education system in Uzbekistan comprises (i) preschooling, (ii) primary \neducation of grades 1\u20134,  (iii) secondary education of grades 5\u20139, (iv) SSE of grades 10\u201312,7 \nand (v) higher education. After completion of basic education (grades 1\u20139), students will either \ncontinue with a 3-year SSE course at academic lyceums, or enroll in professional colleges, \n                                            \n6  World Bank. 2007. Uzbekistan Living Standard Assessment Report No. 25923-UZ. Washington, DC. \n7  Under the new education system to be established across the country by 2009, SSE was made compulsory and \nextended from 2 years (grades 10\u201311) to 3 years (grades 10\u201312). \n ", "3 \nwhich will provide a 3-year program combining a vocational specialty with general education. \nGraduates from academic lyceums and professional colleges earn diplomas, which allow them \nto  enroll  in  higher-education  institutions  or  engage  in  employment  in  the  field  of  their \nspecialization. \n \n11.  Once  the  new  12-year  education  system  is  established  nationwide  by  2009,  it  is \nestimated that about 1.6 million students will be enrolled in SSE institutions. To ensure that all \ngrade 9 graduates from basic education schools can enroll in the new 3-year SSE programs, \nadditional resources and classroom facilities are required by 2009. In order to provide adequate \nfacilities for the expected increased number of SSE students, the Government has allocated \nadditional funds to establish 176 academic lyceums and 1,691 professional colleges with 844 \nboarding facilities by 2009. Rehabilitation and construction works started in 2004. The number \nof SSE institutions has increased from 869 in 2004 to 1,055 in 2006. \n \n12.  While  basic  education  schools  are  administered  by  MOPE,  academic  lyceums  and \nprofessional  colleges  are  the  responsibility  of  MOSSHE.  MOPE  is  responsible  for  setting \neducation  policy  and  standards  in  general  education,  curriculum,  textbook  and  teacher \ndevelopment,  and  policy  and  program  implementation  through  oblast  (province)  and  raion \n(district) departments of education. In 2004, the Government restructured the functions and \ntasks of MOPE, MOSSHE, and their associated institutions at the national and the provincial \nlevels to make the system more responsive and relevant to the emerging requirements of \nUzbekistan. The structure of the education system is in Appendix 2; a description of school \nfacilities is in Appendix 3.  \n \n13.  Public expenditure for education has increased every year since 2000, and reached \n8.1% of GDP in 2006. The share of basic education in total education expenditure increased \nfrom 37% in 2000 to 56% in 2006, and is estimated to reach 58% in 2007. Appendix 4 describes \nthe education sector financing arrangements. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Key Issues and Challenges \n \n14.  Poor Educational Facilities. In 2004, a comprehensive school mapping survey8 was \ncarried out to review (i) school capacities; (ii) actual enrollments; (iii) the overall condition of \nschool  buildings  including  classrooms,  laboratory  and  library  rooms,  workshops,  and \ngymnasiums; (iv) the state of utilities and sanitary facilities; and (v) the quantity and condition of \nschool furniture and sports equipment.  The  survey  revealed  that  out of the 9,727 schools \ncovered by the study, more than 90% were in a poor condition requiring major rehabilitation and \nrepairs, and about 7% (684) were considered in very poor condition requiring emergency repairs. \nThe classroom capacity of schools was not in line with the growing number of students; about 1.7 \nmillion students (or 28%) were studying in 2\u20133 shift schools9. \n \n15.  The majority of schools were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s and have seriously \ndeteriorated  as  a  consequence  of  severe  weather  conditions,  continuous  use,  and  poor \nmaintenance due to years of underfunding since 1991independence. The deterioration of the \nschool facilities was further exacerbated by the poor construction technology and inferior quality \nof construction materials used. Common defects were leaking roofs, water infiltration to the \n                                            \n8  Government of Uzbekistan. 2004. School Mapping Survey. \n9 Shift schools offer schooling programs at different hours to accommodate the growing number of students.    \nTypically there could be 2-3 shifts: morning, afternoon and evening to accommodate schooling needs and number \nof hours. \n ", "4 \nbuilding  structures,  damaged  and  leaking  windows  and  doors,  defective  wooden  floors, \nmalfunctioning sanitary and plumbing facilities, broken heating systems, and leaking water \nsupply systems. Most classroom furniture was in very poor condition. About 71% of the schools \nhad no basic science laboratory equipment, and about 85% of the schools had no modern \ncomputers.  The  lack  of  adequate  teaching  aids  and  learning  materials  is  another  major \nconstraint to applying modern teaching methodologies. \n16.  Rural-Urban Divide. The survey also revealed great disparities between urban and rural \nschools in the quality of school facilities, the allotment of teachers, and the allocation and quality \nof materials, teaching equipment, and furniture. Urban schools are better equipped in almost \nevery respect.  \n \n17.  Lack of Adequate Upgrading of Teaching Skills and Techniques. With over 450,000 \nteachers (more than 330,000 of whom serve in rural schools), the Uzbek education system \nneeds  to  be  constantly  improving  itself.  However,  the  teaching  techniques  and  subject \nknowledge of many teachers are inadequate and outdated and need to be upgraded and \naligned with the revised curriculum. The lack of teachers\u2019 professional competence to promote \nactive engagement by students is a serious issue that hampers improvement of education \nquality. Teachers also need assistance to integrate new laboratory equipment into teaching \npractice so that practical experiments are conducted. Providing support to teachers and building \na monitoring mechanism is required to ensure that new equipment is utilized and integrated into \nthe curriculum.  \n \n18.  Although training programs for teachers were revised by MOPE in 2005, the current in-\nservice  training  system  needs  to  be  more  flexible  to  adjust  to  specific  subject-related \nrequirements of teachers in rural schools, who work in difficult circumstances. At present, the \nmajority  of  in-service  training  curricula  for  all  subject  areas  is  developed  by  the  Central \nRepublican In-Service Teacher Training Institute (TTI). Based on these curricula, the provincial \nTTIs develop training courses for teachers. Under the existing in-service system, teachers are \nrequired to participate in a 24-day training every 3 years, which combines residential training at \nthe respective provincial TTI, followed by practice activities at their home school.10  \n \n19.  However, feedback from teachers indicates that most in-service training modules as \ncurrently  drafted  are  too  general  in  nature,  too  theoretical  in  orientation,  and  insufficiently \ngrounded in the practical conditions teachers have to cope with, particularly in rural schools.11 \nThere is also a need to improve instructional design process standards because (i) statements \nof goals and objectives often do not provide sufficient specific information; (ii) new teaching \nmethodologies  to  be  introduced  should  be  explained  through  constant  references  to,  and \nexamples from, the subject areas to be taught; and (iii) the language and format of training \nmodules need to be simplified so that they can be understood easily by both trainers and \nteachers. Guidance provided to teachers during their practice activities at their home schools is \n                                            \n10  In-service training for newly assigned teachers consist of 18 days residential training followed by 6 days practice at \ntheir home schools; in-service training for other teachers consists of 12 days residential training followed by 12 \ndays practice at their home schools. Under the ADB-funded ICTBEP, the concept of cluster leader school has been \nintroduced. Each cluster leader school links a cluster of 10 schools, and will become the center for training of the \ncluster, bringing training opportunities closer to teachers in remote and rural areas, and hence helping to \ndecentralize training opportunities. While the cluster leader school concept has been developed to first provide \ntraining for the use of ICT, each cluster leader school could be used as a service center, and hence become a \ntraining center for the cluster, bringing together teachers from different schools and enhancing knowledge sharing \nand capacity-building opportunities. \n11  In the absence of a systematic needs assessment, the project preparatory technical assistance gathered possible \ninformation on teacher training needs through focus-group discussions with teachers, teacher trainers, school \nprincipals, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) at the oblast and raion level. \n ", "5 \nweak. Due to the lack of a monitoring mechanism, no feedback is available to assess whether \nnew teaching methods and knowledge are applied in the classroom after the completion of in-\nservice training. \n \n20.  Lack  of  Modern  Teaching  Tools.  Textbooks  continue  to  dominate  the  teaching-\nlearning materials in the classroom. There is recognition that the range of teaching-learning \nmaterials needs to be broadened, and that teachers should be encouraged to (i) develop and \nprovide textbook-related additional materials,12 (ii) use standard ICT applications to produce \nindividual, context-related learning and teaching materials, and (iii) practice student-centered \nlearning arrangements shifting the teacher\u2019s roles from knowledge transfer to moderation of the \nknowledge  acquisition  and  information  exchange  processes.  The  integration  between \ncurriculum revision, teacher training, and textbook development also needs to be strengthened. \n \n21.  Need for Curriculum Development. The current curriculum is overloaded with subjects \nand content requirements with insufficient emphasis on modern learning methodologies, and \nthese are no longer consistent with the principles of flexibility in subject selection and a student-\ncentered  teaching  environment.  MOPE  has  started  the  process  of  revising  the  curriculum \nframework.  A  committee  has  been  established  to  review  curriculum  modules  and  prepare \nstrategies  for  consolidation.  Education  standards  and  textbooks  for  grades  1\u20139  are  being \nrevised accordingly. School exams are being amended according to uniform national standards, \nwhich provide a good basis to monitor learning achievements nationwide. The ADB-funded \nSecond Textbook Development Project (STDP)13 provides assistance to reform the curriculum \nframework, align education standards, and strengthen textbook development. These efforts will \nsupport the introduction of a mandatory 12-year education system by 2009. \n \n22.  In 1998, the Government changed the curriculum from Cyrillic script to Latin script. \nTextbooks have been transformed for all major subjects, and ADB has assisted the Government \nwith two projects focusing on the provision of textbooks14. However, to build up literacy skills of \nstudents in early grades, additional reading materials are needed, particularly in rural schools \nwhere newspapers, bookshops, and other reading resources are limited. School libraries are \nused beyond school-related activities. Especially in rural areas, schools are knowledge centers \nfor children and communities, and hence will be provided with adequate material. Access to \nknowledge is an important factor in providing more opportunities for rural and poor areas.   \n \n23.  Need for Stronger Community Participation. During the Soviet period, parents largely \nleft school education to teachers, as funding of school facilities was sufficient and the quality of \neducation in schools was considered satisfactory; hence there was little need for additional \nparental and community involvement in school affairs. However, at present, due to deteriorating \nschool facilities and insufficient funding to cover basic operational and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts, school managements frequently appeal to parents and communities to provide aid for \nurgent  school  needs.  In  addition,  schools  have  begun  to  face  new  issues  of  student \n                                            \n12 For example, exercises, teacher guides, different methodical approaches, best-practice examples from other \nteachers, and contests. \n13 ADB. 2004.

At the commencement of each school year, families need to meet new costs including \nschool uniforms, textbook rentals, stationery, and informal payments for tutorials.  \n \n24.  Schools where parents, teachers, and community members are actively engaged in \nproviding  support  are  better  maintained  than  schools  with  low  community  participation. \nCommunity participation in school life can also open up opportunities for the community itself. \nThe majority of villages lack venues for learning and recreation activities for adults and children. \nThus,  more  and  more  communities  are  exploring  possibilities  to  utilize  school  facilities  as \nknowledge  centers  and  community  focal  points  for  organizing  social  events,  sports  and \nrecreation  activities,  training,  and  information  programs  for  young  and  adult  community \nmembers. Increasing community participation in school life would lead to better services to the \ncommunity itself, enhanced opportunities, and increased efficiency of investments in school \nequipment and facilities.16 \n \n25.  The Government encourages community participation in education to improve the quality \nof education and strengthen governance and accountability in schools. The legal framework for \ncommunity participation is provided in (i) the NPPT, (ii) the Law on Education, and (iii) the \nRegulation on General Education. All documents promote the establishment of school boards \nand parental committees to increase public governance and ensure greater transparency in \ndecision-making processes in schools. In support of the legal framework, MOPE developed the \npartnership concept of Family-Mahalla-School,17 which broadly defines roles and responsibilities \nof parents and other community stakeholders to support the education process at the school \nlevel.  In  view  of  limited  public  funds  for  repair  and  maintenance  of  facilities,  MOPE  also \nencourages schools to generate revenues to reduce dependency on public allocations. The \nauthority to manage these revenues has been delegated to school boards.18 \n \n26.  Although  the  legal  framework  encourages  community  participation,  the  status  and \nmandates  of  school  boards  and  parental  committees  are  not  clearly  defined  in  the  policy \ndocuments, and it is hence left to the goodwill of the community and its members to participate \nin school life and benefit from the schools becoming knowledge and community life centers. So \nfar  about  65%  of  all  basic  schools  have  established  school  boards.  However,  field  visits \nrevealed  that  existing  school  boards,  particularly  in  rural  schools,  lack  experience  and \nknowledge to be actively involved in school affairs, and have weak capacity to develop school \nimprovement plans, identify income generating activities, and raise funds. Lack of monitoring \nmechanisms to review education quality, teacher performance and learning achievements, and \ntransparent mechanisms to monitor off-budget funds, are issues raised by community members \nand  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  during  the  field  visits.  More  information  on \ncommunity participation in basic education is in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n                                            \n15 Surveys by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded education project and \nfeedback from communities, parents, and students during field visits revealed increasing absenteeism in schools.     \n16 ADB is planning to conduct a study on education financing, including a survey of parental contribution to education. \nThe data collected will be used as the basis for suggesting new mechanisms for education financing to increase \nthe efficiency of the sector and strengthen its governance. \n17 Mahallas are village councils. \n18 Typical revenue generating activities include: selling produce from fruit and vegetable school-gardens, fees for \ninformation and training courses for adults and youth, renting facilities for community activities, and organizing \nhobby clubs.  \n ", "7 \n2.  Government Policy and Strategy in the Education Sector \n \n27.  In response to the findings of the 2004 education sector survey (see para. 14), the \nGovernment launched the National Program for Basic Education Development (NPBED) 2004\u2013\n2009, which aims to strengthen basic education to meet international standards and remove \ndisparities  between  rural  and  urban  schools,  thereby  creating  equal  opportunities  for  all \nstudents. The NPBED promotes reforms in the basic education system by (i) providing financial \nsupport to improve the physical school conditions through construction and rehabilitation of \nbuildings and facilities; (ii) equipping all basic schools with new laboratories, modern computer \nrooms, and adequate furniture and teaching aids; (iii) providing free textbooks and educational \nmaterials to teachers; (iv) improving education standards; (v) reviewing and modernizing the \ncurriculum framework; (vi) ensuring that rural areas are provided with highly qualified teaching \nstaff;  (vii)  introducing  new  student-centered  teaching  approaches;  (viii)  increasing  teacher \nincentives; and (ix) developing sports activities in all basic schools.  \n \n28.  The investment costs of the NPBED, which are estimated at $1.2 billion, are being \nfinanced by a combination of 75% budget financing, 20% foreign investment financing, and 5% \nlocal voluntary contributions. By 2009, at least 8,476 schools should be covered under the \nNPBED, and this includes almost 87% of all basic schools in the country. The NPBED also \nprovides  funds  for  establishing  incentive  schemes  to  motivate  and  award  high-performing \nteachers  and  directors,  improve  in-service  teacher  training,  and  strengthen  curriculum \ndevelopment and learning assessments.  \n \n29.  In  order  to  implement  the  NPBED,  the  Government  has  established  the  School \nDevelopment Fund (SDF). The SDF is financed by a 1% tax on enterprise revenues and by in-\nkind  contributions  from  donors,  local  sponsors,  and  local  government.  Although  under  the \nprogram many schools have been successfully rehabilitated, the Government capacities do not \nfully  meet  the  demands  to  provide  newly  rehabilitated  schools  with  necessary  classroom \nfurniture, upgraded laboratory equipment, and teaching aids nationwide. Thus, the Government \nwill  partially  depend  on  external  assistance  to  successfully  complete  the  ambitious  reform \nprogram. \n \n30.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  continued  strong  commitment  to  reform  of  the \neducation sector, completing the transition of Uzbekistan\u2019s education system from the Soviet \nmodel to a system that is consistent with internationally accepted requirements. Fundamental \npolicy reforms in restructuring and modernizing the education sector have been adopted to (i) \nintroduce a new curriculum, (ii) develop new textbooks and learning materials, (iii) introduce \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) in schools, and (iv) sustain a new approach to \nteacher training. The Government is beginning to achieve successful results under various \nADB-supported activities. However, a major constraint in providing quality education services for \nall students countrywide is completing the rehabilitation and upgrading program under the \nNPBED, in order to provide all schools with adequate equipment and materials to sustain new \neducation  programs  and  meet  student  needs.  While  it  has  started  equipping  schools  with \nmodern facilities, and international donors are providing assistance, there is still a significant \nshortfall.  \n ", "8 \n31.  Addressing the issue of poor school facilities, 8,476 schools have been selected to be \nupgraded under the NPBED by 2009.19 Although rehabilitation works are progressing well, and \nGovernment data indicates that 3,441 schools had been rehabilitated by 2006, field visits to \nrural schools revealed that, depending on the funding allocation for each school, rehabilitation \nworks often could only address selected priorities. While rehabilitation of school buildings is \nproceeding  at  a  fast  rate,  in  many  schools  additional  resources  are  required  to  provide \nlaboratory equipment, furniture, teaching aids, and reading materials. ADB financing under the \nproposed Project will help the Government to further upgrade rural schools covered by the \nNPBED in three selected regions, and will provide support for integration of laboratory practice \nin teaching for increased quality of education. School visits revealed three main areas to be \nimproved, in addition to the lack of equipment for laboratories in rural schools, which remains a \npriority  and  the  most  expensive  investment.  The  three  areas  are  (i)  the  need  for  library \nmaterials,  (ii)  teaching  practices  and  training,  and  (iii)  community  participation.  Adopting \nmeasures  to  address  the  three  areas  will  ensure  successful implementation  of  the  reform \nprogram  under  the  NPBED  and  an  efficient  use  of  equipment  provided  to  schools,  which \nremains the priority investment need of the country. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n32.  Basic education is a key area of ADB assistance to Uzbekistan, and ADB is the lead \nexternal development partner in basic education. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update \n(2006\u20132008)20 highlights the importance of reducing poverty by promoting private-sector led \neconomic  growth  and  human  resource  development,  which  includes  promoting  general \neducation. \n \n33.  ADB assistance to the education sector in Uzbekistan has evolved since 1997 to support \nthe  Government  in  different  stages  of  reforming  and  strengthening  the  education  system. \nAssistance includes support for the establishment of a comprehensive policy reform framework \nand reform the education system with special focus on (i) modernizing the structure, content, \nand  process  of  education;  (ii)  improving  sector  sustainability  and  efficiency;  (iii)  reforming \ngovernance of education; and (iv) providing protection to vulnerable students21. In addition ADB \nis providing assistance to (i) modernize the curriculum and learning assessment, (ii) improve \ntextbook development and learning materials, and (iii) provide textbooks and establish libraries \nin selected schools22. Finally ADB is supporting the Government to improve the quality and \nrelevance of, and access to, basic education through integrating ICT in teaching and learning23. \nIn addition, ADB is currently supporting the establishment of a center for effective management \nof  investments  and  reforms  in  basic  education24  that  will  contribute  to  strengthening  the \ncoordination among projects and build the capacity to improve monitoring, evaluation, and \nplanning in the education sector. The proposed new Project will build on lessons learned from \n                                            \n19 The remaining schools were built in the 1990s and hence are considered new. However, they will be already \nalmost 20 years old once the NPBED comes to an end in 2009. Continuous support to school upgrading and \nmaintenance will be a future challenge for Uzbekistan.  \n20 Refer to footnote number 2. \n21 ADB. 2002.

In line with the NPBED, the Project will provide funding to help the \nGovernment  to  successfully  implement  the  school  rehabilitation  program  in  three  selected \nregions. The Project will complement ADB-funded activities by focusing on investment needs in \nrural schools, which have not been addressed by previous interventions, and by enhancing \noutputs  of  other  ADB-funded  projects  by  extending  materials  developed  under  the  ESDP, \nSTDP, and ICTBEP.  \n \n34.  While additional funds will be necessary to achieve all outputs under the NPBED, the \nproposed Project will support the Government in completing the reform effort in the three \nselected regions, while other donors will target remaining regions in the next few years. To \naddress  the  issue  of  inequality  in  the  provision  of  education  services  in  rural  areas,  it  is \nproposed that the new ADB intervention will complement the Government\u2019s NPBED and focus \non a priority area for improving the quality of basic education, this being the provision of \nlaboratory equipment and library material with special focus on three selected regions. The \nproposed Project will support improvements in learning and teaching environments in selected \nrural schools in (i) Tashkent oblast, (ii) Surkandarya, and (iii) Kashkadarya. It will complement \nother ongoing ADB interventions in the education sector which already provide assistance at \ncountry level in addressing issues related to (i) policy planning, governance, and management; \n(ii)  curriculum  modernization  and  textbook  development;  and  (iii)  improving  teaching  and \nlearning through ICT. To supplement these interventions, the World Bank financed education \nproject25 includes support to address issues related to education financing and provision of \nteaching aids in eight regions of the country, including Kashkadarya and Surkandarya which are \nincluded in the proposed Project. In addition, ADB is currently undertaking a comprehensive \nsector analysis to assess strategic areas for further assistance to increase the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the education system. \n \n4.  Lessons \n \n35.  The proposed project design takes into consideration experience gained and lessons \nlearned in implementing the ESDP, the ongoing STDP, and the ICTBEP. Some of the previous \nADB projects in Uzbekistan tended to be overambitious, with a large number of components \nand subcomponents and complex implementation arrangements. Due to the limited capacity in \nthe education sector, this complicated the project implementation. The proposed Project will be \nimplemented  by  one  executing  agency  and  focus  primarily  on  school  upgrading,  teacher \ndevelopment,  and  community  participation  in  three  regions  in  order  to  complement  and \nstrengthen ongoing Government initiatives and complete the efforts under the NPBED in these \nareas. The Project will be facilitated by the current project implementation unit (PIU) established \nunder  the  ESDP  and  is  experienced  in  procurement-related  matters,  including  identifying \ntechnical specifications and preparing tender documents. The proposed Project will benefit from \nthe technical experience in school upgrading gained under the NPBED. The selection criteria for \nschools to be included in the proposed Project will include indicators to increase community \nparticipation, and will support schools with active school boards and parental committees. \n \n36.  The ESDP and ICTBEP have developed strategies for using ICT and distance education \nmethods  to  improve  teacher  training.  The  proposed  Project  will  benefit  from  established \nmechanisms and lessons learned that will help to strengthen teacher development in rural \nschools. Further lessons relate to the need to ensure that (i) adequate O&M budgets and \npreventive maintenance of rehabilitated school facilities are provided, and (ii) the necessary \ninfrastructure is in place prior to the provision of modern teaching and learning equipment.  \n                                            \n25 World Bank. 2006. Basic Education Phase 1. Washington, DC (approved on 26 October, for $15 million). \n ", "10 \n5.  External Assistance to the Sector  \n \n37.  ADB has been the lead development partner in the education sector in Uzbekistan since \nthe mid-1990s. Complementing ADB\u2019s support to the education sector, in 2006 the World Bank \nprovided assistance to improve learning conditions in preschools and strengthening education \nquality in primary education in seven selected regions. The World Bank project operates in \nseven provinces and includes (i) increasing the availability of teaching and learning materials in \n1,500 preschools and general schools, (ii) enhancing the capacity of teacher training institutions \nto strengthen teaching techniques of grade 1\u20134 teachers, (iii) increasing community involvement \nin schools, (iv) creating conditions for funding schools on a per capita basis, and (v) building \nmanagerial capacity in MOPE. Depending on the achievements, a second phase might be \ninitiated, providing a new loan of $25 million. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are monitoring \nlearning  achievements  in  basic  education.26  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID) supported teacher development, school management, and community \nparticipation in about 100 schools, and piloted ICT use in 60 schools. USAID\u2019s projects have \nbeen  completed.  Some  bilateral  partners,  such  as  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  and \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) all provide support in vocational and higher education. The \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China provided a loan of $19 million to Uzbekistan in support of ICT in \nbasic education. The Government of Korea provided computers to selected schools to support \nICT in education. Inputs by these agencies have been relatively modest in financial terms. A \ndevelopment coordination matrix is in Appendix 13. The proposed Project complements these \ninitiatives in two key respects. First, it addresses the severe school infrastructure and learning \nconstraints in rural basic schools. In that sense, it will be targeted to increase access to quality \neducation in rural areas. Second, it provides an innovative approach to community participation \nand integrating teacher training efforts under other ADB-funded activities. \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n38.  The impact of the Project will be improved opportunities for children in rural areas to \nprogress to higher levels of education. The expected project outcome is more equitable access \nto, and improved quality and relevance of, basic education in rural areas in three project oblasts. \nGiven the well-established link between improved quality of education and poverty reduction, \nthe  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  through  the  improved  quality  of  education  in \nUzbekistan, where an estimated 70% of the poor live in rural areas. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n39.  The Project consists of three closely related components aiming at improving learning \nand teaching environments in rural schools. The first component focuses on upgrading selected \nrural schools through the provision of laboratory equipment, teaching aids, classroom furniture, \nand reading material. The second component aims at improving the quality of teaching in \nschools  by  upgrading  teaching  skills  and  competencies  of  teachers.  The  third  component \nfocuses on improving the school environment by strengthening community participation, for \nincreased efficiency in school governance. MOPE has selected three oblasts as the target areas \nfor this Project: (i) Tashkent oblast, (ii) Surkhandarya, and (iii) Kashkadarya. The selection has \nbeen based both on poverty and education quality indicators, as well as assessment estimating \n                                            \n26 Results published in 2006 confirmed that learning achievements have been improved through the reform efforts \nand are being considered generally satisfactory. \n ", "11 \nthe financial requirements to complete the upgrading of schools in the three areas. While \nKashkadarya and Surkandarya are among the poorest regions of the country, Tashkent oblast, \ndespite having a lower incidence of poverty, has higher disparities between urban and rural \nareas and deteriorating education quality. The project will hence benefit all regions by targeting \nrural and remote schools and thereby enhancing quality of education. A description of the \nproject oblasts is in Appendix 6. \n \n1.  Component 1: Upgrading Rural Schools  \n \n40.  In support of the NPBED, the Project will complement Government efforts to upgrade \nfacilities of rural basic education schools. While the Government will finance civil works to \nrehabilitate  and  construct  schools  under  the  NPBED,  ADB  financing  will  be  used  for  the \nprovision of (i) modern science laboratory equipment, laboratory furniture, and teaching aids for \nbiology, chemistry, and physics; (ii) classroom furniture; (iii) general teaching aids, and (iv) \nreading materials and basic furniture for libraries in at least 700 schools in the three project \nprovinces, to complete Government efforts in the Project region. The Project will also provide \nadditional funding for installation works, water piping, and electrical line connections within the \nlaboratory rooms to ensure that the laboratories will be functional after the installation of the \nequipment. A description of laboratory needs is in Appendix 6. \n \n41.  Only  newly  constructed  schools  and  schools  which  have  been  comprehensively \nrehabilitated under the NPBED will be considered for ADB financing under this component. \nMOPE  will  ensure  that  science  laboratory  and  library  rooms  at  schools  are  suitable  to \naccommodate equipment and materials to be provided under the Project. Based on the school \nmapping  survey  and  on  rehabilitation  plans  to  be  financed  under  the  NPBED,  MOPE  will \nprepare a preliminary list of schools which have been fully rehabilitated and newly constructed \nin the three project provinces. A list of criteria for selection of schools and steps for selection is \ndescribed in Appendix 7. \n \n42.  The final selection of schools for ADB support will be carried out on a competitive basis \nto foster community participation in school life and ensure that equipment and materials to be \nprovided to the schools will be effectively and efficiently utilized. Principals of schools which \nhave been fully rehabilitated and listed on a preliminary basis by MOPE for ADB support will be \ninvited to prepare a school improvement plan in close cooperation with school boards and \nparental committees. A format of school improvement plan will be prepared by the PIU in \ncooperation  with  experts  of  MOPE  and  be  provided  to  schools  for  guidance.  The  school \nimprovement  plan  will  provide  information  on  (i)  community  participation  in  school  life;  (ii) \ninventory  indicating  quantity  and  current  condition  of  biology,  chemistry,  and  physics \nlaboratories, teaching-aids, furniture, supplies, and consumables; (iii) the availability of teachers \nand  laboratory  assistants  for  each  science  subject  and  their  qualifications;  (iv)  plans  for \nintegration  of  laboratory  practice  into  the  curriculum;  (v)  the  method  for  monitoring  that \nequipment  is  integrated  into  the  teaching  process;  (vi)  sufficient  funding  for  O&M  of  the \nequipment and provision of consumables; (vii) planned after-school activities; (viii) planned \nfundraising activities and estimated revenues or in-kind assistance to support the O&M of \nscience laboratory rooms and equipment; and (ix) a plan to encourage students, teachers, and \ncommunity members to maximize the use of reading materials to be provided to the library.  \n \n43.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, MOPE will establish a selection committee at \neach  project  province  to  ensure  (i)  transparency  of  the  selection  process,  (ii)  proper \ncommunication with eligible schools, and (iii) that improvement plans received from schools are \nproperly evaluated. The terms of reference for the selection committee are in Appendix 7. Each \ncommittee  will  consist  of  five  members,  including  one  representative  from  the  oblast \n ", "12 \nadministration, two representatives from raion administrations, and two representatives from \ncivil society organizations. During the project implementation period, the committees will meet at \nthe beginning of each calendar year to prioritize schools for upgrading for each year. The key \ncriterion for inclusion in the Project will be (i) evidence of active community participation, (ii) \nphysical readiness of school facilities to install new laboratory equipment and establish libraries, \n(iii) sufficient funding for O&M costs, (iv) clear programs showing integration of laboratory \npractice in the curriculum, and (v) a list of material and funds received under other projects \nsince 2003. The priority lists will be submitted to MOPE for a final decision. The final selection of \nschools, and equipment and furniture packages for each school, will be submitted by MOPE to \nADB for concurrence.   \n  \n44.  The  utilization  of  laboratory  equipment  will  be  jointly  monitored  by  MOPE,  raion \neducation administrators, and the PIU. MOPE will provide ADB with quarterly monitoring reports \nconfirming that the new equipment is integrated into lesson plans and used by students and \nteachers. The Project will provide funds to engage a domestic consultant to support monitoring \nactivities and verify that the new equipment is fully utilized.  \n  \n45.  In order to further promote functional literacy of students in early grades and improve \nreading comprehension, knowledge, and language learning, the Project will complement the \nongoing STDP by supporting the establishment of school libraries and provide a package of \nreading and reference materials and library furniture. Within 2 months of loan effectiveness, \nMOPE will organize a committee that will determine the list of published reading materials to be \nprocured under the Project and in coordination with actions under the STDP. MOPE will submit \na list of committee members to ADB for concurrence. Under component 2, the Project will help \nteachers to improve teaching techniques and lesson planning, ensuring that the new equipment \nand reading materials are actively utilized by students in the learning process. \n   \n2.  Component 2: Teacher Development  \n \n46.  This component will address the inflexibility of the current in-service teacher training \nsystem which is not adequately focused on the specific subject-related needs of teachers in \nrural  schools.  The  objective  of  this  component  is  to  further  enhance  the  professional \ncompetence of grade 5\u20139 teachers working at schools supported by the Project. This will be \ndone by (i) strengthening the ability and expertise in the respective three provincial TTIs to \nprepare  and  deliver  needs-based  teacher-training  modules  which  foster  curriculum-relevant \nstudent-centered lessons and learning activities for specific subject groups; and (ii) developing \ncapacities of raion education departments to (a) provide regular guidance to teachers, (b) \nfacilitate information exchange among teachers and TTIs, and (c) monitor and support the \nprogress in improving teaching techniques in the classroom. After the new teacher training \ncourses  are  successfully  established  in  the  three  project  provinces,  the  new  approach  to \ndevelop and conduct needs based teacher training programs will be replicated in all other \nprovincial TTIs and integrated in the current national in-service teacher training system. \n \n47.  The  component  will  help  to  (i)  increase  the  access  to,  and  frequency  of,  training \nopportunities for teachers in rural schools; and (ii) make the current in-service teacher training \nsystem more responsive and focused on the specific needs of teachers in rural schools, who \nare working under difficult conditions due to a lack of appropriate teaching aids and materials.  \n \n48.  The Project will provide for the training of 84 teacher trainers from the respective TTIs \n(two trainers per each subject group) and 300 methodologists from raion education departments \non (i) strategies to promote continuing professional teacher development, (ii) approaches to \nidentify specific subject-related needs of teachers, (iii) student-centered learning and teaching \n ", "13 \nmethods which focus on the development of competencies and higher-order thinking skills \nacross all curriculum subjects for grades 5\u20139, and (iv) the means to integrate into lessons the \nuse of new equipment to be provided by the Project.  \n \n49.  Based on joint needs assessments for each subject group, training modules will be \ndeveloped by expert groups consisting of training curriculum development specialists from the \nTTIs  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants  financed  by  the  Project.  Selected  teachers  and \nmethodologists  from  the  raion  education  departments  will  be  closely  involved  in  the \ndevelopment process. The new teacher training programs will be subject-specific and consist of \nshort needs-based training modules that include individual tasks and teamwork activities to be \norganized in the home schools of teachers. Teachers will receive regular guidance from teacher \ntrainers and raion methodologists. TTI trainers, in close cooperation with raion methodologists, \nwill organize workshops at schools to demonstrate exemplary new training modules and provide \nsupport to organize informal learning activities within and among schools. To enhance the \nexchange  of  information  and  experiences  among  teachers,  achievements  in  applying  new \nteaching approaches will be jointly reviewed in follow-up workshops organized by TTIs and \nraion education departments. In addition to existing in-service teacher training conducted at the \nTTIs,  trained  teacher  trainers  will  regularly  conduct  short,  needs-based  training  courses \ndeveloped under the Project at selected schools. Moreover, 300 trained raion methodologists \nwill provide regular guidance to teachers at their home schools. Bringing the training down to \nthe school level will increase the access to training opportunities for teachers in remote rural \nareas.  \n \n50.  As far as possible, the use of ICT should be integrated into new training approaches, \nthus improving the development of learning materials and teaching aids. In designing teacher \ntraining programs and establishing a flexible mechanism to deliver training to schools, the \nProject will take into account (i) relevant distance education modules developed under the \nESDP,  (ii)  training  approaches  to  improve  teaching  and  learning  of  particular  subjects \ndeveloped under the ICTBEP, and (iii) innovative approaches to use teaching materials at the \nlocal learning resource centers established by the STDP. \n \n51.  The Project will provide consultant support and funding to organize training workshops to \nenable methodologists from the raion education departments within the Project regions to (i) \nprovide regular advice to teachers, (ii) facilitate information sharing, (iii) monitor improvements \nin applying student-centered teaching techniques, and (iv) monitor whether new laboratory \nequipment and teaching aids supplied under the Project are appropriately utilized by teachers \nand students. \n \n52.  At  the  national  level,  the  Project  will  organize  workshops  to  develop  a  general \nunderstanding among relevant stakeholders from MOPE, Cabinet of Ministers, the central TTI, \nprovincial TTIs, and district education administrations on (i) strategies to further improve and \ncomplement the current in-service teacher training, (ii) capacity-building needs for strengthening \nmodern teacher development strategies, and (iii) identifying strategies to integrate new short \nneeds-based training modules into the current in-service training curricula.  \n \n53.  In order to validate that teachers trained under the Project are applying student-centered \nteaching  methods  and  utilizing  new  equipment  (which  subsequently  should  lead  to  better \nlearning achievements of students) the Project will provide funding to implement a benchmark \nsurvey. At the beginning of the Project, a local firm specializing in social studies will carry out a \nbaseline study to establish indicators against which to assess the impact of the Project on \nlearning outputs and teaching environments. The international consultants engaged under the \nProject will provide support in analyzing the results. To compare results, the baseline study will \n ", "14 \nidentify sample schools supported by the Project and sample schools that will not receive \nassistance from any donor-supported project. The monitoring exercise will be conducted on an \nannual basis starting at the end the second year of implementation. An assessment system to \nreview  teacher  training  programs  conducted by  TTI  will  be  developed  by  the  international \nconsultant. The feedback will be used to revise training modules accordingly.   \n \n3.  Component 3: Community Participation \n \n54.  In support of the national Family-Community-School partnership concept, the proposed \nProject will assist MOPE in promoting community participation in school affairs through (i) the \nestablishment of school boards at all schools supported under the Project and assistance to \nstrengthen already existing school boards in schools in the three project provinces, (ii) the \ndevelopment of a training program for raion education offices and TTIs to promote community \nparticipation in school life, and (iii) raising public awareness on the benefits of quality education \nand community participation in school life. \n \n55.  At the school level, the Project will assist MOPE to organize training programs for school \nboard members, school managements, and raion education officers on planning, implementing, \nand monitoring of school improvement initiatives such as (i) fundraising; (ii) maintenance and \nimprovement  of  education  facilities;  (iii)  organizing  social  events,  recreation  activities,  and \neducational  programs  for  adult  and  youth  community  members;  (iv)  arrangement  of \nextracurricular activities for school children; and (v) support measures for low-income families. \n \n56.  The  training  program  for  school  boards  will  benefit  from  successful  experiences \ndeveloped  under  other  donor-supported  projects27  and  NGOs,  and  will  build  on  those  to \nmaximize benefits and avoid duplications. The Project will provide funding for international and \nnational consultants to (i) prepare training packages, and (ii) train a group of qualified core \ntrainers selected from NGOs and within the education system, who in turn will conduct training \nfor  school  board  members,  school  principals,  and  administrators  from  raion  and  oblast \neducation offices. The training will be conducted at selected schools in the project provinces. \nThe  Project  will  provide  funding  for  engaging  national  training  providers  and/or  NGOs  to \nfacilitate the training programs in coordination with core trainers.  \n \n57.  In order to strengthen the competency of oblast and raion education offices and TTIs to \nfurther stimulate parent participation and community engagement in school life, the Project will \nengage  consultants  to  develop  training  modules  and  materials  to  qualify  relevant  staff  to \npromote  community  mobilization  in  school  life.  Oblast  and  raion  officers  will  be  trained  to \nprovide advice to school managements, school boards, and mahallas (village committees) on \nschool improvements schemes and open schools to become social focal points in villages \noffering learning and recreation activities for all community members. \n \n58.  In order to address the lack of knowledge on the values of community participation in \nschool life and to foster the concept of opening schools for community activities, the Project will \nprovide funding to engage a professional domestic media firm to (i) prepare an awareness \ncampaign; and (ii) facilitate regular reporting in newspapers, radio, and television of community \nengagement in school activities and the achievements of successful community participation.  \n \n \n \n                                            \n27 UNICEF and the USAID Participation, Education, and Knowledge Strengthening (PEAKS) project successfully \nsupported community participation in pilot schools; a World Bank funded project also includes a component to \nstimulate community involvement in schools. See appendix 12 for detailed description. \n ", "15 \nC.  Special Features \n \n59.  The proposed Project is designed to complement the Government\u2019s NPBED aiming at \ncreating equal opportunities for all students by removing disparities between rural and urban \nschools. The Project has three key strategies to address regional inequalities: (i) upgrading \nschool facilities in rural areas; (ii) creating flexible mechanisms for further development of \nteachers engaged in rural schools by improving the quality and frequency of in-service training; \nand (iii) promoting community participation in school life to improve learning environments for \nstudents and opening schools to all community members for social and recreation activities and \nlearning programs. \n \n60.  Community participation is an important feature of the Project. A significant criterion for \nschools to be included for upgrading under the Project will be the extent to which communities \nare participating in school life and contributing to the maintenance and improvement of school \nfacilities.  The  communities  are  to  base  their  level  of  contribution  on  what  is  affordable. \nContributions from parents and other community members include cash, labor, or participation \nin  planning  and  implementation  of  school  improvement  activities.  Under  component  3  the \nProject provides support to establish and strengthen active school boards. The inclusion of \nschools for upgrading under component 1 will carried out on a competitive basis. School boards \nwill develop improvement plans jointly with school managements. The involvement of school \nboards in school management will improve public governance at schools. In opening rural \nschools  to  all  community  members  for  social  and  recreational  activities  and  learning  and \ninformation programs, the proposed Project will contribute to improve the living conditions in \npoor villages. Active community participation in school management and the design of after \nschool activities will ensure that training and recreational programs are demand driven.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n61.  The total project cost is estimated at $43.0 million equivalent. Project cost estimates by \nexpense category are in Table 1.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n63.  The Executing Agency (EA) of the Project will be MOPE, and it will appoint the project \ndirector who will coordinate the overall implementation of project activities. A project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  provide  strategic  guidance  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the Project. The PSC will be chaired by the minister of MOPE and consist of \neight  members  including  representatives  of  MOPE,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  three \nrepresentatives  from  mahalla  committees  and  oblast  administrations  of  the  three  project \nregions. The PSC will meet quarterly, or as often as required.  \n \n64.  The Project will be implemented through the current ESDP PIU (or any successor hereto \nacceptable to ADB28), which will be responsible for the overall implementation of activities. The \nESDP is expected to be completed in 2009. Additional six staff (a deputy project manager, a \nprocurement specialist, a finance specialist, a monitoring and evaluation [M&E] specialist, an \nadministrative assistant, and an accountant) will be engaged to facilitate activities of the Project. \nOffice space for the PIU will be provided by MOPE. The PIU will report to the project director \nand provide quarterly progress reports to the PSC, the management of MOPE, and ADB. A joint \nimplementation plan for 2008\u20132009 for activities under the ESDP and the Project will be agreed \nupon during the first quarter of implementation, and in coordination with other ADB-funded \nprojects. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n65.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years from January 2008 to December 2011. A \nProject Implementation Schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n                                            \n28 The Government is in the process of approving the center for coordination of investments and reforms in basic \neducation under the MOPE, which will centralize all PIUs established to implement investment projects in the \neducation sector. Once the center will be approved and operational, the Government will discuss and agree with \nthe ADB on the transfer of project staff to the new Center, which will coordinate activities under the Project. \n ", "17 \n3.  Procurement \n \n66.  All ADB-financed goods and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Project  will  provide \nlaboratory equipment, teaching aids, classroom furniture, and will equip libraries. Equipment \nand  goods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  under  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Equipment and materials estimated to cost $500,000 or less \nwill be procured under national competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Learning \nmaterials and other equipment and materials valued at $100,000 or less will be procured by \nshopping.  The  Government  has  prepared  a  procurement  plan  for  the  initial  18  months \n(Appendix 10). The procurement plan includes (i) particular contracts for the goods, works, and \nrelated services required to carry out the Project; (ii) proposed methods for procuring contracts \npermitted under the loan agreement; and (iii) related ADB review procedures. The Government \nwill update the procurement plan annually or as needed throughout project implementation. \nBefore the commencement of any procurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB \nand the Government will review the national public procurement law/regulations to ensure \nconsistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Any necessary modifications or clarifications \nwill be reflected in the procurement plan. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n67.  All consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Under the three project components, a \ntotal of 26 person-months of international consulting services and 85 person-months of national \nconsulting  services  will  be  contracted,  financed  by  ADB  funds.  International  and  national \nconsultants financed from ADB funds under component 2 will be recruited as a firm under \nquality and cost-based selection methods, using full technical proposals with 80:20 weighting29. \nIn addition to consultants contracted through a firm, the Government has requested to recruit \none individual international consultant and one individual national consultant to support activities \nin regard to promotion of community participation in school life. Consulting services under \ncomponents 2 and 3 will include experts in the field of teacher development and community \nparticipation. The Government has agreed to recruit staff for the PIU in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for recruiting individual consultants. In addition, the Project provides funding for \nengaging  national  training  providers  and  a  national  media  firm,  which  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference \nand a personnel schedule for the project consultants are in Appendix 11. \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n68.  The Government has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for the \nPIU\u2019s additional office equipment and a vehicle, and the recruitment of PIU staff, including a \ndeputy project manager, financial specialist, office assistant, and procurement specialist. The \nadvance contracting will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Retroactive  financing  will  apply  to  such  expenses \nincurred after ADB approval to proceed with loan negotiations for the Project until the date the \nloan  becomes  effective,  and  for  an  amount  not  exceeding  $100,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment was advised that ADB management\u2019s approval of advanced contracting will not \ncommit ADB to subsequently approve the project or to finance the procurement costs, and \nretroactive financing approved by ADB management in principle is subject to approval by the \nBoard, and as such does not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n                                            \n29 The total score for each consultant is calculated by weighting the scores for technical quality and cost and adding \nthem. The weight for technical quality is 80% and the weight for cost is 20%. http://adb.org/Consulting/qcbs.asp \n ", "18 \n6.   Anticorruption Policy \n \n69.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of MOPE and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  To  ensure  transparency  of  project\u2019s \nactivities, MOPE\u2019s website will present information on the Project implementation progress, \nincluding information on, among other things, (i) schools selected; (ii) teacher training programs; \nand (iii) procurement activities, including (a) lists of participating bidders, (b) names of the \nwinning  bidders,  (c)  basic  details  on  the  adopted  bidding  procedures,  (d)  amounts  of  the \ncontracts awarded, (e) the list of goods and/or services purchased, and (f) their intended and \nactual utilization. The implementation of an awareness campaign will serve as a mean to inform \ncommunities and schools of project activities and benefits, including sharing information on \ninvestments, allocation of resources, and project\u2019s beneficiaries. The communication process in \nthe  three  selected  regions  will  be  closely  monitored  during  review  missions  to  ensure \ntransparency and high involvement of schools and communities.  \n \n7.  Capacity Building, Staff Development, and Training \n \n70.  The Project will finance national and international consultants to design and conduct \ntraining programs to upgrade the skills and knowledge of selected staff from MOPE, school \nmanagers, school boards, oblast and raion administrators and methodologists, teacher trainers \nfrom TTIs, and teachers. Training and counseling of teachers will be conducted by oblast TTIs \nand raion methodologists and financed by the Government. Facilities of selected schools and \noblast TTIs in the three project provinces will be used for training programs. In addition, the \nProject  will  finance  (i)  national  training  providers  to  conduct  training  related  to  community \nparticipation, (ii) a national firm to conduct awareness measures, and (iii) a national firm to \nconduct  the  benchmark  survey  and  related  monitoring  activities.  MOPE  will  prepare  the \nselection criteria for training providers and firms for ADB approval. The PIU will provide ADB \nwith  a  list  of  potential  training  providers  and  firms,  and  detailed  costing  of  the  proposed \nmeasures. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n71.  The proposed loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will be established to \nexpedite disbursement of the project funds. The PIU will open the account in a commercial bank \nselected by the Government, acceptable to ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the \nimprest account will not exceed $100,000. The ceiling of the imprest account will not exceed \nestimated ADB-financed expenditures for 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower. \n \n72.  Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \nunder ADB-financed activities and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest account, in \naccordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. Each individual payment reimbursed or liquidated under the procedures will not \nexceed $20,000 equivalent for each item of expenditure. \n \n ", "19 \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n73.  Mope, as the EA, will maintain the project accounts and prepare financial statements \naccording to international accounting standards. MOPE will have the project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nCertified copies of the audited project accounts and audited financial statements (including the \nauditor\u2019s opinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with covenants, and the use of the \nimprest account and ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures) will be submitted to ADB in \nEnglish not later than 6 months after the end of each financial year. \n \n74.  The PIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation to be approved by the \nPSC and submit them to ADB within 30 days after the end of each quarter. Reports will be in a \nform acceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other matters, (i) progress made against \nestablished targets, (ii) problems and constraints encountered during the last quarter, (iii) steps \ntaken and proposed to be taken to resolve problems, (iv) compliance with covenants, and (v) \nthe proposed program of activities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after completion \nof the Project, the PIU will submit a project completion report to ADB providing details on project \nimplementation, accomplishments, costs, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n75.  The Government is preparing a project performance management system (PPMS) in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s current PPMS guidelines30. In addition to the performance targets and \nindicators specified in the project design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), the Project will \ndevelop  a  monitoring  mechanism  to  (i) assess  whether  new  teaching  equipment  is  fully \nintegrated into curriculum and lesson plans and utilized by teachers and students, (ii) review \nwhether managers and teachers trained under the Project apply their new knowledge and skills, \n(iii) evaluate project impacts on the participation of disabled students and students from poor \nfamilies, and (iv) monitor and evaluate gender equality in all project-related activities to measure \ncontribution towards achieving gender equality. Monitoring results will be used to adjust the \nannual  implementation  plans. Jointly  with  qualified  NGOs,  a  system will  be  established to \nmonitor drop-out and attendance rates in rural schools. Feedback from parents and teachers \nwill be collected to review whether improved learning environments have resulted in better \nlearning achievements. Rehabilitation works will be monitored by MOPE and reports will be \nsubmitted to the PSC and ADB on an annual basis. \n \n11.  Project Review \n \n76.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \nreviews will assess progress on each component, identify issues and constraints, and determine \nnecessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted at the end of \nthe second year of implementation. The midterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and \nimplementation arrangements, and identify adjustments required; (ii) assess progress of the \nproject implementation against performance indicators; and (iii) recommend changes in the \ndesign or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n77.  Project Benefits and Impacts. Restructuring and modernizing the education system is \na top priority in the Government\u2019s reform agenda. The NPBED investment of $1.2 billion is the \n                                            \n30 ADB. 2007. Guidelines for Preparing a Design and Monitoring Framework. Manila \n ", "20 \nkey strategy to remove disparities between rural and urban schools, and strengthen basic \neducation  to  meet  international  standards.  The  Project  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategic thrust, creating equal opportunities for all students. About 670,000 students enrolled in \nschools supported by the Project and about 63,000 teachers will benefit from upgraded school \nfacilities in the three project regions. Improved learning environments and modern teaching \ntechniques will improve opportunities for graduates from basic education schools to progress to \nhigher levels of education employment and enhance their income-earning opportunities at a \nlater stage. Assuming that around 30% of the population is considered to be poor, and that 70% \nof  low-income  families  live  in  rural  areas,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  enhancing  income \nopportunities of the students from poor families enrolled in rural basic schools. In addition, at the \nend of the project duration, it is assumed that at least 4,000 school board members and parents \nwill benefit from training under component 3. About 45,000 grade 5\u20139 teachers will benefit from \nnew teacher training programs. Approximately 1,600 school managers will benefit from training \nunder the Project. Further, about 450 methodologists, administrators, and teacher trainers will \nbenefit  from  training  programs  under  components  2  and  3.  Communities  will  benefit  from \nupgraded schools with active school boards and the use of school facilities for adult learning \nand extra-curriculum activities and social events. \n \n78.  To  improve  gender  responsiveness,  the  Project  will  develop  strategies  for  teacher \ntraining to address gender stereotypes in curriculum and material development. The Project was \ndesigned through a participatory process involving key government stakeholders at the national, \noblast, and raion levels, civil society groups, and parents. During implementation, the Project \nwill maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities. Involvement of communities in the \nschool selection process will contribute to the maintenance of a participatory approach. \n \n79.  New teacher training modules and training approaches developed under the Project and \ntested in the project schools will be incorporated into the national in-service training system and \nbenefit all grade 5\u20139 teachers engaged in basic education. Successful experiences of school \nboards will be replicated in other schools in Uzbekistan. \n \n80.  Sustainability.  It  can  be  assumed  that  the  project  activities  are  sustainable.  The \nGovernment is strongly committed to further improve the current education system. Budget \nprojections indicate that basic education funding will rise during the period 2008\u20132012. The \nmajor share of increases is committed to further rehabilitate and upgrade schools and lift \nteacher remuneration. All project activities will be implemented through existing structures of the \neducation sector, and thus they will become an integral part of the normal plan of activities. The \nGovernment\u2019s contribution to the Project in terms of civil works for school rehabilitation, O&M \ncosts for rehabilitated schools, duties, contingencies, and interest charges is included in the \nbudget, and an estimated at $13.0 million over 4 years. This will be less than 0.5% of the annual \ntotal expenditure on education. Further, the  Government has confirmed its commitment to \nincrease allocations for O&M of rehabilitated and upgraded school facilities under the Project. \nADB-financed provision of equipment, training, and other resources to schools will not result in \nsizable maintenance expenditures, and thus implications for the recurrent education budget are \ninsignificant. Enhanced community participation will result in additional support (cash and in-\nkind), thus reducing dependency on public allocations for maintenance expenditures. Budget \nprojections confirm that sufficient funds will be available to implement teacher development \nprograms in the project regions.31 \n                                            \n31To mitigate the risks associated with increased budget needs, ADB will conduct a study to assess and suggest    \nimproved approaches to education financing and sector efficiency. \n ", "21 \n81.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. ADB funding will not be used for civil works. \nThere  will  be  no  land  acquisition  required  and  no  negative  environmental  or  resettlement \nimpact. Some school rehabilitation works, financed by Government funds, will include improved \nwater supply and sanitation and sewage systems, which will promote good health and have a \npositive  environmental  impact.  Reading  materials  and  teacher  guides  provided  under  the \nProject  will  consider  ethnic  minority  languages.  Furthermore,  it  was  agreed  that  school \nmanagements  will  provide  plans  on  (i)  proper  waste  treatment;  (ii)  training  programs  for \nstudents  and  science  teachers  on  proper  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous  and  toxic \nmaterials, and other safety measures in the laboratory; and (iii) regular emergency drills in order \nrespond to fire and chemical spills. Teacher training courses will be held in local minority \nlanguages of instruction; teacher trainers will be trained accordingly by the TTIs. Based on \ndemand, resources will be allocated for teacher training courses in minority languages.   \n \n82.  Assumptions. Successful implementation of the Project assumes that the Government \nwill (i) maintain the budget allocation for basic education as indicated, (ii) be committed to \nmodernizing the education system, (iii) provide adequate funding to finance in-service training \nas planned, and (iv) provide sufficient funds for O&M to rehabilitated and upgraded schools.  \n \n83.  Risks. At present, managerial and technical capacity at all levels within the education \nsystem  is  limited  and  might  affect  the  smooth  implementation  of  reforming  the  education \nsystem. This risk will be mitigated through training measures for teachers and managers at rural \nschools  and  relevant  staff  of  raion  administrations  and  TTIs  under  the  Project,  and  other \ncapacity-building activities under ADB-financed projects.  \n \n84.  Financial risks involve potential difficulties in the provision of recurrent costs for O&M of \nupgraded schools. During project implementation, ADB will work closely with the Government to \nensure adequate resource allocation for the education sector and incremental recurrent costs \nfor O&M. Appropriate assurances are included in the project design. In addition, the Project\u2019s \nstrategy aims at reducing the dependency on public allocations by promoting income generation \nat the school level.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n85.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Agreement,  the \nGovernment  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  into  the  legal \ndocuments. \n \n86.  Counterpart Funding. The Government shall maintain annual expenditure for education \nsector activities during project implementation at not less than 7.5% of GDP. Throughout project \nimplementation, the Government will allocate and release in a timely manner adequate budget \nfunding for (i) constructing and/or rehabilitating schools during 2007\u20132009, (ii) supporting \nteacher  training  programs,  (iii)  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  O&M  of  schools \nsupported under the Project, and (iv) interest charges. Throughout project implementation, \nthe Government will provide ADB with information on allocations and actual expenditures for the \nbasic  education  system  and  specifically  for  Project  schools  through  submission  of  annual \nreports, in a form acceptable to ADB.   \n87.  School Selection Criteria and Process. The Government will ensure that selection of \nschools under the Project is carried out based on the agreed criteria and a competitive two-\nstage process as described in Appendix 7. The Government will also ensure that all selected \nschools (i) prior to 31 December 2008, develop plans on proper waste treatment and develop \ntraining programs for proper handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic materials, and other \n ", "22 \nsafety measures in the science laboratories; (ii) throughout project implementation, conduct \nregular fire and chemical spills drills in accordance with Government\u2019s environmental and health \nand  safety  laws  and  regulations.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  based  on  demand,  \neducation  and  reading  materials  and  teacher  training  courses  under  the  project  are  also \nprovided in the languages of the ethnic minorities. \n    \n88.    Teacher Development. The Government shall ensure that the in-service teacher training \nmodel is integrated in the national in-service teacher training system by 31 December 2010.  \nSuch in-service teacher training model shall focus on the specific needs of teachers taking into \nconsideration the working conditions in rural areas to ensure full participation of rural teachers in \ntraining opportunities. \n  \n89.   Construction and Rehabilitation of Schools.  The Government will ensure that the \nconstruction and rehabilitation of schools under NPBED is completed by 1 September 2010. \nThe Government will also ensure that all civil works under the Project (a) are carried out in \naccordance with the national environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); and (b) do not \nrequire any land acquisition.  For the avoidance of doubt, any construction for the Project will be \ncarried out only on unoccupied and unused public land. \n \n90.  Project Performance Management System. The Government will ensure that, within \n3 months of the loan effectiveness, the PIU establishes the PPMS to monitor progress of project \nimplementation and evaluate project impacts based on the key baseline indicators agreed \nbetween MOPE and ADB. \n \n91.  Transparency  and  Anticorruption.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents; (ii) all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project; and (iii) an audit of \nprocurement activities is carried out at least twice during project implementation. The cost of the \naudit will be financed by the Project provided that the auditor is selected though a competitive \nprocess and has qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to ADB.  \n \n92.  The Government will establish, within 6 months from loan effectiveness, a dedicated \nwebpage  on  the  MOPE\u2019s  website  which  will  present  information  on  the  project  progress, \nincluding  information  on,  among  other  things,  schools  selected  under  the  Project,  teacher \ntraining programs, and procurement activities, including the list of participating bidders, names \nof  the  winning  bidders,  basic  details  on  the  adopted  bidding  procedures,  amounts  of  the \ncontracts awarded, the list of goods and/or services purchased, and their intended and actual \nutilization. \n \n93.  Effectiveness Conditions. Prior to loan effectiveness, the Government will engage \nadditional six staff for PIU, including a deputy project manager, a procurement specialist, \na finance specialist, a monitoring and evaluation specialist, an administrative assistant, \nand an accountant. The deputy project manager to be recruited and appointed for the \nProject should be acceptable to ADB. \n ", "23 \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n94.

With net enrolment and literacy rates both estimated at over 99% and no significant \ngender  differentials  in  primary  education,  Uzbekistan  scores  high  on  the  two  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating gender disparity in \nprimary and secondary education. The Constitution of Uzbekistan stipulates that all citizens are \nentitled to free general education. \n \n2.  In 2004, the Government made a decision to extend the schooling period by 1 year and \nestablish a compulsory 12-year education system gradually by 2009. After completion of basic \neducation (grade 9), students will either continue with a 3-year senior secondary education \n(SSE) course at academic lyceums, or enroll in professional colleges, which will offer a 3-year \nprogram combining a vocational specialty with general education. This will also provide the \nqualification to enroll in higher education institutions after graduation. Thus, by 2009 across the \ncountry, the reformed education system will comprise (i) preschooling, (ii) primary education of \ngrades 1\u20134, (iii) secondary education of grades 5\u20139, (iv) SSE of grades 10\u201312, and (v) higher \neducation.  \n \nFigure A2.1: The Formal Education System in Uzbekistan \nAge  Grade  Type  Level\n    \nPost-graduate  \u21d2 Doctor of Science (Doktor Nauk)\n  Post-graduate   \nand Doctoral  \u21d2 Candidate of Science K(andidat Nauk)\n25  19 Studies  Education\n  Professional  \n24 18 Masters  \u21d2 Maters Degree Diploma\n    Programs \n23 17 Program\n  (Medicine up to   \n22 16 \u21d2 Bachalors Degree Diploma\n21  15 Bachalors  12 years) Higher Education\n20  14 Program \n \n19 13\n18  G 12  Senior Secondary  \u21d2 Graduation Certificate for Academic Lyceums\n17  G 11  Academic   Professional Specialized  Diploma for Professional Colleges \n16  G 10  Lyceum College Vocational Education\n      \n15 G 9 \u21d2 Certificate (Attestat)\n   \n14 G 8\n13  G 7  Secondary School\n   \n12 G 6\n    Basic (General) \n11 G 5\n    Education\n10 G 4\n   \n9 G 3  \n    Primary School\n8 G 2\n   \n7 G 1\n \n3\u20136\nNursery/Kindergarten Preschool\nCompulsory Education\n \n \nSource: Ministry of Public Education. \n \n3.  In order to support the restructure of the education system into a 12-year school system, \nthe Government launched the National Program for Basic Education Development (NPBED) \n2004\u20132009, which aims to strengthen basic education to meet international standards and \nremove disparities between rural and urban schools, thereby creating equal opportunities for all \nstudents. The NPBED promotes reforms in the basic education system by (i) providing financial \nsupport to improve the physical school conditions through construction and rehabilitation of \nbuildings and facilities; (ii) equipping all basic schools with new laboratories, modern computer \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nrooms, furniture, and teaching aids; (iii) providing free textbooks and educational materials to \nteachers; (iv) improving education standards, (v) reviewing and modernizing the curriculum \nframework; (vi) ensuring that rural areas are provided with highly qualified teaching staff; (vii) \nintroducing new student-centered teaching approaches; (viii) increasing teacher incentives to \nwork in the more deprived areas; and (ix) developing sports activities in schools through the \nprovision of sports equipment to all basic schools. The investment costs of the program, which \nare estimated at $1.2 billion, are being financed by a combination of 75% budget financing, 20% \nforeign  investment  financing,  and  5%  local  donor  contributions.  Major  investments  include \nschool construction and rehabilitation, and significant salary increases for teachers and school \nprincipals in order to improve incentives and entice qualified university graduates to become \nteachers. \n  \n4.  In  order  to  implement  the  NPBED,  the  School  Development  Fund  (SDF)  was \nestablished. Its main objectives are to accumulate sufficient funds to finance civil works for the \nconstruction and rehabilitation of schools and provide a minimum package of furniture and \nlaboratory, library, computers, and sports equipment. The SDF is financed by a 1% tax on \nenterprise revenues and by contributions from donors, local sponsors, and local government. \nAlthough under the program many schools have been successfully rehabilitated, Government \ncapacity to meet all school rehabilitation needs, provide much-needed new classroom furniture, \nand  upgrade  laboratory  equipment  and  teaching  aids  nationally  is  limited.  Thus,  the \nGovernment  will  partially  depend  on  external  assistance  to  successfully  implement  the \nambitious reform program. \n \n5.  The  main  education  policy-making  bodies  are  the  Office  of  the  President  and  the \nCabinet of Ministers. While basic education (grades 1\u20139) is administered by the Ministry of \nPublic Education (MOPE), academic lyceums, professional colleges, and universities are the \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Senior Secondary and Higher Education (MOSSHE). MOPE is \nresponsible for formulating strategies to implement education policies, setting standards in \ngeneral education, teacher training, curriculum, and textbook development, and administers the \nprovision of general education through oblast (province) and raion (district) departments of \neducation and schools. In 2004, the Government restructured the functions and tasks of MOPE \nand MOSSHE and its associated institutions at the national and the oblast levels to make the \nsystem more responsive and relevant to the requirements of a market economy. \n \n6.  Preschool Education. Preschool education covers students up to the age of 7. Since \n1991 the number of preschool educational institutions has decreased by one third, from 9,834 \nschools in 1991 to 6,603 in 2005. Preschool enrollments have declined by 57% over the same \nperiod, from 1.339 million to 575,000, and the number of preschool teachers has dropped from \n104,000 to 63,700 (a drop of 39%). During the Soviet period kindergartens were funded by state \nenterprises, however after independence many of them closed or could no longer afford to \nprovide preschool facilities for their workers. In an attempt to compensate for the closure of \npreschool facilities, in 1997 the Government increased the right to maternity leave to 3 years, \nand  mothers  were  provided  with  financial  support  for  their  children  in  the  form  of  child \nallowances until the age of 2. These allowances currently are paid through mahallas (village \ncommittees).

Basic Education. Basic education starts at the age of 7. With the introduction of the \nnew 12-year school system by 2009, the current basic education system is being restructured \ninto primary education (grades 1\u20134) and junior secondary education (grades 5\u20139). Previously, \njunior secondary education also included grade 10. The curriculum framework has been revised \nto  respond  to  the  structural  change,  and  teacher  development  programs  are  adjusted \naccordingly.  Table  A2.2  provides  information  on  students  and  teachers,  showing  gender \ndistribution by grades in urban and rural areas. As the transformation is currently ongoing in line \nwith the construction of new SSE schools, reliable statistics for the school year 2005\u20132006 \nproviding information on grade 12 enrollments and teacher numbers within the newly forming \nSSE system are not yet available. In the school year 2004\u20132005 there was 449,200 teachers, of \nwhich 115,700 taught in urban schools and 333,500 in rural schools. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.2: Student Enrollments and Teachers, 2003\u20132004 and 2004\u20132005 \n \n   2003\u20132004 School Year  2004\u20132005 School Year \nStudents  %, by  Students  %, by \n  (\u2018000)  % of Total  Gender  (\u2018000)  % of Total  Gender \nItem   F  M  F  M  F  M  F  M  F  M  F  M \nStudents                         \nUrban  937.0  1018.4  100.0  100.0  47.9  52.1  909.3  996.3  100.0  100.0  47.7  52.3 \nRural  2,092.0  2174.1  100.0  100.0  47.7  52.3  2,072.0  2,152.9  100.0  100.0  49.0  51.0 \nStudents in Grades 1\u20134  1,193.7  1257.4  39.4  39.4  48.7  51.3  1159.4  1,223.9  38.9  38.9  48.6  51.4 \nUrban  385.7  411.6  41.2  40.4  48.3  51.7  371.1  397.4  40.8  39.9  48.3  51.7 \nRural  808.0  845.8  38.6  38.9  48.9  51.1  788.3  826.5  38.0  38.4  48.8  51.2 \nStudents in Grades 5\u20139  1,532.7  1609.8  50.6  50.4  48.8  51.2  1,533.3  1,609.9  51.4  51.1  48.8  51.2 \nUrban  490.1  528.8  52.3  51.9  48.1  51.9  482.8  522.7  53.1  52.5  48.0  52.0 \nRural  1,042.6  1,081.0  49.8  49.7  49.1  50.9  1,050.5  1,087.2  50.7  50.5  49.1  50.9 \nStudents in Grades 10\u201311  302.7  325.3  10.0  10.2  48.2  51.8  281.8  302.8  9.5  9.6  48.2  51.2 \nUrban  61.2  78  6.5  7.7  44.0  56.0  49.6  65.8  5.5  6.6  43.0  57.0 \nRural  241.5  247.3  11.6  11.4  49.4  50.6  232.2  237  11.2  11.0  49.5  50.5 \nSpecial schools  7.0  12.2  0.2  0.4  36.6  63.4  6.8  12.6  0.2  0.4  35.1  64.9 \nUrban  6.0  9.9  0.6  1.0  37.6  62.4  5.8  10.4  0.6  1.0  35.8  64.2 \nRural  1.0  2.3  0.1  0.1  31.9  68.1  1.0  2.2  0.1  0.1  31.3  68.7 \nTotal students  3,029.1  3,192.5  100.0  100.0  48.7  51.3  2,981.3  3,149.2  100.0  100.0  48.6  51.4 \n                         \nFull-Time Teachers                            \nUrban  94.0  24.5  31.8  15.6  79.3  20.7  89.3  26.4  30.2  17.2  77.2  22.8 \nRural  201.4  131.9  68.2  84.4  60.4  39.5  206.4  127.1  69.8  82.8  61.9  38.1 \nTotal  295.4  156.4  100.0  100.0  65.4  34.6  295.7  153.5  100.0  100.0  65.8  34.2 \nF = female, M = male. \nSource: Gender Equality in Uzbekistan, State Statistics Committee, 2005. \n \n8.  Senior Secondary Education. The SSE system is currently in a transition period from a \n2-year system into a compulsory 3-year system. By 2009, students who completed grade 9 at \nbasic education schools will either continue for 3 years at academic lyceums, or enroll in \nprofessional colleges, which will provide a 3-year program combining a vocational specialty with \ngeneral education. In the school year 2006\u20132007, about 919,400 students were enrolled in \n1,055 SSE institutions. It is projected that in school year 2009\u20132010 about 1.6 million students \nwill be enrolled in SSE institutions (assuming 100% coverage of grade 9 graduates). In order to \nprovide adequate classroom and training facilities, the Government  plans to establish 176 \nacademic lyceums and 1,691 vocational colleges by 2009. Based on a broad review of all \nexisting SSE institutions, rehabilitation and construction works started in 2004. The number of \nSSE institutions has been increased from 869 in 2004 to 1,055 in 2006. The Government \nconfirmed  that  additional  funding  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  provision  of \nconsumables for training workshops will be included in the SSE budget. In order to improve the \nquality and relevance of SSE education, curriculum modules for skills training are being revised \nin close cooperation with industry, and strategies to improve the in-service training system for \nvocational teachers are being reviewed. \n \n9.  Higher Education. The higher education system comprises undergraduate (bachelor) \nprograms of 4 years, postgraduate (master\u2019s) programs of 2 years, and doctorate programs of \n3\u20136  years  (depending  on  the  field  of  research).  The  higher  education  subsector  currently \ncomprises 64 institutions with an estimated enrollment of more than 260,000 students. Thirty-\nfour higher education institutions are administered by MOSSHE, with about 54,000 students \n ", "Appendix 2  31 \nenrolled in the 2006\u20132007 school year. In 2004 women represented only 40% of the total \nenrollment  in  higher  education  (Table  A2.3).  Women  are  significantly  underrepresented  in \ntechnical and science courses and their subject choices tend to be concentrated on educational, \nsocial, and health-related disciplines. \n \nTable A2.3: Total Higher Education Enrollment by Gender: 2000\u20132005 \n \n  2000\u20132001  2001\u20132002  2002\u20132003  2003\u20132004  2004\u20132005 \nStudents  No.  %  No.  %  No.  %  No.  %  No.  % \nFemale   69,400  37.8  80,100  38.7  90,400  38.9  98,800  36.9  107,300  40.7 \nMale  114,200  62.2  127,100  61.3  141,900  61.1  155,600  63.1  156,300  59.3 \nTotal   183,600    207,200    232,300    254,400    263,600   \nSource: Ministry of Senior Secondary and Higher Education, 2006. \n \n10.  Challenges for Basic Education. The Government has demonstrated continued strong \ncommitment  to  reform  of  the  education  sector,  completing  the  transition  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \neducation system from the Soviet model to a system that is consistent with internationally \naccepted requirements. In line with the restructuring of the school system, fundamental policy \nreforms in the organization, management, staffing, and financing of the education sector have \nbeen introduced. However, capacities of MOPE at national level are limited and need to be \nfurther strengthened in order to further improve effectiveness and efficiency in the sector. MOPE \nneeds to build additional capacity in strategic planning, policy analysis, research, and impact-\noriented monitoring. At present, an effective planning structure is not in place, due partly to \nlimited qualified staff and because data collected are not subjected to systematic analyses. \nAlthough data is regularly collected from all levels, it appears that it is not directly used for \nplanning and decision making. The current education management information system is poorly \nmaintained and inefficient to monitor education quality. \n \n11.  The following are the key issues in rural basic education.  \n \n(i)  Poor school facilities and disparities between rural and urban schools as \nrevealed by the 2004 school mapping survey. This issue is being addressed \nby  comprehensive  rehabilitation  works  under  the  NPBED  program.  Major \ninvestments of the proposed Project will be utilized for upgrading rural schools to \ncomplement the Government efforts to raise education standards in rural areas. \nMore information on school facilities is provided in Appendix 3. \n \n(ii)  Outdated teaching skills and knowledge. Teaching techniques and subject \nknowledge of many teachers are considered inadequate and outdated and need \nto be upgraded and aligned with the revised curriculum. Most teachers still apply \ntraditional  teaching  methods,  devoting  attention  mostly  to  narrow  subject \nknowledge, requiring students to memorize and repeat notions and definitions. \nCritical thinking, problem solving, communication skills, and teamwork do not \nreceive sufficient attention. Although training programs for teachers have been \nrevised by MOPE in 2005, the current in-service training system needs to be \nmore flexible to adjust to specific subject-related requirements of teachers in rural \nschools, who work under difficult circumstances. At present, the majority of in-\nservice  training  curricula  for  all  subject  areas  are  developed  by  the  Central \nRepublican In-Service Teacher Training Institute. Based on these curricula the \nprovincial teacher training institutes (TTIs) develop training courses for teachers. \nUnder the existing in-service system, teachers are required to participate in a 24-\nday training every 3 years. This combines residential training at the provincial \nTTI, followed by practice activities at their home school. In-service training for \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nnewly assigned teachers consist of 18 days residential training followed by 6 \ndays  practice  at  their  home  schools;  in-service  training  for  other  teachers \nconsists of 12 days residential training followed by 12 days practice at their home \nschools. Feedback from teachers revealed that most in-service training modules, \nas currently drafted, are too general in nature, too theoretical in orientation, and \ninsufficiently grounded in the practical conditions teachers have to cope with, \nparticularly in rural schools. There is also a need for improvement of instructional \ndesign process standards. Currently statements of goals and objectives often do \nnot provide sufficient specific information; new teaching methodologies to be \nintroduced need to be explained through constant references to, and examples \nfrom, the subject areas to be taught; and the language and format of training \nmodules need to be simplified so that they can be understood easily by both \ntrainers  and  teachers.  Guidance  provided  to  teachers  during  their  practice \nactivities  at  their  home  schools  is  weak.  Due  to  the  lack  of  a  monitoring \nmechanism, no feedback is available to assess whether new teaching methods \nand  knowledge  is  applied  in  the  classrooms  after  completion  of  in-service \ntraining.  Field  visits  revealed  the  dominance  of  the  textbook  as  a  teaching-\nlearning material in the classroom. It is recommended to broaden the range of \nteaching-learning materials, including books, and other reading materials. The \nintegration  between  curriculum  revision,  teacher  training,  and  textbook \ndevelopment also needs to be strengthened. \n \n(iii)  Curriculum modernization. The current curriculum is overloaded with subjects \nand  content  requirements  with  insufficient  emphasis  on  modern  learning \nmethodologies, and these are no longer consistent with the need for greater \nflexibility  in  subject  selection  and  a  student-centered  teaching  environment. \nMOPE has started the process of revising the curriculum framework. If curriculum \nreform is to have the desired impact, immediate steps must be taken to bring in-\nservice  teacher  training  and  textbook  development  into  line  with  a  reformed \ncurriculum framework. To accomplish this, the training of teacher trainers is an \nindispensable  step.  Textbooks  must  be  revised  to  incorporate  the  principles \nunderlying the new curriculum and to reflect its teaching methodologies. While \nthe full synchronization of curriculum, teacher training, and textbooks will take \nconsiderable time, a short- and long-term plan of action for its achievement must \nbe put in place. The ADB-funded STDP provides assistance to modernize the \ncurriculum  framework  and  strengthen  textbook  development  and  learning \nassessment  \n \n ", "Appendix 2  33 \n  \n \n \n \nFigure A2.2: Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nED = education department, HR = human resources, ICT = information and communications technology. \nSource: Ministry of Public Education. \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nSCHOOL FACILITIES  \n \n1.  Situational Analysis of Basic Education School Facilities. About 80% of Uzbekistan\u2019s \n9,773 basic schools are located in rural areas. In 2004, a comprehensive school survey was \ncarried out to review (i) school capacities; (ii) actual enrollments, (iii) the overall condition of \nschool  buildings  including  classrooms,  laboratory  and  library  rooms,  workshops,  and \ngymnasiums; (iv) state of utilities and sanitary facilities; and (v) the quantity and condition of \nschool furniture and sports equipment.  The  survey  revealed  that  out of the 9,727 schools \ncovered by the study, 684 schools were considered in very poor condition requiring emergency \nrepairs, and more than 90% were in poor condition requiring major rehabilitation and repairs. The \nclassroom capacity of schools was not in line with the growing number of students; about 1.7 \nmillion or 28% of students were studying in 2\u20133 shift schools. \n \n2.  The majority of schools were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s and have seriously \ndeteriorated  as  a  consequence  of  severe  weather  conditions,  continuous  use,  and  poor \nmaintenance due to years of underfunding since 1991. The deterioration of the school facilities \nhas  been  further  exacerbated  by  the  poor  construction  technology  and  inferior  quality  of \nconstruction materials used. Common defects are leaking roofs, water infiltration to the building \nstructures, damaged and leaking windows and doors, defective wooden floors, malfunctioning \nsanitary and plumbing facilities, broken heating systems, and leaking water supply systems. Most \nclassroom furniture is in very poor condition. Many schools have no heating and sanitary water \nsupply facilities. About 71% of the schools have no basic science laboratory equipment and about \n85% of the schools have no modern computers.  \n  \n3.  The survey also revealed great disparities between urban and rural schools in the quality \nof  school  facilities,  allotment  of  teachers,  and  allocation  and  quality  of  materials,  teaching \nequipment, and furniture. Urban schools are better equipped in almost every respect. \n \n4.  School Mapping System. To make efficient use of the voluminous data collected from \nschools, the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) established a computerized school mapping \nsystem to process approximately 1,400 indicators generated from the survey forms. The system \nis  currently  being  administered  by  the  information  and  communication  technology  unit \nestablished under the office of the deputy minister of MOPE, and staffed by an information and \ncommunication technology specialist and two support staff. In order to ensure regular update of \nschool data, in 2006 the information gathering was decentralized to the oblast (province) and \nraion  (district)  levels.  The  MOPE  oblast  departments  are  responsible  for  electronically \nsubmitting quarterly updated information of all schools in their province.  \n \n5.  School  Rehabilitation  Under  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education \nDevelopment (NPBED). Addressing the issue of poor school facilities, 8,476 schools have \nbeen selected to be upgraded under the NPBED by 2009. Government data indicates that 3,061 \nschools had been rehabilitated by 2006. In 2007, a total of 60 new schools are planned for \nconstruction and 1,591 schools are programmed for rehabilitation. In 2008, the Government \nplans to construct 64 new basic education schools and upgrade the physical facilities of 1,805 \nexisting schools. In 2009, 61 new basic education schools will be built and 1,843 existing \nschools will be upgraded. The planned civil works under the NPBED are presented in Table \nA3.1. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  35 \n \nTable A3.1: Civil Works under National Program for Basic Education Development \n \nScope of Civil Works   \n  New  Major/Capital  Major  Current  Total \nYear  Construction  Reconstruction  Repair  Repair  Status \n2007  60  490  729  372  1,651  Under \nimplementation \n2008  64  558  817   430  1869  Planned \n2009  61  591  825  427  1,904  Planned \nTotal    5,424   \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates based on Ministry of Public Education data. \n \n6.  Low  Provision  of  Science  Laboratory  Equipment  to  Upgraded  Schools.  While \nphysical  rehabilitation  is  progressing,  field  visits  to  rural  schools  revealed  that  additional \nresources are required to provide laboratory equipment, furniture, teaching aids, and reading \nmaterials  to  all  rehabilitated  schools.  MOPE  data  indicates  that  by  2006,  out  of  3,061 \nrehabilitated  schools,  only  1,387  schools  had  received  the  complete  package  of  science \nlaboratory equipment with teaching aids for chemistry and physics, and 1,506 schools had \nreceived equipment packages for biology. Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing under the \nproposed Project will help the Government to comprehensively upgrade the schools covered by \nthe NPBED. \n7.  Low Utilization of New Laboratory Equipment. Field visits revealed that teachers \nneed urgent assistance to utilize new science equipment in classroom lessons for practical \nexperiments. It was noted that new equipment supplied to the schools under the NPBED is \nbeing used for demonstration purposes only. Component 2 of the proposed Project will provide \nsupport to teachers to integrate new equipment into lessons plans so as to be used by students \nfor experiments. \n8.  Lack of Reading Materials and Furniture in the Library. School libraries are poorly \nequipped. Most libraries are providing mainly textbooks and reading material which is outdated \nand  not  in  demand  by  students  and  teachers.  School  librarians  reported  demand  for \nencyclopedias, computer manuals, detective stories, novels, poetry, romance, and children \nbooks. It was further noted that the library rooms visited during the field trips do not have \nadequate tables, chairs, and bookshelves.  \n9.  Community  Participation.  Field  visits  revealed  the  importance  of  community \nparticipation  is  maintaining  school  facilities.  Schools  where  parents,  teachers  and  other \ncommunity members are actively engaged in providing support are better maintained than \nschools with low community participation. During vacation periods parents and teachers help to \nclean schools and assist in minor repair and repainting works; community members and parents \nprovide in-kind support and cash for maintenance work. \n10.  Low Budget for Building Maintenance. Insufficient budget allocations for preventive \nmaintenance have resulted in the considerable deterioration of school buildings over the last 15 \nyears. Form 2002 to 2004, of the total recurrent basic education budget, the average share in \nthe expenditure for building maintenance was below 0.5%. In 2006, the recurrent budget for \nbuilding maintenance was increased to about 1.5% (SUM10 billion) of the recurrent budget, and \nthis  is  still considered insufficient. Sustaining  the  physical  condition of  rehabilitated  school \nfacilities is a priority concern that needs to be addressed in the future. The current average \ncapital investment cost for the construction of a classroom under the NPBED (taking into \naccount the average costs for ancillary spaces such as corridors, offices, and teachers\u2019 and \n ", "36  Appendix 3 \nlibrary  rooms)  is  estimated  at  $7,000.  Based  on  international  experience,  the  annual \nmaintenance budget for a classroom should be at least 2% of its capital cost, or $140 per \nclassroom  per  year.  Considering  that  the  basic  education  system  has  a  total  of  217,465 \nclassrooms, the total budget for school building maintenance should be at least $30.4 million \n(SUM38  billion)  per  year.  The  Government  has  appreciated  the  importance  of  providing \nadequate funding to ensure appropriate maintenance of school facilities rehabilitated under the \nNPBED. The Government has committed to provide sufficient funding for maintenance for all \nschools supported under the Project, and this is included in the Project assurances. Further, the \nGovernment committed to increasing the allocation for operation and maintenance substantially \nafter the rehabilitation of schools under the NPBED is completed by shifting funding within the \nbudget for basic education from capital investments to recurrent budget.  \n \n11.  Enhancing Community Participation. Community participation is an important feature \nof the Project. A significant criterion for schools to be included for upgrading under the Project \nwill be the extent to which communities are participating in school life and contribute to maintain \nand improvement of school facilities. The selection of schools for ADB support will be carried \nout on a competitive basis, fostering community participation and ensuring that equipment and \nmaterials provided to schools are effectively and efficiently utilized. In close cooperation with \nschool boards, principals of schools will be invited to prepare a school improvement plan, which \nwill provide information on  \n \n(i)  community participation in school life; \n(ii)  inventory indicating quantity and  current condition of biology, chemistry, and \nphysics laboratories, teaching-aids, furniture, supplies and consumables;  \n(iii)  availability of teachers, and laboratory assistants for each science subject and \ntheir qualifications;  \n(iv)  plans ensuring that new equipment will be fully utilized by students and teachers \nfor laboratory experiments; \n(v)  the method for monitoring that equipment is integrated into the teaching process; \n(vi)  sufficient funding for operation and maintenance of the equipment and provision \nof consumables;  \n(vii)  planned after-school activities; \n(viii)  planned fundraising activities, and estimated revenues or in-kind assistance to \nsupport  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  science  laboratory  rooms  and \nequipment; and \n(ix)  a plan to encourage students, teachers, and community members to maximize \nthe use of reading materials to be provided to the library.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4  37 \nEDUCATION SECTOR FINANCING \n \n1.  Restructuring  and  modernizing  the  education  system  is  a  top  priority  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy. Public expenditure for education has increased every year \nsince 2000, and reached 8.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006. The Government \nestimates  that  in  2007  the  share  of  the  education  expenditure  in  GDP  will  reach  9.4%, \nrepresenting over 40% of total public expenditure.1 The high level of budget allocation for the \neducation sector reflects the continuing commitment of the Government to strengthening the \neducation system.  \n2.  The  education  sector  is  financed  principally  from  three  sources:  (i)  central,  oblast \n(provincial), and raion (district) recurrent and investment budgets; (ii) foreign assistance; and (iii) \nthe off-budget School Development Fund (SDF). The SDF was established to finance school \nrehabilitation  and  construction  works  under  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education \nDevelopment (NPBED) 2004\u20132009. An overview on education expenditure as a proportion of \nGDP and total public expenditure is provided in Table A4.1. \n \n3.  Education financing in Uzbekistan has been decentralized. In the past, approximately \n65% of recurrent expenditures for basic education were provided through raion budgets, 22% \nfrom oblast budgets and 13% from the central republican budget. In accordance with the law on \nthe budget system and tax code, local budgets are formed from (i) local taxes and duties, (ii) \nstate taxes and duties, (iii) subsidies and budget subventions and (iv) interbudgetary loans.2 \nHowever, clear targets for revenue collection and distribution of funds for education institutions \nhave not been set. The success of the decentralized financing system depends on the ability of \noblast  and  raion  administrations  to  collect  sufficient  local  revenues  to  cover  education \nexpenditures. In case of insufficient revenue generation at the local level, the system includes \nthe risk of inadequate allocation for operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and regional \nimbalances. The risk of underfinancing is mitigated through transfers from the republican budget \nthat should cover shortfalls. At present, in Uzbekistan only five oblasts (Bukhara, Kashkadarya, \nNavoi, Tashkent oblast, and Tashkent City) out of 14 oblasts have sufficient tax revenues to \nfund their expenditure without support from the republican budget.3 However, comparing the \naverage budget allocation per student, Ministry of Finance data confirms that the regional \ndistribution of the educational budget is balanced, with an even per-student allocation nationally. \nTable A4.1: Education Expenditure as a Proportion of GDP and Total Public Expenditure \n(SUM billion) \n Item  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007a \nGDP   3,256  4,925  7,469  9,838  12,261  15,210  20,779  22,930 \nTotal Public Expenditure  943  1,314  1,925  2,377  2,793  3,420  4,389  5,335 \nPublic Expenditure on Education   314  434  676  814  1,009  1,339  1,689  2,144 \nRecurrent  218  336  501  623  765  992  1,435  1,780 \nCapital  95  95  142  175  181  214  \u2014  \u2014 \nForeign-Financeda   \u2014  \u2014  33  16  62  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \nSchool Development Off-budget Fund  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  134  254  364 \nPEOE as a Share of GDP (%)  9.6  8.8  9.1  8.3  8.2  8.8  8.1  9.4 \nPEOE as a Share of TPE (%)  33.3  33.0  35.1  34.3  36.1  39.1  38.5  40.2 \nGDP = gross domestic product, PEOE = public expenditure on education, TPE = total public expenditure. \na Ministry of Finance estimates  \nb no information was provided for 2005\u20132007 \nSource: Ministry of Finance,.   \n                                            \n1  The average proportion for education expenditure of GDP in all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) countries was about 5.6% in 2006. \n2  In 2003, the average composition of local budgets was (i) 63 % from state taxes and duties directed to local budgets, (ii) 20% \nfrom subventions and budget subsidies, and (iii) 17% from local taxes and duties. \n3  In 2003, the most significant republican subsidies were allocated to Karakalpakstan (over 57% of budgeted expenditure), \nDjizzakh (55%), and Surkhandarya (48%).

Subsectoral  shares  of  public \neducation expenditure have fluctuated in support of increased allocations for basic education. \nThe share of basic education expenditure in the total education expenditure increased from 37% \nin 2000 to 56% in 2006 and is estimated to reach 58% in 2007. Allocations to basic education \nwere  increased  significantly  from  2004  onwards  to  finance  the  comprehensive  school \nrehabilitation program and substantial salary increases for teachers under the NPBED.

Expenditure Categories in Basic Education. Expenditures for basic education are \ndivided into capital and recurrent expenditures. Capital expenditures consist of three major \ncategories: (i) construction, (ii) equipment and furniture, and (iii) learning materials. Recurrent \nexpenditures consist of six major categories: (i) salaries and social contributions, (ii) office \nsupplies, (iii) food, (iv) building maintenance including minor building repairs, (v) utilities, and (vi) \nother recurrent expenditures. In 2006, about 90% of the total recurrent expenditure was utilized \nfor personnel costs, which include salaries, allowances, and social security. Over the past 4 \nyears  the  Government  has  introduced  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  teachers\u2019 \nremuneration, including salary increases and the establishment of a new performance-based \nincentive  system4  for  education  personnel.  The  new  incentive  scheme  includes  monthly \nadditional top-ups to the basic salary rates to reward high-performing teachers. To facilitate \nrewarding schemes for teachers, a director\u2019s fwas set up in each school in the amount of up to \n15% of total annual payroll. According to MOPE data, during 2006 about 187,000 teachers \nreceived top-ups through the director\u2019s funds for a total amount of about SUM54 billion. \n \n6.  From 2005, the allocation for capital expenditure increased substantially in line with the \nambitious NPBED program to finance school construction and rehabilitation works, and provide \nequipment  and  furniture  to  upgrade  schools  across  the  country.

Projections. It is estimated that the public expenditure for basic education will increase \nby about 19% in the period from 2006 to 2011. Based on Ministry of Finance estimates for 2007 \nas shown in table A4.1, the projection is based on (i) an increase in GDP of 7% per annum for \n2008\u20132011, (ii) an average inflation rate of 8%, and (iii) the assumption that the share of public \nexpenditures on education in GDP will remain at 9% from 2008 to 2011. To extrapolate further, \nit is assumed that in 2008 and 2009 the share of basic education expenditures in total education \nexpenditure will remain at 56% to reflect the high capital investment under the NPBED. It is \nplanned that the major school rehabilitation program under the NPBED will be completed by \n2009 and the school development fund SDF will cease its activity subsequently. To date, \nprovisional  financial  projections  have  only  been  made  until  2009.  There  is  no  financial \ninformation for the years beyond 2009, although work is currently being carried out to estimate a \nbudgetary framework to ensure sufficient funding for operations and maintenance to sustain the \ninvestments made in school facilities under the NPBED. It is assumed that due to the drop in \ncapital investments after 2009, the portion of the basic education budget in the public education \nexpenditure will decrease to 42%, to the same average share as between 2002 and 2004. \nThese projections are shown in table A4.4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 4 \n \nTable A4.4: Projections of GDP, Education Expenditure, and Government Share \n  \n Item   2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \nGDP (SUM billion)   15,210.0  20,779.0  22,930.0  26,500.0  30,600.0  35,400.0  40,900.0 \nAverage Exchange Rate ($)  1,115.0  1,220.0  1,300.0  1,400.0  1,500.0  1,600.0  1,700.0 \nGDP ($ billion)   13.6  16.0  17.6  18.9  20.4  22.1  24.1 \nTotal Public Expenditure ($ billion)   3.1  3.6  4.1  4.6  5.2  5.9  6.6 \nPublic Expenditure on Education ($ billion)   1.2  1.38  1.65  1.7  1.8  2.0  2.2 \nPublic Expenditure on Basic Education ($ \nmillion)   631.0  775.0  952.0  952.0  1,008.0  840.0  924.0 \nADB Contribution to the Project ($ million)         10.0  12.0  5.0  3.0 \nGovernment Share in the Project ($ million)        8.0  3.0  1.0  1.0 \nGovernment Share in the Public Expenditure \non Education (%)        0.47  0.16  0.005  0.0045 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSources: 2007 figures are Ministry of Finance estimates; 2008\u20132011 figures are Asian Development Bank projections \nbased on Ministry of Finance data.  \n \n8.  Sustainability of the Project. The Government\u2019s contribution to the Project is estimated \nat $13 million (30% of the total project costs) over 4 years and mainly includes civil works for \nconstruction and rehabilitation of schools, and expenditures for O&M for schools in the three \nproject provinces. Under the NPBED, sufficient funds have been allocated through the SDF to \ncomplete the civil works of at least 700 schools in the project provinces that will be further \nupgraded through ADB financing. The Government also confirmed that sufficient funds will be \nallocated to cover expenditure for building maintenance of schools included in the Project, which \nis also reflected in the Project assurances. Assuming that the Project starts in 2008, project \ncosts for the Government during the project duration will be les than 0.5% of public expenditure \non education. Such project costs are insignificant and strongly suggest that project activities \nsupported by the Government are sustainable. However, there is need for caution in respect of \nthe proportion of government allocation for maintenance, which needs to be increased at the \nschool level to finance preventive maintenance expenditures. ADB is planning to further expand \nits analysis of education financing in Uzbekistan to provide concrete and feasible solutions to \nincrease efficiency of the sector. \n \n9.  In order to determine whether there will be sufficient funding available for adequate \nmaintenance of newly constructed and rehabilitated schools within the entire education system \nafter the NPBED is successfully completed in 2009, an examination was made of the estimated \nrecurrent budget for basic education based on recurrent budget in 2006 and the projected \nbudget for 2007 as shown in Table A4.3. The following discussion is arbitrary and is used to \nillustrate a potential scenario for the duration of the project. \n \n10.  Salaries. In 2006, about 90% of the recurrent budget was committed for salaries for staff \nexpenditure, and the Government budgeted 91.4% of recurrent budget into this category in \n2007. The Government is committed to improving the working conditions for teachers, and \nteachers\u2019 salaries have been increased substantially during the past 3 years. As indicated in \nTable A4.5, for the projection purpose, it is assumed that the new salary level will be maintained \nand salaries will increase annually by 8% from 2008 onwards to allow for inflation increases. \n \n11.  Office Supplies and Food Supplies. It is assumed that budget provisions for these two \ncategories will increase by 5% annually for the period 2008\u20132011. The same is applied for the \ncost category \u201cother expenditures.\u201d \n \n ", "Appendix 4  41 \n12.  Utilities. In 2006, the Government allocated SUM29 billion or about 4% of recurrent \nbudget to utilities; for 2007, SUM33.2 billion is budgeted. The utilities include electricity costs, \ngas, coal, water supplies, and sewage and waste removal costs. The Ministry of Finance \nestimates that, after the school rehabilitation program is completed in 2009, utility costs for the \nentire upgraded school system will increase by 14%. For 2008, an increase of 10% is estimated. \nFor 2009, a further increase of 14% is projected, and thereafter, an annual increase of 8% is \nprojected to allow for inflation. \n \n13.  Telecommunications. Telecommunications expenditures in 2006 were SUM0.7 billion. \nUnder the NPBED the Government provides computer classrooms to schools and plans to \nconnect all schools to the Internet. Assessments estimates that telecommunication expenditures \nwill increase in 2008 by almost three times, and thereafter as shown in table A4.5. \n \n14.  Building Maintenance. Starting in 2005, the Government has substantially increased \nthe  budget  for  recurrent  expenditure  for  building  maintenance  and  minor  repair,  and  this \nreached SUM10.5 billion in 2006 (Table A4.3). The major share of the budget for building \nmaintenance  and  minor  repair  is  allocated  through  the  SDF,  which  is  expected  to  cease \noperation after 2009. Although no budget information for the years beyond 2009 have been \nagreed upon, the Government is committed to providing sufficient funding for maintenance \nensuring that newly upgraded schools are preserved. Thus, the Government committed to \nproviding sufficient funding through the state recurrent budget. \n \n15.  Based on international experience and examinations of school infrastructure, the annual \nbudget for school building maintenance should be at least $30.4 million (about SUM38 billion) \nafter all rehabilitation work has been completed in 2009.5 Table A4.5 provides gradual projection \nof the required funding estimated for building maintenance.  \n \n16.  Outlook.  In  order  to  assess  whether  sufficient  budget  for  the  projected  increased \nrecurrent expenditures is available, the following projection was made. From 2002\u20132004, the \naverage share of recurrent expenditures in basic education was above 90%. With the start of \nthe  rehabilitation  and  construction  works  under  the  NPBED  in  2005,  capital  expenditures \nincreased  substantially.  Proportions  in  2007  shifted  to  30%  capital  expenditure  and  70% \nrecurrent expenditure. It is assumed that the share of the recurrent expenditure of the total \nexpenditure on basic education budget will be 70% for 2008 and 2009, to reflect the planned \ncivil works and upgrading activities. After the completion of the NPBED in 2009, it is projected \nthat the share of recurrent expenditure will follow the earlier trend and again reach 90%, which \nwill provide for increased funds for maintenance of school facilities. Projections are shown in \nTable A4.5. \n \n17.  The illustrated scenario indicates that sufficient recurrent budget will be available to \nensure adequate maintenance of newly upgraded school facilities. The projections do not take \ninto consideration community contributions in terms of participation in maintenance activities \nand  fundraising,  which  will  reduce  dependency  on  public  allocations.  However  caution  is \nrequired with respect to financing the rehabilitation of the entire school network which was \nestimated  by  Ministry  of  Finance  at  $1.2  billion  of  which  75%  will  be  financed  by  the \nGovernment. Supplementary to the contribution of ADB additional funding will be required to \naddress all capital investment needs. The Government will depend on external assistance to \nmeet future challenges in upgrading all schools in the country.  \n                                            \n5  The current average capital investment cost for the construction of a classroom under NPBED (taking into account \naverage cost-shares for ancillary spaces such as corridors, offices, and teachers\u2019 and library rooms) is estimated at \n$7,000. Based on international experience, the annual maintenance budget for a classroom should be at least 2% \nof its capital cost, or $140 per classroom per year.  Considering that the basic education system has a total of \n217,465 classrooms, the total budget for school building maintenance should be at least $30.4 million (SUM38 \nbillion) per year. \n ", "42  Appendix 4 \nTable A4.5: Projected Recurrent Budget for Basic Education \n(SUM billion) \n Item  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \nTotal expenditure on basic education  945.0 1,238.0 1,332.0 1,512.0 1,334.0  1,570.0\nTotal recurrent basic education   \n  expenditures   685.7 866.6 932.4 1,058.4 1,200.0  1,413.0\nSalaries and social charges  621.7 798.6 862.5 931.5 1,006.0  1,086.5\nOffice supplies   2.7 4.1 4.3 4.5 4.7  4.9\nFood supplies  19.1 19.8 20.8 21.8 22.9  24.0\nUtilities  29.0 33.2 36.5 41.6 44.9  48.5\nTelecommunications  0.7 0.9 2.1 2.4 2.7  3.0\nOther expenditures  2.0 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8  0.9\nSubtotal  675.2 857.3 926.9 1,002.6 1,082.0  1,167.8\nBuilding maintenance   10.5 9.3 25.0 30.0 38.0  38.0\nTotal 685.7 866.6 951.9 1,031.8 1,119.2  1,205.8\n    Sources: 2007 figures are Ministry of Finance estimates; 2008\u20132011 figures are Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n18.  Benefits.  Government  provision  of  basic  education  services  is  justified  because  of \nimperfect market conditions and lack of adequate private education provision and financing.6 \nFurther, the rationale to support public funding to promote rural basic education in Uzbekistan \nrests on equity justification. Disparities between urban and rural schools are apparent. The \nProject will contribute to improved learning opportunities for children in disadvantaged rural \nareas.  \n \n19.  The major beneficiaries of the Project will be about 670,000 students enrolled in at least \n700 schools to be upgraded in the three project provinces. In addition about 45,000 teachers \nfrom  schools  supported  by  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  from  improved  teacher  training \nmeasures. Further, communities in the three project provinces will benefit from schools that will \noffer after-school activities such as social events, learning and information programs, sport \nactivities, and hobby clubs. School board members will benefit from training courses, and school \nmanagements will benefit from fundraising and school improvement schemes.  \n \n                                            \n6 Credit markets do not provide loans to low-income families to finance their children\u2019s education.   \n ", "Appendix 5  43 \nCOMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN BASIC EDUCATION \n \n1.  Community participation in education is a promising concept for further strengthening of \neducation quality in Uzbekistan. During the Soviet period, parents largely left education to \nGovernment, as funding of school facilities was sufficient and education services in schools \nwere considered satisfactory; hence there was little need for additional parental and community \ninvolvement  in  school  affairs.  After  the  collapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  the  quality  of \neducation provision deteriorated, particularly in rural areas. Since 2004, the Government has \nstarted a comprehensive reform program and commenced a broad rehabilitation scheme to \nupgrade deteriorated school facilities. However, most schools in rural areas are still lacking \nsufficient recurrent funding to cover basic operational and maintenance costs. Parents and \ncommunities  recognized  this  issue  and  realized  the  need  to  provide  additional  support  to \nschools  to  meet  urgent  school  needs.  In  addition,  schools  started  to  face  new  issues  of \nstudents\u2019 absenteeism and dropping out resulting from a decrease in education quality and \npervasive poverty. The affordability of education presents challenges for many low-income \nfamilies, in particular in rural areas. With the commencement of each school year, families need \nto meet new costs including school uniforms, textbook rentals and payments for tutorials. The \nvast majority of villages lack venues that provide for learning and recreation activities for adults \nand children. Thus, more and more communities are exploring possibilities to utilize school \nfacilities as community focal points for organizing social events, sports activities, and training \nand information programs for young and adult community members. \n \n2.  The  Government  encourages  community  participation  to  improve  the  quality  of \neducation and strengthen governance and accountability in schools. The legal framework for \ncommunity participation is provided in the National Program on Personal Training (NPPT), the \nLaw  on  Education,  and  the  Regulation  on  General  Education,  all  of  which  promote  the \nestablishment of school boards and parental committees to increase public governance and \nensure greater transparency in decision making processes. In support of the legal framework, \nthe Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) developed the partnership concept of Family-Mahalla-\nSchool,  which  broadly  defines  roles  and  responsibilities  of  parents  and  other  mahalla \n(community) stakeholders to support the education process at the school level.  \n \n3.  The  Law  on  Education  encourages  community  participation  to  improve  public \ngovernance in education, and promotes creation of public governance bodies in educational \nentities. The NPPT promotes a life-long learning approach for all community members, and \nsupports the participation of parents, public associations, and mahallas, in education delivery. \nThe Regulation On General Education in the Republic of Uzbekistan was adopted by the \nCabinet of Ministers and underlines the need for close cooperation between schools, parents, \nmahalla  committees,  public  foundations,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The \nregulation  provides  the  legal  basis  to  establish  school  boards,  which  may  include \nrepresentatives of enterprises, public associations, mahalla committees, and parents. By a \nspecial decree issued by the Cabinet of Ministers, the financial autonomy of schools has been \nincreased substantially. Under the decree schools are allowed to generate and keep revenues \nfrom parental and community contribution and income-generating activities (off-budget income). \nFurther,  schools  were  given  a  legal  status  to  open  a  bank  account.  In  order to  establish \ntransparent mechanisms to operate off-budget funds at schools, MOPE developed guidelines \nfor school boards to monitor financial transactions. \n \n4.  In October 2005, MOPE approved a draft Regulation on Establishing Trustee Boards in \nEducational  Institutions.  According  to  the  regulation,  school  boards  may  include  up  to  10 \nmembers including parents, teachers, mahalla leaders, and sponsors. However, the regulation \n ", "44  Appendix 5 \ndoes not specify the representation ratio of each community group. Teachers are nominated by \nparents for board membership. A chairperson of the board and its members will be elected by \ngeneral meeting of parents for a 1-year period. The regulation stipulates that the utilization of \noff-budget resources needs the approval of the school boards. According to the regulation, \nschool boards have an advisory role aiming at providing guidance to (i) improve the learning \nenvironment for students, (ii) improve the working conditions for teaching staff, (iii) assist in \nlaunching  extra-curriculum  activities,  (iv)  improve  the  school  facilities;  (v)  attract  additional \nresources to support schools, (vi) mobilize support for students from low-income families, and \n(vii) organize recreation and learning activities at school premises for all community members.  \n \n5.  Partnership Concept of Family-Mahalla-School. In support of the legal framework, the \nGovernment introduced the Family-Mahalla-School concept to strengthen partnership among \nfamilies, communities and schools. The concept broadly defines the roles and responsibilities of \nthe  three  major  stakeholders  in  education:  school,  family,  and  mahalla.  Mahallas  are \nresponsible for (i) identifying and addressing education-related problems in the community, (ii) \nidentifying and supporting vulnerable families economically and morally, (iii) attracting sponsor \nand  donor  local  funds,  and  (iv)  assisting  schools  to  implement  out-of-school  educational \nactivities. Families bear the responsibility for (i) creating appropriate home conditions to support \nthe learning process of children, (ii) ensuring a healthy environment in the family, (iii) ensuring \nproper  moral  guidance  for  children,  and  (iv)  being  in  touch  with  teachers  and  school \nmanagement to monitor learning outcomes. Primary duties of the school, apart from providing \neducation services to students, is to (i) guide parents and young families on education-related \nmatters; (ii) provide pedagogical assistance to families with difficult children; (iii) coordinate \nactivities  of  educational  stakeholders  in  the  community,  and  (iv)  jointly  with  mahalla \nrepresentatives, organize social activities, sport events, hobby clubs, learning programs, and \nother measures for children and families.   \n \n6.  Success  Stories.  Although  the  practice  of  community  involvement  in  school \nmanagement has not yet been fully advanced in all schools in Uzbekistan, and the level of \nparental and community participation needs to be enhanced throughout the country, there are \nmany  successful  examples  of  community  participation,  which  include  (i)  improved  school \ninfrastructure  through  regular  repair  and  maintenance  works  carried  out  by  community \nmembers, and financial and in-kind contributions from parents; (ii) improved attendance rates in \nschools through active parent involvement in school affairs, which was initiated by awareness \ncampaigns creating a better understanding of the benefits of education for the future of their \nchildren;  (iii)  increased  support  for  students  from  low-income  families  in  terms  of  learning \nmaterial, food, clothes, cash provided by mahallas, and special support schemes; (iv) improved \nlearning environment through additional learning and reading materials and sports equipment \npurchased with community donations; (v) after-school activities such as social events, hobby \nclubs, and learning programs during nonschool periods (afternoons, weekends, and holidays) \nfor  children  and  adult  community  members;  (vi)  improved  governance  in  schools  through \nparticipation of parents in managing off-budget funds, selecting teachers for awards based on \ngood performance, identifying income generating activities, and preparing school improvement \nplans.          \n \n7.   Issues. Although, the existing legal framework encourages community participation and \npromotes social partnership, and about 65% of all basic schools have established school boards \nand parental committees, the level of active participation of community and parents in school \ngovernance is often weak and depends on the encouragement and willingness of the school \nprincipals.  Lack  of  awareness  and  knowledge  among  directors,  teachers,  parents,  and \ngovernmental officials about opportunities for, and benefits of, community participation in school \n ", "Appendix 5  45 \nmanagement was reported as another principal issue to establish active and successful school \nboards and parental committees. Field visits revealed that existing school boards have weak \ncapacity and skills to develop school improvement plans, identify income generating activities, \nand conduct fundraising, and as a result fail to effectively fulfill the tasks and responsibilities \nassigned to school boards. The lack of (i) monitoring mechanisms to review education quality, \nteacher performance, and learning achievements and (ii) transparent mechanisms to monitor \nand operate off-budget funds, are issues raised by community members and nongovernment \norganizations during the field visits. In addition, the responsibilities and operational procedures \nof school boards should be clearly specified in the School Charter1 of each school. \n \n \n                                            \n1  A regulatory document that defines school operation and is developed by each school and registered by the state \nauthorized body. \n ", "46  Appendix 6 \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROJECT OBLASTS (PROVINCES) AND RATIONALE \n \n1.  To focus the investments under the Project, the Government has selected three Project \noblast (provinces): Tashkent oblast, Surkhandarya, and Kashkadarya. Kashkadarya includes 13 \nraions (districts), Tashkent oblast has 15 raions and 6 towns, and Surkandarya consists of 14 \nraions. About 81% of Surkhandarya\u2019s population live in rural areas; the figure for Kashkadarya is \n75% and for Tashkent oblast about 61% (Table A6.1). Therefore, most of the population in these \nregions  is  engaged  in  agricultural  activities.  The  selection  of  the  three  provinces  has  been \nproposed by the Government based on poverty indicators as well as on the quality of education. \nWhile Kashkadarya and Surkhandarya are among the poorest regions of the country, Tashkent \noblast has a better situation in terms of the percentage of the population living in poverty. However, \nthe human development index (HDI)1 is lower in Tashkent oblast compared with other regions, and \nthe quality of education is suffering, as noted in the tables below. The Project will therefore benefit \ncommunities  suffering  from  both  poverty  and  poor  education  outputs,  hence  enhancing \nopportunities and quality of education.   \n \n2.  Socioeconomic Situation. Per capita gross regional product (GRP) in 2005 for all three \noblasts was lower than the average for the nation. Per capita GRP indicators are 84.8% of the \nnational average for Kashkadarya and 61.3% for Surkandarya. Surkandarya per capita GRP with \nSUM372,000 ($340 equivalent) is half the country\u2019s of SUM606,300 for 2005. Real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita reflected in purchasing power parity dollars still shows that Kashkadarya \n($2,140)  and  Surkandarya  ($1,792)  produce  less  regional  output  than  the  country  average. \nTashkent oblast has a per capita GRP of 99% as compared with the national average; however the \nHDI  in  the  region  is  deteriorating,  a  sign  of  growing  variations  and  disparities  among  the \npopulation. Rural areas, in fact, suffer the most, while urban areas benefit from proximity to the \ncapital city.  \n \nTable A6.1: Socioeconomic Indicators \n \n    Per Capita  Real GDP per  HD  Proportion of  % of Rural \nProject  GRP (2005)   Capita  (2004)   Index,  Population in  Population in the \nOblast  (SUM\u2018000)  (%)  (PPP $)  (%)  2004  Poverty*  Oblast, 2005 \n1.

More than 31% of the nation\u2019s schools are located in rural areas of \nproject oblasts, and about 25% of project rural schools are far from rural centers. Out of more than \n3 million grade 5\u20139 students in the country, about 27% are from the project oblasts. In the three \nproposed project provinces, upgrading of 820 schools was already completed by 2006. Table \nA6.2 provides an overview of number schools, rehabilitation activities, and enrollments.

Biology is taught to students beginning in grade 5; chemistry and physics classes start in \ngrade 6. However, data on the provision of science laboratory equipment to the 820 schools that \nhave been comprehensively rehabilitated in the period 2004\u20132006 in the three proposed project \noblasts, showed that only 209 schools have been provided with equipment packages for biology \n(out  of  which  69  schools  only  received  partial  packages),  222  schools  received  equipment \npackages for chemistry (72 schools were provided only with partial packages), and 225 schools \nreceived full packages for physics laboratory equipment.

By March each year a new batch will be submitted to ADB \n(the annual submission will allow schools still under rehabilitation or construction, and those due \nto  be  rehabilitated  or  constructed  in  the  future,  to  benefit  from  the  Project).  Only  newly \nconstructed schools and schools which have been comprehensively rehabilitated under the \nNational  Program  for  Basic  Education  Development  (NPBED)  will  be  considered  for  ADB \nfinancing under component 1.  \nA.  First Step Selection: Rehabilitated or Newly Constructed Schools \n2.  Based on the school mapping survey, and on rehabilitation plans to be financed under \nthe NPBED, the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) will prepare a preliminary list of schools \nwhich have been fully rehabilitated and newly constructed in the three project provinces and are \nhence eligible to be part of first batch of schools to be included in the Project. MOPE will ensure \nthat science laboratory and library rooms at schools are suitable to accommodate equipment \nand materials to be provided under the Project. The preselection of schools will meet the \nfollowing criteria. \n(i)  Only newly constructed schools and schools which have been comprehensively \nrehabilitated under the NPBED are eligible to be included in the list of candidate \nschools. \n(ii)  The candidate schools must have science laboratory and library rooms suitable \nto accommodate equipment and materials to be provided under the Project. \n(iii)  The candidate schools must be located out of the oblast (province) city and/or \ntowns. \n(iv)  The candidate schools must have not received any laboratory equipment, or \nhave received only partial equipment for the last 5 years, from an international \ndonor under the government-approved project. \n3.  MOPE  will  develop  a  list  of  preselected  candidate  schools.  Each  candidate  school \nthrough oblast and raion departments of education at MOPE will be officially informed and \ninvited to submit their school improvement plans.   \nB.  Second Step Selection: School Improvement Plans \u2013 Competitive Selection \n4.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, MOPE will establish a selection committee in \neach project province that will be in charge of actively communicating with schools included in \nthe preselection as for step 1, and review improvement plans received from schools. \n5.  Each  school  willing  to  participate  in  the  Project  will  submit  improvement  plans  for \nevaluation. The schools passing the review of the selection committee will be those meeting the \nfollowing criteria. \n(i)  Plans and evidence showing a commitment to efficiently utilize equipment and \nmaterials received under the Project. \n(ii)  Evidence of active community participation. \n ", "50  Appendix 7 \n \n(iii)  Plans for generation of funds to cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \nassociated with new equipment. \n6.  Schools will be evaluated based on the submission of school improvement plans. The \nproject implementation unit (PIU) will provide each selection committee with a draft form to \nguide  preparation  of  school  improvement  plans.  The  plan  to  be  developed  by  school \nmanagement together with school board and parents will provide the following information: \n(i)  inventory indicating quantity and  current condition of biology, chemistry, and \nphysics laboratories, teaching-aids, furniture, supplies and consumables;  \n(ii)  availability of teachers and laboratory assistants for each science subject and \ntheir qualifications;  \n(iii)  plans for integration of laboratory practice in the curriculum;  \n(iv)  planned learning and recreation after-school activities for community members; \n(v)  community participation in school life; \n(vi)  planned fundraising activities, and estimated revenues or in-kind assistance to \nsupport the O&M of science laboratory rooms and equipment; \n(vii)  plan to encourage students, teachers, and community members to maximize the \nuse of reading materials to be provided to the library; and \n(viii)  plans on (a) proper waste treatment, (b) training programs for students and \nscience  teachers  on  proper  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous  and  toxic \nmaterials and other safety measures in the laboratory, and (c) regular emergency \ndrills to prepare a response to fire and chemical spills. \n7.  Special attention will be given to community participation in school life and preparation of \nimprovement plans. The committees will hence evaluate that \n(i)  the school board is established and actively functioning at school;   \n(ii)  parents and community members constitute majority representation in the school \nboard; \n(iii)  parents  and  community  members  participate  in  the  development  of  school \nimprovement plans; and \n(iv)  the school board has initiated and implemented a number of school improvement \ninitiatives with the support of parents and community, such as (a) fundraising; (b) \nmaintenance  and  improvement  of  education  facilities;  (c)  organizing  social \nevents,  recreation  activities,  and  educational  programs  for  adult  and  youth \ncommunity  members;  (d)  arrangement  of  extracurricular  activities  for  school \nchildren; and (e) support measures for low-income families. \n8.  The selection committee from each Project region will review the plans. A priority list \nbased on final recommendations of the selection committees will be submitted to MOPE for final \ndecision, together with all School Improvement Plans received by the committee, The final \nselection of schools, equipment, and furniture packages for each school will be submitted by \nMOPE to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for further concurrence. \nC.  Terms of Reference of Selection Committees \n9.  MOPE will establish three selection committee (one for each region) within 3 months of \nloan effectiveness.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan:  \n \nThe close link between quality of education and reduction in the incidence of poverty and improving general living \nconditions is well established. In support of the Government\u2019s National Program for Basic Education Development \n(NPBED), the Project aims to improve learning development prospects and income earning opportunities of graduates from \nrural schools. This aim can be achieved through more equitable access to, and improved quality and relevance of, basic \neducation in rural areas in three project oblasts (provinces). The Project will contribute to the following social development \noutcomes: (i) enabling students and educators to participate more effectively in the knowledge-based economy by virtue of \nenhanced problem-solving skills, improved capacity to study independently, ability to work with information, and ability to \napply key skills in real job settings; (ii) upgrading facilities of selected rural schools through the provision of laboratory and \nteaching equipment, class room furniture and reading material; (iii) creating flexible mechanisms for teacher development \nengaged in rural schools to improve the quality and frequency of in-service training fostering student-centered teaching \nmethods; and (iv) assisting the Government in promoting community participation in school management to improve \nlearning environments for students and open schools for social activities and learning programs for all community members. \nThrough improving learning environments in rural areas, where poverty is prevalent, the proposed Project will contribute to \nimprove attendance rates of poor students. In opening schools to the communities for social activities and adult learning \nand information programs, the proposed Project will contribute to improved living conditions for all community members and \ndecrease the disparity in education quality between urban and rural areas. The overall impact of the project will be improved \nlearning development prospects and further education opportunities of graduates from rural schools. \n \nThe Project will complement the Government\u2019s strategic thrust of creating equal opportunities for all students. About \n670,000 students and 63,000 teachers will benefit from upgraded school facilities in the three project regions. Specific pro-\npoor measures of the Project include: (i) ensuring that all selected project schools are from rural areas; (ii) improve access \nto rehabilitated schools, new science laboratories, and upgraded libraries for rural students and teachers; (iii) enhance \nprofessional competence of rural teachers by fostering curriculum-relevant, student-centered lessons and learning activities \nfor specific subject groups; (iv) increasing community participation to support schools and poor students; (v) encourage \nschools to provide school facilities to local communities for adult learning activities, extra-curriculum measures, and social \nevents. Assuming that about 70% of students in rural areas enrolled in basic education belong to low-income families, the \nProject will contribute to enhancing income opportunities for the poor. In addition, at the end of the project, it is assumed \nthat at least 3,500 school board members and parents will have benefited from trainings under component 3. About 45,000 \nteachers for grades 5\u20139 will benefit from new teacher training programs. Approximately 1,600 school managers will benefit \nfrom training under the Project. Further, about 450 methodologists, administrators, and teacher trainers will benefit from \ntraining programs under component 2 and component 3.  \n \nThe Government considers reform of the current education system is an integral part of its social strategy, aimed at \nimproving access of the poor to income generating opportunities, and its approach to support steady economic growth and \ncreate equal opportunities for all by removing disparities between rural and urban regions and improve living conditions in \nrural areas. \n \nIn 2004, the Government launched the NPBED 2004\u20132009, which aims to strengthen basic education to meet international \nstandards and remove disparities between rural and urban schools. Under the NPBED basic schools are being rehabilitated \nand upgraded. By 2009, at least 8,476 schools should be covered under the NPBED, which includes almost 87% of all \nbasic schools in the country. The NPBED also provides funds for establishing incentive schemes to motivate and award \nhigh performing teachers and directors, improve in-service teacher training, and strengthen curriculum development and \nlearning assessments. \n \n \n \n \n ", " 66  Appendix 14 \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe World Bank Living Standard Assessment (2007) shows that an estimated 27.2%1 of the population, or 6.8 million \npeople, live at or below the poverty line. Of these, approximately one third, or 2.3 million people, are classified as extremely \npoor. Poverty is significantly higher in rural than in urban areas (29.8% versus 22.6%) and 69% of the poor and 72% of the \nextreme poor are found in rural Uzbekistan. Poverty is also associated with specific regions; it is thus relatively very high in \nKashkadarya and in Surkandarya. This is partly the result of environmental factors but is also because of a bias in public \npolicy that has allocated far more public investment, credit, subsidies, and other scarce resources to the urban areas while \nbroadly neglecting rural areas.2 \n \nAccording to the 2005 Government\u2019s Interim Welfare Improvement Strategy Paper (I-WISP), within each region, there are \nalso territories which are relatively better or worse off in terms of living standards. There are significant differences in social \nand economic conditions (availability of jobs, access to education and health care, and other social services) and living \nstandards between urban and rural areas.  \n \nA high proportion of the poor in Uzbekistan tend to be rich in human capital. Thus most have at least 9 years of education. \nThe  surveys3  indicate  that  poor  households  are  distinguished  by  the  following  features:  (i)  high  unemployment  or \nunderemployment, (ii) minimum educational qualifications, (iii) more than three children per family, (iv) reduced access to \nland of good quality, and (v) less integrated into the market economy. There is also a direct link between education level, \nemployment, and poverty. The families whose heads do not have secondary education are at the highest poverty risk.4 \n \nPoverty and social assessments were carried out to inform project design. They revealed the following: (i) inequality exists \nin education quality and access in the regions between urban and rural schools; (ii) the existence of barriers to fully utilizing \nin-service training opportunities for teachers from rural areas; (iii) the need for community involvement to address social \nissues in schools; and (iv) the need for local communities to utilize school facilities for additional learning opportunities and \nsocial events. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe main stakeholder groups are students, teachers, education managers (both administrators within the education system \nand policymakers), teacher educators, and designers of learning materials, teacher educators (both preservice and in-\nservice), school boards, parents\u2019 associations, and communities. The Project was designed through a participatory process \ninvolving key government stakeholders at the national, oblast, and raion levels. During the project design and preparation \nphase, stakeholders participated in number of meetings individually and in groups and provided their feedback for use in the \ndesign of various components. Focus-group discussions and individual interviews with stakeholders in three project oblasts \nof the country were held during the preparation phase. The project design also involved consultations with nongovernment \norganizations and other civil society organizations.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nDuring implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities. At the national level, the \nproject  will organize  workshops to develop understanding among relevant stakeholders from the Ministry of Public \nEducation, Cabinet of Ministers, the central teacher training institute, oblast teacher training institutes, and relevant \neducation administrations, on strategies to further improve and complement the current in-service teacher training based on \nexperiences gained at the pilot provinces and lessons learned from other development projects. The project will also apply \na participatory bottom-up approach by involving community members and school boards in school selection process under \nthe Project. Active community participation in school management and the design of after-school activities will ensure that \ntraining and social programs are demand-driven.  \n                                            \n1  Based on 2003 data. \n2  Corniaga. 2003.

Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nUzbekistan has made efforts to ensure that its inherited good education indicators are maintained. Universal access to \nbasic primary and secondary school education (grades 1\u20139) has been maintained, and the literacy rate is almost 100% for \nmen and women. According to the Household Baseline Survey (2001\u20132002) data, approximately 92% of men and 93% of \nwomen in the 25\u201334 year-old age group had some upper secondary or higher levels of schooling. The Interim Report on \nWelfare Improvement Strategy of the Republic of Uzbekistan (2005) showed that the enrolment rates between boys \n(90.9%) and girls (90.5%) are equal. However, the quality of education at all levels of education is not being maintained.  \n \nTo improve gender responsiveness, the Project will develop strategies for teacher training to address gender stereotypes in \ncurriculum and material development. The Project will ensure that girls and boys have equal access to all upgraded school \nfacilities and gain benefit from improved teaching. The project will also ensure equal gender representation in school boards \nand encourage both female and male adults to equally participate in school improvement, additional learning activities, and \nsocial events in communities. The improved in-service teacher training system, which is closer to schools and more flexible, \nwill benefit at least 31,500 women teachers who account for 70% of the teaching force in project schools, with far more \nwomen teachers in the school system to be benefited during the life of the Project. In addition other issues with gender \nimplications to be monitored include the analysis of education materials for gender biases and the stereotyping of women. \n \nA consultant with gender expertise will be recruited to develop a plan of action identifying specific activities, targets and \nreporting mechanisms for the implementation of the strategies listed above. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
