The  project  will  finance \nsubprojects  in  the  Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian  (Banten  province)  and  Ambon\u2013Seram  (Maluku \nprovince)  RBTs.  Project  interventions  will  (i)  enhance  hydrometeorological  data  and  analysis, \nmanagement,  and  institutional  coordination  for  managing  flood  risks;  (ii)  upgrade  and  develop \nflood protection infrastructure; (iii) improve watershed conditions to moderate runoff peaks and \nsoil erosion; and (iv) prepare communities to manage floods. The project will promote effective \nflood  risk  management  (FRM)  by  coupling  infrastructure  investment  with  supporting  software \nmeasures.  It  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the  government\u2019s  National  Medium  Term \nDevelopment  Plan,  2015\u20132019  (RPJMN)  sector  target  to  reduce  the  magnitude  of  economic \nand social damage due to floods.4  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nIndonesia is highly prone to flooding due to its climate and topography.5 Flooding, which \n3. \noccurs annually in most of the country, has been increasing in frequency, causing as much as \n$430  million  in  economic  losses  per  year.6 During  2003\u20132015  average  annual  flood  impacts \nhave  included:  1.58  million  people  per  year  affected;  223,000  homes  completely  or  partially \ndamaged;  and  168,000  hectares  (ha)  of  crops  inundated. 7 The  floods  sever  vital  transport \narteries  and  often  disrupt  access  to  ports  and  airports,  restricting  the  transfer  of  goods  and \nservices. In 2013, Ciujung river flooding affected 19,674 households, displaced 50,527 people, \nand  disrupted traffic  along the  Jakarta\u2013Merak  toll  road  that  connects Java  to  Sumatra  island.8 \nDespite its location in a drier region, in 2013 Ambon suffered from flash floods resulting in the \ndestruction  of  59  homes  and  damage  to  45  others;  and  10  deaths,  5  missing  persons,  and \n7,212 displaced people (footnote 8). \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  Flood \n\nManagement in Selected River Basins (Phase II) (TA 7364). \n\n3  Government of Indonesia, MPWH. 2015. Rencana Strategis Sumber Daya Air, 2015\u20132019. Jakarta. The plan calls \n\nfor a reduction by 200,000 hectares (ha) of the flooded area nationwide by 2019. \n\n4  Government  of  Indonesia,  Ministry  of  National  Development  Planning,  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n\n(BAPPENAS). 2014. Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, 2015\u20132019. Jakarta. \n\n5  Indonesia  experiences  two  main  types  of  flooding.  Long-lasting  river  floods,  which  are  often  influenced  by  tides, \ngenerally  occur in  large islands  with  large  river  basins  that  have  steep slopes and long,  flat, and low  floodplains \n(e.g., Irian, Java, Kalimantan, or Sumatra). Flash floods typically inundate small islands in eastern Indonesia that \nhave small and steep mountainous river basins. \n\n6  Centre  for  Research  on  the  Epidemiology  of  Disasters  -  CRED.

Geospasial. http://geospasial.bnpb.go.id/ (accessed March 2016). \n\nApril 2016). \n\n \n\n\fFlood  impacts  have  worsened  since  1980.  Deforestation  and  inappropriate  agricultural \n4. \npractices\u2014which result in erosion and increased sediment loads in waterways9\u2014 are reducing \nthe capacity of rivers to accommodate higher peak flows caused by intense rainfall. Expanding \npopulation  combined  with  inadequate  spatial  planning  and  land  management  has  led  to \nsubstantial  development  in  flood-prone  areas,  escalating  flood  damage  to  life  and  property. \nUrbanization,  and  particularly  associated  road  construction  and  surfacing,  reduces  the \nvegetated  area  that  would  normally  absorb  rainwater,  resulting  in  greater  peak  flood  flows.10 \nThe  government  agencies\u2019  ability  to  optimize  flood  management  capacity  and  effectiveness  is \nlimited  by  weak  hydrological  data  acquisition  and  management,  and  flood  forecasting  and \nclimate  risk  modeling;  and  the  lack  of  coordinated  decision-making  among  government \nagencies.  Insufficient  investment  in  and  neglected  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  flood \nprotection  infrastructure  accentuate  the  adverse  impacts  of  floods. 11  In  the  absence  of \nappropriate  awareness  and  preparedness,  communities  remain  highly  vulnerable  to  and  at \ngreater risk of loss of life and assets from more frequent and intense floods. \n \n5. \nClimate  change  impacts  include  the  increasing  frequency  of  intense  rainfall  and  rising \nsea  levels,  and  are  expected  to  further  exacerbate  flood  risk.12 The  impacts  of  intense  and \nfrequent  flood  events  combined  with  the  lack  of  economic  and  social  capital  to  manage  flood \nrisks further limit the ability of many river-based communities to escape poverty. \n \nWater  security  is  a  central  pillar  of  the  RPJMN,  which  promotes  FRM  to  reduce  flood \n6. \ndamage.13 Indonesia  adopted  the  integrated  water  resource  management  (IWRM)  approach, \nwhich is being promoted through (i) the establishment of river basin management organizations \n(RBOs),14 and (ii) the formulation of strategic basin plans as a prerequisite to basin development \nplans  (Rencanas).  The  Rencanas  form  the  basis  for  the  public  investment  in  water  resource \nmanagement with a horizon of 20 years, including flood management. Implementation of IWRM \nand participatory river basin management is still hampered by inadequate planning, investment, \ncapacity, and coordination. The RBTs targeted by the project are not an exception. There is a \ngrowing need to integrate structural and nonstructural measures to create a holistic response to \nthe flood challenge. \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  support  implementation  of  part  of  the  SPWR  calling  for  a  $3.06  billion \ninvestment  in  flood  management.15 The  Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian  RBT  (which  is  affected  by \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2016. Indonesia Country Water Assessment. Manila. About 78 million ha in Indonesia are degraded. \n10 Deltares et al. 2012. Java Water Resources Strategic Study. Report submitted to the World Bank. http://citarum.org \n/citarum-knowledge/arsip-dokumen/dokumen-perencanaan/540-java-water-resources-strategy-study/file.html.  The \nstudy estimates that, at current trends, the urbanized area in Java will double within 30 years. \n\n11  Requirements  to  finance  flood  protection  infrastructure  for  2015\u20132019  are  estimated  at  $74.6  million  in  the \nCidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian RBT and $102.7 million in the Ambon\u2013Seram RBT. During 2010\u20132014, only 60% of the \nplanned investment was realized. \n\n12 Climate  change  is  also  expected  to  produce  stronger  and  more  frequent  El  Ni\u00f1o  and  La  Ni\u00f1a  events  and  will \n\nexacerbate floods and droughts, thereby leading to increased food and water insecurity. \n\n13 FRM embraces a range of measures that address three key components: (i) managing flood hazard, (ii) minimizing \nexposure  to  flood  hazard,  and  (iii)  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  people  and  property  exposed.  Managing  flood \nhazard  involves  physical  modifications  to  water  flow,  such  as  river  infrastructure  works,  and  catchment \nmanagement  measures  such  as  controls  over  forestry  and  agricultural  practices.  Managing  exposure  to  floods \ninvolves  property  acquisition,  land  use  zoning,  building  codes,  planning  development  controls,  and  elevated \nbuilding.  Managing  flood  vulnerability  involves  nonstructural  measures  such  as  community  awareness,  flood \nforecasting and warning, preparedness, emergency response, and post-flood early recovery strategies. The FRM \nprocess allows these measures to be weighed against physical, social, and economic conditions; and addresses \nspecific issues that characterize each RBT. \n\n14 The central government is responsible for 63 RBTs, provincial agencies for 53, and district agencies for 15. \n15 The SPWR calls for an overall investment of $24.68 billion nationwide for water resources management. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\friver floods)  and the  Ambon\u2013Seram  RBT (which  experiences flash floods)16 have  been  initially \nselected  to  demonstrate  FRM  in  implementing  the  RPJMN.  The  investment  will  help  the \ngovernment accelerate implementation of Rencanas in selected RBTs, and provides (i) a long-\nterm  partnership  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government  for  policy \ndialogue  and  capacity  development,  and (ii)  the design  of  a future  programmatic  and systems \nbased approach to flood risk management in Indonesia. The project\u2019s outputs and sector targets \nare clearly linked, and the criteria for the sector modality are met.17 \n \nThe  project  builds  on  lessons  from  flood  management  assistance  by  ADB  and \n8. \ndevelopment  partners.  The  project  design  incorporates  key  recommendations  based  on  these \nlessons,  including  (i)  intensive  consultations  need  to  be  conducted  with  local  stakeholders \nduring  project  preparation  to  address  all  problems  and  issues,  (ii)  the  government  should \nroutinely collect and analyze flood-damage data, (iii) support is needed to design and develop \nsustainable long-term flood management concepts, and (iv) watershed management programs \nshould be implemented to enhance the impact and sustainability of flood control works.18 \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  (i)  the  strategic  priorities  for  the  Midterm  Review  of \n9. \nStrategy  2020; 19  and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2015  for  Indonesia. 20 \nAgriculture  and  natural  resources  (including  flood  management)  is  a  sector  focus  of  the \npartnership strategy. The project is aligned with the ADB water operational plan, which identifies \nflood mitigation (as part of disaster risk management) as one of the two urgent challenges to be \naddressed  in  the  IWRM  approach. 21  The  project  is  also  aligned  with  the  ADB\u2019s  plan  for \nintegrated disaster risk management as it will support the government and local communities to \nidentify and better manage risks from natural hazards.22 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe impact will be economic and social losses from flood events in selected river basins \nreduced.  The  outcome  will  be  flood  risks  in  selected  river  basins,  including  those  in  the \nCidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian and Ambon\u2013Seram RBTs, reduced through FRM. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nTo achieve its expected outcome, the project will have the following outputs: \n\n11. \n \n\n(i) \n\nPlanning  for  flood  risk  management  enhanced.  The  project  will  introduce \nmodern  technology  and  install  an  expanded  network  of  automatic  equipment  to \nbetter  assess  flood  risks  and  formulate  solutions.  The  project  will  support  the \n\n                                                 \n16 The  Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian  RBT  covers  an  area  of  4,125  square  kilometers  and  lies  mainly  within  Banten \nprovince,  the  westernmost  province  of  Java.  The  Ambon\u2013Seram  RBT  is  located  on  the  islands  of  Ambon  and \nSeram in eastern Indonesia\u2019s Maluku province, and has an area of 18,625 square kilometers. \n\n17 The  required  preconditions  for  the  use  of  the  sector  lending  modality\u2014sector  development  plan,  institutional \ncapacity,  and  appropriate policy  to  implement the  sector  development  plan\u2014are  all  in  place.  The  MPWH, as  the \nexecuting agency, has the capacity to implement the sector development plan in terms of identification, selection, \ndesign,  and  implementation  of  subprojects.  The  sector  development  plan  identified  sector  indicators  that  can  be \nmonitored and verified, including targets for cross-cutting and safeguard concerns. \n\n18  ADB.  2007.

This  will  be \ncomplemented by institutional strengthening, planning, and coordination in those \nprovinces and districts that will use FRMPs in updating provincial, district, and/or \ncity government spatial, midterm, and annual plans.23 \nLand management improved and flood infrastructure upgraded. This output \nwill  reduce  flood  hazards  through  a  combination  of  physical  interventions.  The \nproject will support RBOs to prepare detailed engineering designs (DEDs); meet \nenvironmental and social safeguards; conduct tendering and O&M planning; and \nimplement \nsocially, \nenvironmentally,  and  economically  justified.24 Flood  control  investments  will  be \nimplemented  in  conjunction  with  programs  that  will  reduce  sediment  transport. \nCommunities in middle catchments will improve selected degraded land areas by \nimplementing soil and water conservation measures to reduce soil erosion.25  \nCapacity for community-based flood risk management enhanced. To further \nimprove  flood  resilience,  community-based  flood  risk  management  (CBFRM) \ngroups  in  the  flood  plains  that  benefit  from  the  early  warning  system  will  be \nestablished,  strengthened,  and  engaged.  This  involves  raising  the  knowledge \nand  understanding  of  the  specific  risks  each  community  faces  specific  to  their \nlocation, and the possible mitigation measures that might be available to prepare \nthem. This will be focused on mitigating the adverse impacts of floods tailored to \nthe specific nature and scale of the risk of each community in each location.  \nPolicy,  coordination,  and  capacity  at  national  level  improved.  To  ensure \neffective  policy  and  planning  coordination,  the  project  will  support  independent \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  strategic  coordination  under  the  National  Steering \nCommittee for Water Resources. A national strategy and a set of guidelines will \nbe  prepared  to  institutionalize  the  FRM  approach.  The  project  will  support  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies to strengthen the planning, implementation, \nand management capacities of the implementing agencies. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $161.57 million (Table 1). \n\nD. \n \n12. \n \n13. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $108.7  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.

For  the  core  subproject,30 site  investigations  and  bathymetric  surveys \nhave  been  conducted  to  prepare  the  DED  and  cost  estimates.  During  project  preparation,  the \nproject  team  (i)  considered  a  range  of  technical  alternatives  and  their  technical  and  economic \nviability;  (ii)  reviewed  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  design,  specific  components,  and \noperational  modes;  (iii)  deliberated  ways  to  maximize  the  beneficiary  areas  and  communities \nand  minimize  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts;  and  (iv)  optimized  timescales  for \nproject  implementation.  The  project  inherently  supports  climate  change  adaptation  because  it \nwill  increase  resilience  to  flood  hazards;  specific  adaptation  measures  are  included  in  the \ninfrastructure  designs,  such  as  provision  for  increased  flows  in  waterways.  Furthermore,  the \ninvestment program includes nonstructural components for climate resilience that will (i) assist \ncommunities  in  improving  flood  preparedness  and  resiliency;  and  (ii)  assist  the  government  in \nimproving its policies and institutions, based on IWRM principles.31 \n \n20. \nThe  RBOs  have  the  capacity  to  supervise  and  coordinate  the  construction  of \ninfrastructure. During project implementation, O&M manuals for the civil works financed by ADB \nwill  be  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Directorate  of  Operation  and  Maintenance \nunder  the  DGWR  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  investment.  The  official  hydrological  data \nmanagement,  flood  modeling,  and  early  warning  system  software  suite  developed  by  the \nResearch Center for Water Resources under MPWH will be adopted to ensure consistency with \nDGWR\u2019s efforts to standardize systems nationwide.  \n \n21. \nLand  and  water  management  activities  to  be  implemented  in  the  Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013\nCidurian  RBT  by  DGAIF  are  based  on  proven  approaches.  Implementation  mechanisms  and \ntechnical specifications are described in the Ministry of Agriculture guidelines. CBFRM activities \nwill  benefit  from  the  Directorate  General  of  Regional  Development\u2019s  coordination  experience. \nSpecific  guidelines  will  be  developed  at  the  early  stage  of  the  project  to  provide  guidance  on \nselecting target communities and members of the CBFRM community groups. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  have  been  undertaken  on  the  representative  Ciujung \nsubproject.32 The annual economic benefit of flood protection on the Ciujung river is estimated \nat $6.19 million, with protection of buildings accounting for 93.9%. The value of protection of rice \nproduction has been excluded from the benefit stream (flood duration is less than 6 days).33 The \nprotection  of  the  area  under  fish  ponds  accounts  for  6.1%  of  total  benefits.  The  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  of the  subproject  is  estimated  at  15.1%,  higher  than  the  assumed  cutoff \nrate for economic viability of 12.0%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic viability of \nthe  subproject  is  highly  robust  with  respect  to  adverse  movements  in  the  values  of  key \nvariables, and assumptions relating to asset values. \n \n\n                                                 \n30 The core subproject consists of the construction of dikes along 11 kilometers of the Ciujung river, complemented \n\nby the construction of spillways and a retention basin. \n\n31 A  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  has  been  undertaken  for  the  Ciujung  river  basin  and  additional  due \n\ndiligence is planned for the future subprojects in the Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian and Ambon\u2013Seram  RBTs. \n\n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 It is assumed that an inundation of less than 6 days will not damage rice crops. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThe economic analysis includes only the costs and benefits for structural measures. The \n23. \ncosts  and  benefits  of  nonstructural  interventions  proposed  under  the  project  are  difficult  to \nquantify as they involve benefits and costs with nonmarket values. CBFRM measures tend to be \nlow-cost activities with high levels of benefit. Such complementary nonstructural measures will \nsignificantly  enhance  the  viability  of  subproject  structural  interventions.  The  financial  analysis \nconcluded that the required O&M budget level is assessed as highly affordable for DGWR, Balai \nBesar Wilayah Sungai Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian, and Balai Wilayah Sungai Maluku. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nAll ADB-financed procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Project  implementation,  procurement,  and \nfinancial management will be aligned with the government\u2019s standard operating procedures. The \noverall procurement classification for the project is medium risk (category medium).34 A financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that the pre-mitigation financial management risk level for \nthe project is substantial due to the complex implementation arrangements and risks associated \nwith internal controls, internal audit capabilities, and segregation of duties. There are shortfalls, \nsuch as the lack of experience with ADB project management for some implementing agencies, \nwhich will be addressed through training and support from the project management consultant. \n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  ADB's Integrity  Principles \n25. \nand  Guidelines  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  DGWR. 35  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26.  Mitigation and improved management of flood risks will benefit communities through (i) \navoidance of property losses and reduction in casualties; (ii) increase in agricultural productivity \nand incomes through improved water management; and (iii) reduction of economic losses from \nlivelihood  disruption,  and  improvement  of  health  and  sanitation  conditions.  Land  management \nand  CBFRM  activities  will  generate  employment  opportunities  in  the  community.  Civil  society \norganizations will support community engagement. The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming. Women will benefit from project interventions through increased engagement in \n(i)  prioritizing  flood  risk  reduction  measures;  (ii)  implementing  local  disaster  risk  management \nactivities; (iii) generating employment through small civil works and other project activities; and \n(iv) community disaster preparedness, including dissemination of flood warning. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nis  classified  category  B \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\n27. \nthe  environment.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  includes  procedures  to  ensure \npotential  environmental  impacts  are  avoided,  reduced,  and  mitigated. 36  Potential  adverse \nenvironmental impacts from the project are assessed to be temporary and insignificant, and can \nbe readily mitigated. The EARF and initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Ciujung core \nsubproject  have  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. 37  For  future  subprojects,  government-\napproved  environmental  impact  assessment  (AMDAL)  studies  will  be  accepted  as  subproject \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n34 Project Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 ADB. 2015.

The  project \n\nenvironmental impact assessments (for category A)38 or IEEs (for category B), provided they are \nprepared  and  finalized  in  consultation  with  ADB  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) requirements, as specified in the EARF. Upon incorporation of ADB\u2019s \ncomments  to  ensure  that  the  AMDAL  or  the  environmental  management  and/or  monitoring \nplans meet Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, the English version of the AMDAL will be \nsubmitted to ADB and accepted as the IEE or the environmental impact assessment. \n \n28. \ninvoluntary \nresettlement. Structural works will require LAR in rural and settlement areas. The resettlement \nframework  guides  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  for  structural \nsubprojects,39 in  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Government  Law  No. \n2/2012  on  Land  Acquisition  for  the  Development  in  the  Public  Interest  and  relevant \nimplementing regulations. A resettlement plan was prepared and concurred by the government \nfor  the  Ciujung  core  subproject.40 It  will  acquire  190.4  ha  of  land  and  will  affect  about  1,887 \nhouseholds  (5,760  people),  of  which  (i)  1,060  households  are  considered  vulnerable,  (ii)  93 \nhouseholds are to be physically relocated, and (iii) 1,208 households are to lose more than 10% \nof  their  productive  assets.  In  accordance  with  the  principles  and  implementation  mechanisms \ndescribed  in  the  resettlement  framework,  the  Banten  province  and  Serang  local  government \nbudgeted  for  the  implementation  of  the  social  component  of  the  resettlement  program  to \ncomplement the land acquisition activities and ensure better livelihood opportunities for affected \nand  vulnerable  groups.  Local  government  commitment  to  fund  and  implement  the  social \ncomponent  of  the  resettlement  program  will  be  a  prerequisite  for  ADB  financing  of  structural \nsubprojects to ensure that the project does not have the potential for significant adverse social \nimpacts, particularly on vulnerable groups that may be unable to absorb such impacts. \n \n29. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified category C (indigenous people do not live \nin  the  core  subproject  areas).  As  part  of  the  selection  criteria,  future  subprojects  will  exclude \nproposals that impact indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 41 The  overall  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLAR activities for structural \nsubprojects are delayed due \nto (i) a lack of engagement \nof subnational governments \nto support the social \ncomponent of the LAR \nprogram, and (ii) untimely or \nlack of funding for \ncompensation.  \nAllocation of resources for \nmaintenance of                          \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProvision of support for the social component of the LAR program by provincial \nand/or local governments will be confirmed during subproject selection as a \nprerequisite for investment. This will be translated into an agreement with DGWR that \nclearly stipulates roles and responsibilities of specific entities and funding \ncommitments. The subnational planning agencies will coordinate with agencies \ninvolved in social programs to ensure timely preparation, implementation of activities, \nand budget allocation. The land agencies and appraiser will be involved early in the \nLAR process. The project team will ensure that DGWR\u2019s budget includes an \nallocation for compensation in accordance with appraiser estimates. \nA long-term development plan for the hydrological units will be prepared as the basis \nfor resource allocation by the BBWS Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian and BWS Maluku to \n\n                                                 \n38 If a category A subproject is proposed, the categorization of the entire project will be changed to category A. \n39 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Resettlement Plan: Ciujung Core Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \n(i) equipment and \ninformation systems; and (ii) \ninfrastructure is inadequate. \nRisk management measures \nfor financial management,  \nanticorruption and \nprocurement are not \nimplemented. \nCommunity-based \ninvestments are \nunsustainable. \n\nMitigating Measures \nmaintain the improved hydrometeorological equipment and information systems. As a \nloan covenant, DGWR will ensure that funds for maintenance of ADB financed \ninfrastructure are allocated in line with O&M plans.  \nThe project team will coordinate with Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Institution for any \ndeviation from the agreed financial management and anticorruption risk management \nmeasures. Dedicated training will be provided by ADB and the project management \nconsultant to strengthen staff capacity in the implementation units on financial \nmanagement and procurement.  \nUnder DGRD\u2019s overall supervision, the provincial and district planning agencies will \nensure that community-based investments are continuously monitored. This will be \nreflected in the annual work plans of the involved local agencies. An asset and \nactivity registry will be developed as part of the GIS-based monitoring system. CSO \ninvolvement will also help foster improved, longer-term community engagement. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BBWS = Balai Besar Wilayah Sungai (major river basin organization), BWS = Balai \nWilayah Sungai (river basin organization), CSO = civil society organization, DGRD = Directorate General of Regional \nDevelopment, DGWR = Directorate General of Water Resources, GIS = geographic information system, LAR = land \nacquisition and resettlement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n31. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n32. \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$108,700,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Flood Management in Selected River Basins \nSector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  17  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n31 August 2016 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fResults Chain \nOutcome \nFlood risks in \nselected river \nbasins, including \nthose in the \nCidanau\u2013\nCiujung\u2013Cidurian \nand Ambon\u2013\nSeram RBTs, \nreduced through \nFRM  \n\nOutputs \n1.
