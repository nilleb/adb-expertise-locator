It will have four main components: (i) a regulatory framework \nand  fully  operational  quality  and  safety  system  for  agro-products;  (ii) \ninfrastructure and facilities for safe, quality agro-products; (iii) improved \nsafety and reduced health hazards from livestock waste through support for \ndevelopment of biogas plants by small livestock farmers; and (iv) project \nmanagement  support  for  effective  and  timely  implementation  of  project \ninterventions.  The Project will cover 16 provinces in Viet Nam that have \nsignificant fruit, vegetable, and tea production.     \n   \nRationale  Consumers in Viet Nam\u2019s major population centers require that certain \nquality and safety standards be met in the fruit, vegetable and tea products \nthey  consume,  but  poor  regulatory  management,  unsafe  production \nenvironments,  and  excessive  levels  of  agro-chemicals  and  fertilizers, \nincluding  application  of  pesticides  by  Viet  Nam\u2019s  farmers,  are  major \nhindrances to achieving the required standards. This will affect the long-\nterm  growth  prospects  of  these  crops  in  a  competitive  production  and \ntrading regime. Viet Nam has one of the highest input use rates among \ncountries in the Asia and Pacific region. In the absence of management \nand regulations, these high input levels are affecting product quality and \nsafety. In addition, unsafe disposal of livestock waste in densely populated \nareas has contaminated soils and the water used for agricultural products. \nConsequently,  improved  livestock  waste  disposal  and  promotion  of \ntechnologies  for  effective  waste  treatment  and  management  is  a \nprerequisite to enhancement of the quality and safety of agro-products.  ", " \n  These issues are not being effectively addressed due to the lack of a \ndomestic  \u201csafe  food\u201d  supply  framework  and/or  strategy,  and  will  have \ncontinuing negative impacts on the environment and public health if not \naddressed.  Increasing  integration  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  agricultural  production, \nprocessing and marketing with international markets makes it critical that \nimprovements in product quality and food safety be made, if Viet Nam is to \nmaintain and/or increase its international market share. Improving global \ncompetitiveness will require strengthening of the capacity of concerned \ninstitutions at all levels of government to address the following issues, all of \nwhich constrain further growth in the agriculture sector: (i) numerous small \nand fragmented agricultural production units, (ii) low product quality and \nsafety, (iii) inefficient marketing, and (iv) weak bargaining power. These \ncause  inefficiencies  in  product  marketing  and  input  procurement,  and \nincrease the costs to the Government and the private sector of providing \nagricultural support services.  \n \nThe Government acknowledges the urgent need to improve agricultural \nproduction and marketing quality and food safety to a level comparable with \nneighboring countries and trade competitors. The Government is gradually \nintroducing  measures  to  improve  the  performance  of  state-owned \nenterprises under the State-Owned Enterprise Law, but constrained access \nto  financial  and  other  resources  remains  a  serious  obstacle  to  the \npromotion of viable private business opportunities in Viet Nam.  \n \nThe proposed Project is consistent with the ideals of the Government\u2019s \nstrategies  and  policies,  including  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, which seeks to achieve middle-\nincome status for Viet Nam by 2010 through improvements in the quality \nand safety of agricultural and processed products that meet domestic and \ninternational requirements. \n \n \nImpact and  The expected impact is sustainable and equitable growth of the agriculture \nOutcome  sector  through  increased  livelihood  opportunities  and  improved  human \nhealth. The Project is expected to increase the agriculture sector\u2019s annual \naggregate  value-added  by  about  3.0%\u20133.2%  during  2016\u20132020,  and \nincrease agricultural exports by 12.3%\u201314.3% over the same period, in line \nwith the Government's 5-year socio-economic development plan. It is also \nexpected to contribute to a reduction in the poverty incidence in the project \narea from 19% to 10% over the same period.  \n \nThe expected outcome is quality and safety improvements in Viet Nam\u2019s \nagricultural  outputs,  which  thereby  meet  domestic  and  international \nrequirements. \n \n   \nProject  The Project investment cost is estimated at $110.39 million, including taxes \nInvestment Plan   and duties of $8.67 million.  \n ", " \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a loan of  \n$95.0 million (equivalent of 62.4 million special drawing rights) from its \nSpecial Funds resources to cover 86.06% of the total project costs. The \nGovernment will contribute $6.22 million, accounting for 5.64% of the total \nproject costs, of which $3.98 million is contributed by way of taxes and \nduties. The provincial people\u2019s committees in the 16 project provinces will \ncontribute $6.47 million, accounting for 5.86% of the total project cost, \nincluding $4.69 million in taxes and duties. Partner financial intermediaries \nwill contribute $1.35 million, accounting for 1.22% of the total project cost, \nto finance biogas loans to households. Beneficiaries of biogas development \ncomponent  will  contribute  $1.35  million  in  local  materials  and/or  labor, \naccounting for 1.22% of the total project costs. The ADB loan will have a \nmaturity of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of \n1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk. Interest charges on the \nloan are to be capitalized.  \n \n  Table 1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource    Total   Percent \nAsian Development Bank  95.00  86.06 \nCentral Government   6.22  5.64 \nProvincial People\u2019s Committees  6.47  5.86 \nPartner Financial Institutions  1.35  1.22 \nBeneficiaries (Biogas Development)  1.35  1.22 \n    Total    110.39  100.00 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nPeriod of  1 July 2009\u201331 December 2015 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \nAgency \n   \n ", " \nImplementation  MARD will be the executing agency (EA) of the Project. A central project \nArrangements  management unit (CPMU) will be established in the Agricultural Projects \nManagement  Board  (APMB)  for  overall  project  coordination  and \nmanagement. A total of 16 provincial project management units will be \nestablished  in  the  provincial  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment (DARDs) for local project management. The Department of \nCrop Production (DCP) will establish an institutional project management \nunit (IPMU) to implement activities related to institutional and regulatory \ndevelopments  on  quality  and  safety.  The  Department  of  Livestock \nProduction (DLP) will establish a biogas project management unit (BPMU) \nto implement a biogas development program. A credit line provided under \nthe Project will be administered by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and \nutilized  by  partner  financial  intermediaries  to  finance  eligible  household \nbiogas  investments,  which  will  be  carried  out  at  the  local  level  by  its \nprovincial  branches.  The  Project  will  open  one  first-generation  imprest \naccount to be operated by CPMU and one first-generation imprest account \nto be operated by the MOF to finance the biogas credit lines to partner \nfinancial intermediaries. A total of 20 second-generation imprest accounts \nwill be established, one for each of the 16 provincial project management \nunits, one for the IPMU, one for the BPMU, and one for each of the two \npartner  financial  intermediaries.  MARD  and  all  agencies  proposed  as \nimplementing agencies have adequate financial and management capacity \nand experience to implement the Project. These agencies are government \nbudget-spending units, with staff capable of using standard government \naccounting and financial management systems. APMB, DCP, DLP, and \nDARDs have implemented significant donor funded projects, including ADB \nprojects. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement will mainly be undertaken by the CPMU. Goods, works, and \nservices  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nConsulting  The Project will require a total of 208 person-months of consultant services, \nServices  including  60  person-months  of  international  and  148  person-months  of \nnational consultant services in the fields of (i) management of agricultural \nproduct quality and safety systems; (ii) policy, regulations and institutional \ndevelopment;  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iv)  applied  research  and \ndevelopment for agricultural product quality and safety; (v) risk analysis; (vi) \ncommunication  and  training  programs;  (vii)  social  development;  (viii) \nenvironmental  assessment;  (ix)  financial  management;  (x)  biogas \ntechnology;  and  (xi)  rural  infrastructure.  The  international  specialist  in \nagricultural product quality and safety management will act as the team \nleader. The consultants will be recruited through a firm following the quality- \nand cost-based selection (QCBS) process, with a 90:10 quality-cost ratio \ndue to the specialized nature of the Project, and in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n   \n   ", " \nProject Benefits  The Project is designed to support the Government\u2019s efforts to implement a \nand Beneficiaries  comprehensive legal and regulatory framework related to food safety and \nquality including the Law on Product Standards, Labels, and Inspection, \nOrdinance on Food Hygiene and Safety, and the national action plan for \nfood safety. The project area covers about 3.9 million ha of agricultural land \nwith  about  3.6  million  rural  households  (or  an  equivalent  of  18  million \npeople) in 16 provinces, where the rural poverty incidence is estimated at \n25.9%  compared  to  the  national  average  of  22.0%  (2005  data).  Main \nbenefits attributable to the Project will include:  \n(i) incremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through \nadoption  of  high-yield  and  tolerant  seed  varieties,  integrated  pest \nmanagement,  and  good  agricultural  practices.  An  estimated  6.5  million \nfarmers will directly benefit from the project interventions. The Project is \nalso expected to generate employment for about 1.4 million people involved \nin the post-production food chain for tea, fruits, and vegetables. As a result, \nthe Project will make significant contributions to rural poverty reduction in \nand outside the Project provinces;  \n(ii)  health  cost  savings  realized  through  safe agricultural products  (tea, \nfruits, and vegetables) and improved livestock waste management. It is \nexpected  that  significant  reduction  in  the  occurrence  of  food-  and \nwaterborne diseases will directly improve human health in the project area, \nincreasing labor productivity and reducing treatment and hospital costs;  \n(iii) cost savings from substitution of firewood, kerosene, coal, and liquefied \npetroleum gas for cooking and lighting. The Project will contribute to energy \nsavings among rural households as biogas produced by the digesters will \nserve as an alternative energy source for cooking and lighting. An estimate \nof 40,000 households will benefit from this alternative energy source;  \n(iv) use of bio-slurry, an organic fertilizer that is safer than artificially treated \nmanure.  Farmers  are  currently  using  artificially  treated  manure  that  is \nconsidered unsafe for water, air, and soil. Although no empirical evidence is \navailable on the incremental impact of bio-slurry versus manure on crop \nyields in Viet Nam, elsewhere bio-slurry has been claimed to be a better \nfertilizer than artificially treated manure; and  \n(v) reduced levels of water, air, and soil pollution as a result of biogas \ndigester installation and operations, because of improved management and \ntreatment  of  domestic  and  livestock  wastes.  It  is  estimated  that  the \nproposed  biogas  development  operation  will  reduce  carbon  dioxide \nemissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons per annum. \n   \n ", " \nRisks and  Risks that may hinder the expansion of opportunities to supply safe, quality \nMitigations  fruit, vegetable and tea products to the domestic and export markets are: (i) \nproducers of agro-products (i.e., vegetables, fruits, and tea) may not be \nfully convinced of the need to comply with national and international quality \nstandards; (ii) food safety scares related to Vietnamese agro-products in \nmajor domestic and export markets will affect demand; and (iii) promotional \nstrategies  may  be  unable  to  build  consumer  trust  and  confidence  and \nincrease  awareness  and  recognition  of  safe  agro-product  brands, \nparticularly  regarding  their  certification  schemes  and  logos,  because  of \nfrequent past food safety scares. These risks would render Vietnamese \nagro-products  unable  to  compete  with  foreign-produced  agricultural \nproducts in the domestic and international markets. The Project is designed \nto  reduce  these  risks  by  building  institutional  capacity  for  effective \nregulation and enforcement of food quality and safety standards. It will also \nstrengthen the capacity of agricultural production and marketing units along \nthe  supply  chain,  backed  by  certification,  promotion  and  an  intensive \ninformation, education, and communication campaign. The approach will \nfollow  internationally  recognized  hazard  analysis  critical  control  point \nprinciples to assure buyers that all commercial units involved in producing \nand handling safe, quality products are independently monitored and have \nan established record of supplying products that meet stringent food safety \nstandards.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  the  continued \ndevelopment and review of standards to meet requirements of international \nmarkets and the World Trade Organization. \n \nSuccessful  reduction  of  risks  to  agro-product  safety  and  health  quality \nthrough  biogas  development  will  require  strong  project  management \ncapacity and coordination at the provincial level between the DARDs and \nfinancial intermediaries. There is also a risk that the Biogas Development \nProgram  may  be  delayed  and  may  not  attain  the  target  of  40,000 \nhouseholds due to (i) an inadequate supply of trained masons to construct \nthe biogas digesters, resulting from a lack of interest in participating in the \nbiogas  development  program;  and  (ii)  failure  by  targeted  livestock \nproducers  to  avail  themselves  of  credit,  due  to  non-acceptance  of  the \nbiogas technology. To mitigate these risks, the Project will disseminate \ninformation on the Biogas Development Program and provide training on \nmasonry, both at the central and provincial government levels. Enhanced \nassistance from both the Government and the Netherlands Development \nOrganization in Viet Nam will support training for masons and households \nand dissemination of information on biogas technology. Support will also be \nprovided on the proper use and maintenance of biogas digesters. In order \nto  ensure  that  financial  assistance  is  accessible  to  small  livestock \nproduction units, the Department of Livestock Production and provincial \nDARDs will work with partner financial intermediaries to extend microcredit \nsupport.  \n   \n   \n   \n   ", " \nTechnical  Associated technical assistance (TA) will be provided to strengthen project \nAssistance  management and develop strategies and options for expanding the biogas \nprogram in Viet Nam. Part 1 of the TA will provide startup support for the \nProject, including oversight and capacity building. The oversight function \nwill  provide  advisory  support  to  the  Government  on  how  to  effectively \nimplement  and  monitor  project  activities  on  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural products and biogas development. Part 2 will provide a design \nfor an investment to expand biogas development, involving: (i) technical \ndesign of biogas plants of varying sizes for farm households and medium- \nto  large-scale  commercial  livestock  farms,  based  on  field  testing, \ndemonstration, and applied research activities; (ii) determination of credit \nfinancing options for different socioeconomic groups; (iii) determination of a \ngeographical  expansion  plan  and  strategy;  (iv)  design  of  a  practical \ninstitutional and management structure expansion of the biogas program; \nand  (v)  development  of  clean  development  mechanism  projects.  The \nestimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1.8  million,  of  which  $1.5  million  will  be \nfinanced under the Project, through an ADB grant, while $0.3 million will be \nfinanced by the Government to cover incremental administrative expenses, \noffice space, local travel, and per diem for counterpart staff. The TA will \nrequire 103 person-months of consultant services, comprising 46 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultant  and  57  person-months  of  national \nconsultant services. All consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance \nwith the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Individual consultants will be recruited for part 1, while a \nfirm will be recruited, using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure, \nfor part 2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nHa GiangCao Bang OF  CHINA\n7 9\nLao Cai\n1 6 10 Trang Dinh\nLai Chau 4 Bac Kan\n8 Tuye1n1 QuTahnagi Ngu1y6en Lang Son\nYen Bai\n2 Mong Cai\nSon La Phu Tho 12Vinh Yen 18\nDiePnh Buien3 HoVai eB5ti nThriHA N1O3I 1145 HaBi1a9c GHiaanig P1h7HonaCg aLmo nPgha\n22HunPgh Yue 2Ln3y Duon2g120\nThai Binh\n24\n25 Gulf   of   Tonkin\n26 Ninh Binh\n20 o 00\u2019N LAO PEOPLE'S 20 o 00\u2019N\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC Thanh Hoa\nThai Hoa PROVINCES\n27\nDien Chau 1.

Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Macroeconomic  Performance.  Fueled  by  surging  private  investment  and  strong \ndomestic  demand,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  economic  performance  has  been  among  the  best \nrecorded by Asian Development Bank developing member countries. The growth rate in the \ngross domestic product (GDP) averaged 7.7% per year over 2003\u20132008. This was equivalent to \nan annual increase in GDP per capita of about 13% (from $490 to $1,053) during the same \nperiod.1 The country\u2019s economic structure was also transformed, with industry, construction and \nservices displaying rapid growth, while the share of the economy represented by traditional \nagro-forestry and capture fisheries declined. Viet Nam has achieved greater competitiveness in \nkey  sectors,  and  expanded  its  exports  significantly.  The  private  sector's  contribution  to \neconomic activity is increasingly apparent, improving the prospects for further reforms toward a \nmarket-based economy.  \n3.  Reduced  Poverty.  Continued  and  sustained  economic  growth  helped  reduce  the \ncountry's poverty rate from 58% in 1993 to 19.5% in 2004 (measured in terms of the national \npoverty standard). However, the incidence of poverty among ethnic minorities generally remains \nhigh.  Various  social  indicators,  such  as  education  levels  and  infant  mortality,  have  also \nimproved,  as  reflected  in  an  increase  in  the  country's  ranking  in  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Program human development index.   \n4.  Changing Food Demand Patterns and Quality and Safety Concerns. Accelerated \neconomic growth has resulted in improved socioeconomic welfare, rapid urban development, \nand greater demand for food products with assured quality and safety. Urbanization has led to a \nrapidly growing \u201csupermarket\u201d subsector2 that sources high-quality agricultural products free of \nsafety hazards. Incidences of food poisoning from microbiological contamination and excessive \npesticide residues in vegetables, fruits, and tea (estimated to account for 30% of the total cases \nof  biological  [e.g.,  E.  Coli]  and  chemical  poisonings)3  have  raised  awareness  among \nVietnamese consumers, who are demanding that safer, higher quality agricultural products be \ndelivered through the food supply chain. This has resulted in opportunities for profitable \u201csafe \nfood\u201d enterprises for both domestic and international markets, and the Government\u2019s realization \nof the need for a strong institutional and regulatory framework for agricultural product quality \nand safety to enhance the country\u2019s competitiveness in the world market.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

A cholera outbreak in northern Viet Nam was directly traced to unsafe vegetables, \naccording to the Ministry of Health in Ha Noi. ", "2   \n5.  Role of Agricultural Growth. The agriculture sector grew steadily at 4% per annum \nduring 2001\u20132007, and contributed 20.4% to national GDP in 2006, despite generally weak \ninternational commodity prices.4 Crops constitute about 59% of total agricultural production \nvalue, followed by fish (19%), livestock (17%), and forestry (5%).5 The country maintained its \nlead in export of rice, coffee and fish, while exhibiting strong growth rates in the production of \nvegetables (6.2%), fruits (3.5%), and tea (11.8%), which contributed significantly to the growth \nin the country\u2019s agricultural exports.6 Amongst the Southeast Asian countries Viet Nam ranks \nfirst in tea production, second in vegetables production, and third in fruit production, led by \ngrowing small-scale and commercial agro-enterprises. The livestock subsector, which accounts \nfor about 17% of total agriculture sector value, has grown at an average annual rate of 14% \nover 2001\u20132006,7 mainly because of swine production, which comprises about 80% of total \nlivestock production.8 Most livestock production takes place in integrated crop, livestock, and \nfishpond systems, with some 40% of households practicing both livestock and vegetables.9 \n \n6.  Agricultural growth in the past decade, particularly in the crop subsector, has resulted \nfrom: (i) market-oriented economic policies that supported progressive decontrol of prices and \nmarket  functions,  and  established  liberalized  land-use  rights  with  increased  household \nparticipation in production and marketing; (ii) increased public investment in irrigation and farm-\nto-market infrastructure; and (iii) intensive use of inputs such as land, labor and agro-chemicals. \nThe policy shift away from rice monoculture has led to increased production and export of other \ncrops, including fresh and processed vegetables, fruits, and tea, and the trend is expected to \ncontinue with increased integration of the country\u2019s economy in the world markets through the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and regional free trade agreements. Poor agro-product quality \nand safety are key obstacles to tapping expanding domestic and international markets for \nvegetables,  fruits  and  tea,  however,  warranting  investment  in  capacity  development, \ninfrastructure and training support for farmers, processors and agribusiness enterprises. \n \n7.  The  Government  recognizes  that  continued  agricultural  growth  depends  on  both  (i) \ndiversified farming systems appropriate for varied agro-ecological conditions; and (ii) more \nlocally driven improvements in competitiveness, quality and safety, and addition of value to \nagro-products. The Government has aimed to (i) promote production and processing of high-\nvalue products; (ii) improve agricultural research, extension, and market information services; \n(iii) intensify efforts to ensure better product quality and food safety based on sound agricultural \npractices;  and  (iv)  promote  competitive  business  and  agro-based  products.  The  proposed \nProject is consistent with Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty, promote livelihoods and \nimprove  living  conditions  through  interventions  that  will  enhance  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural  products  and  generate  multiple  environmental,  economic,  and  social  benefits \nthrough biogas development.

Manila. ", "  3 \nresponsible  for  policy  formulation,  management,  monitoring,  inspection,  communication, \naccreditation, and development of standards for food safety (Appendix 3). Existing quality and \nsafety  standards  for  agricultural  products,  especially  fruits  and  vegetables,  do  not  meet \ninternationally recognized standards,10 and pose significant risks to consumers. The absence of \na  well-developed  system  of  quality  and  safety  certification  for  agro-products,  continued \nagricultural production in unsafe or unsuited areas,11 and other similar practices further limit the \nquality and safety of the food products supplied to domestic and international markets. Farmers, \nprimary processors, and traders are unaware of food safety hazards as well as techniques to \naddress consumer concerns regarding food safety. The small size of farms and fragmented \nlandholdings constrain economies of scale in safe production practices, as well as investment in \nagri-business and postharvest facilities to make safe food part of the market chain. Increased \ngovernment  efforts  to  promote  commercial  values  in  the  agricultural  product  supply  chain \n(particularly for vegetables, fruits, and tea)  require more than simply an overall strategy to \nenhance competitiveness by improving access by farmers, primary processors, and traders to \nimproved production and postharvest technologies and more efficient marketing. Higher quality \nand safety standards for agricultural products are also needed, and can be developed by \nproviding services and access to financial assistance to small and medium-scale enterprises, \nand through the creation of safe agricultural zones (SAZs).12  \n \n9.  Rapid development of urban areas has altered the structure of agricultural production \nfrom monoculture to diversified farming, and resulted in competition for differing land uses. Peri-\nurban vegetable production near major cities or heavily populated and industrialized areas13 has \nraised concerns regarding the need for development of SAZs that are free from excessive \nmicrobiological, chemical, and heavy metal pollution and contamination. Creation of SAZs will \nremove obstacles to the production and distribution of safe, high quality agricultural products \n(including vegetable, fruit, and tea products). Demand for these products is rising rapidly, driven \nby increasing incomes and development of high-value domestic and foreign urban markets. \n \n10.  Reducing Food Safety Risks from Agro-chemicals and Animal Wastes. High levels \nof agro-chemical residues in vegetables, fruits, and tea have been recognized as a major threat \nto food safety,14 and 75% of fruits (oranges, grapes, and mangos) and 15%\u201330% of beans and \nleafy vegetables have excessive pesticide levels.15 Viet Nam has one of the highest chemical \ninput use rates among countries in Asia and the Pacific.16 Untreated disposal of livestock waste \nin  densely  populated  areas  has  contaminated  soils  and  water,  resulting  in  substandard \nagricultural products, in terms of safety and quality. Each year an estimated 73 million tons of \nlivestock waste are disposed of improperly into ponds, channels, and sewers, or left in fields, \neventually polluting the surrounding areas. Wastewater samples taken from livestock farms \nindicated that about 90% do not meet the applicable industrial wastewater discharge standards, \n                                                 \n10 Ministry of Trade and European Union. 2005.

Use of improved technologies such as bio-digesters can control environmental \npollution, thereby reducing risks associated with the use of agricultural products. Bio-digesters \ncan  also  provide  an  alternative  source  of  household  energy,  and  serve  as  a  safe  and \neconomical source of organic manure for crop production. By better managing agro-chemical \nuse and integrating animal waste management, safety risks associated with the on-farm use of \nagricultural products can be reduced. \n \n11.  Market-Driven  Food  Safety  Standards.  Establishment  of  a  \u201csafe  food\u201d  supply \nframework and/or strategy is a prerequisite to the creation of a role for the private sector and \nmarket forces in ensuring higher and stricter quality and safety standards for food, as demanded \nby conscious consumers in both domestic and international markets. Likewise, support has to \nbe provided to build capacity for and improve the efficiency of production, product assembly, \nand marketing and distribution by numerous small and fragmented agricultural production units, \nin order to be competitive while meeting the demand for product quality and safety standards.  \n \n2.  Government Objective and Strategy \n \n12.  Strengthening  of  the  Regulatory  Framework.  Accession  to  the  WTO  in  2006 \naccelerated implementation of the country\u2019s action programs that will streamline the over 200 \nfood safety regulations that have already been decreed. Establishment of a comprehensive \nregulatory framework is high priority under the action plan for food safety, 2008\u20132012, which \nincludes  (i)  establishment  of  a  lead  agency  for  food  safety;  (ii)  planning  of  SAZs;  (iii) \nstrengthening of certification, inspection, and monitoring; and (iv) improving food quality and \nsafety services (Supplementary Appendix B).19 The Government initially aims to ensure that \n50% of Viet Nam\u2019s standards conform with international food quality and safety standards. In \naddition, the capacity of accreditation organizations such as the Department of Crop Production \n(DCP) and the provincial departments of agriculture and rural development offices (DARDs) will \nneed to be strengthened, as staff lack sufficient background on food safety, accreditation, and \ncertification. The Government\u2019s monitoring and inspection systems will need to be improved \nalong with the capacity of the monitoring and inspection staff. Laboratory facilities and staff \ncapacity  will  need  to  be  upgraded  to  extend  support  at  the  regional  and  local  levels. \nCoordination between MARD and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in quality and safety inspection \nactivities, which is currently limited, will likewise need to be strengthened. \n \n13.  Good Agricultural Practices. Government agencies are promoting good agricultural \npractices (GAP) among producers, processors, and traders through Viet Nam good agricultural \npractices (VIETGAP) and Global Good Agricultural Practices (GLOBALGAP).20 However, the \nachievement of GAP targets is impeded by: (i) a lack of understanding of food safety among \nprimary producers, processors, distributors, consumers, and public servants; (ii) weak linkages \n                                                 \n17  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. 2008.

", "  5 \nbetween technical knowledge and extension services and farmers; (iii) inadequate revenue \nresources for monitoring, supervision, and field demonstrations of vegetables, fruits and tea; (iv) \nsmall and fragmented production units, with farmers that operate individually, with little incentive \nfor adopting VIETGAP; (v) lack of a regulatory framework to facilitate domestic adoption of and \ncompliance  with  international  food  safety  standards,  and  a  lack  of  clarity  regarding  which \nagency is responsible for public sector crop inspection and certification; (vi) limited capacity of \ntesting laboratories, including a shortage of qualified staff and funds; and (vii) unclear laws and \nregulations regarding penalty enforcement, and failure to enforce penalties.  \n \n14.  Creation  of  Safe  Agricultural  Zones.  A  major  element  of  the  Government\u2019s  food \nagriculture strategy is to safeguard agricultural land from excessive microbiological, chemical, \nand heavy metal pollution and contamination and ensure the production and distribution of \nagricultural products that are safe and of high quality.  Creation of SAZs will ensure that: (i) farm \nagro-production practices avoid food safety risks, (ii) production activities are organized and \nefficiently linked with processing and marketing, (iii) investments in processing and marketing \ninfrastructure result in greater efficiency, and (iv) the climate encourages greater investments by \nfarmers and agribusiness.21 \n \n15.  Improving  Livestock  Waste  Management  to  Reduce  Agro-Product  Safety  and \nHealth Hazards. The Government initiated its national biogas program in 2003.22  The program \nhas the potential to both (i) address the adverse impacts of traditional livestock waste disposal \nmethods on the physical environment (particularly, water, soil, and air) and, consequently, on \nthe quality and safety of agricultural products; and (ii) develop alternative and clean energy \nsources. The program was envisioned to mitigate and avert further environmental pollution, and \nhas achieved nationwide success mainly due to: (i) a well-established legal framework for \nprogram implementation and cooperation among relevant government agencies, participating \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and private organizations; (ii) availability of appropriate \nbiogas technology for small-scale livestock producers; and (iii) extensive training and promotion. \nA total of 45,000 biogas plants have been constructed in 30 provinces during 2003\u20132007; as a \nresult of increasing demand for biogas technology among small farm households, a second \nphase is being implemented (through 2011). Given the wider prospects for biogas, it is crucial \nthat further investments in demonstration and applied research for the design and viability of \nvarious sizes of biogas plants be made, particularly for plants of medium to large size. \n \n16.  Broadening the Framework for Food Security. An integrated approach to production, \ntrade and marketing that also ensures access by consumers to sufficient and safe food will help \nsupport economic growth and rural livelihood development. The Government is committed to \ndevelop  a  functioning  regulatory  framework  that  involves  partnership  among  producers, \nprocessors and traders as well as coordination and communication among relevant government \nregulatory and monitoring and coordinating agencies, such as MARD, MOH, Ministry of Trade \nand Commerce, and Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. The approach requires a \nstrong synergy between interventions that address the institutional management, regulatory \ncapacity, infrastructure, and training needs of public and private sector stakeholders for quality \nand  safety  enhancement  of  agricultural  products  with  those  that  would  (i)  create  safer \nproduction  and  processing  zones  for  specific  commodities  or  commodity  groups;  and  (ii) \nimprove the biophysical environment in which agricultural products are produced, processed, \nand traded. Creation of SAZs and improved management of fertilizer and pesticide use\u2014\n                                                 \n21  A description of the SAZs is presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n22  The Biogas Program for the Animal Husbandry Sector in Viet Nam, supported by the Government of the \nNetherlands\u2019  official  development  assistance,  is  being  implemented  by  the  MARD  Livestock  Production \nDepartment, with technical support from the Netherlands Development Organization in Viet Nam (SNV).  \n   ", "6   \nthrough  measures  such  as  integrated  pest  management  (IPM)  and  pricing  policies  for \nagrochemicals\u2014can eliminate the risk of microbiological, chemical and heavy metal pollution \nand contamination in food products. Likewise, introduction of technologies such as biogas can \nreduce environmental pollution and food safety risks while also providing a safe and economic \nsubstitute  and/or  complement  to  chemical  fertilizers,  and  an  alternative  energy  source  for \ncooking and generating electricity for lighting, thereby contributing to broader benefits, including \nincreased agricultural productivity, reduced health risks for women, and enhanced food security. \n \n  3.  Legal and Institutional Framework for Quality and Safety Enhancement  \n \n17.  The Government acknowledges the urgent need to improve quality and food safety in \nagricultural production and marketing to levels comparable with neighboring countries and trade \ncompetitors. In recent years there have been numerous regulatory efforts in Viet Nam related to \nfood safety and quality, in the form of ordinances, laws, standards, and action plans, which  \nculminated in the Government\u2019s directive proclaiming 2008 as the year of quality and safety of \nagricultural products. On 28 January 2008, MARD established the National Agro-forestry and \nFisheries Quality Assurance Department (NAFIQAD). NAFIQAD was given wide responsibility \nfor formulation and implementation of regulations, and will be guided by the newly developed \nfood safety and agricultural health action plan.23 There is also strong commitment from the \nprovincial DARDs to strengthen their capacity to implement quality and safety improvement \nprojects, in partnership with the private sector.24  \n \n18.  The  Government  has  developed  strategies  for  sustainable  development  and \nenvironmental protection that support these regulatory efforts and reform initiatives, including (i) \nthe Sustainable Development Strategy (Viet Nam Agenda 21) for harmonization of economic, \nsocial, and environmental development, which is a general framework to shift Viet Nam towards \na sustainable development path; and (ii) the national strategy for environment protection (2010\u2013\n2020), which aims to halt the spread of pollution, restore degraded areas, improve overall \nenvironmental quality, and ensure achievement of sustainable national development. These are \ncomplemented by the renewable energy action plan of the Ministry of Industry which has a \nfocus that includes the development of renewable energy sources, with priority given to biogas \ndevelopment as an efficient energy source for rural and mountainous areas. The Project is \nconsistent with the ideals of these strategies and policies. It is also in line with the SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010, which is intended to guide Viet Nam to middle-income nation status by late 2010 through \nimproved quality and safety of agricultural and processed products that meet domestic and \ninternational requirements. \n \n19.  The Government has identified 16 provinces25 that constitute major vegetable, fruit, and \ntea  production  areas  (Map)  as  the  main  targets  for  enhancing  the  quality  and  safety  of \nagricultural products.26 A large number of small farm households in these areas also raise \nlivestock for a living and are in dire need of appropriate livestock waste management and \ndisposal facilities. The poorly managed disposal of livestock waste is a major cause of pollution \nof both water and the production environment, and affects the safety of vegetable products, with \n                                                 \n23  See also the Prime Minister\u2019s directive on the implementation of urgent methods to assure food hygiene and safety \nNo. 06/2007/CT-TTg, dated 28 March 2007. \n24 The Government is now gradually introducing measures to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises \nunder the state-owned enterprises law to further liberalize markets for improved private sector participation. \n25  The selected provinces are (i) Bac Giang, (ii) Ben Tre, (iii) Binh Thuan, (iv) Da Nang, (v) Ha Noi, including Ha Tay, \n(vi) Hai Duong, (vii) Hai Phong,  (viii) Ho Chi Minh City, (ix) Lam Dong, (x) Ninh Thuan, (xi) Phu Tho, (xii) Son La, \n(xiii) Thai Nguyen, (xiv) Tien Giang, (xv) Vinh Phuc, and (xvi) Yen Bai. \n26 ADB 2007.

A detailed description of the \nproject area and criteria for the selection of provinces covered under the Project are presented \nin Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n  4.  ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy \n \n20.  The  key  challenges  to  be  addressed  in  Viet  Nam  are  identified  by  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy  and  program  (2007\u20132010)27  as  (i)  development  and  strengthening  of  institutional \ncapacity, (ii) promotion of socially equitable and balanced development, and (iii) sustainable \nenvironmental management. Promotion of sustainable rural livelihoods and control of pollution \nemanating from farming activities are among the high priority areas for support. The Project is \nconsistent  with  this  strategy  and  will  contribute  to  poverty  alleviation  and  environmental \nmanagement objectives in Viet Nam. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s mission and vision being \npursued under its long-term strategy framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) which focuses on \ninclusive growth and environmentally sustainable development while remaining dedicated to \npoverty reduction.28 \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy in Viet Nam has been to improve agriculture growth to \nreduce poverty. A combination of program and project financing have supported (i) reform of \nsector  institutions  and  administration;  and  (ii)  strengthening  of  (a)  research  and  extension \ninfrastructure, (b) human resources capacity and service delivery mechanisms for improved \nproductivity, and (c) rural roads and transport infrastructure to provide increased linkages to \nmarkets. Increases in farm income and in the value of agricultural production were targeted \nthrough  tea  and  fruit  development,29  while  the  agriculture  sector  development  program30 \npursued policy and institutional reforms to develop an environment conducive to market-based \nagricultural and agro-industry development. Making Markets Work Better for the Poor (2003\u2013\n2007),  a  grant  cofinanced  by  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United \nKingdom  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  enhanced \nunderstanding  of  links  between  growth  and  poverty  and  the  dynamics  of  markets  and \ninstitutions.31 The ongoing Agriculture Science and Technology Project (2007\u20132012),  aims to \nimprove  and  modernize  the  country\u2019s  agriculture  science  and  technology  systems  and \ninstitutions, as well as the capacity of their staff, researchers, and other stakeholders.32 The \nCentral Region Rural Infrastructure Project33 is increasing the connectivity of rural hinterlands \nwith markets and urban population centers, and thereby supporting enhancement of product \nvalues. The Project will (i) ensure sustainability in agricultural growth by preparing farmers, \nprocessors, and traders to supply safe products; (ii) provide benefits to health, living standards \nand  quality  of  life  (especially  for  women)  through  the  introduction  of  household  biogas \nproduction; and (iii) improve livelihoods, living conditions, and human health.

Manila. \n   ", "8   \ndemonstrate that integrated biogas development will enable households to generate higher \npositive social, economic and environmental benefits, and broaden rural development.34  \n \n  5.  External Assistance \n \n22.  Strategic  partnerships  with  other  development  partners  have  enhanced  market \nliberalization-related reforms and helped Viet Nam transition smoothly from a centrally planned \nproduction system to a production-marketing system dominated by farmers and agribusiness \nenterprises.35 TA and loan projects extended to Viet Nam\u2019s agriculture sector have supported (i) \ncapacity  strengthening  of  public  and  private  sector  institutions  that  provide  services  and \ninfrastructure  to  small  and  medium-sized  farms  (World  Bank  loan);  (ii)  improving \ncompetitiveness, entrepreneurship, and organization of farmers in the central region (World \nBank loan); (iii) improving food safety, farm product value, and trade development (Canadian \nInternational Development Agency grant); (iv) capacity building of MARD and improvement of \nthe quality and safety of fisheries products (Danish International Development Agency grant); \n(v) increasing productivity and competitiveness of agriculture and rural enterprises through \nimproving agricultural research and development (AusAID grant); (vi) strengthening market \nlinkages and capacity in agriculture and sustainable peri-urban agriculture (International Fund \nfor Agricultural Development, Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique \npour le Development, and Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center grant); (vii) \nimproving government capacity for pest risk analysis and export certification (World Health \nOrganization, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and New Zealand Agency for \nInternational  Development  grant);  and  (viii)  biogas  development  (Netherlands  General \nInternational Cooperation grant). International private investments, accompanied by technical \nsupport,  also  enabled  a  small  but  growing  number  of  SME  production  and  processing \nenterprises to achieve international standards certification required by the investors\u2019 export \n \nmarkets. A list of relevant externally assisted projects is in Appendix 4. \n \n  6.  Lessons  \n \n23.  Lessons from previous projects indicate that the participation of key stakeholders in \nproject  design  and  implementation,  in  subproject  selection,  and  in  the  identification  of \ninterventions are key success factors. Projects that seek to improve agricultural production and \nmarketing performance require strong linkages between research and extension, and client \ndemand and participation. The participatory and client-driven approach strengthens stakeholder \nownership of the project, and helps ensure that the needs of the private sector (including \nfarmers)  regarding  improvements  in  agricultural  production  and  marketing  techniques  are \nproperly addressed. Other lessons indicate that (i) strengthening of current commercial capacity \nand market linkages is essential to improving efficiency along the agricultural product value \nchain; (ii) quality is primarily set by markets and consumers, and high quality standards ensure \ncompetitiveness and profitability; (iii) consumer confidence in food safety relies on the quality \nand safety measures established within each link of the production-marketing chain; (iv) it \nrequires 2\u20133 years to develop the capacity to commercially produce certified safe and quality \nagro-products; and (v) a pilot approach involving \u201clead\u201d or \u201cinnovative\u201d farmers and the private \nsector reduces management risk and allows prospective investors and other farmers to assess \nthe potential for new investments and learn from firsthand experiences. \n                                                 \n34 A similar experience can be found in ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Waste \nProject. Manila. \n35 As of 31 December 2007, ADB had provided 21 loans to Viet Nam for agriculture, irrigation, fisheries, and rural \ndevelopment, amounting to about $922 million, or 26% of all loans to the country (which total about $3.4 billion). ", "  9 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n24.  The  expected  impact  is  sustainable  and  equitable  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector \nthrough increased livelihood opportunities and improved human health. During 2016\u20132020, the \nProject is expected to contribute to increase the agricultural sector\u2019s annual aggregate value-\nadded  by  about  3.0%\u20133.2%,  and  agricultural  exports  by  12.3%\u201314.3%,  in  line  with \nGovernment\u2019s SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n25.  The expected outcome is quality and safety improvements in Viet Nam\u2019s agricultural \noutputs, which thereby meet domestic and international requirements. To attain this outcome, \nthe Project will (i) create effective regulatory institutions for state management of agro-product \nsafety  and  quality  systems  to  meet  domestic  and  export  requirements;  (ii)  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of agro-production, processing, and marketing to ensure the safety and quality of \nvegetable, fruit, and tea products for domestic consumption and export; and (iii) support biogas \ndevelopment to supply clean energy to households and reduce agro-product safety and health \nhazards from livestock waste in the 16 project provinces.  \n \nB.  Outputs  \n1.  Improved Regulatory Framework and Fully Operational Quality and Safety \nSystem for Agro-Products  \n26.  It will improve the institutional management and regulatory framework, particularly at \nMARD,36 so that safe agricultural products are produced, processed, and distributed. It will \nsupport (i) improvement of the regulatory framework and coordination for state management of \nquality and safety; (ii) quality and safety-related capacity development of state agencies and \ncertification bodies; (iii) establishment of a crop food safety management system (CFSMS) for \nfood safety coordination, monitoring, and management from the central to the commune level.  \n \n27.  Improvement of Regulatory Framework and Coordination for State Management.  A \ndetailed review will be undertaken of existing decrees, policies, and strategies for ensuring agro-\nproduct safety and quality in Viet Nam.37 It will assess whether regulations are consistent with \npolicies and strategies, and identify requirements for further regulations. The review will serve \nas the basis for formulating new regulations, policies, and strategies for improving the safety \nand quality of fruits, vegetables, and tea, and will recommend strategies for: (i) strengthening \ncoordination  among  MARD  agencies  and  cooperation  between  MARD  and  other  relevant \nministries and departments for food safety; (ii) identifying lead agencies for different aspects of \nfood safety, and establishing a multi-level food safety system; (iii)  establishing monitoring, \ninformation, and communication systems; (iv) developing SAZs; and (v) developing standards, \naccreditation and certification procedures, and certification incentive policies.  \n \n28.  Strengthening Capacity of State Agencies and Certification Bodies. The Project will: \n(i)  facilitate  the  development  of  policies  and  regulations  on  food  safety  and  quality;  (ii) \nstrengthen the capacity of the lead agencies within MARD (namely DCP and NAFIQAD) in food \nsafety coordination and monitoring and certification for agro-product quality and safety; (iii) \n                                                 \n36  An assessment of the Government\u2019s institutional capacity for food quality and safety regulation and certification is \nin Supplementary Appendix B. \n37 Over  200  food  safety  regulations  will  be  reviewed,  consolidated,  and  harmonized  to  facilitate  certification, \nenforcement, inspection, and monitoring by agencies concerned, and to allow producers, processors, and traders \nto easily conform with these regulations and with international food quality and safety standards. \n   ", "10   \nsupport the design and establishment of a provincial food safety index and an agro-product \nsafety information and communication system; (iv) improve the skills and knowledge of food \nsafety  specialists  at  MARD  (about  134  staff)  and  DARD  (about  144  staff  in  16  project \nprovinces), who will in turn train district and commune food safety facilitators; (v) further develop \nVIETGAP and other standards for agro-product safety and quality, including improvement of the \ninspection system; (vi) improve planning and management capacity of SAZs; (vii) improve the \ncapacity of food safety facilitators to demonstrate and disseminate good agricultural practices; \nand (viii) improve the capacity of laboratories to perform tests and risk analysis. In addition, staff \nfrom up to 100 potential certification organizations and 20 laboratories will be trained. \n \n29.   Establishment of a Crop Food Safety Management System. The creation of the \nCFSMS38 will include: (i) establishment of a standing committee on food safety at MARD, \nheaded by a MARD vice minister; (ii) establishment of a food safety monitoring unit within \nNAFIQAD; (iii) establishment of a crop food safety management unit within DCP responsible for \nformulation of policies, development of standards, accreditation of certification bodies, and \ncommunication of information on crop food safety; and (iv) identification of staff for specialized \npositions at the central, provincial, district, and commune levels responsible for (a) management \nof the food safety system, (b) facilitation of safe food production, and (c) internal control system \n(ICS) of certified producers. The proposed system is consistent with existing regulations that \ngive  a  mandate  to  DCP  in  crop  food  safety  and  to  NAFIQAD  in  overall  food  safety  and \nmonitoring.  Designated  food  safety  specialists  at  MARD  and  the  DARDs,  and  district  and \ncommune food safety facilitators will assist in piloting of CFSMS in the 16 project provinces.    \n \n  2.  Infrastructure and Facilities for Quality and Safe Agro-Products  \n \n30.  This  component  will  support:  (i)  implementation  of  SAZ  plans  and  development  of \nsupport infrastructure in SAZs; (ii) certification of agro-products; (iii) strengthening of provincial \ncapacity for agro-food safety monitoring and assessment, including training for farmers, primary \nprocessors, and traders on GAPs, hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP), and other \nfarm  food  safety  standards-based  practices;  (iv)  replacement  of  pest-  and  disease-prone \nvarieties with tolerant varieties; and (v) provision of support services to project provinces. The \nfirst four subcomponents will be mainly implemented by DARD in each of the 16 provinces. The \nfifth subcomponent will operate at central and regional levels, but will benefit all 16 provinces.  \n \n31.  Implementation  of  Safe  Agricultural  Zones  Plan  and  Development  of  Support \nInfrastructure.39 The Project will support development of SAZs through (i) analysis of soil and \nwater parameters, and assessment of conditions for production and preliminary processing; and (ii) \nmapping and registration of safe production zones under provincial land planning zone schemes. In \neach of the 16 provinces three model sites will be established to demonstrate safe production, \nprimary processing and/or packing, and trading. Project will also support (i) development of risk \nassessment procedures, legal registration of plans, and consultation among land owners and \nstakeholders; and (ii) design and construction of basic public infrastructure in the SAZs, such as \ninternal access roads and safe water irrigation systems, safe water wells for washing vegetable \nproducts, waste management facilities, and support infrastructure for postharvest, packing, and \ngrading. To maintain the agro-product safety along the marketing chain, the Project will (i) \nestablish and/or rehabilitate wholesale market facilities, and (ii) upgrade markets and group \nfarm shops where facilities for improved hygiene and storage management as well as facilities \nfor safe water and waste management will be installed. \n                                                 \n38  See Supplementary Appendix C on the crop food safety management system. \n39  A description of the SAZs is presented in Supplementary Appendix D. ", "  11 \n32.  Certification of Agro-Products. The Project will provide support for: (i) certification of \nproduction,  primary  processing,  and  trading  entities  seeking  certification  with  VIETGAP, \nInternational Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements recommended organic standards, and \nother standards (e.g., GLOBALGAP and HACCP); (ii) production and marketing entities with respect \nto  the  cost  of  (a)  processing  certification  applications,  (b)  testing  and  initial  inspection,  (c) \ninformation, (d) developing linkages along the certified market chain, and (e) development of a logo \nfor licensing; and (iii)  equipment and logistics, and strengthening staff capacity in relevant \nprovincial agencies for monitoring and assessment of agro-production safety and quality.  \n \n33.  Strengthening  Provincial  Capacity  for  Agro-Food  Safety  Monitoring  and \nAssessment and Training to Farmers, Primary Processors, and Traders. The Project will \nbuild capacity of certification bodies in (i) training and advising production and marketing entities \nseeking certification for food safety, VIETGAP, organic, and other standards; and (ii) facilitating \nprocessing of certification applications, testing, and initial required inspections. About 50 staff in \neach province will be trained in GAP and food safety system monitoring, assessment, and \ncertification while about 500 production, processing, and marketing enterprises will be certified \nduring project implementation. Support will also be provided for (i) training farmers, postharvest \nprocessors  and  enterprises  in  VIETGAP;  (ii)  setting  up  an  agro-products  safety  management \nsystem; and (iii) improvement of provincial and district extension facilities for food quality and safety. \n \n34.  Replacement of Poor Quality and Pest- and Disease-Prone Varieties with Better \nVarieties to Improve Quality and Safety of Agro-Products. The Project will support farmers in \nreplacing some fruit and tea varieties that are highly vulnerable to disease infection, thereby \nreducing the dependence of farmers on agro-chemicals and improving the quality and safety of \nagro-products. This is particularly important in lowland tea areas and for certain fruits, such as \nlychee, that have a short and intensive harvest season. About 20 pest and disease-tolerant fruit \nand  tea  varieties  will  be  developed  during  project  implementation  to  replace  susceptible \nvarieties currently being grown by farmers. The new varieties are expected to be cultivated in at \nleast 35% of the area targeted by provinces for variety replacement. \n \n35.  Provision of Laboratory Services to Project Provinces. The capacity of laboratories in \nViet Nam will be assessed with regard to their operational efficiency, the presence/absence of \noperating  and  financial  management  systems,  and  personnel/logistical  requirements  (i.e., \nincremental staff, equipment, and related facilities), to determine investment requirements and the \ncost of upgrading regional laboratories. The Project will support the upgrading of three regional \nlaboratories in Da Nang, Ha Noi, and Ho Chi Minh City by providing these facilities with appropriate \ntesting equipment and sufficient qualified staff to meet the demand from monitoring and certification \nagencies for inspection, analysis, and assessment of agricultural products. The Project will also \nsupport the contract services of applied research and development institutions for the (i) creation of \nnew varieties; (ii) monitoring and evaluation; (iii)  design and transfer of standardized demonstration \nmodels in safe production, post harvest, and primary processing; (iv) marketing of safe products; \nand (v) information system and database development. \n \n3.   Biogas Development for Clean Energy, Improved Agro-Product Safety and \nReduced Health Hazards from Livestock Waste  \n \n36.  This component will support: (i) biogas infrastructure investment, (ii) a credit facility for \nbiogas, and (iii) demonstration and applied biogas research services.40 The component will be \nlinked to the design of a future investment project to expand the national biogas program \nthrough associated TA (para. 59). \n                                                 \n40 The description of support to the biogas development component, including unit cost of small biogas digesters and \ncriteria for selecting targeted households, is presented in Supplementary Appendix E. \n   ", "12   \n37.  Biogas  Infrastructure  Investment.  The  Project  will  provide:  (i)  direct  financial \nassistance for the construction of 20,000 household biogas units of various sizes to ensure safe \nand effective construction of biogas plants;41 (ii) support for biogas infrastructure development;42 \nand (iii) support for planning and integration of livestock within the SAZs. The Project will \nfacilitate construction of about 40,000 household biogas digesters in 16 provinces.43 \n \n38.  Credit for Biogas. The Project will provide a credit line that will be managed by a \nnumber of partner financial intermediaries active in the rural and agriculture sector in Viet Nam \nto facilitate easier access to credit among potential biogas farm households, with particular \nemphasis  on  the  poor,  women,  and  other  disadvantaged  groups.  Potential  financial \nintermediaries  identified  by  MARD  include  the  Viet  Nam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment (VBARD), Central Credit Fund (CCF) and its subordinate People\u2019s Credit Funds \n(PCFs), and Viet Nam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP).44 Based on assessment of the financial \nmanagement capacity and previous experience in ADB-funded projects, VBARD and the CCF \nand PCFs are good candidates to be included as business partners for delivering credit to \nbiogas households at the start of the Project. The participation of VBSP should be subject to the \nconduct of due diligence on its financial management.  \n \n39.  Demonstration  and  Applied  Research  Services.  Investments  under  this \nsubcomponent will provide support for (i) improving the design of existing household biogas \nplants, (ii) transfer of technology regarding biogas and digested slurry, and (iii) research and \ntransfer of technology for medium- and large-scale biogas plants. Research findings will serve \nas the basis for expansion of biogas development activities to a larger number of small farm \nhouseholds and medium-sized and large enterprises in other provinces. \n \n  4.  Project Management Support  \n \n40.  The Project\u2019s three components will place significant management demands on the key \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  of  MARD\u2014namely  APMB,  which  will  host  the  central  project \nmanagement unit (CPMU); DCP, where the institution project management unit (IPMU) will be \nestablished; and DLP, where the biogas project management unit (BPMU) will be established\u2014 \nas well as the 16 provincial DARDs, where the provincial project management units (PPMUs) \nwill be established. Project management support offices (with logistical facilities and technical \nstaff) will be established at APMB, DCP, DLP, and 16 provincial DARDs. In addition, a team of \nconsultants will render management support and technical advice to CPMU, IPMU, BPMU, and \nPPMUs, and to provide supervision and capacity-building assistance with respect to quality and \nsafety enhancement of agro-products and biogas development in the project area.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n41.  The Project will apply an integrated approach to enhancing the quality and safety of \nagricultural products. In addition to strengthening the institutional and regulatory capacity of \ngovernment  agencies,  and  the  capacity  of  agricultural  producers,  primary  processors  and \ntraders in applying GAPs and creating SAZs, the Project will also support biogas development \n                                                 \n41 Another 20,000 households will be provided financial assistance by the ongoing MARD-SNV Project: Support \nProject to the Biogas Program for the Agricultural Sector in Some Provinces in Viet Nam.  \n42 Includes promotion among stakeholders and farmers, training of technicians, quality supervision, and monitoring. \n43  Although the Project will provide direct financial support to only 20,000 biogas digesters, a credit line will be made \navailable to all 40,000 households (i.e., 20,000 biogas digesters targeted under the Project and 20,000 biogas \ndigesters targeted under the SNV project). \n44 The Central Credit Fund (CCF) and its subordinate People's Credit Funds (PCFs), Viet Nam Bank for Social \nPolicies and VBARD have submitted expressions of interest to participate in the Project. VBARD and CCF and its \nsubordinate PCFs have participated in the previous ADB-funded Tea and Fruits Development Project.  ", "  13 \nin project areas that will control environmental pollution and thereby reduce food quality and \nsafety-related risks, while making energy and fertilizer options available to rural households. \nThe strong complementarity and synergy between the interventions will enable the Project to \nhave a broader and more significant impact on livelihoods, productivity, and health (particularly \nof women and consumers) than would otherwise be possible.  \n \n42.  Clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  projects  will  be  developed  for  the  biogas \ncomponent  to  generate  additional  carbon-derived  revenue.  The  Government  may  use  this \nrevenue to recover initial financial support provided to biogas farmers, or to provide additional \nsubsidies to biogas households. It is estimated that the biogas component will reduce CO\n2 \nemissions by the equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons of CO  per year, once all 40,000 \n2\nbiogas digesters are installed. The total carbon-derived revenue is estimated at $200,000\u2013\n$300,000 per year for 10 years, assuming a carbon price of $10 per ton of CO  for credits \n2\ngenerated  until  2012,  and  $5  per  ton  thereafter.  MARD  is  working  with  ADB  and  the \nNetherlands Development Organization in Viet Nam (SNV) on necessary CDM documentation \nand institutional setup for the CDM project. The Project may also benefit from ADB's carbon \nfund(s)  for  upfront  cofinancing  for  future  carbon  credits.  The  possibility  of  developing  a \nprogrammatic CDM project for the national biogas program will also be explored; this would \nallow subsequent biogas projects to be added once the CDM program is registered. The CDM \nassessment is presented in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n43.  The project investment cost is estimated at $110.39 million, including taxes and duties of \n$8.67 million (Table 1).

Financing Plan \n \n44.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $95.00 million (equivalent of 62.4 million \nspecial drawing rights) from its Special Funds resources to cover 86.06% of the total project \ncosts. The Government will contribute $6.22 million (5.64% of the total Project costs), including \n$3.98 million by way of taxes and duties. The provincial people\u2019s committees of 16 project \nprovinces will contribute $6.47 million (5.86% of the total project costs), including $4.69 million \nin taxes and duties. Partner financial intermediaries will contribute $1.35 million (1.22% of the \ntotal  project  cost)  to  finance  biogas  loans  to  households.  Beneficiaries  of  the  biogas \ndevelopment component will contribute $1.35 million in local materials and/or labor, accounting \nfor 1.22% of the total project costs. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years with a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period, and 1.5% \nthereafter. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. Interest charges on the loan are \nto be capitalized. The summary financing plan is in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource    Total   Percent \nAsian Development Bank  95.00  86.06 \nCentral Government   6.22  5.64 \nProvincial People\u2019s Committees  6.47  5.86 \nPartner Financial Institutions  1.35  1.22 \nBeneficiaries (Biogas Development)  1.35  1.22 \n  Total    110.39  100.00 \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n45.  It is proposed that the ADB loan proceeds be utilized by the Government to finance \nproject activities using two mechanisms: (i) extension of a central budget grant to finance \nactivities related to quality and safety enhancement and the development of the biogas sector, \nand (ii) extension of loans to households via partner financial intermediaries (FIs) to finance \nconstruction  of  biogas  digesters.  The  central  budget  grant  will  finance  activities  related  to \ninstitutional  and  regulatory  development  (component  1),  development  of  production  and \nconsumption  of  safe  and  quality  agro-products  (component  2),  and  project  management \n(component 4). For biogas development (component 3), the central budget grant will support \nbiogas infrastructure, and applied biogas demonstrations, and services. Support for biogas \ninfrastructure  includes  a  financial  assistance  of  at  least  D1.0  million  for  eligible  project \nhouseholds to be disbursed after biodigesters are constructed, put in operation, and certified as \nmeeting the agreed technical standards. The financial assistance will be provided to households \nidentified  and  enlisted  by  the  Project  regardless  of  whether  such  households  finance  the \nconstruction of the biogas digester by partner FIs or from the households\u2019 own sources.  \n \n46.  For household loans to construct biogas digesters, MOF will enter into subsidiary loan \nagreements with partner financial intermediaries that will in turn extend subloans to eligible \nhousehold beneficiaries for construction of biogas digesters. The subsidiary loan from MOF to \npartner financial intermediaries will be denominated in dong and have a maturity of 20 years \nwith a grace period of 6 years. Terms and conditions of the subsidiary loans from MOF to \npartner financial intermediaries will be decided by the Government and agreed by ADB. Lending \ninterest rates of the Government\u2019s development assistance fund are expected to be used as a \nreference interest rate for subsidiary loans unless otherwise agreed between ADB and MOF.45  \n                                                 \n45 The current normal rate of interest applicable to funds from the Government\u2019s development assistance is about \n12%. MARD has proposed to MOF that a preferential interest rate be applied to the credit line to be provided for ", "  15 \n47.  Partner financial intermediaries will utilize the subsidiary loan proceeds for lending to \neligible household beneficiaries under the Project for construction of biogas digesters. Loans to \nhouseholds  will  carry  terms  and  conditions  as  currently  being  applied  by  partner  financial \nintermediaries  (which  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time).  Interest  rates  for  subloans  to \nhouseholds  will  be  determined  based  on  relending  rates  from  MOF  to  partner  financial \nintermediaries plus a margin agreed between MOF and partner financial intermediaries. The \nactual lending interest rates to households will be agreed upon in subsidiary loan agreements \nbetween MOF and partner financial intermediaries, and ensure that households have access to \naffordable financing for biogas digester construction. Households in the project provinces that \nare currently supported and recommended by the SNV-funded biogas development project are \nalso eligible for loans from partner financial intermediaries, if these households have demand for \nsuch loans. Technical and environmental criteria related to biogas will be added to partner \nfinancial intermediaries\u2019 standard loan eligibility criteria to ensure loans reach the Project\u2019s \ntargeted clientele. For each biogas loan amount, ADB will finance 81.8%, partner financial \nintermediaries  will  finance  9.1%,  and  households  will  contribute  9.1%  in  labor.  However, \ndisbursement of funds for the biogas investment credit facility will be subject to (i) entry by the \nfinancial intermediaries into a project agreement with ADB, and (ii) entry by the Government into \na subsidiary loan agreement with the financial intermediary(ies) concerned, with terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n48.  MARD will be the project executing agency (EA). A CPMU will be established in the \nAgricultural  Projects  Management  Board  (APMB)  for  overall  project  coordination  and \nmanagement.  A  total  of  16  PPMUs  will  be  established  in  the  DARDs  for  local  project \nmanagement. The Department of Crop Production (DCP) will establish an IPMU to implement \nactivities related to institutional and regulatory development on quality and safety. The DLP will \nestablish a BPMU to implement the biogas development program. A credit line provided under \nthe Project will be administered by the MOF and utilized by partner financial intermediaries to \nfinance eligible household biogas investments, which will be carried out at the local level by its \nprovincial branches. The Project will open one first-generation imprest account (FGIA) to be \noperated by CPMU and a FGIA to be operated by the MOF to finance the biogas credit lines to \npartner financial intermediaries. A total of 20 second-generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) will \nbe established, one for each of the 16 PPMUs, one for the IPMU, one for the BPMU, and one \nfor each of the two partner financial intermediaries. MARD and all agencies proposed as IAs \nhave adequate financial and management capacity and experience to implement the Project. \nThese are government budget-spending units, with staff capable of using standard government \naccounting and financial management systems. The APMB, DCP, DLP, and DARDs have \nimplemented  significant  donor-funded  projects,  including  ADB  projects.  The  Project\u2019s \norganizational chart is presented in Appendix 6.46    \n   \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n49.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from July 2009 to June 2015. The Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nconstruction of biogas digesters under the Project, considering the contribution of the biogas plants in improving \nwater quality and environmental hygiene as part of the water and environmental hygiene program of MARD. \n46  The detailed organizational structure for CPMU, DCP/IPMU, DLP/BPMU, and PPMUs, and broad terms of \nreference for their respective staff are in the Supplementary Appendix H. \n   ", "16   \n3.  Procurement \n \n50.  A procurement plan is outlined in Appendix 8 with indicative procurement and recruitment \ncontracts. No international procurement is envisaged under the Project. Prior and post review \nthresholds were discussed and agreed with the EA and are included in the plan. Procurement \nwill mainly be undertaken by the CPMU. Goods, works, and services financed by ADB will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Packages for works valued at less than $2.0 million or equivalent but more than $100,000 \nor equivalent, and packages for goods valued at less than $1.0 million or equivalent but more \nthan  $100,000  or  equivalent,  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. For goods and works packages valued below $100,000 or \nequivalent, shopping procedures acceptable to ADB will be used. Plant and seed varieties \nrequired for the Project to replace pest- and disease-susceptible varieties will be purchased \ndirectly  from  a  list  of  prequalified  and  approved  government-owned  research  institutes  (in \nabsence of a market, commercial seeds are available primarily from government institutes). \nDirect contracting will be used to procure seed varieties required for the Project.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n51.  The Project will require a total of 208 person-months of consultant services, including 60 \nperson-months of international and 148 person-months of national consultant services in the \nfields  of  (i)  management  of  agricultural  product  quality  and  safety  systems;  (ii)  policy, \nregulations and institutional development; (iii) monitoring and evaluation; (iv) applied research \nand development for agricultural product quality and safety; (v) risk analysis; (vi) communication \nand training programs; (vii) social development; (viii) environmental assessment; (ix) financial \nmanagement; (x) biogas technology; and (xi) rural infrastructure.47 The international specialist in \nagricultural product quality and safety management will act as the team leader.The consultants \nwill be recruited through a firm following the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) process, \nwith a 90:10 quality-cost ratio due to the specialized nature of the Project, and  in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n52.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  MARD  and  APMB.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MARD, APMB, CPMU, IMPU, BPMU, PPMUs, \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \nThe project design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigation of corruption risks. \nRisks associated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be \nmitigated by (i) engaging an international consultant and a national consultant to advise and \nassist in the procurement of goods and services, and the engagement of other consultants; (ii) \nintroducing a dual signing system in which the civil works contractor awarded the contract will \nalso sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodic inspection by the CPMU \nof the contractor\u2019s activities relating to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n                                                 \n47 Detailed consultant terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix I. ", "  17 \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n53.  To  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  timely  loan  disbursement,  the \nGovernment  will  establish  two  or  more  FGIAs  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB \nimmediately after loan effectiveness for the exclusive use of ADB loan proceeds. One FGIA will \nbe administered by the MARD (CPMU) to finance project activities and the other FGIA will be \noperated by the MFIs to finance the biogas credit lines. The maximum ceiling for the CPMU \nFGIA will be 6 months of estimated expenditures to be funded from the CPMU FGIA, or $8.29 \nmillion (10% of $82.85 million), whichever is lower. The maximum ceiling for the FGIA for the \nbiogas credit line will be 6 months of estimated expenditures to be funded from the FGIA, or \n$1.215 million (10% of the credit line of $12.15 million), whichever is lower. Funds will flow to \nthe  various  IAs  (DCP-IPMU,  DLP-BPMU,  PPMUs,  and  partner  financial  intermediaries)  to \nfinance the activities they are individually responsible for. The DCP-IPMU, DLP-BPMU, and \neach of the 16 PPMUs will establish an SGIA at the provincial treasury of the respective project \nprovince to ensure proper management of the provincial accounts to finance eligible activities \nrelated to quality and safety. Loan proceeds will be made available from the FGIA to the SGIAs. \nThe maximum ceiling of each SGIA will be equivalent to 6 months estimated expenditures to be \nfunded from the SGIA, or $300,000, whichever is lower. The SGIAs are required for locally \npurchased equipment and materials, contractual services, and small-scale training activities at \ngeographically dispersed locations in the 16 project provinces, and will be managed by the \nIPMU, BPMU, and PPMUs, which will prepare liquidation and replenishment requests for the \nSGIAs. These will be submitted to the CPMU, which will consolidate the requests and send \nthem to MOF. Disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n54.  For the biogas credit line, two SGIAs will be opened and managed by the head offices of \neach of the two partner financial intermediaries. The maximum ceiling will be the lower of (i) 6 \nmonths of estimated biogas loan disbursements funded through the SGIA; or (ii) 10% of the \ncredit line amount in accordance with the subsidiary loan agreement between MOF and the \nfinancial intermediary. Partner financial intermediaries will utilize their own internal systems to \ntransfer the subsidiary loan proceeds to their local branches in the 16 project provinces to \nextend  biogas  loans.  The  subsidiary  loan  proceeds  will  be  exclusively  for  financing  the \nconstruction of biogas digesters. The biogas loan portfolio will be accounted for and reported \nseparately. Partner financial intermediaries will submit requests for ADB financing through MOF, \nusing the list of biogas loans actually extended, and based on the needs of the Project.   \n \n55.  All the imprest accounts, including the SGIAs, will be established, managed, replenished, \nand liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  the  financial  regulations  of  the  Government.  The  accounts  will  be \nliquidated and replenished according to ADB's statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures, \nbased on withdrawal applications submitted to ADB from time to time. Each individual payment \nreimbursed or liquidated using the SOE procedures will not exceed $100,000 equivalent. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n   \n56.  CPMU, DCP-IPMU, DLP-BPMU, PPMUs, and partner financial intermediaries involved in \nproject implementation will maintain records and accounts that identify goods and services from \nloan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. \nThese  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples  and  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  The  CPMU  will  review  and \nconsolidate the accounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound accounting \npractices by the sovereign audit agency of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. \n   ", "18   \nThe audit report will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB \nwere used for the purposes for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on the \nuse of the imprest accounts (including the SGIAs) and SOE procedures. Copies of the audited \naccounts and auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each \nfinancial year. The CPMU will prepare consolidated quarterly reports indicating progress made, \nproblems encountered during the period, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected for the next quarter. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, the CPMU will submit to ADB a completion report that \ndescribes achievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n57.  CPMU will establish and maintain a project performance management system designed \nto permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, \nactivities, and development impacts. The system will adopt gender disaggregated indicators, \nincluding  those  specified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  regarding:  (i)  physical \nprogress of the implementation of specified component and/or subcomponent activities; (ii) the \nnumber and area of SAZs, with soil and water monitoring data; (iii) the safe agricultural product \nmodel areas established, their area, and number of farmers involved; (iv) the quantity and value \nof agro-products produced that are certified as safe; (v) the volume of agro-products traded in \nwholesale markets and supermarkets that are certified as safe; (vi) the number and type of \nlaboratory tests completed on agro-product quality and safety; (vii) changes in farm incomes \nand poverty incidence; and (viii) social development. The CPMU will confirm achievable targets, \nfirm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later \nthan 6 months after project inception. Baseline and progress data will be reported by the IPMU, \nBPMU, and PPMUs to the CPMU at the requisite time intervals, including annual reporting on \nthe environmental management plan. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n58.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  (at  least  twice  per  year)  reviews  throughout  project \nimplementation to assess implementation performance and achievement of project outcomes \nand objectives, examine financial progress, and identify issues and constraints affecting the \nProject and work out time-bound action plans for their resolution. ADB and the Government will \nundertake a midterm review to assess implementation status and take measures (which could \ninclude  modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements  and  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds) as appropriate. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n59.  Associated TA will be provided to strengthen project management and develop strategies \nand options for expanding Viet Nam\u2019s biogas program. Part 1 of the TA will provide startup \nsupport for the Project, including oversight and capacity building. The oversight function will \nprovide advisory support to the Government on how to effectively implement and monitor project \nactivities related to the quality and safety of agricultural products and biogas development. Part \n2 will provide a design for an investment to expand biogas development involving: (i) technical \ndesign  of  biogas  plants  of  varying  sizes  for  farm  households  and  medium-  to  large-scale \ncommercial  livestock  farms,  based  on  field  testing,  demonstration,  and  applied  research \nactivities (para. 39); (ii) determination of credit financing options for different socioeconomic \ngroups; (iii) determination of a geographical expansion plan and strategy; (iv) design of a \npractical institutional and management structure for expanded biogas development; and (v) \ndevelopment of CDM projects. The estimated cost of the TA is about $1.8 million, of which ", "  19 \nabout $1.5 million will be financed under the Project through an ADB grant, with $0.3 million \nfinanced by the Government in the form of incremental administrative expenses, office space, \nlocal travel, and per diem for counterpart staff. The TA will require 103 person-months of \nconsultant services, comprising 46 person-months of international consultant and 57 person-\nmonths of national consultant services. All consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Individual consultants will be recruited for part \n1, while a firm will be recruited, using the QCBS procedure, for part 2. In view of the highly \nspecialized nature of the consultant inputs a 90:10 quality-cost ratio will be used in consultant \nselection. Details of the proposed TA are presented in Appendix 9.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n \n60.  Project  Benefits  and  Impact  on  Policy/Strategy  Implementation.  The  Project  is \ndesigned to support the Government\u2019s effort to implement a comprehensive legal and regulatory \nframework related to food safety and quality, including a law on product standards, labels, and \ninspection, ordinance on food hygiene and safety, and the national action plan for food safety. It \nwill also facilitate the implementation of the national strategy for environment protection (2001\u2013\n2020) which (i) aims to halt the spread of pollution, restore degraded areas, improve overall \nenvironmental quality, and ensure achievement of sustainable national development; and (ii) \nrecognizes and guarantees that all citizens are entitled to live in an environment where the \nquality of the air, land, and water meets standards stipulated by the State. Moreover, the Project \nwill assist the implementation of the national energy policy, which focuses on renewable energy \ndevelopment as a substitute for firewood in line with the forest protection strategy. The Project \nwill provide timely support to the implementation of these policies and strategies along with \ncreation of SAZs and biogas development. These will help realize the main objective of SEDP  \n2006\u20132010 to attain middle-income nation status by late 2010.48 \n \n61.  Socioeconomic impacts. The project area covers about 3.9 million ha of agricultural \nland, with about 3.6 million rural households (or an equivalent of 18 million people) in 16 \nprovinces, where the rural poverty incidence is estimated at 25.9% compared to the national \naverage of 22.0% (2005 data). 49 Main benefits attributable to the Project will include:  \n \n(i)  incremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through adoption \nof high yield and tolerant seed varieties, IPM, and GAPs. An estimated 6.5 million \nfarmers will directly benefit from the project interventions. The Project is also \nexpected to generate employment for about 1.4 million people involved in the \npost-production food chain for tea, fruits and vegetables. As a result, the Project \nwill make significant contributions to rural poverty reduction within and outside of \nthe project provinces;50 \n(ii)  health cost savings realized through safe agricultural products (tea, fruits, and \nvegetables) and improved livestock waste management. It is expected that a \nsignificant reduction in the occurrence of food- and waterborne diseases will \nimprove human health in the project area, resulting in increased labor productivity \n                                                 \n48 Detailed policy and economic justifications are in Appendix 10. \n49 The Project\u2019s poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n50 The average poverty incidence In project provinces was estimated to be 25.9%. The project interventions will \ncontribute significantly to reduction of the national poverty incidence (expected to reach about 15.0% by 2010). \n   ", "20   \nand reduced treatment and hospital costs.51  Likewise, replacement of charcoal \nand firewood by biogas for cooking will have direct health benefits to women;  \n(iii)  cost savings from substitution of biogas-derived energy for firewood, kerosene, \ncoal,  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  used  for  cooking  and  lighting.  The \nProject  will  contribute  to  energy  savings  among  rural  households  as  biogas \nproduced by the digesters will serve as an alternative energy source for cooking \nand lighting. An estimated 40,000 households will benefit from this alternative \nenergy source;  \n(iv)  availability of bio-slurry as a safer organic fertilizer than untreated manure.52 \nWhile farmers are currently using manure for their crops, the untreated manure is \nconsidered unsafe for water, air, and soil. Although no empirical evidence is \navailable on the incremental impact on crop yields in Viet Nam of bio-slurry \nversus manure that is otherwise treated, elsewhere bio-slurry has been claimed \nto be a better fertilizer than artificially treated manure;53 and \n(v)  reduced water, air, and soil pollution as a result of biogas digester installation and \noperation, because domestic and livestock wastes will be better managed and \ntreated. It is estimated that the proposed biogas development will reduce CO\n2 \nemissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons of CO per annum.  \n2 \n \n62.  A number of other benefits will be attributable to the Project. First, the combination of \nfood safety and biogas-related activities will create better-paid employment opportunities in local \nareas  and  reduce  outmigration.  Second,  improvement  in  management  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) activities will reduce the annual O&M costs paid by governments and/or \nfarmers. Third, in addition to adopting IPM and GAPs, participating farmers will exchange \nexperience and skills related to food safety, including production efficiency and productivity. \nFourth, women, as a major source of on-farm labor, will be exposed to new farming practices, \nknowledge and skills, which will improve their social and economic status. Women comprise half \nof all workers in the agriculture sector, and contribute more hours of labor to cultivation, and \nprocessing and marketing of agricultural produce than men. Replacement of charcoal and \nfirewood with biogas for cooking will reduce health risks for women by providing a clean kitchen \nenvironment.  Finally,  project  interventions\u2014such  as  establishment  of  SAZs  and  training  of \nfarmers regarding GAPs and other farm food safety standards-based practices\u2014will positively \nimpact ethnic minorities in the project area.54 The Project\u2019s gender action plan ensures women \nwill be equitably benefited from the Project (Appendix 12). Detailed analyses are in Appendix \n10. \n \n63.  Project interventions, including the establishment of SAZs, will not alter the current land \nholding structure, and are not expected to entail involuntary resettlement. Infrastructure within \nSAZs will only be constructed on public land or where communities agree to donate their land in \nexchange  for  benefits.  The  Project\u2019s  social  development  specialist  will  undertake  a  social \nassessment at each model site in consultation with landowners and stakeholders. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n64.  Environmental Impact. The Project is designed to contribute to safer, better quality \nagricultural outputs and reduce health hazards from livestock wastes. The Project has been \n                                                 \n51 According  to  Viet  Nam  Food  Administration,  poisoning  from  microbiological  contamination  and  excessive \npesticides in fruits, tea, and vegetable products accounted for about 30% of all food poisoning cases (Tran Dang. \n2008, presentation to food safety working group meeting, 28 March 2008, Viet Nam Food Administration. Ha Noi). \n52 In traditional practice, domestic and livestock waste is collected, piled up and covered with pond mud for about a \nmonth before being applied to crops as \u201corganic fertilizer\u201d.  \n53 Information was derived from the SNV report on biogas operation. \n54 The Project is classified as category B for indigenous peoples. ", "  21 \nclassified as environmental category B (non-sensitive) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out to assess the overall \nproject impacts, and revealed no significant adverse environmental impacts. Potential adverse \nimpacts associated with construction or improvement of existing small-scale infrastructure in the \nestablished  SAZs  are  temporary,  minor,  and  localized  in  extent  and  can  be  mitigated  to \nacceptable levels. The environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) will guide the \nenvironmental assessment, with institutional responsibilities for the subprojects to be identified \nduring implementation. Relevant environmental reports, including a summary IEE, IEE, and \nEARF, are presented in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nB.  Risks \n65.  Risks that may hinder realization of the expansion of opportunities to supply safe, quality \nfruit, vegetable and tea products to the domestic and export markets are: (i) producers of agro-\nproducts (i.e., vegetables, fruits, and tea) may not be fully convinced of the need to comply with \nnational and international quality standards; and (ii) promotional strategies may be unable to \nbuild consumer trust and confidence and increase awareness and recognition of safe agro-\nproduct brands, particularly regarding their certification schemes and logos, because of frequent \npast food safety scares. These risks would render Vietnamese agro-products unable to compete \nwith  foreign-produced  agricultural  products  in  the  domestic  and  international  markets.  The \nProject is designed to reduce these risks by building institutional capacity for effective regulation \nand enforcement of standards, and by strengthening the capacity of agricultural production and \nmarketing units along the supply chain, backed by certification, promotion, and an intensive \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  campaign.  The  approach  will  follow  the \ninternationally recognized principles of HACCP to assure buyers that all parties involved in \nproducing and handling safe quality products are independently monitored, and that products \nmeet stringent food safety standards. The Project will assist the Government in the continued \ndevelopment and review of standards to meet international market requirements. \n \n66.  Successful reduction of risks to agro-product safety and health quality through biogas \ndevelopment will require strong project management capacity and coordination at the provincial \nlevel between the DARDs and financial intermediaries. There is also a risk that the Biogas \nDevelopment Program may be delayed and may not attain the target of 40,000 households due \nto (i) an inadequate supply of trained masons to construct the biogas digesters, resulting from a \nlack of interest in participating in the biogas development program; and (ii) failure by targeted \nlivestock  producers  to  avail  themselves  of  credit,  due  to  non-acceptance  of  the  biogas \ntechnology. To mitigate these risks, the Project will disseminate information on the Biogas \nDevelopment Program as well as provide training on masonry. Enhanced support from both the \nGovernment and SNV will provide training for masons and households and dissemination of \ninformation on biogas technology. In order to ensure that financial assistance is accessible to \nsmall livestock production units, the Department of Livestock Production and provincial DARDs \nwill work with partner financial intermediaries to extend microcredit support.  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n67.  The institutional backbone of the Project will be formed through establishment of a \nstanding committee on food safety for overall coordination of food safety issues, a food safety \nmonitoring unit at NAFIQAD, a crop food safety management unit at DCP, and subunits for food \nsafety at DARDs. These will not significantly increase staff numbers or other incremental costs. \nThe Government has assured ADB of adequate counterpart funds for project implementation \nand for O&M of the food safety system, equipment and facilities established and procured under \nthe  Project.  Ongoing  ADB-funded  projects  will  enhance  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability  (these \ninclude  the  Agriculture  Science  and  Technology  Project),  and  cover:  (i)  client-oriented \n   ", "22   \nagricultural  research  and  capacity  strengthening;  (ii)  grassroots  agricultural  extension \nimprovement; and (iii) rural-based technical and vocational training. The Government\u2019s Biogas \nProgram aims to enhance technical and promotional capacity for biogas usage in Viet Nam. The \nGovernment  has  assured  ADB  that  the  Netherlands-funded  project  TA  for  biogas  will  be \nexpanded in all 16 project provinces. The proposed associated TA for project management and \ndeveloping strategies and options for expanding the biogas development component into a \nnational biogas program will further enhance project sustainability.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.    Specific Assurances \n \n68.  The Government will ensure that:  \n \n(i)  Information, education, and communication activities are carried out in all project \nprovinces to promote the replication of safe agriculture production models and \nbiogas technology application and utilization. \n(ii)  Consistent with the decision related to the national action plan for food safety and \nits implementation directive,55 and the decree on food safety management,56 \nunits for food safety monitoring, information, and communication will be piloted at \nNAFIQAD; food safety units will be piloted at DCP; and subunits for food safety \nwill be piloted at the project province DARDs. \n(iii)  Provisions for staff at the central, provincial, district, and commune level in the \nproject provinces will be made to facilitate the implementation of food safety \nregulations and policies by reassigning or adding responsibilities to existing staff, \nor identifying new staff to carry out the tasks of food safety specialists and food \nsafety facilitators. \n(iv)  Provincial governments complete the identification, designation, and registration \nof SAZ plans prior to undertaking any physical construction activities under the \nProject; \n(v)  The SNV Support Project to the Biogas Program will be expanded further to the \nremaining six project provinces i.e., Ben Tre, Binh Thuan, Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh,  \nLam Dong, and Ninh Thuan. If funding from SNV is not be forthcoming (as \nagreed upon between SNV, the Government, and ADB), the Government will \nfund expansion of the biogas program to the six project provinces. \n(vi)  Partner financial intermediaries will onlend loan proceeds to household borrowers \nin strict accordance with the criteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB. \nSubloans to households will comply with terms and conditions, including interest \nrates being applied by partner financial intermediaries, as may be amended from \ntime to time. Technical and environmental criteria related to biogas will be added \nto partner financial intermediaries\u2019 standard loan eligibility criteria to ensure the \nProject\u2019s targeted clientele is reached. For each household loan, ADB will finance \n81.8%, partner financial intermediaries will finance 9.1%, and the household will \nfinance 9.1%57 of the total cost of a biogas digester.  \n(vii)  Project activities will not cause significant environmental problems. Any potential \nadverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  managed  through  screening  of  final \n                                                 \n55 Prime Minister\u2019s Decision on the approval of national action plan on the assurance of food safety to 2010 No. \n43/2006/QD-TTg, dated 20 February 2006; and Prime Minister\u2019s Directive on the implementation of urgent \nmethods to assure food hygiene and safety No 06/2007/CT-TTg, dated 28 March 2007. \n56 Government Decree No. 79/2008/N\u0110-CP on the system of food safety management, inspection and testing, dated \n18 July 2008. \n57  Households provide a contribution equal in value to this percentage in the form of local materials and/or labor.  ", "  23 \ninvestment  plans,  incorporation  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental monitoring during implementation. The Government will ensure \nthat its laws and regulations governing environmental impact assessments, as \nwell as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) are followed. If there is any discrepancy \nbetween the recipient\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, then \nADB\u2019s policy requirements will apply. The Government will ensure that MARD, \nfollowing  relevant  government  internal  processes,  carries  out  environmental \nassessments prior to commencement of civil works. MARD will ensure that the \nassessments  (a)  meet  EARF  requirements,  and  (b)  include  details  of  local \nconsultations.  MARD  will  ensure  that  environmental  assessments  are  made \navailable at the PPMU office of each subproject province in a local language for \nthe public and other interested parties before the relevant subproject starts. \n(viii)  Project  interventions  will  have  no  resettlement  impact.  Construction  of  new \nfacilities  will  be  carried  out  on  existing  sites  on  public  land,  free  from  all \nencumbrances, habitation, dispute or controversy, and proposals for civil works \nwill include confirmation that no land acquisition or resettlement will be required \nunder the Project. In the event of unforeseen land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement,  the  Government  will  immediately  inform  ADB  and  prepare  the \nnecessary  planning  documents  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). \n(ix)    Project activities will be implemented in line with the proposed gender action \nplan. Women and men will be remunerated equally for work of equal value and \nchild labor will not be allowed. \n(x)  All project activities to be funded under the project will give special consideration \nto the participation and practices of ethnic minorities in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). In the event that indigenous people are \nbeneficiaries of any subproject, particularly SAZs, MARD will ensure that (a) all \nethnic  minority  groups  in  and  around  the  proposed  subproject  locations  are \nconsulted on their willingness to participate and on the suitability of the sites and \nsubproject activities, and are given equal opportunity to participate in subproject \nactivities,  including  training;  and  (b)  the  outcome  of  the  consultation  is \nsummarized in the subproject investment plans or subproject feasibility study. \n \nB.

Agriculture Sector Situation \n \n1.  During 2001\u20132006, Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of \n7.8% per year. In per capita terms, this was equivalent to about 6.7% per year, implying a rise in \nGDP per capita from $415 to $725 over the same period. The country\u2019s agriculture sector also \ngrew steadily at an annual growth rate of 4%, despite generally weak international commodity \nprices, especially over the last 3 years, and contributed about 20.4% to national GDP in 2006. \nCrops constitute about 59% of the total agriculture sector production value, followed by fisheries \n(19%), livestock (17%), and forestry (5%). Among major crops, the average annual production \ngrowth rates of vegetables (6.2%), fruits (3.5%), and tea (11.8%) were robust, and contributed \nsignificantly to the growth in the country\u2019s agricultural product exports. Among Southeast Asian \ncountries, Viet Nam has emerged as the largest tea producer, second in the production of \nvegetables, and third in fruit production, due mainly to growth and expansion of commercial \nfarms and small-scale agro-enterprises. The development of the livestock industry has likewise \nbeen vigorous in past years, both in quantity and size. Despite growth in the crop and livestock \nsubsectors, however, the poverty incidence remains higher in rural than in urban areas,1 and the \nlevel of private sector investment remains low. \n2.  Agriculture sector growth over the past decade, particularly in crops, can be attributed to \na combination of: (i) the Government\u2019s market-oriented economic policy, which was launched in \n1986 and led to progressive decontrol of prices and market functions, recognition of farm \nhouseholds as the key unit of production and marketing, and liberalized land-use rights; (ii) \nincreased public investment in irrigation systems; and (iii) increased use of land, labor and agro-\nchemicals and fertilizers, particularly in rice production. Continued heavy reliance on increased \npublic spending on irrigation systems, however, will not be able to sustain agricultural growth in \nlight of the diminishing marginal returns from new irrigation investments and the substantial cost \nof  operating  and  maintaining  these  systems.  Moreover,  further  increases  in  agricultural \nproduction, especially rice, are now being constrained by increasing input prices, declining \nrevenues from rice exports due to weak international prices, limits to productivity of agricultural \ninputs and financial capacity of farmers, and limits on further expansion of the rural labor force \nand land for agricultural cultivation.  \n \n3.  Agriculture provides employment for about 57% of the country\u2019s workforce, mainly from \nrural areas, where about 73% of the population resides and where most of the poor (about \n70%)2 are located.3 An alternative strategy for sustainable agricultural growth is needed to \nsupport the country\u2019s economic growth and attainment of its poverty reduction targets. This \nstrategy will require the development of: (i) diversified farming systems that are adaptable to \nvaried agro-ecological conditions; and (ii) more locally driven, productivity-based improvements \nin  quality  and  safety  for  increased  value  and  competitiveness  of  agricultural  products, \nparticularly high-value crops. There is growing interest in supporting commercial production of \nannual and perennial crops (e.g., vegetables, fruits, and tea) that have exhibited rapid growth, \nwith improved access to domestic and international markets. This is reflected by the expansion \nof areas under these crops, while areas under food grain cultivation have declined significantly \n                                                 \n1  For example, in rural Son La, the poverty incidence is 46%, while in Ho Chi MInh City, the poverty incidence is 4%. \nSource: Vietnam General Statistics Office. 2007.Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2006.

", "30  Appendix 3   \nover the past decade.4 Moreover, the Government now accords high priority to quality and \nsafety improvements at all stages of the value chain (from production to retail), in response to \ndemand by consumers for higher and stricter food quality and safety standards. However, many \nimportant issues relating to agricultural diversification and food quality and safety still need to be \naddressed  by  the  Government  to  enable  agricultural  producers/traders  to  effectively  tap \ndomestic markets and compete globally. \n \n4.  Key constraints to further increases in agricultural production and improvements in the \nefficiency of agricultural product marketing include low product quality, poor marketing, weak \nbargaining power, and unsafe production zones.5 These constraints are compounded by the \nlack of knowledge on the part of farmers, primary processors, and traders regarding food safety \nhazards and techniques to address them. The competitiveness of the agriculture sector is also \nadversely  affected  by  small  farm  sizes  and  fragmented  landholdings,  which  constrain \neconomies  of  scale,  the  development  of  stronger  business  models,  and  the  provision  of \npostharvest facilities. In light of these constraints, efforts to enhance sector competitiveness \nshould be based on an overall strategy for improving access by major players to advanced \nproduction and postharvest technology and more efficient marketing. These efforts must be \ncomplemented  by  the  establishment  of  higher/stricter  quality  and  safety  standards  for \nagricultural products, and provision of services to facilitate access to financial assistance for the \ndevelopment of small and medium-scale enterprises, as well as the creation of safe agricultural \nzones6 to protect productive land from competing land development demands. \n \n5.  The trend away from food crop monoculture and toward crop diversification is expected \nto continue as the country\u2019s economy increasingly integrates with the world market through \nmembership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and regional free trade agreements among \nSoutheast  Asian  countries.  An  immediate  challenge  facing  Viet  Nam  is  meeting  WTO \ncommitments related to the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement.7 Viet Nam agreed to \nfully comply with the SPS Agreement immediately upon its accession to the WTO.8 The SPS \nagreement  requires  that  Viet  Nam  notify  WTO  members  of  changes  to  Vietnam's  SPS \nmeasures  and  of  proposed  changes  that  are  not  consistent  with  an  agreed  international \nstandard, so that countries that will be potentially affected by the proposed measure can be \nconsulted during the drafting process. Viet Nam will need to strengthen the capacity of its newly \nestablished SPS notification authority and inquiry point to enable it to answer questions related \nto SPS measures. \n                                                 \n4  For example, the area devoted to vegetables doubled from about 300,000 hectares (ha) in 1994 to about 605,000 \nha in 2004. The growth in production of vegetable soybeans (10.5%) and pomelo (15.5%) was also notable. Total \narea under food grain production in 2000 was about 8.4 million ha, declining to about 8.3 million ha in 2007. \n5  These are agricultural production areas assessed as having high levels of pollution and contamination as well as \ninadequate safe water and market access infrastructure.   \n6  These are agricultural lands that are safeguarded from excessive microbiological, chemical, and heavy metal \npollution and contamination. \n7  SPS measures include \u201cany measure: to protect human or animal life or health from risks arising from additives, \ncontaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in food, beverages or foodstuffs; to protect human life or health \nfrom risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants or products thereof, or from the entry, establishment or \nspread of pests; to protect animal or plant life or health from risks arising from the entry, establishment or spread of \npests, diseases, disease-carrying organism or disease causing organisms.\u201d (Source: Vergano, P. 2003, Vietnam's \nImplementation of the Transparency Provisions under TBT and SPS Agreement, EU, MUTRAP). Ha Noi. The SPS \nagreement includes \u201call relevant laws, decrees, regulations, requirements and procedures including, inter alia, end \nproduct criteria; process and production methods; testing, inspection, certification and approval procedures; \nquarantine treatments related to food safety.\u201d \n8  In contrast, all other developing countries, including Cambodia and the People's Republic of China (which only \nrecently joined the WTO), were given a transition period to comply with WTO agreements.

Exporters and other businesses also need to be made more aware of the importance of \nimplementing Codex Alimentarius9and WTO directives, as well as the need to certify that other \n \nstandards set by individual trading partners have been met. Mechanisms to trace suppliers need \nto be strengthened, so non-compliant sources can be determined and action taken against \nthese suppliers. Greater capacity will be needed to ensure that domestically produced products \nmeet international standards.10 The capacity of MARD staff to deal with these trade policy and \nenforcement issues requires strengthening.  \n \n7.  As  Viet  Nam  becomes  progressively  integrated  into  international  markets,  future \nagriculture sector growth will depend heavily on improved postproduction activities (i.e., grading, \nprocessing, and marketing) and measures to meet more stringent market requirements for \nquality and safety. Agro-industries will play a vital role in the development of export markets, \nleading to further product development and expansion of other sectors. However, these agro-\nindustries will increasingly rely on farmers for a reliable and secure supply of raw materials of \nconsistent quality and safety, and will need to provide attractive terms and support services for \nthese supplier farmers. In addition, the Government needs to sustain efforts to improve the \nperformance of state-owned enterprises under the State-Owned Enterprises Law, and further \nliberalize markets in order to promote viable private business opportunities in Viet Nam. \n \n8.  Another important aspect of the agricultural economy is the rapid growth in the livestock \nsubsector, which accounts for about 17% of the total agricultural production value, and has \ngrown at an average annual rate of 14% during 2001\u20132006,11 mainly as a result of swine \nproduction, which comprises about 80% of total livestock production.12 Most of this production \ntakes place within an integrated crop, livestock, and fish pond system, and up to 40% of \nhouseholds grow both livestock and vegetables.13 The rapid recent growth in the livestock \npopulation has increased concerns regarding the adverse impacts of traditional livestock waste \ndisposal methods, particularly on environmental quality, including water, soil, and air, and the \nsubsequent impacts on the quality and safety of agricultural crops and other agro-products. To \naddress this concern and to develop alternative and clean energy sources the Government, \nthrough a grant provided by the Government of the Netherlands,14 initiated its national biogas \nprogram  in  2003  to  contain  and  improve  the  management  of  livestock  waste  disposal  in \nselected provinces. The program was designed to mitigate and avert further environmental \npollution in major livestock production areas, and thereby ensure the quality and safety of \nagricultural food products such as fruits and vegetables. It also aimed to improve the health of \nthe affected population. The program has attained nationwide success, mainly as a result of: (i) \na well-established legal framework for program implementation and cooperation among relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  participating  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  private \norganizations; (ii) application of appropriate technology that small farm investors can afford; and \n                                                 \n9  Viet Nam had adopted about 60% of CODEX standards relating to food and foodstuffs as of 2005, and planned to \nadopt all remaining ones (Source: Ministry of Trade/European Union. 2005.

A total of 45,000 biogas plants have been constructed \nunder the program in 30 provinces during 2003\u20132007. Increasing demand for biogas technology \namong small farm households has resulted in implementation of a second phase (until 2011). \nDespite the growing demand for biogas technology among farmers, research and development \nin the design and financial viability of various sizes of biogas plants, particularly medium and \nlarge biogas plants, is still needed. \n \n9.  The  Government  recognizes  that  continued  agricultural  growth  will  require  both \ndiversified farming systems (i.e., crop and livestock farming systems) appropriate for varied \nagro-ecological conditions and more locally driven improvements in competitiveness, quality \nand safety, and the value of agro-products. Consequently, the Government has aimed to (i) \npromote production and processing of high-value products; (ii) improve agricultural research, \nextension, and market-information services; (iii) intensify efforts to ensure better product quality \nand food safety based on sound agricultural practices; and (iv) promote competitive business \nand agro-based products. The proposed Project is consistent with Government\u2019s efforts to \naddress these concerns and issues and is envisioned to contribute significantly to its strategy \nfor improving the quality and safety of agricultural products.  \n \nB.  Quality and Safety Improvement Issues \n \n10.  Current achievements in production growth are unfortunately being undermined by high \nenvironmental and health risks resulting from excessive fertilizer use (on average about 220 \nkilograms/ha)15 by Viet Nam\u2019s farmers, which is one of the highest input rates in Asia and the \nPacific. Crop yields have not increased in recent years despite substantial increases in fertilizer \nand agro-chemical usage, which has in turn been found to increase environmental and health \nrisks.16 Moreover, the lack of appropriate production management, particularly with regard to \ndisposal of livestock waste in densely populated areas, has contaminated water, land, and air, \nand greater effort must be expended to contain and improve livestock waste disposal, and to \npromote effective waste treatment/management technology. An estimated 73 million tons of \nlivestock waste are improperly disposed of annually into ponds, channels, sewers, etc., or left in \nfields, which eventually pollutes the surrounding areas. About 90% of wastewater samples \ntaken from livestock farms did not meet applicable standards (TCVN5945-1995), especially with \nregard to biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand levels.17  Moreover, if left \nuntreated, the waste is estimated to emit some 17.52 million tons of CO .18  \n2 \n \n11.  As a consequence, these biological contaminants have created serious environmental \nproblems  that  have  adversely  affected  the  health  of  the  affected  communities.  Frequent \nincidents  of  environmental  damage  and  poisoning  from  agro-chemicals  and  biological \ncontaminants have made consumers more conscious of the need for higher/stricter quality and \nsafety standards for marketed agricultural products. Although a growing number of processors \nand  exporters  have  modern  value  chains  and  established  quality  and  safety  certification \nsystems that meet export market requirements,19 and are certified and audited by international \n                                                 \n15  FAO. 2007. Selected Indicators of Food and Agriculture in Asia Pacific 1996-06, RAP 2007/15. Rome. \n16  Surveys conducted during 2005\u20132007 by the MARD Plant Protection Department observed that about 75% of \noranges, grapes, and mangos grown in various areas of Viet Nam had excessive pesticide levels. For beans and \nleafy vegetables, the incidence of excessive pesticide levels was observed to decrease from 50% to 15%\u201330% \nduring 2000\u20132005. \n17  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. 2008. Feasibility Study - Biogas Prgram for the Animal Husbandry \nSector in Vietnam 2007\u20132011. Ha Noi (14 January). \n18  Assumes that a ton of manure managed using traditional methods will emit about 0.24 tons of CO  equivalents. \n2\n19  Such as GlobalGAP, Codex Alimentarius food safety HACCP, and ISO 22000. ", "  Appendix 3    33 \ncertification bodies, a considerable portion of farmers remain outside this system and grow and \nsell inferior products in the open market. These \u201cfree producers\u201d not only bring average prices \nand quality down, but inevitably add to the contamination risk faced by exporters, processors, \nand consumers, and contribute to negative environmental and public health impacts. These \nissues  will  not  be  effectively  addressed  in  the  absence  of  a  domestic  \u201csafe  food\u201d  supply \nframework/strategy; if left unchecked, they will continue to negatively impact the environment \nand public health.  \n \n12.    The need for improvements in product quality and food safety has also become a critical \nissue in the context of improving Viet Nam\u2019s global competitiveness, which will necessitate the \nelimination of inefficiencies in product marketing and procurement of input supplies, and in other \nfactors that contribute to the increased cost (to Government and the private sector) of providing \nagricultural  support  services.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  appropriate  production  management, \nparticularly with regard to disposal of livestock waste in densely populated areas, has resulted in \nserious environmental problems (through water, land, and air pollution), with consequential \nadverse impacts on the health of the affected communities. \n \nC.  Policy and Institutional Issues \n \n13.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  focus  must  shift  from  increasing  production  volume  to \npromoting higher product value and income, if Viet Nam\u2019s farmers, processors, and traders are \nto be able to effectively tap domestic and remain competitive in international markets. In this \ncontext,  rapid  improvement  of  quality  and  safety  of  agricultural  products  (particularly  for \nvegetables, fruits, and tea) is required to address the needs of client farmers and enterprises in \norder to benefit from (i) improved product quality, (ii) better skills to deal with complex supply \nchains  and  sophisticated  markets,  (iii)  efficient  processing  and  postharvest  operations  and \ninnovative marketing skills, and (iv) improved collaboration between private and public sectors. \nThe Government decreed 2008 as the year of quality and safety for agricultural products, and \nestablished  the  National  Agro-forestry  and  Fisheries  Quality  Assurance  Department \n(NAFIQAD),20 with wide responsibility for formulating and implementing regulations. In addition, \na  food  safety  and  agricultural  health  action  plan  has  been  developed,  and  the  provincial \ndepartments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  (DARDs)  are  strongly  committed  to \nstrengthening their capacity to implement the quality and safety improvement projects. \n \n14.  The  attainment  of  targets  set  under  the  Government\u2019s  new  policies  and  strategies \nrelating to food safety and good agricultural practices\u2014Vietnam good agricultural practices \n(VIETGAP) is a new concept being promoted by Government agencies among producers, \nprocessors, and traders\u2014will be constrained by several issues: (i) farmers, government officials, \nconsumers, and the general public have limited understanding of and training in food safety; (ii) \nthere is a shortage of research scientists working on food safety, resulting in limited information \navailable  to  extension  staff  on  VIETGAP  and  Global  Good  Agricultural  Practices \n(GLOBALGAP);21  (iii)  linkages  between  research,  Department  of  Plant  Protection  (DPP), \nextension services, and farmers are weak; (iv) the operating budget provided to extension and \nplant  protection  staff  for  the  conduct  of  monitoring,  supervision,  and  field  demonstrations \nrelating  to  vegetables,  fruits,  and  tea  is  insufficient;  (v)  production  units  are  small  and \nfragmented, and farmers operate individually, with little incentive to adopt VIETGAP; (vi) a \n                                                 \n20  MARD Decision no. 29/2008/QD-BTS, 28 Feb. 2008. \n21  Standards for good agricultural practices (GAPs), drafted for vegetables, tea and fruits in early 2008, provide a \nbasic safe production compliance code for farmers and therefore meet exporter/processor basic requirements for \nHACCP or other international safety and quality standards. \n   ", "34  Appendix 3   \nregulatory framework to facilitate domestic adoption of and compliance with international food \nsafety standards does not exist, and no agency has a clear mandate for public sector crop \ninspection and certification; (vii) existing laboratories have limited capacity to undertake plant \ntissue testing, due to a shortage of qualified staff and operating funds; and (viii) the laws and \nregulations provide limited ability to enforce penalties imposed on violators, and penalties are \noften not enforced in any case. These have discouraged consumers from paying premium \nprices for safe, high quality food due to a lack of assurance regarding food quality, and limited \nawareness of safety or the availability of cheaper alternatives. \n \n15.  The Government has laid out strategies for sustainable development and environmental \nprotection,  in  support  of  its  regulatory  efforts  and  reform  initiatives.  For  example,  the \nSustainable  Development  Strategy  (Viet  Nam  Agenda  21)  for  harmonization  of  economic, \nsocial, and environmental development is a general activity framework designed to shift Viet \nNam  towards  a  sustainable  development  path.  It  considers  environmental  protection  and \nimprovement  as  crucial  elements  in  the  development  process.  The  national  strategy  for \nenvironment protection (2010\u20132020) aims to halt the spread of pollution, restore degraded \nareas, improve overall environmental quality, and ensure achievement of sustainable national \ndevelopment.  It  also  recognizes  and  guarantees  that  all  citizens  are  entitled  to  live  in  an \nenvironment where air, land, and water quality meet state standards. The national energy policy \nfocuses on the development of renewable energy that may substitute for firewood, in line with \nthe Government\u2019s forest protection policy and strategy. This policy is complemented by the \nrenewable energy action plan of the Ministry of Industry which has a focus that includes the \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources, with priority given to biogas development as an \nefficient energy source for rural and mountainous areas. The Project is consistent with the \nideals of these strategies and policies. It is also in line with the Government\u2019s Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, which is intended to guide Viet Nam to middle-income \nnation status by late 2010. \n \n16.  A number of regulations specify the functions and responsibilities of various MARD \ndepartments related to policy formulation, management, monitoring, inspection, communication, \naccreditation,  and  development  of  standards  related  to  food  safety.  However,  the  existing \nregulations provide insufficient clarity on three key institutional issues, namely (i) who will take \nthe  lead  in  coordinating  the  efforts  of  various  departments,  (ii)  who  will  take  the  lead  in \nmonitoring, and (iii) how the food safety management system will be managed. \n17.  Internal  and  External  Coordination.  Internally,  various  MARD  departments  are \nmandated with monitoring (e.g., the Department of Crop Production [DCP] and NAFIQAD) and \nall  departments  are  mandated  with  communication  and  policy  formulation.  It  is  unclear, \nhowever, which department will take the lead in coordination and how various efforts will be \nharmonized. Externally, MARD needs to coordinate its activities on food safety with other key \nministries, most notably the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Trade,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  and  various  key \norganizations such as the Viet Nam Food Administration and the Directorate for Standards and \nQuality. For example, the development of national food standards is managed by Directorate for \nStandards and Quality, but requires considerable input from MARD. MARD currently lacks a \nbody to coordinate with external agencies. \n18.  Monitoring. Existing regulations indicate monitoring is the responsibility of all MARD \ndepartments. NAFIQAD is mandated with supervising specialized monitoring activities by other \ndepartments, but no actual monitoring system\u2014with specific resources, budgets, and tools\u2014is ", "  Appendix 3    35 \nin place that is capable of producing regular reports on various aspects of food safety to allow \nprogress assessments and measure achievement of food safety policy objectives.  \n19.  Management. Development of an effective food safety management system requires \nestablishment of operational structures. Currently, no food safety units exist, either at the central \n(MARD) or provincial (DARD) levels. Staff engaged in food safety are usually involved in other \nactivities  and  not  fully  specialized  in  food  safety.  At  MARD,  for  example,  standards  and \npractices for safe production of fruits, vegetables, and tea have been established and a body of \nrelated regulations has been developed. However, there are only three part-time staff at DCP \ninvolved in these activities, while the department itself is charged with numerous functions and \nresponsibilities including policy formulation, accreditation of certification bodies, monitoring and \ninspection, communication, promotion of safe agricultural zones, and training.  \nD.  Regulatory Issues \n \n20.  In view of these problems and issues, the need to strengthen the country\u2019s regulatory \nframework and institutional capacity to enforce regulations for food quality and safety has been \ngiven the highest priority by the Government. Its accession to the WTO in November 2006 \naccelerated implementation of the Government\u2019s action programs for streamlining over 200 food \nsafety  regulations,  which  need  to  be  reviewed,  consolidated,  and  harmonized  to  avoid \nconfusion. Considerable work still needs to be done to establish a comprehensive regulatory \nframework, most of which is expected to be carried out under the action plan for food safety, \n2008\u20132012. The Government also aims to harmonize 50% of all standards in Viet Nam to \nconform  to  international  food  quality  and  safety  standards.  In  this  regard,  the  capacity  of \naccreditation organizations (such as DCP and the DARDs) will need to be strengthened, as \nmost of the staff involved in accreditation lack an adequate background on food safety and \naccreditation and certification. There is likewise limited coordination between MARD and the \nMinistry of Health in quality and safety inspection activities. The monitoring and inspection \nprocedures  and  system  need  to  be  streamlined,  and  staff  capacity  to  carry  out  this  task \nstrengthened, together with the laboratory system, which is needed to provide support at the \nregional and local levels.   \n   ", "     \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  3\n6\n   \n \n \n \n \n \nAmount A\np\nProject Title Duration Source Objectives Grant/Loan ($ million) p\nAgriculture Science and Technology 2007\u20132012 ADB Improve and modernize the Agriculture  Loan 30.0 e\nn\nScience and Technology system and d\ninstitutions  as well as the capacity of their ix\nstaff, reserachers, and other stakeholders.   4\nAgricultural Sector Development Program 2002\u20132007 ADB Support policy and institutional reforms to Loan 90.0\ndevelop an environment for market-based\nagricultural and agro-industry development.\nTea and Fruit Development Project 2000\u20132006 ADB Increase farm income and raise the value of Loan 40.2\nagricultural production through tea and fruit \ndevelopment.\nLivestock Competitiveness and Food Safety  Pipeline for WB Strengthen capacity of public and private sector Loan 75.0\n    Project 2008 institutions to provide support services and \ninfrastructure to small and medium farms.\nAgricultural Competitiveness Project Pipeline for WB Improve the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, Loan 55.0\n2009 and organization of farmers in the central\nregion of Viet Nam.\nFood and Agricultural Products Quality Projecta 2005\u20132010 CIDA Food safety, farm product value, and trade  Grant 16.0\ndevelopment (SPS export requirements and\nquality standards).\nAgriculture Sector Programme 2000\u20132007 DANIDA Capacity-building at the Ministry of Agriculture Grant 46.5\nand Rural Development and improvement of\nquality and safety in fisheries products.\nSupport Collaboration for Agriculture and 2004\u20132010 AusAID Increase productivity and competitiveness of Grant 15.0\n    Rural Development agriculture and rural enterprises through support\nfor agricultural research and development.\nMaking Markets Work Better for the Poor 2003\u20132007 ADB Enhance understanding of links between growth Grant 2.9\nDFID and poverty and the dynamics of markets and\nAusAID institutions.\nMarket Linkages and Capacity in Agriculture;  2003\u20132007 IFAD Promotion of public-private dialogue to maintain Grant 3.0\n   and Sustainable Peri-Urban Agriculture CIRAD poor-friendly fruit and vegetable street vending;\nAVRDC safe vegetable production pilots.\nSector Program Support Capacity Building  2006\u20132008 AusAID Building capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Grant 0.5\n   Program Rural Development enquire point for sector\nprogram support.\nPhytosanitary Capacity Building Project II 2005\u20132008 WHO/FAO Improve government capacity for pest risk  Grant 0.5\nNZAID analysis and export certification.\nMulti-lateral Trade Assistance Policy Program II 2004\u20132008 EU Assistance to the Ministry of Trade to strengthen Grant 0.8\nintegration into the global trading system.\nSupport for Biogas Program Phase I 2003\u20132006 DGIS Support for program development and construction  Grant 2.5\nof household biogas units.\nSupport for Biogas Program Phase II 2007\u20132010 DGIS Support for program development and construction  Grant 4.8\nof household biogas units.\nADB   =   Asian  Development   Bank,  WB  =  World  Bank,  CIDA  =  Canadian   International   Development  Agency,  DANIDA = Danish  International\nDevelopment   Agency,   AusAID  =   Australian   Agency  for  International  Development,  DFID =  Department  for  International Development, IFAD =\nInternational    Fund     for    Agricultural    Development,    CIRAD  =  Centre   de  Cooperation   Internationale    en   Recherche  Agronomique   pour   le\nDevelopment,   WHO  =   World   Health   Organization,  FAO = Food   and   Agriculture  Organization,  NZAID =  New  Zealand Agency for International\n Development, EU = European Union, DGIS = Netherlands General International Cooperation.\na Project implementation will be carried out in close collaboration with this project to avoid overlaps.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.", "              \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n% Total\nItem D Billion $ '000 Base\nForeign Local Total Foreign Local Total Costs\n A.

Irrespective  of  whether  post \nqualification  or  prequalification  is  used,  eligible  bidders  (both  national  and \nforeign) shall be allowed to participate.  \n(ii)  When prequalification is required, the evaluation methodology shall be based on \npass/fail criteria relating to the firm\u2019s experience, and technical and financial \ncapacity. \n                                                 \n1 Section 52 of ADB\u2019s integrity principles and guidelines (ADB. 2006. Integrity Principles and Guidelines.

", "Appendix 10      53    \nECONOMIC ANALYSES \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Project has four components: (i) development of the country\u2019s regulatory framework \nand  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  relating  to  food  safety;  (ii)  enhancement  of  the \nproduction and consumption of safe, quality agro-products and establishment of supporting \ninfrastructure and facilities; (iii) development of biogas plants among small livestock farms to \nreduce livestock waste hazards in agricultural areas and improve public health, environmental \nquality  and  livelihoods  through  waste  digestion  and  production  of  biogas  energy;  and  (iv) \ncapacity building of the central project management unit and provincial project management \nunits in project management and replication of project impacts.  \n \nB.  Overall Project Benefits \n \n2.  The project area covers 16 provinces that are considered major centers of vegetable, \nfruit, and tea production in Viet Nam, including Ha Noi in the north, Da Nang in the center, and \nHo Chi Minh City in the south. It covers about 3.9 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land with \nabout 3.6 million rural households (or an equivalent of 18 million people) in these provinces. A \nlarge number of small farm households in these areas raise livestock for a living and are in \nurgent need of appropriate livestock waste management and disposal facilities. The poorly \nmanaged disposal of livestock waste has created serious environmental problems that have \nadversely impacted community health. \n \n3.  The Project is expected to yield major benefits, including:  \n \n(i)  incremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through adoption \nof high yield and tolerant seed varieties, integrated pest management (IPM), and \ngood agricultural practices (GAPs). An estimated 6.5 million farmers will directly \nbenefit from the project interventions. The Project is also expected to generate \nemployment for about 1.4 million people involved in the post-production food \nchain for tea, fruits and vegetables. As a result, the Project will make significant \ncontributions to rural poverty reduction in and outside the project provinces;1 \n(ii)  savings in health costs realized through safe agricultural products (tea, fruits, and \nvegetables) and improved livestock waste management. It is expected that a \nsignificant reduction in the occurrence of food- and waterborne diseases will \ndirectly improve human health in the project area, resulting in increased labor \nproductivity and reduced treatment and hospital costs;  \n(iii)  cost savings from substitution of biogas-derived energy for firewood, kerosene, \ncoal,  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  used  for  cooking  and  lighting.  The \nProject  will  contribute  to  energy  savings  among  rural  households  as  biogas \nproduced by the digesters will serve as an alternative energy source for cooking \nand lighting. An estimated 40,000 households will benefit from this alternative \nenergy source.  \n(iv)  the availability of bio-slurry, as a safer organic fertilizer than untreated manure.2 \nWhile farmers are currently using manure for their crops, the untreated manure, \n                                                 \n1 The average poverty incidence in the project provinces was estimated to be 25.9%. The project interventions \ncontribute significantly to reduction of the national poverty incidence (expected to reach about 15.0% by 2010). \n2  In traditional practice, domestic and livestock waste is collected and piled up. Pond mud is used to cover the pile for \na month or so before it is used for crops as \u201corganic fertilizer\u201d.  ", "54  Appendix 10   \nwhen used as an \u201corganic fertilizer\u201d, is considered unsafe for water, air, and soil. \nAlthough no empirical evidence is available on the incremental impact on crop \nyields  in  Viet  Nam  of  bio-slurry  versus  manure  that  is  otherwise  treated, \nelsewhere bio-slurry has been claimed to be a better fertilizer than untreated \nmanure;3 and  \n(v)  reduced water, air, and soil pollution as a result of biogas digester installation and \noperations, because domestic and livestock wastes will be better managed and \ntreated.  It  is  estimated  that  the  proposed  biogas  development  operation  will \nreduce CO emissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons of CO  per \n2  2\nannum.  \n \nC.  Economic Analyses \n \n1.   Methodology and Assumptions \n \n4.  The proposed Project will adopt the sector financing modality, where the entire scope of \nproject activities is not known at the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) stage. \nTherefore, the economic analysis is conducted to evaluate the viability of the three sample \nsubprojects selected for feasibility studies rather than for the whole Project. These sample \nsubprojects include: (i) high-yield tea subproject in Lien Son district town of Yen Bai province; \n(ii) lychee fruits subproject in Hong Giang commune, in Luc Ngan district of Bac Giang province; \nand (iii) vegetable (tomatoes) subproject in Van Hoi commune, in Tam Duong district of Vinh \nPhuc  province.  The  economic  analysis  of  these  sample  subprojects  serves  both  as  a \nrepresentative evaluation of the economic viability of the whole project, and more importantly, \nas a set of benchmarking criteria for the selection of subprojects eligible for Asian Development \nBank (ADB) financing, as far as economic aspects are concerned. It should be noted that the \nanalysis placed greater emphasis on the latter objective, because only by selecting appropriate \nsubprojects  will  the  Project  as  a  whole  be  economically  viable.  Development  of  biogas \noperations was incorporated into the overall Project to enhance improvements in the quality and \nsafety of agricultural products. In spite of the Project\u2019s integrated nature, the financing of costs \nand  benefit  realization  of  the  biogas  operation  is  fairly  independent  of  the  other  project \ncomponents. The analysis of the economic viability of the biogas development is therefore \nconducted separately.    \n \n5.  The economic analyses were consistent with relevant ADB guidelines, handbooks, and \ntechnical notes.4 The Project has an implementation period of 6 years (2009\u20132015) and the \neconomic life of the project interventions has been assumed to be 20 years. For the present \nanalysis, the prevailing interbank exchange rate of D16,000 = $1 has been used.5 A discount \nrate of 12% has been used to estimate the net present value (NPV), and serves as a cutoff point \nfor the economic internal rate of return (EIRR).  \n \n6.  The  economic  analysis  determined  incremental  benefits  attributable  to  the  project \ninterventions. While a number of benefit streams are observed, the analysis includes only \nreadily quantifiable benefits attributable to the project interventions.

The analyses use a \nworld price numeraire where economic prices for traded crop inputs and outputs have been \nbased on the World Bank commodity price projections. Labor costs have been shadow-priced at \n0.85 of the wage rates, while other inputs have been adjusted by the standard conversion factor \nof 0.90 as applicable to Viet Nam. The economic viability of the Project is evaluated against \nstandard  benchmarks,  i.e.,  EIRR  >12%,  benefit-cost  ratio  (BCR)  >1.0,  and  economic  net \npresent value (ENPV) > 0. \n \n7.  The economic analyses of the three production subprojects are presented together, \nfollowed by the biogas development operation. Detailed assumptions, financial and economic \nfarm budgets, economic price derivations, project capital and operating costs profiles, and \nbenefit\u2013cost and sensitivity analyses are presented in Supplementary Appendix K and four \nExcel-based models. \n \n2.   Tea, Lychee Fruits, and Vegetable Subprojects \n \na.   Subprojects Description \n \n8.  The three sample production subprojects include a: (i) high-yield tea subproject in Lien \nSon District Town of Yen Bai Province; (ii) lychee fruits subproject in Hong Giang commune, in \nLuc Ngan District of Bac Giang Province; and (iii) a vegetable (tomato) subproject in Van Hoi \nCommune, in Tam Duong District of Vinh Phuc Province. These subprojects were selected \nbecause  they  are  representative  of  the  Project\u2019s  proposed  interventions  in  tea,  fruit,  and \nvegetable production in 16 provinces, and can be replicated in the other provinces. The Project \naims to help improve crop yields, productivity, and the market value of existing production types \nby (i) enhancing required infrastructure such as irrigation and clean water supplies; (ii) replacing \nseed varieties susceptible to pests and diseases with more tolerant seed varieties; and (iii) \nadopting IPM and GAPs, technical extension support, and other supports.

The proposed interventions are based on existing production, and beneficiaries are \nfarmer households that have been involved in the respective operations for over 10 years.

While  a  number  of  benefit  streams  are  expected  from  the \nsubproject  interventions,  the  economic  analyses  include  only  those  that  can  be  readily \nquantified.  In  case  of  the  three  subprojects,  the  benefit  streams  include  only  incremental \nbenefits from increased crop yields and productivity through adoption of high yield and tolerant \nseed varieties, IPM, and GAPs. For the high-yield tea subproject, incremental benefits are \nderived from two outputs: (i) green leaves and buds for export processing, and (ii) green leaves \nfor grade 2 product processing for domestic consumption. The lychee subproject\u2019s incremental \nbenefits are estimated from lychee fruits grown for export to Asian and European markets (30%) \nand  lychee  fruits  for  domestic  market  consumption  (70%).  For  the  vegetable  (tomato) \nsubproject, grade 1 and 2 tomatoes for supermarkets and grade 3 and others for city-center \npublic  markets  are  also  estimated  separately  for  benefit  calculation  purposes.  Detailed \nestimations of costs and benefits of the three subprojects are presented in Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n \n11.  Unquantified Benefits. In addition to the quantifiable benefits mentioned earlier, there \nare a number of benefits that cannot be readily quantified. First, although progress has been \nmade in recent years, poverty remains a critical problem in the project provinces. The Project \nwill  contribute  significantly  to  easing  the  poverty  of  labor  wage  earners  by  increasing  the \nemployment availability and wages in local areas. This will reduce the social and financial costs \notherwise incurred by family members who are forced to migrate to other provinces to earn a ", "  Appendix 10    57          \nliving. While the benefits from poverty reduction can be quantified, these may be overestimated \nbecause they may also accrue to factors other than the project interventions.  \n \n12.  Second, although not readily quantifiable, health benefits are expected to be significant, \nbecause the project interventions will contribute to reduced cases of food poisoning caused by \nvegetables, tea, and fruits.6 These benefits can be divided into two categories, resource cost \nsavings (i.e., a reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care), and productivity gains (i.e., \na reduction in time lost to illness that would have otherwise have been utilized in income \ngenerating activities). Improvement of community health in the project area will significantly \nreduce the number of labor days lost due to illness (directly or through caretaking of relatives). \n \n13.  Third, the Project will help build capacity for local stakeholders, including provincial \nmanagement  agencies  responsible  for  quality  and  safety,  district  people\u2019s  committees, \ncommune people\u2019s committees, and other public utility entities. Benefits will mainly come from \nproject technical assistance in planning, management, operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nsafe agricultural zones, and certification of marketable products as well as entities along the \nfarm-to-market system. Improved planning and zoning will be essential to efficiency increases. If \ninvestment is not planned in an appropriate manner before implementation, waste may be very \nhigh. Improvement in management of O&M activities will also save annual O&M costs, whether \nthey are borne by the Government or by farmers. \n \n14.  Fourth, in addition to pecuniary benefits, adopting IPM and GAPs will create a practical \nforum for farmers to exchange experiences, skills and techniques and assist them in adopting \nnew, more efficient farming techniques. Such a forum will further promote production efficiency \nand productivity. Women, as a major source of on-farm labor, will be exposed to new farming \npractices and their roles and positions in society will be strengthened through the acquisition of \nknowledge and skills. In addition, the Project will contribute to increased awareness and change \nthe  mindsets  of  farmers  regarding  the  adoption  of  cleaner  production  practices,  waste \nmanagement, and environmental protection. \n  \nc.   Summary Economic Indicators \n \n15.  The  EIRRs  were  calculated  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  to  determine  their \neconomic  viability  and  serve  as  benchmarks  for  subproject  selection  during  project \nimplementation. The results of the economic analysis for the three sample subprojects are \nsummarized  in  Table  A10.3.  Base-case  EIRRs  range  between  24.8%  and  28.9%,  while \neconomic net present values (ENPVs) are in the range of $163,000 and $206,000, and benefit\u2013\ncost ratios (BCRs) are estimated to be 1.1\u20131.8. These indicators suggest that the three sample \nsubprojects examined are economically viable, with base-case EIRRs well above the 12% cutoff \nrate. As indicated above (para. 4), the economic analysis of the three sample subprojects will \nserve as a representative evaluation of the whole Project. Therefore, the Project is considered \neconomically viable, because the EIRRs exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital for the \nquantified benefits. In addition, there are other social, environmental, and capacity-building \nbenefits that have not been quantified due to measurement difficulties and/or lack of data. \nTherefore, the analyses can be regarded as a conservative estimate of the overall benefits. \n \n16.  Sensitivity tests were undertaken to test the robustness of the analyses and examine the \nconsequences of changes in variables, including an increase in capital and recurrent costs, \n                                                 \n6  According to Dr. Tran Dang of Viet Nam Food Administration in his presentation to the food safety working group \non 28 March 2008, poisoning from microbiological contamination and excessive pesticides in fruits, tea, and \nvegetable products accounts for about 30% of all food poisoning cases. \n   ", "58  Appendix 10   \nimplementation  delay,  and  potential  output-related  risks,  including  the  probability  that  (i) \nproducers may not be fully convinced of the need to comply with national and international \nquality standards, and (ii) incidences of food safety scares related to Vietnamese agro-products \nin major domestic and export markets may dampen the confidence of consumers.  \n \nTable A10.3: Summary Economic Indicators for \nThree Production Subprojects \n \nUnit: $\nTea  --- Cases ENPV BCR EIRR SI (ENPV) SV(ENPV)\n0.

The tests were undertaken with the following variables: (i) increase of 10% in the capital \ncost, (ii) increase of 10% in recurrent costs, (iii) decrease of 10% in benefits, (iv) decrease of \n20%  in  benefits,  (v)  decrease  of  30%  in  benefits,  and  (vi)  2-year  delay  in  benefits.  The \nsensitivity tests indicate that the subprojects are highly sensitive to reduced benefits due to \nlower market demand and delays in project implementation (and hence realization of benefits). \nThe sensitivity analysis results for the three sample subprojects are outlined in Table A10.3. \n \n3.   Biogas Development Operation \n \na.   Biogas Development Operation Description \n \n18.  The biogas development operation aims to reduce hazards associated with livestock \nwaste in agricultural areas, thereby reducing negative environmental impacts (i.e., pollution of \nwater, soil, and air) affecting the quality and safety of agricultural products as well as public \nhealth in the project area. The proposed operation will support the construction of biogas \ninfrastructure, a credit facility for household construction of biogas digesters, and strengthening \nof applied biogas research services. The Project will finance the construction of about 40,000 \nhousehold biogas digesters in 16 project provinces through subloans from partner financial \nintermediaries. Households with demand for biogas credit will be screened and selected by the \nfinancial intermediaries on terms and conditions agreed between the Government and ADB. ", "  Appendix 10    59          \nb.   Benefits of Biogas Operation \n \n19.  Quantified Benefits. The biogas operation has numerous benefits including energy cost \nsavings, production of bio-slurry (a safe organic fertilizer), and reduced environmental pollution \nlevels in water, air, and soil. However, only the cost savings from the substitution of biogas for \nfirewood, kerosene, coal, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking and lighting are used to \nestimate the incremental benefits of the biogas operation. The Project will contribute to energy \nsavings  among  rural  households  because  the  biogas  from  the  digesters  will  serve  as  an \nalternative energy source for cooking and lighting. Detailed estimates of the costs and benefits \n(financial and economic) of the biogas operation are presented in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n20.  Unquantified Benefits. There are benefits that are not readily quantifiable. First, though \nno empirical, on-field evidence has been collected regarding the incremental impact on crop \nyields in Viet Nam of bio-slurry versus untreated manure, bio-slurry is considered to be a safer \norganic fertilizer than untreated manure. While farmers currently use manure for their crops, it is \nconsidered unsafe for water, air, and soil. Second, levels of water, air, and soil pollution will be \nreduced  through  the  installation  and  operation  of  biogas  digesters.  The  proposed  biogas \ndevelopment operation will reduce CO emissions by an equivalent of about 40,000\u201360,000 tons \n2 \nof CO  per annum.  \n2\n \nc.   Summary Economic Indicators \n \n21.  The EIRR was estimated for the biogas development operation together with a schedule \nof sensitivity analyses, as summarized in Table A10.4. The base-case EIRR is estimated at \n26.5% while the ENPV is D273 billion (equivalent to $17 million), and the BCR is estimated at \n1.6. These indicators suggest that, other things being equal, the biogas development operation \nis economically viable, since EIRRs in base cases are well above the cut-off rate of 12%. \nTherefore, the biogas development operation is considered economically viable since the EIRRs \nexceed the economic opportunity cost of capital for the benefits that have been quantified. \nSensitivity tests were undertaken to test the robustness of the analyses and examine the \nconsequences of changes in various variables, including increased capital and recurrent costs, \nand a delay in biogas digester construction. The tests indicate that the biogas operation is highly \nsensitive to delays in household construction of biogas digesters and hence realization of \nbenefits.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe agriculture sector continues to play an important economic role in achieving sustainable and equitable growth and in the \nalleviation of rural poverty. In Viet Nam, the agriculture sector accounts for about 21% of the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct, and employs about 57% of the labor force, although these shares are expected to decrease due to relatively more \nrapid growth in the industry and service sectors. Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 presents 15 tasks \nto sustain the rapid pace of economic development and large reductions in poverty. One task is to modernize agriculture, \nincluding improving product quality to attain more comprehensive rural development, through the review and development of \nstandards for  product quality to protect consumers, guarantee the prestige of Vietnamese farm  products, and focus \ninvestment in irrigation, transport, clean water and adoption of improved varieties. Other tasks include enhancing the \ndevelopment  of  disadvantaged  regions  and  areas  with  ethnic  minorities,  implementing  disease  prevention  programs, \npromoting special policies in support of production, harmonizing development with environmental protection, and creating \nconditions favorable to women in from economic perspective.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nKey Issues  \nThe project will be implemented in 16 provinces. It covers a complete supply-and-demand chain: the provinces are mainly \nagricultural producers, while the three cities (Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang) are the country\u2019s biggest consumers. The \naverage poverty rate in the 14 provinces was 17.5% in 2006, above the national rate of 16.0%. The poverty rate in Son La \nwas highest (39%). It is among the six project provinces with ethnic minority groups. \n  \nThe Project is classified as a \u201cgeneral intervention\u201d as it is intended to contribute to the county\u2019s sustainable, pro-poor \nagricultural growth by increasing the competitiveness of agriculture and agro-based products. However, the overall poverty \nreduction impact of the Project is considered positive, given the large proportion of the poor engaged in the agriculture sector. \nIncomes associated with crop growing are projected to increase as a result of higher product value, improved crop varieties, \nbetter infrastructure support, reduced need for chemical fertilizers and increased post-harvest employment opportunities. \nThose agriculturalists engaged in livestock raising will have reduced cooking fuel expenses and save time spent collecting \nfirewood and disposing of animal waste. As consumers, beneficiaries will benefit from safer food and lower disease risks, \nwhich translate to reduced medical care and lost productive time.   \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues.  \n1.  Lack of capital. Lack of capital for investment is often cited as an obstacle that has contributed to the difficulty faced by \nfarmers in buying high quality agro-inputs, including seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, which are essential for safe \nagricultural production. In addition, safe production requires additional investments in infrastructure, such as provision of \na clean water source and greenhouses. The Project, through its interventions to provide supporting infrastructure in \nSAZs, will ensure that such food quality and safety-related facilities are installed in the selected provinces. \n2.  Low quality pesticides. Farmers in Ha Tay reported that they fall victim during each crop season to low quality or \ncounterfeit pesticides. After spraying pesticides with little or no effect, farmers frequently buy other types of pesticides \nand spray again. Such a process not only result in high levels of residual chemicals on foliage and/or fruits, it reduces the \ntime period between the final application and harvesting. To enable farmers to comply with Viet Nam good agricultural \npractices, criteria for guaranteeing good-quality pesticides and other agro-inputs will be established. \n3.  Lack of knowledge of and incentives to follow safe production processes and marketing. Many farmers are \nfamiliar with IPM techniques, but lack understanding of the entire safe production process. Many believe that the use of \npesticides is the sole source of food contamination. Lack of knowledge and experience regarding safe marketing is \nanother constraint that needs to be addressed. Moreover, there is a common perception that safe production will require \nadditional investments and/or expenses, such as additional investment in infrastructure, labor, and time required for each \ncrop season. Therefore, farmers believe that the extra cost involved in producing safe food cannot be recovered, as they \nhave to sell products at prices not significantly different from those of unsafe products. There is also a belief that safe \nagricultural products (especially vegetables) usually appear less attractive than do unsafe products. The project training ", "  Appendix 11    61          \nprogram will take into account and address their perceptions. \n4.  Need to coordinate among farmers. Farm households are presently estimated to have 0.3\u20130.5 hectares of land, \ncomposed of an average of seven different plots of land scattered in different places. This situation has resulted in poor \nwork rate efficiency and made it impossible to improve economies of scale. The Project will promote consolidation of \nsmall agricultural plots, which will require organization and coordination to strengthen cooperation among farmers with \nsmall fragmented landholdings. The Government has a scheme to waive transfer fees for farm property aggregation, and \nthe Project will ensure such an incentive scheme will be implemented in the project area. Support will also be provided for \nintra-community consultation and negotiation between farmers to ensure optimal social outcomes.  \n5.  Greater number of women involved in agricultural activities. Numerous studies in Viet Nam indicate that agricultural \nwork is undertaken primarily by women. The Project will help female farmers avoid production hazards associated with \nexcessive use of pesticides and chemicals, and provide them with technical assistance to improve productivity and \nsubsequently farm incomes. Project activities will also target women farm workers through extension, training and other \ntypes of technical support. \n6.  Ethnic minorities in the Project area: Ethnic minorities are present in all provinces and centrally run cities covered by \nthe Project. They constitute an average of 16% of rural households in those provinces. Provinces with relatively higher \nproportions of ethnic minority groups are: Lam Dong (28%), Son La (88%), Thai Nguyen (29%), and Yen Bai (58%). In \nthe six consultation meetings conducted among various minority groups, there was a unanimous expression of support \nfor the Project. It was pointed out that the Project will resolve such issues as the high dependence on chemical fertilizers, \ninability to demand higher prices for agricultural products, and the inconvenience of using fuel wood for cooking.  A large \nnumber of households tend to be involved mainly in subsistence production, with limited market interaction. Their \nunfamiliarity with the market and limited need for it may reduce the attraction of higher production and income as \nincentives to adopt new methods and technology. Project-related training will take this into account.     \n  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \nEleven consultation meetings were held, attended by a total of 81 people, or an average of 7 or 8 people per meeting. About \n41% of the participants were women. Five of these meetings were conducted among ethnic minorities. One meeting was \nconducted among women.   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing           Consultation      Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?    Yes      No  \n \nA C&P plan will be prepared with technical assistance at the beginning of project implementation. The social development \nspecialist (3 person-months) will lead consultation and participatory activities in the planning of subprojects, among other \ntasks. The C&P plan will ensure that:      \n1.  beneficiaries, including ethnic minorities and women, are represented in decision-making bodies; \n2.  information dissemination activities will be conducted among stakeholders for each subproject, detailing the benefits and \nschedule of implementation, and highlighting potential positive and adverse effects and impacts;  \n3.  consultations will be carried out in the design, implementation and monitoring of the subprojects;  \n4.  project personnel and contractors will receive orientation regarding participatory activities, gender awareness and ethnic \nminorities; and  \n5.  women and ethnic minorities will form part of the groups who will undertake surveys and impact evaluations.  Beneficiaries \nwill be consulted during project monitoring to validate data and express their views and suggestions  on  implementation-\nrelated issues.       \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nViet Nam has a long tradition of promoting gender equality, and one of the highest economic participation rates of women in \nthe world (83%). Women are intended to be the main beneficiaries of the Project. About half of all workers in the agriculture \nsector are women; compared with men, women contribute more hours of labor to cultivation, agricultural processing and \nmarketing of agricultural produce. Women will be targeted and included in the introduction of new technologies and in training.  \nTasks that fall largely within the domain of women include tending pigs, cleaning toilets, gathering firewood and cooking. Their \nparticipation in household decisions on adoption of biogas digesters is vital, as they are most affected. There are limited \nagricultural land use rights certificates issued to women, although the number of certificates issued to both spouses is \nincreasing. Women who lack these certificates face difficulties in accessing credit from formal sources, which may be needed \nif farm and livestock operations have to be expanded to maximize benefits from project inputs.  \n \n   ", "62  Appendix 11   \n2.

Viet Nam has a long tradition of promoting gender equality and one of the world\u2019s \nhighest participation by women in economic activities (83%). Women account for nearly 50% of \nthe total agricultural workforce and for a large share of the total annual new jobs created in \nagriculture. Findings from the project-specific social and gender analyses carried out during the \nProject\u2019s preparatory stage indicate that women in the project area share a number of tasks with \nmen  in  farming,  livestock  raising  and  waste  management.  However,  selling  of  agricultural \nproduce is done exclusively by women and routine maintenance and harvesting are done \nprimarily by women. Physically demanding tasks such as plowing fields and hazardous tasks\u2014\nsuch as pesticide application\u2014are done by men. \n \n2.  Despite  women's  high  contribution  to  household  income,  women  have  fewer \nopportunities to access technology, credit and training. Only 25% of the participants in livestock \nextension training courses and 10% of the participants in cultivation extension training courses \nare women. Women have fewer rights in family decision making and are paid less than men for \nthe same work. The 2002 Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGA) \nrecognizes connections between gender inequality and poverty, and highlighted gender equality \nand advancement of women among its sub-strategies for poverty reduction.  \n \n3.  Following the National Strategy for Advancement of Women in Viet Nam to the year \n2010, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the executing agency of the \nProject, developed the Gender Strategy in Agriculture and Rural Development to the Year 2010 \nin 2003. The objectives include, that by 2010, women account for 50% of all participants of \ntechnical  training,  50%  of  working  people  in  rural  areas  will  receive  gender  awareness \ninformation, and the representation of women is increased to 30% in management boards and \nagriculture and rural development projects.  \n \n4.  This gender action plan has been prepared to ensure gender equality in the distribution \nof  project  benefits  and  to  enable  active  engagement  by  women  in  subproject  and/or \nsubcomponent design and implementation. Gender responsive interventions will be selected to \nrespond to the specific needs of women in the project area. The implementation arrangements \nand estimated costs of the gender action plan have been incorporated into the overall project \ndesign and costing. The gender action plan implementation schedule will be in line with the \noverall implementation of the project.  The key principles underlining the gender action plan are:   \n \n(i)  active  involvement  of  women,  particularly  poor  women,  female  heads  of \nhouseholds,  and  mothers  with  infants  and  young  school  children,  as  both \nimplementers and beneficiaries at all stages of project implementation; \n(ii)  engagement of female trainers and community facilitators;  \n(iii)  promotion of the hiring of women and equal pay for men and women for work of \nequal value;  \n(iv)  establishment  of  sex-disaggregated  indicators  and  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  for  the  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem; \n(v)  awareness training for men on women\u2019s rights and the importance of gender \nequality; and \n(vi)  encouragement of women\u2019s participation in training activities.                    \n   ", "    \n                6\n4\nTable A12: Gender Action Plan   \n \nActivity  Targets  Responsibility \nA\np\np\nOutput 1: Regulatory Framework for Quality and Safety System for Agro-Products  e\nn\nd\nEnhancing  the  regulatory  framework  on  food  \uf0b7  Women comprise 30% of those represented during the consultative  MARD  ix\nquality and safety   process  adopted  for  the  review  of  existing  decrees,  policies,  and   12\nstrategies for ensuring agro-product safety and quality in Viet Nam     \n \n \nStrengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  state  \uf0b7  Female  and  male  staff  of  MARD,  NAFEC  (134),  DARD  (144,  16  MARD and DARD     \nagencies  responsible  for  policy  formulation,  provinces), certified organizations (100), and laboratories (20) will be \nmonitoring,  accreditation  and  certification,  given equal opportunity to participate in training  \ninspection,  laboratory  analysis,  review,  and \n\uf0b7  Target of 30% representation by women in central, provincial, district, \ndevelopment of standards and communication \nand commune training programs \nEstablishment  of  a  (pilot)  crop  food  safety  \uf0b7  30%a representation by women in the crop food safety management  MARD \nmanagement system  system  (including  standing  committee  on  food  safety,  units  within \nNAFIQAD, DCP) from the central (i.e., MARD) to local (commune) level \n\uf0b7  30%b representation by women in positions created for food safety \nspecialists and facilitators    \n \nOutput 2: Infrastructure and Facilities for Quality and Safe Agro-Products \nPlanning of safe agricultural zones (SAZs)  \uf0b7  Local communities will be consulted on the (proposed) establishment of  DARD \nDevelopment of support infrastructure in SAZs  three SAZ model sites and on the location of related basic  public  (16 Provinces)  \nCertification of agro-products and strengthening of  infrastructure (30% representation by women during consultations, with \nprovincial capacity for monitoring and assessment  segregated focus groups).  \nProvision  of  training  on  farm  food  safety  \uf0b7  Women\u2019s representation in model sites will be encouraged (50% of \nstandards-based  practices  to  farmers,  primary \nproject beneficiaries will be women). \nprocessors, and traders  \n\uf0b7  Women\u2019s  participation  in  project-financed  training  activities  (30% \nReplacement  of  pest-  and  disease-susceptible \nrepresentation) \nvarieties with tolerant varieties to improve quality \nand safety of agro-products  \uf0b7  Gender-sensitive training materials in local languages will be prepared in \nProvision of support services to project provinces  close consultation with beneficiaries.
