An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  undertaken,  and \nthe  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was  circulated  to  the \nBoard on 30 April 2003. \n \nThe Project is located in Gansu Province and involves the construction of \nthe 98-megawatt (MW) run-of-river Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant (XHP) \nby  the  Xiaogushan  Hydropower  Company  (XHC);  upgrading  power \nsupply  to  three  poor  townships  (Xishui,  Huazhai,  and  Anyang)  for  more \nreliable electricity directly from XHP; and institutional strengthening of  the \nproject implementing agency.  \n \nCoal-fired thermal power plants are the main source of energy in Gansu \nProvince,  a  poor  inland  western  province.  The  capital,  Lanzhou,  has \nfrequently been cited as one of the cities with the worst air pollution in the \nPRC, mainly arising from coal combustion and desertification. Gansu is in \nthe  process  of  developing  several  needed  clean  energy  development \ninitiatives,  covering  a  spectrum  of  renewable  energy  technologies. \nHowever,  clean  energy  production  is  unevenly  distributed  and  faces \nmany challenges in Gansu. \n \nZhangye City is a poor area of Gansu with a deficient energy supply. Of \nZhangye City\u2019s 1.25 million population, almost 80% are classified as rural. \nOf its rural population, 293,000 or about 23% have incomes less than the \nprovincial rural poverty line. Using the lower range of provincial estimates, \n17,000 persons in Zhangye City can be classified as urban poor. Located \nabout  600  kilometers  northwest  from  the  provincial  capital  of  Lanzhou, \nthe  City  experiences  frequent  interruptions  and  shortages  in  electricity \nsupply.  The  Zhangye  City  electric  network  is  part  of  the  Hexi  corridor \nnetwork,  which  in  turn  is  part  of  the  Gansu  and  Northwest  power \nnetworks.  \n \nThe installed capacity in Zhangye City and in the Hexi grid is too small to \nmeet  the  current  peak  load demand and most of the power stations are \nsmall. In 2001, the Zhangye network experienced load-shedding of 1,975 \nhours,  equivalent  to  3.2  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  unserved  energy \ndemand. The current installed capacity in Zhangye City is approximately \n94.5 MW,  whereas  peak  demand  is  almost  200 MW.  The  Hexi  corridor \ngrid  has  installed  capacity  of  475 MW  against  its  peak  demand  of \n850 MW.  Zhangye  City  is  importing  more  than  80%  of  its  electricity \ndemand  of  about  900  GWh  from  the  Hexi  corridor  network. The power \nsituation  in  Zhangye  City  is  expected  to  become  worse  as  projected \nelectricity  demand  is  increasing  but  no  new  generating  plants  are \nexpected to become operational until 2006. The power shortage is a key \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjectives and \nScope \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\nexpected to become operational until 2006. The power shortage is a key \nfactor inhibiting economic development of the area.  \n \nBoth short-term and long-term forecast methods were used to assess the \ndemand projections. Five initial alternatives using  three power generation \ntechnologies\u2014hydropower, \ncoal-fired,  and  natural-gas-fired\u2014were \npreliminarily  considered  for  selecting  viable  electricity  generation.  The \nGeneration Expansion System Planning (GESP) II model was used to identify \nthe  least-cost  alternative  option  from  the  list  of  feasible  alternatives.  The \nGESP II model identified the 98 MW XHP as the least-cost alternative for \ngeneration expansion in Gansu Province. \n \nHydropower  development  can  increase  power  generation,  improve  the \nefficiency  and  reliability  of  supply  of  electric  power,  and  improve \nenvironmental  quality.  These  will  directly  and  indirectly  reduce  poverty \nand accelerate economic growth.  The Project is consistent with the  10th \nFive-Year Plan, which calls for clean energy development, energy sector \nrestructuring,  and  with  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  accelerate  economic \ndevelopment  in  Zhangye  City  by  providing  reliable  electricity  supply  to \nlocal  agriculture  and  cottage  industries,  and  to  reinforce  the  power \navailability and reliability in the electricity grid. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  environmental \nimprovement  in  Zhangye  City  through  provision  of  improved  access  to \nclean  energy.  The  Project  consists  mainly  of:  (i)  XHP,  a  98 MW  run-of-\nriver  hydropower  plant,  (ii)  rural  electrification,  and  (iii)  institutional \nstrengthening.  \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $87.0 million equivalent, comprising \na foreign exchange cost of $35.0 million (40%) and a local currency cost \nof $52.0 million equivalent (60%). \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $35  million  (100%  of  foreign \nexchange  cost)  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  finance  the  Project.  The  local  cost \namounting to $52 million equivalent will be financed through a loan from \ndomestic  commercial  banks  and  equity  from  Hei  He  Hydropower \nDevelopment Company, Zhangye Water and Power Bureau, and Gansu \nYinlong Construction Corporation.  \n \nThe loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 4 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  (the  fee  will  be  capitalized  in  the \nloan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Agreements.  \n \nThe Borrower of the ADB loan will be the PRC, and loan proceeds will be \nre-lent from the Ministry of Finance to the Gansu Provincial Government \n(GPG) and then to the Zhangye City Government (ZCG). ZCG will relend \nloan  proceeds  ($35  million)  to  XHC,  through  an  on  lending  agreement \nwith  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  loan.  The  foreign \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nExecuting Agency  Gansu Provincial Government \n\nProcurement \n\nPeriod of \nUtilization \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nwith  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  loan.  The  foreign \nexchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  of  the  loan  will  be  borne  by \nXHC.  \n \nUntil 30 April 2008 \n \n \n31 October 2007 \n\n \nGPG  will  be \nthe  overall \nthe  Executing  Agency  responsible \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  XHC  will be  the  implementing agency  to \ncoordinate  and  monitor  all  construction  activities  of  XHP.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  at  XHC  will  facilitate  land  acquisition,  social,  and \nenvironmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  local  concerns  are \nadequately addressed. \n \n\nfor \n\nlocal  competitive  bidding  acceptable \n\n \nEquipment,  materials,  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Items  financed  with  local  currency  funds  will  be  procured \nfollowing \nto  ADB.  Advance \nprocurement action and retroactive financing has been approved by ADB \nin principle.  \n \nInternational  and  domestic  consultants  financed  under  the  loan  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe Project will provide 29 person-months of international consultants of \nwhich  15  person-months  are  for  supervision  of  civil  works,  8  person-\nmonths for supervision of installation, 2 person-months for environmental \nmonitoring,  2  person-months  for  financial  management,  and  2  person-\nmonths for institutional strengthening. \n \nAbout  820  person-months of  domestic consultants  will be  required  for \nXHC and will be funded by domestic financing. Domestic consultants will \nbe  recruited  using  either  ADB  recruitment  procedures  or  government \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  XHC will establish about  three  resident \nsupervision  engineer  offices  for  construction  supervision,  environmental \nmonitoring,  socioeconomic  and  poverty  monitoring,  and  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  reliability  of  electricity \nprovision through the run-of-river  XHP.  XHP will have significant positive \nenvironmental  impacts  in  terms  of  air pollution  avoided  from alternative \nenergy  sources.  The  system  planning  and  least-cost  analysis  show that \nthe  alternative  is  a  109 MW  coal-fired  power  plant.  Based  on  this \nalternative, the avoided emissions were estimated at a yearly average of \n240 tons, 1,910 tons, 1,500 tons, and 366,000 tons of particulate matter, \nsulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxides,  and  carbon  dioxide,  respectively.  There \nare almost no trees and shrubs on the mountains along the river section, \nwith thin soil layers on top of riverside mountains not suitable for grazing, \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nwith thin soil layers on top of riverside mountains not suitable for grazing, \ngrass vegetation is only 15%  in  the  XHP  site,  no  threatened  species  of \nwildlife, and few residential settlements, Project impacts will be minimal. \nProper  construction;  rational  reuse  and  disposal  of  excavated  soil  and \nrock;  proper  treatment  of  wastewater  during  project  construction;  and \nrestoration of construction sites, temporarily occupied land, gravel mining \nand  washing  sites,  and  waste  rock  sites,  will  mitigate  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. \n \nXHP  construction  is  expected  to  generate  peak  employment  of  3,000 \npeople. During the operation and maintenance of the power plant, about \n100 permanent staff will be employed. Improvement of the service roads \nfrom the present dirt track to an all-season road will reduce travel time to \nmarket  and  improve  access  to  education  and  medical  services  for \nisolated  households  served  by  this  road.  The  rural  electrification \ncomponent can provide reliable electricity supply for three townships with \na total population of 24,037, of whom 22,193 or 92.3% are poor, and will \nencourage new small and medium enterprises that would increase output \nand employment.  \n \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project is 7.5%, which is \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital of 4.5%. The  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 23.4%. Sensitivity tests show that both the \nFIRR  and  EIRR  will  be  able  to  withstand  reasonable  changes  in \nassumptions. \n \nXHP will have several types of risks, including geotechnical, hydrological, \nand financial risks. XHC is aware of these risks and adequate steps are \nbeing  taken  to  avoid  or  minimize  them.  It  has obtained a license to use \nthe river for the operations of XHP. Additional intangible risks exist due to \nthe ongoing restructuring of the power sector.  \n \nSensitivity  analysis  has  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  effects  of \nchanges in key variables on the financial and economic viability of XHC, \ncompared  with  the  base  case.  Only  adverse  changes  are  considered. \nBoth  financial  and  economic  indicators  remain  robust  despite  simulated \nadverse  conditions.  Risk  analyses  have  also  been  performed  using  a \nprobabilistic  approach  to  the  perceived  risk  factors  that  affect  the \neconomic  viability  of  XHC.  Based  on  the  weighted  average  of  all \nsimulated  combinations,  the  expected  EIRR  is  well  within  acceptable \nlevels. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f\fI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  to  you  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a \nproposed  loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Gansu  Clean  Energy \nDevelopment Project. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n\nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nEconomic and social development in PRC has been rapid in the last two decades.  The \nPRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $964 (in 2002 values), life expectancy at \nbirth  is  70.1  years,  and  adult  literacy  is  83%.  Government  programs  have  resulted  in  poverty \nreduction, particularly in rural areas. Using the official rural poverty line of CNY947 per capita, \nthe PRC\u2019s rural poor represents  4.6% of the rural population. Studies estimate urban poverty in \nthe PRC at 4.7%. \n \n3. \nEconomic  growth  has  been  facilitated  by  infrastructure  development,  a  crucial \ncomponent  being  energy  sector  development.  At  the  end  of  2002,  the  PRC\u2019s  total  installed \npower was 350 gigawatts (GW). By 2010, it is estimated that total installed capacity will reach \n450 GW.  The  PRC's  electricity  is  generated  overwhelmingly  by  coal  (about  75%).  Coal  use  in \nthe  PRC  entails  high  transport  costs  and  is  characterized  by  low  utilization  efficiency. \nHydroelectricity  ranks  a  distant  second  (about  20%),  followed  by  oil,  gas,  and  nuclear  power, \nwhich  account  for  the  remaining  5%.  Appendix  2  gives  a  summary  analysis  for  the  energy \nsector.  \n \n4. \nThe  heavy  dependence  on  coal  as  an  energy  source  has  resulted  in  substantial \nenvironmental  damage  due  to  pollution.  The  adverse  impacts  of  environmental  pollution  have \nbeen  acknowledged  to  disproportionately  affect  the  poor.  Poorer  households  typically  rely  on \nraw  coal  and  biomass  (e.g.,  wood  and  animal  dung)  for  cooking  and  heating,  and  suffer \naccordingly from indoor air pollution. High pollution loads and energy intensity would be reduced \nif there were a more pronounced shift toward clean energy, energy efficiency, and greenhouse \ngas abatement.  \n \n5.  \nCoal-fired  thermal  power  plants  are  the  main  source  of  energy  in  Gansu  province; \nhowever,  hydropower  accounted  for  41%  of  power  generation  in  2000.  Gansu  is  developing \nseveral  clean  energy  development  initiatives,  covering  a  wide  spectrum  of  renewable  energy \ntechnologies. Installed wind generating capacity is 8 megawatts (MW). Residential solar water \nheaters are becoming more common. Solar photovoltaic and battery systems are used in some \nremote,  off-grid  areas  as  source  of  power  for  small  appliances  (e.g.,  radio  and  television).1 \nBiomass-to-biogas  is  another  potential  source  of  clean  energy  for  agricultural  areas.  Different \ntechnologies have regional applications within the Province, with solar and wind appearing more \npromising  in  the  western  areas,  and  greater  hydropower  potential  in  the  southeastern  areas. \nSeveral small and medium-scale hydropower projects have been commissioned in the region of \nthe  Project,  with  several  more  planned  for  development.  However,  clean  energy  production  is \nunevenly  distributed  in  Gansu.  The  capital,  Lanzhou,  has  frequently  been  cited  as  one  of  the \ncities  with  the  worst  air  pollution  in  the  PRC,  mainly  arising  from  coal  combustion  and \ndesertification. \n\n                                                 \n1  The national solar energy research center is located in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province. \n\n\f 2\n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nDuring  the  2001  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  PRC  Government  requested \n6. \nassistance  for  hydropower  and  clean  energy  development  in  Gansu  province.  In  response  to \nthis  request,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  September  2001  provided  technical \nassistance (TA) to explore the need for policy and institutional reforms for hydropower and clean \nenergy  development,  and  to  examine  the  feasibility  of  investment  programs  as  the  basis  for  a \nproject  in  Zhangye  City  that  could  be  supported  by  ADB.2  The  TA\u2019s  draft  final  report  was \nsubmitted to ADB and the Government in December 2002. An ADB loan Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited  the  PRC  in  January  2003  and  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  for  appraisal  was \nendorsed by the Government on 28 September 2003. \n \nB. \n \nZhangye  City3  is  a  poor  area  of  Gansu  with  a  deficient  energy  supply.  It  used  to  be  a \n7. \nmajor trade center of the famous ancient Silk Road. Of Zhangye City\u2019s 1.25 million population, \nalmost 80% are classified as rural. Of its rural population, 293,000 or about 23% have incomes \nless  than  the  provincial  rural  poverty  line.  Using  the  lower  range  of  provincial  estimates  it  is \nestimated that 17,000 can be classified as urban poor in Zhangye City. A summary of Zhangye \nCity\u2019s approach to poverty reduction is given in Supplementary Appendix A, and a summary of \nthe  public  consultation  process  is  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  Located  about  600 \nkilometers  (km)  northwest  of  the  provincial  capital  of  Lanzhou  (Map  1), the  city  experiences \nfrequent interruptions and shortages in electricity supply. The Zhangye City electric network is \npart  of  the  Hexi  corridor  network,  which  in  turn  is  part  of  the  Gansu  and  Northwest  power \nnetworks (Map 2).  \n \nElectricity demand in the Northwest network is expected to grow at 7% and 6.4% in the \n8. \n10th  and  11th  Five-Year  planning  periods  (2001\u20132005  and  2006\u20132010), respectively. Similarly, \nenergy  demand  growth  in  Gansu  province  is  expected  to  be  6.0%  and  5.7%  for  the  same \nperiod.  The  installed  capacity  in  Zhangye  City  and  in  the  Hexi  grid  is  too  small  to  meet  the \ncurrent  peak  load  demand  and  most  of  the  power  stations  are  small.  In  2001,  the  Zhangye \nnetwork  experienced  load-shedding  of  1,975  hours.  The  current  installed  capacity  in  Zhangye \nCity  is  approximately  94.5 MW4  whereas  peak  demand  is  almost  200 MW.  The  Hexi  corridor \ngrid has an installed capacity of 475 MW against its peak demand of 850 MW. Zhangye City is \nimporting more  than  80%  of  its  electricity  demand  of  about  900 GWh  from  the  Hexi  corridor \nnetwork.  \n \n9.  \nThe  Xiliushui  and  Xiaogushan  hydropower  plants  are  the  two  proposed  hydropower \nstations  on  the  Heihe  river  expected  to  start  producing  power  around  2006  to  2007.  The \nZhangye  City  network  has  two  comparable  but  distinct  peak  demand  scenarios,  winter  and \nsummer. The summer peak imposes maximum demand on the existing network. The summer \ndemand  is  made  up  of  a  larger  peak  mainly  due  to  the  agricultural  (pumped  irrigation)  load. \nHydropower can provide maximum generation during summer months and is particularly suited \nto  alleviate  the  peak  electricity  demand  gaps  in  summer  for  the  Zhangye  City  network.  The \nexpected  energy  balances  excluding  the  import  from  Hexi  Corridor  Grid  in  2005,  2006,  and \n2010  are  -1,015  gigawatt-hours  (GWh),  -628 GWh, and  \u2013914 (GWh), respectively.  The power \nsituation  in  Zhangye  City  is  expected  to  become  worse  as  projected  electricity  demand  is \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001.

With the change in status  from \n\nprefecture to city, the former City area has been redesignated as Ganzhou district. \n\n4  This  includes  8.5 MW  of  coal-fired  capacity  in  Ganzhou  district,  which  operates  only  on  an  intermittent  basis; \n52 MW  at  the  Longshou  phase  I  hydropower  station;  and  approximately  34 MW  of  mini-hydro  at  the  Longqui \nstations 1, 2, 3, and 4, and other small hydropower stations. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nincreasing  but  no  new  generating  plants  are  expected  to  become  operational  until  2006.  The \npower shortage is a key factor inhibiting economic development in the area. \n \n10. \nThe  98 MW  Xiaogushan  hydropower  plant  (XHP)  is  the  least-cost  alternative  for \ngeneration expansion in Gansu province. XHP will represent about 38% of the installed capacity \nin the Zhangye grid and, in the short term, it is likely to dominate the local generation scene in \nterms of ancillary services, peak load, and base-load management. With only 98 MW installed \ncapacity, however, it will not be able to influence the electricity generation tariffs in the electricity \nmarket.  To  ensure  the  ongoing  financial  viability  of  the  operations  of  the  Xiaogushan \nHydropower Company (XHC) in the future, it is necessary to ensure that the overall operation of \nXHC  is  competitive  and  that  its  management  is  well  equipped  to  maximize  the  value  of  its \nnatural advantages\u2014lower transmission losses as it is close to the local load center and overall \nlow-cost  operation  as  a  small  run-of-river  hydropower  station.  XHC  and  the  Gansu  provincial \ngovernment  (GPG)  need  to  ensure  that  the  framework  for  competition  and  regulation  is \neffective,  transparent,  and  predictable.  This  is  to  ensure  a  free  and  fair  competitive market for \ngeneration in the province. \n \nThe  development  of  clean  energy  is  consistent  with  the  PRC  Government\u2019s  10th  Five-\n11. \nYear  Plan,  which  calls  for  energy  sector  restructuring.  The  plan\u2019s  target  is  to  decrease  the \nproportion  of  energy  from  coal  by  3.9%  and  increase  energy  from  natural  gas  and \nhydroelectricity  by  5.6%  in  2005.5  Gansu  province  has  actively  promoted  development  of \nalternatives  to  coal-fired  power,  and  has  achieved  a  high  rate  of  hydropower  development  in \nZhangye  City  (91%  of  installed  capacity).  A  review  of  the  clean  energy  subsector,  and  key \ninstitutional  reforms  and  power  sector  restructuring  activities  are  found  in  the  energy  sector \nanalysis  (Appendix  2).  The  PRC\u2019s  achievements  in  energy  conservation  and  environmental \nimprovement have also been substantial.  \n \n12. \nThe development of clean energy resulting in increased energy generation and  in more \nreliable  and  efficient  energy  service  contributes  to  poverty  reduction.  Poverty  reduction  in \nZhangye  City  is  governed  by  the  strategy  put  forward  in  the  \u201cOverall  Program  of  Poverty \nReduction  and  Development  in  Gansu  Province  (2001\u20132010)\u201d,  developed  by  the  provincial \ngovernment.  The  plan  identifies  the  extreme  natural  conditions,  poor  infrastructure,  and  low \nlevels of human capital as the causes of continued poverty in the  Province. Hence the areas of \ninfrastructure  development  particularly  rural  roads,  electricity  supply,  and \nfocus  are: \ncommunications; \nimprovement; \nenvironmental  protection,  rehabilitation,  and  improvement  of  existing  infrastructure;  and \nimprovement of the delivery of social services. \n \nC. \n \nOf  11  public  power  sector  projects  financed  by  ADB  in  the  PRC,  four  have  been \n13. \ncompleted.  Project  completion  and  project  performance  audit  reports  assess  the  four  as \ngenerally successful and indicate that these were smoothly implemented. Lessons from ADB\u2019s \nactivities in  the  PRC  point  to:  (i) the  need  to  improve  financial  reporting;  (ii) the need for more \nattention  to  environmental  matters;  (iii) the  advisability  of  using  larger  boiler-turbine  units; \n(iv) the need for rigorous screening to ensure  that projects are in line with ADB\u2019s energy policy; \n(v) the  possibility  of  delay  for  complex  and  multicomponent  projects  involving  several \n\nincreased  agricultural  productivity \n\nLessons Learned \n\nfocused  on \n\nirrigation \n\n                                                 \n5  Hydropower potential in the PRC is one of the largest in the world. Estimates by the Government (Ministry of Water \nResources) place current hydropower resource use at 10\u201320% of potential. In comparison, utilization of available \nhydropower is typically at 50\u201390% in developed countries. This shows that the potential for expansion is large. \n\n\f 4\n\nimplementing  agencies  and  multiple  approval  processes;  (vi) the  need  for  greater  efforts  to \nimplement policy-related covenants; and (vii) the importance of capacity building. A discussion \non external assistance is summarized in Appendix 3 and details are provided in Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n \n14. \nPower utilities have been  weak  in  the  area  of  commercial  and  financial  management. \nOften,  there  is  a  need  for  institutional  strengthening  in  the  areas  of  organizational  structure, \ndelegation of authority, management information and control systems, accounting and financial \nmanagement,  and  personnel  development  and  training.  Recently,  some  ongoing  PRC  power \nprojects  have  experienced  implementation  delays  in  meeting  procurement  and  construction \ndeadlines.  These  are  mainly  due  to  the  ongoing  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  and \nconsequent change in the \u201cownership\u201d of the projects. \n \n15. \nADB  reviewed  and  evaluated  the  cost-recovery  performance  of  the  power  sector  in \n14 developing member countries (DMCs), and reviewed the record of financial covenants by 42 \npower  utilities.6  Through  three  key  criteria\u2014cost  minimization,  tariff  setting,  and  collection \nefficiency\u2014the PRC was one of three DMCs that were  assessed as having the highest level of \nsatisfactory  performance.  Among  the  lessons  in  the  review  of  compliance  levels,  the need to \nassist  DMCs  to  create  new  institutions  with  a  more  business-like  approach  to  utility \nmanagement  was  noted.  ABD  support  should  continue  for  new,  unbundled  utilities  that  have \nadopted a more transparent, commercial, and independent approach. \n \n16. \nThe  above  lessons  have  been  taken  into  account  in  designing  the  Project.  A \ncomprehensive  feasibility  study  was  prepared  during  the  study  process,  and  project \nimplementation  issues  were  given  special  emphasis.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nassist in project implementation, and institutions involved will be strengthened to improve overall \nand  financial  management  capabilities,  and  to  ensure  sustainability.  Local  currency  financing \nwas  structured  to  ensure  an  appropriate  mix  of  debt  and  government  equity.  Provision  was \nmade  for  sufficient  working  capital,  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  financial  and  economic \nperformance  was  undertaken.  Conservative  cost  contingencies  have  been  used  to  avoid  loan \nsurpluses.  Technical  aspects  were  carefully  reviewed  and  project  alternatives  were  examined \nprudently.  Project  design  has  carefully  considered  environmental  and  social  aspects  and  has \nensured that the Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s energy and environment policies.  \n \n \n\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n17. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  environmental  improvement  in \nZhangye  City  through  provision  of  improved  access  to  clean  energy.  The  Project  targets  the \nHexi grid in terms of electricity provision, and the townships of Xishui, Huazhai, and Anyang for \nrural  electrification.  The  Project  also  aims  to  provide  support  for  institutional  strengthening  in \nimplementing  agency  (IA).  The  Project  is  located  in  Gansu  province  and  comprises  the \nconstruction  of  a  98 MW  run-of-river  XHP  by  XHC;  upgrading  power  supply  to  three  poor \ntownships  for  more  reliable  electricity  directly  from  XHP;  and  institutional  strengthening  of  the \nIA. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Special Evaluation Study of Cost Recovery in the Power Sector. Manila. \n\n\f \n\nB. \n \n18. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe proposed Project components are as follows. \n\n1. \n\nXiaogushan Hydropower Plant (98 MW) \n\n5\n\n \n19. \nThe XHP component includes all necessary civil works and equipment to complete the \n98 MW facility (2 x 40 MW plus 1 x 18 MW) and connect it to a 110 kilovolt (kV) intermediate (or \nservice)  substation.  This  interconnection  point  is  assumed  to  be  the  \u201cpoint  of  sale\u201d.  XHP \ncomprises the following subcomponents: (i) civil works, (ii) service road improvement, (iii) power \nplant  equipment,  (iv)  hydro-mechanical  equipment  and  metal  structures,  (v)  environmental \nmanagement, (vi) construction utilities, (vii) transmission lines  (27 km) to the 110  kV substation \nto be constructed adjacent to the downstream Longshou phase II project, and (viii) design and \nsupervision.  XHP  is  a  key  energy  development  project  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  of  Zhangye \nCity,  and  is  consistent  with  continued  sustainable  growth  of  the  renewable  energy  subsector. \nMore details of run-off-river power plant is provided in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n2. \n\nRural Electrification \n\n \n20. \nThis  component  includes  construction  of  a  35  kV  line  in  association  with  XHP,  and  a \n35 kV  line  to  transmit  electricity  after  the  completion  of  the  Project  to  Xishui,  Huazhai  and \nAnyang townships. A majority of the people living in these townships are considered to be poor \nand they will receive more reliable electricity directly from XHP. \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n \n21. \nInstitutional strengthening has been included as a separate component for the Project. \nExtensive  discussions  with  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  IA  reflect  the  strong  need  for \nbuilding the capacity of the IA. It should be noted that XHC is a new project company created to \nundertake the development of the Project. Further, if the Project is approved, it will be the first \nADB-supported  loan  in  Gansu  province.  In  view  of  this,  it  is  envisaged  that  the  institutional \nstrengthening component  will  ensure  that  the  IA  will  have  sufficient  capacity  to  implement  the \nProject.  The  component  is  also  designed  to  bring  sustainable  benefits  which  will  improve  the \nmanagement of XHC for increased efficiency. \n \n22. \nCentral  to  the  institutional  strengthening  effort  is  support  for  project  management, \nfinancial  management,  enterprise  reforms  and \nprocurement  and  contract  supervision, \ngovernance,  human  resources  development,  performance  management,  environmental \nmonitoring,  and  energy  efficiency  improvement  activities.  The  Project  will  provide  training  and \nconsulting  services  in  these  areas.  Both  local  and  foreign  training  programs  will  be  developed \nfor  skills  development.  Beyond  training,  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  aide  the \nimprovement  of  XHC,  and  project  design  has  incorporated  elements  that  will  support \ninstitutional  strengthening.  For  example,  the  development  of  a  financial  management \ninformation  system  is  included  in  the  institutional  strengthening  component  to  improve  the \nfinancial management and enterprise governance of XHC. To complement this, XHC is required \nto  update \nfor  department/branch  or \nproject/subproject;  introduce  an  annual  company-wide  business  planning  and  budgeting \nprocess;  introduce  a  system  of  project  budgeting  and  costing;  introduce  a  monthly  financial \nreporting  and  review  process;  and  create  post  descriptions  for  all  existing  and  new  financial \ndepartment positions. \n \n\nits  chart  of  accounts \n\ninclude  subaccounts \n\nto \n\n\f 6\n\nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPotential Benefits from Clean Development Mechanism \n\n \nThe  Fact-Finding  Mission  had  extensive  dialogue  with  the  Government,  which \n23. \nencouraged the expansion of the environmental  aspect  of the Project.  The  Mission  explained \nthe  processing  requirements  for  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  activities  to  the \nGovernment (Appendix 4). Through discussions with the EA, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and \nthe Ministry of Science and Technology, it was agreed to pursue tapping the CDM potential for \nXHC,  and  benefits  could  be  channeled  as  seed  resources  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  area.  The \nProject  is  a  viable  CDM  candidate,  and  based  on  current  prices  being  offered  for  emissions \nreductions  that  are  yet  to  be  certified,  potential  revenues could  meet  about 10% of  the  total \nproject  cost.  If  the  Project  were  approved  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on \nClimate Change CDM Executive Board, it would be one of the first ADB-funded efforts to assist \nin  bringing  certified  emission  reductions  to  the  market.  A  web  site  (www.xhconline.com) was \ndeveloped to provide necessary information about the Project and potential for CDM activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n24. \nEnvironmental improvements related to clean energy is the strength of the Project. Over \ntime  the  Project  was  developed  into  a  multicomponent  effort  that  would  result  in  beneficial \nimpacts to improve the environment while targeting the poor. The Zhangye City Government\u2019s \n(ZCG)  involvement  to  improve  the  project  area\u2019s  overall  development,  the  environment,  and \npoverty  reduction  plans,  has  strengthened  the  rationale  for  the  Project.  Various  environmental \nimprovement  measures  such  as  closure  of  an  old  coal-fired  power  plant,  mechanisms  to \nharness CDM benefits, and energy conservation activities are included in the Project.  \n \n25. \nGPG  and  ZCG  requested  ADB\u2019s  TA  support  for  the  further  promotion  of  its  renewable \nenergy  program.  The  requested  TA  aims  to  demonstrate:  the  potential  for  renewable  energy \n(RE) commercialization, and the associated poverty reduction benefits of RE applications. The \nproposed  TA  can  build  on  the  experience  of  the  Project,  and  has  the  potential  to  create  self-\nsustaining  renewable  energy  service  providers  with  the  ability  to  design,  construct,  and \ncommission viable RE systems. It has been put forward that the proposed TA would consider \ndifferent  forms  of  renewable  energy  (solar,  wind,  and  biomass/biogas),  consistent  with  the \noverall RE subsector activities in Gansu province. If approved, the proposed TA will benefit from \nprior work funded by ADB7 and will expand on the poverty reduction benefits from the Project so \nthat  the  further  design  of  the  proposed  TA  will  not  replicate,  but  be  complementary  to,  the \nProject\u2019s impacts. \n \n\n3. \n\nMaximizing the Project\u2019s Impacts on the Poor \n\n \n26. \nStatistics  in  2002  show  that  269,452  of  Zhangye\u2019s  983,206  rural  people  (27%)  had \nannual  per  capita  incomes  below  the  Gansu  province  official  rural  poverty  line  of  CNY1,100. \nThe Project area is located within Xishui township of Mati district in Sunan county. Mati is a poor \ndistrict with 3,766  people  or  80%  of  its  population  under  the  provincial  herder  poverty  line  of \nCNY1,650  (Zhangye  Poverty  Reduction  Bureau).  Xishui  township  has  a  poverty  incidence  of \n93%.

XHC  will be  the  IA  to  coordinate  and  monitor  all  construction \nactivities  of  XHP.8  A  project  director,  directly  reporting  to  the  president  of  XHC,  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  management,  approval  of  contracts,  and  payments.  An  XHC \nproject  implementation  unit  established  within  XHC  will  facilitate  land  acquisition  as  well  as \nsocial  and  environmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately \naddressed.  The  unit  is  headed  by  an  XHC  project  manager  responsible  for  physical \nimplementation activities on a day-to-day basis and for the preparation of progress reports. The \npresent simple structure and dual responsibilities of the management staff of XHC is adequate \nfor  current  project  preparation  work  but  is  insufficient  for  project  implementation.

The implementation schedule is attached in \nAppendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n32. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  civil \nworks for XHP is divided into 15 major packages 9 to be procured under local competitive bidding \n(LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Equipment  component  is  divided  into  29 packages and \nprocured  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  and  international  shopping  (IS) \nprocedures  (Appendix  8).  Generally,  for  equipment  more  than  $500,000  and  civil  works  more \nthan  $5  million,  ICB  is  used.  For  equipment  $500,000  and  below,  IS  is  applied,  and  for  civil \nworks $5 million and below, LCB is applied. Ancillary facilities including administration building \nand  service  areas  building  under  domestic  financing  will  be  procured  using  LCB  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Procurement for rural electrification under government financing will follow \nGovernment  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Procurement  for  rural  electrification  financed  by \nADB  will  follow  ADB  procurement  guidelines.  ICB  will  be  managed  by  a  procurement  agency, \nwhich  is  well  qualified  to  perform  these  tasks  and  has  previous  experience  in  other externally \nfunded projects.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all \ndocuments and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n33. \nInternational  and  domestic  consultants  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Project  will  provide \n29 person-months  of  international  consultants  of  which  15  are  for  supervision  of  civil  works, \n8 are  for  supervision  of  installation,  2  are  for  environmental  monitoring,  2  are  for  financial \nmanagement,  and  2  are  for  institutional  strengthening  to  be  grouped  under  four  packages \n(Appendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix F). Overall XHC project supervision will be under the \nresponsibility of the chief supervision engineer\u2019s (CSE) office. The CSE will be supported by two \ndeputy CSEs. One deputy CSE will be the team leader of the international consultants and will \nassist the CSE in project and contract management activities, and certify contractor\u2019s progress \npayments and contract variations prior to their approval by the CSE. \n \n34. \nIt is estimated that about 820 person-months of domestic consultants will be required for \nXHC  and  will  be  funded  by  domestic  financing.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  either \nunder  ADB recruitment procedures or  under government procedures acceptable to ADB. XHC \nwill  establish  about  three  resident  supervision  engineer  offices  for  construction  supervision, \nenvironmental monitoring,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring  (6\u201310  person-months),  and  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n35. \nExcept  as  the  ADB  may  otherwise  agree,  the  Borrower  shall  establish  soon  after  the \nEffective Date, an imprest account at a bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account shall be \nestablished,  managed, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  dated  January  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the Borrower and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited \ninto the imprest account shall not exceed the equivalent of $800,000. \n\nreplenished  and \n\nliquidated \n\n                                                 \n9  In total there are 15 civil work packages , but only 14 will be financed by ADB.  \n\n\f 10\n\n \n36. \nThe  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of \neligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided into the imprest account, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001, as amended from time to time, \nand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Borrower  and  ADB.  Any  individual \npayment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  shall  not  exceed  the \nequivalent of $100,000. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n37. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance  action  to  expedite  the \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  for  civil  works  and  critical  equipment.  ADB \nManagement approved advance procurement action in May 2003. This covers prequalification \nof contractors,  and  tendering  and  bid  evaluation  for  the  civil  works  contract  and  equipment \npackages,  but  does  not  include  the  signing  of  contracts.  During  subsequent discussions the \nGovernment requested retroactive financing for up to $3.5 million-worth of equipment ordering \nand  civil  works  expected  to  be  incurred  from  1  October  2003  to  loan  effectiveness. Advance \nordering  will  allow  XHC  to  start  the  power  generation  work  immediately  after  civil  works \ncompletion. On 11 September 2003, ADB Management approved the Government\u2019s request for \nretroactive  financing.  The  Government  and  the  IA  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  the \nadvance actions or retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project.10\n \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nXHC,  through  HHDC  and  ZCG,  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and \n38. \nrelated financial statements, including (i) a statement of accounting/financial policies, (ii) a cash-\nflow  statement,  (iii) an  imprest  account  statement,  (iv) a  statement  of  expenditures,  (v) an \nincome statement, (vi) a balance sheet, and (vii) notes to the financial statements. The income \nstatements  will  be  started  on  commencement  of  hydropower  operations.  HHDC  and  XHC  will \nprepare  a  set  of  financial  statements  for  the  Project  and  have  them  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors.  The  audit  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  national  auditing \nstandards. XHC will submit to ADB, within 9 months of the end of each related fiscal year until \nthe  end  of  the  project  period,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and an auditor's report for the Project, all in English. During project processing, ADB \nreminded the Government of its stringent requirements for timely submission of audited project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  and  that  noncompliance  with  requirements  may  result  in \nsuspension of loan disbursements.  \n \n39. \nDuring  the  midterm  review  in  2006,  financial  projections  of  HHDC  for  XHC  for  the \nfollowing  5  years  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  its  review  and  such  projections  will  be updated \nannually  thereafter.  The  Government  has  agreed  that,  as  in  previous  ADB-financed projects, \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation, including cumulative expenditure for civil works as well as for the entire project. \nIn this regard, XHC/HHDC will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports in such form and detail \nas  ADB  may  request,  and  brief  monthly  updates.  To  facilitate  postevaluation  of  the  Project, \nXHC/HHDC  will  furnish  to  ADB, within  3  months  of  project  completion,  a  project  completion \n\n                                                 \n10  XHC has undertaken CNY82 million-worth of preconstruction work such as construction of access road, temporary \nbuildings, slope stabilization, water and electricity supply for construction work. However, these could not qualify \nfor  advance  procurement  or  retroactive  financing  due  to  lack  of  compliance  with  ADB  guidelines  regarding \nprocurement. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nreport  providing  details  regarding  physical  implementation,  project  costs,  recruitment  and \nperformance  of  consultants,  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works,  performance  of  suppliers \nand contractors,  resettlement  compliance,  social  and  environmental  impacts,  project  financial \nand  economic  performance,  and  other  details  as  requested  by  ADB.  A  summary  of  financial \nperformance and projections is presented in Appendix 10. In addition, XHC/HHDC will provide \nADB  with  reports  on  contract  management  procedures  (including  approval  of  variation  orders \nand  progress  payment  certificates),  proposed  tariff  increases,  benefit  monitoring,  and  other \nactivities within the required time as stipulated in the Loan and Project Agreements.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n \n40. \nDuring  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  provincial and \nlocal government officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was \nadded to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB's \nprogram for the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide incentives to \nreduce  the  incidence  of  corruption  in  the  longer  term.  In  1998,  an  ADB  TA11  helped  the \nGovernment  develop  detailed  guidelines  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants, \naimed  to  increase  transparency,  take  account  of  the  principles  of  ADB's  anticorruption  policy, \nand  provide  for  equal  opportunity  competition.  The  resulting  guidelines  were  well received by \nthe  Government.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in  strengthening  its  auditing  system  to \nconform to the requirements of the Audit Law and international auditing standards.12 These TAs \nstrengthen the Government's ability to detect fraud and corruption, and ensure  transparency in \nthe procurement process. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n41. \nA set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, \noutputs, and conditions  have  been  prepared.  Indicators will be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation and will include (i) economic development and poverty indicators for Gansu and \nthe project area, (ii) energy indicators for Gansu and the project area, (iii) electricity and tariffs, \n(iv) load shedding incidences, (v) financial sustainability of XHC/HHDC, (vi) per capita incomes \nin the project county and townships, (vii) access to social services in the project area, (viii) jobs \ncreated  in  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  project,  and  (ix)  environmental  indicators. \nEmployment  impact  indicators  will  include  information  about  unskilled  laborers,  poor  laborers, \nand  women  laborers,  and  will  be  monitored  through  the  biannual  progress  report.  At  the \nbeginning of project implementation, XHC  and ZCG  will establish baseline and target values for \nthe  indicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at  project  completion  and  3  years  later,  and \ncompared with the baseline. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender. XHC \nand ZCG  will recruit a qualified consultant using its own funds for monitoring and evaluation to \nhelp  establish  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  and  train  the  IA  staff  in  its  use.  Main \nsources  of  data  used  include  (i) a  review  of  secondary  data  from  government  sources,  (ii) a \nhousehold socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory  rural  appraisal  with  the  help  of \nnongovernment  organizations  in  communities  affected  by  XHP,  rural  electrification,  and  social \ndevelopment  activities.  A  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at  inception, \ncompletion, and  3  years  later  will  be  submitted  to  ADB.  A  draft  PAM  will  be  prepared  and \ndiscussed  with  the  EA,  and  form  part  of  the  memorandum  of  understanding  for  project \nimplementation. \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 1998. TA to PRC for Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants. Manila. \n12  ADB. 1998. TA to PRC for Strengthening the Government Auditing System.  Manila. TA assisted in (i) formulating \n\ngovernment auditing standards, and (ii) designing and implementing an audit training program. \n\n\f 12\n\n \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\na. \n\nImplementing Agency\u2019s Financial Management \n\n \n42. \nA  review  of  XHC/HHDC\u2019s  financial  management  was  undertaken  during  project \nprocessing  (Appendix  11  and  Supplementary  Appendix  G).  Institutional  strengthening  is \nrequired to move XHC toward international best practice in commercial management. XHC will \nupdate  its  chart  of  accounts  to  include  a  subaccount  for  department/branch  (for  each \nadministrative or operational functional department) or project/subproject (for each construction \nor  other  project  element).  Supported  by  changes  to  the  chart  of  accounts,  XHC  will  introduce \n(i) an  annual  company-wide business planning and budgeting process,  (ii) a system of project \nbudgeting  and  costing,  and  (iii) a  monthly  financial  reporting  and  review  process.  Post \ndescriptions should be created for all existing and new financial department positions. Each post \ndescription  should  clearly  specify  functional  responsibilities,  skills  required  to  meet  these \nresponsibilities, and qualifications and experience required. \n \n43. \nTo  build  XHC\u2019s  financial  management  capacity,  skills  training  programs  will  be \nimplemented. The training program will be designed for XHC, and delivered through a suitably \nqualified  expert  in  the  field.  Such  training  may  also  be  extended  to  include  relevant  financial \ndepartment staff within HHDC, as appropriate, and as capacity allows. Clerical accounting skills \nand financial reporting skills in accordance with  PRC Accounting Standards are best addressed \nthrough  accounting  courses  provided  by  local  tertiary  institutions.  Additional  training  to \nstrengthen  the  skills  of  the  financial  department  staff,  and  a  course in  financial management \nprinciples should be conducted for the board of directors and senior management within XHC to \nincrease the commercial acumen of the management team.  \n \n44. \nIt is essential for XHC to design and implement its own set of financial management and \naccounting policies and procedures, written to address the specific context of the company and \nin  terms  that  are  well  understood  by  all  relevant  management  and  staff.  XHC\u2019s  first  priority  in \nmanagement  information  systems  development  should  focus  on  the  implementation  of  an \neffective  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS).  A  critical  success  factor  for  the \ncompany will be the ability to plan and manage financial performance. To achieve this, an FMIS \nwill be implemented so that the company will be able to rigorously monitor and control business \nperformance on a regular basis.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Measures \n\n \n45. \nA  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  covering  the  environmental \nanalysis,  including  environmental  benefits,  adverse  effects,  and  recommended  mitigation  and \nmonitoring measures related to the construction and operation of  XHP has been prepared and \nwas circulated to the  ADB Board on 30 April 2003. The SEIA  was based on an environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  report  prepared  by  the  Gansu  Environment  Protection  Research \nInstitute, which was reviewed and approved by the Gansu Environment Protection Bureau. XHC \nsubsequently requested the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) to review the \nEIA  and,  based  on  this  review,  the  EIA  level  was  elevated  from  grade  III  to  II.  Additional  air, \nwater,  and  aquatic  biota  tests  were  conducted.  The  Gansu  Environmental  Protection  Bureau, \nthe  Forest  Bureau, and subsequently SEPA  approved the EIA with  a  final effective date  of  21 \nApril 2003. \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nc. \n\nSocial Issues  \n\n \n46. \nActivities  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  were  carried  out  in  a  participatory  manner. \nThe consulted parties include township government and electricity distribution company officials \nof  six  townships,  and  selected  households,  schools,  local  enterprises,  and  irrigation  pumping \nstations  to  verify  information  from  higher-level  official  sources  and  develop  a  social  profile  of \nrural townships. The six townships were: Xishui township in Mati district, and Anyang, Huazhai, \nGanjing,  Longqu,  and  Xidong  townships  in  Ganzhou  district.  In  extended  interviews  with \nofficials,  the  role  of  electricity  and  electricity  problems  in  the  project  area  and  the  differential \ntariffs charged to different classes of consumer were explored. \n \n47. \nResettlement. XHP will permanently occupy 28 hectares (ha) of land, most of which is \ncurrently unused and about 10 ha is grassland. Only 2 households (17 persons) are affected by \npermanent loss of grassland rights, animal sheds, or trees, for which compensation has already \nbeen  paid.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily  occupy  26.7  ha  (mostly  unused  land  and  some \ngrassland) for construction camps, borrow areas, spoil areas, and temporary work areas. Four \nhouseholds  (12  persons)  will  be  compensated  for  temporary  losses.  In  total,  only  100  square \nmeters of animal sheds will be affected, and no residential structures need to be relocated. The \nproject components that affect persons are the powerhouse site, 1 km from Bajiaowan village, \nand the widening of the existing road to the powerhouse. The weir and new access road to the \nweir are located along the Heihe river gorge where  nobody lives. There will be upgrading of a \n46 km section of class IV road from Huazhai township to Bajiaowan village.  \n \n48. \nA  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  been  prepared  by  XHC,  a  summary  of  which  is \npresented in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix H. The RP is based on the preliminary \ndesign  study  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households. \nConsultation  meetings including XHC, local  officials,  and  affected  village  leaders  were  held  in \nFebruary  2002  to  establish  the  principles  and  compensation  standards  for  grassland  and \naddress  other  issues.  A  formal  grassland  acquisition  compensation  agreement  was signed in \nMarch  2002  between  XHC  and  Xishui  township.  XHC  has  finalized  the  short  RP  based  on \nconsultation with Xishui township and affected villages. \n \n49.  Minority Issues. There are 32 ethnic minority nationalities in Zhangye City who account \nfor 2.1% of Zhangye\u2019s total population.  Among the total minority population, the largest groups \nare the Yugur (37.1%), Zhang/Tibetan (36.6%), and Hui (15.9%), with the rest of the minorities \nconstituting less than 10% of  the total. Three fourths of ethnic minorities in Zhangye City are in \nSunan, the only Yugur autonomous county in  the PRC. The Yugur ethnic minority is found only \nin Gansu, concentrated at high altitudes around the Qilian mountains. They practice a pastoral \nway of life with herding as the main source, if not the only source, of income. The nationalities \ndirectly affected by the XHP are the Zang in Mati district and the Yugur in neighboring districts, \nall located in Sunan county. Hydropower construction will have minor and very localized impacts \non two villages in Xishui. Despite the large administrative area of 894 km2, the population is only \n1,151.  With  limited  farmland,  most  households  herd  animals  on  mountain  grasslands  between \n1,500  meters  and  4,000  meters.  The  adverse  impacts  on  minorities  caused  by  minor  land \nacquisition will be adequately compensated and are addressed in the short RP. \n \n50. \nThe  local  community  will  benefit  economically  from  its  proximity  to  the  construction \nactivities and later to powerhouse operations. Affected persons are all of  the Zang minority and \nhave maintained traditional pastoral livelihoods. XHC will not cause significant adverse impacts \non the local people, nor will it alter their pastoral way of life. However, during construction, it will \nprovide  opportunities  for  young  people  to  earn  significant  income  for  construction  labor  and \n\n\f 14\n\n \nA. \n \n\nrelated  commercial  activities,  which  will  help  the  villages  reduce  poverty. The Xishui township \ngovernment  will  develop  strategies  to  ensure  that  the  economic  \u201cboom\u201d  can  be  properly \nmanaged  in  a  manner  to  strengthen  the  local  communities  in  harmony  with  traditional  values \nand customs. These approaches  are embodied in a community development strategy and plan, \nwhich is supported by XHC (Supplementary Appendix I). The EA will ensure that the community \ndevelopment strategy and plan are finalized, identifying accountability for carrying them out. \n \n \n\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n1. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n \n51. \nThe load forecast period for the Gansu network was divided into two terms: short-term \n(3 years)  and  long-term  (to  the  end  of  the  system  planning  period  in  2020).  A  bottom-up \napproach or  sector  analysis method  was  used  for  the  short-term  forecast.  Different  end-use \ndemands\u2014primary  (agriculture),  secondary  (industry  and  construction),  tertiary  (including \ncommercial and  service), and residential  (urban  and  rural)\u2014were calculated based on current \neconomic  activities,  policies,  and  impact  of  recent  major  construction  projects  in  Gansu \nprovince.  Three  methods\u2014regression,  linear  time  series,  and  exponential  time  series\u2014were \nused  for  forecasting  energy  consumption.  The  regression  model  used  electricity  tariff,  gross \ndomestic  product,  population,  industry  structure,  and  energy  efficiency  as  independent \nvariables. The historical data from 1986 to 2001 and the short-term demand information (2002\u2013\n2004) were all taken as inputs to the regression model. The estimates of the exponential time \nseries  (GWh 89,788)  and  regression  models  (GWh 90,083)  were  similar,  whereas  the  linear \ntime  series  produced  a  different  trend.  The  analysis  used  the  estimate  from  the  regression \nmodel  and  rejected  the  results  from  the  linear  time  series  (Appendix  13  and  Supplementary \nAppendix J).  \n \n\n2. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n \nBecause  of  the  large  gap  between  demand  (1,400\u20132,000 GWh)  and  supply  (750\u2013\n52. \n1,200 GWh) in Zhangye City, demand-side responses were not considered as full alternatives in \nthe  analysis.  Only  supply-side  options\u2014new  generation  plants\u2014were used as viable options. \nFive initial alternatives using  three power generation technologies\u2014hydropower, coal-fired, and \nnatural-gas-fired\u2014were preliminarily considered for selecting viable electricity generation for the \nprovince. Three fossil fuel generation technologies were considered as technology alternatives: \ncoal-fired thermal (small 300 MW and large 600 MW), and combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT \n300 MW). Technology alternatives, including XHP, were analyzed in detail. Capital and annual \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  for  each  technology  alternative  were  examined.  The \nhydropower and coal-fired power stations were the only two options that showed a positive net \npresent value (using a 12% discount rate). The larger hydropower option was not considered in \ndetail due to project schedule and hydrologic restrictions; the CCGT option was dropped due to \nthe lack of natural gas in the project area. \n \n53. \nFor  direct  comparability,  the  output  of  each  alternative  was  normalized.  Adjustments \nwere  also  made  for  load  factor  differences.  It  was  assumed  that  aside  from  the  benefit  for \ncapacity  substitution  for  XHC,  the  alternatives  would  generate  more  energy  (the  load factor is \naround 68%) to substitute generation from small  coal-fired plants. The latter could not be used \nto  meet  incremental  demand,  but  would  save  fuel  consumption  in  existing  plants,  bringing \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nenergy savings benefits.  The  equalizing  discount  rate\u2014the  rate  at  which  the  present  value  of \ntwo  life-cycle  cost  streams  are  equal\u2014thus  indicating  a  discount  rate  at  which  preference \nchanges\u2014shows  that  hydropower  remains  a  better  alternative  up  to  the  discount  rate  of \n12.85%, after which smaller thermal power  units  will  be  preferable.  Hydropower,  with  its  high \ncapital costs and very low operational costs, is the preferred option when lower discount rates \nare used (Appendix 13).  \n \n54. \nUsing viable technological options\u2014hydropower and coal-fired  plants\u2014a list of feasible \npower plant alternatives was developed, subject to the constraints imposed by the environment, \nriver flow, and geography/geology. Various hydropower candidates were considered (including \nfew-MW  small  hydropower  stations  up  to  large  stations  such  as  the  1,400  MW  Heishanxia \nstation).  The  development  sequence  for  these  hydropower  candidates  before  2010  has  been \ndesignated as  \u201cfixed  scheme\u201d,  because  either  they are  under construction or  there have  been \nother  development  purposes  (flood  control  and  water  supply).  XHP  is  the  only  candidate  for \npower expansion in the period up to 2010 and others, except fixed ones, will be available after \n2010.  \n \n55. \nThe  Generation  Expansion  System  Planning  (GESP)  II  model  developed  by  Power \nEconomic  Research  Institute  of  Beijing  was  used  to  identify  the  least-cost alternative generation \noption  from  the  list  of  feasible  alternatives  based  on  the  demand forecast for  the  Gansu power \nsystem. The least-cost analyses confirmed the robustness of XHP. The GESP II model optimized the \nobjective function of minimum total system cost\u2014capital costs, operational costs, and other external \ncosts\u2014to meet power demand within the defined reliability criteria. The planning period used was \n2002 to 2020 and, in order to reflect the operation characteristics of expansion candidates sufficiently, \nthe study period was expanded to 2050. The technical and economic indices of the power system \nfrom 2021 to 2050 were assumed to be same with those in 2020. \n \n56. \nThree hydrologic conditions were considered: average with 80% probability, wet with 10% \nprobability, and dry with 10% probability. The production simulation was carried out for all hydrologic \nconditions.  The  least-cost  analysis  used  the  weighted  average  operations  cost  based  on  the \nprobabilities  in  the  objective  function.  The  forecast  annual  load  curve  was  modeled  using  three \nseasons: wet season (April to September), average season (October to December), and dry season \n(January to March). Based on historic data, the system peak was modeled in the dry season. The \nfixed  system  included  existing  power  plants   (under  construction  or  decided  generation  plants, \nretirement  plans  of  generation  units,  and  power  exchanges  with  other  power  grids.  The GESP \nmodel  identified  the  98 MW  (351  GWh)  XHP  as  the  least-cost  alternative  for  generation \nexpansion in Gansu province (Appendix 13).  \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project to assess its \n57. \neconomic  viability  (Appendix  14  and  Supplementary  Appendix  K).  The  costs  considered  were \ncapital  costs,  and  O&M  costs.  Appropriate  conversion  factors  were  used  to  convert  financial \nvalues  into  economic  values.  Values  are  expressed  in  2003  local  currency.  The  quantified \nbenefits  of  the  proposed  projects  considered  in  the  economic  analysis  include  incremental \nenergy supply  through  willingness-to-pay  (WTP).  The  EIRR  was  computed  at  23.4%  for  the \nProject.  Environmental  improvement,  education,  health,  and  other  social  benefits  were  not \nincluded  in  the  economic  analysis.13  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  were  carried  out  simulating \nadverse scenarios, and the project EIRR was found to be stable and robust. \n\n                                                 \n13  CDM benefits are also excluded. \n\n\f 16\n\n4. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n \n58. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present value (FNPV) were \nestimated for XHC. The FIRR is 7.5%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) \nestimated  at  4.53%,  and  the  FNPV  is  CNY152.4  million  at  this  WACC.  The  base  case  is \nconsidered financially feasible. Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR is robust under adverse \nconditions  (Appendix  15  and  Supplementary  Appendix  L).  The  financial  viability  in  terms  of \nequity  capital  and  a  tariff  analysis  have  been  undertaken  and  are  shown  in  Appendix  16  and \nSupplementary Appendix M.  \n \n59. \nAn  electricity  tariff  of  CNY0.26  per  kilowatt-hour (kWh) was assumed for  the  financial \nanalysis.  It  is  an  ADB  assumption  based  on  the  discussions  with  various  officials. This rate is \nslightly lower than the tariff  (CNY0.29/kWh) that XHC claims it would receive from the Zhangye \nElectricity Grid.  \n \n60. \nThe FIRR measures the viability of a project. The XHC component\u2019s receipts, payments, \nand net cash flows are for the full project period (24 years) where it is assumed that the receipts \nand  payments  will  remain  constant  in  real  terms  once  a  steady  state  is  reached. The present \nvalue of net benefits becomes zero at a discount rate of 7.5%, which is the FIRR for the Project. \nSince the cash flows in  the  FIRR  calculation  are  post-tax,  the  FIRR  is  compared  against  the \npost-tax WACC of 4.53%. Since  the  FIRR  is  higher than  the  WACC,  the  XHP  component  is \nfinancially  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  remains  robust  when  tested  under \nvarious adverse conditions. \n \nB. \n \n61. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  reliability  of  the  electricity  supply  and  will \nhave significant positive environmental impacts in terms of avoided air pollution from alternative \nenergy  sources.  This  will  have  positive  associated  area,  regional,  and  global  impacts  from \navoided increases in air pollutants. The system planning and least-cost analysis shows that the \nalternative is a 109 MW coal-fired power plant. Based on this alternative, the avoided emissions \nwere  estimated  at  a  yearly  average  of  240 tons,  1,910 tons,  1,500 tons, and  366,000 tons of \nparticulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide, respectively. With almost \nno trees and shrubs on the riverside mountains along the river section, grass vegetation of only \n15% in the XHP site,  with thin soil layers on top of riverside mountains not  suitable for grazing, \nno  threatened  species  of  wildlife,  and  few  residential  settlements\u2014the negative environmental \nimpacts are minimal and can be mitigated. Proper construction; rational reuse and disposal of \nexcavated  soil  and  rock;  proper  treatment  of  wastewater  during  project  construction;  and \nrestoration  of  construction  sites,  temporarily  occupied  land,  gravel  mining  and  washing  sites, \nand  waste  rock  sites,  will  mitigate  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  improved  reliability  of \nelectricity in the project area, ecosystem rehabilitation and expansion, and economic and social \nimprovements will enhance the net environmental benefits from the Project. \n \nC. \n \n62. \nBenefits  to  the  poor  will  largely  be  in  terms  of  increased  economic  opportunities.  XHP \nconstruction is expected to generate peak employment of 3,000  people. During the O&M of the \npower  plant,  about  100  permanent  staff  will  be  employed  (Appendix 17  and  Supplementary \nAppendix  N).  In  order  to  ensure  that  the  hiring  of  construction  labor  will  benefit  local  people, \nespecially the poor and women, ADB  has requested XHC, the Zhangye Labor Bureau, and the \nZhangye All-China Women\u2019s Federation to jointly prepare a labor hiring and training plan for the \n\nSocial and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nunskilled workforce and to ensure that contractors implement the plan. Project beneficiaries and \nthe proportion of beneficiaries who are poor are identified in Appendix 17 and on this basis the \npoverty  impact  ratio  was  computed  at  42%.  XHC  will  also  implement  additional  measures  to \nbenefit  local  communities,  including  (i) hiring  and  training  of  local  workers  for  project \nconstruction,  (ii) provision of water  supply  for  Bajiaowan  village,  (iii) allowing access to project \nfacilities (e.g., medical emergencies, transportation, electricity supply), (iv) supporting purchases \nof  local  supplies  and  services  for  local  communities,  and  (v) utilizing  local  work  teams  for \nupgrading existing roads. \n \n63. \nA total of  98 MW  of  clean  power  in  Zhangye  will  support  the  expansion  of  the  industry \nand  agriculture  sectors  in  Zhangye.  The  rural  electrification  component  can  provide  reliable \nelectricity supply for three townships with a total population of 24,037, of whom 22,193 or 92.3% \nare  poor,  and  will  encourage  new  small  and  medium  enterprises that  will increase output and \nemployment.  The  improved  electricity  will  allow  Xishui  herders  to  buy  crop  residues  from \nlowland farmers, pass them through electric chaff cutters to feed livestock through the winter, or \nstall-feed  more  livestock  (e.g.,  cashmere  goats  penned  to  collect  wool)  year  round.  Reliable \npower would also allow households better access to information (reading at night and in winter, \ntelevision, radio) leading to better social development of poor people in the project area.  In the \nfarmer townships of Huazhai and Anyang, the stable voltage and more reliable electricity may \npermit farmers to pum p water from the irrigation canals to their higher fields thus increasing  the \ncroppable area and reducing the risk of low yields and crop failure.  Improved electricity supply \nwill allow households to process crops. It will allow farmer groups to invest in electric threshing \nand  winnowing  machinery\u2014to  allow  farmers  to  go  away  a  month  earlier  to  work  in  seasonal \nconstruction. In Huazhai township, the improved electricity supply and stable voltage will allow a \n10-bed hospital to use its x-ray and ultrasound machine, presently idled to avoid damage due to \npower fluctuations. \n \n64. \nXHC is also required to pay construction tax equal to 4.12% of annual expenditures, of \nwhich  2.0%  goes  to  local  government  (i.e.,  Sunan  county).  This  revenue  stream  to  Sunan \ncounty  would  be  in  the  order  of  CNY10  million  annually,  which  can  be  used  to  improve  social \nservices and invest in economic development activities to reduce poverty in the county.  \n \nD. \n \n65. \nXHC  will  have  several  types  of  risks,  including  geotechnical,  hydrologic,  and  financial \nrisks, and it has taken appropriate steps to avoid or minimize all  of them. The most crucial risks \nare  floods  and  powerhouse  location.  Site  investigations  have  shown  that  the  rocks  underlying \nthe  XHP  site are of high  strength  and  low  mass  permeability.  Most  of  the  faults  are  oriented \nnormal  to  the  proposed  tunnel  alignment  and  should  only  affect  a  limited  length  of  tunnel. A \ndetailed  assessment  of  hydrologic  risks  is  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  O.  A  potential \nslope failure on the mountain slope above the powerhouse poses a risk to XHP. XHP is located \nin  an  area  of  active  geo-morphological  development  with  steep  natural  slopes  and  deeply \nincised valleys. Above the powerhouse the rock is expected to have a strongly developed joint \nsystem including critical joints dipping out of the hill with possible clay infill. Landslide may occur \nas  a  result  of  a  triggering  mechanism,  such  as  a  combination  of  sudden  rainstorm  and \nearthquake. To overcome the risks, XHC agreed to construct an underground powerhouse.  \n \n66.  Water  use  rights  are  an  additional  project  risk.  XHC  has  obtained  a  license  to  use  the \nriver  for  XHP.  There  is  a  comprehensive  plan  to  develop  additional  hydropower  capacity \nupstream in a cascade system. The Ministry of Water Resources and the National Development \nand Reform Commission approved a planning document that includes allocation of water rights \n\nAssessment of Project Risks \n\n\f 18\n\nin the river basin. The EA has obtained water user rights for operation of XHP from the Water \nResource Bureau of ZCG.  \n \n67. \nAdditional  intangible  risks  exist  due  to  ongoing  restructuring  of  the  power  sector. \nGeneration  assets  will  be  separated  from  transmission  and  distribution,  and  market  pricing  of \ngenerated  power  will  be  introduced  in  stages.  Increased  competition  in  the  power  generation \nsector may depress wholesale electricity prices. In Zhangye City, the demand-supply imbalance \nis  expected  to  persist  for  several  more  years,  as  reflected  in  the  project  financial  analyses. \nAdditional  generating  capacity  is  proposed  for  the  Zhangye  City  area,  primarily  the  150 MW \nLongshou  phase  II  hydropower  plant  (downstream  of  the  project  site).  The  600 MW Pingliang \ncoal-fired  power  plant,  proposed  for  the  Gansu  grid,  would  meet  some  of  the  Zhangye  City \ndemand. Large natural gas-fired plants are not currently planned in Zhangye City. \n \n \n\nV.

The hydropower potential is estimated to be 378 gigawatts (GW) \nof  which  only  83 GW  is  currently  utilized\u2014which  is  about  24%  of  the  total  installed  capacity \nmaking the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) the third largest country in the world in terms of \ntotal installed hydropower capacity. The  potential for small-scale hydropower is also large with \npotential in all regions of the PRC. It is estimated that, among over 2,000 counties in the whole \ncountry,  more  than  1,100  are  suitable  for  building  small-scale hydropower stations of over 10 \nmegawatts  (MW).  The  total  potential  for  medium  and  small  hydropower  resources  is  about \n139 GW. Most of these are located in the vast mountainous areas, which account for 70% of the \ncountry's total land area. The installed capacity of small hydropower amounted to over 19 GW \nand the annual electricity output of 64  terawatt-hours (TWh). Hydropower supplies electricity to \n300 million people in about 800 counties, covering nearly half of the country's area and 70% of \nthe mountainous area.  \n \n\n2. \n\nWind, Solar, and Other Renewable Energy in Gansu Province  \n\n \n2. \nThe  provincial  government  is  committed  to  developing  wind  energy  as  a  sustainable \ngreen  source  of  energy  for  the  province.  Supported  by  a  loan  from  the  Government  of  Spain, \nthe  Yumen  Wind  Power  Station,  the  largest  in  Gansu  province,  with  an  installed  capacity  of \n8 MW,  is  expected  to  generate  about  19 gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  electricity  per  year.  Gansu \nprovince plans to build at least three wind power stations in  5 years, with a combined  installed \ncapacity  of  100 MW.  In  1993,  Gansu  province  designed  a  Rural  Electrification  Project  to \npromote solar electric energy technology to meet the electrical needs of rural Gansu residents. \nThe  project  targeted  poor  households  in  the  province  and  subsidized  about  20%  of  the  retail \nprice of the systems for end users. The project was to install 600 20-watt systems with a battery \nto power two 8-watt florescent lights and a black and white television for two to three hours per \nnight. In addition, several Gansu schools would install larger systems and, on an experimental \nbasis, satellite reception for nomadic herders was also tested under the project. This was done \nin collaboration with the United States Department of Energy and Gansu Solar Electric Fund.  \n\n3. \n\nGansu Province Hydropower Resources  \n\n \n3. \nNine  river  systems  in  the  Yellow,  Yangtze,  and  inland  river  drainage  basins  with  an \nannual discharge of 61.4 billion cubic meters are the main water resources in Gansu province. \nThe combined hydropower potential is estimated at 17 GWh. The province has constructed 29 \nhydropower stations with a total installed generating capacity of about 3,000 MW and an annual \noutput of 11 TWh. Heihe river, the largest inland river in Gansu province, originates from Qilian \nmountain and Datong mountain. The river runs through Qinghai province, Gansu province, and \nInner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region,  and  terminates  in  Juyanghai  of  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous  Region.  Heihe  river  has  hydropower  potential  of  453 MW,  of  which  only  59 MW \nhas  been  tapped  through  Longshou  phase  I  project.  Longshou  phase  II  project  (142 MW) is \nunder construction. Under the Heihe river basin development plan,there are eight medium-sized \nhydropower  stations  proposed,  namely:  Huangzangsi,  Sandaoheigou,  Chouniugou, \nSandaowan,  Dagushan,  Shiyangling  (replaced  by  Xiaogushan),  Xiliushui, and Yingluoxia.  The \nproposed 98 MW Xiaogushan project will be the third operational power station on  the  Hei He \nriver basin development plan. \n \n\n\f \n\n24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nInstitutional Reforms and Power Sector  \n\n4. \nSince  1998,  four  small  hydropower  stations  have been  constructed and commissioned \ndownstream of the Heihe cascade system: Longqui No.1 (3 x 4 MW), Longqui No. 2 (2 x  2 MW \nplus 1 x 1.6 MW), Longqui No. 3 (3 x 1.25 MW), and Longqui No. 4 (3 x 1 MW). These stations \nhave been integrated with the existing irrigation system in Sunnan county, south of the Zhangye \nCity urban center. \n \nB. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided  technical  assistance  (TA)1  to  develop  a \n5. \nplan  for  power  sector  restructuring  in  the  PRC  and  to  introduce  competitive  markets.  The  TA \nrecommended,  among  others,  a  strategy  for  reforming  the  power  market,  optimal  industry \nstructure, wholesale electricity market design options, and  the  preferred design and options for \nmanaging \nthe \nrecommendations in formulating its reform strategy. \n \n\nreliability  and  system  security.  The  Government  used \n\nlong-term \n\n1. \n\nResponsibilities of Power Sector Institutions \n\n \nThe State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), State Development and Planning \n6. \nCommission,  and  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  were  the  key  administrative  organizations  in  the \npower  sector.  SETC  was  a  department  directly  reporting  to  the  State  Council  and  was \nresponsible for state-owned enterprises in the power sector. Its responsibilities were to: plan for \nthe  power  industry;  establish  rules,  norms,  and  technical  standards;  propose  policies  on \nelectricity and heat prices; provide  the primary review of power projects; provide advice on rural \nelectrification  and  small  grids;  and  conduct  planning  for  wind  power.  Each  province  had \neconomic  and  trade  commissions  at  the  provincial  level,  and  the  power  department  of SETC \nwas responsible for  provincial power administration. SDPC was a department under  the  State \nCouncil and its responsibilities were to review and approve new power projects, establish price \npolicies,  and  approve  prices.  It  had  provincial  branches  that  were  responsible  for  the  power \nprojects and price control at the provincial level. MOF\u2019s responsibilities in the power sector were \nto establish and manage the financial system for power firms, establish tax policies in the power \nsector, and protect the value of state-owned assets.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Sector Restructuring \n\n \n7. \nIn April 2002, the Government issued a proposal for power sector reform, and stated the \nobjective of reform as the introduction of competition for efficiency improvements, reduction of \ncost,  implementation  of  a  market-based  pricing  mechanism,  optimal  resource  allocation, \nnationwide grid connection, and separation of government and commercial functions. During the \n10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005),  the  major  tasks  for  power  sector  reform  are:  separation  of \npower plants from grids, restructuring of generation and grid companies, establishment of a new \nregulatory  framework  for  competition,  establishment  of  competitive  regional  power  markets, \nimplementation  of  a  new  pricing  mechanism,  establishment  of  new  environmental  standards, \nencouragement of cleaner power development, study of pilot for direct sales to large users, and \nrural power sector reform. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe  Government  has  established  two  new  grid  and  distribution  businesses:  the  State \nPower  Grid  Corporation  in  Beijing,  and  the  Southern  Power  Grid  Corporation  based  in \nGuangzhou, Guangdong Province. The Southern Power Grid Corporation covers five provinces \nincluding  Guangdong,  Guangxi,  Yunnan,  Hainan,  and  Guizhou.  The  State  Power  Grid \nCorporation  will  cover  the  remaining  provinces  in  the  interim.  Five  regional  power  grid \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

The  key \nresponsibilities of the State Power Grid Corporation will be (i) electricity trading and dispatching \namong the regional power grids, and (ii) participating in the investment and construction of the \nregional  power  grids.  The  regional  power  grid  companies  will  be  responsible  for  (i) managing \nand  operating  the  regional  grids,  (ii) ensuring  reliability  of  power  supply,  (iii) planning  and \nprogramming  the  development  of  the  regional  grids,  (iv) fostering  the  regional  power  markets, \n(v) operating  and  managing  the  regional  trading  centers,  and  (vi) dispatching  electricity \naccording to grid rules. It is understood that the regional power grid companies will be set up  in \n2003. The existing provincial power companies will be restructured into branches or subsidiaries \nof the regional power grid companies. \n \n \n \n9. \nThe Government has abolished the State Economic and Trade Commission and merged \nits  functions  into  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (formerly  the  State \nDevelopment  and  Planning  Commission).  The  State  Council  formally  established  the  State \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  (SERC)  in  October  2002;  with  the  status  of  a  ministry, this \nagency directly reports to the State Council. SERC is empowered to perform administrative and \nregulatory duties with regard to the national electric power sector in accordance with laws and \nregulations. The Government finalized the overall regulatory framework including the objectives \nof the SERC, its structure, and some of the codes and rules for effective regulation. \n\nRegulatory Reform  \n\nb. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nc. \n\nGeneration Sector \n\n \nTo ensure a sufficient number of competitive generation companies in each market, the \n10. \nreform  plan restructured the generation capacities of  the  State Power Corporation (SPC) into \nfive  independent generation companies. Each company is allowed to own a maximum of 20% \ninstalled  generation  capacity  in  each  electricity  market.  The  five  independent  generation \ncompanies are Huaneng Group, China Huadian Group, China Power Investment Group, China \nGuodian  Group,  and  China  Datang  Group.  Some  of  the  generation  capacity  has  also  been \nallocated to the two grid companies for the purpose of safe and reliable operation of the grids. \nOf  the  five  generating  companies,  four  will  hold  a  roughly  equal  share  of  about  30 GW of \ncapacity, while Huaneng will obtain about 38 GW. Figure A2 shows the industry structure. \n \n11. \nCompetition  in  supply  will  not  be  introduced  under  this  reform  plan,  but  a  single \ncorporatized supply company will be established at the national levels. Corporatized generation \nand  transmission  companies  will  be  encouraged  to  raise  capital  in  the  domestic  and \ninternational  capital  markets.  Transmission  and  distribution  will  not  be  separated,  but  internal \nseparate accounting will be established for the two businesses. Grid companies will be allowed \nto  own  pumped-storage  generation  and  other  forms  of  small-scale  generation  as  reserve  for \nemergencies, or for systems support.

These are used mainly in the power subsector.  The  Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  has  provided  11  public  subsector  loans  totaling  $1.34  billion  for  the  PRC  power \nsubsector.  These  include  three  hydropower,  four  thermal  power,  and  two  power  transmission \nprojects, one renewable energy (grid-connected wind power) project, and one pumped storage \nproject.  ADB  has  made  strategic  use  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  prepare  projects, \nprovide  policy  support,  and  build  the  institutional  capabilities  of  power  utilities  that  are  the \nexecuting  agencies  of  ADB  loans.  Among  external  agencies,  ADB  has  taken  a  leading  role  in \nproviding  support  for  (i) corporatizing  power  utilities,  (ii) developing  the  policy  and  regulatory \nframeworks for encouraging foreign investment in the power sector, (iii) introducing competitive \nbidding  procedures  for  the  selection  of  build-own-operate  and  build-own-transfer  projects, \n(iv) strengthening  financial  management  of  power  plants,  and  (v) rationalizing  the  power  tariff \nstructure.  \n \n2. \nThe World Bank is the largest official source of external funding for the power sector. As \nof April 2003, it had provided $5.8 billion to finance 25 power projects, most of which are large-\nscale thermal power or hydropower projects. The World Bank's 2003 program does not include \nany power projects. Its future program is expected to focus mainly on renewable energy projects \nunder the World Bank-Global Environment Facility (GEF) Strategic Partnership for Renewables. \nRecently,  World  Bank  TA  for  the  power  sector  has  been  mainly  supporting  the  Government's \nefforts  to  design  and  implement  detailed  regulatory  procedures  for  deregulation.  The  United \nNations Development Programme is also providing assistance to help the Government evaluate \nvarious options for power sector restructuring and for promoting energy conservation.  \n \nAmong the bilateral sources, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the \n3. \nlargest  source  of  external  assistance.  It  has  provided  concessional  loans  totaling  \u00a5438  billion \n($4.0 billion  at  the  current  exchange  rate)  for  14  power  sector  projects  through  its  official \ndevelopment  assistance  window,  excluding  those  assisted  through  export  credits  and  untied \nyen loans provided by the former Export-Import Bank of Japan. JBIC has also provided special \ncredits to major cities to improve their environment through the installation of emission control \ndevices  and  equipment  in  power  plants  and  factories,  and  through  building  water  treatment \nfacilities. JBIC is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance to the power sector from \nhydro and thermal power generation to energy conservation and renewable energy, particularly \nin  the  western  region.  Germany,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  has  provided \napproximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization \nprojects.  KfW  has  been  also  assisting  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency,  providing  credit \nlines,  and  renewable  energy  development.  Other  bilateral  sources,  mostly  providing  export \ncredits  or  mixed  credits,  include  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark,  France,  Italy,  Spain,  United \nKingdom, and United States.  \n \nTo  address  the  risk  of  overlapping  investments,  aid  coordination  among  external \n4. \nagencies  remains  essential.  ADB  has  established  a  close  working  relationship  with  the  World \nBank in addressing policy issues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and continues to \nexchange  views  with  bilateral  sources  and  the  private  sector.  Both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank \nhave emphasized the importance of improving the management of power utilities, tariff reforms, \nefficiency  improvement,  environmental  protection,  and  a  greater  role  for  the  private  sector. \nDuring  the  processing  of  the  proposed  Project,  discussions  were  held  with  the  World  Bank, \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nLessons Learned \n\nJBIC,  and  KfW  to  ensure  that  their  respective  activities  are  complementary  and  to  maintain \nconsistency in policy advice. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nADB\u2019s experience in the PRC\u2019s energy sector has shown that  its projects are generally \nwell planned and implemented smoothly. Executing agencies and implementing agencies have \npersonnel with good technical skills and have made effective use of the training financed under \nADB  loans  to  build  their  institutional  capacity.  Compliance  with  covenants  is  generally \nacceptable,  although  greater  efforts  are  required  to  implement  the  policy-related covenants, \nparticularly those relating to diversification of enterprise ownership at the micro level in line with \nproject commitments and policy directions. The rigorous government screening of projects has a \npositive impact. Energy conservation projects have experienced some delays, mainly because \nof  their  complex  multicomponent  nature  involving  several  implementing  agencies  in  different \nprovinces. Delays have also occurred for some projects in loan signing and loan effectiveness, \nas  well  as  in  procurement,  construction,  and  commissioning.  The  Government  is  streamlining \nthe multiple approval process to address these problems. \n \n6. \nPower  utilities  have  been  weak in the area of commercial  and  financial  management. \nOften,  there  is  a  need  for  institutional  strengthening  in  the  areas  of  organizational  structure, \ndelegation of authority, management, information and control systems, accounting and financial \nmanagement, and personnel development  and training. So far,  four  of 10 public power sector \nprojects  financed  by  ADB  in  the  PRC  have  been  completed;  these  are  the  Fuel  Conversion \nProject,1  Shanxi  Liulin  Thermal  Power  Project,2  Hunan  Lingjintan  Power  Project,3  and  Henan \nPower Project.4 The project completion and project performance audit reports for these projects, \nwhere  prepared,    indicate  that  they  were  implemented  smoothly,  and  assess  them  all  as \ngenerally  successful.  Some  cost \nincreases  as  well  as  minor  delays  were  noted. \nRecommendations  from  the  experience  gained  highlight  (i) the  need  to  improve  financial \nreporting; (ii) the need for more attention to environmental matters; (iii) the advisability of using \nlarger  boiler-turbine  units;  and  (iv) the  importance  of  capacity  building,  not  only  for  project \npreparation,  but  also  for  training  staff  in  operational  and  managerial  aspects  of  power  utility \noperations.  A  reevaluation  of  the  Fuel  Conversion  Project,  which  was  completed  in  December \n1999,  revised  the  project  rating  downward  to  unsuccessful in economic terms and concludes \nthat  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  energy  sector  should  not  be  narrowly  focused  on  expected \neconomic gains, which may not materialize, and should be rigorously screened to ensure that \nthey are in line with ADB\u2019s energy policy.5 Recently, some ongoing power projects in the PRC \nhave  experienced  some  implementation  delays  in  meeting  procurement  and  construction \ndeadlines. This is mainly due to the ongoing restructuring of the power sector and consequent \nchange \nimplementation \nthe  projects.  Nevertheless, \nperformance of ADB\u2019s energy portfolio in the PRC is satisfactory.6 \n\nthe  \u201cownership\u201d  of \n\nthe  overall \n\nin \n\n                                                                 \n1  ADB.  1987.

(A summary \n7. \nof the lessons learned is given in Table A3.) A comprehensive feasibility study was prepared by \nconsultants.

Given  the  projected  growth  in  demand  and  the \nshortages  in  the  Zhangye  system,  electricity  generated  by  the  Xiaogushan  Hydropower \nCompany  (XHC)  will  be  consumed  within  Zhangye.  Zhangye\u2019s  excess  demand  is  currently \nbeing met by imports of electricity generated mainly by thermal power stations, and the supply is \ntherefore dependent on the availability of surplus in the Lanzhou system. This results in erratic \nsupply and poor quality service, especially for low-end and poor rural consumers. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nSeveral baselines can be considered for the Project, for example: (i) the current power \nsupply mix of the Zhangye grid; (ii) power expansion plans for the Zhangye grid; or (iii) electricity \nimports from the Lanzhou system. Analysis of economic least-cost system expansion plans led \nto defining the appropriate baseline for the Project as the proposed expansion of the Zhangye \ngrid with a new 300 MW or 600 MW coal-fired power plant. The proposed baseline conforms to \nthe  second  approach  approved  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board.1 \n \n3. \nThe  baseline  will  be  an  average  of  860  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emitted  per \ngigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity generated in the system (the equivalent CO2 emissions from \na  300  MW  coal-fired  plant).  This  is  a  conservative  estimate  as  it  does  not  include  efficiency \nlosses resulting from operating a coal-fired plant to meet peak loads. No CO2 emissions would \nresult  from  the  Project  leading  to  net  emissions  reductions  and  rendering  the  Project \nenvironmentally  additional,  as  defined  by  the  CDM  Executive  Board.  The  expected  net  CO2 \nreduction  due  to  the  Project  will  be  348,000  tons  equivalent  (tone)  per  year.  The  Project \ncontributes to sustainable development through: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nuse of local renewable energy resources to displace thermal power generation in the \nprovince, resulting in improvement in local air quality (including indoor air quality); \nincreased local economic and commercial activity through reliable and better quality \npower from a clean and renewable source; and \ngeneration  of  employment  in  the  project  area  and  surrounding  region.  As  noted, \nZhangye City is one of the poorest areas in the province. \n\nCrediting Period \n\n \nC \n \n4. \nThe choice of two crediting periods is possible: (i) a maximum fixed term of 10 years, or \n(ii)  an  initial  term  of  7  years  with  possibility  of  renewal  twice,  provided  that  the  baseline  is \nreviewed  and  updated  for  each  renewal.  For  the  Project,  it  is  appropriate  to  consider  the  first \noption,  with  a  fixed  term  of  10  years,  as  it  lends  certainty  to  the  Project.  Once  approved,  the \nbaseline is valid for 10 years and the Project will not be required to meet the evolving rules on \nadditionality  and  baselines.  Based  on  the  above  assumptions  of  power  generation,  baseline, \nand crediting period, the Project will result in an aggregate of 3.48 million tone of CO2 over a 10-\n                                                 \n1  The  approach  approved  by  the  CDM  Executive  Board  is  \u201cemissions  from  a  technology  that  represents  an \neconomically  attractive  course  of  action,  taking  into  account  barriers  to  investment\u201d  (Decision  17/CP.7  of  the \nMarrakesh Accords, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). In view of the investment barriers \nthe baseline scenario represents what would have occurred in the absence of the project activity. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31\n\nyear crediting period. Table A4 gives the estimated revenue from the Project\u2019s sale of  certified \nemission  reductions  (CERs)  at  $3.00  and  $5.00  per  tone  of  CO2.

The  point  of  sale  is  the  110-kilovolt (kV) \nsubstation, where electricity sales data from XHC will be metered and monitored. The baseline \nemissions  and  the  annual  electricity  sales  quantity  will  provide  the  actual  quantity  of  CERs \ngenerated by the Project. This data can easily be verified with minimal verification costs. \n \nE. \n \n6. \nDonors  such  as  the  World  Bank,  the  United  Nations\u2019  Environmental  Programme,  and \nseveral  bilateral  agencies  are  actively  involved  in  CDM  related  activities  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). Through a stand-alone technical assistance, ADB is assisting small-\nscale CDM project development in the PRC. 2 To develop the Project under CDM, various levels \nof clearances from the Government are required. Upon receiving such clearances, nomination, \nand  other  necessary  documents, 3  the  Project  can  be  registered.  Final  clearance  can  be \nobtained from the CDM Executive Board when the Project fulfils all requirements of the Kyoto \nProtocol. \n \n7. \nEntry  into  force  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  is  necessary  for  any  CERs  to  be  recognized. \nAlthough PRC has ratified the Protocol, overall ratification and effectiveness of the Protocol are \nstill  uncertain.  Despite  non-ratification,  some  Annex  B  parties  have  indicated  several \ncommitments  to  buy  CERs  resulting  in  a  nascent  but  functioning  market  for  emissions \nreductions. For example the World Bank\u2019s Prototype Carbon Fund has developed a  system of \npurchasing  verified  emission  reductions  (VERs)  instead  of  CERs.  There  are  several  other \npotential  buyers  in  the  market  with  the  best  current  offer  price  ranging  from  $3-5  per  tone  of \nCO2.  \n \nFor  XHC,  discussions  have  been  initiated  by  the  Prototype  Carbon  Fund  and  the \n8. \nGovernment for possible sale of VERs. However, at the moment, no other potential buyers have \nindicated  their  interest  in  trading  CERs  with  XHC.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  operation \nlevel,  and  the  power  generated  by  the  Project  with  respect  to  overall  financial  and  economic \nperformance  would  also  have  direct  impacts  on  CER  revenues.

These figures are \n1. \ncomparable with the cost estimates for Longshu hydropower project on Heihe river, completed \nin 2001, and the cost estimates for Xiliushui hydropower project (under construction) on Heihe \nriver.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  findings  note  that  the  construction \nschedule for the diversion structures has no work scheduled  during the wet season or winter \nwhen freezing is a problem.  The costs of materials, labor, and construction have been adjusted \nto include such harsh conditions. The cost of transport to the project site has also been carefully \nadjusted.  The  other  major  features on the cost estimates are: (i) cost per unit kilowatt (kW) is \nCNY7,342, and (ii) loan interest rate during construction is 5.76% with the total financial charges \nduring development amounting to CNY75 million. \n \n \n \n2. \nThe unit prices for civil work construction costs are based on the Gansu province official \nprices.  Methodology  for  calculating  these  prices  are  approved  by  the  Gansu  Water \nConservation  Administration.  It  is  recognized  that  these  are  lower  than  construction  costs \nelsewhere in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) because of economic conditions within the \nprovince.  However,  the  Gansu  Design  Institute  (GDI)  has  advised  that  the  unit  prices  for  civil \nwork  the  construction  have  also  been  checked  against  actual  bid  unit  prices  of  recent \nhydropower  projects  in  the  province,  particularly  the  downstream  Longshou  and  Xiliushui \nhydropower projects.  \n \n \n \nFor  major  equipment,  the  cost  estimates  are  based  on  GDI\u2019s  in-house  cost  data and \n3. \nprice  quotations  from  local  and  international  equipment  manufacturers.  This  is  a  reasonable \napproach.  In  consultation  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Appraisal  Mission,  GDI \nalso  obtained  actual  bid  prices  from  projects  under  construction  or  recently completed (in the \nlast  5  years)  to  finally  derive  the  cost  estimates.  The  ADB  Mission  noted  that  foreign-\nmanufactured  generating  equipment  (of  similar  but  smaller  capacity)  was  provided  at  the \nLongshou  hydropower  project,  and  was  commissioned  in  2001.  In  some  occasions,  project \ncosts were estimated using simple regression analysis for the data from comparable projects of \ndifferent sized equipment.  \n \n \n \nThe  estimate  includes  provision  for  about  2.6%  of  physical  and  1%  of  price \n4. \ncontingencies.1 This could be low considering the current status of the Project and the difficulty \nof  accurately  predicting  tunneling  conditions.  The  low  level  of  contingency  funds  reflects  the \nresults of ongoing policy dialogue on loan surplus in PRC projects. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe proposed ADB loan will have a total loan period of 24 years including a grace period \nof  4  years  and  a  repayment  period  of  20  years.

Other \nterms and conditions for the ADB loan are set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n \n6. \nOn the basis of the cost estimates, Project financing comes from three sources: owners\u2019 \nequity contribution, ADB loan, and domestic bank loan. The proportion among the three is to be \napproximately  16.1%  equity  financing,  40.2%  ADB  loan  financing,  and  43.7%  domestic  loan \nfinancing.  With  regard  to  the  required  equity  contribution,  Hei  He  Hydropower  Development \nCompany  will  contribute  50%,  Zhangye  Water  and  Power  Bureau  will  contribute  30%,  whilst \nGansu  Yin  Long  Construction  Company  Limited,  a  private  enterprise,  will  take  the  remaining \n20% equity. The terms of  the domestic loan from Bank of China, are 15-year repayment at an \nannual interest rate of 5.76%.  According to the preliminary design, it is assumed the funds will \nbe drawn during 4 years in annual proportions of 15%, 40%, 35%, and 10%, respectively.  \n \n7. \nInterest  expense  incurred  on  the  domestic  loan  during  the  construction  period  will  be \nfully capitalized. The loan principal is assumed to be repaid with an annuity each year during the \n20  years  starting  from  the  commencement  of  operation,  whilst  the  associated  interest  will  be \npaid  annually.  For  the  ADB  loan,  the  front-end  fee  is  to  be  charged  once  for  the  total  loan \namount at the very beginning of the loan period. The commitment charge is to be incurred on \nthe  un-withdrawn  portion  of  the  loan  on  a  yearly  basis  as  given  in  the  loan  agreement.  The \nmarket-based floating interest including LIBOR and the fixed spread will be charged annually to \nthe amount drawn and outstanding. The schedule of loan principal repayment, after the 4-year \ngrace  period,  is  prepared  with  installment  shares,  which  are  determined  on  the  annuity  basis \nusing  a  10%  discount  rate  as  stipulated  in  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook dated \nJanuary 2001. \n \n\n\f \n\n34\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTable A5: Detailed Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\n \nComponent \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nA.

The management team should be strengthened by \nappointing  a  dedicated  full-time  general  manager  with  sole  responsibility  for  everyday \nmanagement  of  the  Project.  Similarly,  other  key  positions  should  also  be  the  full-time XHC \npositions for the entire duration of core project activities. Other key areas to be addressed are: \ndefining the purpose of each position (vice presidents, engineering departments, general office); \nclarifying  how  the  Project  will  be  handled  through  the  organizational  structure;  and  defining \nresponsibilities for areas crucial to the Project, such as environment. \n \n3. \nXHC management realizes that the organization structure will have to be improved and \nstrengthened  as  the  Project  advances  from  the  project  preparation  stage.

In the course of the consulting services, the consultants will \nprepare  and  submit  to  the  PMO,  with  a  copy  to  ADB,  the  following:  a  comprehensive  project \nmanagement  plan,  monthly  consultants\u2019  progress reports, quarterly project progress reports, a \nproject  completion  report,  training  program  and  manuals,  and  a  socioeconomic  and  poverty \nreduction impact assessment report.  \n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xv) \n\n(xvi) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n40\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \n\n \n1. \nTables A10.1 to A10.3. The projections are based on notes and assumptions described below. \n \n\nThe financial statements of  Xiaogushan Hydropower Company (XHC)  are presented in \n\n1. \n\nFixed Assets and Capital Expenditure \n\n \n2. \nThe  analysis  is  based  on  new  capital  expenditure  for  the  life  of  the  Xiaogushan \nHydropower Plant (XHP) component. The inflation forecast is relatively low hence, asset values \nare  not  adjusted  by  inflation  to  reflect  current cost in the  annual  balance  sheet. It assumes a \nstraight-line deprecation rate of 3.75%.  \n \n\n2. \n\nWages and Tax Expenses  \n\n \n3. \nThe forecast is made in current terms. Wages and other local expenses are adjusted by \ninflation. It is estimated that about 100 workers will be required to run XHP at an average salary \nof  CNY15,000  per  annum.  This  represents  about  3.48  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  generated  per \nemployee,  which  is  on  the  high  side,  considering  that  for  small  hydropower  generation,  the \nbenchmark figure is about 2.6\u20133.5 GWh per employee. Other employee benefits included are: \nwelfare benefits, 14%; labor protection; 31%; housing fund, 5%; education fund 1.5%; and labor \nunion,  2%  of  salary.  The  Gansu  Tax  Bureau  decided  that  XHC  would  be  entitled  to  a \npreferential income tax rate of 15% until 2010, instead of the general income tax rate of 33%. In \naddition, it will enjoy tax-free treatment for the first  2 profit-making years. XHC will retain after-\ntax profit and no dividends will be paid. Other local taxes include: value-added tax, 17%; city tax \n5%; and education tax of 3% on sales.  \n \n\n3. \n\nAdministration and Maintenance  \n\n \nThe working capital requirement is considered to be CNY12 per kilowatt (kW) of installed \n4. \ncapacity, a standard commonly used for projects in  the People\u2019s Republic of China. The cost of \nmaterials  is  estimated  using  a  benchmark  figure  of  CNY6/kW and administrative expenses as \nCNY15/kW.  A  relatively  higher  figure of  CNY0.0020/kWh for  maintenance is used considering \nthe  remoteness  and  extreme  weather  conditions  at  the  project  area.  Insurance  cost  of  0.25% \nand plant maintenance cost of 1.15% of fixed asset value are used for financial modeling. \n \n\n4. \n\nForecast Quantities \n\n \n5. \nXHC  falls  into  the  price-taker  category.  Analysis  assumes  the  steady  state  level gross \ngeneration  of  366  GWh  per  year  until  2014  and  about  348  GWh  from  2015  onward.  It  is \nassumed that the generation tariff will  fall  by  5%  (real  terms)  in  2009  and  by  10%  from  2019 \nonward.  The  steady  state  generation  levels  are  based  on  extensive  technical  and  hydrologic \nanalysis. Various technical experts\u2019 estimates for average energy potential range from 370 GWh \nto 400 GWh per year. Technical modeling is based on 57 years of monthly inflow data adjusted \nfor the minimum environmental flow of 1.6  cubic meters per second into the river between the \ntunnel intake and the power house. Analysis assumes that the plant will start operation in 2006, \nand  will  generate  about  90  GWh  (25%  of  steady  state  generation)  in  the  first  year  and  full \ncapacity will be realized from 2007 onward. The estimated generation of 351 GWh per year by a \n98-megawatt (MW) power station represents a plant utilization factor of 43%. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTable A10.1: Income Statements \n(CNY

\nonce a year within 6 months  of  the  completion  of  the  previous accounting year.  The meeting will \nhave the functions and powers: (i) to decide/endorse policy and investment plans; (ii) to elect and \nreplace  members  of  the  supervisory  board  (SB)  who  are  representatives  of  shareholders and \ndecide on remuneration and other matters concerning the terms and conditions for all members of \nthe  SB;  (iii)  to  elect  and  replace  members  of  the  board  of  directors  and decide on remuneration \nand  other  matters  concerning  their  terms and conditions; (iv) to examine and approve reports of \nthe  SB;  (v)  to  examine  and  approve  reports  of  the  board  of  directors,  including  XHC\u2019s  final \naccounts and budget, and to examine and approve plans for profit distribution or future actions in \nthe  event  of  loss;  (vi)  to  adopt  resolutions  covering  such  matters  as  bond  issues,  merger, \ndemerger, and liquidation; and (vii) to amend the articles of association of XHC. \n \n\n2. \n\nSupervisory Board  \n\n \n2. \nXHC  will  ensure  that  members  of  the  board  of  directors,  managers,  and  chief  financial \nofficer of XHC will not serve on the SB. The SB must comprise representatives of shareholders and \nmust  have  an  appropriate  proportion  of  representatives  of  the  staff  and  workers  of  XHC.  The \nemployees of XHC will democratically elect the employees\u2019 representative on the SB. The SB will \nmeet  every  6  months  but  its  chairperson  may  convene  additional,  extraordinary,  meetings  as \nrequired.  The  members  of  the  SB  may  attend  meetings  of  the  board  of  directors  as  nonvoting \nparticipants.  The  SB  will  perform  its  duties  in  accordance  with  XHC\u2019s  articles  of  association. In \naddition  to  duties  described  in  XHC\u2019s  articles  of  association, the SB shall receive  reports of the \naudit committee (AC).  \n \n\nFigure A11: Proposed Reorganization Chart \n\nSupervisory Board \n\nAudit Committee \n\nBoard of Directors  \n\nInternal Audit \n\n \n\nShareholders  \n\n \n \n \nPresident \n\nVice President \n\nADB PMO \n\nVice President \n\nChief \nEngineer\u2019s \nOffice \n\nEngineering & \nPlanning \nDepartment \n\nEngineering & \nSupervision \nDepartment \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMO = project management office.  \n\nFinancial Department \n\nTreasury \nDepartment \n\nAccounting \nDepartment \n\nBudget & \nControl \nDepartment \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\nBoard of Directors and Chairperson  \n\n3. \n \n3. \nIn order to benefit from the knowledge and experience of cross-regional and cross-industrial \nboard members,  XHC  will  appoint  a  minimum  of  30%  independent  board  members  representing \nfinance  and  energy  industries.  In  order  to  avoid  any  conflict  of  interest,  the  independent  board \nmembers must be free from any business or other relationship with XHC that could adversely affect \ntheir  independent  judgment.  Therefore,  they  cannot  be  selected  from  any  provincial  or  national \nfinance bureaus, nor from any financial institution, which is a lender to XHC. All staff will be notified \nof any changes to the  board of directors when they occur.  The board of directors will meet at least \ntwice a year and more frequently if deemed required to deal with issues in hand. The directors will \nelect the chairperson from among them based on knowledge and experience in the industry and a \nproven senior management track record.  The main procedural functions of the chairperson are to \npreside over shareholders\u2019 meetings, and to convene and chair meetings of the directors. \n \n\n4. \n\nAudit Committee  \n\n \n4. \nXHC  will  constitute  a  board  of  AC  with  qualifications  and  experience  acceptable  to  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The AC will comprise a chairperson and two other nonexecutive \nmembers, each of whom will be appointed by the  board of directors. The chairperson of the board \nof directors cannot be the chairperson of the AC. The head of the internal audit department will be \nrequired to attend and report to the AC. Principal duties and responsibilities of the AC are to review \nand  supervise  the  financial  reporting  process  and  internal  controls  process  and internal controls \nincluding:  (i) recommend  the  appointment  of  external  advisers,  and  liaise  with  the  advisers  on \nissues such as compliance with accounting standards and other matters raised concerning XHC\u2019s \nauditing standards and internal reporting and control procedures; (ii) review financial reporting and \ninternal control procedures; (iii) review any reports released by the internal audit department; and \n(iv) review the management of financial matters and focus on the independence and objectivity of \nthe external advisers, and the freedom allowed to the internal audit department. XHC will form an \ninternal audit unit with at least one staff member who is a certified accountant with accounting and \nauditing  experience.  The  internal  audit  unit  will  directly  report  to  AC.  The  board  of  directors will \nendorse the roles and responsibilities of internal auditors.  \n \n\n5. \n\nJob Descriptions and Budgeting \n\n \n5. \nAt present there is no written job description for XHC staff. Prior to the commencement of \nthe  Project,  a  document  containing  the  various  job  descriptions  should  be  developed.  The  job \ndescriptions should clearly define the duties and responsibilities of personnel, lines of supervision, \nand  limits  of  authority  for  all  of  the  officers,  managers,  and  staff.  It  appears  that  the  budgeting \naspect  of  XHC  needs  to be strengthened substantially.  Existing  process of budget preparation is \nonly appropriate due to the limited activities of XHC; however, once the Project is implemented, a \nmore  sophisticated  procedure  should  be  developed.  Before  the  start  of  each  project  year,  XHC \nshould have individual budget highlighting total planned expenditure and other relevant cost activity \nplanned for the coming year. These individual budgets should then be consolidated to produce the \ncorporate budget.  \n \n\n6. \n\nTraining of Personnel for Capacity Building \n\n \n6. \nIt is vital that personnel of the internal audit unit and finance department are trained on the \ndifferent ADB procedures and requirements to ensure smooth project implementation. In addition a \ntraining  program  should  also  be  developed  in  areas  identified  as  lacking.  These  areas  include \nproject budgeting, costing, department budgeting, financial analysis, internal control, and auditing.  \n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\n \n1. \nProject construction will have minor and very localized impacts on two villages in Xishui \ntownship. The population of Xishui township is only 1,151 despite a large administrative area of \n894 square kilometers. Farmland is very limited so people earn their livelihood as herders. The \nProject will permanently occupy 28 hectares (ha) of land, most of which is wasteland and about \n10  ha  is  grassland.  Only  two  households  (17 persons)  will  be  affected  by  permanent loss of \ngrassland  rights,  animal  sheds,  or  trees,  for  which  compensation  has  already  been  paid.  The \nProject  will  also  temporarily  occupy  26.7  ha  (mostly  wasteland  and  some  grassland)  for \nconstruction camps, borrow areas, spoil areas, and temporary work areas. Four households (12 \npersons) will be compensated for temporary losses. In total, only 100 square meters of animal \nsheds will be affected; no residential structures need to be relocated. Since the Project is a run-\nof-river  hydropower  plant,  components  that  affect  people  are  the  powerhouse  site  and  the \nwidening of the existing road to the powerhouse.  \n \n2. \nA  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  been  prepared  by  the  Xiaogushan  Hydropower \nCompany  (XHC)  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  The  RP  is  based  on  the  preliminary  design \nstudy  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households. \nConsultation  meetings  including  XHC,  local  officials,  and  affected  village  leaders  were  held  in \nFebruary  2002  to  establish  the  principles  and  compensation  standards  for  grassland  and  to \naddress  other  issues.  A  formal  grassland  acquisition  compensation  agreement  was  signed  in \nMarch 2002 between XHC and Xishui township. \n \n3. \nThe  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure  attainment  of  equal  or  better  livelihoods  and \nliving  standards  in  line  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Land  Administration  Law \n(1998),  the  PRC  Grassland  Law  (1985),  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  RP  compensation  standards  are  based  on  the  Land \nAdministration  Regulation  for  Gansu  province  and  the  Grassland  Management  Regulations  of \nSunan  county.  XHC  will  ensure  that  any  people  losing  land,  structures,  other  assets,  or  other \nmeans of production will be assisted in restoring their incomes and living standards to at least \nthe levels without the Project\u2019s intervention. Lost assets will either be replaced or their owners \ncompensated at replacement cost.  The  standard  for  grassland  compensation  is  10  times  the \nannual  average  output  value  of  the  land  over  the  past  3  years.  Information  on  compensation \nstandards and rates have been posted in the village and township offices.  The compensation is \npaid directly to the affected households. CNY7,500 was provided to each household for the loss \nof  simple  animal  sheds.  The  total  resettlement  budget  is  estimated  at  $25,000  equivalent \n(CNY0.2 million). \n \n4. \nXHC  has  agreed  to  implement  additional  measures  to  benefit  the  local  communities, \nincluding:  (i)  hiring  and  training  of  local  workers for project construction, (ii) provision of water \nsupply  for  Bajiaowan  village,  (iii)  allowing  access  to  project  facilities  (e.g.,  medical  emergency \nfacilities,  transportation,  electricity  supply),  (iv)  supporting  purchases  of  local  supplies  and \nservices for the local communities, (v) utilizing local work teams for the upgrading of the existing \nroad,  and  (vi) provision  of  more  reliable  electricity  supply  to  three  local  townships  after  project \ncompletion.  XHC  will  be  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  and  quarterly  reporting.  XHC  will \nensure  compliance  with  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  RP.  The  Sunan  County  Land  and \nResources  Bureau  will  conduct  regular  audits  of  compensation  payments  and  procedures. \nAnnual  audits  will  be  made  available  to  ADB.  XHC  will  also  engage  an  independent  monitor \n(e.g.,  a  local  sociologist)  to  investigate  resettlement  implementation  progress  and  community \ndevelopment issues, and prepare evaluation reports for submission to XHC and ADB every 12 \nmonths  over  the  4-year  project  period  to  assess  whether  affected  households  have  fully \nrestored their incomes and livelihoods, in accordance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n47\n\nLEAST-COST GENERATION PLANNING AND ANALYSIS \n\nLoad Forecast \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nEnergy demand forecasts play a key role in generation planning since the level of future \ndemand is one of the critical variables in selecting the least-cost power plant. The load forecast \nperiod for the Gansu network was divided into two terms: short-term (3 years) and long-term (to \nthe end of the system planning period in 2020). \n  \n2. \nShort-Term  Forecast.  A  bottom-up approach or  sector analysis method  was used for \nthe short-term forecast. Different end-use demands\u2014primary (agriculture), secondary (industry \nand  construction),  tertiary  (including  commercial  and  service),  and  residential  (urban  and \nrural)\u2014were  calculated  based  on  current  economic  activities,  policies, and  impact of  recent \nmajor construction projects in Gansu province.  \n \n3. \nLong-Term  Forecast.  Three  methods\u2014regression,  linear  time  series,  and exponential \ntime  series\u2014were  used  for  forecasting  energy  consumption.  The  regression  model  used \nelectricity tariff, gross domestic product, population, industry structure, and energy efficiency as \nindependent  variables.  The  historical  data  from  1986  to  2001  and  the  short-term  demand \ninformation  (2002\u20132004)  were  all  taken  as  inputs  to  the  regression  model.  The  results  are \nsummarized  in  Table  A13.1.  The  estimates  of  the  exponential  time  series  and  regression \nmodels  were  similar,  whereas  the  linear  time  series  produced  a  different  trend.  The  analysis \nused the estimate from the regression model and rejected the results from the linear time series.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Energy Forecast in Gansu Province  \n(gigawatt-hours) \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n\nRegression \n40,034 \n42,198 \n44,598 \n47,256 \n50,198 \n53,451 \n56,277 \n59,351 \n62,694 \n66,330 \n70,285 \n73,680 \n77,311 \n81,194 \n85,347 \n89,788 \n\nLinear \n36,530 \n37,780 \n39,040 \n40,290 \n41,540 \n42,800 \n44,050 \n45,300 \n46,560 \n47,810 \n49,060 \n50,320 \n51,570 \n52,830 \n54,080 \n55,330 \n\nExponent \n39,653 \n41,883 \n44,238 \n46,725 \n49,353 \n52,128 \n55,059 \n58,155 \n61,424 \n64,878 \n68,526 \n72,379 \n76,449 \n80,748 \n85,288 \n90,083 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Gansu Provincial Government; Staff estimates . \n\n \n \nAnalysis of Power Balance. Electricity demand in the northwest network is expected to \n4. \ngrow  at  7%  and  6.4%  in  the  10th  and  11th  Five-Year  planning  periods  (2001\u20132005  and  2006\u2013\n2010), respectively. Similarly, energy demand growth in Gansu province is expected to be 6.0% \nand  5.7% for the same period.  The  Xiliushi  and  Xiaogushan  hydropower  stations  are  the  two \nproposed hydropower plants on Heihe river expected to start producing power around 2005 to \n2007.

Five \n\n \n \n \n5. \nThe  Zhangye  City  network  has  two  comparable  but  distinct  peak  demand  scenarios, \nwinter and summer. The summer peak imposes maximum demand on the existing network. The \nsummer demand is made up of a larger peak mainly due to agricultural (pumped irrigation) load. \nThe  Xiaogushan Hydropower  Plant  (XHP)  will  provide  maximum  generation  during  summer \nmonths and is particularly suited to alleviate the peak electricity demand gaps in summer for the \nZhangye City network. \n \nB. \n \nBecause  of  the  large  gap  between  demand  (1,400\u20132,000  gigawatt-hours  [GWh]) and \n6. \nsupply (750\u20131,200 GWh) in  Zhangye City, demand-side responses were not considered as full \nalternatives  in  the  analysis.  Only  supply-side  options\u2014new  generation  plants\u2014were used as \nviable options. \n \n7. \nthree  power  generation \ntechnologies\u2014hydropower,  coal-fired,  and  natural-gas-fired\u2014were  preliminarily  considered  for \nselecting viable electricity generation for the  province. Three fossil-fuel generation technologies \nwere considered as technology alternatives: coal-fired thermal (small, 300 megawatts [MW] and \nlarge, 600  MW),  and  combined-cycle  gas  turbine  (CCGT,  300  MW).  Technology  alternatives, \nincluding XHP, were analyzed in detail. Capital and annual operation and maintenance costs for \neach  technology  alternative  were  examined.  The  capital  cost  used  in  the  analysis  excluded \nphysical  contingency  and  taxes.  The  hydropower  and  coal-fired  power  stations  were  the  only \ntwo  options  that  showed  a  positive  net  present  value  (using  a  12%  discount  rate).  The  larger \nhydropower  options  were  not  considered  in  detail  due  to  project  schedule  and  hydrological \nrestrictions; the CCGT option was dropped due to the lack of natural gas reserves in the project \narea. \n \n8. \nFor  direct  comparability  the  output  of  each  alternative  was  normalized.  Adjustments \nwere  also  made  for  load  factor  differences.  It  was  assumed  that  aside  from  the  benefit  for \ncapacity  substitution  for  XHP,  the  alternatives  would  generate  more  energy  (load  factor  is \naround 68%) to substitute generation from small  coal-fired plants. The latter could not be used \nto  meet  incremental  demand,  but  would  save  fuel  consumption  in  existing  plants,  bringing \nenergy saving benefits.  \n\ninitial  alternatives  using \n\n \n9. \nThe  equalizing  discount  rate\u2014the  discount  at  which  the  present  value  of  two  life-cycle \ncost  streams  are  equal,  thus  indicating  a  discount  rate  at  which  preference  changes\u2014shows \nthat  hydropower  remains  a  better  alternative  up  to  the  discount  rate  of  12.85%,  after  which \nsmaller  thermal  power  will  be  preferable.  Hydropower,  with  its  high  capital  costs  and  very  low \noperational cost, is the preferred option when lower discount rates are used.  \n \n10. \nUsing viable technological options\u2014hydropower and coal-fired plants\u2014a list of feasible \npower plant alternatives was developed subject to the constraints imposed by the environment, \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49\n\nriver flow, and geography.  Various small and medium size hydropower options were considered \n(including few-megawatt small hydropower stations up to large stations such as the 1,400 MW \nHeishanxia station). The development sequence for these hydropower candidates before 2010 \nhas  been  designated  as  fixed  schemes  due  to  their  being either under construction or  there \nhaving been other development purposes (e.g., flood control and water supply). The XHP is the \nonly candidate for power expansion in the period up to 2010 and others except fixed ones will be \navailable after 2010 (Table A13.3).  \n \n\nTable A13.3: Identified Feasible Alternatives to Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant \n \n\nLiujiaxia Expansiona \n\n300MW Thermal \n600MW Thermal \n\nCoal-Fired Thermal \n  Pingliang Planta \n \n \nHydropower \n \n  Xiaoxiaa \nJiudianxiaa \n \n  Heishanxiaa \n  Xiliushuia \n  New Wind Farm  and Small Hydropowera \nXHP \n  Qilinsi \n  Other L&M H ydropower \nL&M = large and medium sized, MW = megawatt, XHP = Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant. \na  Small Hydropower includes  XHP (98 MW).  \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \n\nCapacity, MW \n600 \n300 \n600 \n \n300 \n230 \n240 \n1,400 \n157 \n162 \n98 \n113 \n1,000 \n\nCommitted Period \n2003\u20132004 \n2004\u20132011 \n2012\u20132020 \n \n2006\u20132007 \n2005\u20132006 \n2008\u20132009 \n2010\u20132013 \n2005\u20132006 \n2002\u20132005 \n2006\u20132007 \n2020 \n2016\u20132020 \n\n11. \nIdentifying  the  Least-cost  Option.  The  Generation  Expansion  System  Planning \n(GESP) II  model was used to identify the least-cost alternative generation option from the list of \nfeasible alternatives based on the demand forecast for the Gansu power system. The least-cost \nanalyses confirmed the robustness of XHC. The GESP II model optimized (minimized cost) the \nobjective function total system cost to meet power demand within the defined reliability criteria. \nThe planning period used was 2002 to 2020 and in order to reflect the operation characteristics \nof expansion candidates sufficiently, the study period was expanded to 2050. The technical and \neconomic  indices  of  the  power  system  from  2021  to  2050  were  assumed  to  be  the  same  as \nthose in 2020. \n \n12. \nThe optimization model simulated power exchange between Gansu and other provinces \nas  additional  power  plants  (power  import)  or  load  demand  (power  export).  Three  hydrologic \nconditions  were  considered:  average  with  80%  probability,  wet  with  10%  probability,  and  dry \nwith  10%  probability.  The  production  simulation was carried out for all hydrological conditions. \nThe least-cost analysis used the weighted average operations cost based on the probabilities in \nthe objective function. The forecast annual load curve was modeled using three seasons: wet \nseason (April to September), average season (October to  December), and dry season (January \nto  March).  Based  on  the  historic  data,  the  system  peak  was  modeled  in  the  dry  season.  The \nfixed  system  included  existing  power  plants,  under  construction  or  decided  generation  plants, \nretirement  plan  of  generation  units,  and  power  exchanges  with  other  power  grids.  The GESP \nmodel identified the 98 MW XHP as the least-cost alternative for generation expansion in Gansu \nprovince.  \n \nC. \n \nThe major conclusions of the least-cost analysis are: (i) gas-fired combined cycle is not \n13. \nviable,  small  hydropower  and  small  to  medium  coal-fired  power  stations  are  technologically \nviable  alternatives  for  generation  in  Gansu;  and  (ii)  the  98  MW  XHC  was  the  least-cost \nalternative for generation expansion.  \n\nConclusions \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nA. \n\nEstimation of Benefits \n\nEstimation of Costs \n \n1. \nEconomic  costs  are  at  2003  prices  and  are  expressed  in  domestic  currency.  Tradable \ncommodities  were  valued  at  border  prices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate.  Nontradable \ncommodities were valued through  shadow prices using a standard conversion factor of 0.93, and \nspecific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.67 for steel, 0.76 for cement, 0.82 for timber, 2.0 \nfor  skilled  labor,  and  0.67  for  unskilled  labor.  The  capital  costs  were  also  adjusted  to  eliminate \nprice inflation, interest during construction, and taxes. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  main  benefit  of  the  Project  is  power  generation  to  meet  the  electricity  demand  in \nZhangye  City.  Analysis  used  conservative  estimates  of  the  actual  benefits\u2014lower forecast for \ngeneration, plant use of 1%, and transmission losses of 3%, formed the basis for the incremental \nnet  energy  supply  from  the  Xiaogushan Hydropower  Plant  (XHP).  XHP,  with  its  98-megawatt \n(MW) installed capacity, is assumed to generate about 366 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year, which \nrepresents about 43% load factor or an average load of 42 MW. The quantification of incremental \nbenefits was based on end-users\u2019 willingness-to-pay (WTP). \n \n3. \nEconomic benefit was calculated using a linear and a semilog electricity demand function. \nThe estimate using a semilog demand function was lower than the linear method, which assumes \nthat 50% of the price difference represents consumer surplus. Consumer surplus\u2014the difference \nbetween  what  one  is  willing  to  pay  for  a  commodity  and  the  amount  one  is  actually  required  to \npay\u2014was estimated  as  CNY0.63/kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  using  a  semilog  function.1 The WTP for \nthe Project was calculated by deducting the incremental cost of distribution and transmission. A \nbenchmark figure of CNY0.16/kWh was used as an estimate for the incremental transmission and \ndistribution cost. The final result of CNY0.47/kWh was used for all economic benefit calculations.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe basis for project evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs between the with-\nproject  (base)  case  and  the  without-project (alternative) case. The project analysis period is 24 \nyears  following  expected  full  operation  by  2008.  The  project  construction  period  is  4  years \ncommencing  in  2004  to  the  end  of  2007.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was \ncalculated at 23.4%, indicating that XHC is economically viable (Table A14.1).  \n \n5. \nA complete quantification and estimation of all benefits from the Project was not possible \ndue  to  various  factors  including  time  and  resources.  Thus,  the  total  benefits  estimated  in  this \nanalysis  can  be  interpreted  as  conservative  estimates.  There  are  large  positive  environmental \nbenefits from the avoided pollution from an alternative energy source (a coal-fired thermal power \nplant).  Among  these  environmental  benefits,  the  most  prominent  ones  are:  improved  human \nhealth from avoided morbidity and mortality from fine particulates, improved human welfare due \nto  improved  visibility  and  reduced  materials  damage  from  avoided  air  pollution,  and  positive \nimpacts  on  environmental  resources  due  to  avoided  emission  of  carbon  dioxide.  The  analysis \nalso  excludes  quantification  of  economic  costs  and  benefits  from  the  rural  electrification,  and \ninstitutional strengthening components. \n \n\nEstimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n                                                 \n1  ERD Technical Note 3, p. 8.

The  analysis  reflects the \nfact that incentives for XHC are sufficient, and funds are adequate for continuing operation. The \nquantification of costs and benefits shows that overall economic benefits outweigh costs.  Crucial \nin the quantification of benefits was estimating incremental energy supply and consumers\u2019 WTP \nfor  those  benefits.  Consumer  surplus  was  calculated  based  on  a  linear  electricity  demand \nfunction.  This  method  assumes  50%  of  the  price  difference  represents  consumer  surplus.  The \nestimated  consumer  surplus  was  CNY0.63/kWh  using  a  semilog  function.  The  WTP  for  the \nProject  was  calculated  by  deducting  the  incremental  cost  of  distribution  and  transmission  of \nCNY0.16/kWh  from  CNY0.63/kWh.  The  final  result  of  CNY0.47/kWh  was  used  as  the  WTP \nthroughout the document.  \n \n9. \nBased on the economic analysis, it was estimated that the Project\u2019s net present value is \nCNY392  million.  The  quantification  was  based  on  the  WTP2  and  a  gross  energy  generation  of \n366 GWh less annualized capital and maintenance costs. The analysis yields a base case EIRR \nof 23.4%. Sensitivity and risk analysis shows that the EIRR is robust. An economic evaluation of \nlocal  environmental  impacts  was  also  undertaken  and  it  improved  the  EIRR  to  24.8%.  The \nanalysis  concludes  that  XHC  is  not  only  the  least-cost  alternative  but  is  also  justifiable  in \neconomic terms. \n                                                 \n2 \n\nIn real, 2003 terms. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n53\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n \nA. \n \nXiaogushan  Hydropower  Company  (XHC)  was  established  in  December  2001  and  it  is \n1. \nfully  responsible  for  implementing  the  Xiaogushan  Hydropower  Plant  (XHP)  component  of  the \nProject. Financial analysis evaluates the commercial viability of XHP and is focused primarily on \nXHC  as  the  implementing  agency  (IA).  Detailed  financial  analysis  is  found  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  K.  Prices  in  dollar  terms  are  assumed  to  increase  in  accordance  with  international \ninflation  forecasts  of  2.0%  per  year;  and  prices  in  local  currency  are  expected  to  increase  by \n1.5% in 2003 and 2004, and  by  2.5%  from  2005.  Exchange  rates  were  used  to  convert  the \nfuture  CNY/kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  tariff  in  equivalent  $/kWh  terms  and  the  rates  reflect  the \ndifferential inflation between foreign and local currency. \n \nB. \n \nThe estimated costs for the XHP component, including physical and price contingencies \n2. \nand  capitalized  financial  charges  during  development  are  $87  million.  The  Government  has \nrequested  a  loan  of  $35  million  (40.2%  of  the  total  project  cost)  from  the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the balance will be financed by loan from Bank of China and equity capital. For \nthe ADB loan a long-term interest rate of 4.5%\u2014although the current London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)  rates  are  lower\u2014is  used  for  the  analysis.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end fee of \n0.5%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements. \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to XHC through the Gansu Provincial \nGovernment and Zhangye City Government in the same currency and on the same terms and \nconditions  as  the  ADB  loan  to  the  Government.  The  equity  holders  for  XHC\u2014Hei  He \nHydropower  Development  Company,  Zhangye  Water  and  Power  Bureau,  and  Gansu Yinlong \nConstruction Company\u2014will finance about $14 million equivalent in local currency cost. Bank of \nChina will cofinance $38 million. Analysis assumes long-term interest of 5.76% over a 15-year \nterm for the Bank of China loans.

A \nreasonable efficient level of cost structure and fair return on investment can only be used as a \nproxy to assess the longer term competitive market price for electricity. \n \n4. \nUsing a revenue requirement approach, the hydropower generation tariff was calculated \nas CNY0.26/kWh.1 About 1.2% risk premium was added to the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) to reflect a more realistic financial opportunity cost of capital. The reasonable level of \nrevenue requirement for XHC, in a typical year, is calculated using: a return on asset of 5.73%, \ndepreciation  of  3.75%,  no  new  investment  or  capital  expenditure,  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenses  of  about  CNY12.4  million,  and  an  average  tax  level  of  CNY10.7  million.  A  tariff of \nCNY0.26/kWh  is  the  minimum  threshold  required  to  recover  the  opportunity  cost  of  CNY91.4 \nmillion  per  year  from  sales  of  351  GWh  of  electricity  to  be  sold  by  XHC.  In  light  of  these \ncalculations,  the  proposed  tariff  of  CNY0.29/kWh  by  the  Executing  Agency is considered high \nand on a conservative note, a long-term tariff of CNY0.26/kWh is used in the analysis.  \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe  net  cash  flows  during  the  lifetime  of  the  Project  are  discounted  at  the  financial \nopportunity cost of capital to show a project\u2019s worth in financial terms. The WACC is used as a \nproxy  for  the  financial  opportunity  cost  of  the  Project,  which  is  generally  used  to  evaluate  the \nfinancial  viability  of  ADB  projects.  The  WACC  represents  a  weighted  average  of  the  different \nreturns (interests) paid to the various source of funds for the Project. The calculation of WACC \nis  based  on  the  financing  plans  shown  in  Table  A15.2  and  it  applies  only  to  the  Project.  After \nadjustment  for  the  corporate  rate  of  33%  for  tax  deductibility  of  interest  payments,  and for the \nlocal inflation projection of 2.5%, the post-tax real WACC is calculated as 4.53%. \n \n6. \nADB  guidelines  on  financial  management  require  that  the  real  cost  of  capital  for  each \ncomponent should be at least 4% and where a financing component fails the minimum rate test, \nthe derived value should be replaced with 4%. For example, the domestic loan component with \n5.76%  interest\u2014became  1.32%  after  adjusted  for  tax  at  33%\u2014fails the minimum rate test of \n4%. The derived value was replaced with 4%. The WACC would be 2.98% without the minimum \nrate test.  \n \nE. \n \nFinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  measures  the  viability  of  a  project.  Table  A15.2 \n7. \npresents  the  XHP\u2019s  component\u2019s  receipts,  payments,  and  net  cash  flows  for  the  full  project \nperiod  (24  years)  where  it  is  assumed  that  the  receipts  and  payments  will  remain  constant  in \nreal terms once a steady state is reached. The present value of net benefits becomes zero at a \ndiscount  rate  of  7.5%,  which  is  the  FIRR  for  the  Project.  Since  the  cash  flows  in  the  FIRR \ncalculation are post-tax, the FIRR is compared against the post-tax WACC of 4.53%. Since the \nFIRR is higher than WACC, the XHC component is financially viable. Sensitivity analysis shows \nthat subjected to adverse conditions, the FIRR remains robust (Table A15.3). \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  A discussion of electricity tariffs and tariff reforms is found in Appendix 16. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n55\n\nTable A15.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return for XHC \n(CNY million) \n\n \nItem \nReceipts \nGross Energy Generation (GWh) \nNet Energy Generation (GWh) \n\nTariff (CNY/kWh) \nTotal Receipts a \nPayments \nProject Cost \nOperation and Maintenance Cost \nTotal Payments  \nTax \nNet Cash Flow after Tax \n\n2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2015 \n \n348 \n334 \n\n \n366 \n351 \n\n \n366 \n351 \n\n \n366 \n351 \n\n \n366 \n351 \n\n \n90 \n86 \n\n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n2020  2028 \n \n330 \n316 \n\n \n348 \n334 \n\n0.26 \n \n \n\n0.26 \n \n \n\n0.26 \n22.2 \n \n95.4  254.3  222.5 \n8.2 \n\u2014 \n95.4  254.3  230.7 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n(95.4)  (254.3)  (208.5) \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n0.26 \n90.1 \n \n63.6 \n10.4 \n74.0 \n\u2014 \n16.1 \n\n0.26 \n90.1 \n \n\u2014 \n11.0 \n11.0 \n4.6 \n74.5 \n\n0.25 \n85.6 \n \n\u2014 \n12.4 \n12.4 \n4.0 \n69.2 \n\n0.25 \n85.6 \n \n\u2014 \n12.4 \n12.4 \n4.3 \n68.9 \n\n0.25 \n81.4 \n \n\u2014 \n12.4 \n12.4 \n10.7 \n58.2 \n\n0.23 \n77.1 \n \n\u2014 \n12.4 \n12.4 \n12.8 \n51.9 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIRR = 7.5% \n\n \n\n0.23 \n73.0 \n \n\u2014 \n12.4 \n12.4 \n13.6 \n47.0 \n\n \n\n \nCNY = yuan, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, \u2014 = not available.  \na  Net of city maintenance and education-added taxes. \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A15.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\nCapital Cost Overrun \nEnergy Sales Reduction \nImplementation  Delay \n\nSensitivity Analysis of FIRR \n \nBase Case \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv)  Combination of (i) and (ii) \n(v)  Combination of (i) and (iii) \n(vi)  Tariff  Reduction \n(vii)  CNY (Exchange Rate) Depreciation \nCNY = yuan, FIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Staff estimates. \n\nChange in Variable \n \n \n10% \n(10%) \n1 year \n \n \n(10%) \n10% \n\nFIRR (%) \n \n7.5 \n6.3 \n5.7 \n6.0 \n4.6 \n5.0 \n5.7 \n6.9 \n\n \n\n\f \n56\n\nAppendix 16 \n\nELECTRICITY TARIFF AND TARIFF ANALYSIS \n \n\nSubsidies in Electricity Tariff  \n\nRegulatory Reform and Tariff  \n\nA. \n \n1. \nCurrently the Gansu Provincial Price Bureau (GPPB) is the tariff approval authority for all \npower  generating  plants  in  Gansu  Province.  This  bureau  administratively  reports  to  the \nprovincial  government  and  follows  the  guidelines  from  the  State  Price  Bureau.  The  GPPB \napproves the tariff based on actual costs at the final stage of a project, before actual generation. \nBased on estimated cost figures, it gives agreements (in  principle) on the estimated tariff at the \nfeasibility  stage.  The  current  mode  of  tariff  approval  will  be  changed  with  the  introduction  of \ncompetition, and changes have already been initiated at the national level. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nGPPB  intends  to  establish  cost  reflective  tariffs  in  most  cases,  and  tariffs  for  both \ngenerator and end-user reflects that intention. However, cross subsidies exist between end-user \ncategories,  e.g.,  commercial  consumers  subsidize  agricultural  consumers.  Average  tariffs  in \nGansu are shown in Table A16.1. Tariffs have increased over the 1993\u20132000 period. Agricultural \ntariffs had the lowest increase compared to all other end-user categories. In 1997, 1998, and 1999 \nthe  Gansu  Province  average  electricity  tariffs  of  CNY0.249  kilowatt  per  hour  (kWh),  0.260, and \n0.262  were  lower  than  the  national  average  electricity  tariff  of  0.341,  0.353,  and  0.356.1 Gansu \nprovince  electricity  tariffs  are  also  generally  lower  than  the  North-West Power Network average \nelectricity  tariff.  The  average  tariff  in  Zhangye  City  in  2001  was  0.216/kWh  (A  detailed  tariff \nanalysis is given in Supplementary Appendix M).  \n\n3. \nIt is important to note that the price for generation by Xiaogushan Hydropower Company \n(XHC)\u2014CNY0.26/kWh\u2014is  higher  than  the  overall  average  tariff  in  the  Zhangye  City.  It  is  only \npossible because the cost of generation from other old generators in the Province is significantly \nlower, making the weighted average cost of generation much lower.  CNY0.26/kWh is the least-\ncost option for new generation in the Province. This indicates, that in the medium to longer term, \nwith retirement of older plants and addition of newer plants, the prices in Zhangye City will be \nincreased unless it receives direct subsidy from the province. Rural tariffs are generally higher \nthan  average  tariffs  due  to  their  distances  from  the  distribution  substations.  The  power \ndistribution  company  decides  the  tariff  in  a  particular  rural  township  by  adding  the  cost  of \nserving these consumers and the purchase price of electricity from the network. \n\n \n\nTown* \nAnyang \nHuazhai \nXidong \nGanjun \nLongqu \nXishui \n\nTable A16.1: Tariffs in Rural Town \n(CNY/kWh) \n \n\nCommercial \n0.84 \n0.57 \n0.84 \n0.84 \n0.84 \nnone \n\nIndustry \n0.53 \n0.69 \n0.62 \n0.62 \nnone \nnone \n\nResidence  \n0.538 \n0.530 \n0.530 \n0.530 \n0.750 \n0.980 \n\nAgriculture/Irrigation \n0.538 \n0.530 \n0.270 \n0.270 \n0.750 \nNo pump irrigation \n\nCNY = yuan, kWh kilowatt-hour. \n* Selected towns only. \nSource: Staff estimates  \n\n                                                 \n1  Based on statistics from  the  State  Power  Company    (Electric  Power  Industry  in  China  Yearbooks of 1999 and \n  2000). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n57\n\nBuilding Block Approach for Tariff Calculation  \n\nC. \n \n4. \nA common method used by regulators to assess tariffs of monopoly assets is known as \nthe  building  block  method.  This  involves  the  addition  of  the  various  costs  of  a  business  to \ncalculate  revenue  required  for  a  business  to  be  viable,  and  division  by  forecast  quantities  to \ncalculate  tariffs.  The  key  components  of  the  building  blocks  approach  are:  return  on  assets; \ndepreciation;  operation  and  maintenance  expenses;  and  taxation\u2014when  post-tax  Weighted \nAverage Cost of Capital (WACC) is used for Return on Assets. \n \nReturn  on  Assets.  It  is  the  total  return  required  for  the  asset  to  meet  the  investor\u2019s \n5. \nopportunity cost, usually measured as the asset value times the cost of capital. Cost of capital is \ncalculated  by  adding  the  cost  of  debt  and  cost  of equity with the respective weights or use of \nWACC. \n \n6. \nReturn  of  Assets.  It  is  the  proportion  of  assets  used  for  production  of  goods  and \nservices in the year, or depreciation. It is calculated by dividing historical asset value by the life \nof an asset. For XHC, a depreciation rate of 3.75%. \n \n7. \nOperation  and  Maintenance  Cost.  A  benchmark  figure  of  CNY0.03/kWh  (excluding \ndepreciation) was used, which is consistent to similar projects. Considering the remoteness of \nthe project area, adjustments were made in certain components of the operation costs.  \n\nProposed Tariffs for Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant \n\n \n8. \nTaxation.  Analysis  used  a  post-tax  WACC  for  return  on  assets.  No  allowances  were \nmade  for  tax  in  the  calculation,  so  it  is  added  separately  in  the  building  block  approach  to \ncalculate revenue requirement. \n \nD. \n \nAt  the  feasibility  stage  projects  are  screened  on  the  basis  of  cost  estimates  and  the \n9. \nacceptable  unit  price  range  is  CNY  7,000\u201310,000  per  kilowatt  (kW).  Xiaogushan Hydropower \nPlant  with  about  8,200  CNY/kW  project  cost,  and  CNY0.26/kWh  proposed  tariff,  is  consistent \nwith recently approved tariffs of similar types of power projects in the region. The proposed tariff \nof CNY0.26/kWh is in 2003 prices. It is assumed that the generation tariff will be reduced by 5% \n(real terms) in 2009 and by 10% from 2019 onwards. This gradual reduction in price and volume \nis  used  to  model  the  risk  resulting  from  likely  competition  from  other  generators  once \ncompetition is introduced and the energy sector is deregulated.  \n\n\f \n\n58\n\nAppendix 17 \n\nSOCIAL AND POVERTY ANALYSIS \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nPoverty Profile of Project Area. Of Zhangye City\u2019s 1.25 million population, almost 80% \nare  classified  as  rural.  Of  its  rural  population,  293,000  or  almost  30%  have  incomes  less than \nthe  national  rural  poverty  line  of  CNY1,100.  Using  the  lower  range  of  provincial  estimates  it  is \nestimated  that  17,000  can  be  classified  as  poor.  Details  of  poverty  incidence  in  Zhangye  City \ncan be found in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n \n2. \nCauses of Poverty. In the farming areas of  Zhangye City, the main causes of poverty \nare related to low farm productivity, lack of supplemental income sources, and lack of education. \nThis  is  aside  from  the  harsh  natural  conditions,  which  includes  high altitude  that  limits the \ngrowing season to 80\u2013170 frost-free days allowing only one field crop per year; poor soils and \nlow  rainfall;  and  inadequate  irrigation.  Many  farmers  have  unreliable  gravity  irrigation  and \ncannot  use  electricity  to  pump  water  from  either  an  irrigation  canal  or  from  an  aquifer  of \neconomic  depth  resulting  in  lower  and  less  stable  yields.  Herder  communities  face  similar \nissues of low productivity, lack of supplemental income sources, and lack of education.  \n \n3. \nRural Electricity Services and Household Consumption. Rural areas in Zhangye City \nface  regular  load  shedding.  During  power  shortages,  remote  rural  areas,  which  are  generally \nserviced through 10-kilovolt distribution lines, are cut off first. Xishui township, where the project \nis  located,  had  power  outages  for  70  days  in  2001  due  to  load  shedding.  The  power  outages \ngenerally  last  one  or  two  days.  Outages  result  in  electricity  being  unavailable  during  critical \nperiods  of  the  growing  season,  according  to  farmers.  Low  voltages  prevent  the  usage  of \nsensitive  appliances,  motors,  and  equipment  (e.g.,  x-ray machines in clinics) or may damage \nequipment due to voltage fluctuations. Extra cost is required for voltage stabilizers. The average \nelectricity consumption of poor households is generally very low. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nEthnic Minorities There are 32 ethnic minorities in Zhangye City accounting for 2.1% of \nZhangye\u2019s  total  population.  The  largest  groups  are  Yugur  (37.1%),  Zang/Tibetan  (36.6%),  and \nHui (15.9%), with the rest of the minorities constituting less than 10% of the total. Three-fourths \nof  ethnic  minorities in  Zhangye  City  are  in  Sunan,  the  only  Yugur  autonomous  county  in  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  The  nationalities  directly  affected  by  the  project  are  the  Zang  in \nMati district and the Yugur in neighboring districts, all located in Sunan county. The Xiaogushan \nHydropower  Plant  construction  will  have  very  localized  impacts  on  two  villages  in  Xishui.  The \nlocal  community  will  benefit  economically  from  its  proximity  to  the  construction  activities  and \nlater  powerhouse  operation.  The  Xishui  township  government  is  formulating  a  community \ndevelopment strategy and plans1 to ensure that the economic benefits from the Project can be \nproperly managed in a manner to strengthen the local communities in harmony with traditional \nvalues  and  customs.  The  strategy  and  plan  was  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  with  the \naffected villagers. \n \nResettlement.  A  short  resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared  by  the  Xiaogushan \n5. \nHydropower Company (XHC), a summary of which is found in Appendix 12. The RP is based on \nthe preliminary design study and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected \nhouseholds. A formal grassland acquisition compensation agreement was signed in March 2001 \nbetween XHC and Xishui township. Two households affected by the Project have already been \n\nSocial Issues \n\n                                                 \n1  The draft community development strategy and plan was submitted to ADB on 1 April 2003. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n59\n\ncompensated for the loss of grassland acquired for the preparatory works on the Project. XHC \nhas finalized the short RP based on consultation with Xishui township and affected villages.2  \n \n6. \nAffordability. Electricity is an expensive commodity for the poor. In the project area, the \ntypical consumption of electricity for rural households ranges from 10 kilowatt-hours (kWh) to 26 \nkWh per month, mostly used for lighting. Such consumption rates would cost CNY50\u2013300 per \nyear, which represents 2\u201310% of the household\u2019s net income. Use of electricity for groundwater \nirrigation is growing. However, the groundwater is deep (150 to 400 meters) and thus expensive \nto pump, especially with low  agricultural prices. Consequently, there has been political pressure \nto subsidize electricity prices for farmers, and irrigation in particular. Even at subsidized tariffs, \naffordability is a serious issue for the farmers in general, and poor households in particular. \n \n7. \nCommunity  Enhancement  Measures.  XHC  is  considering  implementing  additional \nmeasures to benefit local communities, including: (i) hiring and training  local workers for project \nconstruction, (ii) provision of water supply for Baojiawan village, (iii) allowing access to project \nfacilities  (e.g.,  medical  emergency  facilities,  transportation,  electricity  supply),  (iv)  supporting \npurchases of local supplies and services for the local communities, (v) utilizing local work teams \nfor  the  upgrading  of  the  existing  road,  and  (vi)  provision  of  more reliable  electricity supply to \nthree local townships after project completion. These would all result in positive social benefits. \n \nC.  \n \n8. \nThe project will provide poverty reduction benefits through improved electricity supply for \nthe poor,  cleaner  energy,  and  employment  opportunities during project construction and after \ncompletion  due  to  increased  economic  development  in  the  project  area.  The  poverty  impact \nratio was calculated at 42% (Table A17). \n \n\nPoverty Reduction Benefits \n\nTable A17: Poverty Impact Ratio \n\nDifference  Consumers \n\nGovernment/ \nEconomy \n\n  \nLabor \n\n \n\nDistribution of \nProject Effects \nOutput (Revenues/Benefits) \nInvestment Cost \nOperating Cost \nTax \nTotal \n\nFinancial  Economic \nReturns \nReturns \n1,957  \n1,001 \n(532) \n(572) \n(142) \n(169) \n \n(102) \n1,283 \n158 \n\n        \n\n  \nBeneficiaries \n\nNEB-NFB \nFinancial Return \nBenefits  \nProportion to Poor \nBenefits to Poor \nPoverty Impact Ratio \nSource: Staff estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n956 \n40 \n26 \n102 \n1,125 \n\n956 \n \n956 \n48% \n457 \n \n\n  \n\n956 \n \n \n \n956 \n\n135 \n158 \n293 \n55% \n161 \n \n\n \n\nGovernment/ \n\nConsumers  Economy \n\n38 \n13 \n102 \n153 \n\n \nLabor \n34 \n \n34 \n43% \n14 \n \n\n2 \n13 \n \n15 \n\n \nTotal \n1,125 \n388 \n1,513 \n \n632 \n42% \n\n                                                 \n2  The final RP was submitted to ADB on 28 April 2003. \n\n\f \n\n60\n\nAppendix 17 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?  \n\nYes, PRC Poverty Partnership \nAgreement signed on 29 Sep \n2003. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Classification: Other \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in PRC: Yes, through improved electricity supply for the poor, \ncleaner energy,and employment opportunities during project construction and after completion due to increased \neconomic development in the Project area. \n \nB. \n \nThe  analysis  concludes  that  about  23%  of  total  beneficiaries  (1.25 million) are poor persons who will directly benefit \nfrom the Project.3 The poverty impact ratio (percent of project benefits that accrue to the poor) is estimated to be 42%. \nThe  Project  will  provide  new  economic  opportunities  for  the  poor  through  improved  electricity  supply,  increased \ngroundwater irrigation,  (e.g.,  for  lighting,  water  pumping  for  irrigation  and  domestic  uses,  and  agricultural  machinery), \nand employment in new enterprises that are attracted to Zhangye City. Also, the Project will create about  3,000 person-\nyears of job opportunities within the unskilled labor category. Total additional income for these poor unskilled laborers is \nestimated around CNY20 million during the 4-year construction phase. \n \n \nC. \nParticipation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \nParticipation during project preparation:  The Xiaogushan Hydropower Company (XHC) undertook public meetings with \nlocal  officials  and  village  leaders  which  raised  the  level  of  awareness,  gained  local  support,  and  enabled  affected \npeople  to  voice  opinions  and  suggestions  for  project  design  and  implementation.  The  participatory  approach  was \ninitiated  during  project  design  and  is  an  ongoing  activity  which  will  be  continued  during project implementation. The \npoor and women have been carefully considered in conducting participatory activities.  \n \nParticipation  strategy:  For  the  selection  of  unskilled  labor  in  the  project  area,  the  contractors  will  discuss  with  local \ntownship labor officials and local village leaders. XHC has proposed that Xishui township would organize labor teams \nfor the upgrading of the existing road, using supervision and equipment of XHC and other construction work. \n\nYes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPotential Issues \n\n \nD. \n \nSubject \n \nResettlement \n\nSignificant, Not Significant, \nUncertain, None \n \nNot Significant \n\n \nGender \n\n \nNot Significant \n\n \nAffordability \n\n \nNot Significant \n\n \nLabor \n\n \nIndigenous  \nPeople \n\n \nNot Significant \n\n \nNot Significant \n\n \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \n\n \nNone \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nShort resettlement plan (RP) prepared, \ndisclosure of RP, RP posted on websites, \nimplementation by Xishui township, auditing by \nZhangye Land and Resources Bureau. \n \nWomen will gain many Project benefits and \nwomen will receive priority for direct and \nindirect project-related employment (target is \n30% of unskilled labor). \n \nThe Project will help to keep the cost of \nelectricity low.
