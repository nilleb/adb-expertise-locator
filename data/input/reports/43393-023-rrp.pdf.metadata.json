The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe  project  will  prepare  (i)  a  detailed  design  and  detailed  design  appraisal, \n2. \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  documents,  and  bidding  and  contract  documents  for  the \nTan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section of the HCMC RR3 (28.4 kilometers [km]) and an extension road to \nNational  Highway  1  (5.9  km);  and  (ii)  detailed  feasibility  studies  and  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard documents, including social impact assessment, environmental impact assessment, \nand  resettlement  plans,  for  the  National  Highway  22\u2013Binh  Chuan  section  (17.5  km)  and  Ben \nLuc\u2013National Highway 22 section (29.2 km) of the HCMC RR3. Collectively these comprise the \nRR3  project  sections.  The  small-scale  project  preparatory  TA  study,1 completed  in  December \n2012, confirmed that the RR3 project sections in the first phase require a controlled-access four-\nlane toll expressway and free-access two-lane service roads on both sides of the expressway. \nThe estimated total investment cost for the three remaining sections of the RR3 is about $2.2 \nbillion. Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the provincial authorities plan to seek and mobilize this \namount  from  official  development  assistance,  counterpart  funding,  and  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestors during 2015\u20132020.2   \n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nHCMC is the largest city in Viet Nam, with a population in its greater urban area of over \n9  million,  which  is  expected  to  grow  to  13.8  million  by  2025.  The  metropolitan  area  is  the \nprimary  engine  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  development,  accounting  for  nearly  40%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  gross  domestic  product.  The  integrated  management  of  the  urban  expansion  of \nHCMC  and  its  adjoining  provinces  is  viewed  as  the  key  to  the  sustainable  growth  of  the  city-\nregion.  However,  due  to  rapid  traffic  growth  and  low  road  densities,  many  major  roads  and \nhighways in the project area have reached their capacity; the resulting severe traffic congestion \nand rising logistical costs pose serious constraints to HCMC\u2019s continued economic growth and \ncompetitiveness.  The  existing  RR2,  with  a  length  of  55  km,  is  no  longer  able  to  provide  the \nneeded  capacity.  Therefore,  construction  of  two  further  ring  roads,  i.e.,  RR3  and  RR4    on  the \nperiphery  of  HCMC  is  the  government\u2019s  strategic  priority  and  included  in  the  HCMC  transport \nmaster plan.3  \n \n4. \nThe  proposed  HCMC  RR3,  to  be  constructed  at  a  radius  of  about  25  km  from  the  city \ncenter, will facilitate the diversion of through traffic and reduce traffic congestion in HCMC. The \nRR3  will  also  improve  connectivity  with  the  surrounding  cities  and  towns,  and  help  reduce \ntransport  costs  and  travel  times  for  the  movement  of  passengers  and  goods  in  and  around \nHCMC.  Once  operational,  it  will  relieve  stress  from  other  arterial  routes  and  provide  needed \ncapacity. HCMC is also a hub for the primary regional and national transport corridors, such as \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ho Chi Minh City Outer \n\nRing Roads Project. Manila.  \n\n2  The government has requested Korea Eximbank to finance parts of the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section in the amount \nof  $200  million.  Currently  $200  million  for  this  section  has  been  earmarked  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \nordinary capital resources in 2016. \n\n3  The HCMC Transport Master Plan was approved in Decision 568/QD-TTg by the Prime Minister on 8 April 2013. \nThe Detailed Master Plan for RR3 was approved in Decision 1697/QD-TTg by the Prime Minister on 28 September \n2011 and corresponds with the HCMC Master Plan. \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  eastern  and  southern  corridors,  and  the  national  North\u2013South \nExpressway.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  together  with  other  development  partners, \nhas provided assistance to develop these radial corridors, which will be linked together via the \nHCMC RR3.4 The proposed RR3 is expected to sufficiently address the traffic capacity needs at \nleast  up  to  2020.  Consideration  for  a  RR4  or  a  viaduct  above  the  RR3  may  then  become \nnecessary. . \n \n5. \nConsidering the complexity of the HCMC RR3 investment project in terms of social and \nenvironmental,  as  well  as  technical  and  financial  aspects,  with  plans  for  private  sector \ninvolvement,  the  government  is  facing  constraints  in  its  capacity  to  develop  the  project \nindependently without any external support. To help implement its strategy, and to engage ADB \nas  the  potential  financier  for  the  ensuing  investment  project,  the  government  has  requested \nADB to provide a TA Project to ensure the investment project\u2019s design readiness, update cost \nestimates,  as  well  as  identify  feasible  financing  options  for  the  three  project  sections  of  the \nHCMC  RR3.  The  TA  Project  has  been  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan \n(COBP),  2013\u20132015,5 with  the  ensuing  HCMC  RR3  investment  project  in  COBP,  2015\u201320176 \nas  standby  for  2017.  The  feasibility  study,  including  the  basic  design  for  the  Tan  Van\u2013Nhon \nTrach  section,  was  prepared  in  2012  under  financing  from  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea.7 \nThe  TA  Project\u2019s  outline  was  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  on  27  March  2013.8 The  TA \nProject  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015  for  Viet  Nam,  which \nfocuses  on  assisting  the  country\u2019s  transport  sector  in  improving  its  institutional,  financial,  and \noperational  efficiency  to  maintain  sufficient  transport  infrastructure,  including  provincial  roads, \nnational highways, and expressways, and to improve road safety.9  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe impact of the project will be enhanced construction of the HCMC RR3, contributing \nto reduced traffic congestion in and improved connectivity of HCMC with surrounding cities and \ntowns. The outcome will be the design readiness of the HCMC RR3 project for financing. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe outputs of the project will be (i) completed detailed feasibility  and social safeguard \n7. \nstudies for the Ben Luc\u2013National Highway 22 and National Highway\u2013Binh Chuan sections; and \n(ii)  updated  due  diligence,  completed  detailed  design,  and  project  and  safeguard  documents \nrequired  to  finance  construction  of  the  Tan  Van\u2013Nhon  Trach  section  and  extension  road  to \nNational Highway 1.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $13.21  million,  inclusive  of  local  taxes,  contingencies \n8. \nand  financing  charges  during  development.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  1. \n\nInvestment and Financing  \n\n                                                 \n4   The  ADB-financed  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway  Project  connects  with  the  Ben \n\nLuc (ending point of the RR3) to Nhon Trach (starting point of the RR3). \n\n5  ADB. 2012.

The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per \nannum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  government  will  make  the  total  loan  amount  of \n$12.58 million available to MOT on a grant basis.  \n \n10. \nThe government will provide the counterpart funds of $0.63 million, which covers about \n4.8%  of  the  project  costs,  to  finance  the  value-added  tax  on  the  consulting  services  for  the \nfeasibility  study,  detailed  design  appraisal,  road  safety  audit,  independent  audit  of  project \nfinance accounts, and the project management cost. The counterpart funds will also cover parts \nof the contingency amount. The project financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nThe government has requested that ADB finance part of the taxes. The eligibility of taxes \n11. \nfor ADB financing was determined through a due diligence assessment, and followed the Viet \nNam  country  partnership  strategy  recommendation  for  financing  taxes  that  apply  to  ADB-\nfinanced  expenditures. 11  Based  on  the  results  of  the  assessment,  ADB  concluded  that  all \neligibility criteria had been met. \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nSDR million ($ equivalent) \n\nItem \nA.

The government has consulted HCMC, Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Long \nAn provinces to confirm the alignment and feasibility study findings.  \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n \n\nIn  the  first  phase,  the  RR3  project  sections  will  comprise  a  four-lane  expressway,  with \n17. \ntwo-lane service roads on both sides of the expressway, and a maximum total right-of-way width \nof 67 meters \u201374.5 meters.13 An additional four-lane expressway is proposed to be constructed \nin the future to meet RR3 traffic demand in 2030 by building a viaduct structure in the middle of \nthe RR3, which will result in lower land acquisition and resettlement costs than if a ground level \nexpressway was constructed. This detail will be finalized in the feasibility report. \n \n18. \nFuture efficient operation of the service roads along the RR3 will be important for local \npublic bus transportation, and local short-distance traffic, including motorized and non-motorized \nvehicles,  and  pedestrians.  This  will  be  taken  into  account  in  the  preparation  of  the  detailed \ndesigns under the TA Project by giving consideration to urban transportation facilities such as \nbus stops and public parking areas. Furthermore, overpass and underpass structures to cross \nthe  RR3,  and  intersections  and  interchanges  (with  existing  routes  and  those  currently  under \nconstruction)  will  be  designed  in  response  to  local  traffic  and  travel  demands,  ensuring \nconnectivity in line with national and provincial transport master plans. \n \nIn addition to technical, financial, economic and safeguards due diligence, the feasibility \n19. \nstudies will include preparation of a climate change assessment for both the National Highway \n22\u2013Binh  Chuan  and  the  Ben  Luc\u2013National  Highway  22  sections  of  the  RR3,  including  the \nfollowing: (i) overseeing and coordinating the implementation of a draft strategy for vulnerability, \nimpact, and adaptation assessments for the two road sections; (ii) identifying and discussing the \nadaptation  objective  with  all  relevant  stakeholders;  (iii)  synthesizing  vulnerability  and  impact \ninformation collected by other members of the team into the decision matrix provided by ADB; \n(iv)  organizing  and  leading  multi-stakeholder  consultations  to  identify  and  prioritize  adaptation \noptions  based  on  an  economic  assessment,  in  addition  to  any  other  prioritization  conditions \nidentified  (i.e.,  through  multi-criteria  analysis);  (v)  recommending  adaptation  options  in  a \npresentation to the government, ADB, and other relevant stakeholders; (vi) ensuring integration \nof adaptation components into the project design; and (vii) identifying additional training needs, \nindicators for monitoring, and funding for adaptation components as needed. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic assessment prepared under the TA for Preparing the Ho Chi Minh Outer \n20. \nRing Roads Project (footnote 1) shows that the ensuing RR3 project is economically viable, with \nan  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  16.6%.  The  net  present  value  of  net  benefits  using  a \ndiscount  rate  of  12%  is  $878  million.  The  financial  viability  of  and  financing  options  for  the \nHCMC  RR3  investment  are  not  conclusive  at  this  stage.  The  TA  consultants\u2019  presentation \nduring  the  loan  fact-finding  mission  in  November  2013  indicated  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  of  the  HCMC  RR3  would  be  10.4%\u201313.7%,  which  would  make  the  project  potentially \nattractive  to  financial  investors  (depending  on  their  respective  cost  of  capital).  However,  there \nare discrepancies between these and earlier figures. Therefore, a detailed financial analysis that \nthoroughly examines the financial viability of each project section of the HCMC RR3 investment \nis  needed.  The  TA  Project  will  reassess  the  economic  and  financial  viability  of  the  ensuing \ninvestment  project.  Moreover,  the  financial  analysis  under  the  TA  Project  will  explore  and \nidentify feasible financing options for the HCMC RR3 investment, including a standalone project \nloan, multitranche financing facility, and private sector investment.  \n \n\n                                                 \n13 Government of Viet Nam. 2013.

MOT  as  the  executing  agency  and  Cuu  Long  CIPM  as  the  implementing  agency  are \nfound  to  have  adequate  procurement  management  capacity  and  capability  for  project \nimplementation. MOT and Cuu Long CIPM have extensive experience implementing externally \nfinanced projects. Cuu Long CIPM is currently implementing the Central Mekong Delta Region \nConnectivity  Project  (CMDRCP),  financed  by  ADB, 14  for  which  it  has  mobilized  12  staff \nmembers from four different divisions (five from the Investment and Business Division, four from \nthe  Cao  Lanh  Bridge  Management  Division,  two  from  the  Financial  and  Accounting  Division, \nand  one  from  the  Cuu  Long  CIPM  Hanoi  Branch  Office).  Cuu  Long  CIPM  plans  to  mobilize  a \ntotal  of  seven  staff  members  for  the  HCMC  RR3  TA  Project  who  are  not  involved  in  the \nCMDRCP  (three  from  Investment  and  Business  Division,  one  from  Financial  and  Accounting \nDivision,  one  from  its  Hanoi  Branch  Office,  and  two  from  the  RR3  Project  Management \nDivision). Furthermore, a comprehensive capacity-building training program for Cuu Long CIPM \nis  included  in  the  ongoing  CMDRCP.  This  training  will  further  improve  the  skills  of  Cuu  Long \nCIPM staff in procurement and project administration. \n \n22. \nCuu  Long  CIPM  is  found  to  have  adequate  financial  management  capacity  and \ncapability  for  project  implementation,  and  is  sufficiently  staffed  with  experienced  accountants. \nGiven  that  the  accounting  staff  in  Cuu  Long  is  experienced  in  and  familiar  with  financial \nmanagement  practices  for  projects  funded  by  ADB,  and  that  Cuu  Long  CIPM  has  sound \nfinancial accounting, reporting, auditing, and internal control systems, the financial management \narrangements are considered capable of and adequate for implementing the project.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n23. \nwith the government and MOT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 9).  \n \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n24. \n(2012, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements between the government and \nADB. \n \nCuu  Long  CIPM  will  maintain  separate  financial  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \n25. \nidentify  financing  resources  received  and  project  expenditures,  including  goods,  works,  and \nservices  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  The  loan  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  Cuu  Long  CIPM  shall  prepare  and  submit  annual  audited  reports \nand related financial statements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The \nADB  Public  Communications  Policy  requires  that  audited  financial  statements  be  disclosed. \nFurther details on disbursement, auditing, and financial management are provided in the PAM \n(footnote  9).  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  project  financial  management,  an \nindependent  auditing  consultant  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  recruited  to  ensure  timely \nsubmission of audited financial reports under the TA loan.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nA  social  impact  assessment,  including  gender  analysis,  will  be  carried  out  during \nimplementation  of  the  project,  and  a  social  action  plan  will  be  prepared  to  ensure  that  social \nbenefits are maximized in a gender-responsive and culturally appropriate manner. \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2013.

Manila.  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n\n \n27. \nCuu  Long  CIPM,  with  assistance  from  the  feasibility  study  consultants,  will  undertake \npublic  consultations  in  the  project-affected  areas  during  the  preparation  of  the  environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) study for all sections of the proposed RR3 project. The consultations \nwill be done to inform the public about the project, to present anticipated environmental impacts, \nand  to  identify  relevant  environmental  issues  and  concerns  so  these  can  be  considered  and \naddressed in the EIA. Such consultations will involve local residents and business owners in the \nvicinity  of  the  project  area,  and  representatives  of  organizations  and  facilities  (e.g.,  schools, \nmedical  facilities,  places  of  worship,  and  offices)  that  will  be  affected  during  ongoing \nconstruction  and  operation.  Other  stakeholders  include  representatives  of  nongovernment \norganizations,  people\u2019s  organizations  (women,  youth,  etc.),  local  government  units,  and  other \nconcerned  government  agencies.  The  consultations  will  be  undertaken  early  in  the  EIA \npreparation  period  to  enable  relevant  concerns  raised  by  stakeholders  to  be  addressed  in  the \nEIA.  Another  consultation  will  present  the  draft  EIA  findings.  The  public  consultations  will  be \ndocumented in the EIA, which will be publicly disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n28. \nEnvironment. The project comprises preparatory work for the HCMC RR3 project, and \nwill involve preparation of an EIA. The project will include careful determination of the alignment, \navoiding  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  and  developing  environmentally  friendly  highway \ndesigns. An EIA has been prepared for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section of RR3 project under \nthe feasibility study financed by the Export-Import Bank of Korea in 2012.15 The feasibility study \nconsultant will prepare an EIA, based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), which will \ncover all three sections of the RR3 project. The consultant will also prepare separate EIAs for \nthe  Binh  Chuan\u2013National  Highway  22  section  and  National  Highway  22\u2013Ben  Luc  section \nfollowing  Viet  Nam\u2019s  environmental  requirements.  The  detailed  design  consultant  will  ensure \nthat  relevant  aspects  of  the  environmental  management  plan  included  in  the  EIA  (based  on \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement) are also included in the bidding and contract documents for \ncivil works. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  will  not  cause  any \nadverse involuntary resettlement impacts. However, construction of the RR3 will have significant \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts as a result of loss of agricultural and residential land.16 As part \nof  the  project,  the  detailed  design  consultant  and  detailed  feasibility  consultant  will  work  with \nMOT,  Cuu  Long  CIPM,  affected  households,  local  authorities,  and  other  stakeholders  in  the \npreparation  of  the  resettlement  plans  for  the  Tan  Van\u2013Nhon  Trach  Section  and  Binh  Chuan\u2013\nNational  Highway  22  and  National  Highway  22\u2013Ben  Luc  sections,  respectively,  in  accordance \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. It is anticipated that there will be no impacts on indigenous \npeoples  or  ethnic  groups,  but  this  will  be  confirmed  during  the  detailed  design  and  detailed \nfeasibility studies.  \n \n30. \nConsultation and disclosure plans will be part of the resettlement plans and social action \nplans  for  the  RR3  project  to  ensure  meaningful  consultation  and  provision  of  clear  and  timely \n\n                                                 \n15 The  EIA  was  endorsed  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  on  14  January  2013  and  is  being \n\nrevised prior to being resubmitted to the Ministry.   \n\n16 Based on a draft resettlement plan prepared for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach Section under the Export-Import Bank of \nKorea-financed  feasibility  study  in  2012,  about  285  hectares  of  land  will  be  affected,  and  an  estimated  1,200 \nhouseholds will be physically and economically displaced. No information is available on the estimated number of \naffected  households  for  the  Tan  Van\u2013Nhon  Trach  Section  and  Binh  Chuan\u2013National  Highway  22  and  National \nHighway 22\u2013Ben Luc sections, but it is expected that impacts are also significant for these sections.   \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\ninformation  to  the  affected  households  and  various  stakeholders.  The  consultation  and \ndisclosure plans will include consultation meetings, focus group discussions, separate meetings \nwith  women  and  vulnerable  households,  preparation  of  information  booklets,  and  use  of  radio \nand  TV  to  disseminate  information  about  the  project  and  associated  social  and  resettlement-\nrelated issues.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  main  risks  relate  to  potential  project  delays  caused  by  delay  in  government \n31. \napprovals  and  recruitment  of  consultants,  and  slow  implementation.  These  risks  will  be \nmitigated  by  engaging  with  the  government  to  ensure  timely  approvals,  carrying  out  advance \nactions on consultant recruitment, ensuring Cuu Long CIPM\u2019s has adequate human resources \nin  place,  and  ongoing  monitoring  of  project  implementation  progress  through  ADB  review \nmissions. \n \n32. \nThe  consultant  selection  process  and  implementation  of  the  consulting  services  may \nexperience delay. These risks will be mitigated by (i) MOT ensuring timely government approval \nto proceed with advance action, (ii) Cuu Long CIPM providing adequate staff resources to carry \nout  the  consultant  selection  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  time  schedule,  and  (iii)  Cuu  Long \nCIPM taking strong ownership and working together with the consultants to ensure effective and \ntimely implementation of the project. Furthermore, ADB will carry out several review missions to \nmonitor the project\u2019s progress. The government\u2019s overall approval processes are also potential \ncause  for  delay.  Cuu  Long  CIPM  has  consulted  HCMC,  Binh  Duong  and  Dong  Nai  provinces \nand confirmed the final alignment of the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section of RR3 and the extension \nroad  to  National  Highway  1,  which  provides  the  necessary  readiness  to  proceed  with  the \nproject.  \n \n33. \nThe government\u2019s approval of the overall feasibility study and the detailed design for the \nabove  mentioned  sections  will  be  subject  to  confirmation  of  all  financing  sources,  which  may \ncause delays to the processing and implementation of the RR3 investment project. To mitigate \nthis risk, the government\u2019s early coordination with potential financiers and prompt confirmation \nof financing availability is needed. Furthermore, because the future RR3 will be fully funded and \noperated  by  various  entities,  including  Cuu  Long  CIPM  and  private  investors,  collaboration \nbetween  these  entities  and  related  local  governments  is  critical,  and  must  be  ensured  and \nmaintained throughout the preparation, implementation, and operation and maintenance stages. \nMOT  therefore  needs  to  develop  and  obtain  mutual  agreement  from  the  provinces  or  cities \ninvolved in each phase of the project regarding the scope and accountability for implementation \nand operation and maintenance prior to commencing RR3 implementation.  \n \n34. \nIn  addition  to  the  above  described  risks  some  concerns  on  governance  in  terms  of \nintegrity violations and corruption exists. However, since the project only includes recruitment of \nconsulting services the governance risk is not considered significant. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 Overall, \nthe benefits and positive impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe government, MOT, and Cuu Long CIPM have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \n\n                                                 \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n \n\nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n36. \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \n\nThe  government,  MOT,  and  Cuu  Long  CIPM  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n37. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR8,475,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Ho  Chi \nMinh City Third Ring Road Technical Assistance Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for \na term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n30 January 2015  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nEnhanced  construction \nof \nthe  HCMC  RR3, \ncontributing  to  reduced \nin \ntraffic  congestion \nand \nimproved \nconnectivity  of  HCMC \nwith  surrounding  cities \nand towns. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nProject progress \nreports to be prepared \nby Cuu Long CIPM \n \n \nAnnual operational \nplan of Cuu Long \nCIPM  \n \n \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines \n\n \nFunding for the RR3 \nsecured from various \nsources secured by \n2017 \n(Baseline data: as per \nADB COBP, 2015-\n2017, $287 million from \nADB and $200 million \nfrom cofinancing \nearmarked for HCMC \nRR3 in the 2017 \npipeline) \n \n \nCompletion of the Tan \nVan\u2013Nhon Trach \nsection including an \nextension road to NH1 \nby 2021 \n(Baseline data: 0 km \ncompleted in 2014) \n \n \n \nProject documents for \nthe HCMC RR3 project \ncompleted by Q2/ 2017 \n(Baseline data: none) \n \n \n \n \n\nOutcome \nDesign readiness of \nthe HCMC RR3 project \nfor financing  \n \n \n\n \nMeetings with the \nGovernment of Viet \nNam, Cuu Long CIPM, \nand cofinanciers \n \n\nOutputs  \n1.
