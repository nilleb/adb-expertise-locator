THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand partial risk guarantee to Uch-II Power (Private) Limited (Uch-II Power) for the Uch-II Power \nProject. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working closely with the Pakistan Power \nand Infrastructure Board (PPIB) to identify independent power producers (IPPs) that would best \nmatch ADB's goal of supporting the development of both the power industry and the private \nsector in Pakistan. This close collaboration between ADB and the PPIB led to the identification \nof the proposed project. The project was one of the three power projects that the PPIB bid out in \nMarch 2007. The projects were bid out through international competitive bidding to ensure tariff \ncompetitiveness  and  transparency.  A  consortium  of  International  Power  from  the  United \nKingdom and Creative Energy Resources from the United Arab Emirates, which are also the \nmain shareholders of Uch Power (Private) Limited (Uch Power), the company that is operating \nthe Uch Power (Uch-I) Project, submitted a proposal for development of a 404 megawatt (MW) \ncombined-cycle power plant to be located at the Uch-I project site. Like the Uch-I project, the \nUch-II plant will use low British thermal unit (BTU) gas from the Uch gas reservoir as the primary \nfuel. After a detailed evaluation, the PPIB gave approval in August 2008 for the consortium to \ndevelop the project further. \n \nB.  Sector Performance \n1.  Demand and Supply Gap of Electricity \n3.  Addition  of  power  generation  capacity  in  Pakistan  is  a  matter  of  utmost  urgency. \nPakistan\u2019s power industry faces a major supply deficit that is constraining the country\u2019s already \nfragile economic growth. As compared with 18,926 MW peak demand in mid-2010, the country \nhad only 14,723 MW firm supplies, resulting in a shortfall of 4,203 MW (or  22.2% of the \ncountry's peak electricity demand).1 As of June 2010, the country\u2019s installed power generation \ncapacity was 20,375 MW, of which approximately 55% was owned and operated by government \nentities and 45% by independent power producers and/or majority private operators. Appendix 3 \nprovides more details on Pakistan\u2019s power sector. \n \n4.  Although electricity sales and demand have risen by more than 40% during the last 5 \nyears, investment in new generation capacity has lagged behind. The resultant power shortage \nhas led to ever increasing incidents of brownouts and blackouts in all major urban centers. \nMeasures to ration consumption are already being taken. Even with the economic slowdown \nand dislocations caused by the flooding in 2010, power demand is expected to continue to \nincrease, and latent demand is considered substantial. Left unattended, the country\u2019s power \ndeficit will continue to worsen and adversely impact Pakistan\u2019s economy.  \n \n                                                \n1  Private Power and Infrastructure Board. http://www.ppib.gov.pk/SupplyDemand.html \n ", "2   \n2.  Primary Energy and Fuel Mix \n5.  Pakistan urgently needs to develop indigenous energy resources. The power industry in \nPakistan is a mix of thermal, hydro, and nuclear power plants. Thermal power plants, which use \nimported fuel oil to meet almost 52% of their fuel needs (the balance is based on gas), account \nfor 67.6% of installed capacity; hydro plants account for 30.3%, and nuclear plants provide the \nremaining 2%. Coal-fired thermal plants account for only 0.1%. Originally, the ratio of hydro to \nthermal installed generation capacity in the country was about 2:1 (in 1985). Over time, more \nthermal generation capacity was installed, leaving the country heavily dependent on imported oil \nfor its primary fuel requirements. Rising oil imports have caused the country\u2019s current account \ndeficit to increase. They have also caused considerable price escalation and volatility. High \nelectricity tariffs are eroding the viability and affordability of the sector. \n \n3.  Financial Position \n6.  The \u2015circular debt problem\u2016 impedes the progress of power generation expansion and \nsours the mood of existing and potential investors in Pakistan's power industry. Circular debt \nstarts with accumulation of payables by the Government of Pakistan to distribution companies, \nwhich are passed on to the generators and then to fuel suppliers. This circular debt causes \ndelays in fuel supply to power generators, affecting generation capacity. Distribution companies \nare  not  able  to  charge  the  full  cost-recovery  tariff  determined  by  National  Electric  Power \nRegulatory Authority (NEPRA). The government has insulated low-income power consumers by \nproviding  subsidies  to  distribution  companies,  but  there  have  been  delays  in  government \npayments. This has resulted in revenue shortfalls for distribution companies and temporary \ndeferment of payments to nearly all power plants in the system. Power generation companies \nhave seen their receivables rise, and generation companies have been forced to stop, delay, or \nreduce  payments  to  their  fuel  suppliers  to  balance  their  cash  flows.  This  has  negatively \nimpacted generation capacity. This issue is not new and has been partially mitigated in the past. \nHowever, it is once again becoming a growing problem that must be resolved if the potential of \nthe  private  sector  to  address  Pakistan\u2019s  power  deficit  is  to  be  unleashed.  Measures  are \nunderway, but challenges remain. \n \n4.  Response by the Government of Pakistan \n7.  To address the energy shortage and growing power crisis, the government has decided \nto implement several energy expansion initiatives, with an emphasis on developing indigenous \nresources. These initiatives include expanding thermal and hydropower generation capacity by \nindependent power producers (IPPs) under the government\u2019s Power Policy 2002, procuring \npower from rental  power  plants  under  short-term  agreements,  securing  electricity  and gas \nimports from regional projects, and tapping into the huge potential of renewable energy sources. \nThe government is also exploring the possibility of using its domestic coal reserves, which are \namong the largest in the world (albeit low quality and remotely located). However, the time \nhorizon for domestic coal-fired power generation is relatively long term. In the short to medium \nterm, it is expected that both conventional (i.e., thermal) and renewable energy\u2014predominantly \nhydro  and  wind\u2014will  be  the  mainstays  of  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  supply.  Simultaneously, \nimproving transmission and distribution efficiency is a key area of focus, and ADB has been \nassisting the government\u2019s program through its public sector operations.2 \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Power Distribution Enhancement Investment. Manila; \n ", "  3  \n \n8.  The government has started efforts to resolve the circular debt problem by increasing \nconsumer tariffs and by transferring the debt in the system to a newly established company \noutside of the energy sector. ADB continues to support the government\u2019s sector reform program \nunder the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program.3 \n \n9.  The reform and restructuring of the sector has been supported by major development \npartners such as ADB and the World Bank, but progress has been slow and protracted and \nmany areas have lagged behind expectations.4 The appointment of independent boards of \ndirectors, critical for autonomy and commercial discipline, needs to be pushed and political \ninterference needs to be reduced. Another important measure required to move toward full \ncommercialization of the power industry is to make the Central Power Purchasing Authority \neffective  as  an  autonomous  body  to  ensure  financial  transparency  and  accountability. \nInsufficient reform of end-consumer tariffs, delinquent customer accounts, and other institutional \nfactors are major hurdles to reforming and improving the poor financial health of the sector. \n \n5.  Private Sector Investment in Pakistan \n10.  Pakistan has undertaken wide ranging reforms in the energy sector with the help of ADB \nand  the  World  Bank.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  government,  recognizing  that  the  required \ninvestment in the sector could not be provided by the public sector alone, restructured and \nopened Pakistan\u2019s energy sector to private investment. Since then, Pakistan has had a long \nhistory of private sector involvement in the energy sector, and about a third of generation is \nprovided by IPPs. During the past 2 years, nine IPPs representing almost 2,000 MW of installed \ncapacity have achieved financial close under the Power Policy 2002. Most have already been \ncommissioned, and all are expected to start commercial operation by end-2010 or early 2011. \n \n11.  ADB has taken the lead in supporting the government\u2019s initiative to attract private capital \ninto  the  energy  sector  and  has  been  instrumental  in  many  pioneering  transactions.  ADB \nfinanced the first private hydropower project, the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project.5 This \ntransaction has set the precedent for many follow-on private hydropower projects in Pakistan, \nseveral  of  which  ADB  is  considering.  ADB  has  also  provided  equity  and  a  partial  credit \nguarantee for a gas-fired combined cycle power project, the Daharki Power Project, using \nindigenous gas.6 To further encourage investment in the energy sector, the government has \ntaken steps to privatize state-owned power companies\u2014both generation plants and distribution \nnetworks. ADB helped the government privatize the Karachi Electric Supply Company, and, in \n2007, ADB provided a loan for the privatized entity to expand its generation, transmission, and \n                                                                                                                                                       \nADB. 2009.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n12.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework (Strategy 2020), \nwhich emphasizes investment in infrastructure to achieve high sustainable economic progress, \nconnect the poor to markets, and increase their access to basic productive assets, as part of \nADB\u2019s  support  for  achieving  inclusive  growth.9 Strategy  2020  puts  particular  emphasis  on \nexpanding energy supplies and promoting energy efficiency through supply-side measures. \nStrategy 2020 also emphasizes, among five drivers of change, (i) private sector development \nand private sector operations, and (ii) partnerships. The proposed assistance will promote a \nlarger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure, and will catalyze private investment \nthrough ADB\u2019s credit enhancement product. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n13.  ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with the country partnership strategy for Pakistan, \n2009\u20132013, which emphasizes the importance of energy sector development, private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, and expansion of ADB's private sector operations in \nthe energy sector.10 The project is a logical continuation of ADB\u2019s development and reform \nefforts in Pakistan's energy sector, which have been designed to promote a well-regulated, \nmarket-oriented power industry. Energy infrastructure has featured prominently in ADB's private \nsector operations in Pakistan. \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Sector Strategy \n14.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, and is particularly consistent with one of \nthe three pillars of that policy\u2014maximizing access to energy for all.11 Access to modern and \nreliable energy services fosters sustainable human development, economic growth, a higher \nquality of life, and improved delivery of social services. The project will add generation capacity \nand increase the reliability of electricity supplies in a country facing a severe power shortage. \nThe project will promote the use of a low-cost indigenous fuel to generate electricity. Electricity \nsupplied by the project will be more affordable than existing supplies, and will not be affected by \nthe volatility of the international fuel market. The project will operate at high efficiency and will \nbe more environmentally friendly than power plants that use other fossil fuels. By promoting the \nuse of indigenous resources, the project will also contribute to the country\u2019s energy security. \n \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2007.

Uch-II  Power  will  be  wholly  owned  by  International  Power,  and  will  implement  the \nproject.  \n \n16.  International Power is a leading independent power generation company with interests in \n32,358 MW of gross generation capacity and 20,671 MW of net generation capacity worldwide. \nInternational Power has operations across five regions, namely North America, Europe, the \nMiddle East, Australia, and Asia. Along with shares in power generators, the company also has \ninterests in desalination, steam generation, and energy retail. Through its corporate history, \nInternational Power has gained experience in all phases of the power generation chain, \nincluding  development,  construction,  operation,  trading  and,  marketing.  Its  focus  is  on \ngenerating low-cost, affordable power in countries that encourage foreign investment and \nhave high demand growth. \n \n17.  International Power has been increasing its presence as a power plant developer in \nPakistan since the 1990s, when it began investing in overseas power privatization programs. \nOver time, International Power has become the single largest private investor in Pakistan\u2019s \npower generation industry. In 1993, National Power, a legacy company of International Power, \ninvested  in  the  Hub  Power  Company,  which  became  the  first  IPP  in  Pakistan.12 In  1996, \nInternational Power purchased shares in Kot Addu Power Company, and in 1994 took a portion \nof shares in Uch Power.13 International Power's three Pakistan projects have demonstrated \nsound financial performance underpinned by long-term power purchase agreements.  \n \n \n2.  Project Design \n18.  The Uch-II project is in the Dera Murad Jamali subdistrict of Balochistan  Province, \napproximately 600 kilometers (km) north of Karachi and 42 km northwest of Jacobabad. It is \nlocated on the premises of the Uch-I power station, which is surrounded by a boundary wall \ncovering an area of approximately 260 hectares (ha). The project will require approximately 63 \nha including an area for residential and recreational facilities associated with the project. \n \n19.  The  project  will  consist  of  two  gas  turbine  generators,  two  heat  recovery  steam \ngenerators,  one  steam  turbine  generator,  one  condenser  and  multicell  cooling  tower,  and \nbalance-of-plant equipment. The project will use low-BTU gas and a high-speed diesel dual fuel \ncombustion system. Low-BTU gas is the primary fuel, but distillate liquid fuel will be used for \nstart up and shut down because these activities are not feasible with low-BTU gas. \n \n20.  Electricity generated from the Uch-II project will be stepped up to 220 kV for connection \nto  the  220  kV  switchyard.  This  switchyard  will  supply  power  directly  to  the  National \nTransmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) at its outlet gantries. The NTDC will be responsible \nfor interconnection of the project to the national grid. \n \n                                                \n12  International Power\u2019s current share in Hub Power Company is 17%. \n13 International Power\u2019s current share in Kot Addu Power Company is 36%, and share in Uch Power is 75%. \n ", "6   \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n21.  The outcome of the project will be additional electricity supplies of 2,799 gigawatt hours \n(GWh) annually at an attractive tariff. The project will generate electricity by using competitively \npriced indigenous gas, and the tariff for electricity supplied by the project will be lower than that \nfor plants that use imported fuel. \n \n22.  The primary output of the project will be net additional installed capacity of 375.2 MW, \nwhich  is  equivalent  to  8.9%  of  the  energy  shortfall  in  the  country.  In  addition,  during \nconstruction, it is expected that locally purchased goods and services will amount to $50 million, \nand 600\u2013800 local jobs will be created. \n \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction through Private \nSector Development \n23.  The project will help alleviate Pakistan's severe power shortage, which is adversely \nimpacting  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  efforts.  The  project  will \nincrementally  increase  access  to  energy  for  households,  business,  and  industry.  Use  of \nindigenous natural resources will result in more affordable electricity and tariffs that are less \nsusceptible to fluctuations in the international fuel and the foreign currency markets. Use of \nindigenous fuel will also relieve pressure on the country\u2019s balance of payments. The project will \nfurther demonstrate the advantageousness of private participation in power generation, and \nmay increase general investor and lender confidence in Pakistan. In the long run, the project will \ncontribute to reduction of power shortages and development of indigenous power sources. \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment \n24.  The project is classified as environmental category A, requiring an environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social impacts were adequately assessed in the EIA report (January 2010) \nand  EIA  report  addendum  (October  2010).  The  EIA  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nPakistan regulations and procedures, and the addendum with revised information was prepared \nin response to ADB comments. The EIA report was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 7 July 2010 \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), while the addendum will also be \nposted on the website. \n \n25.  Potential  adverse  project  impacts  include  a  decline  in  air  quality,  an  increase  in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, increased use of water, and an increase in liquid waste generation. \nThese adverse impacts will be adequately mitigated where feasible, as described in the EIA \nreport  and  addendum.  Uch-II  Power  is  deemed  to  have  sufficient  capacity  to  manage \nenvironmental and social issues. The project is sited on land acquired by Uch Power, located \nwithin the Uch-I fenced compound on mostly vacant land. The locality is arid and fairly remote, \nwith no ecologically sensitive sites. \n \n26.  The maximum rates of plant emissions will be within Pakistan National Environmental \nQuality Standards (NEQS) limits and International Finance Corporation (IFC) guidelines for \n\u2015fuels other than natural gas\u2016 (applied because low-BTU gas is of different quality than \u2015natural \n ", "  7  \ngas\u2016)  for  all  major  pollutants,  including  5  milligrams  per  normal  cubic  meter  (mg/Nm\u00b3)  of \nparticulate matter of 10 micrometers size or less (PM ) (against the IFC limit of 50 mg/Nm\u00b3), 77 \n10\nmg/Nm3 of oxides of nitrogen (IFC limit: 152 mg/Nm3) and 0.18 tons per day (t/day) of sulfur \ndioxide  (NEQS  limit:  500  t/day).  The  projected  incremental  increase  in  ground-level \nconcentrations of oxides of sulfur and oxides of nitrogen occurring as a result of the project is \nlow at 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter (\uf06dg/m3) and 5.9 \uf06dg/m3, respectively. Both are within \nNEQS limits. The increase in the PM  24-hour ground-level concentration will be just 0.4 \uf06dg/m3. \n10\nThe cumulative worst-case PM  24-hour ground-level concentration of 100.0 \uf06dg/m3 is lower \n10\nthan the World Health Organization (WHO) interim target-1 (150 \uf06dg/m3), but higher than the \nWHO guideline (50 \uf06dg/m3) because of naturally high ambient levels of particulate matter (WHO \nguidelines are applicable under IFC guidelines when there is no national standard). Offsetting \nthis projected increase in ambient PM  levels is not feasible as there are no identifiable sources \n10\nof particulate matter other than natural causes and the Uch-I power plant. \n \n27.  The project is expected to produce 2.125 million t of carbon dioxide (CO ) per year, a \n2\nreduction of about 64,000 t of CO annually over conventional boilers burning oil (the main type \n2 \nof generation currently supplying the grid), or a reduction of about 494,000 t of CO annually \n2 \nover coal-fired thermal generation. CO  emissions will be quantified and reported annually. \n2\nOffsetting CO  emissions occurring as a result of the project will not be possible with local tree \n2\nplanting because of the arid conditions surrounding the plant site and the large volume of water \nrequired if irrigation were to be undertaken. \n \n28.  Water use for the project will total 10,300 m3/day during operation. Water use will be \nminimized  by  vertical  draft  cooling  towers  with  continuous  cooling  water  reticulation;  close \nmonitoring of cooling water chemistry to optimize use; and water conservation in the colony. All \nproject water requirements will be reallocated from the Uch-I plant's water allocation, which is \nonly  partially  used,  thus  causing  minimal  impact  on  existing  users.  A  \u2015zero  discharge\u2016 \nwastewater treatment system will be installed to treat 1,238 m3 of effluent per day. All treated \neffluent will be discharged into an on-site evaporation pond for tertiary treatment. Water quality \nin this pond will in general comply with NEQS and IFC guidelines. Total dissolved solids and \nchlorine (residual) will be above NEQS limits, and total suspended solids and chlorine (residual) \nmay breach IFC limits, but this is acceptable given that there will be no discharge from the pond \nto any other surface water. Minimal infiltration will occur from the pond because of the very low \npermeability of the silty clay subsoil. \n \n2.  Social Dimensions \n29.  The project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous people \nsafeguards. The project will be constructed on 83.5 ha (206 acres) within the fenced property of \nUch Power, which has a total land area 260 ha (642 acres) in Dera Murad Jamali, Balochistan. \nThe land for the project will be leased to Uch-II Power by Uch Power. Uch Power acquired its \nland  in  1996;  it  was  previously  owned  by  the  government  and  private  landowners. \nCompensation has been fully paid to the original owners at above-fair-market value plus the \nmandated 25% additional cost of acquisition following the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act \nof 1894. The land where the Uch-II plant will be constructed has no occupants or signs of \noccupancy, and no outstanding issues with land acquisition. The tribal communities outside the \nproject area are inhabited by the Bhangar, Bangul-zai, Bahrani, Jamali, Jakhrani, and Khosa \ntribes, among others. Although the residents of the villages near the project area may have \ntribal affiliations, the project will not in any way affect their dignity, human rights, livelihood \nsystems, or culture. This is demonstrated by the operation of the similar Uch-I plant in the area \n ", "8   \nfor 10 years. Moreover, the land where the project will be constructed is not owned, used, \noccupied, or claimed as ancestral domain or asset by any of these groups. \n \n3.  Consultation and Participation Process \n30.  Consultations with local communities reached a wide segment of the population in the \nproject area and took the form of formal and informal meetings, focus group discussions, and in-\ndepth interviews. Information related to the project was discussed and various stakeholders \nwere  encouraged  to  voice  their  concerns  and  opinions.  Feedback  obtained  from  the \nstakeholders was documented, and all issues and suggestions raised were recorded. Three key \nissues were raised during the detailed consultations in 11 villages: (i) giving priority to local \nvillagers  for  project-related  employment  and  activities,  (ii)  ensuring  that  community  water \nresources are not overexploited, and (iii) ensuring that traffic is managed so as not to jeopardize \nthe safety of the communities. Mitigating measures were incorporated in the project design to \naddress these issues. \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Construction Arrangements \n31.  During construction, the project technical team will be headed by a project manager who \nwill coordinate with the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, and with \nthe owner\u2019s engineer. The project manager will be experienced in power plant management and \nwill be responsible for meeting the plant\u2019s pre-operations requirements. \n \n32.  The project will be constructed under an EPC contract performed by an experienced \ncontractor consortium.  \n \n2.  Operations Arrangements \n33.  Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project will be carried out by Uch Power under \nan O&M agreement. A dedicated O&M team may also be added. All maintenance work will be \ncarried out as per the recommendations of the original equipment manufacturer. \n \n34.  As the sponsor of the project, International Power will also play an important role in the \nproject\u2019s O&M. Uch-II Power will implement International Power's policies, procedures, and \nstandards\u2014particularly in the areas of environment, health, and safety management\u2014and will \nbe subject to periodic audits to monitor compliance in these areas. The project will also leverage \nInternational Power\u2019s global resources and network (i.e., technical support) and benefit from its \nindustry experience and best practices. \n \n3.  Gas Supply \n35.  The project\u2019s fuel will be low-BTU gas from the Uch gas field, which is 47 km away from \nthe project site. Gas will be supplied by Oil & Gas Development Company (OGDC) under a 25-\nyear take-or-pay gas supply agreement (GSA).  \n \n ", "  9  \n4.  Power Offtake \n36.  The NTDC is the power offtaker and will purchase electricity from the project under a 25-\nyear take-or-pay power purchase agreement (PPA). The tariff payable by the NTDC will be \nconsistent with the tariff determined by the NEPRA. The project will supply base load electricity.  \n \n5.  Role of the Government of Pakistan \n37.  The government plays a crucial role for the project as well as for other IPPs in Pakistan. \nIts obligations are set out under an implementation agreement with Uch-II Power. Under the \nimplementation agreement, the government grants the company the exclusive right to develop, \nown, and operate the project using gas from the Uch gas reserve, subject to applicable laws, \nregulations, and certain other obligations, for a period of 25 years. Among the principal functions of \nthe implementation agreement is to provide assurances to the company, International Power, and \nlenders that the various government entities and agencies will meet their contractual obligations\u2014\nincluding paying dues on time.  \n \n6.  Procurement  \n38.  The EPC contractor was selected through international competitive bidding. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy  \n39.  Uch-II Power was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the company to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and Uch-II Power will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n40.  Uch-II  Power  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements, \nquarterly construction or operations reports, and annual operating budgets to ADB and the other \nlenders,  and must report  any  material  changes. The  company  will  be  required to  hire  an \ninternationally reputable accounting firm (or its local affiliate) to audit its annual accounts in line \nwith  international  financial  reporting  standards.  ADB  will  monitor  the  project\u2019s  construction \nprogress and operation performance, using information from public sources, lender\u2019s advisors, \nand government statistics. The project will be evaluated on two levels: (i) success of the project, \nincluding its completion, commissioning, and operation; and (ii) impacts beyond the project, \nincluding the country\u2019s economic growth and the increase of private sector participation in \nPakistan\u2019s energy sector. The performance indicators are included in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \n \n ", "10   \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  ADB Loan \n41.  The proposed loan of up to $100 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources without government guarantee. The loan amount will not exceed 25% of the final total \nproject cost approved by the NEPRA upon completion. Proceeds of the loan will be used for \neligible capital expenditures and civil works for the project. \n \n2.  ADB Partial Risk Guarantee \n42.  The  proposed  partial  risk  guarantee  (PRG)  will  be  extended  without  government \ncounterindemnity in favor of commercial lenders that will provide direct loans of up to $50 million \nto Uch-II Power (ADB-guaranteed loan). Proceeds of the ADB-guaranteed loan will be used for \nthe project\u2019s costs and expenditures. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n43.  The proposed assistance by ADB to the project is justified for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  the project will add significant power generation capacity, which will help reduce \nload  shedding  in  Pakistan  and  strengthen  the  supply  network  and  stabilize \nvoltage in the province of Balochistan; \n \n(ii)  the project will use an unused and economically attractive indigenous energy \nresource to supply affordable electricity and reduce reliance on expensive oil \nimports. This will significantly reduce the volatility of the project\u2019s electricity tariff \nand relieve stress on Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore, it will \ncontribute to Pakistan\u2019s energy security. \n \n(iii)  the project will create revenue opportunities for the gas industry, and will also \ncreate job opportunities for local people during construction and operation of the \nproject  and  will  support  socioeconomic  advancement  in  a  remote  and \neconomically deprived area of Balochistan. \n \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s active participation and presence in the project will reassure the sponsor, \nInternational Power, and other lenders that the  government and government \nentities  will  continue  to  support  the  project.  Given  ADB\u2019s  track  record  and \nongoing  engagement  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector\u2014including  policy  dialogue, \npublic sector reform programs, and recent financing of key IPPs through private \nsector operations\u2014project participants will value ADB\u2019s role in mitigating risk, \nsolving problems, and catalyzing financial resources to support private sector \npower projects in Pakistan. \n \n(v)  ADB's assistance is considered indispensable to achieve financial close. The \nlong-term  financing  that  ADB  will  provide  is  essential  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the project, and would not otherwise be easily available under \nthe present financial and country environment. \n \n ", "  11  \n(vi)  Consistent with ADB\u2019s mandate to mobilize financing from other sources, the \nproposed  PRG  (coupled  with  the  presence  of  the  ADB  loan)  will  catalyze \nfinancing from commercial lenders. \n \n(vii)  The  proposed  assistance  to  the  project  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment plan and ADB\u2019s operational strategies as discussed in this report. \n \nC.  Assurances \n44.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Pakistan will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to Uch-II Power (Private) Limited. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, \nin form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the \nBoard of Directors. \n \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and partial risk guarantee would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the loan of up to $100,000,000 to Uch-II Power (Private) Limited for the Uch-II \nPower Project in Pakistan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and \n \n(ii)  the  partial  risk  guarantee  with  a  maximum  aggregate  liability  of  up  to \n$100,000,000, without government counter-indemnity, to guarantee up to 100% \nof scheduled payments of principal and interest under commercial loans of up to \n$50,000,000 to Uch-II Power (Private) Limited for the Uch-II Power Project in \nPakistan. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n19 November 2010   \n ", " 1  2         Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nAssumptions \nDesign Summary  and Indicators with  Reporting \nand Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpacts       \nEconomic growth in  Peak shortages and energy  Government and ADB  Assumptions \nPakistan is less  outages reduced by 11% by  statistics  Government continues to allow \nconstrained by deficient  2020  tariffs that provide reasonable \npower supply  Private power generation  returns to private investors \nIncreased investments  increases to 50% by 2020   \nby the private sector in    Risks \npower generation \nprojects in Pakistan  Pakistan is not able to increase its \nindigenous gas production to sustain \n \nincremental power capacity \nCircular debt not resolved, forcing \nsome shutdowns of existing capacity \nDeterioration in macroeconomic \nand/or political climate in Pakistan \nOutcome       \nProduction of low-cost  Project dispatches an  Government/NTDC/  Assumptions \nelectricity  estimated average annual  NPCC statistics  Reliable transmission and \n  production of 2,838 GWh  ADB research  distribution network with sufficient \nThe net average tariff per  Project reporting  capacity to dispatch power \nKWh from the project is  Sufficient gas supply  \nlower than for plants running \nElectricity output of the project adds \non imported fuel from 2013 \nto the output during peak hours but \nto 2028 \ndoes not replace the output of more \nexpensive generation alternatives \n \nRisk \nCircular debt not resolved, forcing \nsome shutdowns of existing capacity \nOutputs       \nConstruction and  Pakistan\u2019s electricity  Project reporting  Assumptions \noperation of a power  generation capacity  Project construction  Project reaches completion and \nplant running on  increases by 375.2 MW (net)  report and completion  starts operation as scheduled.  \nindigenous gas  on commissioning  certification by lenders\u2019  Sufficient gas supply \nMobilization of debt  Locally purchased goods  technical advisor \nQualifications of locals are matched \nfrom international  and services amount to $50  ADB review mission  with the employment requirements \nlenders to help close  million by 2013 \n  during construction. \nthe financing gap  600\u2013800 people locally \nADB PRG helps lenders overcome \n  employed during \ntheir hurdles to provide required \nconstruction by 2013 \nlong-term financing. \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with the Pakistan country partnership strategy (CPS)a and the government\u2019s strategic \nemphasis on energy sector development. As per the ADB CPS, \u2015ADB views itself as one of Pakistan\u2019s strategic development \npartners for infrastructure development,\u2016 with power as one of the main areas of support, and \u2015the emphasis on lending for \neconomic infrastructure will be continued, which is consistent with the high priority attached to it in the government\u2019s Medium \nTerm Development Framework.\u2016 The proposed project also conforms to the cross-cutting theme of sustainable environmental \nmanagement, as reflected in the CPS. Lastly, the CPS mandates that ADB develop greater complementarity between its \npublic and private sector operations. It places specific emphasis on the role of the private sector as a driver of investment \ngrowth and employment. The project will tap gas from a nearby gas reservoir to generate power that will be made available to \nalleviate the country's power supply deficiency. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: General Intervention  \n \nKey issues. During construction, the project will employ construction workers from nearby communities, thereby augmenting \nthe incomes of local households. This will in turn lead to the creation of small enterprises to service the construction \nworkforce. During operation, the presence of power plant personnel and contractors will increase local demand for food and \nservices, thus benefiting local business. The project is expected to implement local development programs through the \ncorporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The CSR initiatives are mainly focused on (i) socioeconomic development \nprojects mainly in Balochistan Province's Naseerabad District and surrounding areas; and (ii) other noteworthy causes in \nBalochistan and in the rest of the country (e.g., provision of food assistance to thousands of affected individuals during the \n2010 Indus river flooding). \n \nDesign features. The project has no specific technical design feature that is relevant to poverty reduction except for the \nexpected implementation of the CSR initiatives, which are discussed in more detail in the social analysis and strategy section \nbelow.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nKey issues. An environmental and social impact assessment, social compliance audit on prior land acquisition, and due \ndiligence on other social dimensions were undertaken for the project. These reports concluded that the construction and \noperation of the project power plant are not expected to have adverse social impacts. Key findings are as follows: \n \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project will be constructed on 83.5 hectares (ha; 206 acres) within the fenced property of Uch \nPower, which has a total land area of 260 ha (642 acres). The land for the project is being leased by Uch Power to the project \ncompany, Uch-II Power. The total landholding of Uch Power was acquired from the government of Balochistan in 1996. \nCompensation has been fully paid to the original owners (portions of the land were privately held and portions were \ngovernment land) at above-fair-market value plus the mandated 25% additional cost of acquisition following the provisions of \nthe Land Acquisition Act of 1894. The land where the project will be constructed has no occupants or sign of occupancy. \nThere are no outstanding issues with land acquisition, and Uch Power confirms that it has not received any complaints or \ngrievances emanating from the original owners of the land.  \n \nThe land and surrounding areas are arid and not suitable for agriculture, with low population density.  \n \nIndigenous peoples. There are eight villages near the project area: three on the southern side, one on the western side, two \non the northern side, and two near the access road leading to the site. These villages are composed of 169 households \nwhose main tribal affiliations are as follows: Bhangar, Bangul-zai, Bahrani, Jamali, Jakhrani, and Khosa. Other tribes in these \nvillages are: Bbbor, Brohi, Bugti, Gola, Jat, Kaprani, Lahri, Lango, Lanha, Lashari, Machi, Marri, Pechwa, Raeesani, Solangi, \nand Soomro. \n \n ", "14      Appendix 2 \n \nAlthough the residents of the villages located near the project area may have tribal affiliations, the experience of the Uch-I \nplant, which has been operating in the project area for 10 years, indicates that the project will not in any way affect their \ndignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture. Moreover, the land where the project will be constructed is not owned, \nused, occupied, or claimed as ancestral domain or asset by any of these groups. \n \nLabor and working conditions. Pakistan has ratified all International Labour Organization fundamental conventions covering \nthe four core labor standards. These are embodied in the Constitution and in the Industrial Relations Ordinance (IRO) of \n2002. Uch Power has demonstrated its commitment to following the 2002 IRO, and has a human resources policy and \nmanuals that cover employee benefits, equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, grievance mechanism, and others. Uch-II Power \nwill implement the same policies. \n \nCorporate social responsibility (CSR). Uch Power engages the neighboring communities and villages and the wider \ncommunity where it does business through CSR initiatives. It has robust CSR programs that are geared toward community \nwelfare and support activities and other socioeconomic development projects, mainly in Balochistan Province's Naseerabad \nDistrict. The CSR programs also focus on other noteworthy causes in Balochistan and in the rest of Pakistan. The programs \nare governed by a committee comprised of representatives from the local administration and provincial government. The \ncommittee reviews the development requirements of the local communities and selects programs that would most benefit \nthese communities. Uch-II Power is expected to apply the same CSR policies and procedures applied by Uch Power. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1. Community consultations were carried out in the project area through formal and informal meetings, focus group \ndiscussions and in-depth interviews. The company\u2019s socioeconomic team, assisted by environmental specialists, initiated the \nsessions by giving a brief, simple, and nontechnical description of the project, including an overview of all likely positive and \nnegative impacts. This was followed by an open discussion in which all participants were encouraged to voice their concerns \nand opinions. Stakeholder feedback was documented, and all issues and suggestions raised were recorded. Through this \nprocess the consultations reached a wide segment of the population in the project area and actively involved all stakeholders. \nCommunity consultations were carried out included in the villages of Azizabad, Faiq Khan Jamali, Haji Mohammad Ayub \nMangal, Haji Rehmat, Haji Sohbat Khan, Jan Mohammad Jamali, Langha Khan Jamali, Mir Abdul Ghafoor Lari, Soobho Khan \nJatak, and Taj Mohammad Khan Jamali,. They are inhabited by the Jamali, Jakhrani, Khoso, Mengal, Lari, Panhwar, and \nPandrani tribes. Consultations were conducted in the Balochi and Sindhi languages. Three points were raised during the \nseries of consultations: (i) local villagers should be given priority for jobs created by project-related works and activities, (ii) \ncommunity water resources should not be overexploited, and (iii) increased traffic should not jeopardize the safety of the \ncommunities. Addressing these concerns, project-related jobs will be provided to qualified local villagers; community water \nresources will not be exploited (the combined usage of the Uch-I plant and the proposed Uch-II plant is likely to be only about \n42% of the water allocation to the Uch site); and traffic management measures to ensure the safety of local communities have \nbeen included in the project\u2019s environment management plan.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing       Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No    \n \nC&P activities were done in the context of environmental and social assessment, discussed thoroughly in the environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) report, and implemented as appropriate. Most of the consultations took place during the early phase \nof project preparation.

The \nrestrictions on mobility are not very strict; they vary with the marital status and age of women and from tribe to tribe.
