Less than 1% \nof  the  500  main  cities  in  the  PRC  meet  the  air  quality  standards  recommended  by  the  World \nHealth  Organization.1 Although  industrial  emissions  have  stabilized  in  the  past  few  years,  a \nrapid increase in vehicular traffic volumes has created a new threat in the form of vehicle and \nvessel emissions. This factor, as well as the technological developments inspired by successful \ncases  in  Europe,  has  created  renewed  interest  in  the  application  of  both  compressed  natural \ngas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the transport sector, since heavily polluting fuels \nsuch as diesel can be replaced with natural gas, which produces no particulate matter, 25% less \ncarbon dioxide, less than one-third as much nitrogen oxides, and 99% less sulfur dioxide than \nconventional fuel.  \n \n3. \nCNG  is  suitable for  short-distance inner-city  transportation  and,  therefore,  can  be  used \nby  cars,  taxis,  and  buses.  LNG  has  superior  energy  density  and  is  more  appropriate  for  long-\ndistance  transportation,  such  as  long-distance  trucking. 2  Furthermore,  there  is  untapped \npotential for further greening transportation using LNG for inland waterway transport (IWT). The \nPRC  has  the  world\u2019s  largest  IWT  network,  both  in  terms  of  length  and  freight  volume.  Since \n2007,  the  government  has  emphasized  improving  IWT  infrastructure  to  handle  larger  vessels, \nwhich  would allow  for greater transportation efficiency.  LNG  can replace diesel  and bunker  oil \nas an alternative fuel for long-distance IWT vessels. \n\n \n4. \nThe  PRC  per  capita  gas  consumption  is  still  among  the  lowest  of  gas-consuming \ncountries  in  Asia  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  despite  the  fact  that  the  PRC  has  abundant \nundeveloped  natural  gas  reserves,  estimated  at  approximately  3.1  trillion  cubic  meters.3 The \ngovernment  is  actively  trying  to  increase  natural  gas  usage  as  a  part  of  the  PRC\u2019s  overall \nenergy  mix,4 and  specifically  encourages  its  use  in  land  and  water  transportation.5 While  gas \nsupply\u2014both from domestic and international sources\u2014has increased, natural gas demand still \n\n                                                \n1   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2012.

Through  continuous  project  screening  and  discussion  with  private \nsector gas operators, ADB selected CGH as the ideal partner to develop natural gas distribution \ninfrastructure  targeted  at  the  transportation  sector.  CGH  distinguished  itself  from  its  peers  by \nhaving  (i)  greater  geographical  coverage,  including  in  least-developed  rural  areas;  (ii) \nsubstantial technical expertise in small-sized LNG refilling stations; and (iii) a clear strategy for \ngas distribution in IWT. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe proposed project is designed to facilitate the use of natural gas as a transportation \nfuel  by  building  CNG  and  LNG  refueling  stations  along  long-distance  land  transportation \ncorridors and IWT networks in the PRC that cross municipal and provincial boundaries. With the \nproposed facility, CGH plans to build and operate subprojects of 600 CNG and 200 LNG filling \nstations  for  land-based  vehicle  use  and  another  20  LNG  filling  stations  for  IWT  vessel  use \nduring 2015\u20132018.   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\n7. \nCGH, the  borrower  of  the ADB  loan,  is  a  company  incorporated  in Bermuda and listed \non  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange.6 Following  the  government's  2002  policy  to  open  natural \ngas  distribution  to  private  sector  investment,  CGH  has  focused  its  operations  on  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  city  gas  pipelines  and  supply  of  natural  gas  to  residential, \nindustrial,  and  commercial  end  users,  thereby  replacing  coal  and  coal  gas  usage.  In  FY2009, \nCGH  entered  the  liquefied  petroleum  gas  distribution  business  to  become  an  integrated  gas \ndistribution  company.  In  FY2014,  CGH  had  revenues  of  HK$26.0  billion  ($3.4  billion),  a  gross \nprofit of HK$5.3 billion ($682 million), and a net profit of HK$3.0 billion ($384 million). \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \nSince  2006,  ADB  has  been  closely  collaborating  with  CGH  to  address  natural  gas \n8. \ndemand \nInfrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  Phase  1  provided  a  $25  million  equity  investment,  a  $50  million  A-loan, \nand a $75 million B-loan for natural gas distribution to commercial and residential customers in \ncities.7 To meet the government\u2019s urban\u2013rural integration initiative, in 2010 ADB arranged phase \n                                                \n6   Bermuda  is  on  the  \u201cwhite  list\u201d  of  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  jurisdictions,  which \nhave substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard.

Furthermore,  CGH  is  implementing  a  pilot  IWT  LNG  filling  station  along  the \nYangtze River, which has the most river transportation traffic of any PRC inland waterway. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  and  deployment  of  natural  gas  for \n10. \nmultimodal transportation will diversify the energy mix in the PRC by increasing the proportion of \nnatural gas, and increase the availability of natural gas as a transportation fuel in the country.  \n \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  development  of  a  commercially  viable  low-carbon \n11. \ntransport fuel system. The project is expected to generate new jobs and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions while also acting as a catalyst for private sector participation in the sector. \n \nOutput.  The  expected  outputs  include  the  increased  availability  of  CNG  and  LNG \n12. \nstations meeting safeguards  standards. The  project  will  involve the  construction  and  operation \nof  600  CNG  and  200  LNG  refueling  stations  for  use  by  land-based  vehicles  and  20  LNG \nrefueling  stations  for  IWT  vessel  use  during  2015\u20132018,  all  of  which  will  comply  with  ADB \nsafeguard standards and technical eligibility criteria.  \n\n \nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nC. \n\nConsistency  with  midterm  review  of  Strategy  2020.  The  project  is  consistent  with \n13. \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and environment as two \nof the four strategic priorities to sharpen ADB\u2019s operational focus.9 Regarding infrastructure, the \nproject  is  in  line  with  the  midterm  review\u2019s  focus  on  inclusive  growth,  as  well  as  with  its \nemphasis  on  public\u2013private  partnership.  Regarding  the  environment,  the  project  mitigates  air \npollution and health threats, and promotes environmentally sustainable growth. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  country  strategy.  By  supporting  environmental  sustainability,  the \nproject directly addresses key development goals of the PRC country partnership strategy10 and \naligns  with  the  strategy\u2019s  sector  priority  of  pollution  control.  Environmental  sustainability  will \ncontinue to be a major strategic objective of ADB support to the PRC, as will the PRC\u2019s delivery \nof environmental regional and global public goods. The project strongly complements the ADB \nEast  Asia  Department\u2019s  current  initiatives  in  climate  change  mitigation  energy  projects  and \ngreening transport portfolio.  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n8  ADB. 2010.

ADB's Energy \n15. \nPolicy11 requires  energy  operations  to  be  aligned  with  ADB's  overall  strategy  of  emphasizing \nenergy  security,  facilitating  a  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  universal  access  to  energy, \nand  achieving  ADB\u2019s  vision  of  a  region  free  of  poverty.  The  policy  requires  ADB  to  help \ndeveloping  member  countries  provide  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  energy  for  inclusive \ngrowth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. It sets out three pillars \nfor policy implementation: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy; (ii) maximizing \naccess  to  energy  for  all;  and  (iii)  promoting  energy  sector  reform,  capacity  building,  and \ngovernance. The proposed project is in line with the policy, as further penetration of natural gas \nwill  contribute  to  promoting  enhanced  access  to  clean  energy.  It  will  also  demonstrate  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment  to  focusing  future  transport  sector  support  on  the  more  sustainable  forms  of \ntransport,  in  line  with  the  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative. 12  The  project  will  serve  as  a \ndemonstration  of  the  potential  of  natural  gas  for  IWT  use  in  the  PRC  and  in  other  developing \nmember countries with IWT potential. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n16. \nCGH\u2019s land and river transportation sector investment plan indicates a total investment \nof  $1.1  billion  equivalent,  including  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  other  local \nprocurement, and working capital for 2015\u20132018.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n17. \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction \narrangements \n\nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure \nSupply arrangements \nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nArrangements \nThe regulatory requirements for CNG and LNG refilling stations include approvals from \nthe Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission.

The proposed A-loan \nwill have a maturity of up to 10 years from the date of the first disbursement.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nThe complementary loan will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the A-loan, \n20. \nand will be on terms and conditions to be agreed. The complementary loan syndication will be \nundertaken on a best-efforts basis.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nValue-Added by ADB Assistance \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s  support  is  crucial  to  encourage  the  use  of  natural  gas  for  multimodal  transport \nsystems. The use of gas as a transportation fuel offers the opportunity to significantly mitigate \nclimate  change.  This  approach  has  been  successful  in  Europe,  where  major  projects  were \nimplemented to meet the strict emission standards on rivers such as the Rhine. However, LNG \nvehicles  and  vessels  are  new  in  Asia.  ADB\u2019s  support  is  expected  to  highlight  this  untapped \npotential  and  facilitate  development  in  distribution  and  refueling  infrastructure,  the  key \nbottleneck to CNG and LNG utilization. \n \n22. \nBacked by rapidly evolving government policies, significant investments are required to \nrealize  the technical  and  economic  potential  of  natural gas  in the  PRC. Access to finance  has \nbeen  identified  as  one  of  the  key  bottlenecks  to  natural  gas  sector  development.  Commercial \nbanks  are  confronted  with  rapidly  evolving  technologies  and  emerging  contractual  structures \nthat  challenge  the  tolerance  of  their  credit  committees.  A  further  challenge  for  natural  gas \ndistribution  finance  is  the  limited  number  of  project  sponsors  compared  to  other  infrastructure \nareas. Those companies are also undertaking investments in natural gas assets as diverse as \nupstream  development,  long-distance  pipelines,  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas.  The  PRC \ntraditional corporate lending based on balance sheet is not up to the task of funding the required \ninvestment for natural gas distribution infrastructure in new areas, particularly IWT.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \nRisks \n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance  is  designed  to  lower  transaction  costs  by  bundling  technical  clusters \n23. \nalong long-distance transportation corridors, which are often too small and time-consuming for \ninternational banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. The local city commercial banks are less \nactive  in  servicing  project  companies  outside  the  boundaries  of  the  designated  cities.  ADB\u2019s \nvalue  addition  is  to  link  the  cluster  of  projects  with  the  wider  financing  community,  including \ninternational banks, by providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence.  \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n24. \nAdoption risk. CNG and LNG vehicles are more expensive than conventional vehicles.  \nAlso, conversion of conventional engines on existing vehicles to allow for use of CNG and LNG \nrequires up-front investment by vehicle owners. These costs may create barriers to the adoption \nof CNG and LNG as a transportation fuel and result in a lack of demand for CNG and LNG. Due \ndiligence confirmed that the payback period for incremental costs associated with buying CNG \nand LNG vehicles and converting conventional engines to CNG and LNG is less than 2 years. \nFurthermore,  ADB  is  supporting  adaptation  by  enhancing  access  to  finance.13 The  technology \nassociated with the conversion of conventional engines to CNG and LNG is proven and has a \npositive track record. Adoption risk is also expected to be mitigated by government policies and \nincentives that aim to increase natural gas usage in the transportation sector.  \n \n25.  Market  risk.  Though  natural  gas  faces  competition  from  other  conventional  and \nalternative fuels, it is more cost-effective than conventional fuels such as oil and diesel, giving it \na distinct economic advantage. Regarding competition from other alternative fuel technologies, \nelectric vehicles are emerging but are limited to the large cities with high population density in \nthe PRC.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n26. \nRegulatory  risk.  Natural  gas for  long-distance transportation  involves  new  contractual \narrangements. Legal due diligence confirmed CGH\u2019s capacity to obtain all necessary approvals \nas well as the government\u2019s strong policy support for this emerging sector. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n27. \nCompletion  and  operation  risk.  CGH  has  a  proven  technical  and  management  track \nrecord  in  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  natural  gas  distribution  infrastructure, \nincluding CNG and LNG refilling stations servicing land transportation. The risk is also mitigated \nby the homogeneous nature of the subprojects, and the modularized and standardized nature of \nthe stations.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n28. \nForeign  exchange  risk.  This  risk  arises  from  potential  currency  mismatches  between \nthe borrower\u2019s foreign debt service obligation to ADB and local currency receipts of the project. \nThe  dual  currency  feature  of  the  ADB  loan  will  allow  the  borrower  to  draw  in  local  currency, \nthereby mitigating any foreign exchange risk. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \n\n                                                \n13 ADB.  2013.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Clean Bus Leasing Project. Manila. \n\n\f \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n7 \n\n In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \n29. \ncategory B for environment. The potential adverse environmental impacts are site specific and \nmostly  reversible.  CGH\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  will  ensure \ndevelopment  of  quality  initial  environmental  examinations  with  environmental  management \nplans  (EMPs),  and  implementation  of  the  EMPs.  Initial  environmental  examinations  will  be \nprepared for all ADB subprojects. With regard to LNG station sites, only those which avoid any \nadverse impacts on biodiversity will be selected. The land transport CNG and LNG stations will \nhave  no  or  negligible  adverse  impacts  on  biodiversity  as  they  will  be  constructed  adjacent  to \nhighways.  For  climate  change  mitigation,  CGH  implements  boil-off  gas  compressors  in  its \nfacilities  to  recover  any  leaked  natural  gas  and  feeds  into  the  cities\u2019  natural  gas  networks. \nPotential adverse impacts associated with construction will be minimized by the ESMS through \nEMP implementation. Potential adverse environmental impacts of gas refilling station operation \nare associated with accidents. A quality ESMS can minimize the accident risks. \n \n \n30. \nAt  this  stage,  ADB  proceeds  are  not  allocated  for  implementing  specific  subprojects. \nCGH commissioned qualified external experts to conduct a corporate audit of its current ESMS \nand  the  company\u2019s  past  and  current  performance  against  the  objectives,  principles,  and \nrequirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  CGH  will  improve  its  ESMS  to  fully  comply \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement with regard to the project. The improved ESMS will include \n(i)  public  consultation  for  subproject  planning  and  implementation,  (ii)  a  project  screening \nsystem to avoid potential significant adverse environmental impacts, (iii) an initial environmental \nexamination  quality  assurance  system,  (iv)  EMP  implementation  arrangements  of  ADB \nsubproject  subsidiaries,  and  (v)  an  ESMS \nthe \nsubsidiaries to ADB through CGH. ADB will confirm the company\u2019s improved ESMS before the \nfirst disbursement of each tranche. \n\nimplementation  reporting  system  from \n\n \n\n \n31. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  CGH  has  been  developing  an  innovative  LNG  business  model  and \ntechnology  for  long-distance  transportation.  Refilling  station  locations  can  be  flexibly  selected \nand  they  are  commonly  sited  along  main  roads.  The  construction  of  refilling  stations  will  be \nmainly in medium-sized cities. Land acquisition is not expected to be significant and is normally \ncarried  out  by  the  local  governments  before  awarding  of  the  concession.  CGH  will  follow  its \nimproved  ESMS  prior  to  the  disbursement  for  the  first  subproject  of  each  tranche  and  recruit \ncapable  staff  and/or  consultants  to  ensure  that  the  ESMS  is  implemented.  The  ESMS  will \ninclude  resettlement  policy  principles  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  subprojects  using  ADB \nfunds are screened. If the subprojects entail physical and economic displacement, resettlement \nplans will be prepared following national laws of the PRC and in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  requirement  2  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  will  not  have  any \nadverse  impact  on  ethnic  minorities.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the \nproject  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans. \nCGH  has  committed  to  enhance  its  institutional  capacity  to  adequately  manage  the  project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts.   \n\n \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  no  gender  elements. \n32. \nCGH  upholds  gender  equality  and  provides  equal  employment  opportunities  for  men  and \nwomen during project design, construction, and operation. CGH complies strictly with the Law of \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPRC on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women. Jobs to be created by the project will \nbe  offered  to  the  local  labor  force  regardless  of  gender,  and  priority  will  be  given  to  women \nwhere  interest  is  high,  such  as  in  the  financial  and  human  resource  offices.  CGH  will  comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on its compliance (including \nthat  of  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws  and  adherence  to  internationally  recognized  core \nlabor standards.14 Information disclosure and consultations with affected people, as applicable, \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n33. \nCGH was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\n\n34. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n35. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),15 the government\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance will be obtained. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the dollar\u2013yuan \nloan facility of up to $450,000,000 equivalent to China Gas Holdings Limited for the Natural Gas \nfor Land and River Transportation Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China, comprising \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\na  dollar\u2013yuan  A-loan  of  up  to  $150,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources; and \na dollar\u2013yuan complementary loan of up to $300,000,000 equivalent to be funded \nby participating banks,  \n \n\nwith  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n11 November 2014  \n\n                                                \n14   ADB. 2003.
