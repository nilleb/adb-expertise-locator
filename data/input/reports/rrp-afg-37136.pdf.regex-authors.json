In  addition  to  the  lack  of \nmaintenance, the deterioration was further accelerated by the \nheavy damage inflicted by prolonged civil strife and military \noperations. Afghanistan relies significantly on the civil aviation \nsector  for  keeping  most  of  its  remote  communities  within \nreach  of  much  needed  humanitarian  aid  and  basic  public \nservices.  Rehabilitating  and  strengthening  the  civil  aviation \nsector is crucial for extending the reach of the Government in \nKabul, thereby facilitating stabilization and integration of the \ncountry. Rehabilitation of the civil aviation infrastructure is a \nprerequisite  for  private  sector  service  providers  to  provide \nefficient  and  affordable  means  of  transport  to  most  of  the \npopulation living in remote rural provinces. The rehabilitation \nof  the  airports  will  also  help  create  employment,  generate \nincome at the household level, improve safety, improve the \nspread  of  medical  facilities,  help  reconcile  different  ethnic \ngroups,  and  unify  the  country  politically.  To  the  extent \npossible,  the  Project  will  use  labor-intensive  construction \nmethods to provide badly needed employment and income \ngeneration opportunities.  It  will contribute  to social  stability \nand poverty reduction by engaging those internally displaced \nbecause of the war and civil unrest. Thus this investment will \ncontribute significantly to improving the overall socioeconomic \nsituation and mitigating the pervasive poverty.  \n ", "iv       \nIn  the  civil  aviation  sector,  the  Government\u2019s  goal  is  to \nrehabilitate and improve airports and air transport, together \nwith tourism services. This will bring remote areas into the \nmainstream economy and improve linkages with and faster \ntravel to and from the rest of the world and within the country \nbetween  major  cities  and  towns.  It  will  also  facilitate  the \nmovement  of  people,  including  tourists,  for  whom \nAfghanistan\u2019s natural and historical sites should become an \nincreasingly attractive destination, and increase trade in low-\nvolume, high-value goods. With this sectoral goal in place, the \nGovernment\u2019s key priorities for investment in civil aviation are \n(i)  upgrading  Kabul  International  Airport  to  a  fully  fledged \ninternational  airport  that  meets  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization standards; (ii) upgrading Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, \nand  Jalalabad  airports  to  international  standards;  (iii) \nupgrading 15 other major domestic airports; (iv) establishing \nan  appropriate  air  traffic  management  system  that  meets \ninternational standards; (v) constructing hangars and parking \nbays; and (vi) building training and other related facilities.  \n \nTo support the achievement of the Government\u2019s goal in the \ncivil aviation sector, aid agencies coordinated their efforts to \navoid a duplication of assistance and agreed that the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  assistance  for \nrehabilitating domestic and regional airports while the World \nBank  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  will \nsupport  the  upgrading  of  Kabul  International  Airport. \nAccordingly, ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update for \nAfghanistan (2003\u20132005) indicated that ADB assistance in the \ncivil aviation sector would be directed toward the rehabilitation \nof important regional airports to promote the integration of \nremote regions and facilitate more rapid economic growth in \nthose areas. The Country Strategy and Program Update for \nAfghanistan  (2004\u20132006)  includes  the  Regional  Airports \nRehabilitation Project Phase 1 for 2004 in the amount of $30 \nmillion and the Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project Phase \n2 for 2006 in the amount of $40 million.  \n \nObjective  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government \nreconstruct  and  rehabilitate  the  country  by  rehabilitating \nregional airports damaged during two decades of conflict and \nneglect.  \n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $32.1 million equivalent, \nincluding physical contingencies and interest charges during \nconstruction. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $23.7 \nmillion,  representing  about  74%  of  total  costs.  The  local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $8.4 million equivalent, or about \n26% of total costs.  \n \n ", "     v   \nFinancing Plan                   ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange Currency  Cost  % \nADB-ADF   23.7  6.3  30.0  93.5 \nGovernment  0.0  0.1  0.1  0.3 \nUNOPS  0.0  2.0  2.0  6.2 \nTotal  23.7  8.4  32.1  100.0 \n     ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, UNOPS \n= United Nations Office of Project Services. \n    Source: ADB staff. \n     \n    The  United  Nations  Office  of  Project  Services  will  provide \ncofinancing on a parallel basis. \n     \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR20,370,000.  \n($30 million equivalent) will be provided. The loan will have a \n40-year term including a grace period of 10 years, with an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per annum.  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until December 2014. \n \nEstimated Project  \nCompletion Date  30 June 2008. \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT). \n \nImplementation \nArrangements  The Project will be implemented by a project implementation \nunit (PIU) headed by the deputy minister of MCAT as project \ndirector.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  including  the  completion  of \ntraining  programs  and  provision  of  assistance  to \npostconstruction operations. The PIU will consist of a team of \nproject  management  consultants  who  will  undertake  key \nproject management functions and supervise and train MCAT \nstaff  assigned  to  the  unit.  A  project  steering  committee, \nchaired by the minister of MCAT and consisting of the deputy \nminister of the Ministry of Finance and the deputy minister of \nMCAT, will be established to provide the overall guidance and \noversight required for smooth implementation of the Project.  \n \nProcurement  The procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be \nfinanced under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Given the emergency \nnature  of  the  Project,  the  Government  requested  flexible \napplication  of  such  guidelines,  including  a  shorter  bidding \nperiod for international procurement and no prequalification \nexercise. The Government Procurement Unit of Afghanistan \nReconstruction  and  Development  Services  (ARDS)  will \nundertake  all  international  procurement,  including  the \nrecruitment  of  project  management  consultants.  MCAT  will ", "vi       \nexecute  and  administer  the  contracts  in  close  coordination \nwith the Procurement Unit of ARDS.  \n \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required to help MCAT implement \nthe Project. The consulting services will involve (i) carrying out \noverall project management as part of the work of the PIU, (ii) \nproviding assistance with the procurement of civil works, (iii) \nsupervising the construction and installation of equipment, (iv) \ntesting and certifying completed works, (v) implementing and \nsupervising the training component, (vi) providing assistance \nfor  institutional  capacity  building  in  MCAT,  (vii)  providing \nassistance for designing an airport accounting system, (viii) \nproviding  assistance  with  postconstruction  operations  and \nproviding  on-the-job  training  for  airport  operations  and \nmaintenance staff, and (ix) monitoring benefits and carrying \nout evaluation. The consultants will be selected and appointed \nby  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  full \ntechnical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engaging domestic consultants.  \n \nProject Benefits  \nand Beneficiaries  The primary economic benefits of the Project consist of (i)  \nbenefits to operators (direct wear and tear, fuel savings, and \nsafety  benefits);  (ii)  benefits  to  passengers  (direct  time \nsavings and safety benefits); (iii) benefits to the Government \n(direct  revenue  benefits);  and  (iv)  benefits  to  regional  and \nlocal  communities  (indirect  tourist  arrival  benefits).  The \nbenefits to operators are substantial in terms of improvements \nto  aircraft  productivity  resulting from  reduced  downtime  for \nmaintenance; elimination of costs associated with damage to \naircraft  caused  by  flying  stones  from  gravel  runways  (to \nexternal instruments, wing flaps, propeller blades, engines); \nand  lowered  tire  replacement  costs  by  extending  the \noperational life of tires. The Project will severely diminish the \nrisk (and economic costs) of accidents or incidents. Currently \nairstrip incursions are increasingly becoming a safety hazard \nbecause of poor regional airstrip conditions and poor visibility. \n \n  Passengers  benefit  from  improved  arrival  and  departure \nreliability,  savings  on  travel  time,  diminished  risks  of  flight \ncancellation  or  diversion,  and  safety  improvements.  The \ncurrent conditions of uncontrolled airstrips, poor visibility, and \npoor  record  of  on  time  arrivals  and  departures  have  a \nsignificant impact on the confidence of current and potential \ntravelers. The current upward trend in airstrip incursions is \nlikely to result in a catostrophic accident if airstrips are not \nfenced and properly surfaced and if access  is not controlled. \n \n  At the regional and local community levels, the economy can \nbenefit from significant second-round benefits from tourism. ", "     vii   \nAirports will receive foreign and national tourist traffic because \nsome areas have significant potential for attracting tourists.  \n  \nRisks and Assumptions  Implementation of the Project entails a number of risks. First. \nthe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile. \nADB will need to monitor the situation closely and coordinate \nwith local and central authorities and the United Nations to \nensure  adequate  protection  of  ADB  operations.  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  for  the  Security  of  ADB-Financed \nProjects  in  Afghanistan  will  help  provide  a  safe  work \nenvironment  for  on-site  personnel  assigned  by  the \ncontractors,  subcontractors,  and  consulting  firms.  Given \nprevailing  conditions,  however,  this  security  risk cannot be \nmitigated completely, and if security hazards occur in project \nlocations, delays in project implementation will be inevitable \ndespite any measures put in place to control this risk. Second, \nthe regional warlords maintain their military strength and their \ninfluence  in  regional  politics.  This  political  instability  could \nhamper the smooth supply of raw materials and equipment, \nwhich would need to be transported through areas controlled \nby  regional  warlords,  and  constrain  the  supervision  of \nconstruction works by consultants and ADB staff. Third, the \nrehabilitated  regional  airports  could  be  used  to  transport \nopium.  While  security  checks  in  regional  airports  will  be \nstrengthened,  the  distribution  of  opium  through  the \nrehabilitated airports cannot be completely contained unless \nopium  cultivation  is  eradicated.  Fourth,  the  Government\u2019s \nimplementation capacity is weak, which may result in undue \ndelays  in  implementing  key  activities.  Also  the  lack  of \naccounting and auditing capacity implies a risk of corruption. \nThus resources will be allocated for consultancy services to \nassist with project management and implementation. Fifth, the \nPIU will consist of a team of consultants and MCAT staff and \nbe headed by the deputy minister of MCAT. Because of the \nlack of capacity of MCAT staff, the consultant team will carry \nout  substantial  works  and  make  key  decisions.  Lack  of \ncoordination between the project director and the consultant \nteam  may  cause  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB\u2019s \nResident  Mission  in  Afghanistan  will  play  a  key  role  in \nfacilitating  close  coordination  to  prevent  any  stalemates  in \nimplementation. Sixth, the progress of project implementation \nmay be disrupted by poorly qualified MCAT staff assigned to \nthe PIU. The consultant team will be involved in selecting staff \nto be assigned to the PIU and will provide continuous training \nfor  them  once  they  have  been  selected  and  assigned. \nSeventh, the Procurement Unit of ARDS, a dedicated agency \nfor  dealing  with  planning,  coordination,  preparation,  and \nprocurement for major reconstruction projects, will handle all \nprocurement  related  to  the  Project.  A  lack  of  close \ncoordination between the PIU and the Procurement Unit of \nARDS will cause delays in procurement.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project Phase 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Civil Aviation Infrastructure \n \n2.  Afghanistan is a landlocked country. Its population, estimated at 26 million, is spread \nover some 652,000 square kilometers of mostly mountainous terrain. Apart from Kabul, the \ncapital, and a few provincial capitals such as Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan \nhas few population centers. With the rugged Hindu Kush mountains occupying the geographical \ncenter of the country, the population centers are physically separated by steep mountains or by \ndesert. In the absence of a railway system and functioning river ports, Afghanistan depends \nsolely on road and air transport for the movement of passengers and goods. Since the end of \nthe conflict, the country has made massive efforts to rehabilitate its 3,300-kilometer primary \nroad network, which consists of a ring road that connects Kabul to major population centers and \ninternational  links  to  neighboring  countries.  While  the  road  network  will  offer  reliable  links \ncapable  of  transporting  large  volumes  of  goods  and  people  when  rehabilitation  has  been \ncompleted, air transport will continue to offer the best, and often the only, quick link between \nremote  provinces  and  Kabul.  Because  of  its  strategic  geographic  location,  Afghanistan\u2019s \nairspace offers one of the shortest routes between Asia and Europe, thus keeping Afghanistan\u2019s \nairspace open to international overflights broadly benefits both the international community and \nthe country. \n \n3.  Afghanistan has two major air gateways: Kabul International Airport serving the capital \nand Kandahar International Airport serving the south of the country. In the past, both airports \nwere operated under instrument flight rules with day and night operations. Four major domestic \nairports (at Herat, Jalalabad, Kunduz, and Mazar-e-Sharif) provide air connections to the major \ncities. In addition, 16 regional domestic airports are spread across the country to serve smaller, \nmore remote areas. These airports have mainly graveled airside facilities and operate under \nvisual flight rules. \n \n4.  The prolonged conflict in Afghanistan has resulted in large-scale deterioration of the civil \naviation infrastructure and depletion of skilled human resources. In addition to the lack of \nmaintenance, the heavy damage inflicted during the decades of civil strife and the recent \nmilitary  operations  accelerated  the  deterioration.  Paved  runways,  taxiways,  and  aprons, \noriginally constructed to a high standard, are showing signs of severe ageing, embrittlement, \nand loss of bitumen, plus bomb craters and similar damage at a number of locations. Existing \nasphalt pavements will need asphalt overlays to restore proper longitudinal, cross\u2013sectional, \nand  surface  texture.  Terminal  buildings  are in  poor  condition,  with few  amenities  such  as \nbaggage handling facilities, restaurants, modern heating, lighting, toilets, or plumbing. Airport \nrescue and fire services are also in a poor state, with little equipment and limited mobility. \nExisting security arrangements are lax and trespassing by unauthorized persons and straying \nby animals onto airport property are common. Control tower operations and communications fall \nfar short of minimum international standards. Organized, regular airport maintenance activities \nare currently nonexistent. Airport plans and surveys are not available and none of the airports ", "2      \nhas a master plan. The current state of civil aviation calls for a significant initiative to put the \nsector on par with international standards. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Sector Management \n \n5.  The Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT) is responsible for operating and \nmaintaining the country\u2019s 22 airports. MCAT also owns the national airline (Ariana Afghan \nAirlines)  and  major  hotels  and  is  responsible  for  promoting  tourism  and  providing  related \nservices. MCAT is divided into eight presidencies, and currently has about 1,200 staff. Because \nof the deteriorated infrastructure and the depletion of trained staff, MCAT is unable to provide \nadequate  air  traffic  control  for  Afghanistan\u2019s  airspace.  Given  existing  controllers;  technical \nsupport staff; and communications, surveillance, and navigation systems, assuring the safety of \nflights over Afghanistan is impossible. Immediate action has to be taken to rehabilitate and \nimprove MCAT\u2019s institutional capacity to operate and maintain the country\u2019s airports. \n \n6.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  was  responsible  for  airport  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance. While MCAT currently continues to be responsible for airport management at all \nairports and air traffic control at certain large domestic airports, the role of the Ministry of Public \nWorks has been defunct for many years. As a result, little airport maintenance work has been \ncarried out since 1989. MCAT currently has no capability for carrying out either day-to-day or \nmajor periodic airport maintenance, but intends to take over the airport design, construction, and \nmaintenance role in the future. \n \n7.  MCAT carries out regulatory functions on the basis of the Civil Aviation Act of July 2003. \nHowever, the act is seriously deficient in that it does not provide MCAT with the powers and \nauthority to regulate civil aviation, such as the authority to issue the kinds of regulations, orders, \nand directives necessary to ensure the safety of aviation. The reestablishment of a regulatory \nsystem and of the capability to oversee safety is urgently needed to ensure the safety of air \noperations and the commercial success of Ariana Afghan Airlines. In the future, the regulatory \nframework will be based on a new civil aviation act that will enable the establishment of a civil \naviation authority to act as a regulator instead of MCAT \n \n3.  Air Transport Services \n \n8.  Prior to 1989, air travel was a well-developed mode of transport in Afghanistan, popular \nwith tourists and Afghan business people, Government officials, and other users who could \nafford to fly. The national airline, Ariana Afghan Airlines, was established in 1955 and has \ncontinued to operate, despite the adverse circumstances of the last two decades. At its peak in \nthe late 1970s, Ariana\u2019s fleet regularly flew to major Western European cities as well as to \nneighboring countries. During the last decade, however, Ariana lost most of its international \nroutes mainly because of the conflict within the country and international sanctions imposed \nagainst the previous regime. It also lost most of its fleet and trained personnel.  \n \n9.  Since the end of the conflict, Ariana has been expanding its international reach. It \ncurrently owns seven aircraft and operates international flights to 13 destinations to as far away \nas Germany. However, the old age of its fleet, the shortage of properly trained personnel, the \npoorly equipped maintenance facilities, and the lack of proper oversight functions in MCAT have \ncontributed to concerns about the safety and reliability of Ariana\u2019s fleet operations. In addition to \nAriana, foreign airlines from nearby countries have started services to Afghanistan and Afghan \nairspace is rapidly opening up to international flights.  \n ", "     3   \n10.  Ariana currently provides limited services on domestic routes. United Nations agencies \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs) started a network of domestic services immediately \nfollowing  the  commencement  of  international  assistance  to  Afghanistan  in  2002.  These \nservices, operated by United Nations Humanitarian Air Services, the United Nations Assistance \nMission to Afghanistan, and Partners in Aviation Communications and Technology chiefly cater \nto United Nations and NGO personnel. Kam Air, a start-up commercial airline licensed in \nNovember 2003, operates both international and domestic services and its domestic network \ncurrently serves six to eight airports. A large, untapped demand for air service appears to exist \nthat can only be met by developing new commercial air services. Such development must be \nunderpinned by the rehabilitation of airports and supporting infrastructure.  \n \n11.  Appendix 2 presents an analysis of the civil aviation sector in Afghanistan.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Transport Sector Review  \n \n12.  The  Transport  Sector  Review  (TSR),  prepared  with  assistance  from  the  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \ncomprehensively  assessed  the  entire  transport  sector  in  Afghanistan  and  made  policy \nrecommendations.  Recommendations  pertinent  to  civil  aviation  concerned  (i)  policy  on \ninternational and domestic routes, (ii) creation of a proper licensing system, (iii) relationship \nbetween Ariana and the Government, (iv) airport infrastructure and its operation,  (v) air traffic \nmanagement,  (vi)  regulation  of  aviation  safety,  and  (vii)  cross-cutting  themes  such  as  the \nenvironment and subsidies for domestic routes to support the provision of basic public services.  \n \n13.  The TSR identified weaknesses in the current organization of MCAT and proposed \nreorganizing it in such a way that (i) Ariana will be run without Government involvement in \ncommercial or operational matters, but the Government\u2019s powers need to be clearly defined; (ii) \napplications for licenses and the assessment and allocation of tenders to run noncommercial \ndomestic services will be handled by a separate licensing division that will be created to handle \nthese matters; (iii) MCAT will take over responsibility for capital works for airport infrastructure \nfrom the Ministry of Public Works, a function that will ultimately be separated from MCAT and be \nestablished as a corporate structure, analogous to Ariana, to operate airports; (iv) air traffic \nmanagement operations, once modernized, will be transferred to an independent agency or to a \nseparate corporate entity; and (v) safety regulation, once restored, will be assigned to an \norganization separate from the central Government.  \n  \n2.  Government Strategy for Sector Development \n \n14.  The Government\u2019s vision for developing the transport sector is to restore or create basic \ntransport infrastructure facilities, including roads and airports, to allow better operation of public \nand  private  transport  services  in  all  areas  of  the  country  and  international  linkages.  The \nobjectives are to facilitate economic development by improving access to markets and reducing \npoverty and promoting national and regional integration, development, and security. In the civil \naviation sector, the Government\u2019s goal is to rehabilitate and improve airports and air transport, \ntogether with tourism services. This will bring remote areas into the mainstream economy and \npermit improved linkages with and faster travel to and from the rest of the world and within the \ncountry between major cities and towns. It will also facilitate the movement of people, including \ntourists, for whom Afghanistan\u2019s natural and historical sites should become an increasingly \nattractive destination, and increase trade in low-volume, high-value goods. On this basis, the ", "4      \nGovernment decided to rehabilitate regional airports with ADB assistance. Pending completion \nof the Civil Aviation Master Plan  by 2004, the Government selected seven regional airports to \nbe covered by the Project in 2004 given the need to provide access to air transport services to \nremote areas with poor access by road and to balance regional development. The Government \nintends to rehabilitate the remaining regional airports by means of the ADB  Regional Airports \nRehabilitation Project Phase 2, scheduled for 2006. \n \n15.  The Government envisages reorganizing MCAT to focus its role on (i) formulating policy \nand strategy, (ii) carrying out planning and budgeting tasks, and (iii) creating and maintaining \ndatabases. The Government is considering restructuring the board of Ariana Afghan Airlines \nand placing it directly under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). It will soon reconstitute the board \nand  work  toward  privatizing  the  airline.  The  Government  is  also  considering  corporatizing \nairports, in which case the airports will be operationally self-financing. It will establish a separate, \nself-financing,  corporate  entity  to  operate  the  air  navigation  system  at  airports.  Legislation \nestablishing airport and air navigation system corporations will enable facilities and services to \nbe privately financed and operated as concessions. A system for economic regulation of the \nairports and air navigation system consisting primarily of self-regulatory arrangements will have \nbeen established.  \n \n16.  Supplementary Appendix A provides the Government\u2019s policy statement for the transport \nsector,  which  sets  out  the  principles  guiding  the  transport  sector  reforms  and  provides  a \nframework for reform implementation. \n \n3.  External Assistance and Aid Coordination \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance (TA) Cluster for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment,1 approved in 2002, allocated $500,000 for capacity building in MCAT. MCAT sent \n27 of its staff to the Civil Aviation Training College in Allahabad, India, for training in area \ncontrol. The World Bank, as part of its Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project approved in \n2003,  has  provided  $19.3  million  to  rehabilitate  Kabul  International  Airport,  including  the \nrunways, the permanent runway lighting system, and the power distribution system, and to \npurchase equipment for communication and radio navigation aids, runway operations, mobile \nlighting  for  fire  fighting,  ground  handling,  and  airfield  operations.  The  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency will provide assistance to construct a new passenger terminal building at \nKabul International Airport.  \n \n18.  Within the Government, MOF plays the key role in coordinating external assistance. The \nGovernment has undertaken three initiatives to improve aid coordination. First, external funding \nagencies have been asked to focus on three specific sectors. Second, the Government has \nestablished consultative groups of aid agency and Government representatives at the local level \ncovering 12 national development programs and 4 cross-cutting advisory groups for gender \nissues, the environment, humanitarian affairs, and human rights, with one external agency \ndesignated as the focal point. Third, the funding agency-Government forum moved from an \nimplementation framework to a Government-led consultative process. ADB is the focal point for \ntransport, natural resource management, and the environment. ADB is assessing whether to \nestablish  a  secretariat  for  the  consultative  group  on  transport  to  facilitate  policy-level \ndiscussions and provide guidance on generic issues related to project implementation. ADB \nstaff are actively engaged in the proceedings of the consultative groups and the components of \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance Cluster to Afghanistan for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development. \nManila.  ", "     5   \nthe proposed Project were developed in close consultation with other external funding agencies \nat the consultative group meetings. \n \n4.  ADB Strategy \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Initial Country Strategy and Program for Afghanistan (2002\u20132004) identified the \nfollowing four principles for ADB\u2019s medium-term development framework. First, Afghan men and \nwomen must be fully involved in all stages of the reconstruction process from planning to design \nand implementation and the Government must fully own and drive the reconstruction process. \nThe  social  exclusion  of  Afghan  women,  in  particular,  should  end  with  their  return  to  the \nsocioeconomic mainstream. Second, an appropriate policy and institutional framework must be \nin  place  to  support  investment  in  reconstruction,  which  also  requires  sound  governance. \nTransparency,  accountability,  participation,  and  the  rule  of  law  provide  the  basis  of  good \ngovernance, which must be established at all levels from the central level to community and \nlocal  levels.  Third,  substantial  institutional  capacity  building  is  needed  to  ensure  the \neffectiveness of the reconstruction and development process. This will require solid partnerships \nwith other aid agencies, NGOs, and community-based organizations. Fourth, investments in \nreconstruction must promote human rights and social inclusion and respond to the needs of \nreturning refugees, internally displaced people, and the vulnerable and disabled.  \n \n20.  In relation to the rehabilitation of physical infrastructure, the Initial Country Strategy and \nProgram  emphasized  that  physical  infrastructure  constraints,  which  arose  because  of  the \ninhospitable environment, hostilities, and disrepair of facilities, should be removed to revive \nnormal economic activities. The Initial Country Strategy and Program identified those physical \nconstraints requiring priority attention as (i) agricultural land and irrigation facilities inaccessible \nbecause of mines and unexploded ordnance or irrigation systems in disrepair; (ii) economic and \nsocial infrastructure destroyed or degraded; and (iii) other infrastructure destroyed, degraded, or \ninadequately exploited. Infrastructure rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development and mine \nclearing are to address these constraints.  \n \n21.  With this strategy in place, the Country Strategy and Program Update for Afghanistan \n(2003\u20132005) indicated that ADB assistance in the civil aviation sector would be directed toward \nthe rehabilitation of important regional airports to promote the integration of remote regions and \nfacilitate  more  rapid  economic  growth  in  those  areas.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program \nUpdate  for  Afghanistan  (2004\u20132006)  includes  the  Regional  Airports  Rehabilitation  Project \nPhase 1 for 2004 in the amount of $30 million and the Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project \nPhase 2 for 2006 in the amount of $40 million to rehabilitate regional airports other than Kabul \nand Kandahar airports. It also includes TA for institutional strengthening of MCAT in 2005 in the \namount of $1 million. In addition, ADB is financing preparation of the Civil Aviation Master Plan.  \n \n5.  Institutional Capacity Building \n \n22.  As proposed by the TSR, the long-term goal of MCAT\u2019s reorganization is to (i) run Ariana \nwithout Government involvement in commercial or operational matters, (ii) create a separate \nlicensing division to handle license applications, (iii) corporatize airport operation, (iv) create a \nseparate agency for operating the air traffic management system, and (v) assign the safety \nregulation system to an organization separate from the central Government. These goals will be \npursued during a 10-year period as proposed by the TRS; however, in the short and medium \nterm,  MCAT  should  restructure  its  organization  and  strengthen  its  capacity  to  support  the \nachievement  of  its  long-term  goals.  The  TSR  proposes  restructuring  the  current  eight \npresidencies into the following four functional departments: (i) the Airports Department, (ii) the ", "6      \nFlight Safety and Licensing Department, (iii) the Administration Department, and (iv) the Air \nNavigation Services Department.  \n \n23.  The restructuring and capacity building of MCAT will be implemented in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR)  scheme in a phased manner.2 The \nrestructuring of MCAT will be carried out in four phases by creating the four new departments \n(in the same order as listed in para. 22). To facilitate the restructuring and capacity building \nprocesses, a separate capacity building unit will be established in MCAT within the ambit of the \nPRR scheme, and ADB will support the processes of obtaining PRR status for the unit. Kabul \nInternational Airport, currently a separate MCAT department, has obtained PRR-S status with \ntechnical support from the World Bank. \n \n24.  The  restructuring  and  capacity  building  will  not  be  undertaken  within  the  existing \norganization. An embryonic new organization will be set up within the capacity building unit, \nwhich will serve as an incubator. This new organization will have a skeleton staff to be recruited \nfrom  among  qualified  local  or  overseas  Afghan  professionals.  The  human  resources \ndevelopment program to be provided by the Project will be used to strengthen the capacity of \nthese core staff. Once the new departmental setup has been finalized, the application for PRR \nstatus will be obtained to have it established as a complete department. Then staff in the old \ndepartment will be transferred to the new one. The project management consultants to be \nengaged by the Project will help MCAT implement this restructuring and capacity building \ninitiative, particularly the application for PRR status for new departments.  \n \n25.  A fair financial and budget accounting system is a prerequisite for efficient planning of \nairport  operations  and  investments.  MCAT\u2019s  current  accounting  system  is  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  accounting  system  and  is  maintained  on  a  cash  basis.  Under  this  system, \nascertaining the true value of airport assets and the financial situation of airport operations and \nservices is difficult. MCAT does not have accurate information about actual expenditures and \nrevenues in relation to civil aviation operations. As a result, the governance and accountability \nof airport operations are threatened and MCAT\u2019s capacity for long-term planning for the civil \naviation  sector  cannot  be  improved.  MCAT  should  develop  its  capacity  to  maintain  its \naccounting  records  in  accordance  with  commercial  accounting  standards  as  well  as    with  \nGovernment accounting rules. Redesigning and upgrading MCAT\u2019s accounting system is an \nurgent component of capacity building in MCAT.  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s TA for Capacity Building for MCAT programmed for 2005 will support the redesig \nand  upgrading  of  MCAT\u2019s  accounting  system.  In  the  short  term,  the  project  management \nconsultants to be engaged by the Project and to be fielded around March 2005 will set up the \naccounting system for project implementation and airport operations. MCAT staff will be trained \nin  the  new  accounting  system  for  airport  operations  under  the  Project\u2019s  scheme  for \npostconstruction operations assistance. \n \n27.  Some  key  milestones  of  the  restructuring  and  capacity  building  of  MCAT  will  be \nimplemented in line with the following time frame: (i) MCAT will establish the capacity building \nunit, obtain PRR status (stage 1) by the end of February 2005, and submit the application (stage \n2) for its PRR status by the end of March 2005; (ii) MCAT will submit the application (stage 2) \n                                                 \n2  The intent of the PRR scheme is to promote the reform and restructuring of ministries and Government agencies. \nMinistries and Government agencies can apply for PRR status in two stages by submitting preliminary institutional \nreform plans for stage 1 and by submitting detailed action plans to implement the reforms for stage 2. Once they \nhave obtained PRR status, employees who fill new posts under the restructured organization are compensated \nwith additional salary in the form of an interim additional allowance. ", "     7   \nfor its PRR status for the Technical, Operations, and Meteorology Department by the end of \nMarch 2005 on the basis of the PRR status (stage 1) already obtained; and (iii) MCAT will start \npreliminary analysis of the existing accounting system by the end of May 2005 and start detailed \nredesigning and upgrading of its accounting system by the end of November 2005 with ADB \nassistance.  ADB\u2019s  loan  for  the  Project  will  be  disbursed  only  when  MCAT  has  achieved \nmilestones (i) and (ii).  \n \n6.  Security Situation \n \n28.  Security  is  the  main  issue  and  constraint  in  relation  to  reconstruction.  Without  an \nadequate level of security, the country will fail to achieve key national goals for economic \ngrowth, political normalization and national reconciliation, and social development. Afghanistan \nhas made significant gains in security in the last 2 years that have laid a solid foundation for \ncontinued and accelerated reform and has avoided a resurgence of major civil conflict. Sporadic \noutbreaks  of  armed  conflict,  even  if  not  always  fully  resolved,  have  been  contained  and \nprevented  from  spreading.  The  internationally  sponsored  security  arrangements  for  Kabul, \nbased  on  the  international  security  assistance  forces  working  in  cooperation  with  Afghan \nsecurity forces, have worked reasonably well. Some improvements have been made in the \npolice force, and the first units of a national army have been formed and trained. Security on the \nmain intercity roads has improved significantly compared with the situation 2 years ago.  \n \n29.  Nevertheless, the security situation has deteriorated in parts of the country, particularly \nin rural areas. Opium poppy cultivation, which had been sharply reduced during 2000, and \nespecially in 2001, made a strong comeback in 2002, and cultivation expanded further during \nthe 2003 season. Narcotics production and trade and the profits from these activities constitute \na major threat to Afghanistan\u2019s security, political normalization, and economic development. \nContainment and eradication of illicit drug production will inevitably be a long-term effort that \nrequires a combination of effective law enforcement and rural development that generates \nalternative livelihoods. \n \n30.  The disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program to reduce the number and \nsize  of  private  militias  and  undercut  the  military  strength  of  the  regional  governors  has \nprogressed  slowly.  A  number  of  local  militias  have  resisted,  claiming  that  the  Ministry  of \nDefense was monopolized by a particular ethnic group. Even though the Government replaced \na number of senior ministry officials belonging to this ethnic group with officials belonging to \nother ethnic groups in September 2003, some concerns linger about the loyalty of lower-ranking \nministry officials. This situation enables regional warlords to maintain their military strength and \ncontinue to influence regional politics, which has not helped the security situation. The security \nsituation will continue to constrain the progress of reconstruction, and concerns about security \nmay continue to discourage foreign and large-scale domestic investment. \n \n31.  This fragile security situation will adversely affect the implementation of the Project \nbecause (i) the security hazard around project locations will disrupt and delay construction work; \n(ii) the supply of raw materials, which will have to be transported through areas controlled by \nregional  warlords,  may  be  hampered;  and  (iii)  the  supervision  of  construction  work  by \nconsultants and ADB staff may be constrained. To overcome these problems, the Project will \nmake use of the arrangements devised by ADB\u2019s TA for the Security of ADB-Financed Project \nin Afghanistan,3 which will help provide a safe work environment for on-site personnel assigned \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004.

", "8      \nby the contractors, subcontractors, and consulting firms, and will coordinate closely with the \nsecurity adviser engaged by ADB especially for cooperation with provincial authorities.  \n \n7.  Opium-Related Problems \n \n32.  Afghanistan is the world\u2019s largest producer of illicit opium. The current ban on cultivation \nhas had an extremely limited effect, and opium is a major source of cash income for farmers \nbecause of its ready profitability and because of a lack of other livelihood alternatives. According \nto the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), opium was cultivated on 80,000 \nhectares  in 2003, an increase of 8% over 2002, and production increased by 6% to 3,968 tons, \n20 times more than in 2001, the last year of Taliban rule. Farmers grew poppies in 28 of the \ncountry\u2019s 32 provinces in 2003, up from 18 in 1999. UNODC estimates that 264,000 families, or \nabout 7% of Afghanistan\u2019s population, are producing poppies, each cultivating an average of 0.3 \nhectares. UNODC estimates average yearly earnings at $3,900 per opium-growing family, or \n$594 per capita, in a country where per capita gross domestic product is only $207. The share \nof poppy production in the economy is large. If opium exports were included, total exports would \nbe 40% greater.  \n \n33.  Poppy  cultivation  and  narcotics  production  and  trade  constitute  a  major  threat  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s security and political normalization and tie a poor rural population to regional \nwarlords and international crime syndicates. To combat this problem, the Government has \ndeveloped a national counternarcotics strategy and is working with aid agencies involved in the \nsecurity  sector  on  containing  and  eradicating  poppy  cultivation  and  providing  support  for \nalternative livelihoods. ADB support focuses on helping farm households develop livelihood \nalternatives to poppy cultivation. ADB activities in this regard include creating an enabling \nenvironment  for  the  commercialization  and  diversification  of  agricultural  production  and \nrehabilitating irrigation systems, which ADB is pursuing through a demand-driven, participatory, \nand  community-based  approach.  ADB  is  also  supporting  measures  to  contain  the  flow  of \nnarcotics across borders through some of its subregional activities, including building capacity \nand strengthening customs and immigration departments in the region.  \n \n8.  Lessons Learned \n \n34.  A number of lessons can be drawn from past emergency assistance projects, best \npractices, and ADB\u2019s initial lending and nonlending operations in Afghanistan since 2002. First, \ncontinued emphasis has to be given to capacity building to improve planning, project design and \nimplementation, administration, and financial management. Second, aid coordination by means \nof consultative groups is important for avoiding duplication and delays. Third, aid groups must \nwork closely with a country\u2019s MOF and central bank to develop a viable and working payment \nsystem,  without  which  maintaining  a  flow  of  funds  is  difficult.  Fourth,  capacity  building  in \nexecuting  agencies  is vital,  and  consulting  services  for  project  design  and  implementation \nshould provide for the training of executing agency staff in the operations and maintenance of \nrehabilitated facilities. Fifth, the number of procurement packages should be minimized, given \nthe limited implementation capacity of executing agencies. Sixth, ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines \nshould be applied flexibly for emergency assistance projects to allow reduced procurement \nperiods  for  the  urgent  delivery  of  project  components.  Seventh,  law  and  order  situations \nresulting from conflict hamper the smooth implementation of projects and extensive security \nplans should be put in place to address possible security hazards in project locations. All these \nlessons have been incorporated into the design of the Project.  \n \n ", "     9   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n35.  The objective of the Project is to help the Government with the reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of the country by rehabilitating regional airports damaged during two decades of \nconflict and neglect. While the Project focuses on rehabilitating key airport infrastructure, related \npolicy and institutional reforms in the transport sector are reflected in the on-going Postconflict \nMultisector Program Loan.4   \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Rehabilitation of Regional Airports  \n \n36.  The Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project included in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram Update for Afghanistan (2004\u20132006) will provide rehabilitation support for domestic \nand regional airports in two phases: $30 million in 2004 for phase 1 and $40 million in 2006 for \nphase  2.  The  Project  covers  the  rehabilitation  of  seven  airports:    Bamyan,  Chaghcharan, \nFaizabad,  Farah,  Maimana,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj.  Major  rehabilitation  work  includes  the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  reconstructing runways and stopways; building new taxiway and apron; \n(ii)  constructing, widening, or regrading runway strip; \n(iii)  building new passenger terminal or renovating existing one, including providing \nfurniture; \n(iv)  providing water supply, sewerage, and power supply system; \n(v)  reconstructing access roads and car parks; \n(vi)  providing  airport  maintenance  plant,  equipment,  and  airport  maintenance \nbuilding; \n(vii)  constructing airport boundary fence and apron security fencing and gates; \n(viii)  providing new fire station, control tower, technical building including furniture, and \nwarehouse including temperature-controlled storage facilities;5 \n(ix)  providing staff housing; \n(x)  providing automatic weather observation system and precision approach path \nindicator; and \n(xi)  providing de-mining support. \n \n37.  The civil works contracts are packaged as design-build. Appendix 3 summarizes the \ndetailed design standards for runways and required equipment for each airport.  \n \n2.  Human Resource Development \n \n38.  The Project will provide two human resource development packages for current MCAT \nstaff and new recruitments to strengthen their capacity for sector management and airport \n                                                 \n4  Policy objectives in the transport sector include (i) creating an enabling framework for market-based competition \nand efficiency, (ii) establishing safe and reliable transport services, (iii) improving institutional efficiency, (iv) \nestablishing a regulatory framework, (v) improving transparency and accountability, (vi) instituting a mechanism for \ncost recovery, (vii) encouraging private sector participation, and (viii) establishing a national system for road \nimprovement and maintenance.  \n5  Temperature-controlled storage facilities will be leased out to a private sector operator for sustainable operations \nand maintenance. ", "10      \noperations and maintenance. The first package will strengthen the training capacity of the Civil \nAviation  Training  Center  operated  by  MCAT.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for  course \ndevelopment and engagement of instructors and in a 2-year period will produce about 180 \ngraduates in a range of disciplines, such as airport management, airport inspection, airport \nmaintenance, airport engineering, airside operations and management, flight safety, airport \nsecurity checks for opium smuggling, and aviation security.  \n \n39.  The  second  package  will  provide  an  overseas  training  program  for  MCAT  staff  for \nadvanced training. ADB\u2019s TA Cluster for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development \n(footnote 1), approved in 2002, provided assistance for MCAT to train 27 of its staff in air traffic \ncontrol. This package will extend the on-going overseas training program by expanding the \ncourses  to  cover  such  critical  subjects  as  airport  management,  flight  safety,  and  aviation \nsecurity and increasing the number of trainees to about 50. The Regional Airport Rehabilitation \nProject Phase 2, programmed for 2006, will continue supporting human resource development \nso as to build adequate capacity over the long term. \n \n3.  Postconstruction Operations Assistance \n \n40.   MCAT will face a major challenge in operating and maintaining the airports that will \nhave been rehabilitated by the Project, because adequate human resources to manage the \nairports  appropriately  are  not  available.  The  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  engage  a \npostconstruction  operations  assistance  team  that  will  consist  of  an  airport \nmanagement/operations  specialist,  an  airport  maintenance  specialist,  and  an  airport  fire \nservices specialist for 1 year following the completion of rehabilitation. The team will be placed \nin MCAT and form the nucleus of an airport operations and maintenance division. The team will \ninclude the graduates from  the Civil Aviation Training Center and the trainees who have \nreturned from training overseas, and the specialists engaged will provide on-the-job training for \nthem until their technical competence is sufficient for them to take over the responsibility of \nairport operations and maintenance. \n \n4.  Project Management and Monitoring \n \n41.  A consultant team will be hired to help MCAT implement the Project. Team members will \noccupy key posts in the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to be established under MCAT, with \nthe team leader serving as project manager. The consultant team will be responsible for (i) \noverseeing overall project management; (ii) assisting with the procurement of civil works; (iii) \nsupervising construction and installation of equipment, including reviewing detailed designs \nprepared by contractors; (iv) testing and certifying completed works; (v) implementing and \nsupervising the training component of the Project; (vi) providing assistance for institutional \ncapacity building in MCAT; (vii) assisting with postconstruction operations and providing on-the-\njob  training  for  airport  operations  and  maintenance  staff;  and  (viii)  undertaking  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \n5.  Administrative Support \n \n42.  The Project will finance the engagement of external auditors to audit project accounts \nand the payment of additional salary to MCAT staff assigned to the PIU.  \n ", "    1 1   \nC.

In view of the extraordinary challenges inherent in coping with the postconflict situation, \nAfghanistan  has  requested  enhanced  concessionality  in  ADB\u2019s  funding  the  transition  and \nreconstruction phase. The request is supported by a recent analysis of debt sustainability by \nADB  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  which  concludes  that  funding  for  development \nprojects should be on a grant basis or on highly concessional terms for key projects and reforms \nfor which no grant funding can be mobilized. Accordingly, special lending terms are proposed as \nfollows: (i) grandfathering pre-1999 Asian Development Fund (ADF) lending terms so that the \nloan  has  a  40-year  maturity,  including  a  10-year  grace  period,  with  a  1%  interest  charge \nthroughout its term; and (ii) capitalizing interest during the grace period. These special lending \nterms have been applied to other projects approved for Afghanistan since lending operations \nresumed in late 2002. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n44.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $32.1  million  equivalent,  including  physical \ncontingencies and interest charges during construction. The foreign exchange cost is estimated \nat $23.7 million, representing about 74% of total costs. The local currency cost is estimated at \n$8.4 million equivalent, or about 26% of total costs. The local currency costs include $0.2 million \nequivalent  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  provided  in \nAppendix 4.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n45.  The proposed ADB loan is $30 million equivalent from Special Funds (ADF) resources \ndenominated in special drawing rights. The ADB loan will finance 100% of the foreign exchange \ncosts of the Project and 76% of the local currency costs. The total ADB financing will cover \n93.5% of the total project costs. The United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS) will \nprovide parallel cofinancing of $2 million equivalent for the Project, or 6.2% of total project costs, \nwhich will be used to finance renovation of terminal buildings, water supply systems, and \nboundary fencing. The Government will finance the land acquisition cost of $0.1 million, or 0.3% \nof total project costs. If UNOPS cofinancing does not materialize, financing to cover the UNOPS \ncomponent  will  be  considered  through  alternative  sources  (including from  ADB,  subject  to \napproval of its Board). \n \n46.  The borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The borrower will make the \nloan available for the Project\u2019s executing agency through appropriate budgetary allocation.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \na.  Project Steering Committee \n \n47.  MCAT will be the executing agency for the Project. A project steering committee (PSC), \nchaired by the minister of MCAT,  will be established to provide the overall guidance and \noversight required for smooth implementation of the Project. The PSC will consist of the deputy \nministers of MOF and MCAT and will meet at least quarterly to review project implementation \nand to resolve procurement and other issues. If necessary, the PSC will be supported by ", "12      \nexternal experts financed by the Project to help resolve sector-specific technical issues. The \nimplementation arrangements are shown in Appendix 5. \n \nb.  Project Implementation Unit \n \n48.  The PIU will be established in MCAT, will be headed by the project director, and will be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project, including completing training programs \nand providing assistance with postconstruction operations. The deputy minister of MCAT will \nserve as project director. MCAT will provide counterpart staff for the PIU to be assigned under \nthe project management consultants on a full-time basis. MCAT staff will play a supporting role \nin the PIU\u2019s operations and build up their technical competence for project management through \non-the-job training. Appendix 6 shows the organization of the PIU. \n \nc.  Advance Action for Procurement  \n \n49.  ADB management approved advance action for the procurement of consulting services, \ncivil  works,  and  equipment.  Such  advance  action  is  in  general  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement requirements and procedures. The approval of advance action will not necessarily \ncommit ADB to financing the Project.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n50.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  including  preconstruction  and \npostconstruction activities. The project management consultants will be mobilized in April 2005, \nand civil works will start in July 2005 and be completed by June 2007. The entire Project will be \ncompleted by June 2008. Appendix 7 presents a detailed implementation schedule.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n51.  The procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the Project will \nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  Government \nrequested flexible application of such guidelines, including shorter bidding periods of 60 days for \nthe procurement of civil works under international competitive bidding and no prequalification \nexercise  for  international  procurement.  The  Government  Procurement  Unit  of  Afghanistan \nReconstruction and Development Services (ARDS) will undertake all international procurement, \nincluding the recruitment of project management consultants. MCAT will execute and administer \nthe contracts in close coordination with the Government Procurement Unit of ARDS. For the \ncomponents cofinanced by UNOPS, UNOPS\u2019s own procurement procedures will be followed.  \n \n52.  All contracts for carrying out civil works and supplying equipment will be divided into \nsuitable contract packages. The civil works contracts are packaged as design-build to ensure \ndelivery within the project implementation period. The civil works contracts will be awarded \nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The  contracts  for  navigational  aid \nequipment will be procured using international shopping procedures given that only a limited \nnumber of suppliers are available and that the purchase of equipment needs to be expedited. All \nmanufacturers and suppliers of needed navigational aid equipment certified by the International \nCivil Aviation Organization will be invited to bid during the course of international shopping. \nIndicative contract packages are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n53.  Some of the project airports are located in the western part of the country, where ADB \nnonmember countries, particularly those in the Gulf region, are competitive sources of materials, ", "    1 3   \nespecially the bitumen required for runway pavement. Explicit procurement restrictions may \npreclude civil works contractors under the Project from seeking the best business terms, and \nultimately  erode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  development  impact  and \neconomic efficiency, it is proposed that civil works contractors under the Project be allowed to \nprocure the bitumen required for runway pavement from all countries, including from countries \nthat are not ADB members.6  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n54.  The consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod using complete technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The \nconsulting services will require about 301 person-months of international consultants and about \n152 person-months of domestic consultants. For designing an accounting system, individual \nconsultants will be engaged separately for 24 person-months of international consultants and 24 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting services \nare provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n55.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nAn  imprest  account,  primarily  for  expenditures  related  to  the  implementation  of  training, \npostconstruction operations assistance, and other operations support, will be established in \nMOF with a designated treasurer in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The \ndesignated treasurer will open a deposit account at the Da Afghanistan Bank to which ADB\u2019s \nloan proceeds will be transferred and against which the treasurer\u2019s checks will be issued. The \ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account will  be  the lesser  of  6  months  of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount. The statement of expenditure procedures \nwill be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account for any \nindividual payment transaction up to $50,000 equivalent.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n56.  MCAT will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project in accordance with \nsound accounting principles. The Government will ensure that MCAT has proper audit and \naccounting procedures in place to ensure efficient and economical use of the loan proceeds for \nthe beneficiaries. Separate project accounts and financial statements will be maintained that are \nadequate to identify the goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, the financing \nresources, the expenditures incurred, and the use of local funds. Such accounts and financial \nstatements will be maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and certified by \nindependent private auditors acceptable to ADB.  \n \n57.  The unaudited project accounts and related financial statements will be submitted to \nADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year, followed by the submission of \naudited project accounts and related financial statements no later than 9 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year. The annual audit will include an audit of the imprest account and statement of \nexpenditure records, and the audit report will include a separate opinion on the audit. The \n                                                 \n6 This is pursuant to Article 14 (ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, agree to permit procurement from \nnon-ADB member countries in special circumstances that make such procurement appropriate. ", "14      \nGovernment will help ADB representatives carry out spot and random checks on the flow and \nuse of funds. \n \n58.  MCAT, with PIU assistance, will be responsible for overall project monitoring. The PIU \nwill establish a system for preparing quarterly reports for performance monitoring and issues \nresolution plus periodic action plans. The action plans will incorporate quantitative and time-\nbound implementation targets and will be reviewed and approved by the PSC. The quarterly \nreports will serve as a feedback system for management to update and improve procedures and \nproject implementation. The PIU will submit the quarterly reports to ADB. Within 3 months of \nproject completion, the PIU will prepare a comprehensive project completion report on the \noverall impact of the Project.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n59.  Aided  by  the  PIU,  MCAT  will  undertake  quantitative  and  qualitative  performance \nmonitoring of each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \nproject benefits accrued. With the help of the project management consultants, no later than 3 \nmonths following loan effectiveness, MCAT will develop a comprehensive system for monitoring \nthe Project\u2019s performance. ADB will review and approve this system. ADB and the Government \nwill agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during the implementation of the \nProject and for 3 months after project completion. \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n60.  ADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nBased on the project schedule, a midterm review will be carried out around July 2006. The \nGovernment  will  submit  a  detailed  progress  report  on  the  Project\u2019s  implementation  and \nachievements to ADB prior to the midterm review. Terms of reference for the midterm review \nwill be included in the project administration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception \nMission for the Project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Financial Management and Financial Viability \n \n61.  Except for military airports, MCAT directly owns, manages, and operates all airports and \nair navigation services. All revenues generated by civil airports and air navigation services are \ncollected  by  the  civil  aviation  authorities  under  MCAT  and  deposited  in  the  Government \ntreasury. All expenditure on salaries, repairs and maintenance, and utilities are met by the \nGovernment\u2019s budget allocation. Accounting for the revenues and expenses of MCAT and the \nairports  and  air  navigation  services  is  centralized  in  MOF.  MOF  finalizes  the  operational \nexpenditure budget on the basis of proposals prepared by MCAT. After MOF finalizes the \ndetails of the annual expenditure budget, MCAT transfers the budget provision to each airport.  \n \n62.  Financial projections have been prepared for Afghanistan\u2019s civil aviation sector to assess \nthe Project\u2019s financial viability and sustainability as a whole (Appendix 9). The projections \nindicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover operating and maintenance costs.  \n \n63.  The financial evaluation for each airport was undertaken in real terms using constant \n2004 prices. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \neach airport under with and without project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return for the ", "    1 5   \nseven airports, computed on an after tax basis, ranges from 3.7% to 7.9%, with an average over \nall seven subprojects of 5%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, \nalso computed on an after tax basis, of 4%. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicates that the \nfinancial internal rate of return for all airports is robust under adverse conditions. Based on the \nfinancial projections and financial evaluation, the Project is considered both financially viable \nand sustainable. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n64.  For the economic evaluation, the benefits of the Project have been calculated in term of \nusers\u2019 willingness to pay as reflected in incremental revenues from airport operations, such as \nlanding charges, passenger service charges, and other fees and charges for airport services. \nThe evaluation also includes as assessment of (i)  benefits to operators, such as savings in \ndirect wear and tear costs and fuel; (ii) benefits to passengers, such as direct time savings; (iii) \nbenefits from safety improvements; and (iv) benefits to regional and local communities from \nsuch things as the development of tourism.  \n \n65.  The benefits to operators are substantial in terms of improvements in aircraft productivity \nresulting from reduced downtimes for maintenance; elimination of costs associated with damage \nto aircraft (external instruments, wing flaps, propeller blades, engines) caused by  flying stones \nfrom gravel runways; and reduced costs for tire replacement by extending the operational life of \ntires. Aircraft landing on a gravel surface take longer to stop than on a bitumen surface because \nof reduced braking efficiency, thus bitumen runways improve fuel efficiency. The Project will \nalso severely diminish the risk and economic costs of accidents or other incidents caused by \nairstrip incursions, which are increasingly becoming a safety hazard because of poor airstrip \nconditions and poor visibility. \n \n66.  The Project\u2019s economic costs include the resource costs for traded and nontraded costs, \nmaterials,  and  labor.  All  cost  elements  are  valued  at  border  prices,  using  a  world  price \nnumeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.80 was applied \nto the financial costs of nontraded inputs to calculate economic prices. Subproject facilities are \nexpected to have an average economic life of 30 years. \n \n67.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the seven airports ranges from 18.0% to \n28.4%, with a consolidated EIRR of 22.2%. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible \nunfavorable scenarios resulting from changes in the key parameters that determine the Project\u2019s \ncosts and benefits. This analysis indicates that the Project\u2019s economic viability would remain \nsatisfactory even under adverse scenarios, and that it would require a cost increase i of 113% \nor a decrease in benefits of 53% to reach a cut-off EIRR of 12%. Appendix 10 presents details \nof  the  economic  analysis.  The  project  benefits  distribution  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n68.  The Project\u2019s impact on land and resettlement will be insignificant, because most of the \nrehabilitation activities are to be carried out on land the Government already owns. Of the seven \nairports included in phase I, the Project will have land acquisition and resettlement impacts at \nonly  four  airports  (Bamyan,  Faizabad,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj).  The  Project  will  affect  42 \npermanent residential structures, as a result of which nearly 2 hectares of homestead land will ", "16      \nalso have to be acquired. In addition, 0.8 hectare of agricultural land owned by the Agriculture \nDepartment and currently being used by a private agency for agricultural research will have to \nbe transferred to MCAT. Two community structures, including one graveyard and one mosque, \nwill be affected, and five households currently cultivating Government land would suffer income \nlosses. Overall, the Project will affect 56 households and 196 people. Those people affected will \nreceive the replacement value of their property and other physical assets and assistance to \ncover income losses and relocation and additional assistance will also be provided to vulnerable \nhouseholds. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is AF7,853,023 or $0.17 \nmillion. The short resettlement plan has been translated into Dari and will be disclosed to those \naffected (Appendix 11). The complete plan will be publicly available at MCAT, ADB\u2019s Resident \nMission in Afghanistan, and ADB\u2019s web site.  \n \n2.  Indigenous People \n \n69.  Afghanistan is home to many ethnic and linguistic groups, as well as to several sects of \nIslam and to other religions. Historic and geographic factors have created and preserved this \ndiversity, although the degree of cultural assimilation varies and a considerable degree of \ncultural homogeneity exists. The main ethnic groups in the project area are Pushtuns, Tajik, \nHazara,  Turkoman,  Uzbek,  and  other  Muslim  and  non-Muslim  groups.  These  ethnic \ncommunities have become part of mainstream society and are prominent groups with large \npopulations  in  each  region.  The  social  assessment  did  not  identify  the  presence  of  any \nindigenous populations in the project area. None of the ethnic communities will be marginalized \nbecause of a dominant community in the region or by project development. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n70.  Approximately 53% of Afghanistan\u2019s population is classified as poor, that is, living on \nless than $1 per day or approximately 2,100 kilocalories per day. In the project provinces, the \naverage daily income is less than $1, no more than $0.74 per person per day, compared with a \nnational average income for unskilled labor of $1.7 to $3.2 per person per day. The social \nassessment in the project area also revealed that 50% to 60% of the population lives below the \npoverty line and has an average income of AF2,000 to AF3,000 per month. Thus high levels of \npoverty are apparent in all the project provinces.  \n \n71.  The direct benefit of the Project to poor households will be employment in construction \nactivities at airports in terms of net income earned during the project period. Both poor and \nnonpoor households are likely to benefit directly in the medium and long term, as additional jobs \nwill be created in airport administration and management, fire fighting services, and catering; \nwith  private  airlines;  with  local  contractor  firms  likely  to  be  involved  in  maintaining  airport \nfacilities; and, most important, in the tourism industry. An indirect but important impact will be \nthe provision of much needed humanitarian aid and basic public services to remote regions. The \nProject will also generate additional employment opportunities by facilitating access to regional \nand international markets for agricultural, livestock, and other manufactured and perishable \nproducts; facilitating regional trade; and stimulating the growth of local trade and enterprises.  \n \nE.  Environmental Impacts \n \n72.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  2003  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines. Therefore an initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken \nas part of the feasibility study. The IEE found that the Project would not have any significant ", "    1 7   \nimpact that would need to be assessed further. The most likely environmental impact is related \nto the construction work, such as erosion and sedimentation associated with earthworks. Other \nimpacts are increased dust and volatile gases from hot mix plants used for the reconstruction of \nrunways and taxiways and the contamination of surface water. All these impacts are temporary \nand mitigation measures are manageable. Mitigation measures during the construction stage \nwill be incorporated into contractors\u2019 job assignments, therefore the IEE report will have been \nmade available to contractors. The environmental impacts related with actual airport operations \nare (i) noise caused by increased air traffic; (ii) solid wastes and wastewater resulting from office \nand  airport  activities;  and  (iii)  oil  wastes  from  the  operation  of  power  generation,  aircraft \ncleaning, and refueling activities. However, given the level of airport operations, these impacts \nwill not be significant. Nonetheless, proper waste management and the installation of oil traps in \nall outlets and drainage facilities prior to discharging wastewater into water bodies will be \nnecessary. The summary IEE is in Appendix 13.  \n \nF.  Risks \n \n73.  Implementation of the Project entails a number of risks as follows: \n \n(i)  The overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will need to \nmonitor the situation closely and coordinate with local and central authorities and \nthe United Nations to ensure that ADB operations are adequately protected.7 \nADB\u2019s TA for the Security of ADB-Financed Projects in Afghanistan will provide \nadvice on how to ensure a safe work environment for on-site personnel assigned \nby  the  contractors,  subcontractors,  and  consulting  firms.  Under  prevailing \nconditions, however, the security risk cannot be mitigated completely, and delays \nin project implementation will be inevitable if security hazards occur in project \nlocations despite the measures put in place to control the risk. \n(ii)  The regional warlords have maintained their military strength and their influence \nin regional politics. This political instability could hamper a smooth supply of raw \nmaterials and equipment, which would be transported through areas controlled \nby regional warlords, and constrain the supervision of construction works by \nconsultants and ADB staff.  \n(iii)  The rehabilitated regional airports could be used to transport opium. The security \nchecks carried out in regional airports will be strengthened, but the distribution of \nopium  through  rehabilitated  airports  cannot  be  completely  contained  unless \nopium cultivation is eradicated.  \n(iv)  The implementation of key activities may be unduly delayed because of the \nGovernment\u2019s weak implementation capacity. Also the lack of accounting and \nauditing capacity implies a risk of corruption. Resources will be allocated for \nconsultancy services to help with project management and implementation. \n(v)  The PIU will consist of a team of consultants and MCAT staff with the deputy \nminister of MCATserving as project director. Because of the lack of capacity of \nMCAT staff, the consultant team will be responsible for a significant amount of \nthe work and take key decisions, and any lack of coordination between the \nproject  director  and  the  consultant  team  may  delay  project  implementation. \nADB\u2019s  Resident  Mission  will  play  a  key  role  in  facilitating  coordination  and \nprevent any stalemate in implementation.  \n                                                 \n7  Coordination with the provincial reconstruction team providing security for development activities in the project \nareas may also be explored. ", "18      \n(vi)  The  progress  of  project  implementation  may  be  disrupted  if  poorly  qualified \nMCAT staff are assigned to the PIU. The consultant team will be involved in \nselecting staff to be assigned to the PIU and will provide continuous training for \nthem once they have been selected and assigned.  \n(vii)  The Government Procurement Unit of ARDS, a dedicated agency for handling \nplanning, coordination, preparation, and procurement for major reconstruction \nprojects, will be responsible for all procurement related to the Project. A lack of \nclose coordination between the PIU and the Government Procurement Unit of \nARDS  will  delay  procurement.  The  Government  Procurement  Unit  will  be \ninvolved in project implementation as an observer of the PSC to provide technical \nadvice in procurement matters relating to the Project.  \n(viii)  The retention of trained MCAT staff will be a major challenge, as they may be \nlured by better remuneration offered by the private sector. MCAT will provide a \ntransparent career development path for its staff so they can plan their careers \nwith a long-term perspective. For those who receive overseas training, MCAT will \nobtain a commitment that they will either stay on in MCAT for a certain period \nafter their training or will repay the cost of training if they resign before the end of \nthe period. The Project includes an administrative support component to pay for \nextra remuneration for MCAT staff who are assigned to the PIU after training. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n74.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security for the \nsmooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure strengthened airport security checks to prevent and \ndetect smuggling of opium through improved air transport. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that adequate budgetary allocations of the required \ncounterpart  funds  are  made,  approved,  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  to \nensure proper implementation of the Project. The Government will also ensure \nthat  adequate  staff  resources  are  allocated  for  the  Project  by  concerned \nministries as required for implementation of the Project. \n(iv)  The Government will allocate and make available, in a timely manner, sufficient \nfunds from its budget for each fiscal year for the operation and maintenance of \nthe project facilities and ensure that such facilities are operated and maintained \nin accordance with sound practices in the civil aviation sector. The Government \nwill also ensure that after completion of airport rehabilitation, a post-construction \noperations assistance team will be established under MCAT which will consist of \nexternal experts for airport operation, and take charge of the operations and \nmaintenance for the rehabilitated airports for 1 year, providing on-the-job training \nfor MCAT staff assigned to the team. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the temperature-controlled storage facilities to \nbe provided by the Project will be leased out to a private sector operator for \nsustainable operation and maintenance of the facilities, following transparent and \nfair procedures for selection of such a private sector operator. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that no duties or other similar levies will be imposed \non any equipment, material, or services required for the Project, and if such ", "    1 9   \nduties and levies are imposed, they will be paid by the Government promptly to \nensure timely project implementation. \n(vii)  To the extent feasible, the Government will ensure that the reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of the project facilities will be carried out on land already acquired \nand/or owned by the Government. In case there are adjustments to the rights-of-\nway that necessitate land acquisition, the Government will ensure that the social \nand economic condition of the affected persons, regardless of the land title, will \nbe restored and/or enhanced through mitigating measures. The Government will \nfurther ensure that any land acquisition and resettlement activities will be carried \nout in accordance with the relevant laws and policies of the Government, the \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement,1995, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeople,1998 as set forth in the short resettlement plan. The Government will also \nensure that, all land and rights-of-way required for project implementation will be \nmade available in a timely manner. \n(viii)  The short resettlement plan will be updated by MCAT through the PIU, based on \ndetailed design and will be subject to ADB approval before award of civil works \ncontract.  MCAT  will  disclose  the  short  resettlement  plan  and  make  the \ninformation  available  to  all  affected  people  before  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and confirm that such information is posted on ADB\u2019s web site. \nMCAT  will  also  submit  revised  resettlement  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  approval  if  the \nGovernment enforces civil aviation law standards of maintaining a clear zone of \n150-meter flyover area outside the 90-meter graded runway strip for the airports \nduring project implementation. \n(ix)  The  Government  will  implement  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy, 2002, the IEE and the environmental monitoring plan. For \nthis purpose the Government will make available adequate budget, and ensure \nthat  all  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  set  out  in  the  IEE  and  the \nenvironment monitoring plan are incorporated in the design, including detailed \ndesign, of the project facilities, and implemented during construction, operation, \nand maintenance thereof.  \n(x)  The Government will ensure that a specific plan for local consultation to address \nsafety, social, and cultural issues, during project implementation, will be included \nin the bidding documents. The Government will further ensure that men and \nwomen are given equal employment opportunities and without any differentiation \nof  wages  for  equal  work  by  the  civil  work  contractors.  The  mechanism  for \nmaximizing local employment benefits will be included in the project design and \nthe bidding documents. \n(xi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts  include  legally \nmandated  provisions  on  health  and  sanitation  and  on  appropriate  working \nconditions, including, as appropriate, accommodation, for construction workers at \ncampsites during the construction period. The Government will also ensure that \ncivil work contractors do not employ children for construction and maintenance \nworks. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n75.  The Government will have established the PIU within MCAT and appointed the project \ndirector. \n ", "20      \nC.  Conditions for Loan Disbursement \n \n76.  The Government will have established a capacity building unit in MCAT. For the unit, the \nGovernment will have (i) obtained PRR status (stage 1), and (ii) submitted the application for \nPRR status (stage 2) to the relevant authority.  \n \n77.

Introduction \n \n1.  Civil  aviation  has  always  played  an  important  role  in  transportation  in  Afghanistan \nbecause of the high costs of land transport caused mainly by difficult terrain, severe weather \nconditions  ranging  from  snow  to  sandstorms  and  high  temperatures,  flash  flooding,  and \nbanditry. \n \n2.  Prior to 1989, civil aviation was reasonably well developed and well patronized by local \ncommunities and foreign tourists. Passenger and freight data for 1980 indicate that upward of \n125,000 passengers traveled between 12 airports. However, after 20 years of conflict, most of \nthe sector\u2019s infrastructure has either been damaged or destroyed, airlines have been decimated, \nand trained human resources have been severely depleted. Since 2002, limited civil aviation \nhas given crucial support to emergency rehabilitation and recovery efforts, and the nation \nbuilding  processes  currently  under  way  will  be  highly  dependent  on  civil  aviation  for  the \nforeseeable future. \n \n3.  The  national  road  system,  which  is  currently  in  poor  condition,  is  undergoing  an \nextensive rehabilitation program, with completion of the ring road as the first priority. While this \nwill restore relatively rapid and reliable services for freight and passengers within proximity of \nthe ring road, many other more isolated provincial centers with large populations will have to \nwait many years for good road connections. Many roads may never be upgraded to highway \nstandards because of constraints imposed by the terrain. \n \n4.  Airports and air transport present different challenges for policymakers and regulators. \nThe differences arise from the cost characteristics and from the market structures through which \neach transportation subsector provides facilities and services. Afghanistan\u2019s airport industry is \nundergoing a transformation from being a grossly undermanaged public utility in decline with \nmounting financial losses, a result of the prolonged conflict situation, to being a more efficient, \nmarket-oriented industry with a more commercial outlook.  \n \n5.  Changes in Afghanistan\u2019s political and economic growth prospects have created a new \nchallenge, namely, establishing an appropriate form of competition and rebuilding regulatory \ninstitutions to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of domestic and international \naviation services. \n \n6.  The  Government  is  currently  addressing  the  aviation  sector\u2019s  rehabilitation  and \ndevelopment needs required to support the rebound with financial and technical assistance from \nexternal  funding  agencies.  If  the  current  trend  in  development  is  to  be  sustainable,  the \nGovernment needs to remove as many as possible of the impediments that tend to suppress \nbusiness and consumer confidence. \n \nB.  Institutional Organization and Responsibilities \n \n7.  Prior to 1989, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT) was responsible for \nairport operations and generally provided an airport manager and air traffic control staff for each \nairport. The Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) was responsible for airport design, construction, \nand maintenance. While MCAT is currently continuing with airport management at all airports \nand air traffic control at certain of the larger domestic airports, MOPW has not played a role in \nairports for many years. As a result, little airport maintenance work has been carried out since \n   ", "24   Appendix 2 \n1989. MCAT currently has no capability to carry out either day-to-day or major, periodic airport \nmaintenance, but does intend to take over airport design, construction, and maintenance in the \nfuture. \n \nC.  Airport Infrastructure and Supporting Services \n \n1.  Infrastructure \n \n8.  Published  information  indicates  that  Afghanistan  had  47  airports  in  2002,  including \nseasonal landing strips in remote border areas, or roughly 1.63 airports per 1 million people. Of \nthese 47 airports, 10 were reported to have paved runways (with 3 of these located above 3,047 \nmeters), while the remaining 37 have gravel runways. The country also has five heliports \nserving military and humanitarian needs. However, the United Nations Joint Logistics Center \nonly recognizes 27 airports, of which only the following 13 receive commercial flights: \n \n(i)  international (category I): Kabul, Kandahar; \n(ii)  major domestic (category II): Herat, Kunduz, Jalalabad, Mazar-e-Sharif; \n(iii)  regional  (category  III):  Bamyan,  Chaghcharan,  Faizabad,  Farah,  Maimana, \nTaloqan; and \n(iv)  subregional (category IV): Zaranj. \n \n9.  Because of the restructuring of MCAT and a reduction in the agency\u2019s personnel and \nfinancial  resources,  regional  airstrips  are  not  being  maintained  and  are  being  allowed  to \ndeteriorate. This situation has serious implications for aircraft passenger and crew safety and for \nthe cost of operations.  \n \n10.  The Government has prepared a civil aviation and airport development plan, which is in \nline with International Civil Aviation Organization standards and recommendations and reflects \nthe priorities and strategy of MCAT. The plans includes \n(i)  upgrading Kabul International Airport to full international standards, including the \nterminal building, facilities, and amenities, at a cost of approximately $100 million \nover 7 years; \n(ii)  upgrading the international terminals at Herat, Jalalabad, and Mazar-e-Sharif at \nan estimated cost of $50 million over 7 years; \n(iii)  rehabilitating the two major domestic airports at Kunduz and Faizabad at an \nestimated cost of $10 million each over 7 years; and \n(iv)  rehabilitating the remaining 13 domestic airports in two phases at an estimated \ncost of $5 million for each airport.  \n \n11.  The total cost of the plan is estimated at $375 million and is to be apportioned as follows: \nrunways, 30%; terminals and required facilities, 20%; vehicles and equipment, 20%; air traffic \ncontrol, 15%; approach roads and parking, 10%; and aviation safety, 5%. \n \n12.  The  aim  is  for  all  airports  to  be able  to  handle  more  landings,  thereby  generating \nsubstantial revenue for the Government, improving linkages, and allowing for faster travel to and \nfrom the rest of the world and between regional centers, which will increase tourist penetration. \n \n2.  Air Navigation Services \n \n13.  All navigation, communication, landing aid, and meteorological facilities were destroyed \nduring the conflict. NATO currently provides air traffic control services at Kabul International \n ", "     Appendix 2  25  \nAirport. Only daytime flights are accepted for regional services. At present, no facilities for air \ntraffic management exist at the major domestic and regional airports. There is also an acute \nshortage of qualified and trained air traffic controllers and maintenance personnel. \n \n14.  Currently, MCAT levies a $400 charge on all international and inter-regional airline flights \noverflying the country even though minimal information is provided to air crews. \n \n \n3.  Meteorological Services \n \n15.  Meteorological services at Kabul and all other regional and domestic services are out of \nservice until International Security Assistance Force, and then NATO, install their own services. \nThere is an urgent need to install and train specialists in the operation of automatic weather \nobservation systems at the two international airports (Kabul and Kandahar) and the four main \ndomestic airports (Herat, Kunduz, Jalalabad, and Mazar-I-Sharif). \n \n4.  Safety Oversight \n \n16.  The civil aviation safety orders of 1972 do not provide MCAT with clear power and \nauthority to regulate civil aviation, and therefore the authority to issue regulations, orders, and \ndirectives necessary to ensure the safety of aviation, i.e., those pertaining to security, accident \nand incident reporting, certification of airports, licensing of air traffic controllers, and certification \nof air operators. The authority over these areas is not institutionalized in the organization, which \ncan seriously hinder the sector\u2019s development. \n \n17.  Airport  incursion  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  at  many  airstrips  and  is  likely  to \ncontinue. Airstrips are used for many community activities, but are primarily used as a means of \naccess, especially where local footpaths and vehicle tracks cross runways or run alongside \nthem. This is a matter that needs to be addressed to reduce the probability of accidents that \ncould be catastrophic for crews, passengers, and local bystanders. \n \n5.  Human Resources \n \n18.  Aviation in Afghanistan faces serious human resource challenges because of the lack of \nskilled  manpower.  To  be  sustainable  in  a  deregulated  market,  MCAT  and  other  aviation \nagencies will need to recruit and train suitable personnel if investment over the next 7 years is to \nbe  sustainable.  Like  in  many  other  developing  countries,  the  maintenance  and  upkeep  of \ninfrastructure and services is essential for supporting on-going improvements in efficiency and \nlowering utilization costs. \n \n19.  When new infrastructure comes on-stream starting at the end of 2005, properly staffing \nthe  airports  with  personnel  trained  in  airport  management,  operations,  maintenance,  fire \nfighting,  and  so  on  will  be  essential.  Hence  the  intensive  training  program  that  is  being \nundertaken as part of the Project. \n \nD.  Domestic Civil Aviation \n \n1.  Market \n \n20.  At this early stage in the development of the postwar, domestic aviation sector, the \nmarket served is predominantly humanitarian, but with a growing commercial sector. This is not \n   ", "26   Appendix 2 \nunexpected after a prolonged period of internal conflict. Much, if not all, of the road network \ninfrastructure has deteriorated to such an extent that a journey by road\u2014often the preferred \nchoice of nongovernment organizations (NGOs)\u2014is long and arduous; safety and security are \nstill major concerns, with many areas of the country still classified as serious security risk areas; \nand facilities available to travelers are basic or nonexistent. \n \n21.  The domestic aviation sector serves and supports the high-value, time-sensitive end of \nthe transport market. In 2000, up to 3,400 departures were recorded. During this early stage of \npostwar reconstruction, the market as a whole is characterized by widely varying load factors, \nfrequent long delays, and varying probability of a service cancellation depending on the security \nsituation and the operating environment of the destination airstrip (Table A2.1). \n \nTable A2.1: Representative Load Factors and Cancellation Rates, Project Airports \nAverage Load Factor  Probability of a Cancellation \nAirport  (%)  (%) \nBamyan  60    5 \nChaghcharan  20  75 \nFaizabad  40  10 \nFarah  10  75 \nMaimana     5  10 \nQalai-Naw  40  75 \nZaranj  10  10 \nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n \n22.  Aircraft currently serving regional domestic airports out of Kabul include small-seater \nB190s, B200s, F28s, and others up to the 47-seater AN24. Although improving airstrip runways \nto International Civil Aviation Organization standards is unlikely in the near future, it would give \noperators  the  flexibility  to  change  their  technology  to  meet  market  demand  needs  more \nefficiently and be able to respond to changes in load factors. \n \n2.  Operators \n \n23.  Prior to 1989, air travel was a well-developed mode of transport in Afghanistan, popular \nwith tourists, Afghan business people, government officials, and other users with the money to \nfly. Two airlines served an extensive domestic network that gave access to the main cities of \nmost provinces and to a number of smaller, isolated communities. \n \n24.  Because of the destruction of airport, navigation aid, and air traffic control infrastructure \nin the years of conflict, domestic air services are currently rudimentary. The state airline, Ariana \nAfghan Airlines, is still recovering from severe losses of equipment and skilled personnel, but \nprovides limited domestic services from Kabul to Herat, Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-\nSharif. The Boeing B727 aircraft used by Ariana are expensive to operate, their technology is \nold, and they are too big for domestic services. \n \n25.  United Nations agencies and NGOs started a network of domestic services immediately \nfollowing  the  commencement  of  international  assistance  to  Afghanistan  in  2002.  These \nservices, operated by United Nations Humanitarian Air Services (UNHAS), the United Nations \nAssistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA), and Partners in Aviation Communications and \nTechnology (PacTec), use small aircraft with 8 to 18 seats and chiefly cater to United Nations \nand NGO personnel. UNHAS will continue this support role even when commercial services \nbecome more widespread. UNHAS also operates a DC9 between Kabul and Dubai, Dushanbe, \n ", "     Appendix 2  27  \nHerat, Islamabad, and Kandahar, while UNAMA has one or two An72 mixed configuration \ncargo/passenger aircraft mainly for domestic use. \n \n26.  Kam Air, a start-up airline that began operations in November 2003, is operating both \ninternational and domestic services. Its domestic network currently serves six or eight airports \nusing 50-seat An24 aircraft. Indications already suggest that a large, untapped demand for air \nservices exists, which can only be met by developing new commercial air services. Such \ndevelopment must be underpinned by the rehabilitation of airports and supporting infrastructure. \n \n27.  A  number  of  corporate  charter  aircraft  also  operate  within  Afghanistan  and  nearby \ncountries. These are all small turboprops similar to the Beechcraft 200 and 1900s operated by \nUNHAS, UNAMA, and PacTec. Many large cargo aircraft fly into Kabul and Kandahar on both \ncivil  and  military  missions,  but  few  are  deployed  to  other  domestic airports.  Nevertheless, \nmilitary C130 cargo aircraft regularly fly to some airports, including Bamyan. \n \nE.  Opportunities for Improving Airport Efficiency \n \n28.  As in all industrial and many developing economies, air travel will continue to play an \nessential role in Afghanistan. It can provide a safe, fast, comfortable, and convenient connection \nbetween the capital, Kabul, and other centers of commerce, administration, and tourism. As \nsuch, it can appeal to business people, government officials, international and domestic tourists, \nand  to  citizens  who  have  the  means  to  travel  for  personal  reasons.  Air  cargo  is  also  an \nimportant  factor,  enabling  the  delivery  of  urgent  supplies  and  exports  of  high\u2013value,  low\u2013\nvolume, manufactured or perishable products. Air also provides rapid access for humanitarian \naid to areas that might be devastated by natural disasters, famine, epidemics, and the like and \nfor the evacuation of the sick and injured. When the country returns to relative stability and the \nnormal processes of nation building commence, unfettered by security concerns and uncertainty \nabout the future, civil aviation will become even more important to the national economy. \n \n   ", " 28  Appendix 3 \n \nOUTLINE OF PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF RUNWAYS AND REQUIRED EQUIPMENT  \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Project includes rehabilitating runways, taxiways, aprons, offices, and passenger \nterminals and supplying equipment for navigation aids and airport maintenance at seven regional \nairports in Bamian, Chaghcharan, Faizabad, Farah, Maimana, Qalai-Naw, and Zaranj.  \n \n2.  The runways of these airports have deteriorated to the extent that they have no standard \nasphalt pavement and insufficient runway strips. These poor physical conditions, along with the \nlack of navigation aids, have limited aircraft operations and increased the risk of accidents. \n \n3.  All seven airports also lack the  basic  facilities  for  civil  aviation, such as water and \nelectricity  supply,  security  fences,  and  maintenance  equipment.  For  minimum  commercial \noperations, existing passenger terminals need to be renovated at four of the airports and new \npassenger terminals are required at the other three.  \n \n4.   As required by the terms of reference for the project preparatory technical assistance1, \nthe consultant conducted the feasibility study for the project airports and prepared preliminary \ndesigns.  The  consultant  designed  infrastructure  and  equipment  in  accordance  with  the \nrecommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for airport infrastructure, \nmovement  area  design,  and  operational  equipment.  ICAO  has  developed  standards  and \nrecommended practices to ensure the safety and efficiency of air transport and airport facilities.  \n \nThe principal recommendations are that the Project should provide \n(i)   Airport facilities: \n(a)  paved runways that are as maintenance free as possible,  \n(b)  runway strips at least 90 meters wide, \n(c)  passenger terminal buildings and basic security,  \n(d)  stock-proof boundary fencing, \n(e)  water supply and sewerage facilities, and \n(f)  maintenance equipment for facilities and structures.  \n         \n(ii)   Operational facilities: \n(a)  control towers, \n(b)  automatic weather observation systems,  \n(c)  precision approach path indicators, \n(d)  other visual aids to identify runways when visibility is poor (Zaranj), and \n(e)  generators. \n \nB.   Physical Dimensions  \n \n1.   Dimension of Runway and Runway Strips \n \n5.  As the seven airports are categorized as regional airports in accordance with designation \n3C of the ICAO code, it is recommended that runways be at least 30 meters wide and runway \nstrips be 90 meters to 150 meters wide as indicated in Table A3.1 \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

All major domestic airports in  \n   Afghanistan have 45 m wide runways. \ne  Nonprecision approach runways. \nf  At those airports where 150-meter runway strips are not achievable, a minimum graded strip width of 90 meters will \nbe applied for daylight operations under visual meteorological conditions. Where possible, a total strip width of 150 \nmeters will be provided, i.e., a graded width of 90 meters plus a 30-meter \u201cfly-over\u201d area on each side. \nSource: consultant report \n \n \n6.  It is recommended that rehabilitated runways retain the current operational lengths where \npossible, because the aircraft to be used are likely to remain the same as those currently being \nused. Nevertheless, some runways will be shortened  because of  physical restrictions to the \nextent which is required for the operation of each design aircraft as indicated in Table A3.2. \n \n \nTable A3.2: Runway Length of Each Airport  \n \n  Runway Length  \n \n  (m) \n \n  Existing  Proposed   Paved Stopway  \nAirport  (30 m wide)  (30 m wide) \nBamyan   2,590  2,450  60 m each end \nChaghcharan  1,950  1,880   \nFaizabad  2,000  2,000   \nMaimana  2,000  2,000   \nQalai-Naw  2,100  1,880  60 m each end \nFarah  2,600  2,000   \nZaranj  1,800  2,000   \nm = meter. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n \n   ", " 30  Appendix 3 \n \n \n2.   Pavement Design  \n \n7.  The thickness of pavement for each airport is designed taking into account the aircraft to \nbe used, the expected number of flights, and the bearing capacity of the subgrade under the \npavement. For Bamian, Chaghcharan, Farah, Maimana, and Qalai-Naw airports, where existing \ngravel runways can be considered as sub-base courses,  a total pavement thickness of 200 \nmillimeters is recommended, of which 50 millimeters is an asphalt concrete wearing course over \na base course of 150 millimeters of highest quality crushed rock.  \n \n8.  Faizabad Airport needs a new runway parallel to the existing one, because it is covered \nby steel panels. The runway at Zaranj Airport has no pavement and subgrade, and the condition \nof  the  soil  is  worse  than  at  the  other  airports.  Therefore  thicker  total  pavements  of  550 \nmillimeters  and  1,000  millimeters  are  recommended  at  Faizabad  and  Zaranj  airports, \nrespectively. \n \nC.   Equipment  \n \n9.  In relation to navigation aids, precision approach path indicator systems will be provided \nat the seven airports to assist with landings. The system\u2019s lights boxes, located alongside the \ntouchdown point,  will give  pilots an  approach slope indication. In addition, flashing strobe \nthreshold identifications and runway lead-in lighting will be installed at Zaranj airport because of \nits permanent low visibility during the summer. Standard windsocks and masts will be provided \nto  indicate  wind  direction.

Financial Management \n \n1.  The  Ministry  of  Civil  Aviation  and  Tourism  (MCAT)  owns,  manages,  and  directly \noperates all airports and air navigation services in Afghanistan except military airports. All \nrevenues generated by civil airports and air navigation services are collected by the civil aviation \nauthorities under MCAT and deposited in the Government treasury. The Government budget \nallocation covers all expenditure on salaries, repairs and maintenance, and utilities.  \n \n2.  Accounting  for  the  revenues  and  expenses  of  MCAT  and  of  the  airports  and  air \nnavigation  services  is  centralized  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  MOF  finalizes  the \noperational expenditure budget on the basis of a proposal prepared by MCAT. After MOF \nfinalizes the details of the annual expenditure budget, MCAT transfers the budget provision to \neach airport. A summary of budgetary provisions for 2004\u20132005 is in Table A9.1 \n \nTable A9.1: Budgetary Provisions for Operational Expenditure for MCAT and Airports, \n2004\u20132005  \n(AF\u2018000) \nTools and Repair and Land and  Pension\nAirports Salary Services Materials Maintenance Structures Benefits Total\nMCAT and Kabul 29,858 3,984 3,390 3,839 2,346 36 43,453\nKandahar 1,399 120 200 400 200 2 2,321\nHerat 1,035 70 140 280 270 1 1,796\nMazar-e-Sharif 923 60 130 260 246 1 1,620\nKunduz 531 41 80 160 200 1 1,013\nJalalabd 475 35 65 130 140 1 846\nFaizabad 447 35 65 130 100 1 778\nMaimana 391 34 60 120 136 1 742\nTaloqan 336 24 40 80 100 0 580\nShebergan 336 30 40 80 45 0 531\nZaranj 307 30 40 80 80 1 538\nChaghcharan 307 30 40 80 80 1 538\nBamyan 280 20 40 80 200 0 620\nOther 1,623 169 290 580 247 3 2,912\nTotal 38,248 4,682 4,620 6,299 4,390 49 58,288\n \nSource: MCAT data. \n \n3.   Accounts for civil aviation follow the Government accounting system and are maintained \non a cash basis. Under this system, capital expenditure incurred on a project is presented as \nexpenditure in the year of occurrence and cumulative numbers are not available. Therefore \nascertaining the true value of airport assets is difficult. Depreciation is not accounted for in the \nGovernment accounting system. Revenues from scheduled flights are directly collected by the \ntreasury  of  MOF.  Revenues  from  nonscheduled  flights  are  collected  by  the  airports  and \ndeposited in the treasury of MOF. Given this particular accounting system, and more important, \nbecause of the loss of records during the conflict in recent decades, assessing the financial \nsituation of civil aviation activities accurately, especially for individual airports and services, is \nvirtually impossible. \n \n   ", "38  Appendix 9 \n \n \n4.  Actual  expenditures  airports  incur  against  their  budget  allocations  are  not  always \nreported to MCAT in a timely fashion. The main reason for this is that the major, regional, and \nsubregional airports fall under the administrative jurisdiction of the governors of provinces, and \nthus the financial allocations are transferred to the respective governors. Furthermore, the \nreporting system for expenditures is poor, and hence actual expenditure figures for the various \nairports, and also for the entire civil aviation sector, are not readily available in MCAT. In the \ncase of revenues, MCAT bills scheduled airlines for landing, parking, and air traffic services, but \nfor nonscheduled flights, unless arrangements are made ahead of time, the airport operators \nnormally  collect  the  charges  in  cash  and  MCAT  does  not  always  obtain  complete,  timely \ninformation about deposits from airport operators. Thus aggregate revenue figures by airport are \nnot available, and as a result, MCAT does not have accurate numbers for actual expenditures \non and revenues from civil aviation operations.  \n \n5.  This poor financial management capacity is pervasive in all sectors in Afghanistan. The \nWorld  Bank  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  are  providing  assistance  to \nstrengthen public administration and improve public accounting at the central Government level. \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for MCAT, programmed for 2005, will support \nthe  redesign  and  upgrading  of  MCAT\u2019s  accounting  system.  In  the  short  term,  the  project \nmanagement consultants to be engaged by the Project will set up an accounting system for \nproject implementation and airport operations. MCAT staff will be trained in this new system fas \npart of the project assistance for postconstruction operations.  \n \nB.  Financial Sustainability of the Civil Aviation Sector \n \n6.  Table A9.2 shows operational revenues and expenditures for civil aviation for 2003\u2013\n2004.  During  this  period,  the  revenues  generated  by  civil  aviation  activities  substantially \nexceeded operational expenditures, generating a surplus of more than $17 million. Almost the \nentire surplus came from overflying charges; however, even without the overflying charge, \noperating revenues can cover operating expenditures. Furthermore, overflights are increasing. \nHowever,  the  surplus  will  decline  substantially  when  operating  revenues  are  spent  on \nrehabilitation and development of facilities and services at airports and on training existing staff \nand recruiting qualified new staff.  \n \n7.  The  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  forecast  operating  revenues  and \nexpenditures for the civil aviation sector in Afghanistan as part of its preparation of a civil \naviation  master  plan  funded  by  ADB  technical  assistance.  The  forecast  is  based  on  the \nassumption that airport operations will be normalized so as to finance investment and human \nresource development with funds generated by civil aviation activities. Table 9.3 presents the \nforecast for revenues and expenditures.  \n \n8.  The forecast for revenues and expenditures indicates that the civil aviation sector is \nfinancially self-sustainable in the short term, medium term, and long term. However, if the \noverflying charges were not allocated to the civil aviation sector, the sector would suffer from a \nlack of investment in rehabilitation and the development of airport infrastructure that would \ndamage the sector\u2019s self-sustainability in the long-term. \n ", "                                                                                                                         Appendix 9         39\nTable A9.2: Operational Revenues and Expenditures for Civil Aviation, \n2003\u20132004 \n  Total \nItem  Afghani Dollars ($) \nRevenue \nLanding Charge  44,850 623,724 624,621\nParking Charge  11,435 365,326 365,555\nRoute Navagation Services  0 227,800 227,800\nPassenger Service Charge  1,456,823 0 29,136\nNon-Aeronautical Revenue  0 70,813 70,813\nLicence Fee, etc  1,800 0 36\n        Subtotal  1,514,908 1,287,663 1,317,961\nOver-Flying Charge  0 17,136,400 17,136,400\nTotal Revenue  1,514,908 18,424,063 18,454,361\nExpenditures \nSalaries  36,840,581 0 736,812\nOthers   15,990,273 0 319,805\nTotal Expenditures 52,830,854 0 1,056,617\n          Source: Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and Ministry of Finance data. \n \nTable A9.3: Forecast Operational Revenues and Expenditures of the Civil Aviation \nSector, Selected Years \n($) \nItem 2004 2008 2013\nRevenue\nLanding Charge 624,621 876,900 1,066,900\nParking Charge 365,555 401,500 452,000\nRoute Navagation Services 227,800 290,700 353,700\nPassenger Service Charge 29,136 2,700,000 3,567,200\nNon-Aeronautical Revenue 70,813 442,000 897,500\nLicence Fee, etc 36 50 80\n        Subtotal 1,317,961 4,711,150 6,337,380\nOver-Flying Charge 17,136,400 21,870,900 27,913,400\nTotal Revenue 18,454,361 26,582,050 34,250,780\nExpenditures\nSalaries 736,812 1,171,900 2,197,300\nOperation and Maintenance 319,805 3,000,000 5,000,000\nCapital Investments 0 15,000,000 25,000,000\nTotal Expenditure 1,056,617 19,171,900 32,197,300\nSource: International Civil Aviation Organization forecast. \n \n   ", "40  Appendix 9 \n \n \nC.  Financial Analysis  \n \n9.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was estimated using a with Project and \nwithout Project comparison. The major assumptions are that (i) the FIRR reflects constant 2004 \nprices, (ii) the capital costs include all incremental capital expenditures associated with the \nproposed  investment  program  less  interest  charges  during  construction,  (iii)  the  costs  of \nincremental operations and maintenance include periodic maintenance that will be carried out in \nthe year of 2019, (iv) the projections used to derive airport revenue streams were developed \nspecifically for forecasting aircraft movements and passenger volumes, (v) the tariffs at airports \nwith higher volumes will be adjusted when costs equal revenues, and (vi) the revenue and cost \nstreams are compared for a 30-year period with no residual value. The expenditure components \nof the analysis include the initial capital costs, recurrent annual costs, and periodic maintenance \ncosts. Included in expenditures is the cost of staffing airports with managers, administrative \nstaff, cleaners, and maintenance staff.  \n \n10.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated as 4% in line with the \nminimum  requirement  as  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. The FIRR for the seven project airports \nranges 3.7% to 7.9%, with an aggregate FIRR of 5.0% (Table 9.4). \n \n11.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of possible unfavorable changes in \nkey parameters that determine the Project\u2019s costs and revenues. The results are shown in Table \nA9.5.  \n \nTable A9.4: Financial Internal Rate of Return by Airport \n \nAirport FIRR (%)\nBamyan 4.6\nChaghcharan 3.7\nFaizabad 7.9\nFarah 4.4\nMaimana 4.5\nQalai-Naw 4.3\nZaranj 3.7\n      Aggregate 5.0\n  FIRR = financial internal rate of return \n  Source: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \n12.  Two airports, Chaghcharan and Zaranj, have an FIRR slightly lower than the WACC. As \nindicated earlier, the civil aviation sector is in general financially self-sustainable in the short, \nmedium, and long term. The two airports whose FIRR is lower than the WACC show a robust \neconomic internal rate of return. The implication is that national resources are transferred to the \nusers of these two airports in the form of a subsidy. If the economic internal rate of return is \nhigher than the threshold and the two airports are a Government priority for investment to \nprovide better access to local users of air transport services, the subsidy can be justified as long \nas the aviation sector is financially self-sustainable. \n ", "                                                                                                                         Appendix 9         41\n \nTable A9.5: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nSensitivity Item Change FIRR (%)\nBase Case 5.0\nCost Increase 10% 4.4\nRevenue Decrease 10% 4.2\nImplementation Delay 1 year 4.8\n \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \n  Source: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \nTable A9.6: Financial Internal Rate of Return 2005-2034\n(AF million)\nCosts Incremental Revenues\nIncremental Landing  Passenger  Parking Net\nYear Capital Operating Charges Service  Charges Revenues\nCharges\n2005 245.8 -245.75\n2006 491.5 -491.51\n2007 245.8 1.5 5.1 14.7 11.7 -215.69\n2008 1.5 5.5 15.9 12.6 32.47\n2009 1.5 5.9 17.1 13.5 35.06\n2010 1.5 6.4 18.4 14.6 37.87\n2011 1.5 7.1 20.1 15.9 41.65\n2012 1.5 7.8 22.0 17.5 45.81\n2013 1.5 8.5 24.2 19.1 50.39\n2014 1.5 9.4 26.5 21.0 55.42\n2015 1.5 10.3 29.1 23.0 60.94\n2016 1.5 11.2 31.3 24.8 65.82\n2017 1.5 12.1 33.8 26.0 70.32\n2018 1.5 13.0 36.4 27.2 75.18\n2019 240.6 14.1 39.2 28.0 -159.29\n2020 1.5 15.2 42.3 28.2 84.26\n2021 1.5 16.4 45.6 28.5 89.04\n2022 1.5 17.7 49.2 28.7 94.18\n2023 1.5 18.8 52.1 28.9 98.39\n2024 1.5 20.1 55.4 28.9 102.97\n2025 1.5 21.5 58.9 28.9 107.88\n2026 1.5 23.0 62.7 28.9 113.12\n2027 1.5 24.6 66.6 28.9 118.71\n2028 1.5 26.3 70.9 28.9 124.67\n2029 1.5 28.2 75.4 28.9 131.04\n2030 1.5 30.2 80.2 28.9 137.83\n2031 1.5 32.3 85.3 28.9 145.08\n2032 1.5 34.6 90.7 28.9 152.82\n2033 1.5 37.1 96.6 28.9 161.17\n2034 1.5 39.7 102.9 28.9 170.07\nFinancial Net Present Value 146.9\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%) 5.0\nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n   ", "42   Appendix 10 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  Prior to 1989, air travel was a well-developed transport mode in Afghanistan, popular \nwith tourists and Afghan business people, government officials, and others. Two airlines served \nan extensive domestic network that provided access to the main cities of most provinces and a \nnumber of smaller, isolated communities. Because of the destruction of airport, navigational aid, \nand  air  traffic  control  infrastructure  in  the  years  of  conflict,  domestic  air  services  are \nrudimentary. Currently the condition of regional airports is such that it only allows for restricted \noperations, and these are often curtailed by poor airstrip condition, poor visibility, and the \nabsence of adequate terminal conditions and security. \n \n2.  The Project will help Afghanistan address its domestic needs for aviation development. \nDuring phase I of the Project, rehabilitation work will be carried at seven regional airports: \nBamyan,  Chaghcharan,  Farah,  Faizabad,  Maimana,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj.  The  proposed \nupgrading and improvement works will include the following:  \n \n(i)  level 1: constructing perimeter fences to improve airstrip safety and the efficiency \nof air service operators;  \n(ii)  level 2: reducing the substantial cost of aircraft maintenance and repairs by \nupgrading gravel pavement to asphalt standard; and \n(iii)  level 3: constructing adequate terminal and airport operation facilities, including \ncontrol towers. \n \n3.  The main objective of the Project is to enhance civil aviation infrastructure to support \nreliable and safe operations in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \nstandards across all major and minor airports in the country. Bringing these airports up to \nstandard will (i) remove infrastructure constraints on the growth of domestic air services; (ii) \nreduce  airlines\u2019  operational  costs;  (iii)  improve  air  safety;  (iv)  assist  the  development  of \ncommercial,  agricultural,  and  tourism  activities  in  the  Project  areas  and  improve  market \nconnections; (v) facilitate the provision of much needed humanitarian aid and basic public \nservices  to  remote  regions;  and  (vi)  improve  the  access  of  local  communities  to  social \nservices\u2014medical, educational, and administrative\u2014and to better job opportunities. \n \nB.   Traffic Forecasts \n \n4.  According to 1980 passenger and freight statistics, the number of domestic arrivals \narrivals and departures recorded at 17 airports amounted to more than 125,000 passengers. \nEven  though  the  traffic  figures  provide  limited  information  about  load  factors,  seasonality, \nnumber of services, and market trends, they do provide a snapshot of the size of the market and \nits development by 1980. Currently no comparable statistics are available to determine the size \nof the aviation market and the share of each airport. \n \n5.  Many observers argue that postconflict countries tend to exhibit above normal economic \ngrowth that typically peaks some time from the fourth to the seventh year of peace. The period \nof catch-up growth dissipates over time as the economy reverts to a longer-term growth rate. \nThe delayed onset of relatively high economic growth after conflict probably reflects the time \nneeded  for  business  and  investor  confidence  to  be  restored  and  for  the  institutional  and \ninfrastructure base of the economy to be rebuilt. Afghanistan\u2019s prospects for a strong economic \nrecovery look promising, even in the short run, provided that certain preconditions in relation to ", "        Appendix 10          43\nsecurity,  the  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  sound  economic  management,  and \ncontinued donor support are met. \n \n6.  Because little or no primary data are available for the postwar domestic aviation sector, \ntwo sets of surveys were conducted in June and July 2004 to obtain information from both \npassengers  using  regional  airports  and  operators  serving  such  airports.  A  team  at  Kabul \nInternational Airport surveyed all departing domestic passengers. In the case of passengers at \nother airports, one operator agreed to assist by conducting on-board surveys of passengers \ntraveling between regional airstrips and flight crews handed out and collected  questionnaires. A \npilot study was conducted in the second week of July prior to undertaking a full scale survey.   \n \n7.  The forecasting methodology used in this analysis follows that recomended by the US \nFederal Aviation Administration. It looks at aircraft movements and then uses seating capacity \nand  load  factors  to  forecast  annual  passenger  arrival  and  departure  volumes.  Data  from \npublished operator schedules, operator surveys, and historic airport movement data for Kabul \nInternational Airport were used as the primary source for establishing current levels of demand \nfor each regional airstrip. In practice, however, the number of actual flights is likely to differ from \nwhat operators publish in their timetables. This is one of the reasons for the slow development \nof the market, that is, it is due principally to operators canceling flights because of poor visibility, \nunexpected passenger cancellations and no-shows, low load factors, and security issues. \n \n8.  A draft civil aviation master plan prepared by  by ICAO provides estimates for three long-\nterm growth scenarios (high, most likely, and low) for both aircraft movements and passenger \nnumbers for regional airports based on traffic data for 1993 (raw data not provided). Two sets of \nforecasts have been developed based on a review of the ICAO estimates and discussions with \nthe Government, operators, and likely users (Table A10.1). These forecasts represent a with \nproject scenario and a without -project scenario as follows: \n  \n(i)  An unconstrained scenario in which the economy rebounds and exhibits strong \npostwar growth; the Government pushes ahead with reforms to improve the \nsector\u2019s efficiency, safety, and reliability; investment in domestic and international \nairports is a Government priority and receives support from external funding \nagencies;  and  (iv)  consumer  confidence  returns  and  operators  expand  their \ncapacity to meet demand. \n(ii)  A constrained scenario where reform of the aviation sector (including delays in \nthe  program  to  upgrade  domestic  airports)  does  not  keep  pace  with \neconomywide  infrastructure  development  in  the  major  population  centers, \nthereby affecting operator and consumer confidence. Postconflict growth is also \nsuppressed as a result of the security situation, which continues to depress \nbusiness  and  consumer  confidence  and  private  investment  in  economic \ndevelopment. Gross domestic product growth is dampened because of reduced \ninvestor interest in infrastructure development and operators postpone capacity \nexpansion. \n ", "44   Appendix 10 \nTable A10.1: Aircraft Movement Growth Projections, 2004\u20132034 \n \n  Without-Project  Scenario               With-Project Scenario \nPeriod  (%)           (%) \n     \n2004\u20132005  2   2 \n2004\u20132008  4   8 \n2009\u20132013  5  10 \n2014\u20132020  4  8 \n2021\u20132033  4  6 \n \n       Source: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \nC.  Costs \n \n9.  The financial costs of the subprojects consist of all incremental capital expenditures, but \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction.  The \nincremental operation and maintenance costs of the project facilities were estimated on the \nbasis of cost parameters developed by the consultant. The Project\u2019s economic costs include the \nresource costs for traded and nontraded costs, materials, and labor. All costs elements are \nvalued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A \nstandard conversion factor of 0.8 was applied to the financial costs of nontraded inputs to \ncalculate economic prices. Table A10.2 presents economic costs for each airport. Subproject \nfacilities are expected to have an average economic life of 30 years.  \n \nTable A10.2: Phase I Economic Costs, 2004 Market Prices  \n(AF million) \n \nCost \nAirport                    \nBamyan               180 \nChaghcharan  112 \nFaizabad  159 \nMaimana  110 \nQalai-Naw  105 \nZaranj  118 \nFarah  121 \nTotal  905 \n     Source: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \nD.  Benefits \n \n10.  The Project is aimed primarily at improving aviation operation and safety standards by \nrehabilitating existing facilities heavily damaged during the conflict period, including runways, \ntaxiways, and aprons; terminal buildings; and navigation equipment. The most important project \nbenefits would be those associated with improved aviation safety. To measure project benefits, \nthe willingness to pay approach has been applied to estimate incremental airport revenues for \nairside and landside operations. Other economic benefits considered for economic analysis are \n(i)    aircraft  operating  cost  savings  accrued  from  nonincremental  movement  of  traffic,  (ii) \npassenger time savings accrued from nonincremental movement of traffic, (iii) benefits from ", "        Appendix 10          45\nsafety  improvements,  and  (iv)  benefits  to  regional  and  local  communities  from  promoting \ntourism. A standard conversion factor of 0.8 was applied to the financial value of the benefits to \ncalculate their economic value.  \n  \n11.  The benefits to operators are substantial in terms of improvements to aircraft productivity \nfrom reduced maintenance downtime; elimination of costs associated with damage to aircraft \ncaused by flying stones from gravel runways (external instruments, wing flaps, propeller blades, \nengines); and reduced cost of tire replacement by extending the operational life of tires. Gravel \nrunways have lower coefficients of friction than bitumen runways, meaning that aircraft landing \non a gravel surface take longer to stop because of reduced braking efficiency, thus bitumen \nrunways improve fuel efficiency. The Project will also severely diminish the risk (and economic \ncosts) of accidents and other incidents caused by airstrip incursions, which are increasingly \nbecoming a safety hazard because of poor regional airstrip conditions and poor visibility. \n \n12.  Passengers will benefit from improved arrival and departure reliability, savings on travel \ntime (valued in terms of the economic value of time) and on diminished risk of flight cancellation \nor diversion, and safety improvements calculated on the basis of risk reduction of a catastrophic \naccident.1 The confidence of travelers is currently significantly affected by uncontrolled airstrips, \npoor visibility, and a poor record of on time arrivals and departures..  \n \n13.  At the regional and local community levels, other than direct labor benefits related to \nairport construction and operation, the economy could enjoy significant secound-round benefits \nfrom tourism. Calculations have assumed that airports will receive some foreign and national \ntourist traffic, though field trip observations clearly indicate that some areas have significantly \nmore  potential  for  attracting  tourists  than  others.  Consequently,  a  forecast  based  on \nconservative assumptions was developed to calculate the benefits. It is estimated that only 50 \npercent of tourism expenditure represents the real cost of consumption of locally produced \ngoods and services and return on local investments. On this basis, it is estimated that about \n$110 per tourist represents the real net benefit from tourists arriving by air. The long-term \nbenefits to the community are conservative, because they would also include the benefits from \nadditional jobs that would not be created if the airports had not been upgraded. \n \nE.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n15.  Aviation forecasts have been estimated for 30 years. The residual value after 30 years is \nassumed to be zero. The benefits and costs of the Project occur as an annual stream, occurring \nat different points in time as benefits start after expenditures have been completed\u2014in this case \n2005 for phase I projects. All costs and benefits used for the analysis of tphase I airports are in \nconstant 2004 values. \n \n16.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the seven airports varies between 18.0% \nand 28.4%, with a consolidated EIRR of 22.2%, indicating that the Project is economically viable \n(Table A10.3). The cost and benefit stream table for the consolidated EIRR is in Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Based on risk factors for different types of airstrips, the current risk of a catastrophic accident would be reduced \nfrom 10-5 to 10-7 in an operating hour, or one accident in 10 million operating hours.

In addition to the base case, the following four sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) \nthe construction costs increase by 20%, (ii) the benefits are reduced by 20%, (iii) the costs \nincrease  by  20%  and  the  benefits  are  reduced  by  20%,  and  (iv)  the  construction  period \nlengthens by 2 years. Table A10.4 summarizes the EIRRs for the base case and sensitivity \ncases.  The  Project  remains  economically  viable  under  the  adverse  scenarios  tested.  The \neconomic viability is quite robust, because the EIRR values are well above 12% in the sensitivity \nanalysis cases.  \n \nTable A10.4: Economic Internal Rate of Return Values for the Base Case and Sensitivity \nAnalysis Cases \n \nEconomic Internal \nScenario  Rate of Return (%) \n   \nBase Case  22.2 \n \nSensitivity Tests   \n1.

A risk analysis was also undertaken to estimate the limits under which the project EIRR \nwould fall below the opportunity cost of capital. Based on the analysis, it was estimated that \nconstruction costs would need to be more than 112% higher or benefits would have to be \nreduced by more than 53% over the total period of the project to have an EIRR of less than \n12%. This demonstrates, once again, the robustness of the Project. ", " Appendix 11     47\n  \n \nSHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  Regional  airports  are an  important  mode  of communication  in  Afghanistan  and  are \ngenerally  the  only  mode  whereby  the  various  international  and  national  agencies  working \ntoward  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  this  war-torn  country  can  carry  out  their \ndevelopment activities. The intent of this Project is to rehabilitate at least 18 airports in 2 \nphases. Phase I will be financed in 2004 and phase II will be taken up under loan financing in \n2006. Phase I will cover seven regional airports: Bamyan, Chaghcharan, Faizabad, Farah, \nMaymana, Qalai Naw, and Zaranj.  \n \nB.  Project Description and Impacts \n \n2.  The Project envisages the following activities: (i) developing paved runways 30 meters \nwide and 2,000 meters long; (ii) establishing graded runway strips of 90 meters and flyover \nareas outside this of up to 150 meters wherever feasible; (iii) constructing aprons and taxiways; \nand (iv) renovating or constructing passenger terminal buildings, control towers, fire stations, \nand  maintenance  garages  with  such  basic  amenities  as  electricity  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities.  \n \n3.  Most of the rehabilitation work will be carried out on land already owned by the Ministry \nof Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT), but will involve some minimal acquisition of residential \nstructures, and a few households currently cultivating Government land will suffer temporary \nlosses of income. The study included the 90 meters width required to establish a graded \nrunaway strip for assessing the Project\u2019s social impacts. All the structures and land within this \nwidth  were  examined  and  a  detailed  socio-economic  survey  was  conducted.  The  social \nassessment and public consultation has been carried out for all seven airports in phase I and a \nsample  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  at  three  regional  airports,  namely,  Bamyan, \nFaizabad,  and  Qalai-Naw.  However,  if  the  scope  of  the  Project  changes  during  detailed \nengineering design, MCAT will submit an updated resettlement plan to the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for approval prior to the award of civil works contracts.  \n \n4.  The short resettlement plan addresses the Project\u2019s impact and outlines the measures \nto be taken, including the resettlement of affected persons in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement and the Handbook on Involuntary Resettlement: A Guide to Good \nPractice.  MCAT  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  this  Project.  All  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities will be carried out prior to the award of civil works contracts.  \n \nC.  Surveys and Data Analysis \n \n5.  Social impacts are presented in Table A11.1.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "48   Appendix 11 \n \n \n \nTable A11.1: Project Impacts  \n \n  Number of  Number of  Number of Community  Extent of Land \nAirport  Structures Affected  Households Affected  Structures Affected  Acquisition \nBamyan  11  11  0  2 ha of homestead \nChaghcharan  0  0  0  land and 0.8 ha of \nFaizabad  0  5  0  government- owned \nFarah  0  0  0  agricultural land \n  \nMaymana  0  0  0 \nQalai Naw  26  25  1 mosque \nZaranj  15  15  0 \nTotal  42                 56  1  2.8 \n(196 affected \npersons) \nSource: Socio-economic Survey (SES), July 2004.  \n \n \n6.  Table A11.1 clearly shows that of the seven airports, the Project will only have land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts at four airports. It will affect 42 permanent residential \nstructures (whose owners are titleholders), as a result of which the Project will also have to \nacquire nearly 2 hectares (ha) of homestead land. In addition, 0.8 ha of agricultural land owned \nby  the  Agriculture  Department  will  have  to  be  transferred  to  MCAT.  One  mosque  will  be \naffected, and five squatter households currently cultivating Government owned agricultural land \nwill suffer income losses, but will not lose any structures. The total number of those affected is \n196 people in 56 households. \n \n7.  All the households losing residential structures claimed that they were legal titleholders, \nalthough  they  do  not  posses  any  ownership  records.  At  Qalai  Naw,  the  0.8  hectare  of \nagricultural land owned by the Agriculture Department is being used by a private agency for \nagricultural research. Consultations were carried out with the agency, and it has asked that it be \ngiven  sufficient  time  to  relocate  the  plants  and  crops  being  grown  on  this  land  before \nacquisition, but does not require any compensation for the harvest. Discussions with local \nadministrations revealed that the Government has decided to move people living in the vicinity \nof the airports for their own safety and that of aircraft. In Qalai Naw, the local administration has \nbeen giving periodic warnings and notices to people to move before any major accident or \nuntoward incident occurred because of how close to the runway they live. In Bamyan, public \nconsultations revealed that plans had already been made to move the settlement near the \nrunway and compensation negotiations had been completed, but because of a lack of funds, \nthe  local  administration  was  delaying  the  payment  of  compensation.  Under  this  Project, \nhouseholds holding titles that lose residential structures will be relocated only after the payment \nof full compensation for their structures and land according to the Land Acquisition Act and prior \nto the award of civil works contracts. \n \nD.  Income Level and Occupational Profile of Affected Persons  \n \n8.  The survey revealed that 23% of households have an income of less than AF2,000 per \nmonth, while 40% have an income of AF2,000 to AF3,000 per month and 25% have more than \nAF3,000 per month. Because of the lack of employment opportunities during the war years and \ndrought in the last couple of years, poverty levels have risen rapidly. The poverty line the United \nNations has adopted for Afghanistan is $1 per person per day. About 23% of the families \ncontacted during the social survey fall below this minimum subsistence level. Those families \nwith an income between AF2,000 and AF3,000 per month can also be considered as falling into \n  ", " Appendix 11     49\n  \n \nthis category as they do not have continuous employment for the whole year. Thus more than \n60% of the affected families fall below the poverty line.  \n \n9.  In terms of the occupational profile of those affected, 3% of affected persons worked as \nagricultural laborers and 26% were nonagricultural laborers, while the remainder were involved \nin businesses or worked for private companies or the government. Among women, the most \ncommon occupation was working as servants, although the proportion working was extremely \nlow. The women in the affected families generally do not work outside the home. The group \ndiscussion in Bamyan revealed that the women wanted the airport to be better than it is today. \nThey believe that if the airport is improved, it will bring in more flights, which would enhance \nbusiness in the region, giving their families better employment opportunities, and therefore \nincreased incomes.  \n \nE.  Relocation Options \n \n10.  Those affected by the Project have indicated that they would like to self-relocate and \nonly requested that they be given appropriate compensation or assistance so that they can buy \nland of equivalent value or build an equivalent type of house wherever they relocate. The \nsquatter farmers in Faizabad have asked for advance notice or appropriate compensation for \nany  loss  of  crops.  Those  affected  have  noted  that  they  would  be  happy  if  employment \nopportunities  could  be  provided  during  project  development  and  in  future  activities  at  the \nairports. The process of self-relocation and payment of compensation to households losing \nresidential  structures  will  be  carefully  monitored  by  MCAT  with  the  assistance  of  the \nnongovernment organization (NGO) implementing the resettlement plan. \n \nF.  Policy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n \n11.  The  policy  framework  is  based  on  the  laws  and  practices  of  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  The  resettlement  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A11.2) \nrecognizes different types of losses associated with dislocation and resettlement, namely, loss \nof residential structures, religious structures, trees, crops, community structures, and agriculture \nland. The land acquisition will be carried out based on Afghanistan\u2019s Land Acquisition Law. \nFollowing current practice, the compensation will be provided at rates set by the Government. If \nland and property are acquired, the owner gets compensation to cover the value of the land; the \nvalue of residential houses and buildings; and the value of trees, orchards, and other assets on \nthe land. The act also states that a person who loses a residential land plot will receive a new \nplot of land of the same value. If people wish, they can get a residence or house on government \nproperty  in  exchange  under  proper  procedures.  Under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  the \nGovernment or local municipality will set up a committee that will be responsible for the land \nacquisition. The committee will consist of the landlord or the person who uses the land or his or \nher representative, the local MCAT representative, a representative of the municipality, the local \nrepresentative of the Ministry of Finance, and the local representative of the Ministry of Justice. \nAt the central level, MCAT will monitor the land acquisition through the Project Implementation \nUnit (PIU).  \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "50   Appendix 11 \n \n \n \nTable A11.2: Resettlement Entitlement Matrix \n \nDefinition of  Expected \nType of Loss  Application  Entitlement \nAffected Persons  Results  \nLoss of residential  Structure within 90  Owner(s) of  (cid:131)  Replacement value of structure  Reconstruction \nstructure by  meters of a  structures identified  at market price   of structure at a \nowners   runway strip and  by the socio- (cid:131)  AF2,000 as shifting allowance  new site \nwithin the project  economic survey  or provide transportation for \narea   shifting to the new self-\nrelocation site/structure \n(cid:131)  Salvage materials free of cost \nLoss of residential  Structure within 90  Owners extending   (cid:131)  Replacement value of structure  Compensation \nstructure by  meters of a  property or using  on Government land at market  for lost \nencroachers   runway strip and  public land as  price  structure  \nwithin the project  identified by joint  (cid:131)  AF2,000 as shifting allowance \narea  verification during  or provide transportation for \ndetailed design and  shifting to the new self-\nimplementation  relocation site/structure \n(cid:131)  Salvage materials free of cost \nLoss of  Standing  Owners of trees,  (cid:131)  Advance notice to harvest  Compensation \ntrees/crops  trees/crops within  perennials and  crops.  for trees, \nthe 90 meters  squatter farmers  (cid:131)  In case of standing crops and  perennials and \nwidth  (not losing  trees, compensation at the rate  standing crops \nstructures)  estimated by the Agriculture \nDepartment \n(cid:131)  Salvage materials free of cost \n Loss of  Structure/plot  Owner(s) of   (cid:131)  Replacement value of plot/land  Purchase of \nresidential land by  owners   structures identified  area at market price  land for \nstructure owners  within 90 meters  by   (cid:131)  Fees and charges for  construction of \nof a   the socio-economic  registration or transfer of  a new structure \nrunway strip   survey  ownership  \nDisplacement of  Religious or  Religious head,  (cid:131)  Replacement value of structure  Restoration of \nreligious or  community  religious  at market price   religious or \ncommunity  structures within  committee, or  (cid:131)  AF2,000 as a shifting  community \nstructure  90 meters of a  community  allowance for relocation of  the  structure  \nrunway strip, if   representative as  structure \nremoved for  identified   (cid:131)  Plot as decided by the religious \nProject interest   during the   body, the local religious head, \n  Socio-economic  or the religious committee \nSurvey   (cid:131)  Dismantling and reconstruction \ncash assistance as per \nassessed value by the \ncommittee for assessing the \nstructure. \nLoss of access to  Agriculture,  Agriculture  (cid:131)  Government land to be  Restoration of \nagriculture land  horticulture, etc.,  Department,   transferred between  land for \nwithin 90 meters  private developers,  departments, private  replantation by \nof a runway strip  others  developers to be provided with  the \nappropriate compensation for  Government \nthe standing crops, allocate  and private \nsimilar Government land for  developers  \ndevelopment to private \ndevelopers \nSpecial  Households within  Affected persons  (cid:131)  Lump sum assistance of  Income \nassistance to  90 meters of a  living below the  AF2,000 for 1 month  restoration \nvulnerable groups  runway strip  poverty line  (cid:131)  Employment in construction  assistance \nactivities \n \n12.

Those people who are unable to show title to the land or \nto the structure they are using shall be legally considered as the occupiers of the land or structure \nand considered for compensation and assistance under the Project.  \n \nG.  Consultation Meetings and Stakeholder Participation \n \n13.  Project  development  and  activities  were  discussed  with  local  communities  during \nconsultation meetings at the sample project sites. The discussions were held with all the primary \nstakeholders  (those  directly  affected  by  the  Project),  with  secondary  stakeholders  (local \nadministrations,  etc.),  and  with  various  other  international  and  local  agencies  involved  in \nrehabilitation and reconstruction in Afghanistan. The directly affected populations were consulted to \ngain an understanding of their concerns in relation to the Project and to gather suggestions on the \ntypes of mitigation measures that should be considered to address the envisaged impacts. The \nconsultations and discussions with those affected will be continued throughout the implementation \nof the Project. During implementation, MCAT will be assisted in conducting the consultations by the \nNGO that will be contracted for resettlement plan implementation. The short resettlement plan will \nbe  translated  into  local  language  (Dari)  and  disclosed to affected persons and will be made \navailable in local MCAT offices, ADB\u2019s Resident Mission in Afghanistan, and on ADB\u2019s web site. \nThe NGO will keep those affected informed about the Project\u2019s impacts and the compensation and \nassistance proposed for them and will help them deal with any grievances. The affected persons \nwill participate in all the decisions and  in the  implementation of  the resettlement plan. Affected \npersons will also be involved in the grievance redress committees set up to review and resolve any \ndisputes  about  compensation  and  other  resettlement  benefits.  Finally,  continuous  on-site \nconsultation will take place during the implementation stage to ensure that the  affected persons \nreceive their proper entitlements.  \n \nH.  Implementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates \n \n14.  MCAT, through its PIU, will be responsible for implementing the resettlement plan. The PIU \nwill be headed by a project director and will appoint an NGO to implement the resettlement plan \nand carry out the relocation and rehabilitation based on the choices of those affected. The PIU\u2019s \nsocial development officer will monitor the  implementation of the  resettlement plan. The social \ndevelopment officer will have at least a master\u2019s degree in a social science, preferably sociology or \neconomics. The officer should have at least 1 or 2 years of experience in working on infrastructure \ndevelopment  projects  involving  resettlement  and  rehabilitation.  If  the  PIU  is  unable  to  locate \nsomeone with these qualifications, it should identify  an ideal candidate  from within MCAT and \nprovide appropriate training to handle the social issues during the resettlement plan implementation \nand post implementation periods. The appointed NGO will generally have staff located at the airport \nsites for carrying out the implementation of the RP.  \n \n15.  PIU officials and NGO staff will undergo a week of training on ADB\u2019s policy on resettlement, \nresettlement management, and implementation. The PIU will have to constitute a grievance redress \ncommittee following loan negotiations that will comprise (i) a representative of the affected persons, \n(ii) a representative of the local administration (the chief administrator from the governor\u2019s office), \n(iii) a representative from the municipality, and (iv) a representative from the local legal department. \nAny grievances will be brought before a committee and a decision has to be taken within 7 to 10 \n   ", "52   Appendix 11 \n \n \n \nworking days. If any committee members are absent during the decisionmaking process, they will \nnominate an appropriate person to take their place.  \n \n16.  The estimated cost of relocation and resettlement is  AF7,853,023 or $0.17 million. The \ncompensation and assistance have been calculated based on  information gathered during the \nsocial surveys and from local administration officials and the project affected community. The unit \nvalues have been drawn from consultations carried out with various stakeholders. The PIU will \nensure  that  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  implementing  NGO  for  timely \nimplementation of the  resettlement plan.  Individual entitlements on  a household  basis  will  be \nprocessed by the NGO based on confirmed Socio-economic Survey (SES)  data. Each entitled \nperson will receive an identity card. The implementation of this short  resettlement plan will be \ncompleted  in  12  months  from  households  receiving  notice  that  they  must  relocate,  and  all \nhouseholds will receive the compensation and assistance due to them 3 months prior to relocation.  \n \nI.  Monitoring Arrangements \n \n17.  MCAT will supervise and monitor implementation of the short resettlement plan through the \nPIU social development officer. The social development officer will report to ADB on a quarterly \nbasis during the resettlement plan implementation period. The monitoring report will deal with all \naspects of the relocation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of households. The NGO implementing \nthe resettlement plan will conduct field-level monitoring, assess progress in the field on a monthly \nbasis, and prepare a monthly report for the social development officer. A complete status report on \nresettlement plan implementation will be prepared by the social development officer and submitted \nto ADB at the end of  the implementation of the  resettlement plan. The report will reflect on the \nresettlement experience and on lessons learned for improved management of resettlement in future \nprojects.  \n  ", "                                             Appendix 12         53 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS) FORM \n  \n A.

No  partnership agreement?                                    No \n   \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan? \nThe prolonged state of conflict in Afghanistan has resulted in large-scale deterioration of the civil aviation infrastructure and \ndepletion of skilled personnel. In addition to a lack of maintenance, the deterioration was further accelerated by the heavy \ndamage inflicted by the prolonged civil strife and military operations. Afghanistan relies significantly on the civil aviation \nsector for keeping most of its remote communities within reach of much needed humanitarian aid and basic public services. \nRehabilitation and strengthening of the civil aviation sector is crucial in extending the reach of the Government in Kabul to \nfacilitate stabilization and integration of the country. Rehabilitation of the civil aviation infrastructure is a prerequisite for \nprivate sector service providers to provide efficient and affordable means of transport to most of the population living in \nremote, rural provinces. Rehabilitation of the airports will also contribute to employment creation, income generation at the \nhousehold level, improvements in safety, improvements in the spread of medical facilities, interethnic reconciliation, and \npolitical unification of the country. To the extent possible, the Project will use labor-intensive construction methods to \nprovide much needed employment and income generation opportunities. It will contribute to social stability and poverty \nreduction by engaging internally displaced by the war and civil unrest. Thus this investment will significantly improve the \nsocioeconomic situation, and help mitigate the pervasive poverty. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                                                         Poverty Intervention \nPhase I of the project will cover seven regional airports in the provinces of Badakhshan, Bagdis, Bamyan, Farah, Faryab, \nGhor, and Nimroz with a total population of about 3,201,000. Of the seven airports, Maimana is the major economic center \nand has the largest population, while Qalai-Naw has the lowest. Nationally, approximately 53% of the population is \nclassified as poor and living on less than $1 per day or approximately 2,100 kilocalories per day. In the project provinces, \nthe average daily income is less than $1, no more than $0.74 per person per day, compared with the national average \nincome of an unskilled laborer of $1.7 to $3.2 per day. The prolonged war, further exasperated by drought, has severely \naffected people\u2019s livelihoods. The decline in farm productivity and the loss of seasonal opportunities for agricultural labor is \none of the main determinants of poverty, because unskilled labor is often piecemeal over time or seasonal as opposed to a \nregular income source over the year. The social assessment in the project area also revealed that 50% to 60% of residents \nlived below the poverty line and had an average income of AF2,000 to AF3,000  per month. Thus poverty levels are high in \nthe project provinces.  \n \nDemographic health indicators of poverty reveal that Afghanistan ranks fourth highest in the mortality rate for children under \n5 at 257 deaths per 1,000 and has a high infant mortality rate of 165 per 1,000.1 In the phase 1 provinces, the maternal \nmortality rate is an extremely high 820 per 100,000 live births, and average life expectancy is just 44 years, compared to 60 \nto 75 years in neighboring countries. Access to reproductive health services for mothers is extremely limited. More than \n70% of deliveries are at home. Basic health center facilities are generally more concentrated in Badakhshan than in the \nother provinces. The facilities within the basic health centers are extremely poor because of the prolonged disturbances and \nthe out-migration of medical personnel. In addition, nearly 99% of the households in the project provinces lack sanitary \nfacilities, most resort to unsafe sources of water, and adult literacy ranges from 15% among the male population to less \nthan 7% among the female population. \n \nThe project would have both direct and indirect poverty reduction impacts. The direct poverty impact would be on income \ngeneration and the demand for unskilled labor. The direct benefit to poor households will be employment in construction of \nairstrip perimeter fences, terminal buildings, and other passenger facilities in terms of net income earned during the period \nof the project. Expectations are that this additional income will be spent within families on education, nutrition, agricultural \nimplements, seed, and fertilizer, which will benefit families and communities through surplus crops and improve their \nincome levels. The Project will generate 380 person-months of employment opportunities for unskilled labor. Both poor and \nnon-poor households are likely to benefit directly in the medium and long term, as additional jobs will be created in airport \nadministration and management and in the tourist industry. Employment opportunities will also be created in fire fighting \nservices, catering, private airline services, and car hire services for business travelers and tourists and within small and \nlarge contractor firms that will be responsible for the operations and maintenance of the airports in the future. \n \n                                                 \n1   United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2004. State of the World\u2019s Children. New York. ", "54  Appendix 12   \n \n \nAn indirect, but important, impact will be provision of the much needed humanitarian aid and basic public services to remote \nregions that might be devastated by natural disasters, famine, epidemics, and the like and evacuation of the sick and \ninjured. Remote areas that are not well connected by land transport would be linked and receive fast, comfortable, and \nconvenient connections between the capital, Kabul, and other centers of commerce, administration, and tourism. The \nProject will also facilitate access to regional and international markets for agricultural, livestock, and other products; \nfacilitate regional trade; and stimulate the growth of local trade and enterprises, thereby generating additional employment \nopportunities. Air cargo will enable the delivery of urgent supplies and the export of high\u2013value, low-volume manufactured \nor perishable products to both national and international markets. The construction of controlled airstrips will reduce aircraft \noperating costs and pass significant benefits on to airline operators in terms of flexibility in the types of aircraft operated, \nhigher payloads, and improved safety. The Project will also attract investment from private airlines and bring new business \nand employment opportunities to the areas, especially opportunities related to tourism.  \n \nIn addition, the rehabilitation of regional airports will result in improved service frequency and reliability, leading to greater \nuse of domestic airline services, and passengers  will save time in transit leading to savings in travel time. Local \ncommunities served by regional or private airline operators would receive tourism benefits (hotel occupancy, car hire, local \ncraft industries, tour guides, etc.); improved connections to markets (where they can obtain higher prices for outputs and \npay less for inputs); and improved connections to social services (medical, educational, and administrative) and remote \nregions (improvements in productive capability and increased self-reliance). \n \n \nC.     Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No \n \nDuring the course of social analysis, consultations with various project stakeholders, including those potentially affected by \nthe Project, were organized to ascertain their acceptance of the rehabilitation of the airports and their opinions and views \nabout the Project. In addition to public meetings, focus group discussions were organized with people living in the vicinity of \nthe airport and along the runway strips, including with women\u2019s groups, to comprehend the various social issues, both \npositive and adverse. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?

They lack decisionmaking authority in major household \nand other economic activities. The proposed airport rehabilitation will benefit both men and women.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project is classified as a \u201cB\u201d category project in \n \naccordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  2003  environmental  assessment \nguidelines.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  study  was  undertaken  during  June\u2013\nAugust 2004. This summary IEE is based on the IEE report for the Project prepared by the \ninternational technical assistance consultants (SMEC International Pty. Ltd., Australia), which \n \nwere retained by ADB to assist the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT) as part of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance funded by ADB. \n \nB.   Description of the Project \n \n2.  The  project  area  is  located  in  seven  different  provinces  spread  across  seven  of \nAfghanistan\u2019s eight regions, including (i) northeast, (ii) north, (iii) west;  (iv) central,  (v) east \ncentral,  (vi) southwest, and (vii) south.1   \n \n3.  The  Project  involves  rehabilitating  seven  airports  across  Afghanistan  at  Bamyan, \nChaghcharan,  Faizabad,  Farah,  Maimana,  Qalai-Naw,  and  Zaranj.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 2.5 years commencing in April 2005. The project activities will \ninvolve (i) reconstructing the runways (about 2,000 meters x 30 meters) with an asphalted \nconcrete wearing course; (ii) constructing new taxiways and aprons with an asphalted concrete \nwearing course; (iii) widening runway strips to 90 meters graded width, including drainage as \nrequired;  (iv)  constructing,  rehabilitating,  or  renovating  existing  passenger  terminals  and \nproviding water supply and sanitation facilities; (v) providing new powerhouses and generators; \n(vi) providing apron security fences and gates; (vii) providing two wind indicators; (viii)  providing \nairport maintenance buildings and equipment; (ix) constructing boundary fences; (x) providing \nnew  fire  stations  and  equipment  (category  4);  and  (xi)  providing  two  fire  tenders  to  meet \ncategory 4 requirements.  \n \nC.   Description of the Environment \n \n4.   The general topography of most of the airports sites is rolling to hilly except in Maimana \nand Zaranj, where the terrain around the airports is almost flat.  The soil type in and around the \nairports is generally sandy loam to sandy silt. The general land use around the project airports \nconsists of agriculture and horticulture (Qalai-Naw); residential areas (Bamyan, Qalai-Naw, and \nZaranj); and military camps (Bamyan and Qalai-Naw). Limited encroachments are also apparent \nat least at one of the phase I airports (Faizabad). All but Farah and Zaranj airports are located \nfrom 50 to 500 meters of rivers. \n \n5.   As there is no major source of air pollution, the ambient air quality at all these airports is \nconsidered good. The ambient noise levels are also reported to be within acceptable levels. \n \n                                                 \n1 The United Nations has defined eight regions for its assistance planning: (i)northeast\u2014Badakhshan, Baghlan, \nKunduz, Takhar;(ii) north\u2014Balkh, Jawzjan, Samangan, Saripul;(iii) west\u2014Badghis, Farah, Faryab, Herat; (iv)east \n(v)  central\u2014Bamyan,  Ghor;  central\u2014Kabul,  Kapisa,  Logar,  Parwan,  Wardak;(vi)  east\u2014Kunar,  Laghman, \nNangarhar, Nuristan; (vii) south\u2014Ghazni, Khost,  Pakteka, Paktya;(viii) southwest\u2014Hilmand, Kandahar, Nimroz,  \nUruzgan, Zabul.   \n ", "                    Appendix 13               57\n6.   There  is  no  environmentally  sensitive  area  (cultural  heritage  site,  protected  area, \nprotected wetland, mangrove, estuarine, buffer zone of a protected area, or a biodiversity \nconservation area) near any of these airports. \n \nD.   Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7.   The location of the Project will have no significant environmental impact, because the \nProject will be executed only on existing and already operational airports, none of which are \nlocated in an environmentally sensitive area. The project design will have no significant negative \nimpacts as long as the Project adheres to good construction practices and fully implements the \nmitigation measures and environmental management plan. However, the Project will involve \nclearing about 750 Afghan pistachio, walnut, almond, and pine trees (mostly at Qalai-Naw) ) and \n7 hectares of horticulture areas growing mainly Afghan pistachio, walnut, almond, and pine \ntrees; Iranian quince, sunflower, and cabbage; Brazilian cotton; and Australian corn species to \nobtain the designed runway strip width of 150 meters. This needs to be compensated for by \nplanting and maintaining two sapling for each tree cleared for a reasonable period at designated \nlocations. \n \n8.  Minor  and  short-term  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  during  the  construction \nstage. The short-term and manageable potential environmental impacts associated with the \nconstruction stage will include (i) increased air pollution due to dust and other volatile chemical \nsubstances resulting from the operations of asphalt plants, (ii) disturbances from noise and \nvibration, (iii) impacts related to the location and operation of construction camps and borrowed  \nand quarry areas, (iv) soil erosion and downstream sedimentation caused by earthworks, and \n(v) social conflicts between local laborers and those from outside the area. Mitigation measures \nto minimize these impacts will need to be adopted, including (i) maintaining optimum moisture \ncontent  during  the  handling  of  soil,  spraying  water  to  minimize  dust  as  necessary,  and \nmaintaining a safe distance between asphalt plants and residential areas; (ii) strictly controlling \nconstruction work that creates noise and vibration by prohibiting night-time work in residential \nareas; (iii) ensuring environmentally sound management of construction camps, vehicle yards, \nand borrowed and quarry areas; (iv) providing temporary sedimentation traps at the outfalls of \ndrainage channels and ditches if erosion is likely; and (v) establishing a mechanism in the \ncontract conditions to maximize the employment of local labor. All these impacts are temporary \nand manageable. Nonetheless, all the mitigation measures and requirements will be included in \nthe bidding and contract documents for the contractors and will be closely monitored by the \nproject manager.2 The limited amount of earthwork, ground preparation, asphalt work, runway \nconstruction,  building,  rehabilitation,  etc.,  are  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  the  local \nenvironment. The Project\u2019s estimated daily water requirement of about 25 Kilo liter would not \nsignificantly affect the supply of water to the residents of project towns.  \n \n9.  There will hardly be any fire hazard, because no combustible materials will be used and \nno fires will be ignited. Solid waste generated by some 50 workers at each site, as well as solid \nwaste from construction activities, will be disposed of daily by the contractors in collaboration \nwith municipal staff. \n \n10.  Improved runways will have a positive impact on local ambient air quality because of the \nreduction in dust during landings and takeoffs. The Project will also enhance aviation safety, \nvisual aesthetics, and economic activities in the region. The provision of water supply and \nsanitation facilities will improve overall environmental sanitation at the airports. \n                                                 \n2 The IEE report will be provided to prospective contractors and will be attached to the contract document.  ", "58   Appendix 13 \n \n11.  The potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the Project are mainly the \nrisk of accidents and the noise nuisance to local people during landing and take-off operations. \nThe  additional  aircraft  movements  will  slightly  increase  the  present  ambient  noise  level; \nhowever, given the level and extent of flight services expected during the project design period \nof 10 years, the noise impacts are expected to be insignificant. Moreover, flights are normally \nscheduled during the daytime to minimize noise disruption to settlements. The diesel-operated \ngenerator  sets  could  also  contribute  to  the  ambient  noise  levels  should  noise  mufflers \nmalfunction. All the generators will be fitted with pollution control devices. Thus the impacts \ncaused by the marginal and short duration increase in noise levels will not affect local residents \nsignificantly. \n \n12.  The estimated water requirement of 10 Kilo liter per day will be met from groundwater. \nThe limited quantity of water withdrawal is not expected to adversely affect the water needs of \nlocal communities; however, the wastewater generated might contain oil wastes, therefore oil \ntraps will be installed in all drainage outlets.  \n \n13.  During  the  operation  of  terminal  buildings,  building  and  fire  codes  will  be  strictly \nenforced. Fire extinguishers will be provided at all the airports. \n \n14.  New refueling stations at Bamyan and Faizabad will be constructed and operated with \nstandard operating procedures to ensure that no leakage or spillage of fuel will occur. To \nprevent potential contamination, oil traps will be installed in the outlets of all drainage alongside \nrefueling sites. \n \nE.   Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n15.  MCAT will be the overall responsible entity for ensuring that mitigation measures are \nimplemented. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), especially constituted within MCAT to \nimplement  the  Project,  will  help  MCAT  supervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental monitoring plan. The implementation of mitigation measures during construction \nwill be the responsibility of the contractors. An environmental and social specialist will help the \nPIU prepare the contract documentation so that the bidding documents, bill of quantities, and \nother  contractual  obligations  of  the  contractors  identify  their  environmental  management \nresponsibilities and stipulate penalties for noncompliance. In addition, the project manager will \nalso be required to assist the implementing agency in monitoring the implementation of the \nenvironmental monitoring plan. \n \n16.  The supervision plan for the proposed Project will include provisions for participation by \nADB  environmental  staff  in  supervision  missions,  as  appropriate  and  subject  to  available \nfunding,  to  review  progress  in  implementing  the  environmental  monitoring  plan.  The \nperformance  of  the  PIU  in  implementing  these  activities  will  be  a  standard  element  of \nsupervision mission reports, including those from the early implementation assessment and the \nImplementation  Completion  Mission.  Contractors  will  submit  monthly  and  quarterly \nenvironmental monitoring reports to the project manager, who in turn will submit consolidated \nquarterly reports to MCAT and ADB. The IEE includes a detailed environmental monitoring plan. \n \n17.  The  training  component  of  the  Project  will  include  an  environmental  training  and \ninstitutional strengthening plan to build environmental management capacity and mainstream \nenvironmental considerations into all policy and operation functions of MCAT. \n ", "                    Appendix 13               59\n18.  The total estimated cost of implementing the environmental monitoring plan has been \ncalculated as $0.28 million. The proposed monitoring plan includes monitoring the water quality \nof  drainage  from  project  areas  with  a  focus  on  BOD  (Biological  Oxygen  Demand)    COD \n(Chemical Oxygen Demand),  oil and grease, TSS (Total Suspended Solid) and air quality (SPM \n(Suspended  Particulate  Matter),  PAHs  (Polycyclic  Aromatic  Hydrocarbons),  NOx  (Nitrogen \nOxide), SO2 (Sulphur Dioxide)  prior to starting the work; monitoring the implementation of \nmitigation measures and water and air quality during the construction period and water and air \nquality; and continued monitoring of air and water quality and noise levels following project \ncompletion.   \n \nF.   Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n19.  During project preparation, five levels of consultations were undertaken using a public \ninformation consultation tool. The first level was in Kabul at the national capital level with various \nfunding  agencies,  research  agencies,  relevant  international  and  local  nongovernment \norganizations, and relevant ministries and Government departments. The second level was at \nthe  provincial  level  with  provincial  heads,  local  administrations,  municipalities,  agriculture \ndepartments,  legal  departments,  airport  authorities,  cadastral  departments,  and  relevant \ninternational  and  local  nongovernment  organizations.  The  third  level  was  with  community \nleaders  and  local  educated  people  primarily  to  solicit  information  about  natural  resources, \ncommunity  facilities,  and  likely  impacts  of  the  Project.  The  fourth  level  was  with  affected \ncommunities. The fifth level included consultation with people potentially affected by the Project, \nincluding  women  members  of  affected  families  on  an  individual  level.  Prior  to  these \nconsultations, relevant information, such as a description of the Project and its objectives and \nan explanation of possible adverse effects of the proposed Project, were disseminated in a form \nand language meaningful to the groups consulted. \n \n20.  Major  perceived  benefits  as  identified  during  the  community  consultations  were  (i) \nreduced travel time; (ii) better access to public amenities; (iii) significant economic opportunities \nresulting from increased access to markets; (iv) benefits to local businesses from increased air \ntraffic; and (v) increased regional development in terms of industry, tourism, and development of \ncrafts industries. The major perceived losses include (i) loss of residential and agricultural \nproperties; (ii) safety risks posed by increased numbers of aircraft; (iv) children\u2019s loss of playing \nareas following the fencing of airports; and (v) increased noise pollution. The results from the \ncommunity consultation were taken into account during project planning and were incorporated \ninto the preparation of the resettlement plan as well as the preparation of mitigation measures.  \n \nG.   Findings and Recommendations \n \n21.  The  initial  findings  of  the  IEE  study  show  that  the  negative  environmental  impacts \nassociated with the rehabilitation of the regional airports are deemed to be minor and the \nmitigation measures will be incorporated into the contract document for the contractors. All the \nproposed  mitigation  measures  for  all  project  components  are  manageable,  and  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment to assess further impacts of the Project is not required. \n \nH.   Conclusion \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \n22.  The Project is classified as an environmental category \u201cB\u201d project, as it is unlikely to \nhave  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  Project  will  generate  social  and \nenvironmental  benefits,  particularly  in  terms  of  enhancing  the  environmental  and  safety ", "60   Appendix 13 \n \nperformance of improved runways, alleviating dust at the airports, providing water and sanitation \nfacilities at the airports, and providing warning system and aviation aids. Implementation of the \nproposed Project will provide the country with facilities that could adequately accommodate \nabout 10,000 passengers annually by the end of the first 10 years and is expected to increase \nthe tourism potential of the country. Direct employment opportunities that will be generated from \nthe proposed Project are estimated to be 1,000 people during construction and 50 people during \noperations. In addition, several indirect benefits will accrue to users, the business community, \nthe poor, aircraft operators, and suppliers of various goods and services. The Project will \nespecially benefit women through the provision of an improved, secure, and efficient mode of \ntransportation in comparison with road transportation. Nonetheless, the residents of nearby \nsettlements will be subjected to both temporary and permanent marginal increases in noise \nlevels, which in terms of level, time of occurrence, and distribution will not be significant. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041126094535+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041102192218+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R220-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "ADB", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \n \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 October 2004) \n  \n \nCurrency Unit   \u2013  afghani (AF) \n$1.00  =  AF42.7 \nAF1.00  =  $0.023 \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB    \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nADF    \u2013  Asian Development Fund \nARDS   \u2013  Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services \nEIRR    \u2013  economic internal rate of return \nFIRR    \u2013  financial internal rate of return \nICAO    \u2013  International Civil Aviation Organization  \nIEE    \u2013  initial environmental examination \nMOF    \u2013  Ministry of Finance \nMCAT   \u2013  Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism \nMOPW   \u2013  Ministry of Public Works \nNGO    \u2013  nongovernment organization \nPacTec  \u2013  Partners in Aviation Communications and Technology   \nPIU  \u2013  project implementation unit \nPRR  \u2013  Priority Reform and Restructuring  \nPSC    \u2013  project steering committee \nSDR    \u2013  special drawing rights \nTSR  \u2013  transport sector review \nTA  \u2013  technical assistance \nUNAMA  \u2013  United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan  \nUNHAS  \u2013  United Nations Humanitarian Air Services  \nUNODC  \u2013  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes  \nUNOPS  \u2013  United Nations Office of Project Services \nWACC   \u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 19 \nMarch.
