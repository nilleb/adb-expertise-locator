The Project has two parts. Part\nA  consists  of  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  including\nconstruction of sewer mains and pump stations connected to a\ntreatment plant in the Beicang area. Part B consists of protecting\nTianjin\u2019s sole raw water supply, including the watershed of the\nYuqiao  Reservoir;  a  dedicated  34-kilometer  closed  conduit\ndownstream to avoid the pollution in the passage through the\nZhou  River;  and  improvements  to  the  existing  open  channel\nfurther downstream.\nClassification Primary: Environment\nSecondary: Human Development\nEnvironmental\nAssessment Category  A.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was\nundertaken and the summary EIA was circulated to the Board on\n28 February 2000.\nRationale Tianjin, the PRC\u2019s fourth largest city, has 9.6 million people and is\na municipality with the status of a province, similar to Beijing,\nChongqing, and Shanghai. A high priority in Tianjin\u2019s development\nas  a  major  industrial  center  has  been  to  improve  the  urban\nenvironment in the densely settled city center, including relocating\nindustry, promoting new industrial developments, and encouraging\nthe development of clean and high-technology industry. More than\nhalf of Tianjin\u2019s wastewater is discharged untreated into canals,\nrivers, and Bohai Bay. Increasing pollution in the Hai River Basin\nthreatens the city\u2019s sole raw water supply. If left unchecked, the\npollution  may  have  catastrophic  consequences  on  economic\ngrowth  and  the  health  and  well-being  of  Tianjin\u2019s  populace.\nContinued  sustainable  economic  growth  is  required  to  help\nalleviate  increasing  urban  poverty.  Attention  must  be  given  to\nimproved wastewater management and environmental protection\nof the city's raw water source for such growth to be sustainable.\nThe  Project  addresses  two  high-priority  components  in  the\nwastewater  and  water  resources  sectors.  (i)  The  Beicang\nwastewater  treatment  (WWT)  component  will  enhance  urban\nenvironmental  and  public  health  conditions,  contribute  to  a\ncomprehensive  wastewater  management  program  for  the  Hai\nRiver Basin, and help mitigate the pollution loading in Bohai Bay,\na key marine and fisheries resource that increasingly suffers from\nred tide and other effects of untreated wastewater effluent. (ii) The\nwater  resources  protection  (WRP)  component  will  address  the\nsingle raw water supply source, the Luan-Tianjin water diversion\nsystem, which serves 5 million people who are currently at risk", "iii\nfrom increasing pollution. The WRP component will eliminate the\nsources  of  pollution  to  the  raw  water  system  that  are  within\nTianjin's  control,  and  lend  credibility  to  Tianjin's  demands  for\npollution  control  of  the  upstream  pollution  sources  in  Hebei\nProvince.  The  WRP  component  also  incorporates  the  best\npractices for comprehensive watershed management within the\nYuqiao Reservoir watershed, and will reduce the future pollution\nrisks to a more manageable level. The Project is an important\ncomponent of a comprehensive approach to address pollution in\nthe Hai River Basin, which will serve as a model for replication in\nthe PRC.\nObjectives and\nScope The main objectives of the Project are to improve (i) the urban\nenvironment  by  reducing  environmental  contamination  through\nimproved  wastewater  management,  and  (ii)  the  quality  of  raw\nwater supply in Tianjin. Related objectives include strengthening\nthe capacity of the raw water supply and wastewater operations to\nbe  more  efficient  and  managed  on  commercial  principles,\nintroducing comprehensive watershed management approaches,\nand improving cost recovery from users through an improved tariff\nstructure with gradual increases to achieve full cost recovery.\nCost Estimates The  total  project  cost  is  $340.7  million  equivalent,  including  a\nforeign exchange cost of $169.2 million (49 percent) and a local\ncurrency cost of $171.5 million equivalent (51 percent).\nFinancing Plan ($ million equivalent)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percentage\nExchange Currency Financing\nA.

The loan proceeds will be\nrelent  by  the  central  Government  to  the  Tianjin  Municipal\nGovernment (TMG) on the same terms and conditions as the ADB\nloan. TMG will onlend the loan proceeds to the Tianjin Sewerage\nCompany (TSC) and the Tianjin Municipal Luanhe Drinking Water\nSource  Protection  Engineering,  Ltd  (TML)  through  onlending\nterms and agreements on the same terms and conditions as the", "iv\nADB loan. The two companies will assume the foreign exchange\nand interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan while TMG will\nassume the intermediation and transaction costs.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2006\nExecuting Agency   Tianjin Municipal Government \nImplementation\nArrangements The  Tianjin  Municipal  Development  Planning  Commission\n(TMDPC), under the overall direction and guidance of the TMG\nleading group headed by the deputy executive mayor of Tianjin,\nwill coordinate project implementation work through various design\ninstitutes and the Project\u2019s Implementation Agencies. TSC and\nTML will be responsible for day-to-day project management.\nProcurement ADB-financed  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major\ncontracts for equipment and materials will be tendered through\ninternational  competitive  bidding  or  international  shopping\nprocedures, depending on the contract amount. In accordance with\nADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in the bidding\nfor local competitive bidding contracts.\nConsulting Services About 65 person-months of international and 130 person-months\nof  domestic  consulting  will  be  required,  with  expertise  in\ninternational  competitive  bidding  and  international  shopping\nprocedures, including international specifications, bid evaluation,\ncontracts, quality control, and project performance management\nsystems.  The  consultants  will  provide  guidance  and  training  for\ncapacity building to ensure that (i) the two Implementing Agencies\nare  able  to  function  as  effective  project  management  units;  (ii)\nappropriate  institutional,  managerial,  financial,  and  operational\narrangements are in place to enhance operational effectiveness,\nmanagement  efficiency,  and  financial  sustainability;  (iii)  the\nImplementation  Agencies  are  converted  from  construction  into\noperating companies upon completion of implementation; and (iv)\nsocial,  resettlement,  and  environmental  impacts  are  monitored.\nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants.  Detailed  design  engineering  and\nconstruction  supervision  will  be  carried  out  by  qualified  local\ndesign institutes recruited by TMDPC; these services will not be\nfinanced by ADB.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date   31 December 2005\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries The Project will directly benefit 9.6 million urban residents in the\nTianjin  urban  area  whose  living  conditions  and  public  health\nstandards will be improved through the removal of about 100,000", "v\ncubic meters per day of untreated sewage from the area, and\nprotection of the city's sole raw water supply from the serious\nthreat of increasing pollution. These environmental improvements\nwill  stimulate  economic  activity,  support  sustainable  economic\ngrowth, enhance the image of Tianjin as an international city, and\ncontribute  to  a  comprehensive  model  program  for  river  basin\nmanagement  and  cross-jurisdictional  pollution  prevention  and\ncontrol.  The  Project  will  bring  about  40,000  hectares  of  flood-\nprone  agricultural  land  into  full  productive  use,  and  reduce\npollution added to Bohai Bay, a critical marine resource.\nThe Project has been designed to mitigate all construction-related\nenvironmental impacts and adequate provision has been made to\nfully compensate the estimated 10,700 people adversely affected\nby the Project, primarily due to temporary and permanent loss of\nland. Physical relocation of 12 households (56 affected people) is\nexpected.  Extensive  consultation  with  affected  people  is  being\nundertaken  as  outlined  in  a  comprehensive  resettlement  plan,\nwhich will be made publicly available prior to any ground leveling\nor  construction.  A  summary  resettlement  plan,  made  publicly\navailable in the PRC prior to loan negotiations, is available on the\nADB website.\nThe  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  preventing\nincreases  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  to  reduce\nspending on medical care and sick days taken, thus providing\nmore  income  to  households;  (ii)  safeguarding  the  quality  of\ndrinking  water  and  improving  wastewater  services,  as  poverty\ngoes beyond income levels and includes deprivation of essential\nassets and opportunities to which every human is entitled such as\nclean  water  and  a  clean  environment;  and  (iii)  providing\nemployment  opportunities  to  women  through  the  All  China\nWomen\u2019s Federation.\nIn  addition  to  the  direct  benefits,  the  Project  will  help  support\neconomic growth. The policy dialogue for tariff reforms and cost\nrecovery undertaken during project processing will help eliminate\nexisting subsidies. Wastewater and water tariffs will be increased\nto ensure full cost recovery is achieved by 2005, the first year of\noperation  of  the  new  systems.  As  a  result  of  ongoing  policy\ndialogue,  TMG  increased  wastewater  and  water  tariffs  by  62\npercent in November 1999. An affordability analysis estimates tariffs\nunder the Project to be an acceptable 4.5 percent of income for the\npoorest 5 percent of households and 1.5 percent for mean income\nhouseholds by the year 2005.", "vi", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water\nResources Protection Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2.  The Project is in Tianjin, the PRC\u2019s fourth largest city. Tianjin has a population of 9.6\nmillion,  is  a  municipality  with  the  status  of  a  province,  similar  to  Beijing,  Chongqing,  and\nShanghai, and is a major industrial center. Tianjin lies between Beijing and the coast of Bohai\nBay, at the mouth of rivers forming the heavily polluted Hai River Basin. Seven of the nine major\nrivers in the basin flow through Tianjin to Bohai Bay. The Project is one of a number of planned\nwastewater  treatment  and  water  resources  protection  projects  under  the  Hai  River  Basin\nPollution Prevention and Control Plan (HRPPCP), funded by the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB). This basinwide program comprises more than 600 potential projects, of which the high-\npriority projects will be implemented under the PRC Transcentury Green Plan. Tianjin is a\npriority  area  under  the  plan,  and  the  components  of  the  Project  have  been  selected  for\nimmediate implementation under the HRPPCP.\n3.  In 1999, ADB approved a technical assistance (TA) to help TMG formulate the Project.1\nThe TA study reviewed the feasibility studies prepared by local design institutes and confirmed\nthe need to improve wastewater collection and treatment and to protect Tianjin's sole raw water\nsupply source from the increasing threat of pollution. The final TA report was presented in\nFebruary 2000. The results of TA reports, Government feasibility studies, the findings of ADB\nmissions,2 and extensive discussions with Government officials and project beneficiaries during\nvisits to Tianjin from the basis of this report. The linkages between the goals, objectives,\noutputs, and inputs for the proposed Project are in the project logical framework (Appendix 1).\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n4.  Concurrent with the relatively high economic growth in the past 20 years, the PRC's\nurban population in 668 cities has been growing rapidly, increasing from about 190 million in\n1980 to 376 million, or 31 percent of the total population in 1999. These estimates exclude the\n\u201cfloating\u201d population,3 which has grown rapidly during the past 10 years, particularly in larger\ncities. Rapid rural to urban migration is expected to continue in the foreseeable future and about\n700 million people, equivalent to 45 percent of the population, are expected to live in cities by\n2010. Growth of the urban economy and populations has placed pressure on an overloaded\nurban infrastructure while increasing the threat of water pollution.\n                                                \n1\nTA 3216-PRC: Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water Resources Protection, for $800,000, approved on 2 July\n1999.\n2\n The appraisal mission was fielded from 15-25 May 2000, and comprised M. Westfall, Urban Development\nSpecialist-Mission Leader; Y.L. Feng, Environment Specialist; S. Price, Sr. Social Development Specialist; O.\nTiwana, Counsel; M. Varkay, Programs Officer; T. Chien, Environmental Engineer-Staff Consultant; M. Diab, Social\nSpecialist-Staff Consultant; F. Waters, Economic-Financial Analyst-Staff Consultant; W. Yan, Tariff Specialist-Staff\nConsultant.\n3\n The floating population includes transient workers and informal commercial traders who live in the urban center full-\nor part-time, but who do not have residency permits, and the unskilled workers and farmers who enter the urban\narea for day labor and the markets. The floating population is estimated to be between 70 million and 100 million\npeople.", "2\n5.  The growing need for basic urban services resulting from ongoing rapid urban growth is\nincreasingly constraining the physical and financial capacity of most cities to provide adequate\nwater infrastructure for the delivery of clean, safe water supply. This has led to a deterioration of\nthe quality of life for urban residents, degradation of the urban environment, and inefficient\neconomic development. The situation has been exacerbated by the pollution of raw water\nsources(cid:190) lakes,  rivers,  reservoirs,  local  streams,  canals,  and  groundwater  sources(cid:190) by\nuntreated or partially treated municipal and industrial wastewater. Because of the seriousness of\nthe situation, the Government is paying increasing attention to water resources management\nand pollution control. Large-scale investments in water supply and water resources protection\nwill be needed in the foreseeable future to improve the living conditions of urban residents and\nto sustain economic growth.\n6.  During the era of the centrally planned economy, the provision of water was considered\na basic social need and was heavily subsidized by the Government. Water tariffs in many cities\nremained unchanged for 20-40 years. As a result, water supply companies (WSCs) did not have\nsufficient financial resources to expand or to operate and maintain existing systems. Also,\nconsumers had no market-oriented incentives to conserve water. Beginning in the mid-1980s,\nthe need for tariff adjustments was recognized because of inflation and demand growth fueled\nby rapid economic growth. Under the Government's ongoing market-based reforms, all WSCs\nand new water supply projects, including those dealing with raw water supply delivery, are\nrequired to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. Between 1986 and 1996,\nthere were major increases in water tariffs, averaging 17-20 percent annually. This reflects the\nGovernment's commitment to bring commercial principles to the water sector. Despite these\nincreases, water tariffs are still low, and need to be increased in many cities.\n7.  The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  is  responsible  for  the  planning  and\nadministration of water resources. It manages the water intake permit system; coordinates water\nresource use among the different sectors; formulates interregional and interprovincial water\nallocation and distribution alternatives; and prepares long-term water demand projections and\nsupply plans at the central, provincial, and municipal levels. The Ministry of Construction (MOC),\nthrough the provincial and municipal construction commissions, is responsible for overseeing\nurban plans for major cities, including plans and investments for urban wastewater treatment\n(WWT) and water resources protection.\n8.  The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), through its policies and programs,\nplays an important role in the development of sound environmental practices in the PRC water\nsector.  The  SEPA\u2019s  major  responsibilities  include  (i)  developing  national  environmental\nprotection  policies,  strategies,  laws,  and  administrative  regulations;  (ii)  coordinating  and\nproviding  guidance  on  major  environmental  issues;  (iii)  developing  national  environmental\nstandards;  and  (iv)  administering  the  national  environmental  certification  system  and  the\nmonitoring and information network.\n9.  Private sector participation in the PRC\u2019s water sector is still at a very early stage of\ndevelopment. The major source of financing continues to be Government equity and grants\nsupplemented by domestic loans and official development assistance. Between 1991 and 1997,\nthe local governments spent Y50 billion ($6.0 billion) on water supply. The investment required\nfor urban water supply is estimated to be Y74 billion ($8.9 billion) between 1997 and 2000, a 48\npercent increase over expenditures in the 1991 to 1997 period. The Government recognizes\nthat greater efforts are required to mobilize private sector funding. In 1991, the Government", "3\nadopted a policy to allow foreign investment in the sector. For infrastructure projects, the\nGovernment is experimenting with the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.4\n10.  Water pollution remains a serious problem in most PRC cities. In the early 1990s only a\nsmall amount of wastewater generated by cities was treated and an even lower percentage met\nnational discharge standards. This problem is being progressively tackled by the Government\nwithin both the eighth and ninth five-year plans. Initial efforts have focused on industrial WWT;\nby the end of 1997 an estimated 62 percent of industrial discharges met the relevant standard,\nup from 20 percent reported earlier in the decade. All industrial discharges must comply with the\nstandard by the end of 2000. Investment is also being made in municipal WWT but progress is\nslower, with only approximately 20 percent of wastewater from an urban population in excess of\n400 million receiving adequate treatment. Municipal wastewater is therefore a major cause of\npollution in streams, rivers, lakes, and some coastal waters.\n11.  To improve the quality of life of urban populations and to achieve sustainable growth and\ndevelopment, better environmental quality is necessary. Large investments are required to\naddress these problems along with improved legal, regulatory, and enforcement frameworks,\nand the provision of market-based incentives designed to encourage environmental-friendly\nproduction practices. The Government has recognized that pollution of water resources is a\nmajor  threat  to  sustainable  development  and  health  of  the  PRC\u2019s  large  urban  population.\nEnvironmental issues were accorded high priority during the National People\u2019s Congress held in\nBeijing in March 1998. The congress recognized that the degradation of the PRC\u2019s water\nsystems, in particular lakes and rivers, requires urgent attention. The Ninth Five-Year Plan\n(1996-2000) aims to invest Y12 billion ($1.4 billion) in the 52 most polluted cities, mostly in the\neastern provinces, for the construction of wastewater treatment plants and collection systems.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n12.  The  Government  has  identified  urban  wastewater  and  water  resources  as  priority\nsectors of the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing water\nsources; (ii) protecting existing sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution in\nrivers, lakes, and reservoirs; (iii) controlling overextraction from groundwater resources; and (iv)\nimproving demand management by introducing water-saving technologies and operations and\nusing  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms.  Guidelines  emphasize  (i)  proper  planning  and  the\ninclusion  of  wastewater  and  water  supply  projects  in  economic  development  plans;  (ii)\nmobilizing  financial  resources  from  users  and  from  various  Government  sources  for  the\nconstruction of new facilities; (iii) full cost recovery from industrial and commercial users and\nrecovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs from residential users by the year 2000;\n(iv) use of loans and credit to finance projects; and (v) application of new technology where\nappropriate.\n13.  The Government has formulated a number of programs to address water shortages and\nwater quality. Many of the programs are supported by ADB and other bilateral and multilateral\nagencies. Generally, the investments are funded locally or supported by concessional aid,\nrather than loans on commercial terms. The Government is increasingly concerned about the\nneed for policy reform and capacity building to improve water resource management, and to\nintroduce cost-recovery techniques and enable water delivery programs to be financially self-\nsustaining.\n                                                \n4\nA construction agreement on the first urban water infrastructure project for Chengdu City, approved by the\nGovernment to investigate the use of foreign funds under the BOT methodology, was signed in July 1998, and was\nthe result of ADB assistance in structuring and partially financing the project. Official construction started in early\n1999 with completion expected in September 2001.", "4\n14.  Environmental  policies  were  initially  developed  in  the  1980s,  when  a  system  of\nenvironmental management  was  put  in  place,5  including  standards  for  airborne  emissions,\nwastewater effluents, and solid waste disposal.6 Policies addressing environmental problems\nwere  contained  in  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan,  which  emphasized  strict  compliance  with\nenvironmental  protection  laws  and  regulations.  Major  achievements  included  (i)  requiring\nenvironmental impact assessments (EIA) for new investment projects;7 (ii) using fees, fines, and\ncompensation  payments  to  implement  the  polluter-pays  principle;  (iii)  using  the  target\nresponsibility system, which involves the establishment of contracts with local governments and\nagencies setting out environmental targets and goals; and (iv) strengthening environmental\nmanagement  at  the  national  and  local  levels.  In  the  1990s,  SEPA  developed  a  more\ncomprehensive strategy to address industrial pollution prevention and control. Solutions have\nbeen shifted from end-of-pipe treatment toward an emphasis on cleaner production processes,\nan initiative ADB is supporting.\n15.  Because of the severity of urban environmental problems, the Government has made\ncities the focal point of its environmental protection efforts. The Government's program for\ncomprehensive improvement of the urban environment emphasizes (i) reducing air pollution\nthrough improved coal-burning methods, more extensive use of natural gas and coal, and the\nintroduction of clean coal technology; (ii) upgrading basic infrastructure including water supply,\ndrainage, and the protection of water resources; (iii) reducing vehicular pollution; and (iv) urban\nreforestation. ADB has helped the Government improve environmental conditions in selected\nmedium-sized cities by preparing environmental improvement programs and supporting action\nplans,8 which are being used to guide development in an environmentally responsible manner.\n16.  In 1996, the State Council issued guidelines requiring all major cities to give priority to\nenvironmental protection and management. SEPA has identified 47 priority cities, including\nTianjin, for improved environmental protection, and included the environmental improvement\nprograms for these cities in the Ninth Five-Year Plan. ADB has supported these efforts by\nhelping to upgrade the knowledge and skills of senior local government officials in the priority\ncities to plan and implement environmental infrastructure, and to develop and enforce local\nenvironmental policies, rules, and regulations.9\n17.  Environmental protection is now clearly established as a national priority in the PRC\u2019s\ndevelopment  strategy,  with  all  medium-  and  long-term  investment  plans  incorporating\nenvironmental  sustainability  as  a  fundamental  component.  The  Government\u2019s  continuing\nemphasis on price and enterprise reforms, aimed at improving industrial efficiency and providing\ngreater autonomy and accountability at the enterprise level complements the environmental\npolicies  and  regulations.  Price  liberalization  will  promote  environment-friendly  behavior  by\nencouraging energy efficiency and resource conservation. The Government is increasing the\n                                                \n5\n ADB supported this process by providing TA 987-PRC: Institutional Strengthening of the National Environmental\nProtection Agency, for $340,000, approved on 10 June 1988.\n6\nThis includes the Law on Solid Waste Pollution Prevention and Treatment, covering hazardous and toxic wastes,\nwhich was formulated in 1996. Progress on classification of hazardous and toxic wastes is ongoing with assistance\nfrom the World Bank.\n7\nADB has made major contributions under TA 987-PRC (footnote 5); TA 1436-PRC: Environmental Impact\nAssessment and Training, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1990; TA 1988-PRC: Environmental Impact\nAssessment and Training, for $900,000, approved on 18 November 1993; and TA 2975-PRC: Environmental\nImpact Assessment and Training, for $600,000, approved on 31 December 1997.\n8\nTA 2456-PRC: Pilot Environmental Plans for Selected Medium-size Cities, for $537,000, approved on 4 December\n1995.\n9\nTA 2906-PRC: Leadership Training on Urban Environmental Management in Key Cities, for $600,000, approved on\n3 November 1997.", "5\npollution levy, while improving the administration of the pollution levy fund, to make more\ninvestment funds available for waste minimization technology and industrial WWT facilities.\nDuring the 1990s, the prices of most key commodities have been liberalized to reflect market\nconditions, which provides better market-based incentives to conserve industrial inputs.\n18.  Under the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the PRC has developed an umbrella environmental\nprogram with a target year of 2010. This program, the Transcentury Green Plan, designates\nthree river basins (Hai, Huai, and Liao) and three lakes (Chao, Dianchi, and Tai) for intense\nplanning and project implementation to alleviate serious environmental problems affecting water\nquality and the contiguous population.\n19.  In response to the required action for the Hai River Basin, the PRC developed the\nHRPPCP, which was approved by the State Council in March 1999. The HRPPCP designates\nTianjin as one of four major cities, along with Beijing, Shijiazhang, and Qinhuangdao, requiring\nurgent intervention in pollution control. The plan requires that all main river sections in Tianjin\nmeet their designated standard, and drinking water sources meet class III national standards for\ndrinking water sources.10 The PRC has recently designated Bohai Bay as a major water body\nrequiring national level intervention for cleanup.11\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n20.  Addressing urban environmental problems and improving WWT and water resources\nprotection  is  accorded  high  priority  in  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  operational  strategy.  ADB  has\nprovided nine loans, totaling more than $1 billion, for environmental improvement, wastewater\nmanagement, and water supply. ADB has provided three loans for water resource management\nand supply in Dalian City,12 Zhejiang Province,13 and Fuzhou City14 in Fujian Province. ADB has\nalso provided a loan to help reduce pollution and restore the water quality in Suzhou Creek and\nits tributaries in Shanghai City.15 Several of ADB\u2019s urban environment projects have financed\nWWT components (e.g., Beijing, Chengde, Hefei, Qingdao, and Tangshan).16 The municipal\nWWT component of the Anhui Environmental Improvement Project17 is proceeding on schedule.\nInitial  concern  about  cost  recovery  has  been  mitigated  through  policy  dialogue  on  tariff\nincreases and the introduction of commercial management principles. These measures have\nhelped to demonstrate that such projects can be financially viable under the lending terms of\n                                                \n10\nThe class III standard is one of five classes. Class I, the highest standard, is for water supply sources with limited\ntreatment and national natural reserves; II and III are for fishing and recreation, and may be used as water supply\nsources where full treatment is employed; IV is suitable for industrial uses and recreational uses not involving\ncontact between the water and people\u2019s bodies; and V is for agricultural uses and scenic viewing.\n11\nADB  has  supported  environmental  improvement  in  Bohai  Bay  through  TA  2695-PRC:  Coastal Resources\nConservation and Environmental Improvement, for $810,000, approved on 3 December 1996.\n12\nLoan 1313-PRC: Dalian Water Supply Project, for $160 million, approved on 20 September 1994.\n13\nLoan 1544-PRC: Zhejiang-Shanxi Water Supply Project (Phase I), for $100 million, approved on 24 September\n1997.\n14\nLoan 1636-PRC: Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, for $102 million, approved on 30\nSeptember 1998.\n15\n Loan 1692-PRC: Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project, for $300 million, approved on 29 June 1999.\n16\nLoan 1205-PRC: Qingdao Environmental Improvement Project, for $103 million, approved on 10 December 1992;\nLoan 1270-PRC: Tangshan and Chengde Environmental Improvement Project, for $140 million, approved on 2\nNovember 1993; Loan 1336-PRC: Beijing Environmental Improvement Project, for $157 million, approved on 29\nNovember 1993; and Loan 1543-PRC: Xian-Xianyang-Tongchuan Environmental Improvement Project, for $156\nmillion, approved on 24 September 1997.\n17\nLoans 1490 and 1491-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Municipal Wastewater Treatment and\nIndustrial Pollution Abatement, for $140 million, approved on 26 November 1996.", "6\nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. As a result, ADB\u2019s future PRC program includes an increasing\nnumber of projects in the wastewater and water resources sectors.\n21.  Since 1989, ADB has financed 52 TA studies for $27 million to address issues relating to\nwater resource management, environment, and water supply. ADB has helped to strengthen the\nPRC\u2019s policies and strategies for water resources, including a TA that assessed the strategic\noptions for the water sector.18 This study focused on the management of water resources from\nan entire river basin perspective, with emphasis on development of basic data, and identification\nof pollution and erosion control measures, as well as methods for allocation of scarce water\nresources. ADB has also supported specific water resource management and planning activities\nin the Beijing-Tianjin area, Dalian, Hainan Island, and the Hai River Basin; and water quality\nmanagement planning in Shanghai.19\n22.  ADB has supported the water supply tariff reform process through a recently completed\nstudy,  and  a  follow-on  study  currently  underway,  with  the  Ministry  of  Construction.20  The\ncompleted study found that the average cost of urban water production has increased more\nthan  six-fold  during  the  past  decade  due  to  increasingly  poor  raw  water  quality,  higher\nproduction standards, and increases in the price of inputs. The study assisted the Government\nin developing the National Guidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT), focusing on improving the cost\nrecovery performance of the WSCs and promoting water conservation. The follow-on study is\nassisting  the  Government  in  developing  the  institutional  and  methodological  capacities  to\nimplement the NGWT at the local level, and to promote public consultations through public\nhearings. Recent affordability studies indicate that the proposed higher water tariffs remain\naffordable, particularly as real average incomes in the PRC have risen by 19 percent annually\nduring the 1990s. While affordability is generally not a problem in major cities and for the more\nprosperous east coast residents, it remains a concern in some of the poorer interior regions.\n23.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  PRC\u2019s  wastewater,  water  supply,  and  water  resources\nmanagement sectors has resulted in more rational pricing of water, major increases in water\ntariffs, introduction of wastewater tariffs, implementation of commercial principles, improved\nenvironmental  management  and  related  fees,  formulation  of  effluent  standards  and\ndevelopment of regulatory aspects, and introduction of private sector participation. ADB is also\nassisting the Government to design and implement market-based instruments for water quality\nmanagement  and  establish  dynamic  water  quality  monitoring  capabilities.21  These  are\nfundamental improvements that will help make the water and wastewater sectors financially and\noperationally sustainable.\n24.  In addition to ADB, the World Bank and a number of bilateral agencies have supported\nthe  urban  wastewater  and  water  resources  sectors  in  the  PRC.  The  World  Bank  has\nparticipated in 19 urban, environmental, and water supply projects. The $700 million of World\nBank assistance has generally been from International Development Association resources, and\nhas been combined with urban development and environmental improvement programs.

The World Bank's\nwater resources projects have been concentrated in the Yellow River Basin.\n25.  Japan,  through  its  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  is  the  largest\nbilateral source of aid to the PRC and is mainly involved in physical infrastructure, water\nresources  development,  and  environmental  improvement  projects.  Since  1989,  JBIC  has\nprovided loans on concessional terms for 11 urban water supply projects totaling $900 million,\nand WWT projects on the Huao and Xiang rivers and in Mudanjiang. In March 1999, JBIC\napproved the concept for preparation of an urban sewerage treatment project in five cities in\nZhejiang Province.\n26.  Bilateral aid agencies, including from Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany,\nItaly, Norway, Sweden, and United Kingdom, are also involved in the wastewater and water\nresources sectors, although on a smaller scale. Most bilateral assistance has been designed to\naddress  urban  environmental  problems  with  an  emphasis  on  wastewater  and  sewerage\ntreatment, and energy conservation.\n27.  In Tianjin, the World Bank has been involved in the water supply and sewerage sector.\nIn 1992, the World Bank financed an urban development and environment project, which was\nefficiently implemented, and is planning a related second project in 2001. The second project\nincludes  (i)  urban  transportation,  (ii)  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  and  (iii)  river\nrehabilitation. A World Bank loan for sewerage and drainage improvements in the middle portion\nof the Beicang district in urban Tianjin is also under consideration. Facilities include storm\ndrains, sewers, and pump stations. The total investment cost is estimated at Y650 million.\n28.  In Tianjin, JBIC financed a water supply expansion project in 1990 and is planning to\nfinance sewage treatment projects under a fourth batch of loans to the PRC (1999-2000). The\nJBIC Tianjin Wastewater Treatment Project has tentative JBIC financing of Y7.2 billion. Loan\nnegotiations  for  the  project  were  completed  in  October  2000.  The  components  include  (i)\nexpansion and rehabilitation of the Jizhuangzi WWT plant, (ii) construction of the new Xianyang\nRoad WWT plant, and (iii) drainage and sewage collection in the southeast suburbs.\n29.  These projects are fully complementary and supportive to the proposed Project. There\nwas close coordination between ADB, JBIC, and World Bank during project processing to\nensure that their assistance in the water sector in Tianjin is complementary and that duplication\nand overlap are avoided.\nD. Lessons Learned\n30.  Projects  in  ADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio  have  generally  been  implemented  on  or  ahead  of\nschedule, and have performed well. This reflects a rigorous internal screening process, strong\nproject ownership, and good technical capabilities of executing agencies. For some projects,\ndelays  have  occurred  in  loan  signing  and  effectiveness  as  well  as  in  procurement.  The\nGovernment is streamlining the multiple approval process to address these problems, which\ntend to occur with weaker executing agencies.\n31.  Experience  in  wastewater  and  water  resources  management  in  the  PRC,  although\nlimited, indicates that projects are well implemented and that water and wastewater tariffs are\nincreased as required. Willingness-to-pay analysis has indicated that consumers are willing to\npay substantially higher prices for water, and to a certain extent, are willing to pay for WWT.\nIssues related to tariff levels, cost recovery, and commercial orientation of the water utilities\nneed to be carefully addressed during project processing. Under the WWT component of the\nAnhui Environmental Improvement Project, tariffs were increased to levels commensurate with", "8\nfull  cost  recovery  of  O&M  costs.  Capital  costs  are  also  being  partially  recovered  through\nconnection  fees.  Under  the  Fuzhou  Water  Supply  and  Wastewater  Treatment  Project,\ncovenants require wastewater tariffs to be increased to cover all O&M and financial costs\nassociated with treating wastewater by 2003.\n32.  Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s postevaluation experience in wastewater, water supply,\nand water resources management in the Asian and Pacific Region indicate that both supply-\nand demand-side concerns must be integrated into project designs. Encouraging broad reforms\nsuch  as  commercial  management  and  introducing  competition  will  promote  efficient  and\nresponsive delivery of water supply and wastewater services. Appropriate pricing policies for\nwater  and  sanitation  services  are  also  required.  The  policy  agenda  for  water  supply  and\nwastewater projects in the PRC has centered around cost recovery, tariff reform, and water\nresource and wastewater management.\n33.  During project processing, lessons of experience have been addressed by (i) thoroughly\nevaluating the technical designs and technologies; (ii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for\nTianjin Sewerage Company (TSC) and the Tianjin Municipal Luanhe Drinking Water Source\nProtection Engineering Ltd (TML); (iii) undertaking rigorous sensitivity analysis of cash flows,\nand financial and economic analysis; (iv) incorporating institutional strengthening measures to\nimprove the level of corporate governance; and (v) securing autonomy in operations and for\nprocurement decisions by TSC and TML.\nE. ADB's Country and Sectoral Strategy\n34.  ADB\u2019s three strategic objectives for the PRC are to (i) improve economic efficiency, (ii)\npromote growth to reduce poverty in poor interior provinces, and (iii) enhance environmental\nprotection and natural resource management. Improving water supply and sanitation facilities is\nimportant  to  enhance  the  living  standards  and  productivity  of  urban  populations,  arrest\nenvironmental degradation, and sustain levels of economic growth. Developing efficient water\nsupply systems, including the treatment and distribution of raw water and the treatment and\ndisposal of wastewater, will require substantial investments in both physical infrastructure and\nhuman resource development. ADB is pursuing priority projects for urban wastewater, sewage\ntreatment, water supply, and water resources management. Because of the need to achieve\ncost  recovery,  the  country  operational  strategy  provides  for  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  highly\nurbanized areas in the eastern coastal areas where urban environmental problems are acute\nand income levels are high enough to make the related tariffs affordable. Project preparatory TA\nis used to prepare, formulate, and process urban infrastructure projects in cities with the most\nurgent requirements. Policy-support TA is provided to strengthen the management and financial\ncapabilities of the agencies involved in the lending program, to develop reforms for improving\ncost recovery and financial management of water supply and wastewater, and to help prioritize\ninvestments in water supply.\n35.  In the water sector, ADB is focusing on (i) improving the efficiency of water supply and\ndistribution  systems  through  investment  in  physical  infrastructure,  (ii)  promoting  improved\ncorporate governance and commercial management to enhance the potential for future private\nsector involvement, (iii) improving cost recovery by strengthening tariff systems and structures\nfor raw and treated water, and (iv) ensuring water resources conservation and environmental\nprotection through the continuing support of legislative and regulatory provisions.\n36.  One of ADB's strategic objectives in its PRC operations is to help improve environmental\nand natural resource management. During the 1998 ADB Country Programming Mission, the\nPRC  requested  advisory  TA  to  prepare  a  strategic  plan  for  wastewater  management  and", "9\npollution control for the Hai River Basin.22 The TA was completed in January 2000. In 1999,\nduring the midterm review of the ADB country assistance plan, the PRC reconfirmed an earlier\nrequest for TA for a Tianjin WWT and water resources protection project. Subsequently, ADB\napproved a project preparatory TA. The proposed Project is one of the first initiatives being\nsupported  by  ADB  within  the  context  of  the  Hai  River  Basin  program  of  environmental\nimprovement, and is consistent with the ADB strategy.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n37.  ADB's agenda for policy dialogue in the wastewater and water resources sectors is\nbeing  pursued  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform;  (ii)  watershed\nmanagement; (iii) upstream pollution prevention and control; (iv) market-based instruments for\nwastewater management, including tradable permits and the pollution levy system; (v) clean\nproduction technologies; (vi) regulatory enforcement and monitoring; (vii) water conservation;\n(viii) corporate governance and enterprise reform; (ix) wastewater management; and (x) private\nsector participation.\n1. Cost Recovery and Tariff Reform\n38.  The Project will support the Government\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform\nprograms that require that all wastewater and water supply projects be financially sustainable\nand capable of cost recovery. The Government's policy guidance on setting of wastewater tariffs\nhas recently been amended by Circular No. 1192, issued jointly in September 1999 by State\nDevelopment  Planning  Commission  (SDPC),  MOC,  and  SEPA.  The  circular  provides  that\nwastewater tariffs be set on the basis of full cost recovery principles and requests urgent action\nby the end of 1999 to implement the circular in priority areas of \"the three lakes and three\nrivers.\" Tianjin is in one of those priority areas, being part of the Hai River Basin.\n39.  ADB\u2019s Water Tariff Study23 supported the Government\u2019s initiatives by assisting with the\ndevelopment of national guidelines for appropriate water tariff mechanisms at the national level,\nincluding the NGWT. The NGWT were promulgated by the SDPC and MOC in September 1999,\nand will become fully operational over the next two years. In accordance with these regulations,\nand as a result of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, Tianjin City has increased its water and wastewater\ntariffs effective 1 November 1999 by 62 percent. The average retail water tariff in the city is now\nY1.40/cubic  meter  (m3)  compared  with  the  Y1.1/m3  average  in  1998,  and  the  average\nwastewater tariff is now Y0.35/m3 compared with the Y0.27/m3 average in 1998. The retail water\ntariffs include a raw water fee. The WWT fee is included on water supply bills as a separate and\nadditional item, or is billed separately by TSC where municipal water supply is not provided. The\nproceeds from these fees are administered by Tianjin Water Supply Company and TSC, and\nused solely for providing water and wastewater services and infrastructure.\n40.  Based on a financial assessment of the WWT component, the domestic wastewater tariff\nrates required by TSC will need to increase from the current rate of Y0.2/m3 to Y0.6/m3 in by\n2003 and to Y1.20/m3 by 2005, and remain constant in real terms thereafter. Industrial and other\ntariff user rates will need to increase from the current rate of Y0.4/m3 to Y0.8/m3 in 2003 and to\nY1.2/m3 in 2005 and stay constant in real terms thereafter. These prices will ensure full cost\nrecovery for TSC including its operating and investment costs and provide a reasonable profit.\n41.  Tianjn  Municipal  Government  (TMG)  plans  to  continue  to  subsidize  stormwater\noperations at Y34 million per annum, remaining constant in real terms. This subsidy recognizes\n                                                \n22\nTA 3095-PRC: Hai River Basin Wastewater Management and Pollution Control Project, for $570,000, approved on\n10 November 1998.\n23\nTA3250-PRC: Water Tariff Study II, for $950,000, approved on 3 September 1999.", "10\nthe natural public good this service provides, and is consistent with ADB policy. TMG will cease\nthe sewerage subsidy, currently at Y5.6 million. TMG will reduce the sewage treatment subsidy,\ncurrently at Y75 million, by 50 percent, and by 2003 eliminate the subsidy altogether. The\nphasing out of these subsidies is consistent with both Government and ADB policy.\n42.  Based on a financial assessment of the WRP component, the required wholesale prices\nfor raw water to be sold by TML to the Tianjin WSCs need to increase from the current rate of\nY0.40/m3  to  Y0.65/m3  in  2003  and  Y0.85/m3  in  2005,  and  remain  constant  in  real  terms\nthereafter. Raw water tariffs to industries that recycle water will need to increase from the\ncurrent rate of Y0.13/m3 to Y0.22/m3 in 2003 and Y0.28/m3 in 2005, and remain constant in real\nterms thereafter. These prices will ensure full cost recovery for TML including its operating and\ninvestment costs and provide a reasonable profit. In addition, TMG will fund the estimated Y47m\ncash shortfall in 2001.\n43.  An affordability analysis for 2005 estimates that the combined retail water bill for raw\nwater, wastewater, and an incremental tap water charge will be affordable. For the mean\nincome household, the monthly combined bill is Y32, around 1.5 percent of income. For the\npoorest 5 percent of households, the monthly combined water bill is Y35, around 4.5 percent of\nincome. The affordability analysis is given as Appendix 2.\n2. Comprehensive Watershed Management\n44.  Water quality in the Luan River to the Tianjin diversion channel has deteriorated in\nrecent  years  and  needs  to  be  restored  to  ensure  that  drinking  water  quality  in  Tianjin\nconsistently  meets  national  standards.  The  flood  control,  river  flow  augmentation,  and\nagricultural irrigation roles of the diversion compete with the drinking water supply needs.\nDiscussions  have  been  undertaken  with  the  Tianjin  Water  Conservancy  Bureau,  and  the\nbureau\u2019s unit that is to become the new TML, on watershed management practices based on\nthe  best-known  international  practices.  TML  expressed  strong  interest  in  strengthening\ncomprehensive watershed management. Training in watershed management is included in the\nimplementation package of the proposed loan.\n3. Upstream Pollution Prevention and Control\n45.  The policy dialogue on environmental policy and upstream pollution issues is directly\nrelated to watershed management. During project processing, discussions were focused on the\neffect of total pollution loads, particularly total phosphorus from upstream sources not under the\ncontrol of Tianjin. Following completion of the ADB-funded HRPPCP, TMG completed a study in\nAugust 1999 entitled the \"Integrated Pollution Control Program for Yuqiao Reservoir.\" The\nreport addresses existing pollution loading and estimates the likely results of corrective and\npreventive actions. Specifically, the report points out that 53.5 percent of total phosphorus, the\ncritical nutrient in reservoir eutrophication, comes from the upstream flows from the Zunhua City\narea of Hebei Province and two major fertilizer plants.\n46.  Implementation of the relevant HRPPCP pollution abatement measures, as reinforced in\nthe final report of ADB-funded TA 3095 (footnote 22), the Hai River Basin study, are seen as a\nhigh  priority  by  the  Government.  TMG  interagency  cooperation  and  cross-jurisdictional\nprograms are vital elements, and several mechanisms are in place. TMG and Hebei provincial\ngovernment have held a number of meetings to address cooperation, and the dialogue is\nexpected to be advanced by the Hai River Basin Commission. TMG and Zunhua City are\nexploring the idea of setting up a jointly-financed environmental fund for industrial WWT in\nZunhua City. The 2000 country assistance plan includes assistance from ADB to address trans-", "11\njurisdictional pollution at a policy level.24 In support of the comprehensive Hai River Basin\nprogram, the country assistance plan includes a $100 million Hebei Hai and Luan wastewater\nproject in its 2002 pipeline. Together with the proposed Project, these interventions can ensure\nan integrated, coordinated response to pollution prevention and control. In addition, further\nstudies  recommended  under  Hai  River  Basin  study  would  strengthen  regulatory  and  legal\nframeworks guiding environmental standards development, penalty and incentive mechanisms,\ncross-border dispute settlement, and harmonize institutional inspection mechanisms.\n4. Wastewater Management\n47.  ADB has supported the Government\u2019s policies for wastewater management by providing\na number of related environmental loans that included WWT components in Beijing, Chaohu,\nChengde, Fuzhou, Hefei, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Tangshan. The importance of WWT was also\naddressed  under  the  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Planning  TA25  that  strengthened\ninstitutions responsible for environmental improvement in a number of cities, and identified\nfuture infrastructure requirements.\n48.  The urban area of Tianjin is very densely developed, with a typical density of 600 people\nper hectare in residential areas. Urban housing has been carefully controlled and planned,\nincluding the provision of septic tanks in large apartment buildings and separation of sewage\nfrom storm water. Total wastewater flows are 1.4 million m3/day, with industrial wastewater\naccounting for more than half of the total. The existing wastewater collection and transfer\nsystem in the project area is inadequate. There are no WWT plants in the Beicang area. The\nexisting Jizhuangzi WWT plant is overloaded and slated for extension, and a new plant is to be\nbuilt at Xian Yang Road by the end of 2003. Only 47 percent of wastewater flows are treated,\nand downstream sections of the rivers, waterways, and canals are heavily polluted mainly due\nto untreated wastewater discharge. Accordingly, wastewater management was a key aspect of\npolicy dialogue during project processing.\n49.  TMG has prepared wastewater master plans, including sewers, interceptors, and WWT\nplants. The six urban sewerage districts of Tianjin already contain sewers serving a substantial\nportion of existing development. The primary focus of the current wastewater programs is on\nproviding adequate treatment capacity and the trunk mains necessary to convey flows to the\nplants from the present points of discharge. The current plans for wastewater collection and\ntreatment facilities provide for extensive coverage by 2010.\n50.  To promote the reuse of treated sewage, TMG has approved two pilot programs to reuse\ntreated wastewater from WWT plants in Dagang and Ziezhuangzi. Wastewater will be treated to\nmeet standards for household uses, such as sanitation and gardening. A separate pipeline\nsystem will be constructed for each system. A preliminary estimate shows that the retail water\ntariff in the two towns will be lower than in other areas, which could provide an incentive for\nwider acceptance at the wastewater reuse concept.\n5. Market-Based instruments\n51.  Government policies have shifted out of command and control approaches and the\nintroduction of market-based instruments (MBIs). ADB is taking a lead role in helping to design\na water pollution trading system by actively supporting pilot projects in Fuzhou and Shanghai.\n                                                \n24\nPRC: TA Cluster for Trans-Jurisdiction Environmental Management, for $2.2 million, comprising of TAs for (i)\nlegislation and institutions, (ii) planning tools and methodologies, (iii) transcentury green program, and (iv) Yellow\nRiver pollution control. The cluster will be phased in a period of three years (2001-2003).\n25 TA 2015-PRC: Urban Environmental Improvement Planning, for $480,000, approved on 14 December 1993.", "12\nUse of MBIs can improve economic efficiency of wastewater management, and lower the costs\nof pollution reduction. During project processing, TMG\u2019s plans and programs to address the\npollution in the existing canals and inland waterways (the Hai River system) were assessed, and\nthe potential for use of MBI technologies for better environmental management was reviewed. A\nprerequisite for the use of MBIs is administrative control over an entire river basin and its total\npollution load, which is not the case for the Hai River in TMG.\n52.  During project processing, considerable scope was found for the development of a\npollution levy system as a charge related to marginal abatement and damage costs. Such a\ndevelopment could achieve least-cost benefits equal to or higher than the use of tradable\npermits, in this project-specific instance and without the need for large-scale legal or institutional\nchanges and probable high transaction costs associated with tradeable permits. TMG and the\nTianjin  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  (TEPB)  are  focusing  on  creating  an  enabling\nenvironment for MBIs by establishing total maximum allowable pollution loads to reach the\ndesired ambient water quality and strengthening monitoring and enforcement. During project\nimplementation, knowledge gained about MBIs in other ADB TAs will be shared with Tianjin.26\n53.  In the project area, MBIs are increasingly being used for industrial water conservation.\nThe  Tianjin  Water  Savings  Office  coordinates  water  conservation  efforts.  The  water\nconsumption  plan  identifies  the  optimal  consumption  of  industries.  Industrial  water  use  is\nregularly  surveyed  to  determine  whether  firms  exceed  this  optimal  use.  The  office  has  a\npublicity campaign targeted to domestic water users to promote conservation. As a result of\npolicy  dialogue  during  project  processing,  water  tariffs  were  revised  to  promote  water\nconservation  and  effective  demand-side  management.  Setting  water  tariffs  at  rates  that\nencourage water conservation is an effective market-based environmental management tool\nthat can cover domestic and industrial discharges at low administrative cost.\n6. Clean Production Technologies\n54.  Policies for the introduction of clean technology are closely related to the broader reform\nof  industry  and  the  program  of  industrial  restructuring  and  modernization  currently  being\nimplemented by the Government. ADB is supporting the promotion of clean technology through\na TA cluster of six subprojects.27 TMG is giving high priority to cleaning up the polluted inland\nwaterways  by  providing  assistance  to  increase  the  efficiencies  of  industrial  WWT  through\nimplementing process audits, adopting recommendations on clean technology, providing advice\non  pretreatment  systems,  and  making  funds  available  from  the  pollution  levy  fund.  TMG,\nthrough  TEPB,  has  made  substantial  progress  in  implementing  measures  to  ensure  full\ncompliance  with  industrial  discharge  standards.  Ambitious  targets  that  exceed  government\nguidelines that are being met by TMG. Industrial pollution control projects under way in TMG\nuse  clean  technology  as  well  as  traditional  \"end-of-pipe\"  solutions.  In  addition,  a  specific\nindustrial pollution control revolving fund has been established under the World Bank-supported\nTianjin Environmental Project (Phase I).\n                                                \n26\n TA 2951-PRC: Promotion of Market-Based Instruments in Environmental Management, for $697,0000, approved\non 16 December 1997; TA 3013-THA: Promotion of Market-Based Instruments in Environmental Management, for\n$605,000, approved on 5 May 1998; and TA 3211-PRC (footnote 21).\n27\n TA 3079-PRC: Promotion of Clean Technology, for $3,500,000, approved on 29 September 1998. The TA cluster\nconsists of (i) policies for promotion of clean technology; (ii) national network for clean technology transfer; (iii)\nlegislative support for clean technology; (iv) clean technology development; (v) environmental management for\nclean technologies in TVEs; and (vi) financing mechanisms for clean technologies in TVEs.", "13\n7. Regulatory Enforcement and Monitoring for Environmental Management\n55.  Attention to sound environmental management, including natural resources and water\nconservation, is a comparatively recent concern in the PRC. To help build the necessary\ncapacity  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework,  ADB  supported  the  training  of  staff  of  the\nEnvironment Protection Commission of the National People\u2019s Congress and the drafting and\nrevising  some  of  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  laws.28  ADB  is  also  helping  to  upgrade  the\nknowledge and skills of provincial legislative drafters in the review, amendment, and formulation\nof local legislation related to the protection and conservation of the environment and natural\nresources.29 ADB is supporting improved environmental management through (i) an analysis of\nthe most suitable market-based instruments; and (ii) the formulation of a program for their\nadoption, specifically in the water and energy sectors.30 In addition, ADB provided assistance in\nenvironmental management by improving the institutional capacity of SEPA, and the local and\nprovincial  environmental  protection  bureaus  to  strengthen  environmental  standards  and  to\nenforce environmental laws and policies.31 The PRC\u2019s environmental standards are not similar\nto international practice. The major issue is now compliance and enforcement.\n56.  In May 1996, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the 1984 Water Pollution Law to\naddress many of the weaknesses of the old law, and reflect the revisions to the Water Pollution\nPrevention and Control Law recommended under TA 2090-PRC (footnote 28). Also in 1996, the\nState Council approved the Ninth Five-Year Plan for Environmental Protection for 2010 with two\nsupplemental documents: the \u201cTotal Emission Quantity Control Plan for Major Pollutants.\u201d and\nthe \u201cTranscentury Green Plan.\u201d\n8. Water Conservation\n57.  The issue of water conservation has been an important part of the Government\u2019s and\nADB\u2019s  agenda  in  the  PRC  water  sector.  The  water  conservation  policies  that  have  been\npursued in conjunction with the Project include ensuring that system losses are minimized\nthrough efficient commercial operations, improved lining of water delivery channels, leakage\ndetection, and repair;32 and providing market-based incentives to reduce water use through\nadequate  pricing  of  water  and  wastewater  tariffs.  Water  conservation  policies  have  been\naddressed by the Project through the adoption of adequate pricing of water and promoting\ncommercial operations.\n58.  TMG  promulgated  the  Tianjin  City  Water  Conservation  Rules  in  1986,  which  were\namended in 1997. The Tianjin Water Savings Office implemented the rules, and is responsible\nfor policy, planning, training, and public awareness. The office develops a water savings plan\neach  year,  which  includes  indicators  to  evaluate  performance.  Nonresidential  water  use\nexceeding the assigned quota is surcharged up to 10 times the regular tariff. To avoid water\nlosses, the Tianjin Engineering and Construction Bureau has undertaken leakage detection.

The TA scope covers the PRC.", "14\nleakage detection workforce examines all water supply mains in the city, which has reduced the\noverall level of water losses from about 18 percent in 1998 to 13 percent in March 2000.\n9. Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform\n59.  Policy  dialogue  during  project  processing  addressed  four  aspects  of  corporate\ngovernance and enterprise reform: (i) structuring TSC and the TML along commercial lines, (ii)\npreparing a business plan, (iii) strengthening the operations of the boards of directors for the\ncompanies,  and  (iv)  implementing  external  and  internal  audit  arrangements.  The  Project's\ncomponent for WWT will be constructed, owned, and managed by TSC, a registered, limited\nliability  company.  This  is  in  accordance  with  State  Government  Circular  No.  1192,  which\nidentified the establishment of enterprise companies as the preferred institutional model for\nmanaging wastewater services. For the Project's water resources protection components, the\nfacilities will be constructed, owned, and managed by TML, a newly registered, limited liability\ncompany. Both companies will be responsible for their financial management and performance,\nand governed by a board of directors representing the shareholders. The board of directors will\nbe responsible for overseeing financial and operational matters including (i) hiring and firing\nsenior management, (ii) reviewing staffing and remuneration plans, (iii) reviewing the progress\nof construction and approving annual construction plans, (iv) reviewing and approving annual\nbudgets, and (v) approving procurement of major equipment and civil works contracts. Under\nthe loan, consulting assistance will be provided to develop the capacity of the companies in the\nareas of accounting, financial management, environmental and social monitoring capability, and\noperations and management.\n10. Private Sector Participation\n60.  ADB has played a leading role in introducing BOT in the PRC\u2019s water supply sector by\nsponsoring a conference33 and structuring transparent, competitive bidding for the Chengdu\nBOT project,34 the first such project in the PRC. During project processing, the main features of\nthe Chengdu BOT35 project were discussed with TMG, which expressed interest in this modality\nof  private  sector  involvement  for  future  investments.  Other  modalities  for  private  sector\nparticipation include leasing contracts and joint ventures.36 While private sector involvement for\nthe raw water supply and WWT components will not take place at this time, the Project will\ncreate the environment necessary for future participation by the private sector by pursuing a\nreform agenda on tariffs, the principle of full cost recovery, and corporatization (restructuring the\ngovernment  entities  as  corporations),  the  necessary  prerequisites  for  such  private  sector\ninvolvement.37  As  the  WWT  component  is  part  of  a  comprehensive  wastewater  system\ncomposed of multiple treatment plants in six sewerage districts, the opportunity for private\nsector involvement is limited at this time. Nevertheless, TMG expressed interest in inviting\nprivate sponsors using other private sector participation modalities for future projects.\n                                                \n33\n TA 2504-PRC: Seminar on BOT in the Water Supply Sector, for $100,000, approved on 22 December 1995.\n34\n TA 2804-PRC: Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Chengdu Water Supply, for $600,000, approved on 2 June 1997.\n35Loan 1669-PRC: The Chengdu Generale des Eaux-Marubeni Project, for $26.5 million, approved on 11 February\n1999.\n36\nThe positive financial performance of joint venture water bottling enterprises in Indonesia was cited as an example\nof successful private sector participation.\n37\n ADB has supported private sector participation in the PRC water supply sector through TA 2504-PRC and 2804-\nPRC (footnotes 33 and 34).", "15\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n61.  The vision of Tianjin is to advance toward becoming a modern, flourishing, prosperous,\nand beautiful industrial metropolis. A major thrust of urban planning and development in Tianjin\nhas been to improve the densely-settled urban environment in the city center. This has included\nrelocating industry, promoting new industrial developments, and encouraging the development\nof  clean  and  high-technology  industry.  The  city  has  been  successful  in  managing  rapid\ndevelopment, with a doubling and tripling of various economic and industrial sectors during\n1993-1997. Continued economic growth is crucial to poverty alleviation within the city. Improved\nwastewater management and environmental protection of the city's sole raw water source are\nessential for rapid economic growth to continue and to be sustainable. The Project comprises\ntwo components that support these goals\u2014wastewater collection and treatment in the Beicang\narea of Tianjin and water resources protection (WRP) for the Luan-Tianjin water diversion\nsystem. Both components are identified as high priority interventions within the HRPPCP and\nwill facilitate the sustainable economic development of urban Tianjin.\n62.  Wastewater  collection  and  treatment  projects  in  general,  and  the  Beicang  WWT\ncomponent  in  particular,  are  important  to  Tianjin  for  three  reasons:  (i)  within  the  local\nwastewater service areas, improved wastewater services will enhance urban environmental and\npublic health conditions; (ii) the Hai River Basin is highly polluted by upstream sources and\ndrains through Tianjin; the city must shoulder its responsibilities in wastewater management to\nencourage and demand improved wastewater management by the upstream polluters, located\nprimarily in Hebei Province and in Beijing; and (iii) in coordination with other externally-funded\nwastewater  projects,  the  WWT  component  will  contribute  to  a  comprehensive  wastewater\nmanagement program and achievement of environmental benefits to the densely developed city\ncenter area. Implementation of the wastewater management program will also help mitigate the\npollution loading in Bohai Bay, a key marine and fisheries resource that increasingly suffers\nfrom red tide and other detrimental effects of untreated wastewater effluent.\n63.  All of the major urban areas of Tianjin are served almost exclusively by a single raw\nwater supply source, the Luan-Tianjin water diversion system. The 5 million people served by\nthis system are currently at risk from pollution arising at various locations: within the Luan and Li\nriver basins in Hebei Province, and within the Zhou River watershed downstream from Yuqiao\nReservoir. The existing problems have highlighted the risk to Tianjin's image as a modern\nthriving metropolis that can effectively manage its water supply system and provide a safe,\nclean water supply. The WRP component will eliminate the sources of pollution to the raw water\nsystem that are within Tianjin's control, and lend credibility to Tianjin's demands for pollution\ncontrol of the upstream pollution sources in Hebei Province.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n64.  The main objectives of the Project are to improve the urban environment, by reducing\nenvironmental contamination through improved wastewater management, and the quality of raw\nwater supply in Tianjin City. Related objectives include (i) strengthening the capacity of the\nwastewater and raw water supply operations to be more efficient and managed on commercial\nprinciples;  (ii)  introducing  comprehensive  approaches  to  watershed  management;  and  (iii)\nimproving cost recovery from users through an improved tariff structure, with gradual increases\nto achieve full cost recovery.\n65.  The  Project  has  two  parts.  Part  A  (WWT)  consists  of  wastewater  collection  and\ntreatment, and Part B (WRP) consists of protecting the raw water supply for the Tianjin City", "16\ncenter suburbs and coastal districts. The objectives of the WWT component are to (i) provide for\nWWT in a service area that currently discharges raw sewage to surface waters (over 50,000\ncubic meters [m3]/day), and for future customers who will be connected to existing and new\nsewers;  (ii)  adhere  to  the  HRPPCP,  which  requires  implementation  of  WWT  construction\nprojects by 31 December 2000; and (iii) help improve the Yongdingxin River water quality to\nmeet  a  minimum  class  V  (footnote  10)  standard  required  by  government  regulation.  The\nobjectives of the WRP component are to (i) provide increased protection from pollution for the\nraw water supply for approximately 5 million people in urban and coastal Tianjin; and (ii) provide\nmeans  for  the  raw  water  quality  to  meet  class  III  standard,  as  required  by  government\nregulation. Resettlement impacts addressed under the Project include physical relocation of 12\nhouseholds,  permanent  land  acquisition  affecting  900  households,  and  temporary  land\nacquisition affecting 1,591 households.\n1. Part A: Wastewater Collection and Treatment Component\n66.  The WWT component will provide wastewater facilities within the Beicang service area\nof urban Tianjin. The component will provide trunk sewers and four sewage pump stations to\nserve the newly-developing portion of Beicang, and a WWT plant to serve the eastern portion\nand the existing sewered area in the central portion of Beicang. The facilities include (i) 15.2\nkilometers (km) of sewer mains, 300 millimeters (mm) to 1500 mm in diameter; (ii) 0.8 km of\neffluent mains, 1800 mm diameter; (iii) four pump stations, ranging in capacity from 6,000 to\n15,000 m3/d, and pumping heads ranging from 6 to 12 meters (m); and (iv) the Phase I Beicang\nWWT plant of 100,000 m3/day capacity to handle the projected flows in 2010, expandable in the\nfuture to 250,000 m3/day, and using an \u201cA/O\u201d biological treatment process. The \u201cA/O\u201d process\nuses a combination of anaerobic and oxic conditions to reduce pollutants and phosphorous in\nthe wastewater.\n2. Part B: Water Resources Protection Component\n67.  The existing Luan-Tianjin water diversion system is the source of potable water for the\nTianjin central urban area containing 4 million people. It also provides raw water to six coastal\nand suburban water supply systems and to industries along the Hai River near the city center.\nThe existing system stretches 234 km from the Panda reservoirs on the Luan River in Hebei\nProvince to the Xiankai River Waterworks, one of the three large water treatment plants within\nurban Tianjin. The existing raw water system was developed in response to severe water\nshortages and deteriorated water quality in the Tianjin urban water supply system.\n68.  The WRP component encompasses three major elements of the Luan-Tianjin water\ndiversion project: (i) improvements to reduce water pollution within the Yuqiao Reservoir; (ii) a\nnew  closed  pressurized  box  culvert  to  carry  raw  water  from  Yuqiao  Reservoir  to  the\nJiuwangzhuang Gate to avoid pollution of the water from the Zhou River and reduce water\nlosses; and (iii) improvements to the existing open channel from the Jiuwangzhuang Gate to the\nDazhangzhuang Pump Station.\n69.  Water quality in the Yuqiao Reservoir will be protected and improved by (i) planting of\nappropriate  vegetation  within  various  ranges  of  ground  elevation;  (ii)  improvements  or\nrestrictions in land use within a strip of land along the edge of the reservoir, extending 51 km\nalong the lakeside with an area of 36 square kilometers (km2); (iii) construction of low dams on\nsmall  tributaries  to  retard  soil  erosion  and  reduce  flow  velocities  that  can  carry  polluting\nsubstances into the reservoir; (iv) wastewater conveyance and treatment systems (by open\nchannels and stabilization ponds) for rural villages, coupled with improvements in wastewater\npretreatment in hospitals and enterprises, and improvements in the handling and treatment of\nnightsoil, manure, and solid wastes; (v) elimination of 730 hectares (ha) of fishponds in the", "17\nreservoir and below a ground elevation of 22 m; and (vi) improvement of fish ponds behind a\nprotective dike within the reservoir.\n70.  The new Zhou River channel sections will consist of pressurized, reinforced concrete\nculverts. Additional siphons and channels will be required to divert drainage and flood flows\nabove or under the box culvert. A diversion gate will be installed at Yuqiao Reservoir, to divert\nflows to the new closed culvert, and a siphon will be installed under the spillway channel.\n71.  Improvements to the existing open channel will consist primarily of installing a lining on\nthe side slopes and bottom of the channel, and will involve repair of existing sections having\nmortared  stone  lining,  or  installation  of  precast  concrete  panels.  Other  measures  include\nremoval of sediment from the channel bottom; repair of leaking siphons; rebuilding of leaking\ngates at two locations; and provision of a patrol road, buffer strip, and fences to isolate the\nchannel from adjacent towns and highways.\n72.  The WRP component also addresses comprehensive watershed management within the\nTianjin portion of the Yuqiao Reservoir watershed. The Luan-Tianjin diversion channels extend\nabout 100 km from the Yuqiao Reservoir to Tianjin's urban areas, a distance that is too long to\nadequately police and control to prevent pollution and water theft. Further, Jixian County, which\ncovers both the Yuqiao and Zhou River watersheds, continues to develop its agricultural and\nindustrial  base,  yet  lags  far  behind  in  terms  of  industrial  and  municipal  wastewater\nmanagement. The improvements, including watershed protection within Yuqiao Reservoir and a\nclosed box culvert for the 34 km section downstream of the reservoir, will reduce the future\npollution risks to a more manageable level.\nC. Technical Justification\n73.  Under Part A of the Project, the Beicang WWT plant, pumping stations, and sewers fit\ninto an overall wastewater system improvement and expansion program to be partially funded\nby external assistance agencies. The component is the first of many WWT plants and related\nprojects to be carried out under the HRPPCP. It will provide for the treatment of wastewater\ndischarges that are presently dumped untreated into ditches and a raw sewage canal, and it will\nprovide for the collection and treatment of new connections as growth occurs.\n74.  The service area for the Beicang WWT plant was confirmed during project processing\nand was approved at the Government level. Some of the factors involved in confirming the\ndecision were: (i) networks in the city were implemented in the early years of development and\nexpanded along growth patterns; (ii) the siting of the six existing service areas was influenced\nby topographical constraints such as the Hai River; (iii) the flat terrain in the city requires\npumping  stations  for  conveyance,  and  a  reasonable  balance  between  sewer  depths  and\npumping facilities is achieved by dividing the city into multiple service areas; and (iv) multiple\nWWT plants (a) avoid major cross-city conveyance systems and related pumping costs; (b)\nallow flexibility to better match plant size with growth; and (c) allow for an areal distribution of\neffluent discharges, thereby spreading the residual pollutant load to the receiving waters in\nTianjin. The basis for the Beicang WWT plant is considered sound.\n75.  In the feasibility study and the TA work, alternatives were evaluated in deciding upon the\nWWT  components,  the  WWT  plant  process,  and  sewer  routings  and  sizes.  The  WWT\ncomponent is technically justified because it will provide for a high level of WWT of existing and\nfuture domestic and industrial wastewater from a major area in urban Tianjin. The estimated\nleast-cost option for the WWT plant process and the sewer system were selected for the\ncomponent.", "18\n76.  Part  B,  the  WRP  component,  addresses  the  challenge  of  providing  clean  water  in\nadequate quantities and of acceptable quality. The area does not possess adequate water\nresources to sustain needs, and the import of water from outside Tianjin is necessary. The\nsituation will worsen as demands increase with economic growth. While additional sources of\ninterbasin transfers, desalination, and wastewater reuse are available, the incremental cost of\nthese is much greater than maximizing use of presently available surface water sources. Hence,\nprotection of this source is extremely important and leads to broader environmental benefits not\nfound in alternative approaches.\n77.  The  existing  system,  developed  as  a  result  of  decreasing  groundwater  availability\nbecause of salinity and subsidence problems and growth demands from urban development,\nrequires corrective measures if the system is to continue to be viable. The Yuqiao Reservoir,\noriginally designed for flood control and irrigation and not water supply, needs to be physically\nimproved and operationally controlled as a water supply source. Present pollution loads entering\nthe water body and in-reservoir activities are not acceptable. In the Zhou River section, natural\ndrainage, with attendant domestic sewerage, industrial waste flows, and agricultural run-off, was\ngated to prevent contamination of the water supply flowing down the river section. This is not\neffective,  especially  during  flood  season.  The  unlined  water  supply  open  channel  has\nexperienced problems with erosion, infiltration of pollution, and some exfiltration, as the water\nlevels in the open channel are below the prevailing groundwater levels. The groundwater has a\nhigh concentration of chlorides, since there is no drainage system for irrigation return flows. The\nproposed component addresses these problems and provides reasonable solutions.\n78.  The WRP component is technically justified because it provides basic protection of\nTianjin's  sole  public  water  supply  against  existing  and  increasing  pollution.  The  WRP\ncomponent is the least-cost option to achieve the desired level of pollution risk reduction in the\nZhou River section. A box culvert was selected rather than an open channels. While costing\nmore, it provides the minimum acceptable level of risk of pollution of the raw water in that\nsection. The least-cost closed conduit option has been selected. The component addresses the\nproblems of (i) nutrient loads fostering algae growth with its attendant impact on water treatment\noperations; (ii) exposure to biological pollution from domestic sources and chemical pollution\nfrom industrial sources in Tianjin-controlled areas; (iii) water losses from the conveyance system\nbecause there will be no need to flush sections of the Zhou River, and there will be less leakage\nfrom the existing open channel section; and (iv) the need for continued isolation of drainage\nsections along the Zhou River section. This last aspect of the component will allow normal\ndrainage conditions for about 40,000 of agricultural land, adding significantly to the amount of\nagriculturally-productive land in the Tianjin area. Under the TA study, a revised forecast of raw\nwater supply from the Luan-Tianjin diversion system was prepared, indicating full use of the\nsystem by 2010.\n79.  TML  obtains  water  from  the  Luan  River  in  Hebei  Province  through  allocations\ndetermined by MWR and formalized under the terms of an administration circular issued by the\nState Council on 12 June 1983. This circular determines the water allocation from the Panda\nreservoirs that has to be shared between Tianjin and Hebei Province. It provides for 1.0 billion\nm3 of water to be available to Tianjin on an annual basis. This compares to Tianjin's average\ncurrent requirements from the Luan river source of 500 million m3 per annum and indicates the\nsource of water is relatively well assured. The price of this water is fixed by the Government-\nlevel pricing authorities under the auspices of SDPC and in consultation with MWR. TMG has\naccepted that any change in this purchase price would also need to be reflected in the price\nTML sells raw water in order to maintain full cost recovery for its services. As TML is the sole\nprovider of raw water to TWSC and other bulk users of water in Tianjin, formalized water\npurchase agreements are not considered necessary. The sale price of water will be reviewed", "19\nand adjusted periodically by SDPC and MWR in accordance with price regulations contained\nwithin State Circular 1985 (44), which governs the pricing of water conservancy projects. These\nregulations provide for raw water prices to be fixed on the basis of full cost recovery together\nwith an allowable profit of 4-6 percent of capital employed.\nD. Cost Estimates\n80.  The project cost is estimated at $340.7 million equivalent, comprising $169.2 million in\nforeign exchange costs (49 percent) and $171.5 million equivalent in local currency costs. A\nsummary of cost estimates is given in Table 1. Cost tables are included in Appendix 3.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n81.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $130.0 million, about 38 percent of the total\nproject costs. The loan will finance 77 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The\nbalance of the required foreign exchange and local currency requirements will be provided by\nTMG as equity, and through cofinancing by a loan from the China Development Bank. The\nfinancing plan for the Project is in Table 2. The loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources at ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate for loans from the US dollar facility, with a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum and a front-end fee of 1.0 percent. The loan will\nhave a maturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The Borrower will be the PRC.\n82.  The Borrower will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to TMG on the same terms and\nconditions as the ADB loan. TMG will onlend the loan proceeds to TSC and TML through\nonlending  agreements  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  These  two\ncompanies will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for ADB\u2019s loan and\nreimburse TMG for any intermediation and transaction costs.

The Executing Agency\n83.  Tianjin Municipal Government will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The project\nmanagement office (PMO), under the direction of a project leading group, will be responsible for\nadministering all matters related to the Project. TMG has established a leading group and an\nadministrative  office  to  coordinate  all  activities  related  to  the  Project.  The  Leading  Group,\nheaded by the Deputy Executive Mayor of Tianjin City, will provide guidance to the Project.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. The Implementing Agencies\n84.  The day-to-day implementation of Parts A and B of the Project will be carried out by TSC\nand TML. During project implementation, TSC and TML will be supported by experienced\ndomestic and international consultants. The PMO and the project implementing agencies (PIAs)\nwill retain the services of procurement agencies for the civil works contracts, mechanical and\nelectrical equipment, and materials. The PIAs will have a number of their staff trained in project\nimplementation. TSC and TML staff need to strengthen their expertise in (i) efficient operating\nprocedures; (ii) preventive maintenance; (iii) administration, accounting, financial planning, and\nmanagement;  (iv)  social  and  environmental  monitoring;  (v)  business  planning;  (vi)  human\nresources development; and (vii) cost recovery aspects, including cost control measures and\ntariff review and methodologies to determine adjustments reflecting the impact of inflation and\ncurrency fluctuations. Capacity building for the PIAs will be achieved through consultant inputs,\nhands-on training on project facilities, training in the PRC, and possible international training\nfinanced from the loan.\na. Legal Status and Corporate Structure of Project Implementing\nAgencies\n85.  TSC was registered as a state-owned enterprise in May 1996, and is a registered\ncompany with a total of 3,500 staff, 2,500 of which work on sewerage operations. TSC was\nestablished through a transfer of assets and staffing from the former Sewerage Management\nDepartment of the Tianjin Engineering Management Bureau and its formation was initially a\ncondition of a World Bank loan agreement. The new Beicang WWT plant and associated\nsewerage system extension will require TSC to hire about 200 more staff, although some of the\nneeded staff are expected to be made available through redeployment.", "21\n86.  TML  was  registered  as  a  state-owned  enterprise  on  13  January  2000,  with  initial\nregistered capital of Y200 million ($24 million). The company is wholly owned by TMG under the\ndirection of Tianjin Water Conservancy Bureau.\n87.  During implementation, the management of TSC and TML will be held accountable for\nsetting and managing an annual budget and meeting construction and other implementation\ndeadlines. Once implementation has been completed, the companies will be responsible for all\naspects related to operations.\nb. Financial Performance and Projections\n88.  TSC and TML were established to construct38 and operate facilities for WWT and WRP.\nAll  costs  associated  with  the  current  operations  of  the  companies  will  be  capitalized  as\npreoperating and capital expenditures. Financial projections from 1 January 2006 for TSC and\nfor the first full year of operations for TML, and the critical assumptions, are given in Appendix 5.\nThe financial projections, based on water and wastewater demand projections and incorporating\nthe projected tariff increases for raw water and wastewater tariffs required under the Project,\nindicate sound levels of financial performance. Cash flows are sufficient to meet all operating\ncosts and debt and equity servicing requirements. Targeted ratios have been estimated and\nhave been covenanted in the loan agreement. The financial indicators for the two companies\nare summarized in Table 3.\nTable 3: Projected Financial Indicators (2006-2010)\nItem 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nA. TSC\n1.

Purchase of the water from the Panda reservoirs by the Tianjin and Hebei governments\nis governed by terms and conditions stipulated in State Council Circular 44 of 12 June 1983.\nDetails of the existing agreement include (i) a price set at Y0.108/m3; (ii) average purchase\nvolume of 553 million m3/year; (iii) water guarantee based on 1 billion m3 being available to\nTianjin (excluding water committed to Hebei Province) with good reliability; (iv) there is no\nminimum purchase amount, and water is taken as needed.\n90.  Water is sold by Tianjin Luan River Diversion Bureau to TML under a water supply\nagreement. The intention is for this agreement to remain unchanged and to be taken over by\nTML, except that the price of raw water sold by TML will need to increase to finance Luan River\nDiversion improvements. Details of the existing agreement include (i) price set at Y0.40/m3 for\nurban water supplies and industrial supply with no return to the Hai River; and Y0.13/m3 for\nsupplies  with  discharge  return  to  the  Hai  River  (cooling  water);  (ii)  Tianjin  Water  Supply\nCompany to take an average of 550 million m3/year; and (iii) no minimum purchase amount.\nThese tariffs became effective on 1 November 1999, raised from Y.025/m3 and Y0.10/m3,\nrespectively, an increase of about 62 percent. The water tariff will have to be reviewed regularly\n                                                \n38\nUnder PRC requirements, all projects financed from external sources must be implemented by a company\nspecifically established for this purpose so as to foster commercial principles and accountability.", "22\nto ensure regularly that adequate provision is made to reflect increases that may occur in the\noperating costs, including increases in water resources fees and other charges.\n2. Project Management\n91.  A project management office (PMO) has been established under the Tianjin Municipal\nDevelopment Planning Commission through official notification. The PMO will be the secretariat\nof the steering committee and will liaise with the administrative office of TMG. The PMO will\ninclude a project director, a full-time deputy director, five full-time professional staff, and support\nstaff. The PMO will manage and coordinate the work of the two PIAs (TSC and TML) through\ntheir respective project implementation units. Each PIA will set up project implementation units,\nheaded by general managers, to coordinate with the PMO and facilitate timely implementation\nof project activities. PIAs will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation activities. An\norganization chart is provided in Appendix 6.\n3. Performance Contracts\n92.  Formal performance contracts between TMG and the PIAs will define the relationships\nbetween each party and detail the strategic requirements placed on the PIAs. The performance\ncontracts include business plans and institutional and management development action plans,\nand address service levels, strategic targets, and other operational aspects. The performance\nframework contracts are given as a supplementary appendix.\n4. Project Implementation Schedule\n93.  The Project will be implemented over a period of five years (Appendix 7). This schedule\nis considered realistic because the project implementation structure is already in place, and\npreparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s successful experience in similar projects in the PRC\nand the TMG\u2019s in-depth knowledge and experience in wastewater pollution control, raw water\nprotection, and supply projects indicates that this schedule is realistic and achievable.\n5. Consulting Services\n94.  The PIAs will retain the services of competent and experienced design institutes to\ncomplete the feasibility studies, preliminary design, detailed designs, and specifications. These\nconsultants will be recruited through standard PRC procedures acceptable to ADB. In addition,\nthe PIAs will retain the services of tendering agencies, following standard PRC procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB,  to  help  prepare  tendering,  contract  documents,  and  local  competitive\nbidding procedures for (i) the prequalification of contractors; (ii) tendering and bid evaluation for\nthe procurement of various equipment, materials, and civil works contract packages; and (iii)\nprovision of qualified construction supervision companies for each part of the Project. The\nselection of the consultants for design, tendering, and construction supervision will be subject to\nADB approval with respect to their competence and experience for each assignment and will be\nfunded the counterpart funds.\n95.  In addition, provision has been made for 65 person-months of international and 130\nperson-months of domestic consulting services to support the PMO and the PIAs in project\nimplementation and capacity building to be funded under the loan. These consultants will provide\nassistance to the PMO in the areas of ADB procedures and reporting, international specifications,\ndesign and construction, tendering procedures, evaluation of bids, standard contracts, quality\ncontrol, and the project performance management system (PPMS). The consultants will provide\nadvice,  guidance,  and  training  for  capacity  building  necessary  to  convert  the  PIAs  from\nconstruction into operating companies upon completion of implementation. International consulting\nwill be provided for (i) the development of a corporate management structure; (ii) training in the", "23\ndevelopment of standardized financial and accounting statements; (iii) midterm and final review of\nretail  water  and  wastewater  tariffs;  (iv)  monitoring  of  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental\nimpacts; and (v) advice on the method and procedures for benefit monitoring and resettlement.\nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 8. In addition to\ntraining provided by consultants, the PIAs will use loan funds to finance broader training-related\nexpenses. The PIAs will submit detailed training programs and budgets for ADB approval prior\nto proceeding with such training activities. Disbursements for approved training expenditures will\nbe through the imprest account (para. 97).\n6. Procurement\n96.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement. Major contracts for equipment will be undertaken through ADB\u2019s international\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures,  and  equipment  packages  valued  under  $500,000  will  be\nprocured following ADB\u2019s procedures for international shopping. Civil works estimated to cost\nbelow  $8  million  per  package  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)\nprocedures acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law\nand procurement regulations.39 Local contractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake\nsuch works. Since such civil works will involve mainly labor costs, international contractors are\nnot  likely  to  be  interested  in  the  work  and  the  use  of  LCB  is  considered  acceptable.  In\naccordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in the bidding for LCB\ncontracts. The major construction materials will be purchased through international competitive\nbidding  procedures  and  financed  by  the  ADB  loan.  Indicative  procurement  packages  are\nprovided in Appendix 9. The mode of procurement will be decided by TMG in consultation with\nADB.  The  internationally  tendered  equipment  packages  will  include  the  technical  support\nnecessary for ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational\nstaff as part of the related contracts. This approach is the most efficient way to ensure quality\ncontrol during installation and proper operational training in the use of the equipment as the\nmanufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 technical experts will be the people most familiar with all aspects\nof the equipment.\n7. Disbursement\n97.  To facilitate disbursements for numerous small expenditures, an imprest account will be\nestablished after loan effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\n(June 1996). Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by an appropriate\nwithdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will  demonstrate,\namong other things, that the goods and/or services were (i) produced in and procured from\nADB's members, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into the\nimprest account will not exceed $300,000. The statement of expenditure procedure may be\nused for reimbursement of eligible expenditures; any individual contract to be reimbursed or\nliquidated under the procedure will not exceed $50,000.\n                                                \n39\nADB assisted in the establishment of national procurement regulations for the public sector under TA 2845-PRC:\nEstablishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved on 20 August\n1997, including the drafting of six regulations and three sample bidding documents.", "24\n8.  Advance Procurement and Recruitment Action\n98.  Advance action was approved on 5 June 2000 to expedite project implementation.\nAdvance action, which may take place prior to loan effectiveness, includes (i) prequalification of\ncontractors, tendering and bid evaluation for civil work contract packages; (ii) preparation of\ntender documents for the procurement of materials, plant, equipment, and vehicles; and (iii)\nrecruitment of domestic and international consultants for construction supervision and training.\nTML and TSC were advised that issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under advance\nprocurement action was subject to approval by the ADB. All advance procurement actions will\nbe  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on Procurement,  and  advance\nrecruitment of consultants will be carried out in conformity with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants. The Government, TML and TSC were advised that approval of advance action\ndoes not commit the ADB to finance the Project. This action was reported in the June issue of\nADB Business Opportunities.\n9. Operation and Maintenance\n99.  All permanent works constructed under the Project will be owned by TSC and TML for\ntheir respective components, and each company will each be responsible for the O&M of its\ncomponent. Prior to commissioning of the works, both companies will recruit any necessary\nadditional personnel. Appropriate training will be provided to any new personnel.\n10. Project Reviews\n100.  In addition to the normal periodic reviews, a midterm review will be undertaken by ADB\nand the Government two years after project implementation begins. This review will include a\ndetailed evaluation of the scope, implementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of\nscheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the  agenda  for  policy  reform  and  capacity  building\nmeasures. A detailed review of the wholesale water prices for the Project, as well as retail level\ntariffs, will be undertaken. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed.\n11. Anticorruption\n101.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to\nobserve the highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed\ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption\nprovisions in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\n102.  The PRC country assistance plan includes assistance that will improve governance and\nprovide incentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. The TA for the\nPRC\u2019s procurement regulations (footnote 39) provided assistance to draft procurement and\nstandard bidding documents. In 1998 ADB provided TA40 to help strengthen the Government\u2019s\nauditing standards. The goal of that TA is to strengthen the Government\u2019s auditing system to\nconform with the requirements of the audit law, and as far as practicable, international auditing\nstandards. The TA helped (i) formulate Government auditing standards and procedures, and (ii)\ndesign  and  implement  an  audit-training  program  to  promote  adherence  to  such  auditing\nstandards and procedures by Government auditors.\n                                                \n40\nTA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.", "25\n12. Reports and Auditing\n103.  The PMO and the PIAs will maintain separate accounts for Parts A and B of the Project.\nThe PIAs will maintain records of all project expenditures and forward these regularly to the\nPMO,  and  the  PMO  will  prepare  consolidated  project  accounts.  The  consolidated  project\naccounts will be audited annually by the Tianjin Municipal Audit Bureau and by independent\nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  such  audited  accounts  in  English  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB not later than six months after the end of the financial year to which they\nrelate. As the ADB loan will be onlent to the PIAs, audited financial statements of the two PIAs\nwill be submitted to ADB annually also no later than six months after the end of the relevant\nfinancial year. The PMO will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of the\nloan proceeds, the Project, and the administration and financial information of the PIAs. The\nreports will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports;\nand (iii) a project completion report, not later than three months after completion of the Project.\nProgress reports will emphasize progress made in the areas of policy dialogue, including (i)\nwater  and  wastewater  tariff  changes,  (ii)  environmental  and  water  quality  monitoring,  (iii)\nresettlement, and (iv) capacity building and financial management of TSC and TML.\n104.  As a result of policy dialogue during project processing, audit committees of the board of\ndirectors of the PIAs will be established. The committees will review internal and external audit\nreports and consider other issues of corporate governance. Each audit committee will meet at\nleast once every six months.\n13. Project Performance Management System\n105.  The PPMS will be integrated into the project management information system of the\nPMO and linked to the two PIAs. Indicators that have been agreed on include service levels,\ntreated water quality, incidence of water-related diseases, water consumption, user satisfaction,\nand other economic data to monitor project impacts on improved living conditions and economic\nopportunities related to (i) improved water supply and sewage treatment facilities and services,\n(ii)  improved  quality  of  life,  (iii)  resettlement,  (iv)  physical  completion,  (v)  institutional\nstrengthening, and (vi) policy reforms. At the beginning of the Project, the PMO and PIAs, with\nthe assistance of consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically\ngenerate data on inputs and outputs of the two project components and socioeconomic and\nenvironmental indicators to measure project impacts. The PMO and PIAs will refine the PPMS\nframework, confirm achievable goals, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and\nestablish systems and procedures no later than six months after loan effectiveness.\n106.  Under  the  PPMS  framework,  baseline  and  annual  data  will  be  reported  at  regular\nintervals by each PIA. Each PIA will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data\nthrough its management information system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate\nflexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and\ndevelopment impacts. The PMO, with the assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess\nactivities, and report to ADB quarterly on the physical implementation and financial aspects of\nthe Project to ensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n107.  As the Project is classified as a Category A environmental project, an environmental\nimpact assessment (EIA) is required. In accordance with the PRC environmental laws and\nguidelines, EIA outlines and reports have been prepared for each project component. The EIA", "26\nreports for the WWT and WRP components have been approved by SEPA. The summary EIA\nwas prepared and circulated to the ADB Board on 28 February 2000.\n108.  The EIAs conclude that the Project will have substantial positive environmental benefits\nfor the environmental quality and the quality of drinking water in Tianjin City, and, with the\nplanned mitigation measures in place, will have an insignificant adverse impact on the physical\nand natural environment. The Project will improve the living environment of residents in areas it\nserves and make appreciable contributions to the water pollution control program of the Hai\nRiver Basin. The Project will safeguard the drinking water quality of Tianjin's sole water supply\nsource, help to create conditions to raise living standards, and improve public health conditions\nfor residents. The WWT component is an important link in the implementation of the overall\nsewerage development plan for urban Tianjin.\n109.  The WWT component includes a secondary WWT plant that will serve the Beichen\ndistrict,  an  urban  district  with  rapid  industrial  and  commercial  development  without  WWT\nfacilities. The biological treatment process selected (para. 66) is highly efficient at removing\nphosphorus. Bohai Bay has experienced increasingly serious occurrences of red tide due to\nexcessive nutrient (especially phosphorus) loading.\n110.  Sludge disposal is one of the most significant aspects of WWT operations. Dewatered\nsludge from TSC\u2019s Dongjao WWT plant is presently given to farmers for agricultural uses since\nits quality meets the relevant standard. Two options will be provided for sludge disposal: (i) for\nagricultural use, if the quality meets the standard; and (ii) shipping the dewatered sludge to a\nlandfill at the Xianyang Road WWT plant when, in exceptional cases, the quality does not meet\nthe standard.\n111.  SEPA  has  issued  a  deadline  of  31  December  2000  for  all  industrial  wastewater\ndischargers in the PRC to meet the relevant standards, including pretreatment requirements.\nThose that fail to do this will face factory closure or production reduction. TMG set its own\ndeadline as 31 December 1999. So far, over 800 industries in Tianjin have complied, while 24\nfactories have been closed and 24 other factories have had their production levels reduced.\nThroughout the Luan River diversion project area, which includes upstream areas in Hebei\nProvince, more than 40 factories have complied. Intensive pollution monitoring is undertaken in\nthe Yuquiao Reservoir area. Tianjin\u2019s efforts and achievements on industrial pollution control\nhave been commended by SEPA. To address transjurisdictional pollution, TMG is coordinating\nwith the Hai River Basin Commission and the Hebei government on the control of phosphorus\nemission from two major fertilizer plants in Zunhua municipality, Hebei Province.\n112.  Industrial wastewater discharging into municipal sewer systems is monitored four times\na year, twice by TEPB and twice by local environmental quality monitoring stations. Industrial\nestablishments, however, monitor their discharges sometimes as frequently as several times a\nday depending on their size. In accordance with international practice, TSC plans to undertake a\ncomprehensive monitoring program of its own with a higher frequency, especially for larger\ndischargers and those with highly polluting wastewater. This will ensure compliance, resulting in\nbetter quality of sludge and plant effluent, greatly enhancing their reuse potential.\n113.  The  effluent  from  the  proposed  Beicang  WWT  plant  will  be  discharged  into  the\nYongdingxin  River.  To  avoid  pollution  from  raw  sewage  being  pumped  from  the  Beicang\nsewerage catchment area into the river at the present time, a small portion of the river channel\nwas separated from the main channel, which preserves the water quality in the main channel for\nirrigation. With the operation of the Beicang WWT plant, its effluent quality will also meet the\nrequirement for irrigation use. The addition of the effluent to the storage system behind the\nchannel's weir, for use during the dry season, represents a potential increase of irrigated area\nby 5,500 ha. This arrangement will reduce pollution discharge to Bohai Bay.", "27\n114.  With the construction of the new closed conduit channel, the Zhou River stretch will\nrevert to its original function to carry away storm runoff and wastewater from neighboring\ncommunities as well as its base flow. At present, because this stretch is used for water supply\ndiversion, these communities suffer from the accumulation of wastewater in ponds and ditches,\nresulting in an undesirable living environment, increased incidence of waterborne diseases, and\nthreats to public health. The new closed conduit will appreciably improve the environment of the\naffected area.\n115.  The  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mainly  associated  with  the\nconstruction phase. These impacts are shortterm and relate to noise, vibration, air pollution,\nrunoff,  safety  hazards,  disposal  of  construction  debris,  and  localized  traffic  congestion.\nAppropriate mitigation measures will be incorporated into the detailed engineering designs and\nconstruction contracts. The PIAs, in cooperation with TEPB, will monitor construction contracts\nand enforce compliance with environmental regulations and standards.\n116.  The  Tianjin  Environmental  Monitoring  Center  (TEMC)  of  TEPB  is  well  equipped  to\nundertake environmental quality monitoring for the Project. TEMC, with 200 staff, has offices for\nintegrated  planning,  technical  development,  water  environment,  atmospheric  environment,\ninstrumentation, physics (noise and vibration), soil ecology (including solid waste), and traffic\npollution monitoring. TEMC is certified by the State Technical Standards Bureau for analytical\nquality assurance and control and the certification is renewed every five years to ensure the\nmaintenance of good practice. The certification ensures the accuracy of analytical results and\ngives legal standing to the results. The main task in the Project for TEMC will be to (i) carry out\nthe monitoring programs for the construction, start-up, and operations phases; and (ii) prepare\nreports on relevant monitoring work by the local environmental quality monitoring stations.\n2. Public Participation\n117.  Direct public involvement has been ongoing throughout the development and design of\nthe  Project.  During  preparation  of  the  EIA,  public  participation  occurred  during  (i)  site\ninvestigations for facilities, (ii) the preparation of social impact assessments, (iii) the evaluation\nof priorities and estimation of the value of benefits, and (iv) community surveys undertaken to\ngauge public reactions to the Project. One hundred questionnaires were distributed to people\nliving near the WWT plant site. The response rate was 89 percent and 94 percent of the\nrespondents expressed support for the component. Questionnaires (828) were distributed to\npeople living within the WRP component area. The response rate was 88 percent, with 99\npercent of the respondents from the urban area of TMG stating that the component is important.\n3. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n118.  Tianjin Municipal Development Planning Commission, in collaboration with consultants,\nprepared the project resettlement plan (RP). Both components involve land acquisition and\nresettlement effects, and a comprehensive RP has been prepared for the Project on the basis of\nthe feasibility studies. The RP will comply with the 1998 Land Administration Law, which was\ndrafted with ADB assistance, for the WWT component, and the 1991 MWR Regulations for\nMedium and Large Water Hydropower Project Construction, for the WRP component. The RP\nprovides compensation and other assistance to people affected including both legal and illegal\nland users. The summary resettlement plan (SRP), given in Appendix 10, provides detailed\ninformation for each project component. The RP will be reviewed, revised, and appropriately\nmodified after the preliminary technical design for each component has been finalized. Copies\nof the revised RP will be submitted to ADB prior to commencement of land clearing. This will\ninclude livelihood restoration plans. Affected people (APs) have been consulted, and a detailed\nconsultation plan is included in the RP. The PIAs released the Chinese version of the SRP to", "28\nthe districts and counties for release to the affected township offices and review by APs before\nloan negotiations. TMG agreed to post the SRP on the ADB website and to make the SRP\npublicly available through affected township offices, for review by APs prior to loan negotiations.\n119.  The 45 villages around the Yuqiao Reservoir will be affected, 80 villages will be affected\nby the upgrade of the existing channel and the Zhou River diversion channel, and one township\nwill be affected to accommodate the Beicang WWT plant. Permanent land acquisition of 430 ha\nwill be required affecting over 3,000 APs in 900 households. Temporary land acquisition will\nimpact 550 ha (with 6,367 APs in 1,591 households). Physical relocation of 12 households (56\nAPs)  is  expected.  The  Project  will  eliminate  960  ha  of  fishponds  (with  1,280  APs  in  430\nhouseholds). No community structures or public institutions will be affected by the Project.\nRestrictions in the Yuqiao Reservoir buffer zone are not expected to have any adverse impact\non land use or yields and therefore no loss of livelihood is anticipated for people in this area.\n120.  The organization and management structure of the PIAs are adequate to implement the\nRP. The key agencies involved in the preparation of the RP are represented in the relevant\ndepartments within each PIA, which should ensure effective coordination and implementation.\nThe PIAs will ensure that all implementing personnel are briefed fully on the RP. In addition to\nthe internal monitoring carried out by TSC and TML, a qualified institute will be selected to\nundertake independent monitoring and evaluation of resettlement impacts. Entitlements will be\nprovided to the APs in full before demolition and ground leveling commence, and before any\nloss of land takes place. The county and township resettlement offices will play an important\nrole in briefing the township and village personnel on RP provisions; making the RP public;\nensuring that APs are aware of compensation entitlements, job creation schemes, training\nactivities, and relocation sites; and reflecting the APs\u2019 comments and concerns in the revised\nRP and during its implementation. These offices will ensure that all compensation payments and\nother specified assistance will be paid directly to the collectives, enterprises, and individuals\naffected, and there will not be any deductions in the rates.\n4. Social Analysis\n121.  During  the  project  design,  500  project  beneficiary  households  were  surveyed  to\ndetermine  the  patterns  of  water  use,  the  attitudes  of  the  local  population  toward  water,\nwastewater, and sanitation cost; satisfaction with current water quality; willingness to pay; and\naffordability. About 79 percent of those surveyed stated that a clean environment was either\nimportant or very important to them. Half of the respondents identified improvement in water\nsupply as the highest priority, with 56-64 percent of this subgroup, in various districts, willing to\npay for improvements. The most requested improvement was for better water quality.\n122.  The survey data indicated that interviewees in the middle income bracket (earning Y500-\nY1,500/month) were willing to pay for clean water and wastewater services. Based on income\ndata collected and assuming that people spend Y10/month on water, at present people spend 1\npercent of their income on water. Health data collected and analyzed indicates that benefits that\ncan be derived from improvements in drainage and sanitation throughout the project areas and\nin reducing the risk to the safety of the public water supply.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n1. Financial Analysis\n123.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2000\nprices. Financial internal rate of return (FIRR) analysis was undertaken for each component.", "29\nThe FIRRs, 10.7 percent for the WWT component and 14.5 percent for the WRP component,\ncompare favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 4.9 percent for the WWT\ncomponent and 4.4 percent for the WRP component. Component FIRRs are high since current\ntariffs are low and the components are only part of current operations. Tariff increases are\nrequired to ensure the financial sustainability of the companies. A sensitivity analysis is given in\nTable 4 and the financial evaluation is shown in Appendix 11.\nTable 4: Sensitivity Analysis\nWastewater Treatment Water Resources Protection\nScenario\nWACC FIRR Minimum WACC FIRR Minimum\n(percent) (percent) DSCR (percent) (percent) DSCR\nBase Case 4.9 10.7 9.4 4.4 14.5 1.8\nCosts increase by 10 percent 8.7 13.2\nRevenues decrease by 10 percent 8.5 13.0\nOne-year delay in revenues 7.5 12.6\nExchange rate devaluation by 30 percent 8.5 12.7\nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio; FIRR = financial internal rate of return; WACC= weighted average cost of capital\n2. Economic Analysis\n124.  The economic analysis was conducted over a 25-year period inclusive of the project\nconstruction period, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.\nEconomic benefits and costs were denominated in terms of the domestic price numeraire and\nexpressed in constant 2000 prices. Project benefits and costs were estimated on a without and\nwith-project  basis  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  being  tradable  or  nontradable.  Tradable\ncomponents were adjusted to economic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11,\nand nontraded components were valued at domestic market prices. A shadow wage rate factor\nof 0.8 was applied to the unskilled labor costs. For the WWT component, benefits were valued\non the basis of incremental financial tariffs and net additional agricultural output. For the WRP\ncomponent, benefits were valued on the basis of resource cost savings and net additional\nagricultural output. The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.2 percent for the\nWWT component, 14.7 percent for the WRP component, and 14.8 percent overall. For both\ncomponents, the EIRR is expected to understate the full economic benefits since all indirect\neconomic growth and risk aversion benefits are not encapsulated in the calculation. A sensitivity\nanalysis  (Appendix  12)  indicates  that  both  components  remain  economically  viable  under\nadverse benefit and cost assumption testing.\n3. Fiscal Impact\n125.  The financial sustainability of the Project was verified through the financial analysis of\nTSC and TML, and through a review of the urban water demand. The financial projections for\nTSC and TML indicate that the Project will achieve the minimum debt service coverage ratios\nand acceptable rates of return on equity. Financial affordability analysis based on the proposed\ncombined retail water supply and wastewater tariff was undertaken and show estimated monthly\nbills would be around 2 percent of average household income and around 5 percent of the\nincome of households considered to be poor. To ensure that the Project does not have an\nadverse fiscal impact on either TML or the Tianjin Water Supply Company, wholesale and retail\ntariffs were structured on the basis of achieving full cost recovery. The annual return on equity\nfrom the Project is about 6 percent in real terms.", "30\nB. Environment\n126.  The Project will have substantial positive environmental benefits by improving water\nquality  and  the  living  environment  (paras.  108  and  114).  Adverse  project  impacts  on  the\nenvironment will be minimal and will be mitigated. A comprehensive monitoring program for the\npreconstruction,  construction,  and  operation  phases  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  all\nmitigation requirements are met. The Project also addresses the problem that farmland close to\nthe Zhou River is periodically flooded with contaminated water that cannot be released into the\nriver system. Approximately 40,000 ha of land is affected, although waterlogged land is still\nfarmed. With the Project, this land will be brought back into agricultural production by eliminating\nthe flooding problem.\nC. Social Dimensions\n127.  The Project will improve the living environment of the residents in areas it will serve\n(paras. 108 and 114), the Hai River Basin, and the lower reaches of the Yongdingxin River,\nenabling the expansion of the irrigated area at the same time.\n128.  Women play an important role as income earners and are well represented in the\nworkforce in Tianjin. Most women are involved in the cash economy in some way. Many provide\nadditional household income through either wage labor or small-scale trading and businesses\nsuch as restaurants or laundry shops. Women work at home as much as outside the home and\nare responsible for household duties and looking after children, the elderly, and the sick. A\nnumber of project impacts will directly benefit women. First, with the improved water supply and\navailability, women will require less time and resources in managing day-to-day domestic duties.\nSecond, improved water quality will reduce the incidence of water-related illnesses, potentially\nsaving time and money spent on medical care. Hygiene standards and health will improve as a\nresult of the Project. Other measures included will also ensure that women benefit from the\nProject, such as equal employment opportunities in TSC and TML, and during construction of\nfacilities.\nD. Poverty Impact\n129.  Historically, poverty has been concentrated in rural areas in the PRC. However, in the\n1990s, urban poverty began to emerge. Rapid rural-urban migration, the floating populations\nand the laying off of redundant workers has contributed to rapidly growing urban poverty. Urban\npoverty is now a major concern of the Government. There is little consolidated information\navailable on urban poverty in the PRC. ADB has provided TA41 to help fill this gap. Tianjin is one\nof the cities that might be included in an urban poverty study financed by ADB.\n130.  The Tianjin urban area has a per capita average urban annual income of Y7,110, higher\nthan the national average. If the international standard of $1/day is used to define rural poverty,\nand $3/day to define urban poverty in east coast cities, both adjusted for purchasing power\nparities,42  about  5  percent  of  Tianjin's  urban  population,  or  210,000  of  the  Project\u2019s\nbeneficiaries, live in poverty. The Project will help reduce poverty by (i) preventing increases in\nthe incidence of waterborne diseases, which will reduce spending on medical care and sick\ndays taken, thus providing more income to households; (ii) safeguarding the quality of drinking\nwater  and  improvements  in  wastewater  services  (poverty  goes  beyond  income  levels  and\nincludes deprivation of essential assets and opportunities to which every human is entitled); and\n                                                \n41\n TA 3377-PRC: Urban Poverty Study, for $410,000, approved on 22 December 1999.\n42\nUsing this methodology, the rural and urban poverty lines for Tianjin would be Y962 and Y2,286, respectively.", "31\n(iii) providing equal opportunity to women, as women are typically more at risk of falling into\npoverty than men.\nE. Risks\n131.  Potential financial and policy risks related to the Project include failure (i) of TMG to\nmeet  the  cash/equity  transfers  required  to  construct  the  Project;  (ii)  of  TMG  to  generate\nadequate political support to increase water tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; (iii) of TMG to\neffectively enforce its discharge monitoring program; (iv) of upstream pollution management\nunder the HRPPCP for the water resources component; (v) of TMG to construct sufficient sewer\nconnections  for  the  WWT  component;  and  (vi)  to  implement,  in  parallel  with  project\nimplementation, the dam safety program for the WRP component.\n132.  The potential financial and policy risks have been mitigated by assurances related to the\nfinancial and managerial autonomy for TSC and TML. ADB review missions will monitor TSC\nand TML compliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure their financial\nsustainability. With a commitment letter provided by the Tianjin Finance Bureau ensuring the\nlocal equity contribution for the two components, local funding is not expected to be a constraint.\nThe  companies\u2019  assurance  to  (i)  establish  an  account  to  cover  four  months  of  operating\nexpenditures; and (ii) set up a debt service account with sufficient funds to cover four months of\ndebt service payments under the ADB loan are also measures to mitigate financial risks. The\nProject does not have any unusual technical risks. The raw water and transmission mains and\nWWT plant included in the Project will use standard technology common throughout the PRC\nthat conforms to international standards. Specific construction risks will be mitigated by the use\nof experienced domestic and international consultants to prepare detailed designs and monitor\nimplementation.  The  risk  of  delay  in  construction  has  been  addressed  through  ongoing\nsynchronization efforts and TMG\u2019s confirmation of the appointment of the deputy mayor as chair\nof the Project. Upstream pollution management of the WRP component will be addressed under\nthe Hai River Basin Management Plan. TMG has agreed to commit to the dam safety program\nand related enhancements.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n133.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following\nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents:\n1. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n134.  Compliance with Laws and Regulations.  TMG will ensure that all land and rights of\nway required for the Project are made available in timely manner. TMG and each PIA will\nensure that the provisions of the RP agreed with ADB, including compensation and other\nentitlements for affected persons (APs), are in accordance with all applicable government laws\nand regulations and ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. Within three months after loan\neffectiveness, the RP will be amplified to reflect details of preliminary technical design and will\ninclude a livelihood restoration program satisfactory to ADB.\n135.  Implementation.  TMG and each PIA will ensure that (i) all necessary measures have\nbeen taken to ensure timely implementation of the RP, including public consultations with APs;\nand (ii) every AP is fully compensated and assisted prior to displacement from housing, land,\nlivelihood sources, and/or assets, in accordance with the RP so that such APs are at least as\nwell off as they would have been in the absence of the Project.", "32\n136.  Budget.  TMG and each PIA will ensure timely provision of counterpart funds for land\nacquisition and resettlement activities specified under the RP. TMG and each PIA will ensure\nthat counterpart funds for compensation entitlements under the RP are fully provided directly to\nAPs and the relevant village organizations.\n137.  Monitoring and Reporting.  TMG and each PIA will ensure that (i) adequate staff and\nresources are committed for internal monitoring of the implementation of the RP and appropriate\nmeasures, including internal monitoring reviews, will be undertaken during RP implementation;\n(ii) an independent domestic monitoring agency will be selected in accordance with procedures\nacceptable to the ADB to carry out monitoring, evaluation, and bi-annual reviews during RP\nimplementation; and (iii) a resettlement monitoring and evaluation system and a methodology\nfor socioeconomic assessments of the impacts of resettlement under the Project, acceptable to\nADB, will be established.\n138.  Each PIA will coordinate with and oversee authorities involved in resettlement activities\nunder the Project, to ensure effective RP implementation, and will provide periodic reports to\nADB on the progress of land acquisition and resettlement.\n2. Environment\n139.  General.  TMG and the PIAs will ensure that the project facilities are constructed,\noperated, maintained, and monitored in strict conformity with (i) all applicable government laws\nand  regulations,  including  national  and  local  environmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and\noccupational safety regulations and standards; (ii) the environmental mitigation and monitoring\nmeasures detailed in the EIA and summary EIA for the Project approved by SEPA; and (iii)\napplicable ADB requirements.\n140.  Monitoring.  Each PIA will ensure, among others, that its respective environmental\nmonitoring  offices  will  include  an  adequate  number  of  full-time  personnel,  and  sufficient\nresources  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring  program,  under\nguidance of TEPB through TEMC and that annual environmental reports will be submitted to\nADB until commencement of commercial operation of the project facilities.\n141.  Water  Resources  Safety  and  Protection.  TMG  and  TML  will  ensure  that  (i)  the\ndetailed design of Part B of the Project adequately addresses Yuqiao Reservoir safety concerns\nand incorporates a program for completion of pressurized grouting of the Reservoir Dam,\nincluding regular monitoring; (ii) sufficient funds are made available for timely completion of the\npressurized grouting program of the Reservoir Dam; (iii) a comprehensive study and evaluation\nof the modification of fish ponds within the relevant protective dike at the inlet of the Yuqiao\nReservoir will be submitted to ADB for review before any biological treatment basin or other\nenvironmental improvement activities are started that could affect the fish ponds remaining\naround the Yuqiao Reservoir.\n142.  Wastewater Treatment Plant and Related. TMG and TSC will ensure that (i) the\ndetailed design of the Beicang WWT plant adequately addresses potential irrigation reuse\nissues; (ii) prior Beicang WWT plant operations start, (a) construction of pipes necessary for raw\nsewage collection will have been completed; and (b) a landfill facility within the Xianyang Road\nWWT plant will be operating; (iii) remedial measures are undertaken to minimize odor from the\nBeicang WWT plant, including source control; and (iv) internationally acceptable practices are\nused during construction of the Beicang WWT plant and related project facilities to minimize\nnegative environmental impacts, including measures for dust reduction, provision of storm runoff\ndetention ponds, and controlled disposal of waste soil and, wherever possible, use of trenchless\nmethods for necessary pipe-laying.", "33\n143.  TMG  will  ensure  the  timely  implementation  of  the  industrial  pollution  sources\nmanagement program requiring industries to improve pretreatment of wastewater to satisfy\nnational wastewater discharge standards.\n3. Counterpart Funding\n144.  The  Government,  through  TMG,  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  local  and  foreign  currency\ncounterpart  financing  necessary  for  the  Project,  including  equity  contributions  and  cash\nadvances, is provided in time to enable completion of project activities; and (ii) additional\ncounterpart funding will be provided for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns.\n4. Performance Framework Contracts\n145.  The PIAs will implement in a timely manner their performance framework contracts,\nparticularly with regard to agreed strategic business and action plans relating to improvements\nin institutional, managerial, operational, personnel, financial, and technological systems, and\nmarketing and customer relations.\n5. Cost Recovery\n146.  TMG, TML, and TSC will review the tariff regimes, including for water and wastewater,\nprior to the midterm review of project implementation. The review will include (i) recalculation of\nminimum cost recovery tariffs based on actual project costs, the proposed capital investment\nprogram,  and  ongoing  Government  requirements;  (ii)  affordability  and  willingness-to-pay\nsurveys; (iii) financial and economic benefits analysis; and (iv) extension of the price escalation\nmechanism to household and commercial users and other potential fees, charges, or market-\nbased instruments to encourage water conservation and sound environmental behavior. The\nfindings will be submitted to ADB for review and discussion during the midterm review of project\nimplementation.\n147.  TMG will ensure that by the end of 2005 the wastewater tariffs charged by TSC to all\nwastewater consumers are increased from the present levels to ensure full recovery of O&M,\ndepreciation, and financial costs, i.e., debt service obligations, and a reasonable profit margin\nfor TSC. Thus, TSC will prepare and submit the necessary applications for tariff increases to\nGovernment authorities concerned.\n148.  TMG will ensure that by the end of 2005 the raw water tariffs charged to its consumers\nare increased to ensure full recovery of O&M, depreciation, and financial costs, i.e. debt service\nobligations, and a reasonable profit margin for TML. Thus, TML will prepare and submit the\nnecessary applications for tariff increases to Government authorities concerned.\n149.  TMG will ensure that no entity will be exempted from the tariff established, granted a\npreferential rate, or excused for delays in payments without penalties.\n6. Training\n150.  The PIAs will prepare and submit their training plans to be implemented under the\nProject to ADB for review and concurrence, and will ensure that training institutes for such\npurpose will be selected in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\n7. Implementation arrangements\n151.  TMG will ensure that TSC and TML will have full financial, operational, and managerial\nautonomy, including with respect to staffing decisions and determination of annual business\nplans and financial and capital expenditure budgets.", "34\n152.  TSC and TML will appoint commercial auditors that are qualified to undertake company\naudits in the PRC and are acceptable to ADB and an audit committee of each board of directors\nwill be established to review internal and external audit reports and to consider other issues of\ncorporate governance.\n8. Financial Performance\n153.  TSC and TML companies will maintain (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.4:1,\n(ii) maximum debt equity ratio of 65:35, and (iii) minimum current ratio of 2:1.\n9. Financial Matters\n154.  TSC and TML will each establish separate bank accounts and ensure that each account\nmaintains  a  minimum  balance  to  cover  one  month  of  estimated  O&M  expenditure  and,\nbeginning no later than 1 January 2004, a minimum balance sufficient to cover four months of\nestimated O&M expenditures for its operations.\n155.  TSC and TML will each establish an account by 1 March 2005 or within 60 days of\nincurring any long-term debt obligations and will ensure that the minimum balances in such an\naccount will be sufficient to cover four months of debt service obligations.\n156.  TSC  and  TML,  among  others,  will  ensure  that  interest  and  principal  payments  on\nshareholders  advances,  if  any,  will  be  made  from  general  cash  reserves,  excluding  cash\nmaintained in the retention account and debt service accounts.\nB. Condition to Loan Effectiveness\n157.  As a condition to loan effectiveness, the Government agrees that onlending agreements,\nin form and substance satisfactory to ADB, will have been entered into between (a) TMG and\nTSC, for Part A of the Project; and (b) TMG and TML, for Part B of the Project.\nC.  Condition of Disbursement\n158.  No  disbursements  of  the  ADB  loan  for  financing  the  Water  Resources  Protection\ncomponent of the Project will be made until TML and China Development Bank have entered\ninto a cofinancing agreement for such purpose on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n159.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $130,000,000 to the People's Republic\nof China for the Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water Resources Protection Project from\nADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's pool-\nbased variable lending rate system for US dollar loans and with a term of 25 years, including a\ngrace period of 5 years, and other such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance\nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n16 November 2000", "35\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Project Logical Framework 36 1,3\n2 Affordability Analysis 41 10, 43\n3 Cost Estimates 43 19, 80\n4 Flow of Funds Chart 44 19, 82\n5 Financial Performance and Projections 45 21, 88\n6 Project Organization Chart 49 22, 91\n7 Implementation Schedule 50 22, 93\n8 Outline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services 51 23, 95\n9 Indicative Procurement Packages 54 23, 96\n10 Summary Resettlement Plan 55 27, 118\n11 Financial Evaluation 59 29, 123\n12 Economic Analysis 65 29, 124\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA ADB\u2019s Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Urban, Environment, and\nWater Supply Sectors\nB Summary Environmental Impact Assessment\nC Public Participation Activities\nD Detailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\nE Draft Performance Contracts\nF Resettlement Plan\nG Land Impacts and Land Allocation Before and After the Project\nH Detailed Economic Analysis\nI Details of Financial Projections / Historical Statements", "36 Appendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT LOGICAL FRAMEWORK\nProject Monitoring\nDesign Summary Indicators & Targets Risks/ Assumptions\nMechanisms\nA.

Affordability analysis was undertaken for the year 2005, comparing a range of household\nincomes with estimated retail water bills. The analysis was undertaken at current 2005 prices.\n2. Estimated  retail  bills  include  raw  water,  wastewater,  and  an  incremental  tap  water\ncharge. Estimates assume: (i) no change in current household size, (ii) an increase in water\nconsumption per capita from 107 to 117 liters per day, (iii) implementation of recommended\ntariff increases for wastewater and raw water; and (iv) no real increase in the incremental\ncharge made by the water distribution companies. Detailed assumptions are shown in Table A2.\n3. The total combined retail charge is estimated to be Y2.61/m3 (2000 prices) equivalent to\nY2.96/m3  (2005  prices).    Based  on  estimated  average  water  consumption  per  capita  and\nhousehold size, the average monthly retail water bill in 2005 is estimated to be Y28 (2000\nprices), equivalent to Y32 (2005 prices).  This represents a doubling of the current average\nhousehold bill in real terms.\n4. For the analysis, household incomes are assumed to remain constant over the period.\nThis is a conservative estimate given recent growth of around 4 percent per annum. However,\nby assuming static real incomes, the analysis allows for differential income growth across\nhousehold income categories and helps to ensure that the affordability assessment is realistic\nfor the very low income categories.\n5. For the mean income household, the monthly combined water bill is Y32, around 1.5\npercent of income.  For the poorest 5 percent of households, the monthly combined water bill is\nY35, around 4.5 percent of income.\n6. Charges are considered to be affordable for all income levels. Even for the poorest 5\npercent  of  households,  bills  represent  less  than  5  percent  of  monthly  income,  within  the\naccepted affordability range.", "Table A2.

Overview and Basis of Estimation Used\n1.  Tianjin Sewage Company (TSC) is responsible for wastewater collection, treatment, and\ndisposal and stormwater drainage for six service areas within urban Tianjin. TSC was registered\nas a state-owned enterprise in May 1996, through a transfer of assets and staffing from the\nformer Sewerage Management department of the Tianjin Engineering Management Bureau.   \n2.  Tianjin Luanhe Drinking Water Source Protection Engineering Ltd (TML) is responsible\nfor the supply of raw water for urban Tianjin and for flood control services.  TML was registered,\nas a state-owned enterprise in January 2000, through the transfer of assets and staffing from\nthe Luan River Diversion Management Bureau (LRDMB).\n3.  TSC  and  TML  operate  and  maintain  existing  assets  required  for  the  provision  of\nwastewater and raw water supply services. Financial projections for TSC and TML are based on\nfull cost recovery for all operations of the company including existing operations, additional\nfacilities provided under the Project, and known investment plans.   \n4.  Financial projections are undertaken in current prices. International inflation is assumed\nto be 2.4 percent per annum. Domestic inflation is assumed to be 1.8 percent for 2000, 2.0\npercent for 2001, and 3.0 percent thereafter.\nB. Wastewater Treatment Component\n1. Operating Costs\n5.  Current annual operating costs of TSC are Y138 million ($16.7 million) including two\nexisting wastewater treatment plants, facilities, equipment, and the sewer network. Additional\noperating costs incurred by the Project are estimated by TSC at Y25 million ($3.0 million)\nannual, including labor, power, maintenance, chemicals, inspection fees and other costs to\ncover the new wastewater treatment plant, and the additional network and pumping stations.\nAdditional operating costs of Y96 million ($11.6 million) will be incurred in 2004, to cover\nadditional facilities not covered under the Project, including one new treatment plant (Xing Yang\nRoad due for completion in 2003), expansion of the existing treatment plant at Jizhuangxi (due\nfor completion in 2003), and associated sewer networks. Operating costs are assumed to\nincrease in line with inflation.\n2. Capital Expenditure\n6.  Project capital expenditure is estimated at Y343 million ($41.4 million). This includes\nphysical contingencies of 10 percent for all items, and price contingencies in line with expected\ninflation. Replacement costs for mechanical equipment are included in 2014.\n 3. Revenues\n7.  Revenues will come from direct user charges and subsidies.  Proposed direct charges\nfor all user types are Y1.06 ($0.13) by 2005 (2000 prices) equivalent to Y1.2 ($0.15) by 2005,\n(2005 prices). For industries where wastewater is monitored, TSC will collect revenues. For all\nother industries, domestic and other use, revenues will be collected by the water distribution\ncompany, which will charge 2 percent commission. Charges will be based on 100 percent of\nwater supplied and no industry or activity will be exempt from charges. Annual wastewater\nvolumes, at 417 million m3, are expected to rise at an average of 2 percent per annum.", "46 Appendix 5, page 2\n8.  The storm water subsidy of Y34 million ($4.1 million) will continue as a storm water\ndrainage charge to TMG, reflecting the \u201cpublic good\u201d that the service provides. The charge will\nremain constant in real terms.  The sewerage subsidy of Y5 million ($0.6 million) will cease in\n2000. The sewage treatment subsidy will be phased out. The subsidy is assumed to halve in\n2000 and cease in 2003, allowing tariffs to increase at a politically acceptable rate, which is\nnecessary for successful project implementation.\n4. Balance Sheet Assumptions\n9.  The opening balance is based on TSC balance sheet for 1998. Total current assets are\nY103 million ($12.4 million). Gross fixed assets are Y1,361 million ($164.4 million), accumulated\ndepreciation Y50 million ($6.0 million), and net fixed assets in operation Y1,311 million ($158.3\nmillion).\n10.  Opening balance of the capital account was assumed to be the same as the value of net\nfixed assets in operation.\n11.  Project fixed assets are depreciated at 4 percent per annum on a declining balance.\nExisting assets are depreciated at a composite index of 3.1 percent per annum, on the basis of\na detailed analysis of specific items in the asset register. Assets to be transferred to the TSC in\nthe future are depreciated at 2.5 percent per annum.\n12.  Accounts receivable represent 15 percent of current period debit.\n13.  Accounts  payable  represent  10  percent  of  operating  expenses.  Seventy  percent  of\nadditions to accounts payable are paid in the following year.\n14.  The allowance for doubtful debts represents 5 percent of current period debit.\n15.  Long term debt includes the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan, of Y217 million ($26.2\nmillion) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital reserves, which carries an interest rate of 6.42 percent per\nannum, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a 1 percent front end fee. The loan is repaid\nover 25 years with a grace period of 5 years.\n16.  Provision for foreign exchange and interest risk is included as part of debt service at an\nadditional 5 percentage points over the prevailing interest rate of 6.42 percent.\n17.  Nonoperational revenue is based on the 1999 TSC profit and loss statement, at Y10\nmillion ($1.2 million) representing profits on construction. It is assumed to remain constant in\nreal terms.\n18.  Interest on cash balance is 4 percent per annum.\n19.  TSC will be exempt from business income tax until 2005. From 2006, income tax is\nassumed at 33 percent of net revenue.\n20.  TSC will review financial performance on a yearly basis and assess appropriate tariff\nlevels to achieve full cost recovery, considering items including revenue collection performance,\nactual costs, and investment plans.\n5. Projected Financial Statements\n21.  Detailed  financial  projections  up  to  the  year  2015  have  been  prepared  for  TSC.\nProjections  cover  the  wastewater  management  operations  as  proposed  under  the  Project,\nexisting operations, and the new facilities under construction. The projected financial statements\nare presented in current prices that include inflation in each year.", "47 Appendix 5, page 3\n22.  Total assets are seen to increase from Y1.4 billion ($0.17 billion) in 2000 to Y6.2 billion\n($0.75 billion) in 2015 as a result of growth in retained earnings from operations and the transfer\nof assets. Sufficient cash is generated to be able to pay all debt service requirements.\n23.  On the basis of the proposed charges, and subsidies in the first two years, TSC will run\nat a small profit over the projection period. Profits (measured by return on capital employed) in\nthe early years are low, rise to reach 8 percent in 2003, as tariff increases take place. Profit\nlevels fall to 2 percent in 2004. This is the result of the additional expenditure required to cover\nthe operations and maintenance of additional facilities from 2004. Profit levels slowly increase to\nreach 8 percent by 2015. These profit levels are considered to be reasonable, in conjunction\nwith PRC guidelines.1\nC. Water Resources Protection Component\n1. Operating Costs\n24.  Current operating costs of facilities and raw water delivery is estimated at Y218 million\n($26.3 million). This includes raw water purchase, operation and maintenance of reservoirs,\ntunnel, administration of the bureau and monitoring and covers all labor, power, equipment and\nother costs. Additional operating costs associated with the Project are Y25 million ($3.0 million).\n2. Capital Costs\n25.  Capital expenditure under the Project is estimated at Y2.2 billion ($0.27 billion). TML\ndoes  not  have  any  specific  long-term  investment  plans,  thus  no  specific  investments  or\nadditional costs are included in the financial projections.\n3. Revenues\n26.  Revenues  will  come  from  direct  charges.  Proposed  direct  charges  for  raw  water\nconsumed are Y0.75 ($0.09) by 2005 (2000 prices) equivalent to Y0.85 ($0.10)/cubic meter (m3)\nby 2005, (2005 prices), and Y0.25 ($0.03) by 2005 (2000 prices) equivalent to Y0.28 ($0.03)/m3\nby 2005 (2005 prices), for industries that recycle water. TML will collect charges from the water\ndistribution companies for consumed water and will charge users directly for recycled water.\nAnnual consumption of water is projected to rise from 537 million m3 in 2000 to 748 million m3\nby 2020, an average growth rate of about 1.7 percent per annum. Demand for recycled water\nused primarily by the power plants, steel works, and paper mill is expected to remain constant at\n415 million m3 per annum.\n27.  No  specific  subsidies  are  included  for  flood  control  services  provided  by  TML.  No\ninformation regarding the costs of flood control as an operation is available and it has not been\npossible to determine an appropriate charge for the activity. Rather, flood control is an integral\npart of raw water provision, and as such is a positive economic externality of the operation.\n4. Balance Sheet Assumptions\n28.  All assets of LRDMB are transferred to TML in the year 2000.\n29.  The opening balance, at the end of 1999, is based on asset valuations provided by\nLRDMB, adjusted for inflation and assuming 60 percent accumulated depreciation. Net fixed\nassets in operation are Y717 million ($86.6 million).\n30.  The opening balance of the capital account was assumed to be the same as the value of\nnet fixed assets in operation.\n                                                \n1 State Circular 1192, issued by SPDC, MOF, and SEPA in September 1999.", "48 Appendix 5, page 4\n31.  Project fixed assets and existing assets are depreciated at 2.5 percent per annum on a\ndeclining balance. The rate is low since the assets are primarily civil works with a long economic\nlife. The diversion management department assets are depreciated at 5 percent, since these\nassets include noncivil works items, including vehicles.   \n32.  Accounts receivable represent 15 percent of current period debit.\n33.  Accounts  payable  represent  10  percent  of  operating  expenses.  Seventy  percent  of\nadditions to accounts payable are paid in the following year.\n34.  The allowance for doubtful debts represents 5 percent of current period debit.\n35.  Long-term debt includes the ADB loan, of Y859 million ($103.7 million) from ADB\u2019s\nordinary capital reserves, and a loan from China Development Bank of Y727 million ($87.8\nmillion). The ADB loan carries an interest rate of 6.42 percent per annum, a commitment charge\nof 0.75 percent and a 1 percent front end fee. The loan is repaid over 25 years with a grace\nperiod of 5 years. The China Development Bank loan carries an interest rate of 6.21 percent per\nannum. The loan is repaid over 15 years, with a grace period of 5 years.\n36.  Provision for foreign exchange and interest risk is included as part of debt service at an\nadditional 5 percentage points over the prevailing interest rate of 6.42 percent.\n37.  Nonoperational income is 3 percent of operating revenues.\n38.  Interest on cash balance is 4 percent per annum.\n39.  TML will be exempt from business income tax until 2005. From 2006, income tax is\nassumed at 33 percent of net revenue.\n40.  TML will review financial performance on a yearly basis and assess appropriate tariff\nlevels to achieve full cost recovery, considering items including revenue collection performance,\nactual costs, and investment plans.\n5. Projected Financial Statements\n41.  Detailed  financial  projections  up  to  the  year  2015  have  been  prepared  for  TML.\nProjections cover existing raw water supply operations and additional facilities proposed under\nthe Project. The projected financial statements are presented in current prices that include\ninflation in each year.\n42.  Total assets are seen to increase from Y0.8 billion ($0.10 billion) in 2000 to Y4.8 billion\n($0.58  billion)  in  2015.  Sufficient  cash  is  generated  to  be  able  to  pay  all  debt  service\nrequirements.\n43.  On the basis of the proposed charges, TML will run at a small profit over the projection\nperiod. Profits increase gradually over the period. In the years of implementation and up to\n2010, average profit levels measured by return on capital employed are less than 6 percent, in\nline with People\u2019s Republic of China guidelines.2 After this period, profits rise gradually.\n                                                \n2 Reasonable profit for raw water provision is designated to 4-6 percent.

Introduction\n1.  This summary resettlement plan (RP) draws upon the comprehensive resettlement plan\nprepared  for  the  Project,  which  involves  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  effects.  It  also\nincorporates  the  discussion  on  resettlement  with  the  relevant  agencies  carried  out  during\nappraisal. The RP was prepared on the basis of the feasibility designs. As a condition for loan\neffectiveness, the RP will be revised and updated when the preliminary technical design is\nfinalized. The revised RP will be submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) prior to land\nclearing, and will include livelihood restoration plans. A detailed socioeconomic survey has been\ncompleted.\n2.  The Tianjin Municipal Development Planning Commission, in collaboration with Tianjin\nSewerage Company, the Tianjin Luanhe Drinking Water Source Protection Engineering Ltd,\nother relevant agencies, and the project preparatory technical assistance consultants, was\nresponsible for preparing the RP, and ensuring that the requirements of the Asian Development\nBank  (policy  on  involuntary  resettlement, Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good\nPractice) are met.\nB. Land Acquisition, Land Use, and Resettlement\n3.  Project impacts have been identified by a preliminary survey that was undertaken during\nOctober 1999 to January 2000.  Thus, resettlement impacts and budget are estimates and will\nbe revised in light of the preliminary technical design. As a result of permanent land acquisition\nof 4.29 million square meters (m2), over 3,360 people or 940 households will be affected in 125\nvillages and one district (45 around the reservoir and 80 for the upgrade of the upgrade of the\nchannel  and  the  Zhou  River  diversion  channel,  and  Beichang  District).  Temporary  land\nacquisition of 5.51 million m2 will affect over 6,370 persons or 1,591 households. Physical\nrelocation  of  12  households,  with  56  affected  persons  (APs)  is  expected.  No  community\nstructures or public institutions will be affected by the Project.\n4.  Table A10.1 gives details of land impacts resulting from the project.\nTable A10.1: Land Impacts\n(\u2018000 m2)\nPermanent Land Temporary Land\nProject Structure/Component Total\nImpact Impact\nA.

Project Impacts on Livelihood\n5.  In most affected villages, APs engage in agricultural activities.  Economic activities are\ngenerally restricted by environmental regulations. Some villages have lost most of their land\nalready to the reservoir, and are provided with a subsidy for food and fuel. Incomes are\nsupplemented by other occupations, such as service-related activities and transportation, and\nindustrial enterprises. Several villages subsist mainly on fishing in the reservoir. Due to the\nrelatively  small  parcels  of  land  being  acquired  in  each  village,  most  households  will  not\nexperience a major impact from land acquisition. Land impacts (permanent and temporary) and\nland allocation per capita before and after the Project are given as a supplementary appendix. A\nlivelihood restoration program will review options and develop viable employment activities that\nare permitted by environmental regulations, particularly in villages that have low land per capita\nratios. The options will include\n(i)  land development;\n(ii)  agricultural intensification;\n(iii)  enterprise development; and\n(iv)  self-employment by APs, with provision for start-up capital.\nD. Compensation and Entitlements\n6.  The compensation fees and entitlements are based on laws and regulations of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the ADB guidelines and policies relating to resettlement. The\nwastewater treatment component is governed by the 1998 Land Administration Law. The water\nresource component is governed by the 1991 Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) Regulations\non  Medium  and  Large  Hydropower  Project  Construction.  Since  MWR  is  revising  these\nregulations, any changes will be incorporated, as necessary, in the revised RP. All APs, legal\nand illegal land users, will be eligible for compensation. Compensation for nonland assets will\nbe made at full replacement rates.\nE. Public Information, Consultation, Grievance, and Appeal\n7.  During the impact survey and planning of resettlement, consultations were undertaken\nwith town and township leaders. Interviews and informal discussions have been held in the\naffected  towns  and  villages.  The  revised  RP  will  include  plans  for  livelihood  restoration,\ndeveloped in close consultation with APs, and fully disclosed to them. The revised RP will be\nfully translated into Chinese and provided to APs at least two months before ground leveling\nand construction commence. The project implementation agencies (PIAs) will address any\nconcerns  raised  by  APs.  Consultation  sessions  will  be  held  with  APs  to  fully  explain\nresettlement entitlements, including the compensation rates. The final RP will be available at the\noffice of the village committee in all project-affected areas, and the revised RP will take into\nconsideration all comments received. The PIAs placed the SRP in the affected township offices\nfor review by the APs prior to loan negotiations. A comments register, both verbal and written,\nwill be kept by township resettlement offices. The RP consultation plan is shown in Table A10.2.\nGrievances may be expressed verbally to the local village committee or more formally by letter\nto higher authorities at county and municipal level land management bureau. APs if dissatisfied\nwith the administrative resolution of their dispute may also appeal to the people\u2019s court. A full\ndescription of the grievance procedure and timescales involved are contained in the RP.", "Table A10.2: Public Participation Plan\nForm of Implementing Target\nPurpose of Event Timing Remarks\nEvent Agencies Participants\nInformation briefing on the Display of 15 June County All project (cid:1)  meetings to be held in each county\nproject and resettlement issues resettlement July 2000 resettlement office, APs\nto elicit comments on project plan (RP) at village committee\nfrom affected persons (APs). township\nlevel\nDisplay summary RP on website Global 15 June 2000 Asian Development Global\nBank\nInform project beneficiaries of Community During Project APs (cid:1)  AP input into livelihood activities\nproject progress, final design, meetings preliminary implementation (cid:1)  Identify training requirements for Aps\nand project timing, consult with and focus technical agencies, county\nAPs on livelihood activities for group design and resettlement office,\ninclusion in the revised RP. discussions prior to loan and village\neffectiveness committee\n(Oct-Nov\n2000)\nPresent and elicit comments on Community Jan 2001 Village committee All project (cid:1)  Distribution of the draft RP before event\nthe revised RP meetings APs (cid:1)  Discuss concerns relating to RP\nand focus (cid:1)  Identify \u201cgaps\u201d in RP 5\ngroup (cid:1)  Undertake focus group discussions with 7\ndiscussions various occupations, age groups, and\nwomen to elicit specific concerns\nFinal inventory and census Individual Dec 2000- County All project (cid:1)  Inventory all assets and land holdings\ninterviews, Jan 2001 resettlement office, APs (cid:1)  Collect additional socioeconomic data\nhousehold village committee\ninterviews\nAdvise APs of entitlements and Public Jan-Feb 2001 County All project (cid:1)  Household meetings to outline\ndisbursement of compensation meetings resettlement office, APs entitlements\nvillage committee\nMonitoring of APs, project Household June 2001- County Random (cid:1)  Identify where additional support is\nbeneficiaries, and health meetings June 2005 resettlement office, sample required particularly for vulnerable and\nimpacts. village committee, disadvantaged groups\nand independent (cid:1)  Provide recommendations and update A\np\nexternal monitor RP monitoring plan p\n(cid:1)  Identify health improvements e\nn\n(cid:1)  Assess project beneficiaries\u2019 ability to d\npay tariff and satisfaction with water and ix \n1\nwastewater service. 0\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n3", "58 Appendix 10, page 4\nF. Organization, Implementation, and Monitoring and Evaluation\n8.  The PIAs and the county resettlement office will be responsible for implementing the RP.\nImplementation at the local level is the responsibility of county and township governments and\nvillage committees of the affected areas. Implementation of the RP will be monitored by the\nPIAs.  The  PIAs  will  brief  all  resettlement  staff  fully  on  the  contents  of  the  RP  prior  to\nimplementation. During RP implementation, internal monitoring will be undertaken every six\nweeks. Post resettlement monitoring will be undertaken internally by the PIAs every three\nmonths. External monitoring will be undertaken annually for two years after resettlement and will\ninclude a socioeconomic survey of at least 15 percent of affected families in villages affected by\nland acquisition and those affected by house relocation.  Data will be disaggregated by gender,\nand attention will be given to vulnerable groups. The aim is to ascertain whether the Project has\nmet the resettlement objectives of providing equal or better livelihoods and living standards. An\ninternational  specialist  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  engaged  to  help  develop  a\nresettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  a  methodology  for  the  socioeconomic\nassessments.  The  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  pay  particular  attention  to\nlivelihood restoration. At the end of each monitoring exercise, a report will be submitted to the\nPIAs, who will forward a copy to ADB.\nG. Cost Estimates and Flow of Resettlement Funds\n9.  The cost of land acquisition and resettlement, including monitoring and evaluation, is\npart of the project cost and has been included in the project cost estimates. The PIA will be\nresponsible for arranging the resettlement financing and for negotiating with the APs. Tianjin\nMunicipal Government will guarantee to meet any budget shortfall required to meet the RP\nobjectives, including any changes approved to the 1991 MWR Regulations on Medium and\nLarge Hydropower Project Construction. PIA will ensure the compensation and other specified\nassistance  is  provided  in  full,  on  time,  and  directly  to  the  APs  and  their  collectives.  The\nresettlement  funds  will  be  will  be  provided  to  village  committees,  enterprises  offering  job\nopportunities, the APs to be resettled, and other agencies involved in resettlement management\nand administration. Entitlements will be provided to the APs before demolition and ground\nleveling commence.", "59 Appendix 11, page 1\nFINANCIAL EVALUATION\nA. Introduction\n1.  Financial viability was assessed for each of the project components by comparing (i) the\nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR), based on incremental revenue generation, with the\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC); and (ii) the average incremental financial revenue\n(AIFR) with the average incremental financial cost (AIFC).  A series of sensitivity tests were also\nundertaken.  All figures shown are in constant 2000 prices, unless otherwise stated.\n2.  Cost  recovery  is  based  on  tariffs  required  for  financial  sustainability  of  the  project\nagencies,  Tianjin  Sewerage  Company  (TSC)  and  Tianjin  Luanhe  Drinking  Water  Source\nProtection Engineering Ltd (TML).\n3.  Affordability analysis was undertaken for combined wastewater and water tariffs, by\ncomparing monthly bills with household income levels, including the 5 percent of residents\nestimated to be poor.\nB. Wastewater Treatment Component\n1. Costs\n4.  Costs include capital expenditures related to the Project in the year they are incurred,\nincluding  physical  contingencies  but  excluding  price  contingencies.  Operations  and\nmaintenance costs include labor, equipment, power, and other costs, based on estimates from\nTSC.  Replacement costs for mechanical and electrical equipment are included every 10 years.\nAll components are assumed to have a life of 20 years except for civil works, which are\nassumed to have a life of 40 years.\n2. Incremental Revenue\n5.  Incremental revenues were calculated for the Project, using proposed incremental tariff\nincreases in constant 2000 prices and wastewater flow projections for the Beicang service area.\nSince  the  capacity  of  the  treatment  plant  is  100,000m3/day,  this  volume  is  taken  as  the\nmaximum for incremental revenue calculations. It is assumed that revenues will be realized in\nline with the proposed schedule for introducing charges.\n3. Financial Viability\n6.  The WACC is calculated at 4.9 percent, discounting at international inflation rates for the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) loan portion, and assuming a 6 percent real return on equity for\nTianjin Municipal Government (TMG). The FIRR is calculated at 10.7 percent, based on a 5\nyear implementation period and a 20 year operating period.\n7.  Table A11.1 summarizes the results of the analysis and sensitivity tests.  The base-case\nFIRR  exceeds  the  WACC  by  around  5  percentage  points,  indicating  that  the  Project  is\nfinancially viable.  This margin is necessary, since tariff revenues are also required to pay for\nother operations of TSC. Sensitivity tests show that the Project remains viable under adverse\ncost, revenue and exchange rate assumptions.", "60 Appendix 11, page 2\nTable A11.1: Wastewater Treatment Component, Summary Results of FIRR Analysis\nSensitivity\nFIRR\nIndicator\nBase Case 10.7\n8.7\nCosts Increase by 10% 1.8\n8.5 2.0\nRevenues Reduce by 10%\n6.6\nCosts Increase by 10% and  Revenues Reduce by 10%\n7.5\nExchange Rate Devaluation of 30 %\n8.5\nRevenues delayed by one year\nNote: The sensitivity indicator measures the proportionate decrease in the FIRR as costs increase or revenues\ndecrease.\n8.  AIFC and AIFR were calculated by discounting annual capital investment and operation\ncosts, and incremental revenues, at the WACC. The AIFR of 1.27 exceeds the AIFC of 0.72.\nThis indicates that the Project will realize positive returns.  Since the FIRR exceeds the WACC,\nand the AIFR exceeds the AIFC, the Project is demonstrated to be financially viable.\n5. Cost Recovery\n9.  Tariff estimates are based on (i) full cost recovery; (ii) financial sustainability of TSC,\nincluding non-Project operations; (iii) two tariff increases, the first in 2003 and the second in\n2005, thereafter tariffs to remain constant in real terms; (iv) phasing out of the differential\ncharging structure by 2005; (v) phasing out of the TMG wastewater treatment subsidy; (vi)\nimmediate cessation of the sewerage subsidy; (vii) continuation of the stormwater subsidy, in\nrecognition of the service as a public good, consistent with ADB policies.  Current and estimated\ntariffs are shown in Table A11.2.\nTable A11.2: Wastewater Treatment Component, Tariff Schedule\n(Y/cubic meter)\n2000 2003 2005\nDomestic customers\nConstant 2000 prices 0.20 0.56 1.06\nCurrent prices 0.20 0.60 1.20\nOther customers\nConstant 2000 prices 0.40 0.75 1.06\nCurrent prices 0.40 0.80 1.20\nNote: Current prices reflect the price base of the year quoted 2003, 2005.\n10.  Regular reviews of tariffs will ensure that the full cost recovery tariff rate is set at\nappropriate levels, particularly with regard to future investment plans for additional wastewater\ntreatment facilities.", "61 Appendix 11, page 3\nC. Water Resources Protection Component\n1. Costs\n11.  Costs include capital expenditures related to the project in the year they are incurred,\nincluding  physical  contingencies  but  excluding  price  contingencies.  Operations  and\nmaintenance costs include labor, equipment, power, and other costs, based on estimates from\nTML.  All components are assumed to have a life of 20 years except for civil works, which are\nassumed to have a life of 40 years.\n2.  Incremental Revenues\n12.  Incremental revenues were calculated for the component at constant 2000 prices using\nproposed incremental tariff increases and water demand projections, including consumed water\nand recycled water.  It is assumed that revenues are realized in line with the proposed schedule\nfor introducing charges.\n3. Financial Viability\n13.  The WACC is calculated at 4.4 percent discounting at international inflation rates for the\nADB loan portion and domestic inflation rates for the China Development Bank portion, and\nassuming a 6 percent real return on equity for TMG. The FIRR is calculated at 14.5 percent,\nbased on a 5 year implementation period and a 20 year operating period.\n14.  Table A11.3 summarizes the results of the analysis and sensitivity tests. The base-case\nFIRR  exceeds  the  WACC  by  around  10  percentage  points,  indicating  that  the  Project  is\nfinancially viable.  This margin is necessary, since tariff revenues are also required to pay for\nother operations of TML. Sensitivity tests show that the Project remains viable under adverse\ncost, revenue, and exchange rate assumptions.\nTable A11.3: Water Resources Protection Component, Summary Results of FIRR Analysis\nSensitivity\nFIRR\nIndicator\nBase Case 14.5\n13.2\nCosts Increase by 10% 0.91\n13.0 1.00\nRevenues Reduce by 10%\n11.8\nCosts Increase by 10% and Revenues Reduce by 10%\n12.7\nCurrency Devaluation of 30%\n12.6\nRevenues delayed by one year\nNote: The sensitivity indicator measures the proportionate decrease in the FIRR as costs increase or\nrevenues decrease.\n15.  AIFC and AIFR were calculated by discounting annual capital investment and operation\ncosts, and incremental revenues, at the WACC. The AIFR of 0.48 exceeds the AIFC of 0.20.\nThis indicates that the Project will realize positive returns. Since the FIRR exceeds the WACC,\nand the AIFR exceeds the AIFC, the Project is demonstrated to be financially viable.", "62 Appendix 11, page 4\n5. Cost Recovery\n16.  Tariff estimates are based on (i) full cost recovery; (ii) financial sustainability of TML,\nincluding non-Project operations; (iii) two tariff increases, the first in 2003 and the second in\n2005, thereafter tariffs to remain constant in real terms; (iv) continuation of the differential\npricing of consumed water and recycled water, based on their production costs; and (v) TMG\nsubsidy of the estimated cash shortfall until increased tariff revenues are realized.  Current and\nestimated tariffs are shown in Table A11.4.\nTable A11.4: Water Resources Protection Component, Tariff Schedule\n(Y/cubic meter)\n2000 2003 2005\nConsumed water\nConstant 2000 prices 0.40 0.61 0.75\nCurrent prices 0.40 0.65 0.85\nRecycled water\nConstant 2000 prices 0.13 0.20 0.25\nCurrent prices 0.13 0.22 0.28\nNote: Current prices reflect the price base of the year quoted 2003, 2005.\n17.  Regular reviews of tariffs will ensure that the full cost recovery tariff rate is set at\nappropriate levels, particularly with regard to future investment plans for additional facilities.\nD.  Affordability\n18.  Affordability for domestic consumers was considered for the year 2005, comparing a\nrange of household incomes with estimated retail water bills.  Average monthly retail water bills\nin 2005 are estimated to be Y28, double the estimated current bill of Y14. Estimated retail bills\ninclude raw water, wastewater, and an incremental tap water charge.\n19.  Charges are considered to be affordable for all income levels including the 5 percent of\nthe population considered to be poor. For an average income household, estimated combined\nwater  bills  represent  around  1.5  percent  of  income.  Even  for  the  poorest  5  percent  of\nhouseholds,  estimated  bills  represent  less  than  5  percent  of  monthly  income,  within  the\naccepted affordability range.\n20.

Economic Context\n1.  Tianjin has serious environmental problems due to a lack of adequate wastewater and\nwater resources management, which constrains the development potential of the city. Tianjin is\npart of the heavily polluted Hai River Basin, one of three river basins designated for intense\nplanning and project implementation to address environmental damage, under the national\nTranscentury Green Plan. The Hai River Pollution Prevention and Control Plan (HRPPCP)\nidentifies Tianjin as one of four priority cities requiring urgent attention, and requires that water\nin rivers meets class V standards1 and that drinking water sources meet designated national\nquality standards.\n1. Wastewater Treatment\n2.  Tianjin lacks a comprehensive wastewater management system. The existing sewage\nnetwork is overloaded and less than 50 percent of wastewater is treated. Currently, most\nsewage  is  discharged  into  the  nearest  watercourse,  polluting  the  environment,  causing\nenvironmental damage, and threatening public health. Most of the rivers currently fail to reach\nclass V water quality standards, well below the national objective set out in the HRPPCP. In\naddition, the water quality in Bohai Bay is deteriorating with consequent damage to the marine\nenvironment  and  the  incidence  of  red  tide  has  increased,  causing  damage  to  the  marine\nindustry and aquaculture.\n3.  The wastewater treatment (WWT) component forms part of the wastewater management\nplan for the city drawn up to address these problems and to enable Tianjin to meet the quality\nstandards set out in the HRPPCP. Other wastewater projects financed by agencies such as the\nWorld Bank and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), are also planned in the city.\nThe component fits well in the plan, is prioritized and well sequenced vis-\u00e0-vis the other related\nprojects.\n2. Water Resources Protection\n4.  Tianjin is heavily reliant for water supply on raw water transferred from the Luan River\nusing the Luan River Diversion (LRD) system via the Yuqiao Reservoir. The quality of water\ndelivered to water treatment works consistently fails to meet the minimum class III (footnote 1)\nwater quality standard required under the national guidelines. Investment is urgently required for\nTianjin\u2019s water source to meet the standards required by law and to ensure that the raw water\nsupply  consistently  continues  to  meet  these  standards  in  the  future.  The  water  resources\nprotection  component  will  improve  the  water  quality  in  the  Yuqiao  Reservoir  and  in  the\ndownstream water courses and restore the quality of the water supplied to the treatment works,\nto meet national guidelines. In addition the component will help guard against future risks to\nwater contamination and enable the water authority to guarantee the delivery of water at the\nrequired quality standards.\n                                                \n1 The Class III standard is one of five classes. Class I, the highest standard, is for water supply sources with limited\ntreatment and national natural reserves. Class II and III are for fishing and recreation, and may be used as water\nsupply  sources  where  full  treatment  is  employed.  Class  IV  is  suitable  for  industrial  uses  and  non-contact\nrecreational uses. The Class V standard is designated for agricultural uses and scenic viewing.", "66 Appendix 12, page 2\n3. Methodology and Approach\n5.  The analysis establishes the economic rationale, describes beneficiaries, sets out the\n\u201cwithout Project situation,\u201d assesses the need and demand for each component, and undertakes\nan analysis of alternatives. The analysis compares the calculated economic internal rate of\nreturn (EIRR) for the Project and each component to the economic opportunity cost of capital\n(EOCC), which is assumed to be 12 percent. The analysis also includes an assessment of\nnonvalued  factors,  which  are  particularly  important  for  environmental  projects,  given  the\ndifficulties of valuing benefits. The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, since benefits\nare nontradeable in nature. The analysis was done in constant 2000 prices. Detailed economic\nanalysis is available as Supplementary Appendix F.\nB. Wastewater Treatment Component\n1. Component Beneficiaries\n6.  Direct component beneficiaries include the 60 existing industries and 200,000 residents\nof the Beicang service area, and the new industries and an estimated 800,000 future residents\nthat choose to locate there. Indirect beneficiaries include users of drainage water and the\nYongdingxin  River  for  irrigation  and  all  residents  of  Tianjin  who  experience  environmental\nbenefits from a reduction in pollution. Most importantly, since the Beicang area is a planned\narea for economic growth and expansion, the component will remove what would otherwise be\na constraint to economic growth. Therefore residents are also indirect beneficiaries through\nimproved wealth and employment effects resulting from economic growth.\n2. The \u201cWithout Project\u201d Situation\n7.  Under the \u201cWithout Project\u201d scenario (i) the Beicang east area will suffer from the public\nhealth risks, odor, and amenity problems associated with the lack of a sewer system; and (ii)\ndevelopment in the Beicang area will not happen at the planned pace and the economic growth\nin the component area will be constrained, leading to a lower overall growth rate for Tianjin than\nwould occur if the Project went ahead.\n3. Demand for Wastewater Services\n8.  Demand  assessment  is  based  on  previous  work  conducted  under  the  project\npreparatory technical assistance (TA). This work established the need and demand for the\ncomponent, from existing and potential residents and industries. The social survey found that\nresidents ranked environmental improvements as a top priority to improve their quality of life.\n4. Analysis of Alternatives for Wastewater Services\n9.  Project alternatives were considered at the feasibility stage. For the WWT plant this\nincluded the type of treatment process used and location. Two alternative processes were\nconsidered. The aerobic/oxic (A/O) dephosphorization process was chosen as the preferred\noption since (i) operation and maintenance costs were lower, (ii) Tianjin Municipal Government\n(TMG) staff have experience with the A/O process, and (iii) the plant requires less land.\n10.  For the sewerage system, alternative layouts and main diameters were considered. The\nlarger diameter pipe system was chosen over the smaller piper system since it was marginally\ncheaper. In addition, local expertise is knowledgeable about the use of large pipe systems and\nthe larger pipe diameter offers more flexibility for future capacity.", "67 Appendix 12, page 3\n5. Economic Rate of Return Analysis\na. Costs\n11.  Taxes are excluded for all costs except land at a rate of 3.41 percent for local costs.\nSince the analysis is undertaken using the domestic price numeraire, tradable items were\nmultiplied by the shadow exchange rate factor (SERF), which is assumed to be 1.11.2 The\neconomic opportunity cost of land was considered. The next best alternative use of the land for\nthe WWT plant is assumed to be industrial, given surrounding uses. The cost of the land on the\nindustrial Tianjin Economic Development Area, which lies outside the city, is about Y119.94 per\nsquare meter (m2) which is 51 percent of the estimated cost per m2 for the wastewater treatment\nplant site, and 80 percent of the cost estimated for pumping stations. The conversion factors for\nland are assumed to be 0.51 and 0.8 respectively.\n12.  A conversion rate of 0.8 is applied to unskilled labor since there is considerable surplus\nlabor in many state industries. No conversion factor is applied to skilled labor. Economic costs\nare phased over the planning period of the Project, which is assumed to be 25 years.\nb. Benefits\n13.  The component will provide direct benefits to users and reduce the health risks, odor,\nand  environmental  damage  that  would  otherwise  occur.  The  approximate  reduction  of\nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD) suspended solids in the component area is 23 tons per day,\nequivalent to 8,395 tons per year. It will also provide indirect benefits to the central Beicang\nsubarea through alleviating the overloading of the sewerage system that currently occurs.\n14.  The  health  and  environmental  benefits  of  the  component  are  difficult  to  value.\nWillingness to pay for wastewater tends to be undervalued, since the benefits are largely\nunseen. The social survey showed a relatively low willingness to pay for the service, about an\nadditional Y2.2 per month than is currently being paid. This value is considered to considerably\nunderstate the true willingness to pay, and is not used in the valuation of benefits. Health data\ndoes not provide reliable estimates of illness or disease associated with the lack of wastewater\nmanagement. The environmental benefits are valued using the incremental tariff revenue for the\nservice area of Beicang, which acts as a proxy for the value of environmental improvements.\n15.  The irrigation potential of effluent from the WWT plant provides an additional economic\nbenefit. The effluent would provide irrigation water to the nearby farms, during the dry period\nwhen the rivers run dry and there is little water available for irrigation. What water could be used\nwill therefore be in demand and can thus be considered as an additional economic benefit. The\npotential land area that could be irrigated is estimated at 3.67 million m2. The net additional\noutput is valued at Y22 million per year, when the wastewater treatment plant is running at full\ncapacity.\nd. Nonvalued Benefits\n16.  The component offers economic growth benefits that are not encapsulated in the EIRR\ncalculation. The Project facilitates the development of a new growth area of the city, where\nindustry and housing will be located. Without the Project, some of this new development will\nlocate elsewhere in Tianjin, but some of the investment and growth will either happen later or\nnot occur. Thus this incremental economic growth effect should be considered an economic\nbenefit providing employment, wealth generation, and poverty reduction effects.\n                                                \n2 The SERF is the reciprocal of the standard conversion factor SCF, which is estimated to be 0.1. Therefore the\nSERF is estimated at 1.11. See Supplementary Appendix E for a more detailed discussion.", "68 Appendix 12, page 4\n17.  The component provides wastewater facilities for all residents of the Beicang service\narea regardless of income. In fact, since the poor and lower income household are (i) less able\nto afford health services, and (ii) more likely to live in poorly maintained housing close to open\nsewers, they are more at risk from the negative impacts under the current situation and will\nbenefit more than the average person under the Project. Sewer connections are provided and\nincluded in costs of the component, thus low-income residents are not excluded. Including\nsewer connections also helps to reduce the risk of benefits not being realized.\ne. Results\n18.  Sensitivity assumptions are taken to be 10 percent. Table A12.1 summarizes the results\nof the EIRR analysis and the sensitivity tests and Table A12.2 (page 72) shows the calculation.\nThe base case EIRR is 15.2, percent exceeding the EOCC of 12 percent. Sensitivity tests show\nthat costs would have to increase by 19 percent and benefits would have to fall by 16 percent\nfor the EIRR only falls below the EOCC. The EIRR falls below the EOCC under the sensitivity\ntests where costs increase by 10 percent and benefits decrease by 10 percent. However, these\nevents are considered unlikely. The component is economically viable since the EIRR exceeds\nthe EOCC and the component also demonstrates other additional nonvalued benefits.\nTable A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests\nSensitivity Switching\nEIRR\nIndicator Value\nBase Case 15.2%\nCosts Increase by 10% 13.4% 0.89 19%\nBenefits Reduce by 10% 13.3% 0.96 16%\nCosts Increase by 10% and benefits  11.5%\nReduce by 10%\nBenefits Delayed by 1 Year 12.5%\nC. Water Resources Protection Component\n1. Component Beneficiaries\n19.  Beneficiaries are the water users or end customers of the LRD system. This includes a\npopulation  of  approximately  5  million  people,  institutions,  industries,  and  commercial\nestablishments. Water is also a necessity for many of the industries along the Hai River,\nparticularly the power plants, which use the water for cooling and recycle it. Water supply\ncompanies will benefit from an improvement in the quality of their raw material, which is likely to\nresult in cost savings in traditional treatment, and a reduction in water losses from flushing and\nbackwashing. In addition farmers living near the Zhou River will benefit through land being\nbrought back into agricultural production.\n2. The \u201cWithout Project\u201d Situation\n20.  \u201cWithout the Project,\u201d the raw water supply for Tianjin will not meet the current required\nnational standards for water supply. Nor is it likely to meet these standards in the future. Due to\nthe recent increase in pollution, the water quality is likely to deteriorate further. Since there is no\nalternative water supply, the \u201cwithout Project situation\u201d implies a situation in which there is no\ndrinking  water  supply  for  Tianjin,  resulting  in  very  severe  economic  consequences.  The\neconomic analysis assumes that the \u201cwithout Project situation\u201d is less severe and that the LRD", "69 Appendix 12, page 5\nwater is an acceptable source for the city. However, it does assume that the current problems of\npollution continue and that there is a real risk from contamination of the drinking water in the\nfuture, which is required by Government to be mitigated. The project addresses the issue of\nupstream pollution since control of pollution outside the scope of this project is critical for this\nProject  to  achieve  expected  benefits.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  involved  in\npollution control activity through (i) a recently completed TA, (ii) a second TA under way in the\nHai River basin, and (iii) another proposed loan. As part of an integrated strategy and in close\ncoordination with other funding agencies, the risk of upstream pollution mitigating the positive\nbenefits of this Project is considered to be acceptable.\n3. Need and Demand for Raw Water\n21.  The demand for raw water from the Luan-Tianjin diversion comes from industries along\nthe Hai River; Tianjin Water Supply Company, which is the major water supply company for\nurban Tianjin; and six other small water supply companies in the coastal and suburban areas.\nGiven the potential demand for Tianjin Municipality and supply of water from all sources (not just\nthe  Luan-Tianjin  diversion)  as  estimated  by  the  TMDPC,  for  the  municipality  demand  will\noutstrip supply by 2010. This emphasizes the requirement for new water sources, primarily\nother river diversions.\n22.  Domestic demand projections are based on population and households and assume an\nincrease in per capita water consumption from around 100 to 147 liters per day by 2020, which\nis consistent with assumed income growth and behavioral patterns, and brings average water\nconsumption more in line with other Asian cities.\n23.  Since current water consumption is low compared to other countries there is less need\nor scope for demand management measures through water pricing. Tariff levels are currently\nvery low and planned increases to establish full cost recovery pricing will help to establish\ndemand management principles. However, estimated forecasts of demand indicate that the\nincome effect will outweigh the price effect over the project period.\n4. Analysis of Alternatives for the Supply of Raw Water\n24.  Three options were considered for the Zhou River diversion channel carrying water from\nYuqiao Reservoir to Juiwangzhuang Gate: an open water channel, a box culvert, and a pipeline.\nHowever, the three options do not give the same output since an open water channel does not\noffer the degree of protection of the water supply that the underground options do. The open\nchannel is considered as an alternative because it would not guard against the future risk of\ncontamination is a critical objective of the Project. The underground options have better safety\nand  aesthetic  values  for  the  local  residents  and  avoid  the  dis-benefits  associated  with\npermanent  division  of  agricultural  land  plots,  in  particular  access  to  land  which  makes\nimplementation easier. There are also technical engineering and environmental advantages.\n25.  The pipeline and the boxed culvert were costed in detail by the Water Conservancy\nSurvey and Design Institute. The boxed culvert option has been preferred since it has all the\nadvantages of an underground option and the lower cost.\n5. Economic Rate of Return Analysis\na. Costs\n26.  Financial costs were converted to economic costs using the same SERF, tax rate, and\nconversion rates for labor as for the wastewater component. The main costs for resettlement\nare for the reservoir component, where farmers and fish-farmers will be compensated for their", "70 Appendix 12, page 6\nloss of income and livelihood. No conversion factors were applied since the payments are\nmeant to reflect reasonable losses.\nb. Economic Benefits\n27.  Raw water quality will be improved so that it consistently meets the national standard,\nand the future quality of the water will be ensured through the adequate protection of the water\nsource and the conveyance system.\n28.  The  improvement  in  current  raw  water  quality  and  the  reduced  risk  of  future\ncontamination will not be fully appreciated or experienced by the end-users. These sorts of\nbenefits are largely \u201cinvisible\u201d to the end user and under these circumstances, the revealed\nwillingness to pay tends to understate the true willingness to pay. The social survey showed a\nreasonably low willingness to pay for improved water quality at just under Y3 per month. This\nvalue is not considered to be a true reflection, which would require a full understanding of the\npotential risks that would be averted under the Project.\n29.  The valuation of benefits uses a resource cost savings approach assuming that, at the\nvery least, the standards of drinking water quality must be met, if not through Government\ninvestment, then by the water distribution companies themselves. Under this situation, the water\ndistribution companies would be required to invest in some sort of advanced water treatment to\ntry to mitigate the failure of the raw water to meet the required standard.\n30.  There are also benefits from the Project to farmland close to the Zhou River, which\ncurrently is periodically flooded with contaminated water that cannot be released into the river\nsystem. Approximately 400.2 million m2 is affected. Thus under the Project, this land will be\nbrought back into agricultural production, and the annual net additional output is conservatively\nvalued at Y158 million.\nc. Nonvalued Benefits\n31.  The Project offers other benefits, which are not encapsulated in the EIRR calculation.\nThere is some very marginal increase in water supply capacity, since less water is needed for\nflushing, as well as shorter period when the system is shut down. This water, however, is not\nneeded to meet demand until well after the year 2010. There is also a flood control benefit to the\nProject since the additional water conveyance downstream from the reservoir increases the\ncapacity  of  water  than  can  be  released  from  the  reservoir  during  times  of  flood.  Most\nimportantly,  the  Project  provides  and  protects  the  water  supply  of  the  city,  without  which\neconomic activity would be threatened. When considered against the alternative scenario, the\neconomic gains are significant.\n32.  As  with  the  wastewater  component,  the  component  does  not  differentiate  between\nincome levels of beneficiaries: all Tianjin residents will have access to the improved water\nsupply system. However, the poor are likely to suffer more without the project situation, where\nfor example the cost of diverting water from other sources will be higher or residents may be\nrequired  to  buy  bottled  water.  The  poor  are  more  vulnerable  and  will  be  above  average\nbeneficiaries of the Project.\nd. Results of the EIRR Analysis\n33.  Sensitivity assumptions are taken to be 10 percent. Table A12.3 summarizes the results\nof the EIRR analysis and the sensitivity tests and Table A12.4 (page 73) shows the calculation.\nThe base case EIRR is 14.7 percent, which exceeds the EOCC of 12 percent. Costs would\nhave to increase by 24 percent and benefits would have to fall by 20 percent for the EIRR to fall\nbelow the EOCC. Even under the worst case sensitivity test, where costs increase by 10", "71 Appendix 12, page 7\npercent and benefits decrease by 10 percent, the EIRR does not fall below the EOCC. The\nEIRR calculation demonstrates that the component is economically viable. However, the margin\nby which the EIRR exceeds the EOCC fails to reflect the true economic worth of the Project,\nwhich is considered to be much higher, since the potential impact of not undertaking the\ncomponent has severe economic consequences.\nTable A12.3: Water Resources Component\nEconomic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Tests\nSensitivity Switching\nEIRR\nIndicator Value\nBase Case 14.7%\nCosts Increase by 10% 13.4% 0.62 24%\nBenefits Reduce by 10% 13.3% 0.69 20%\nCosts Increase by 10% and Benefits  12.1%\nReduce by 10%\nBenefits Delayed by 1 Year 13.0%\nD. Overall Project Analysis and Conclusions\n1. Project EIRR Analysis\n34.  The above analysis indicates that both the components are economically viable and that\nthey stand up to sensitivity tests where costs increase and revenues decrease. The EIRR for\nthe total Project has also been calculated. Since components are mutually exclusive, the sum of\nthe costs and benefits for individual components has been used for the overall Project. The\nrelative size of the component in terms of costs and benefits means that the results of the\nproject  analysis  are  reasonably  similar  to  those  for  the  other  component.  Table  A12.5\nsummarizes the results and Table A12.6 shows the calculation. The base case EIRRs is 14.8\npercent, which exceeds the EOCC of 12 percent. The economic analysis demonstrates the\neconomic viability of the two components and the overall Project. Especially since significant\nbenefits have not been valued in the EIRR analysis, the Project is economically worthwhile.\nTable A12.5: Project Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Test\nSensitivity Switching\nEIRR\nIndicator Value\nBase Case 14.8\nCosts Increase by 10% 13.4% 0.66 23%\nBenefits Reduce by 10% 13.3% 0.74 19%\nCosts Increase by 10% and Benefits  12.1%\nReduce by 10%\nBenefits Delayed by 1 Year 12.9%", "Table A12.2: Economic Analysis, Wastewater Treatment Component\n(Y million)\nBase Financial Costs Economic Costs Economic Benefits Sensitivity Tests\nYear Capital O&M Total Capital O&M Total Incremental Irrigated Total Net Costs Benefits Costs plus & Benefits\nCost Cost Cost Cost Cost Cost Revenue Land Benefits Benefits Plus Less benefits less delayed by\n10% 10% 10% one year\n2000          16      16        1 6 16 0 0 -16 -18 -16 -18 -16\n2001          87      87        9 0 90 0 0 -91 -100 -91 -100 -90\n2002          79      79        8 2 82 -1 -1 -83 -91 -83 -91 -83\n2003          60      60        6 3 63 23 23 -40 -47 -43 -49 -64\n2004          26      26        2 7       27    23 23 -
