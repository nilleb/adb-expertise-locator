The Project has two parts. Part\nA  consists  of  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  including\nconstruction  of  sewer  mains  and  pump  stations  connected  to  a\ntreatment plant in the Beicang area. Part B consists of protecting\nTianjin\u2019s  sole  raw  water  supply,  including  the  watershed  of  the\nYuqiao  Reservoir;  a  dedicated  34-kilometer  closed  conduit\ndownstream  to  avoid  the  pollution  in  the  passage  through  the\nZhou  River;  and  improvements  to  the  existing  open  channel\nfurther downstream.\n\nPrimary:\nSecondary:\n\nEnvironment\nHuman Development\n\nCategory  A.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was\nundertaken and the summary EIA was circulated to the Board on\n28 February 2000.\n\nTianjin, the PRC\u2019s fourth largest city, has 9.6 million people and is\na  municipality  with  the  status  of  a  province,  similar  to  Beijing,\nChongqing, and Shanghai. A high priority in Tianjin\u2019s development\nas  a  major  industrial  center  has  been  to  improve  the  urban\nenvironment in the densely settled city center, including relocating\nindustry, promoting new industrial developments, and encouraging\nthe development of clean and high-technology industry. More than\nhalf  of  Tianjin\u2019s  wastewater  is  discharged  untreated  into  canals,\nrivers, and Bohai Bay. Increasing pollution in the Hai River Basin\nthreatens  the  city\u2019s  sole  raw  water  supply.  If  left  unchecked,  the\npollution  may  have  catastrophic  consequences  on  economic\ngrowth  and  the  health  and  well-being  of  Tianjin\u2019s  populace.\nContinued  sustainable  economic  growth  is  required  to  help\nalleviate  increasing  urban  poverty.  Attention  must  be  given  to\nimproved  wastewater  management  and  environmental  protection\nof  the  city's  raw  water  source  for  such  growth  to  be  sustainable.\nThe  Project  addresses  two  high-priority  components  in  the\nwastewater  and  water  resources  sectors.  (i)  The  Beicang\nwastewater  treatment  (WWT)  component  will  enhance  urban\nenvironmental  and  public  health  conditions,  contribute  to  a\ncomprehensive  wastewater  management  program  for  the  Hai\nRiver Basin, and help mitigate the pollution loading in Bohai Bay,\na key marine and fisheries resource that increasingly suffers from\nred tide and other effects of untreated wastewater effluent. (ii) The\nwater  resources  protection  (WRP)  component  will  address  the\nsingle  raw  water  supply  source,  the  Luan-Tianjin  water  diversion\nsystem,  which  serves  5  million  people  who  are  currently  at  risk\n\n\fObjectives and\nScope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount \nand Terms\n\n \n\niii\n\nfrom  increasing  pollution.  The  WRP  component  will  eliminate  the\nsources  of  pollution  to  the  raw  water  system  that  are  within\nTianjin's  control,  and  lend  credibility  to  Tianjin's  demands  for\npollution  control  of  the  upstream  pollution  sources  in  Hebei\nProvince.  The  WRP  component  also  incorporates  the  best\npractices  for  comprehensive  watershed  management  within  the\nYuqiao  Reservoir  watershed,  and  will  reduce  the  future  pollution\nrisks  to  a  more  manageable  level.  The  Project  is  an  important\ncomponent  of  a  comprehensive  approach  to  address  pollution  in\nthe Hai River Basin, which will serve as a model for replication in\nthe PRC.\n\nThe  main  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  improve  (i)  the  urban\nenvironment  by  reducing  environmental  contamination  through\nimproved  wastewater  management,  and  (ii)  the  quality  of  raw\nwater  supply  in  Tianjin.  Related  objectives  include  strengthening\nthe capacity of the raw water supply and wastewater operations to\nbe  more  efficient  and  managed  on  commercial  principles,\nintroducing  comprehensive  watershed  management  approaches,\nand improving cost recovery from users through an improved tariff\nstructure with gradual increases to achieve full cost recovery.\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  $340.7  million  equivalent,  including  a\nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $169.2  million  (49  percent)  and  a  local\ncurrency cost of $171.5 million equivalent (51 percent).\n\nSource\n\nA.

The  loan  proceeds  will  be\nrelent  by  the  central  Government  to  the  Tianjin  Municipal\nGovernment (TMG) on the same terms and conditions as the ADB\nloan. TMG will onlend the loan proceeds to the Tianjin Sewerage\nCompany (TSC) and the Tianjin Municipal Luanhe Drinking Water\nSource  Protection  Engineering,  Ltd  (TML)  through  onlending\nterms  and  agreements  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the\n\n\fiv\n\nADB  loan.  The  two  companies  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange\nand  interest  rate  variation  risks  for  the  ADB  loan  while  TMG  will\nassume the intermediation and transaction costs.\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2006\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n \n\nTianjin Municipal Government \n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nThe  Tianjin  Municipal  Development  Planning  Commission\n(TMDPC),  under  the  overall  direction  and  guidance  of  the  TMG\nleading  group  headed  by  the  deputy  executive  mayor  of  Tianjin,\nwill coordinate project implementation work through various design\ninstitutes  and  the  Project\u2019s  Implementation  Agencies.  TSC  and\nTML will be responsible for day-to-day project management.\n\nADB-financed  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major\ncontracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered  through\ninternational  competitive  bidding  or \ninternational  shopping\nprocedures, depending on the contract amount. In accordance with\nADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in the bidding\nfor local competitive bidding contracts.\n\ninstitutional,  managerial, \n\nAbout  65  person-months  of  international  and  130  person-months\nof  domestic  consulting  will  be  required,  with  expertise \nin\ninternational  competitive  bidding  and \ninternational  shopping\nprocedures,  including  international  specifications,  bid  evaluation,\ncontracts,  quality  control,  and  project  performance  management\nsystems.  The  consultants  will  provide  guidance  and  training  for\ncapacity  building  to  ensure  that  (i)  the  two  Implementing  Agencies\nare  able  to  function  as  effective  project  management  units;  (ii)\nfinancial,  and  operational\nappropriate \narrangements  are  in  place  to  enhance  operational  effectiveness,\nmanagement  efficiency,  and \nthe\nImplementation  Agencies  are  converted  from  construction  into\noperating  companies  upon  completion  of  implementation;  and  (iv)\nsocial,  resettlement,  and  environmental  impacts  are  monitored.\nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Detailed  design  engineering  and\nconstruction  supervision  will  be  carried  out  by  qualified  local\ndesign  institutes  recruited  by  TMDPC;  these  services  will  not  be\nfinanced by ADB.\n\nfinancial  sustainability; \n\n(iii) \n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\n \n\n31 December 2005\n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  9.6  million  urban  residents  in  the\nTianjin  urban  area  whose  living  conditions  and  public  health\nstandards will be improved through the removal of about 100,000\n\n\fv\n\ncubic  meters  per  day  of  untreated  sewage  from  the  area,  and\nprotection  of  the  city's  sole  raw  water  supply  from  the  serious\nthreat of increasing pollution. These environmental improvements\nwill  stimulate  economic  activity,  support  sustainable  economic\ngrowth, enhance the image of Tianjin as an international city, and\ncontribute  to  a  comprehensive  model  program  for  river  basin\nmanagement  and  cross-jurisdictional  pollution  prevention  and\ncontrol.  The  Project  will  bring  about  40,000  hectares  of  flood-\nprone  agricultural  land  into  full  productive  use,  and  reduce\npollution added to Bohai Bay, a critical marine resource.\n\nThe Project has been designed to mitigate all construction-related\nenvironmental impacts and adequate provision has been made to\nfully compensate the estimated 10,700 people adversely affected\nby the Project, primarily due to temporary and permanent loss of\nland. Physical relocation of 12 households (56 affected people) is\nexpected.  Extensive  consultation  with  affected  people  is  being\nundertaken  as  outlined  in  a  comprehensive  resettlement  plan,\nwhich will be made publicly available prior to any ground leveling\nor  construction.  A  summary  resettlement  plan,  made  publicly\navailable in the PRC prior to loan negotiations, is available on the\nADB website.\n\nThe  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  preventing\nincreases  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  to  reduce\nspending  on  medical  care  and  sick  days  taken,  thus  providing\nmore  income  to  households;  (ii)  safeguarding  the  quality  of\ndrinking  water  and  improving  wastewater  services,  as  poverty\ngoes  beyond  income  levels  and  includes  deprivation  of  essential\nassets and opportunities to which every human is entitled such as\nclean  water  and  a  clean  environment;  and  (iii)  providing\nemployment  opportunities  to  women  through  the  All  China\nWomen\u2019s Federation.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  direct  benefits,  the  Project  will  help  support\neconomic  growth.  The  policy  dialogue  for  tariff  reforms  and  cost\nrecovery  undertaken  during  project  processing  will  help  eliminate\nexisting subsidies. Wastewater and water tariffs will be increased\nto  ensure  full  cost  recovery  is  achieved  by  2005,  the  first  year  of\noperation  of  the  new  systems.  As  a  result  of  ongoing  policy\ndialogue,  TMG  increased  wastewater  and  water  tariffs  by  62\npercent in November 1999. An affordability analysis estimates tariffs\nunder the Project to be an acceptable 4.5 percent of income for the\npoorest 5 percent of households and 1.5 percent for mean income\nhouseholds by the year 2005.\n\n\fvi\n\n\f1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water\nResources Protection Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2. \nThe  Project  is  in  Tianjin,  the  PRC\u2019s  fourth  largest  city.  Tianjin  has  a  population  of  9.6\nmillion,  is  a  municipality  with  the  status  of  a  province,  similar  to  Beijing,  Chongqing,  and\nShanghai, and is a major industrial center. Tianjin lies between Beijing and the coast of Bohai\nBay, at the mouth of rivers forming the heavily polluted Hai River Basin. Seven of the nine major\nrivers in the basin flow through Tianjin to Bohai Bay. The Project is one of a number of planned\nwastewater  treatment  and  water  resources  protection  projects  under  the  Hai  River  Basin\nPollution  Prevention  and  Control  Plan  (HRPPCP),  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB). This basinwide program comprises more than 600 potential projects, of which the high-\npriority  projects  will  be  implemented  under  the  PRC  Transcentury  Green  Plan.  Tianjin  is  a\npriority  area  under  the  plan,  and  the  components  of  the  Project  have  been  selected  for\nimmediate implementation under the HRPPCP.\n\nIn 1999, ADB approved a technical assistance (TA) to help TMG formulate the Project.1\n3. \nThe TA study reviewed the feasibility studies prepared by local design institutes and confirmed\nthe need to improve wastewater collection and treatment and to protect Tianjin's sole raw water\nsupply  source  from  the  increasing  threat  of  pollution.  The  final  TA  report  was  presented  in\nFebruary  2000.  The  results  of  TA  reports,  Government  feasibility  studies,  the  findings  of  ADB\nmissions,2 and extensive discussions with Government officials and project beneficiaries during\nvisits  to  Tianjin  from  the  basis  of  this  report.  The  linkages  between  the  goals,  objectives,\noutputs, and inputs for the proposed Project are in the project logical framework (Appendix 1).\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\nIII. BACKGROUND\n\n4. \nConcurrent  with  the  relatively  high  economic  growth  in  the  past  20  years,  the  PRC's\nurban  population  in  668  cities  has  been  growing  rapidly,  increasing  from  about  190  million  in\n1980 to 376 million, or 31 percent of the total population in 1999. These estimates exclude the\n\u201cfloating\u201d  population,3  which  has  grown  rapidly  during  the  past  10  years,  particularly  in  larger\ncities. Rapid rural to urban migration is expected to continue in the foreseeable future and about\n700 million people, equivalent to 45 percent of the population, are expected to live in cities by\n2010.  Growth  of  the  urban  economy  and  populations  has  placed  pressure  on  an  overloaded\nurban infrastructure while increasing the threat of water pollution.\n\n                                                \n1 TA 3216-PRC: Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water Resources Protection, for $800,000, approved on 2 July\n\n1999.\n\n2  The  appraisal  mission  was  fielded  from  15-25  May  2000,  and  comprised  M.  Westfall,  Urban  Development\nSpecialist-Mission  Leader;  Y.L.  Feng,  Environment  Specialist;  S.  Price,  Sr.  Social  Development  Specialist;  O.\nTiwana, Counsel; M. Varkay, Programs Officer; T. Chien, Environmental Engineer-Staff Consultant; M. Diab, Social\nSpecialist-Staff Consultant; F. Waters, Economic-Financial Analyst-Staff Consultant; W. Yan, Tariff Specialist-Staff\nConsultant.\n\n3  The floating population includes transient workers and informal commercial traders who live in the urban center full-\nor part-time, but who do not have residency permits, and the unskilled workers and farmers who enter the urban\narea for day labor and the markets. The floating population is estimated to be between 70 million and 100 million\npeople.\n\n\f2\n\nThe growing need for basic urban services resulting from ongoing rapid urban growth is\n5. \nincreasingly constraining the physical and financial capacity of most cities to provide adequate\nwater infrastructure for the delivery of clean, safe water supply. This has led to a deterioration of\nthe  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents,  degradation  of  the  urban  environment,  and  inefficient\neconomic  development.  The  situation  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  pollution  of  raw  water\nsources(cid:190)\nlakes,  rivers,  reservoirs,  local  streams,  canals,  and  groundwater  sources(cid:190) by\nuntreated or partially treated municipal and industrial wastewater. Because of the seriousness of\nthe  situation,  the  Government  is  paying  increasing  attention  to  water  resources  management\nand  pollution  control.  Large-scale  investments  in  water  supply  and  water  resources  protection\nwill be needed in the foreseeable future to improve the living conditions of urban residents and\nto sustain economic growth.\n\nDuring the era of the centrally planned economy, the provision of water was considered\n6. \na basic social need and was heavily subsidized by the Government. Water tariffs in many cities\nremained unchanged for 20-40 years. As a result, water supply companies (WSCs) did not have\nsufficient  financial  resources  to  expand  or  to  operate  and  maintain  existing  systems.  Also,\nconsumers  had  no  market-oriented  incentives  to  conserve  water.  Beginning  in  the  mid-1980s,\nthe need for tariff adjustments was recognized because of inflation and demand growth fueled\nby  rapid  economic  growth.  Under  the  Government's  ongoing  market-based  reforms,  all  WSCs\nand  new  water  supply  projects,  including  those  dealing  with  raw  water  supply  delivery,  are\nrequired to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. Between 1986 and 1996,\nthere were major increases in water tariffs, averaging 17-20 percent annually. This reflects the\nGovernment's  commitment  to  bring  commercial  principles  to  the  water  sector.  Despite  these\nincreases, water tariffs are still low, and need to be increased in many cities.\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  is  responsible  for  the  planning  and\n7. \nadministration of water resources. It manages the water intake permit system; coordinates water\nresource  use  among  the  different  sectors;  formulates  interregional  and  interprovincial  water\nallocation  and  distribution  alternatives;  and  prepares  long-term  water  demand  projections  and\nsupply plans at the central, provincial, and municipal levels. The Ministry of Construction (MOC),\nthrough  the  provincial  and  municipal  construction  commissions,  is  responsible  for  overseeing\nurban  plans  for  major  cities,  including  plans  and  investments  for  urban  wastewater  treatment\n(WWT) and water resources protection.\n\n8. \nThe State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), through its policies and programs,\nplays an important role in the development of sound environmental practices in the PRC water\nsector.  The  SEPA\u2019s  major  responsibilities  include  (i)  developing  national  environmental\nprotection  policies,  strategies,  laws,  and  administrative  regulations;  (ii)  coordinating  and\nproviding  guidance  on  major  environmental  issues;  (iii)  developing  national  environmental\nstandards;  and  (iv)  administering  the  national  environmental  certification  system  and  the\nmonitoring and information network.\n\nPrivate  sector  participation  in  the  PRC\u2019s  water  sector  is  still  at  a  very  early  stage  of\n9. \ndevelopment.  The  major  source  of  financing  continues  to  be  Government  equity  and  grants\nsupplemented by domestic loans and official development assistance. Between 1991 and 1997,\nthe local governments spent Y50 billion ($6.0 billion) on water supply. The investment required\nfor urban water supply is estimated to be Y74 billion ($8.9 billion) between 1997 and 2000, a 48\npercent  increase  over  expenditures  in  the  1991  to  1997  period.  The  Government  recognizes\nthat  greater  efforts  are  required  to  mobilize  private  sector  funding.  In  1991,  the  Government\n\n\f3\n\nadopted  a  policy  to  allow  foreign  investment  in  the  sector.  For  infrastructure  projects,  the\nGovernment is experimenting with the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.4\n\n10.  Water pollution remains a serious problem in most PRC cities. In the early 1990s only a\nsmall amount of wastewater generated by cities was treated and an even lower percentage met\nnational  discharge  standards.  This  problem  is  being  progressively  tackled  by  the  Government\nwithin both the eighth and ninth five-year plans. Initial efforts have focused on industrial WWT;\nby the end of 1997 an estimated 62 percent of industrial discharges met the relevant standard,\nup from 20 percent reported earlier in the decade. All industrial discharges must comply with the\nstandard by the end of 2000. Investment is also being made in municipal WWT but progress is\nslower, with only approximately 20 percent of wastewater from an urban population in excess of\n400  million  receiving  adequate  treatment.  Municipal  wastewater  is  therefore  a  major  cause  of\npollution in streams, rivers, lakes, and some coastal waters.\n\n11. \nTo improve the quality of life of urban populations and to achieve sustainable growth and\ndevelopment,  better  environmental  quality  is  necessary.  Large  investments  are  required  to\naddress  these  problems  along  with  improved  legal,  regulatory,  and  enforcement  frameworks,\nand  the  provision  of  market-based  incentives  designed  to  encourage  environmental-friendly\nproduction  practices.  The  Government  has  recognized  that  pollution  of  water  resources  is  a\nmajor  threat  to  sustainable  development  and  health  of  the  PRC\u2019s  large  urban  population.\nEnvironmental issues were accorded high priority during the National People\u2019s Congress held in\nBeijing  in  March  1998.  The  congress  recognized  that  the  degradation  of  the  PRC\u2019s  water\nsystems,  in  particular  lakes  and  rivers,  requires  urgent  attention.  The  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan\n(1996-2000) aims to invest Y12 billion ($1.4 billion) in the 52 most polluted cities, mostly in the\neastern provinces, for the construction of wastewater treatment plants and collection systems.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n12. \nThe  Government  has  identified  urban  wastewater  and  water  resources  as  priority\nsectors of the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing water\nsources;  (ii)  protecting  existing  sources  by  controlling  industrial  and  residential  pollution  in\nrivers, lakes, and reservoirs; (iii) controlling overextraction from groundwater resources; and (iv)\nimproving  demand  management  by  introducing  water-saving  technologies  and  operations  and\nusing  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms.  Guidelines  emphasize  (i)  proper  planning  and  the\ninclusion  of  wastewater  and  water  supply  projects  in  economic  development  plans;  (ii)\nmobilizing  financial  resources  from  users  and  from  various  Government  sources  for  the\nconstruction  of  new  facilities;  (iii)  full  cost  recovery  from  industrial  and  commercial  users  and\nrecovery  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  from  residential  users  by  the  year  2000;\n(iv)  use  of  loans  and  credit  to  finance  projects;  and  (v)  application  of  new  technology  where\nappropriate.\n\n13. \nThe Government has formulated a number of programs to address water shortages and\nwater quality. Many of the programs are supported by ADB and other bilateral and multilateral\nagencies.  Generally,  the  investments  are  funded  locally  or  supported  by  concessional  aid,\nrather  than  loans  on  commercial  terms.  The  Government  is  increasingly  concerned  about  the\nneed  for  policy  reform  and  capacity  building  to  improve  water  resource  management,  and  to\nintroduce  cost-recovery  techniques  and  enable  water  delivery  programs  to  be  financially  self-\nsustaining.\n\n                                                \n4 A  construction  agreement  on  the  first  urban  water  infrastructure  project  for  Chengdu  City,  approved  by  the\nGovernment to investigate the use of foreign funds under the BOT methodology, was signed in July 1998, and was\nthe result of ADB assistance in structuring and partially financing the project. Official construction started in early\n1999 with completion expected in September 2001.\n\n\f4\n\nEnvironmental  policies  were  initially  developed  in  the  1980s,  when  a  system  of\n14. \nenvironmental  management  was  put  in  place,5  including  standards  for  airborne  emissions,\nwastewater  effluents,  and  solid  waste  disposal.6  Policies  addressing  environmental  problems\nwere  contained  in  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan,  which  emphasized  strict  compliance  with\nenvironmental  protection  laws  and  regulations.  Major  achievements  included  (i)  requiring\nenvironmental impact assessments (EIA) for new investment projects;7 (ii) using fees, fines, and\ncompensation  payments  to  implement  the  polluter-pays  principle;  (iii)  using  the  target\nresponsibility system, which involves the establishment of contracts with local governments and\nagencies  setting  out  environmental  targets  and  goals;  and  (iv)  strengthening  environmental\nmanagement  at  the  national  and  local  levels.  In  the  1990s,  SEPA  developed  a  more\ncomprehensive  strategy  to  address  industrial  pollution  prevention  and  control.  Solutions  have\nbeen shifted from end-of-pipe treatment toward an emphasis on cleaner production processes,\nan initiative ADB is supporting.\n\n15. \nBecause  of  the  severity  of  urban  environmental  problems,  the  Government  has  made\ncities  the  focal  point  of  its  environmental  protection  efforts.  The  Government's  program  for\ncomprehensive  improvement  of  the  urban  environment  emphasizes  (i)  reducing  air  pollution\nthrough  improved  coal-burning  methods,  more  extensive  use  of  natural  gas  and  coal,  and  the\nintroduction of clean coal technology; (ii) upgrading basic infrastructure including water supply,\ndrainage, and the protection of water resources; (iii) reducing vehicular pollution; and (iv) urban\nreforestation.  ADB  has  helped  the  Government  improve  environmental  conditions  in  selected\nmedium-sized  cities  by  preparing  environmental  improvement  programs  and  supporting  action\nplans,8 which are being used to guide development in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\n16. \nIn 1996, the State Council issued guidelines requiring all major cities to give priority to\nenvironmental  protection  and  management.  SEPA  has  identified  47  priority  cities,  including\nTianjin,  for  improved  environmental  protection,  and  included  the  environmental  improvement\nprograms  for  these  cities  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan.  ADB  has  supported  these  efforts  by\nhelping  to  upgrade  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  senior  local  government  officials  in  the  priority\ncities  to  plan  and  implement  environmental  infrastructure,  and  to  develop  and  enforce  local\nenvironmental policies, rules, and regulations.9\n\n17. \nEnvironmental  protection  is  now  clearly  established  as  a  national  priority  in  the  PRC\u2019s\ndevelopment  strategy,  with  all  medium-  and  long-term  investment  plans  incorporating\nenvironmental  sustainability  as  a  fundamental  component.  The  Government\u2019s  continuing\nemphasis on price and enterprise reforms, aimed at improving industrial efficiency and providing\ngreater  autonomy  and  accountability  at  the  enterprise  level  complements  the  environmental\npolicies  and  regulations.  Price  liberalization  will  promote  environment-friendly  behavior  by\nencouraging  energy  efficiency  and  resource  conservation.  The  Government  is  increasing  the\n\n                                                \n5  ADB  supported  this  process  by  providing  TA  987-PRC: Institutional Strengthening of the National Environmental\n\nProtection Agency, for $340,000, approved on 10 June 1988.\n\n6 This includes the Law on Solid Waste Pollution Prevention and Treatment, covering hazardous and toxic wastes,\nwhich was formulated in 1996. Progress on classification of hazardous and toxic wastes is ongoing with assistance\nfrom the World Bank.\n\n7 ADB  has  made  major  contributions  under  TA  987-PRC  (footnote  5);  TA  1436-PRC:  Environmental  Impact\nAssessment and Training,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  10  December  1990;  TA  1988-PRC: Environmental Impact\nAssessment and Training,  for  $900,000,  approved  on  18  November  1993;  and  TA  2975-PRC:  Environmental\nImpact Assessment and Training, for $600,000, approved on 31 December 1997.\n\n8 TA 2456-PRC: Pilot Environmental Plans for Selected Medium-size Cities, for $537,000, approved on 4 December\n\n9 TA 2906-PRC: Leadership Training on Urban Environmental Management in Key Cities, for $600,000, approved on\n\n1995.\n\n3 November 1997.\n\n\f5\n\npollution  levy,  while  improving  the  administration  of  the  pollution  levy  fund,  to  make  more\ninvestment  funds  available  for  waste  minimization  technology  and  industrial  WWT  facilities.\nDuring  the  1990s,  the  prices  of  most  key  commodities  have  been  liberalized  to  reflect  market\nconditions, which provides better market-based incentives to conserve industrial inputs.\n\nUnder  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,  the  PRC  has  developed  an  umbrella  environmental\n18. \nprogram  with  a  target  year  of  2010.  This  program,  the  Transcentury  Green  Plan,  designates\nthree  river  basins  (Hai,  Huai,  and  Liao)  and  three  lakes  (Chao,  Dianchi,  and  Tai)  for  intense\nplanning and project implementation to alleviate serious environmental problems affecting water\nquality and the contiguous population.\n\n19. \nIn  response  to  the  required  action  for  the  Hai  River  Basin,  the  PRC  developed  the\nHRPPCP, which was approved by the State Council in March 1999. The HRPPCP designates\nTianjin as one of four major cities, along with Beijing, Shijiazhang, and Qinhuangdao, requiring\nurgent  intervention  in  pollution  control.  The  plan  requires  that  all  main  river  sections  in  Tianjin\nmeet their designated standard, and drinking water sources meet class III national standards for\ndrinking water sources.10 The PRC has recently designated Bohai Bay as a major water body\nrequiring national level intervention for cleanup.11\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nAddressing  urban  environmental  problems  and  improving  WWT  and  water  resources\n20. \nprotection  is  accorded  high  priority  in  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  operational  strategy.  ADB  has\nprovided  nine  loans,  totaling  more  than  $1  billion,  for  environmental  improvement,  wastewater\nmanagement, and water supply. ADB has provided three loans for water resource management\nand supply in Dalian City,12 Zhejiang Province,13 and Fuzhou City14 in Fujian Province. ADB has\nalso provided a loan to help reduce pollution and restore the water quality in Suzhou Creek and\nits  tributaries  in  Shanghai  City.15  Several  of  ADB\u2019s  urban  environment  projects  have  financed\nWWT  components  (e.g.,  Beijing,  Chengde,  Hefei,  Qingdao,  and  Tangshan).16  The  municipal\nWWT component of the Anhui Environmental Improvement Project17 is proceeding on schedule.\nInitial  concern  about  cost  recovery  has  been  mitigated  through  policy  dialogue  on  tariff\nincreases  and  the  introduction  of  commercial  management  principles.  These  measures  have\nhelped  to  demonstrate  that  such  projects  can  be  financially  viable  under  the  lending  terms  of\n\n                                                \n10 The class III standard is one of five classes. Class I, the highest standard, is for water supply sources with limited\ntreatment and national natural reserves; II and III are for fishing and recreation, and may be used as water supply\nsources  where  full  treatment  is  employed;  IV  is  suitable  for  industrial  uses  and  recreational  uses  not  involving\ncontact between the water and people\u2019s bodies; and V is for agricultural uses and scenic viewing.\n\n11 ADB  has  supported  environmental  improvement  in  Bohai  Bay  through  TA  2695-PRC:  Coastal  Resources\n\nConservation and Environmental Improvement, for $810,000, approved on 3 December 1996.\n12 Loan 1313-PRC: Dalian Water Supply Project, for $160 million, approved on 20 September 1994.\n13 Loan  1544-PRC: Zhejiang-Shanxi Water Supply Project (Phase I),  for  $100  million,  approved  on  24  September\n\n14 Loan  1636-PRC:  Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment  Project,  for  $102  million,  approved  on  30\n\n1997.\n\nSeptember 1998.\n\n15 Loan 1692-PRC: Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project, for $300 million, approved on 29 June 1999.\n16 Loan 1205-PRC: Qingdao Environmental Improvement Project, for $103 million, approved on 10 December 1992;\nLoan  1270-PRC:  Tangshan and Chengde Environmental Improvement Project,  for  $140  million,  approved  on  2\nNovember  1993; Loan  1336-PRC: Beijing Environmental Improvement Project,  for  $157  million,  approved  on  29\nNovember  1993;  and  Loan  1543-PRC: Xian-Xianyang-Tongchuan Environmental Improvement Project,  for  $156\nmillion, approved on 24 September 1997.\n\n17 Loans  1490  and  1491-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Municipal Wastewater Treatment and\n\nIndustrial Pollution Abatement, for $140 million, approved on 26 November 1996.\n\n\f6\n\nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. As a result, ADB\u2019s future PRC program includes an increasing\nnumber of projects in the wastewater and water resources sectors.\n\n21. \nSince 1989, ADB has financed 52 TA studies for $27 million to address issues relating to\nwater resource management, environment, and water supply. ADB has helped to strengthen the\nPRC\u2019s  policies  and  strategies  for  water  resources,  including  a  TA  that  assessed  the  strategic\noptions for the water sector.18 This study focused on the management of water resources from\nan entire river basin perspective, with emphasis on development of basic data, and identification\nof  pollution  and  erosion  control  measures,  as  well  as  methods  for  allocation  of  scarce  water\nresources. ADB has also supported specific water resource management and planning activities\nin  the  Beijing-Tianjin  area,  Dalian,  Hainan  Island,  and  the  Hai  River  Basin;  and  water  quality\nmanagement planning in Shanghai.19\n\nADB has supported the water supply tariff reform process through a recently completed\n22. \nstudy,  and  a  follow-on  study  currently  underway,  with  the  Ministry  of  Construction.20  The\ncompleted  study  found  that  the  average  cost  of  urban  water  production  has  increased  more\nthan  six-fold  during  the  past  decade  due  to  increasingly  poor  raw  water  quality,  higher\nproduction standards, and increases in the price of inputs. The study assisted the Government\nin developing the National Guidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT), focusing on improving the cost\nrecovery  performance  of  the  WSCs  and  promoting  water  conservation.  The  follow-on  study  is\nassisting  the  Government  in  developing  the  institutional  and  methodological  capacities  to\nimplement  the  NGWT  at  the  local  level,  and  to  promote  public  consultations  through  public\nhearings.  Recent  affordability  studies  indicate  that  the  proposed  higher  water  tariffs  remain\naffordable, particularly as real average incomes in the PRC have risen by 19 percent annually\nduring the 1990s. While affordability is generally not a problem in major cities and for the more\nprosperous east coast residents, it remains a concern in some of the poorer interior regions.\n\n23. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  PRC\u2019s  wastewater,  water  supply,  and  water  resources\nmanagement  sectors  has  resulted  in  more  rational  pricing  of  water,  major  increases  in  water\ntariffs,  introduction  of  wastewater  tariffs,  implementation  of  commercial  principles,  improved\nenvironmental  management  and  related \nformulation  of  effluent  standards  and\ndevelopment of regulatory aspects, and introduction of private sector participation. ADB is also\nassisting the Government to design and implement market-based instruments for water quality\nmanagement  and  establish  dynamic  water  quality  monitoring  capabilities.21  These  are\nfundamental improvements that will help make the water and wastewater sectors financially and\noperationally sustainable.\n\nfees, \n\n24. \nIn addition to ADB, the World Bank and a number of bilateral agencies have supported\nthe  urban  wastewater  and  water  resources  sectors  in  the  PRC.  The  World  Bank  has\nparticipated  in  19  urban,  environmental,  and  water  supply  projects.  The  $700  million  of  World\nBank assistance has generally been from International Development Association resources, and\nhas  been  combined  with  urban  development  and  environmental  improvement  programs.

The  World  Bank's\nwater resources projects have been concentrated in the Yellow River Basin.\n\n25. \nJapan,  through  its  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  is  the  largest\nbilateral  source  of  aid  to  the  PRC  and  is  mainly  involved  in  physical  infrastructure,  water\nresources  development,  and  environmental  improvement  projects.  Since  1989,  JBIC  has\nprovided loans on concessional terms for 11 urban water supply projects totaling $900 million,\nand  WWT  projects  on  the  Huao  and  Xiang  rivers  and  in  Mudanjiang.  In  March  1999,  JBIC\napproved  the  concept  for  preparation  of  an  urban  sewerage  treatment  project  in  five  cities  in\nZhejiang Province.\n\n26. \nBilateral  aid  agencies,  including  from  Australia,  Canada,  Finland,  France,  Germany,\nItaly,  Norway,  Sweden,  and  United  Kingdom,  are  also  involved  in  the  wastewater  and  water\nresources sectors, although on a smaller scale. Most bilateral assistance has been designed to\naddress  urban  environmental  problems  with  an  emphasis  on  wastewater  and  sewerage\ntreatment, and energy conservation.\n\n27. \nIn Tianjin, the World Bank has been involved in the water supply and sewerage sector.\nIn  1992,  the  World  Bank  financed  an  urban  development  and  environment  project,  which  was\nefficiently  implemented,  and  is  planning  a  related  second  project  in  2001.  The  second  project\nincludes  (i)  urban  transportation,  (ii)  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  and  (iii)  river\nrehabilitation. A World Bank loan for sewerage and drainage improvements in the middle portion\nof  the  Beicang  district  in  urban  Tianjin  is  also  under  consideration.  Facilities  include  storm\ndrains, sewers, and pump stations. The total investment cost is estimated at Y650 million.\n\nIn  Tianjin,  JBIC  financed  a  water  supply  expansion  project  in  1990  and  is  planning  to\n28. \nfinance sewage treatment projects under a fourth batch of loans to the PRC (1999-2000). The\nJBIC  Tianjin  Wastewater  Treatment  Project  has  tentative  JBIC  financing  of  Y7.2  billion.  Loan\nnegotiations  for  the  project  were  completed  in  October  2000.  The  components  include  (i)\nexpansion and rehabilitation of the Jizhuangzi WWT plant, (ii) construction of the new Xianyang\nRoad WWT plant, and (iii) drainage and sewage collection in the southeast suburbs.\n\n29. \nThese  projects  are  fully  complementary  and  supportive  to  the  proposed  Project.  There\nwas  close  coordination  between  ADB,  JBIC,  and  World  Bank  during  project  processing  to\nensure that their assistance in the water sector in Tianjin is complementary and that duplication\nand overlap are avoided.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n30. \nProjects  in  ADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio  have  generally  been  implemented  on  or  ahead  of\nschedule, and have performed well. This reflects a rigorous internal screening process, strong\nproject  ownership,  and  good  technical  capabilities  of  executing  agencies.  For  some  projects,\ndelays  have  occurred  in  loan  signing  and  effectiveness  as  well  as  in  procurement.  The\nGovernment  is  streamlining  the  multiple  approval  process  to  address  these  problems,  which\ntend to occur with weaker executing agencies.\n\nExperience  in  wastewater  and  water  resources  management  in  the  PRC,  although\n31. \nlimited,  indicates  that  projects  are  well  implemented  and  that  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  are\nincreased  as  required.  Willingness-to-pay  analysis  has  indicated  that  consumers  are  willing  to\npay  substantially  higher  prices  for  water,  and  to  a  certain  extent,  are  willing  to  pay  for  WWT.\nIssues  related  to  tariff  levels,  cost  recovery,  and  commercial  orientation  of  the  water  utilities\nneed  to  be  carefully  addressed  during  project  processing.  Under  the  WWT  component  of  the\nAnhui Environmental Improvement Project, tariffs were increased to levels commensurate with\n\n\f8\n\nfull  cost  recovery  of  O&M  costs.  Capital  costs  are  also  being  partially  recovered  through\nconnection  fees.  Under  the  Fuzhou  Water  Supply  and  Wastewater  Treatment  Project,\ncovenants  require  wastewater  tariffs  to  be  increased  to  cover  all  O&M  and  financial  costs\nassociated with treating wastewater by 2003.\n\nLessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  postevaluation  experience  in  wastewater,  water  supply,\n32. \nand  water  resources  management  in  the  Asian  and  Pacific  Region  indicate  that  both  supply-\nand demand-side concerns must be integrated into project designs. Encouraging broad reforms\nsuch  as  commercial  management  and  introducing  competition  will  promote  efficient  and\nresponsive  delivery  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  services.  Appropriate  pricing  policies  for\nwater  and  sanitation  services  are  also  required.  The  policy  agenda  for  water  supply  and\nwastewater  projects  in  the  PRC  has  centered  around  cost  recovery,  tariff  reform,  and  water\nresource and wastewater management.\n\n33. \nDuring project processing, lessons of experience have been addressed by (i) thoroughly\nevaluating the technical designs and technologies; (ii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for\nTianjin  Sewerage  Company  (TSC)  and  the  Tianjin  Municipal  Luanhe  Drinking  Water  Source\nProtection  Engineering  Ltd  (TML);  (iii)  undertaking  rigorous  sensitivity  analysis  of  cash  flows,\nand  financial  and  economic  analysis;  (iv)  incorporating  institutional  strengthening  measures  to\nimprove  the  level  of  corporate  governance;  and  (v)  securing  autonomy  in  operations  and  for\nprocurement decisions by TSC and TML.\n\nE.\n\nADB's Country and Sectoral Strategy\n\n34. \nADB\u2019s three strategic objectives for the PRC are to (i) improve economic efficiency, (ii)\npromote  growth  to  reduce  poverty  in  poor  interior  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhance  environmental\nprotection and natural resource management. Improving water supply and sanitation facilities is\nimportant  to  enhance  the  living  standards  and  productivity  of  urban  populations,  arrest\nenvironmental  degradation,  and  sustain  levels  of  economic  growth.  Developing  efficient  water\nsupply  systems,  including  the  treatment  and  distribution  of  raw  water  and  the  treatment  and\ndisposal  of  wastewater,  will  require  substantial  investments  in  both  physical  infrastructure  and\nhuman resource development. ADB is pursuing priority projects for urban wastewater, sewage\ntreatment,  water  supply,  and  water  resources  management.  Because  of  the  need  to  achieve\ncost  recovery,  the  country  operational  strategy  provides  for  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  highly\nurbanized  areas  in  the  eastern  coastal  areas  where  urban  environmental  problems  are  acute\nand income levels are high enough to make the related tariffs affordable. Project preparatory TA\nis used to prepare, formulate, and process urban infrastructure projects in cities with the most\nurgent requirements. Policy-support TA is provided to strengthen the management and financial\ncapabilities  of  the  agencies  involved  in  the  lending  program,  to  develop  reforms  for  improving\ncost recovery and financial management of water supply and wastewater, and to help prioritize\ninvestments in water supply.\n\nIn the water sector, ADB is focusing on (i) improving the efficiency of water supply and\n35. \ndistribution  systems  through  investment  in  physical  infrastructure,  (ii)  promoting  improved\ncorporate governance and commercial management to enhance the potential for future private\nsector involvement, (iii) improving cost recovery by strengthening tariff systems and structures\nfor  raw  and  treated  water,  and  (iv)  ensuring  water  resources  conservation  and  environmental\nprotection through the continuing support of legislative and regulatory provisions.\n\n36. \nOne of ADB's strategic objectives in its PRC operations is to help improve environmental\nand  natural  resource  management.  During  the  1998  ADB  Country  Programming  Mission,  the\nPRC  requested  advisory  TA  to  prepare  a  strategic  plan  for  wastewater  management  and\n\n\f9\n\npollution  control  for  the  Hai  River  Basin.22  The  TA  was  completed  in  January  2000.  In  1999,\nduring the midterm review of the ADB country assistance plan, the PRC reconfirmed an earlier\nrequest  for  TA  for  a  Tianjin  WWT  and  water  resources  protection  project.  Subsequently,  ADB\napproved  a  project  preparatory  TA.  The  proposed  Project  is  one  of  the  first  initiatives  being\nsupported  by  ADB  within  the  context  of  the  Hai  River  Basin  program  of  environmental\nimprovement, and is consistent with the ADB strategy.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nADB's  agenda  for  policy  dialogue  in  the  wastewater  and  water  resources  sectors  is\n37. \nbeing  pursued  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform;  (ii)  watershed\nmanagement; (iii) upstream pollution prevention and control; (iv) market-based instruments for\nwastewater  management,  including  tradable  permits  and  the  pollution  levy  system;  (v)  clean\nproduction  technologies;  (vi)  regulatory  enforcement  and  monitoring;  (vii)  water  conservation;\n(viii) corporate governance and enterprise reform; (ix) wastewater management; and (x) private\nsector participation.\n\n1.\n\nCost Recovery and Tariff Reform\n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and  enterprise  reform\nprograms  that  require  that  all  wastewater  and  water  supply  projects  be  financially  sustainable\nand capable of cost recovery. The Government's policy guidance on setting of wastewater tariffs\nhas  recently  been  amended  by  Circular  No.  1192,  issued  jointly  in  September  1999  by  State\nDevelopment  Planning  Commission  (SDPC),  MOC,  and  SEPA.  The  circular  provides  that\nwastewater tariffs be set on the basis of full cost recovery principles and requests urgent action\nby  the  end  of  1999  to  implement  the  circular  in  priority  areas  of  \"the  three  lakes  and  three\nrivers.\" Tianjin is in one of those priority areas, being part of the Hai River Basin.\n\nADB\u2019s Water Tariff Study23 supported the Government\u2019s initiatives by assisting with the\n39. \ndevelopment of national guidelines for appropriate water tariff mechanisms at the national level,\nincluding the NGWT. The NGWT were promulgated by the SDPC and MOC in September 1999,\nand will become fully operational over the next two years. In accordance with these regulations,\nand  as  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  Tianjin  City  has  increased  its  water  and  wastewater\ntariffs effective 1 November 1999 by 62 percent. The average retail water tariff in the city is now\nY1.40/cubic  meter  (m3)  compared  with  the  Y1.1/m3  average  in  1998,  and  the  average\nwastewater tariff is now Y0.35/m3 compared with the Y0.27/m3 average in 1998. The retail water\ntariffs include a raw water fee. The WWT fee is included on water supply bills as a separate and\nadditional item, or is billed separately by TSC where municipal water supply is not provided. The\nproceeds  from  these  fees  are  administered  by  Tianjin  Water  Supply  Company  and  TSC,  and\nused solely for providing water and wastewater services and infrastructure.\n\n40. \nBased on a financial assessment of the WWT component, the domestic wastewater tariff\nrates  required  by  TSC  will  need  to  increase  from  the  current  rate  of  Y0.2/m3  to  Y0.6/m3  in  by\n2003 and to Y1.20/m3 by 2005, and remain constant in real terms thereafter. Industrial and other\ntariff user rates will need to increase from the current rate of Y0.4/m3 to Y0.8/m3 in 2003 and to\nY1.2/m3  in  2005  and  stay  constant  in  real  terms  thereafter.  These  prices  will  ensure  full  cost\nrecovery for TSC including its operating and investment costs and provide a reasonable profit.\n\n41. \nTianjn  Municipal  Government  (TMG)  plans  to  continue  to  subsidize  stormwater\noperations at Y34 million per annum, remaining constant in real terms. This subsidy recognizes\n                                                \n22 TA 3095-PRC: Hai River Basin Wastewater Management and Pollution Control Project, for $570,000, approved on\n\n10 November 1998.\n\n23 TA3250-PRC: Water Tariff Study II, for $950,000, approved on 3 September 1999.\n\n\f10\n\nthe natural public good this service provides, and is consistent with ADB policy. TMG will cease\nthe sewerage subsidy, currently at Y5.6 million. TMG will reduce the sewage treatment subsidy,\ncurrently  at  Y75  million,  by  50  percent,  and  by  2003  eliminate  the  subsidy  altogether.  The\nphasing out of these subsidies is consistent with both Government and ADB policy.\n\nBased on a financial assessment of the WRP component, the required wholesale prices\n42. \nfor raw water to be sold by TML to the Tianjin WSCs need to increase from the current rate of\nY0.40/m3  to  Y0.65/m3  in  2003  and  Y0.85/m3  in  2005,  and  remain  constant  in  real  terms\nthereafter.  Raw  water  tariffs  to  industries  that  recycle  water  will  need  to  increase  from  the\ncurrent rate of Y0.13/m3 to Y0.22/m3 in 2003 and Y0.28/m3 in 2005, and remain constant in real\nterms thereafter. These prices will ensure full cost recovery for TML including its operating and\ninvestment costs and provide a reasonable profit. In addition, TMG will fund the estimated Y47m\ncash shortfall in 2001.\n\n43. \nAn  affordability  analysis  for  2005  estimates  that  the  combined  retail  water  bill  for  raw\nwater,  wastewater,  and  an  incremental  tap  water  charge  will  be  affordable.  For  the  mean\nincome  household,  the  monthly  combined  bill  is  Y32,  around  1.5  percent  of  income.  For  the\npoorest 5 percent of households, the monthly combined water bill is Y35, around 4.5 percent of\nincome. The affordability analysis is given as Appendix 2.\n\n2.\n\nComprehensive Watershed Management\n\n44.  Water  quality  in  the  Luan  River  to  the  Tianjin  diversion  channel  has  deteriorated  in\nrecent  years  and  needs  to  be  restored  to  ensure  that  drinking  water  quality  in  Tianjin\nconsistently  meets  national  standards.  The  flood  control,  river  flow  augmentation,  and\nagricultural  irrigation  roles  of  the  diversion  compete  with  the  drinking  water  supply  needs.\nDiscussions  have  been  undertaken  with  the  Tianjin  Water  Conservancy  Bureau,  and  the\nbureau\u2019s  unit  that  is  to  become  the  new  TML,  on  watershed  management  practices  based  on\nthe  best-known  international  practices.  TML  expressed  strong  interest  in  strengthening\ncomprehensive watershed management. Training in watershed management is included in the\nimplementation package of the proposed loan.\n\n3.\n\nUpstream Pollution Prevention and Control\n\nThe  policy  dialogue  on  environmental  policy  and  upstream  pollution  issues  is  directly\n45. \nrelated to watershed management. During project processing, discussions were focused on the\neffect of total pollution loads, particularly total phosphorus from upstream sources not under the\ncontrol of Tianjin. Following completion of the ADB-funded HRPPCP, TMG completed a study in\nAugust  1999  entitled  the  \"Integrated  Pollution  Control  Program  for  Yuqiao  Reservoir.\"  The\nreport  addresses  existing  pollution  loading  and  estimates  the  likely  results  of  corrective  and\npreventive actions. Specifically, the report points out that 53.5 percent of total phosphorus, the\ncritical nutrient in reservoir eutrophication, comes from the upstream flows from the Zunhua City\narea of Hebei Province and two major fertilizer plants.\n\n46. \nImplementation of the relevant HRPPCP pollution abatement measures, as reinforced in\nthe final report of ADB-funded TA 3095 (footnote 22), the Hai River Basin study, are seen as a\nhigh  priority  by  the  Government.  TMG  interagency  cooperation  and  cross-jurisdictional\nprograms are vital elements, and several mechanisms are in place. TMG and Hebei provincial\ngovernment  have  held  a  number  of  meetings  to  address  cooperation,  and  the  dialogue  is\nexpected  to  be  advanced  by  the  Hai  River  Basin  Commission.  TMG  and  Zunhua  City  are\nexploring  the  idea  of  setting  up  a  jointly-financed  environmental  fund  for  industrial  WWT  in\nZunhua City. The 2000 country assistance plan includes assistance from ADB to address trans-\n\n\f11\n\njurisdictional  pollution  at  a  policy  level.24  In  support  of  the  comprehensive  Hai  River  Basin\nprogram, the country assistance plan includes a $100 million Hebei Hai and Luan wastewater\nproject in its 2002 pipeline. Together with the proposed Project, these interventions can ensure\nan  integrated,  coordinated  response  to  pollution  prevention  and  control.  In  addition,  further\nstudies  recommended  under  Hai  River  Basin  study  would  strengthen  regulatory  and  legal\nframeworks guiding environmental standards development, penalty and incentive mechanisms,\ncross-border dispute settlement, and harmonize institutional inspection mechanisms.\n\n4.\n\nWastewater Management\n\n47. \nADB has supported the Government\u2019s policies for wastewater management by providing\na  number  of  related  environmental  loans  that  included  WWT  components  in  Beijing,  Chaohu,\nChengde, Fuzhou, Hefei, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Tangshan. The importance of WWT was also\naddressed  under  the  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Planning  TA25  that  strengthened\ninstitutions  responsible  for  environmental  improvement  in  a  number  of  cities,  and  identified\nfuture infrastructure requirements.\n\nThe urban area of Tianjin is very densely developed, with a typical density of 600 people\n48. \nper  hectare  in  residential  areas.  Urban  housing  has  been  carefully  controlled  and  planned,\nincluding  the  provision  of  septic  tanks  in  large  apartment  buildings  and  separation  of  sewage\nfrom  storm  water.  Total  wastewater  flows  are  1.4  million  m3/day,  with  industrial  wastewater\naccounting  for  more  than  half  of  the  total.  The  existing  wastewater  collection  and  transfer\nsystem  in  the  project  area  is  inadequate.  There  are  no  WWT  plants  in  the  Beicang  area.  The\nexisting Jizhuangzi WWT plant is overloaded and slated for extension, and a new plant is to be\nbuilt at Xian Yang Road by the end of 2003. Only 47 percent of wastewater flows are treated,\nand downstream sections of the rivers, waterways, and canals are heavily polluted mainly due\nto untreated wastewater discharge. Accordingly, wastewater management was a key aspect of\npolicy dialogue during project processing.\n\nTMG has prepared wastewater master plans, including sewers, interceptors, and WWT\n49. \nplants. The six urban sewerage districts of Tianjin already contain sewers serving a substantial\nportion  of  existing  development.  The  primary  focus  of  the  current  wastewater  programs  is  on\nproviding  adequate  treatment  capacity  and  the  trunk  mains  necessary  to  convey  flows  to  the\nplants  from  the  present  points  of  discharge.  The  current  plans  for  wastewater  collection  and\ntreatment facilities provide for extensive coverage by 2010.\n\n50. \nTo promote the reuse of treated sewage, TMG has approved two pilot programs to reuse\ntreated wastewater from WWT plants in Dagang and Ziezhuangzi. Wastewater will be treated to\nmeet  standards  for  household  uses,  such  as  sanitation  and  gardening.  A  separate  pipeline\nsystem will be constructed for each system. A preliminary estimate shows that the retail water\ntariff  in  the  two  towns  will  be  lower  than  in  other  areas,  which  could  provide  an  incentive  for\nwider acceptance at the wastewater reuse concept.\n\n5.\n\nMarket-Based instruments\n\n51. \nGovernment  policies  have  shifted  out  of  command  and  control  approaches  and  the\nintroduction of market-based instruments (MBIs). ADB is taking a lead role in helping to design\na water pollution trading system by actively supporting pilot projects in Fuzhou and Shanghai.\n\n                                                \n24 PRC:  TA Cluster for Trans-Jurisdiction Environmental Management,  for  $2.2  million,  comprising  of  TAs  for  (i)\nlegislation and institutions, (ii) planning tools and methodologies, (iii) transcentury green program, and (iv) Yellow\nRiver pollution control. The cluster will be phased in a period of three years (2001-2003).\n\n25 TA 2015-PRC: Urban Environmental Improvement Planning, for $480,000, approved on 14 December 1993.\n\n\f12\n\nUse of MBIs can improve economic efficiency of wastewater management, and lower the costs\nof  pollution  reduction.  During  project  processing,  TMG\u2019s  plans  and  programs  to  address  the\npollution in the existing canals and inland waterways (the Hai River system) were assessed, and\nthe potential for use of MBI technologies for better environmental management was reviewed. A\nprerequisite for the use of MBIs is administrative control over an entire river basin and its total\npollution load, which is not the case for the Hai River in TMG.\n\n52. \nDuring  project  processing,  considerable  scope  was  found  for  the  development  of  a\npollution  levy  system  as  a  charge  related  to  marginal  abatement  and  damage  costs.  Such  a\ndevelopment  could  achieve  least-cost  benefits  equal  to  or  higher  than  the  use  of  tradable\npermits, in this project-specific instance and without the need for large-scale legal or institutional\nchanges and probable high transaction costs associated with tradeable permits. TMG and the\nTianjin  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  (TEPB)  are  focusing  on  creating  an  enabling\nenvironment  for  MBIs  by  establishing  total  maximum  allowable  pollution  loads  to  reach  the\ndesired  ambient  water  quality  and  strengthening  monitoring  and  enforcement.  During  project\nimplementation, knowledge gained about MBIs in other ADB TAs will be shared with Tianjin.26\n\nIn  the  project  area,  MBIs  are  increasingly  being  used  for  industrial  water  conservation.\n53. \nThe  Tianjin  Water  Savings  Office  coordinates  water  conservation  efforts.  The  water\nconsumption  plan  identifies  the  optimal  consumption  of  industries.  Industrial  water  use  is\nregularly  surveyed  to  determine  whether  firms  exceed  this  optimal  use.  The  office  has  a\npublicity  campaign  targeted  to  domestic  water  users  to  promote  conservation.  As  a  result  of\npolicy  dialogue  during  project  processing,  water  tariffs  were  revised  to  promote  water\nconservation  and  effective  demand-side  management.  Setting  water  tariffs  at  rates  that\nencourage  water  conservation  is  an  effective  market-based  environmental  management  tool\nthat can cover domestic and industrial discharges at low administrative cost.\n\n6.\n\nClean Production Technologies\n\nPolicies for the introduction of clean technology are closely related to the broader reform\n54. \nof  industry  and  the  program  of  industrial  restructuring  and  modernization  currently  being\nimplemented by the Government. ADB is supporting the promotion of clean technology through\na TA cluster of six subprojects.27 TMG is giving high priority to cleaning up the polluted inland\nwaterways  by  providing  assistance  to  increase  the  efficiencies  of  industrial  WWT  through\nimplementing process audits, adopting recommendations on clean technology, providing advice\non  pretreatment  systems,  and  making  funds  available  from  the  pollution  levy  fund.  TMG,\nthrough  TEPB,  has  made  substantial  progress  in  implementing  measures  to  ensure  full\ncompliance  with  industrial  discharge  standards.  Ambitious  targets  that  exceed  government\nguidelines  that  are  being  met  by  TMG.  Industrial  pollution  control  projects  under  way  in  TMG\nuse  clean  technology  as  well  as  traditional  \"end-of-pipe\"  solutions.  In  addition,  a  specific\nindustrial pollution control revolving fund has been established under the World Bank-supported\nTianjin Environmental Project (Phase I).\n\n                                                \n26 TA 2951-PRC: Promotion of Market-Based Instruments in Environmental Management, for $697,0000, approved\non 16 December 1997; TA 3013-THA: Promotion of Market-Based Instruments in Environmental Management, for\n$605,000, approved on 5 May 1998; and TA 3211-PRC (footnote 21).\n\n27 TA 3079-PRC: Promotion of Clean Technology, for $3,500,000, approved on 29 September 1998. The TA cluster\nconsists  of  (i)  policies  for  promotion  of  clean  technology;  (ii)  national  network  for  clean  technology  transfer;  (iii)\nlegislative  support  for  clean  technology;  (iv)  clean  technology  development;  (v)  environmental  management  for\nclean technologies in TVEs; and (vi) financing mechanisms for clean technologies in TVEs.\n\n\f13\n\n7.\n\nRegulatory Enforcement and Monitoring for Environmental Management\n\n55. \nAttention  to  sound  environmental  management,  including  natural  resources  and  water\nconservation,  is  a  comparatively  recent  concern  in  the  PRC.  To  help  build  the  necessary\ncapacity  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework,  ADB  supported  the  training  of  staff  of  the\nEnvironment  Protection  Commission  of  the  National  People\u2019s  Congress  and  the  drafting  and\nrevising  some  of  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  laws.28  ADB  is  also  helping  to  upgrade  the\nknowledge and skills of provincial legislative drafters in the review, amendment, and formulation\nof  local  legislation  related  to  the  protection  and  conservation  of  the  environment  and  natural\nresources.29 ADB is supporting improved environmental management through (i) an analysis of\nthe  most  suitable  market-based  instruments;  and  (ii)  the  formulation  of  a  program  for  their\nadoption, specifically in the water and energy sectors.30 In addition, ADB provided assistance in\nenvironmental management by improving the institutional capacity of SEPA, and the local and\nprovincial  environmental  protection  bureaus  to  strengthen  environmental  standards  and  to\nenforce environmental laws and policies.31 The PRC\u2019s environmental standards are not similar\nto international practice. The major issue is now compliance and enforcement.\n\nIn May 1996, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the 1984 Water Pollution Law to\n56. \naddress many of the weaknesses of the old law, and reflect the revisions to the Water Pollution\nPrevention and Control Law recommended under TA 2090-PRC (footnote 28). Also in 1996, the\nState Council approved the Ninth Five-Year Plan for Environmental Protection for 2010 with two\nsupplemental documents: the \u201cTotal Emission Quantity Control Plan for Major Pollutants.\u201d and\nthe \u201cTranscentury Green Plan.\u201d\n\n8.\n\nWater Conservation\n\n57. \nThe  issue  of  water  conservation  has  been  an  important  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  and\nADB\u2019s  agenda  in  the  PRC  water  sector.  The  water  conservation  policies  that  have  been\npursued  in  conjunction  with  the  Project  include  ensuring  that  system  losses  are  minimized\nthrough  efficient  commercial  operations,  improved  lining  of  water  delivery  channels,  leakage\ndetection,  and  repair;32  and  providing  market-based  incentives  to  reduce  water  use  through\nadequate  pricing  of  water  and  wastewater  tariffs.  Water  conservation  policies  have  been\naddressed  by  the  Project  through  the  adoption  of  adequate  pricing  of  water  and  promoting\ncommercial operations.\n\n58. \nTMG  promulgated  the  Tianjin  City  Water  Conservation  Rules  in  1986,  which  were\namended in 1997. The Tianjin Water Savings Office implemented the rules, and is responsible\nfor  policy,  planning,  training,  and  public  awareness.  The  office  develops  a  water  savings  plan\neach  year,  which  includes  indicators  to  evaluate  performance.  Nonresidential  water  use\nexceeding  the  assigned  quota  is  surcharged  up  to  10  times  the  regular  tariff.  To  avoid  water\nlosses, the Tianjin Engineering and Construction Bureau has undertaken leakage detection. A\n                                                \n28 TA 2090-PRC: Legislative Planning and Procedures for the Protection of the Environment, for $393,000, approved\non 26 April 1994; and TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for National Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved\non 24 December 1996.\n\n29 TA  3123-PRC:  Provincial  Legislation  on  Environmental  Protection  and  Natural  Resources  Conservation,  for\n\n$300,000, approved on 15 December 1998.\n\n30 TA  2951-PRC: Promotion of Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management,  for  $697,000,  approved\n\n31 TA 2505-PRC: Strengthening the Environmental Standards and Enforcement Policies, for $600,000, approved on\n\non 16 December 1997.\n\n22 December 1995.\n\n32 ADB  supported  this  policy  on  a  regional  basis,  covering  PRC  as  well  as  other  countries,  through  TA  5725-REG:\nRegional Training Course on Reducing Distribution System Water Losses in Developing Member Countries,  for\n$75,000, approved on 17 February 1997. The TA scope covers the PRC.\n\n\f14\n\nleakage detection workforce examines all water supply mains in the city, which has reduced the\noverall level of water losses from about 18 percent in 1998 to 13 percent in March 2000.\n\n9.\n\nCorporate Governance and Enterprise Reform\n\nPolicy  dialogue  during  project  processing  addressed  four  aspects  of  corporate\n59. \ngovernance and enterprise reform: (i) structuring TSC and the TML along commercial lines, (ii)\npreparing  a  business  plan,  (iii)  strengthening  the  operations  of  the  boards  of  directors  for  the\ncompanies,  and  (iv)  implementing  external  and  internal  audit  arrangements.  The  Project's\ncomponent  for  WWT  will  be  constructed,  owned,  and  managed  by  TSC,  a  registered,  limited\nliability  company.  This  is  in  accordance  with  State  Government  Circular  No.  1192,  which\nidentified  the  establishment  of  enterprise  companies  as  the  preferred  institutional  model  for\nmanaging  wastewater  services.  For  the  Project's  water  resources  protection  components,  the\nfacilities will be constructed, owned, and managed by TML, a newly registered, limited liability\ncompany. Both companies will be responsible for their financial management and performance,\nand governed by a board of directors representing the shareholders. The board of directors will\nbe  responsible  for  overseeing  financial  and  operational  matters  including  (i)  hiring  and  firing\nsenior management, (ii) reviewing staffing and remuneration plans, (iii) reviewing the progress\nof  construction  and  approving  annual  construction  plans,  (iv)  reviewing  and  approving  annual\nbudgets,  and  (v)  approving  procurement  of  major  equipment  and  civil  works  contracts.  Under\nthe loan, consulting assistance will be provided to develop the capacity of the companies in the\nareas of accounting, financial management, environmental and social monitoring capability, and\noperations and management.\n\n10.\n\nPrivate Sector Participation\n\n60. \nADB has played a leading role in introducing BOT in the PRC\u2019s water supply sector by\nsponsoring  a  conference33  and  structuring  transparent,  competitive  bidding  for  the  Chengdu\nBOT project,34 the first such project in the PRC. During project processing, the main features of\nthe Chengdu BOT35 project were discussed with TMG, which expressed interest in this modality\nof  private  sector  involvement  for  future  investments.  Other  modalities  for  private  sector\nparticipation include leasing contracts and joint ventures.36 While private sector involvement for\nthe  raw  water  supply  and  WWT  components  will  not  take  place  at  this  time,  the  Project  will\ncreate  the  environment  necessary  for  future  participation  by  the  private  sector  by  pursuing  a\nreform agenda on tariffs, the principle of full cost recovery, and corporatization (restructuring the\ngovernment  entities  as  corporations),  the  necessary  prerequisites  for  such  private  sector\ninvolvement.37  As  the  WWT  component  is  part  of  a  comprehensive  wastewater  system\ncomposed  of  multiple  treatment  plants  in  six  sewerage  districts,  the  opportunity  for  private\nsector  involvement  is  limited  at  this  time.  Nevertheless,  TMG  expressed  interest  in  inviting\nprivate sponsors using other private sector participation modalities for future projects.\n\n                                                \n33 TA 2504-PRC: Seminar on BOT in the Water Supply Sector, for $100,000, approved on 22 December 1995.\n34 TA 2804-PRC: Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Chengdu Water Supply, for $600,000, approved on 2 June 1997.\n35 Loan 1669-PRC: The Chengdu Generale des Eaux-Marubeni Project, for $26.5 million, approved on 11 February\n\n1999.\n\n36 The positive financial performance of joint venture water bottling enterprises in Indonesia was cited as an example\n\nof successful private sector participation.\n\n37 ADB has supported private sector participation in the PRC water supply sector through TA 2504-PRC and 2804-\n\nPRC (footnotes 33 and 34).\n\n\f15\n\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n61. \nThe vision of Tianjin is to advance toward becoming a modern, flourishing, prosperous,\nand beautiful industrial metropolis. A major thrust of urban planning and development in Tianjin\nhas been to improve the densely-settled urban environment in the city center. This has included\nrelocating industry, promoting new industrial developments, and encouraging the development\nof  clean  and  high-technology  industry.  The  city  has  been  successful  in  managing  rapid\ndevelopment,  with  a  doubling  and  tripling  of  various  economic  and  industrial  sectors  during\n1993-1997. Continued economic growth is crucial to poverty alleviation within the city. Improved\nwastewater management  and  environmental protection of the city's sole raw water source are\nessential  for  rapid  economic  growth  to  continue  and  to  be  sustainable.  The  Project  comprises\ntwo components that support these goals\u2014wastewater collection and treatment in the Beicang\narea  of  Tianjin  and  water  resources  protection  (WRP)  for  the  Luan-Tianjin  water  diversion\nsystem.  Both  components  are  identified  as  high  priority  interventions  within  the  HRPPCP  and\nwill facilitate the sustainable economic development of urban Tianjin.\n\n62.  Wastewater  collection  and  treatment  projects  in  general,  and  the  Beicang  WWT\ncomponent  in  particular,  are  important  to  Tianjin  for  three  reasons:  (i)  within  the  local\nwastewater service areas, improved wastewater services will enhance urban environmental and\npublic  health  conditions;  (ii)  the  Hai  River  Basin  is  highly  polluted  by  upstream  sources  and\ndrains through Tianjin; the city must shoulder its responsibilities in wastewater management to\nencourage and demand improved wastewater management by the upstream polluters, located\nprimarily in Hebei Province and in Beijing; and (iii) in coordination with other externally-funded\nwastewater  projects,  the  WWT  component  will  contribute  to  a  comprehensive  wastewater\nmanagement program and achievement of environmental benefits to the densely developed city\ncenter area. Implementation of the wastewater management program will also help mitigate the\npollution  loading  in  Bohai  Bay,  a  key  marine  and  fisheries  resource  that  increasingly  suffers\nfrom red tide and other detrimental effects of untreated wastewater effluent.\n\n63. \nAll  of  the  major  urban  areas  of  Tianjin  are  served  almost  exclusively  by  a  single  raw\nwater  supply  source,  the  Luan-Tianjin  water  diversion  system.  The  5  million  people  served  by\nthis system are currently at risk from pollution arising at various locations: within the Luan and Li\nriver basins in Hebei Province, and within the Zhou River watershed downstream from Yuqiao\nReservoir.  The  existing  problems  have  highlighted  the  risk  to  Tianjin's  image  as  a  modern\nthriving  metropolis  that  can  effectively  manage  its  water  supply  system  and  provide  a  safe,\nclean water supply. The WRP component will eliminate the sources of pollution to the raw water\nsystem  that  are  within  Tianjin's  control,  and  lend  credibility  to  Tianjin's  demands  for  pollution\ncontrol of the upstream pollution sources in Hebei Province.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n64. \nThe  main  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  improve  the  urban  environment,  by  reducing\nenvironmental contamination through improved wastewater management, and the quality of raw\nwater  supply  in  Tianjin  City.  Related  objectives  include  (i)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the\nwastewater and raw water supply operations to be more efficient and managed on commercial\nprinciples;  (ii)  introducing  comprehensive  approaches  to  watershed  management;  and  (iii)\nimproving cost recovery from users through an improved tariff structure, with gradual increases\nto achieve full cost recovery.\n\n65. \nThe  Project  has  two  parts.  Part  A  (WWT)  consists  of  wastewater  collection  and\ntreatment,  and  Part  B  (WRP)  consists  of  protecting  the  raw  water  supply  for  the  Tianjin  City\n\n\f16\n\ncenter suburbs and coastal districts. The objectives of the WWT component are to (i) provide for\nWWT  in  a  service  area  that  currently  discharges  raw  sewage  to  surface  waters  (over  50,000\ncubic  meters  [m3]/day),  and  for  future  customers  who  will  be  connected  to  existing  and  new\nsewers;  (ii)  adhere  to  the  HRPPCP,  which  requires  implementation  of  WWT  construction\nprojects  by  31  December  2000;  and  (iii)  help  improve  the  Yongdingxin  River  water  quality  to\nmeet  a  minimum  class  V  (footnote  10)  standard  required  by  government  regulation.  The\nobjectives of the WRP component are to (i) provide increased protection from pollution for the\nraw water supply for approximately 5 million people in urban and coastal Tianjin; and (ii) provide\nmeans  for  the  raw  water  quality  to  meet  class  III  standard,  as  required  by  government\nregulation. Resettlement impacts addressed under the Project include physical relocation of 12\nhouseholds,  permanent  land  acquisition  affecting  900  households,  and  temporary  land\nacquisition affecting 1,591 households.\n\n1.\n\nPart A: Wastewater Collection and Treatment Component\n\n66. \nThe WWT component will provide wastewater facilities within the Beicang service area\nof  urban  Tianjin.  The  component  will  provide  trunk  sewers  and  four  sewage  pump  stations  to\nserve the newly-developing portion of Beicang, and a WWT plant to serve the eastern portion\nand  the  existing  sewered  area  in  the  central  portion  of  Beicang.  The  facilities  include  (i)  15.2\nkilometers  (km)  of  sewer  mains,  300  millimeters  (mm)  to  1500  mm  in  diameter;  (ii)  0.8  km  of\neffluent  mains,  1800  mm  diameter;  (iii)  four  pump  stations,  ranging  in  capacity  from  6,000  to\n15,000 m3/d, and pumping heads ranging from 6 to 12 meters (m); and (iv) the Phase I Beicang\nWWT plant of 100,000 m3/day capacity to handle the projected flows in 2010, expandable in the\nfuture to 250,000 m3/day, and using an \u201cA/O\u201d biological treatment process. The \u201cA/O\u201d process\nuses a combination of anaerobic and oxic conditions to reduce pollutants and phosphorous in\nthe wastewater.\n\n2.\n\nPart B: Water Resources Protection Component\n\nThe existing Luan-Tianjin water diversion system is the source of potable water for the\n67. \nTianjin central urban area containing 4 million people. It also provides raw water to six coastal\nand suburban water supply systems and to industries along the Hai River near the city center.\nThe  existing  system  stretches  234  km  from  the  Panda  reservoirs  on  the  Luan  River  in  Hebei\nProvince to the Xiankai River Waterworks, one of the three large water treatment plants within\nurban  Tianjin.  The  existing  raw  water  system  was  developed  in  response  to  severe  water\nshortages and deteriorated water quality in the Tianjin urban water supply system.\n\nThe  WRP  component  encompasses  three  major  elements  of  the  Luan-Tianjin  water\n68. \ndiversion project: (i) improvements to reduce water pollution within the Yuqiao Reservoir; (ii) a\nnew  closed  pressurized  box  culvert  to  carry  raw  water  from  Yuqiao  Reservoir  to  the\nJiuwangzhuang  Gate  to  avoid  pollution  of  the  water  from  the  Zhou  River  and  reduce  water\nlosses; and (iii) improvements to the existing open channel from the Jiuwangzhuang Gate to the\nDazhangzhuang Pump Station.\n\n69.  Water  quality  in  the  Yuqiao  Reservoir  will  be  protected  and  improved  by  (i)  planting  of\nappropriate  vegetation  within  various  ranges  of  ground  elevation;  (ii)  improvements  or\nrestrictions  in  land  use  within  a  strip  of  land  along  the  edge  of  the  reservoir,  extending  51  km\nalong the lakeside with an area of 36 square kilometers (km2); (iii) construction of low dams on\nsmall  tributaries  to  retard  soil  erosion  and  reduce  flow  velocities  that  can  carry  polluting\nsubstances  into  the  reservoir;  (iv)  wastewater  conveyance  and  treatment  systems  (by  open\nchannels  and  stabilization  ponds)  for  rural  villages,  coupled  with  improvements  in  wastewater\npretreatment  in  hospitals  and  enterprises,  and  improvements  in  the  handling  and  treatment  of\nnightsoil,  manure,  and  solid  wastes;  (v)  elimination  of  730  hectares  (ha)  of  fishponds  in  the\n\n\f17\n\nreservoir  and  below  a  ground  elevation  of  22  m;  and  (vi)  improvement  of  fish  ponds  behind  a\nprotective dike within the reservoir.\n\n70. \nThe  new  Zhou  River  channel  sections  will  consist  of  pressurized,  reinforced  concrete\nculverts.  Additional  siphons  and  channels  will  be  required  to  divert  drainage  and  flood  flows\nabove or under the box culvert. A diversion gate will be installed at Yuqiao Reservoir, to divert\nflows to the new closed culvert, and a siphon will be installed under the spillway channel.\n\n71. \nImprovements to the existing open channel will consist primarily of installing a lining on\nthe  side  slopes  and  bottom  of  the  channel,  and  will  involve  repair  of  existing  sections  having\nmortared  stone  lining,  or  installation  of  precast  concrete  panels.  Other  measures  include\nremoval  of  sediment  from  the  channel  bottom;  repair  of  leaking  siphons;  rebuilding  of  leaking\ngates  at  two  locations;  and  provision  of  a  patrol  road,  buffer  strip,  and  fences  to  isolate  the\nchannel from adjacent towns and highways.\n\n72. \nThe WRP component also addresses comprehensive watershed management within the\nTianjin portion of the Yuqiao Reservoir watershed. The Luan-Tianjin diversion channels extend\nabout 100 km from the Yuqiao Reservoir to Tianjin's urban areas, a distance that is too long to\nadequately police and control to prevent pollution and water theft. Further, Jixian County, which\ncovers  both  the  Yuqiao  and  Zhou  River  watersheds,  continues  to  develop  its  agricultural  and\nindustrial  base,  yet  lags  far  behind  in  terms  of  industrial  and  municipal  wastewater\nmanagement. The improvements, including watershed protection within Yuqiao Reservoir and a\nclosed  box  culvert  for  the  34  km  section  downstream  of  the  reservoir,  will  reduce  the  future\npollution risks to a more manageable level.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n73. \nUnder Part A of  the Project, the Beicang WWT plant, pumping stations, and sewers fit\ninto an overall wastewater system improvement and expansion program to be partially funded\nby  external  assistance  agencies.  The  component  is  the  first  of  many  WWT  plants  and  related\nprojects  to  be  carried  out  under  the  HRPPCP.  It  will  provide  for  the  treatment  of  wastewater\ndischarges that are presently dumped untreated into ditches and a raw sewage canal, and it will\nprovide for the collection and treatment of new connections as growth occurs.\n\nThe  service  area  for  the  Beicang  WWT  plant  was  confirmed  during  project  processing\n74. \nand  was  approved  at  the  Government  level.  Some  of  the  factors  involved  in  confirming  the\ndecision were: (i) networks in the city were implemented in the early years of development and\nexpanded along growth patterns; (ii) the siting of the six existing service areas was influenced\nby  topographical  constraints  such  as  the  Hai  River;  (iii)  the  flat  terrain  in  the  city  requires\npumping  stations  for  conveyance,  and  a  reasonable  balance  between  sewer  depths  and\npumping  facilities  is  achieved  by  dividing  the  city  into  multiple  service  areas;  and  (iv)  multiple\nWWT  plants  (a)  avoid  major  cross-city  conveyance  systems  and  related  pumping  costs;  (b)\nallow  flexibility  to  better  match  plant  size  with  growth;  and  (c)  allow  for  an  areal  distribution  of\neffluent  discharges,  thereby  spreading  the  residual  pollutant  load  to  the  receiving  waters  in\nTianjin. The basis for the Beicang WWT plant is considered sound.\n\n75. \nIn the feasibility study and the TA work, alternatives were evaluated in deciding upon the\nWWT  components,  the  WWT  plant  process,  and  sewer  routings  and  sizes.  The  WWT\ncomponent is technically justified because it will provide for a high level of WWT of existing and\nfuture  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater  from  a  major  area  in  urban  Tianjin.  The  estimated\nleast-cost  option  for  the  WWT  plant  process  and  the  sewer  system  were  selected  for  the\ncomponent.\n\n\f18\n\nPart  B,  the  WRP  component,  addresses  the  challenge  of  providing  clean  water  in\n76. \nadequate  quantities  and  of  acceptable  quality.  The  area  does  not  possess  adequate  water\nresources  to  sustain  needs,  and  the  import  of  water  from  outside  Tianjin  is  necessary.  The\nsituation  will  worsen  as  demands  increase  with  economic  growth.  While  additional  sources  of\ninterbasin  transfers,  desalination,  and  wastewater  reuse  are  available,  the  incremental  cost  of\nthese is much greater than maximizing use of presently available surface water sources. Hence,\nprotection of this source is extremely important and leads to broader environmental benefits not\nfound in alternative approaches.\n\nThe  existing  system,  developed  as  a  result  of  decreasing  groundwater  availability\n77. \nbecause  of  salinity  and  subsidence  problems  and  growth  demands  from  urban  development,\nrequires  corrective  measures  if  the  system  is  to  continue  to  be  viable.  The  Yuqiao  Reservoir,\noriginally designed for flood control and irrigation and not water supply, needs to be physically\nimproved and operationally controlled as a water supply source. Present pollution loads entering\nthe water body and in-reservoir activities are not acceptable. In the Zhou River section, natural\ndrainage, with attendant domestic sewerage, industrial waste flows, and agricultural run-off, was\ngated  to  prevent  contamination  of  the  water  supply  flowing  down  the  river  section.  This  is  not\neffective,  especially  during  flood  season.  The  unlined  water  supply  open  channel  has\nexperienced  problems  with  erosion,  infiltration  of  pollution,  and  some  exfiltration,  as  the  water\nlevels in the open channel are below the prevailing groundwater levels. The groundwater has a\nhigh concentration of chlorides, since there is no drainage system for irrigation return flows. The\nproposed component addresses these problems and provides reasonable solutions.\n\n78. \nThe  WRP  component  is  technically  justified  because  it  provides  basic  protection  of\nTianjin's  sole  public  water  supply  against  existing  and  increasing  pollution.  The  WRP\ncomponent is the least-cost option to achieve the desired level of pollution risk reduction in the\nZhou  River  section.  A  box  culvert  was  selected  rather  than  an  open  channels.  While  costing\nmore,  it  provides  the  minimum  acceptable  level  of  risk  of  pollution  of  the  raw  water  in  that\nsection. The least-cost closed conduit option has been selected. The component addresses the\nproblems of (i) nutrient loads fostering algae growth with its attendant impact on water treatment\noperations;  (ii)  exposure  to  biological  pollution  from  domestic  sources  and  chemical  pollution\nfrom industrial sources in Tianjin-controlled areas; (iii) water losses from the conveyance system\nbecause there will be no need to flush sections of the Zhou River, and there will be less leakage\nfrom  the  existing  open  channel  section;  and  (iv)  the  need  for  continued  isolation  of  drainage\nsections  along  the  Zhou  River  section.  This  last  aspect  of  the  component  will  allow  normal\ndrainage  conditions  for  about  40,000  of  agricultural  land,  adding  significantly  to  the  amount  of\nagriculturally-productive land in the Tianjin area. Under the TA study, a revised forecast of raw\nwater  supply  from  the  Luan-Tianjin  diversion  system  was  prepared,  indicating  full  use  of  the\nsystem by 2010.\n\n79. \nTML  obtains  water  from  the  Luan  River  in  Hebei  Province  through  allocations\ndetermined by MWR and formalized under the terms of an administration circular issued by the\nState  Council  on  12  June  1983.  This  circular  determines  the  water  allocation  from  the  Panda\nreservoirs that has to be shared between Tianjin and Hebei Province. It provides for 1.0 billion\nm3  of  water  to  be  available  to  Tianjin  on  an  annual  basis.  This  compares  to  Tianjin's  average\ncurrent requirements from the Luan river source of 500 million m3 per annum and indicates the\nsource  of  water  is  relatively  well  assured.  The  price  of  this  water  is  fixed  by  the  Government-\nlevel pricing authorities under the auspices of SDPC and in consultation with MWR. TMG has\naccepted  that  any  change  in  this  purchase  price  would  also  need  to  be  reflected  in  the  price\nTML sells raw water in order to maintain full cost recovery for its services. As TML is the sole\nprovider  of  raw  water  to  TWSC  and  other  bulk  users  of  water  in  Tianjin,  formalized  water\npurchase  agreements  are  not  considered  necessary.  The  sale  price  of  water  will  be  reviewed\n\n\f19\n\nand  adjusted  periodically  by  SDPC  and  MWR  in  accordance  with  price  regulations  contained\nwithin State Circular 1985 (44), which governs the pricing of water conservancy projects. These\nregulations  provide  for  raw  water  prices  to  be  fixed  on  the  basis  of  full  cost  recovery  together\nwith an allowable profit of 4-6 percent of capital employed.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n80. \nThe  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $340.7  million  equivalent,  comprising  $169.2  million  in\nforeign  exchange  costs  (49  percent)  and  $171.5  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.

The loan will finance 77 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The\nbalance  of  the  required  foreign  exchange  and  local  currency  requirements  will  be  provided  by\nTMG  as  equity,  and  through  cofinancing  by  a  loan  from  the  China  Development  Bank.  The\nfinancing  plan  for  the  Project  is  in  Table  2.  The  loan  will  be  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources at ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate for loans from the US dollar facility, with a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum and a front-end fee of 1.0 percent.

The Borrower will be the PRC.\n\nThe Borrower will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to TMG on the same terms and\n82. \nconditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  TMG  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  TSC  and  TML  through\nonlending  agreements  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  These  two\ncompanies will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for ADB\u2019s loan and\nreimburse TMG for any intermediation and transaction costs.

The project\nmanagement office (PMO), under the direction of a project leading group, will be responsible for\nadministering  all  matters  related  to  the  Project.  TMG  has  established  a  leading  group  and  an\nadministrative  office  to  coordinate  all  activities  related  to  the  Project.  The  Leading  Group,\nheaded by the Deputy Executive Mayor of Tianjin City, will provide guidance to the Project.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nThe Implementing Agencies\n\nThe day-to-day implementation of Parts A and B of the Project will be carried out by TSC\n84. \nand  TML.  During  project  implementation,  TSC  and  TML  will  be  supported  by  experienced\ndomestic and international consultants. The PMO and the project implementing agencies (PIAs)\nwill  retain  the  services  of  procurement  agencies  for  the  civil  works  contracts,  mechanical  and\nelectrical equipment, and materials. The PIAs will have a number of their staff trained in project\nimplementation. TSC and TML staff need to strengthen their expertise in (i) efficient operating\nprocedures; (ii) preventive maintenance; (iii) administration, accounting, financial planning, and\nmanagement;  (iv)  social  and  environmental  monitoring;  (v)  business  planning;  (vi)  human\nresources  development;  and  (vii)  cost  recovery  aspects,  including  cost  control  measures  and\ntariff review and methodologies to determine adjustments reflecting the impact of inflation and\ncurrency fluctuations. Capacity building for the PIAs will be achieved through consultant inputs,\nhands-on  training  on  project  facilities,  training  in  the  PRC,  and  possible  international  training\nfinanced from the loan.\n\na.\n\nLegal Status and Corporate Structure of Project Implementing\nAgencies\n\n85. \nTSC  was  registered  as  a  state-owned  enterprise  in  May  1996,  and  is  a  registered\ncompany  with  a  total  of  3,500  staff,  2,500  of  which  work  on  sewerage  operations.  TSC  was\nestablished  through  a  transfer  of  assets  and  staffing  from  the  former  Sewerage  Management\nDepartment  of  the  Tianjin  Engineering  Management  Bureau  and  its  formation  was  initially  a\ncondition  of  a  World  Bank  loan  agreement.  The  new  Beicang  WWT  plant  and  associated\nsewerage system extension will require TSC to hire about 200 more staff, although some of the\nneeded staff are expected to be made available through redeployment.\n\n\f21\n\nTML  was  registered  as  a  state-owned  enterprise  on  13  January  2000,  with  initial\n86. \nregistered capital of Y200 million ($24 million). The company is wholly owned by TMG under the\ndirection of Tianjin Water Conservancy Bureau.\n\n87. \nDuring  implementation,  the  management  of  TSC  and  TML  will  be  held  accountable  for\nsetting  and  managing  an  annual  budget  and  meeting  construction  and  other  implementation\ndeadlines. Once implementation has been completed, the companies will be responsible for all\naspects related to operations.\n\nb.\n\nFinancial Performance and Projections\n\nTSC and TML were established to construct38 and operate facilities for WWT and WRP.\n88. \nAll  costs  associated  with  the  current  operations  of  the  companies  will  be  capitalized  as\npreoperating and capital expenditures. Financial projections from 1 January 2006 for TSC and\nfor the first full year of operations for TML, and the critical assumptions, are given in Appendix 5.\nThe financial projections, based on water and wastewater demand projections and incorporating\nthe  projected  tariff  increases  for  raw  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  required  under  the  Project,\nindicate  sound  levels  of  financial  performance.  Cash  flows  are  sufficient  to  meet  all  operating\ncosts  and  debt  and  equity  servicing  requirements.  Targeted  ratios  have  been  estimated  and\nhave  been  covenanted  in  the  loan  agreement.

Water  is  sold  by  Tianjin  Luan  River  Diversion  Bureau  to  TML  under  a  water  supply\nagreement.  The  intention  is  for  this  agreement  to  remain  unchanged  and  to  be  taken  over  by\nTML, except that the price of raw water sold by TML will need to increase to finance Luan River\nDiversion improvements. Details of the existing agreement include (i) price set at Y0.40/m3 for\nurban  water  supplies  and  industrial  supply  with  no  return  to  the  Hai  River;  and  Y0.13/m3  for\nsupplies  with  discharge  return  to  the  Hai  River  (cooling  water);  (ii)  Tianjin  Water  Supply\nCompany  to  take  an  average  of  550  million  m3/year;  and  (iii)  no  minimum  purchase  amount.\nThese  tariffs  became  effective  on  1  November  1999,  raised  from  Y.025/m3  and  Y0.10/m3,\nrespectively, an increase of about 62 percent. The water tariff will have to be reviewed regularly\n                                                \n38 Under  PRC  requirements,  all  projects  financed  from  external  sources  must  be  implemented  by  a  company\n\nspecifically established for this purpose so as to foster commercial principles and accountability.\n\n\f22\n\nto  ensure  regularly  that  adequate  provision  is  made  to  reflect  increases  that  may  occur  in  the\noperating costs, including increases in water resources fees and other charges.\n\n2.\n\nProject Management\n\nA  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established  under  the  Tianjin  Municipal\n91. \nDevelopment Planning Commission through official notification. The PMO will be the secretariat\nof  the  steering  committee  and  will  liaise  with  the  administrative  office  of  TMG.  The  PMO  will\ninclude a project director, a full-time deputy director, five full-time professional staff, and support\nstaff. The PMO will manage and coordinate the work of the two PIAs (TSC and TML) through\ntheir respective project implementation units. Each PIA will set up project implementation units,\nheaded by general managers, to coordinate with the PMO and facilitate timely implementation\nof  project  activities.  PIAs  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  activities.  An\norganization chart is provided in Appendix 6.\n\n3.\n\nPerformance Contracts\n\nFormal  performance  contracts  between  TMG  and  the  PIAs  will  define  the  relationships\n92. \nbetween each party and detail the strategic requirements placed on the PIAs. The performance\ncontracts include business plans and institutional and management development action plans,\nand  address  service  levels,  strategic  targets,  and  other  operational  aspects.  The  performance\nframework contracts are given as a supplementary appendix.\n\n4.\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\n93. \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of five years (Appendix 7). This schedule\nis  considered  realistic  because  the  project  implementation  structure  is  already  in  place,  and\npreparatory  works  are  under  way.  ADB\u2019s  successful  experience  in  similar  projects  in  the  PRC\nand  the  TMG\u2019s  in-depth  knowledge  and  experience  in  wastewater  pollution  control,  raw  water\nprotection, and supply projects indicates that this schedule is realistic and achievable.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n94. \nThe  PIAs  will  retain  the  services  of  competent  and  experienced  design  institutes  to\ncomplete the feasibility studies, preliminary design, detailed designs, and specifications. These\nconsultants will be recruited through standard PRC procedures acceptable to ADB. In addition,\nthe  PIAs  will  retain  the  services  of  tendering  agencies,  following  standard  PRC  procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB,  to  help  prepare  tendering,  contract  documents,  and  local  competitive\nbidding procedures for (i) the prequalification of contractors; (ii) tendering and bid evaluation for\nthe  procurement  of  various  equipment,  materials,  and  civil  works  contract  packages;  and  (iii)\nprovision  of  qualified  construction  supervision  companies  for  each  part  of  the  Project.  The\nselection of the consultants for design, tendering, and construction supervision will be subject to\nADB approval with respect to their competence and experience for each assignment and will be\nfunded the counterpart funds.\n\n95. \nIn  addition,  provision  has  been  made  for  65  person-months  of  international  and  130\nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  to  support  the  PMO  and  the  PIAs  in  project\nimplementation and capacity building to be funded under the loan. These consultants will provide\nassistance to the PMO in the areas of ADB procedures and reporting, international specifications,\ndesign  and  construction,  tendering  procedures,  evaluation  of  bids,  standard  contracts,  quality\ncontrol,  and  the  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  The  consultants  will  provide\nadvice,  guidance,  and  training  for  capacity  building  necessary  to  convert  the  PIAs  from\nconstruction into operating companies upon completion of implementation. International consulting\nwill  be  provided  for  (i)  the  development  of  a  corporate  management  structure;  (ii)  training  in  the\n\n\f23\n\ndevelopment of standardized financial and accounting statements; (iii) midterm and final review of\nretail  water  and  wastewater  tariffs;  (iv)  monitoring  of  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental\nimpacts;  and  (v)  advice  on  the  method  and  procedures  for  benefit  monitoring  and  resettlement.\nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 8. In addition to\ntraining provided by consultants, the PIAs will use loan funds to finance broader training-related\nexpenses. The PIAs will submit detailed training programs and budgets for ADB approval prior\nto proceeding with such training activities. Disbursements for approved training expenditures will\nbe through the imprest account (para. 97).\n\n6.\n\nProcurement\n\nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\n96. \nfor Procurement. Major contracts for equipment will be undertaken through ADB\u2019s international\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures,  and  equipment  packages  valued  under  $500,000  will  be\nprocured  following  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  international  shopping.  Civil  works  estimated  to  cost\nbelow  $8  million  per  package  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)\nprocedures acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law\nand procurement regulations.39 Local contractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake\nsuch works. Since such civil works will involve mainly labor costs, international contractors are\nnot  likely  to  be  interested  in  the  work  and  the  use  of  LCB  is  considered  acceptable.  In\naccordance  with  ADB  requirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  the  bidding  for  LCB\ncontracts. The major construction materials will be purchased through international competitive\nbidding  procedures  and  financed  by  the  ADB  loan.  Indicative  procurement  packages  are\nprovided in Appendix 9. The mode of procurement will be decided by TMG in consultation with\nADB.  The  internationally  tendered  equipment  packages  will  include  the  technical  support\nnecessary  for  ensuring  proper  installation,  testing,  commissioning,  and  training  of  operational\nstaff as part of the related contracts. This approach is the most efficient way to ensure quality\ncontrol  during  installation  and  proper  operational  training  in  the  use  of  the  equipment  as  the\nmanufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 technical experts will be the people most familiar with all aspects\nof the equipment.\n\n7.\n\nDisbursement\n\n97. \nTo facilitate disbursements for numerous small expenditures, an imprest account will be\nestablished  after  loan  effectiveness  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\n(June  1996).  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate\nwithdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will  demonstrate,\namong  other  things,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  were  (i)  produced  in  and  procured  from\nADB's members, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into the\nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  $300,000.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be\nused  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures;  any  individual  contract  to  be  reimbursed  or\nliquidated under the procedure will not exceed $50,000.\n\n                                                \n39 ADB assisted in the establishment of national procurement regulations for the public sector under TA 2845-PRC:\nEstablishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector,  for  $565,000,  approved  on  20  August\n1997, including the drafting of six regulations and three sample bidding documents.\n\n\f24\n\n8. \n\nAdvance Procurement and Recruitment Action\n\n98. \nAdvance  action  was  approved  on  5  June  2000  to  expedite  project  implementation.\nAdvance action, which may take place prior to loan effectiveness, includes (i) prequalification of\ncontractors,  tendering  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  work  contract  packages;  (ii)  preparation  of\ntender  documents  for  the  procurement  of  materials,  plant,  equipment,  and  vehicles;  and  (iii)\nrecruitment of domestic and international consultants for construction supervision and training.\nTML  and  TSC  were  advised  that  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  or  to  prequalify  under  advance\nprocurement action was subject to approval by the ADB. All advance procurement actions will\nbe  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Procurement,  and  advance\nrecruitment of consultants will be carried out in conformity with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants. The Government, TML and TSC were advised that approval of advance action\ndoes not commit the ADB to finance the Project. This action was reported in the June issue of\nADB Business Opportunities.\n\n9.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nAll permanent works constructed under the Project will be owned by TSC and TML for\n99. \ntheir  respective  components,  and  each  company  will  each  be  responsible  for  the  O&M  of  its\ncomponent.  Prior  to  commissioning  of  the  works,  both  companies  will  recruit  any  necessary\nadditional personnel. Appropriate training will be provided to any new personnel.\n\n10.\n\nProject Reviews\n\n100. \nIn addition to the normal periodic reviews, a midterm review will be undertaken by ADB\nand  the  Government  two  years  after  project  implementation  begins.  This  review  will  include  a\ndetailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of\nscheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the  agenda  for  policy  reform  and  capacity  building\nmeasures. A detailed review of the wholesale water prices for the Project, as well as retail level\ntariffs, will be undertaken. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed.\n\n11.\n\nAnticorruption\n\n101.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  to\nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed\ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption\nprovisions in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\n\n102.  The PRC country assistance plan includes assistance that will improve governance and\nprovide  incentives  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  corruption  in  the  longer  term.  The  TA  for  the\nPRC\u2019s  procurement  regulations  (footnote  39)  provided  assistance  to  draft  procurement  and\nstandard bidding documents. In 1998 ADB provided TA40 to help strengthen the Government\u2019s\nauditing  standards.  The  goal  of  that  TA  is  to  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  auditing  system  to\nconform with the requirements of the audit law, and as far as practicable, international auditing\nstandards. The TA helped (i) formulate Government auditing standards and procedures, and (ii)\ndesign  and  implement  an  audit-training  program  to  promote  adherence  to  such  auditing\nstandards and procedures by Government auditors.\n\n                                                \n40 TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.\n\n\f25\n\n12.\n\nReports and Auditing\n\n103.  The PMO and the PIAs will maintain separate accounts for Parts A and B of the Project.\nThe  PIAs  will  maintain  records  of  all  project  expenditures  and  forward  these  regularly  to  the\nPMO,  and  the  PMO  will  prepare  consolidated  project  accounts.  The  consolidated  project\naccounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  the  Tianjin  Municipal  Audit  Bureau  and  by  independent\nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  such  audited  accounts  in  English  will  be\nsubmitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  six  months  after  the  end  of  the  financial  year  to  which  they\nrelate. As the ADB loan will be onlent to the PIAs, audited financial statements of the two PIAs\nwill  be  submitted  to  ADB  annually  also  no  later  than  six  months  after  the  end  of  the  relevant\nfinancial year. The PMO will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of the\nloan  proceeds,  the  Project,  and  the  administration  and  financial  information  of  the  PIAs.  The\nreports will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports;\nand (iii) a project completion report, not later than three months after completion of the Project.\nProgress  reports  will  emphasize  progress  made  in  the  areas  of  policy  dialogue,  including  (i)\nwater  and  wastewater  tariff  changes,  (ii)  environmental  and  water  quality  monitoring,  (iii)\nresettlement, and (iv) capacity building and financial management of TSC and TML.\n\n104.  As a result of policy dialogue during project processing, audit committees of the board of\ndirectors of the PIAs will be established. The committees will review internal and external audit\nreports and consider other issues of corporate governance. Each audit committee will meet at\nleast once every six months.\n\n13.\n\nProject Performance Management System\n\n105.  The  PPMS  will  be  integrated  into  the  project  management  information  system  of  the\nPMO  and  linked  to  the  two  PIAs.  Indicators  that  have  been  agreed  on  include  service  levels,\ntreated water quality, incidence of water-related diseases, water consumption, user satisfaction,\nand other economic data to monitor project impacts on improved living conditions and economic\nopportunities related to (i) improved water supply and sewage treatment facilities and services,\n(ii)  improved  quality  of  life,  (iii)  resettlement,  (iv)  physical  completion,  (v)  institutional\nstrengthening, and (vi) policy reforms. At the beginning of the Project, the PMO and PIAs, with\nthe assistance of consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically\ngenerate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  two  project  components  and  socioeconomic  and\nenvironmental indicators to measure project impacts. The PMO and PIAs will refine the PPMS\nframework,  confirm  achievable  goals,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and\nestablish systems and procedures no later than six months after loan effectiveness.\n\n106.  Under  the  PPMS  framework,  baseline  and  annual  data  will  be  reported  at  regular\nintervals  by  each  PIA.  Each  PIA  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data\nthrough  its  management  information  system.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate\nflexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and\ndevelopment impacts. The PMO, with the assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess\nactivities, and report to ADB quarterly on the physical implementation and financial aspects of\nthe Project to ensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n107.  As  the  Project  is  classified  as  a  Category  A  environmental  project,  an  environmental\nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  is  required.  In  accordance  with  the  PRC  environmental  laws  and\nguidelines, EIA outlines and reports have been prepared for each project component. The EIA\n\n\f26\n\nreports for the WWT and WRP components have been approved by SEPA. The summary EIA\nwas prepared and circulated to the ADB Board on 28 February 2000.\n\n108.  The EIAs conclude that the Project will have substantial positive environmental benefits\nfor  the  environmental  quality  and  the  quality  of  drinking  water  in  Tianjin  City,  and,  with  the\nplanned mitigation measures in place, will have an insignificant adverse impact on the physical\nand natural environment. The Project will improve the living environment of residents in areas it\nserves  and  make  appreciable  contributions  to  the  water  pollution  control  program  of  the  Hai\nRiver Basin. The Project will safeguard the drinking water quality of Tianjin's sole water supply\nsource, help to create conditions to raise living standards, and improve public health conditions\nfor  residents.  The  WWT  component  is  an  important  link  in  the  implementation  of  the  overall\nsewerage development plan for urban Tianjin.\n\n109.  The  WWT  component  includes  a  secondary  WWT  plant  that  will  serve  the  Beichen\ndistrict,  an  urban  district  with  rapid  industrial  and  commercial  development  without  WWT\nfacilities.  The  biological  treatment  process  selected  (para.  66)  is  highly  efficient  at  removing\nphosphorus.  Bohai  Bay  has  experienced  increasingly  serious  occurrences  of  red  tide  due  to\nexcessive nutrient (especially phosphorus) loading.\n\n110.  Sludge  disposal  is  one  of  the  most  significant  aspects  of  WWT  operations.  Dewatered\nsludge from TSC\u2019s Dongjao WWT plant is presently given to farmers for agricultural uses since\nits quality meets the relevant standard. Two options will be provided for sludge disposal: (i) for\nagricultural  use,  if  the  quality  meets  the  standard;  and  (ii)  shipping  the  dewatered  sludge  to  a\nlandfill at the Xianyang Road WWT plant when, in exceptional cases, the quality does not meet\nthe standard.\n\n111.  SEPA  has  issued  a  deadline  of  31  December  2000  for  all  industrial  wastewater\ndischargers  in  the  PRC  to  meet  the  relevant  standards,  including  pretreatment  requirements.\nThose  that  fail  to  do  this  will  face  factory  closure  or  production  reduction.  TMG  set  its  own\ndeadline as 31 December 1999. So far, over 800 industries in Tianjin have complied, while 24\nfactories  have  been  closed  and  24  other  factories  have  had  their  production  levels  reduced.\nThroughout  the  Luan  River  diversion  project  area,  which  includes  upstream  areas  in  Hebei\nProvince, more than 40 factories have complied. Intensive pollution monitoring is undertaken in\nthe  Yuquiao  Reservoir  area.  Tianjin\u2019s  efforts  and  achievements  on  industrial  pollution  control\nhave been commended by SEPA. To address transjurisdictional pollution, TMG is coordinating\nwith the Hai River Basin Commission and the Hebei government on the control of phosphorus\nemission from two major fertilizer plants in Zunhua municipality, Hebei Province.\n\nIndustrial wastewater discharging into municipal sewer systems is monitored four times\n112. \na  year,  twice  by  TEPB  and  twice  by  local  environmental  quality  monitoring  stations.  Industrial\nestablishments, however, monitor their discharges sometimes as frequently as several times a\nday depending on their size. In accordance with international practice, TSC plans to undertake a\ncomprehensive  monitoring  program  of  its  own  with  a  higher  frequency,  especially  for  larger\ndischargers and those with highly polluting wastewater. This will ensure compliance, resulting in\nbetter quality of sludge and plant effluent, greatly enhancing their reuse potential.\n\n113.  The  effluent  from  the  proposed  Beicang  WWT  plant  will  be  discharged  into  the\nYongdingxin  River.  To  avoid  pollution  from  raw  sewage  being  pumped  from  the  Beicang\nsewerage catchment area into the river at the present time, a small portion of the river channel\nwas separated from the main channel, which preserves the water quality in the main channel for\nirrigation.  With  the  operation  of  the  Beicang  WWT  plant,  its  effluent  quality  will  also  meet  the\nrequirement  for  irrigation  use.  The  addition  of  the  effluent  to  the  storage  system  behind  the\nchannel's weir, for use during the dry season, represents a potential increase of irrigated area\nby 5,500 ha. This arrangement will reduce pollution discharge to Bohai Bay.\n\n\f27\n\n114.  With  the  construction  of  the  new  closed  conduit  channel,  the  Zhou  River  stretch  will\nrevert  to  its  original  function  to  carry  away  storm  runoff  and  wastewater  from  neighboring\ncommunities as well as its base flow. At present, because this stretch is used for water supply\ndiversion, these communities suffer from the accumulation of wastewater in ponds and ditches,\nresulting in an undesirable living environment, increased incidence of waterborne diseases, and\nthreats to public health. The new closed conduit will appreciably improve the environment of the\naffected area.\n\n115.  The  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mainly  associated  with  the\nconstruction  phase.  These  impacts  are  shortterm  and  relate  to  noise,  vibration,  air  pollution,\nrunoff,  safety  hazards,  disposal  of  construction  debris,  and  localized  traffic  congestion.\nAppropriate mitigation measures will be incorporated into the detailed engineering designs and\nconstruction contracts. The PIAs, in cooperation with TEPB, will monitor construction contracts\nand enforce compliance with environmental regulations and standards.\n\n116.  The  Tianjin  Environmental  Monitoring  Center  (TEMC)  of  TEPB  is  well  equipped  to\nundertake environmental quality monitoring for the Project. TEMC, with 200 staff, has offices for\nintegrated  planning,  technical  development,  water  environment,  atmospheric  environment,\ninstrumentation,  physics  (noise  and  vibration),  soil  ecology  (including  solid  waste),  and  traffic\npollution  monitoring.  TEMC  is  certified  by  the  State  Technical  Standards  Bureau  for  analytical\nquality  assurance  and  control  and  the  certification  is  renewed  every  five  years  to  ensure  the\nmaintenance  of  good  practice.  The  certification  ensures  the  accuracy  of  analytical  results  and\ngives legal standing to the results. The main task in the Project for TEMC will be to (i) carry out\nthe monitoring programs for the construction, start-up, and operations phases; and (ii) prepare\nreports on relevant monitoring work by the local environmental quality monitoring stations.\n\n2.\n\nPublic Participation\n\n117.  Direct public involvement has been ongoing throughout the development and design of\nthe  Project.  During  preparation  of  the  EIA,  public  participation  occurred  during  (i)  site\ninvestigations for facilities, (ii) the preparation of social impact assessments, (iii) the evaluation\nof priorities and estimation of the value of benefits, and (iv) community surveys undertaken to\ngauge  public  reactions  to  the  Project.  One  hundred  questionnaires  were  distributed  to  people\nliving  near  the  WWT  plant  site.  The  response  rate  was  89  percent  and  94  percent  of  the\nrespondents  expressed  support  for  the  component.  Questionnaires  (828)  were  distributed  to\npeople  living  within  the  WRP  component  area.  The  response  rate  was  88  percent,  with  99\npercent of the respondents from the urban area of TMG stating that the component is important.\n\n3.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n118.  Tianjin Municipal Development Planning Commission, in collaboration with consultants,\nprepared  the  project  resettlement  plan  (RP).  Both  components  involve  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement effects, and a comprehensive RP has been prepared for the Project on the basis of\nthe  feasibility  studies.  The  RP  will  comply  with  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law,  which  was\ndrafted  with  ADB  assistance,  for  the  WWT  component,  and  the  1991  MWR  Regulations  for\nMedium and Large Water Hydropower Project Construction, for the WRP component. The RP\nprovides compensation and other assistance to people affected including both legal and illegal\nland  users.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  (SRP),  given  in  Appendix  10,  provides  detailed\ninformation  for  each  project  component.  The  RP  will  be  reviewed,  revised,  and  appropriately\nmodified after the preliminary technical design for each component has been finalized. Copies\nof  the  revised  RP  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  prior  to  commencement  of  land  clearing.  This  will\ninclude livelihood restoration plans. Affected people (APs) have been consulted, and a detailed\nconsultation plan is included in the RP. The PIAs released the Chinese version of the SRP to\n\n\f28\n\nthe districts and counties for release to the affected township offices and review by APs before\nloan  negotiations.  TMG  agreed  to  post  the  SRP  on  the  ADB  website  and  to  make  the  SRP\npublicly available through affected township offices, for review by APs prior to loan negotiations.\n\n119.  The 45 villages around the Yuqiao Reservoir will be affected, 80 villages will be affected\nby the upgrade of the existing channel and the Zhou River diversion channel, and one township\nwill be affected to accommodate the Beicang WWT plant. Permanent land acquisition of 430 ha\nwill  be  required  affecting  over  3,000  APs  in  900  households.  Temporary  land  acquisition  will\nimpact 550 ha (with 6,367 APs in 1,591 households). Physical relocation of 12 households (56\nAPs)  is  expected.  The  Project  will  eliminate  960  ha  of  fishponds  (with  1,280  APs  in  430\nhouseholds).  No  community  structures  or  public  institutions  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.\nRestrictions in the Yuqiao Reservoir buffer zone are not expected to have any adverse impact\non land use or yields and therefore no loss of livelihood is anticipated for people in this area.\n\n120.  The organization and management structure of the PIAs are adequate to implement the\nRP.  The  key  agencies  involved  in  the  preparation  of  the  RP  are  represented  in  the  relevant\ndepartments  within  each  PIA,  which  should  ensure  effective  coordination  and  implementation.\nThe PIAs will ensure that all implementing personnel are briefed fully on the RP. In addition to\nthe  internal  monitoring  carried  out  by  TSC  and  TML,  a  qualified  institute  will  be  selected  to\nundertake independent monitoring and evaluation of resettlement impacts. Entitlements will be\nprovided  to  the  APs  in  full  before  demolition  and  ground  leveling  commence,  and  before  any\nloss  of  land  takes  place.  The  county  and  township  resettlement  offices  will  play  an  important\nrole  in  briefing  the  township  and  village  personnel  on  RP  provisions;  making  the  RP  public;\nensuring  that  APs  are  aware  of  compensation  entitlements,  job  creation  schemes,  training\nactivities,  and  relocation  sites;  and  reflecting  the  APs\u2019  comments  and  concerns  in  the  revised\nRP and during its implementation. These offices will ensure that all compensation payments and\nother  specified  assistance  will  be  paid  directly  to  the  collectives,  enterprises,  and  individuals\naffected, and there will not be any deductions in the rates.\n\n4.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n121.  During  the  project  design,  500  project  beneficiary  households  were  surveyed  to\ndetermine  the  patterns  of  water  use,  the  attitudes  of  the  local  population  toward  water,\nwastewater, and sanitation cost; satisfaction with current water quality; willingness to pay; and\naffordability.  About  79  percent  of  those  surveyed  stated  that  a  clean  environment  was  either\nimportant  or  very  important  to  them.  Half  of  the  respondents  identified  improvement  in  water\nsupply as the highest priority, with 56-64 percent of this subgroup, in various districts, willing to\npay for improvements. The most requested improvement was for better water quality.\n\n122.  The survey data indicated that interviewees in the middle income bracket (earning Y500-\nY1,500/month) were willing to pay for clean water and wastewater services. Based on income\ndata collected and assuming that people spend Y10/month on water, at present people spend 1\npercent of their income on water. Health data collected and analyzed indicates that benefits that\ncan be derived from improvements in drainage and sanitation throughout the project areas and\nin reducing the risk to the safety of the public water supply.\n\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n123.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2000\nprices.  Financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  analysis  was  undertaken  for  each  component.\n\n\f29\n\nThe  FIRRs,  10.7  percent  for  the  WWT  component  and  14.5  percent  for  the  WRP  component,\ncompare  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  4.9  percent  for  the  WWT\ncomponent and 4.4 percent for the WRP component. Component FIRRs are high since current\ntariffs  are  low  and  the  components  are  only  part  of  current  operations.  Tariff  increases  are\nrequired to ensure the financial sustainability of the companies. A sensitivity analysis is given in\nTable 4 and the financial evaluation is shown in Appendix 11.\n\nTable 4: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nScenario\n\nBase Case\nCosts increase by 10 percent\nRevenues decrease by 10 percent\nOne-year delay in revenues\nExchange rate devaluation by 30 percent\nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio; FIRR = financial internal rate of return; WACC= weighted average cost of capital\n\nWACC\n(percent)\n4.9\n\nMinimum\nDSCR\n9.4\n\nWastewater Treatment\nFIRR\n(percent)\n10.7\n8.7\n8.5\n7.5\n8.5\n\nMinimum\nDSCR\n1.8\n\nWater Resources Protection\nFIRR\nWACC\n(percent)\n(percent)\n14.5\n4.4\n13.2\n13.0\n12.6\n12.7\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n124.  The  economic  analysis  was  conducted  over  a  25-year  period  inclusive  of  the  project\nconstruction period, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.\nEconomic benefits and costs were denominated in terms of the domestic price numeraire and\nexpressed in constant 2000 prices. Project benefits and costs were estimated on a without and\nwith-project  basis  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  being  tradable  or  nontradable.  Tradable\ncomponents  were  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.11,\nand nontraded components were valued at domestic market prices. A shadow wage rate factor\nof 0.8 was applied to the unskilled labor costs. For the WWT component, benefits were valued\non the basis of incremental financial tariffs and net additional agricultural output. For the WRP\ncomponent,  benefits  were  valued  on  the  basis  of  resource  cost  savings  and  net  additional\nagricultural output. The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.2 percent for the\nWWT  component,  14.7  percent  for  the  WRP  component,  and  14.8  percent  overall.  For  both\ncomponents,  the  EIRR  is  expected  to  understate  the  full  economic  benefits  since  all  indirect\neconomic growth and risk aversion benefits are not encapsulated in the calculation. A sensitivity\nanalysis  (Appendix  12)  indicates  that  both  components  remain  economically  viable  under\nadverse benefit and cost assumption testing.\n\n3.\n\nFiscal Impact\n\n125.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  was  verified  through  the  financial  analysis  of\nTSC and TML, and through a review of the urban water demand. The financial projections for\nTSC  and TML indicate  that the  Project will achieve the minimum debt service coverage ratios\nand acceptable rates of return on equity. Financial affordability analysis based on the proposed\ncombined retail water supply and wastewater tariff was undertaken and show estimated monthly\nbills  would  be  around  2  percent  of  average  household  income  and  around  5  percent  of  the\nincome  of  households  considered  to  be  poor.  To  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  have  an\nadverse fiscal impact on either TML or the Tianjin Water Supply Company, wholesale and retail\ntariffs were structured on the basis of achieving full cost recovery. The annual return on equity\nfrom the Project is about 6 percent in real terms.\n\n\f30\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n126.  The  Project  will  have  substantial  positive  environmental  benefits  by  improving  water\nquality  and  the  living  environment  (paras.  108  and  114).  Adverse  project  impacts  on  the\nenvironment will be minimal and will be mitigated. A comprehensive monitoring program for the\npreconstruction,  construction,  and  operation  phases  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  all\nmitigation requirements are met. The Project also addresses the problem that farmland close to\nthe Zhou River is periodically flooded with contaminated water that cannot be released into the\nriver  system.  Approximately  40,000  ha  of  land  is  affected,  although  waterlogged  land  is  still\nfarmed. With the Project, this land will be brought back into agricultural production by eliminating\nthe flooding problem.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n127.  The  Project  will  improve  the  living  environment  of  the  residents  in  areas  it  will  serve\n(paras.  108  and  114),  the  Hai  River  Basin,  and  the  lower  reaches  of  the  Yongdingxin  River,\nenabling the expansion of the irrigated area at the same time.\n\n128.  Women  play  an  important  role  as  income  earners  and  are  well  represented  in  the\nworkforce in Tianjin. Most women are involved in the cash economy in some way. Many provide\nadditional  household  income  through  either  wage  labor  or  small-scale  trading  and  businesses\nsuch as restaurants or laundry shops. Women work at home as much as outside the home and\nare  responsible  for  household  duties  and  looking  after  children,  the  elderly,  and  the  sick.  A\nnumber of project impacts will directly benefit women. First, with the improved water supply and\navailability, women will require less time and resources in managing day-to-day domestic duties.\nSecond, improved water quality will reduce the incidence of water-related illnesses, potentially\nsaving time and money spent on medical care. Hygiene standards and health will improve as a\nresult  of  the  Project.  Other  measures  included  will  also  ensure  that  women  benefit  from  the\nProject,  such  as  equal  employment  opportunities  in  TSC  and  TML,  and  during  construction  of\nfacilities.\n\nD.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\n129.  Historically,  poverty  has  been  concentrated  in  rural  areas  in  the  PRC.  However,  in  the\n1990s,  urban  poverty  began  to  emerge.  Rapid  rural-urban  migration,  the  floating  populations\nand the laying off of redundant workers has contributed to rapidly growing urban poverty. Urban\npoverty  is  now  a  major  concern  of  the  Government.  There  is  little  consolidated  information\navailable on urban poverty in the PRC. ADB has provided TA41 to help fill this gap. Tianjin is one\nof the cities that might be included in an urban poverty study financed by ADB.\n\n130.  The Tianjin urban area has a per capita average urban annual income of Y7,110, higher\nthan the national average. If the international standard of $1/day is used to define rural poverty,\nand  $3/day  to  define  urban  poverty  in  east  coast  cities,  both  adjusted  for  purchasing  power\nparities,42  about  5  percent  of  Tianjin's  urban  population,  or  210,000  of  the  Project\u2019s\nbeneficiaries, live in poverty. The Project will help reduce poverty by (i) preventing increases in\nthe  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  which  will  reduce  spending  on  medical  care  and  sick\ndays taken, thus providing more income to households; (ii) safeguarding the quality of drinking\nwater  and  improvements  in  wastewater  services  (poverty  goes  beyond  income  levels  and\nincludes deprivation of essential assets and opportunities to which every human is entitled); and\n\n                                                \n41 TA 3377-PRC: Urban Poverty Study, for $410,000, approved on 22 December 1999.\n42 Using this methodology, the rural and urban poverty lines for Tianjin would be Y962 and Y2,286, respectively.\n\n\f31\n\n(iii)  providing  equal  opportunity  to  women,  as  women  are  typically  more  at  risk  of  falling  into\npoverty than men.\n\nE.\n\nRisks\n\n131.  Potential  financial  and  policy  risks  related  to  the  Project  include  failure  (i)  of  TMG  to\nmeet  the  cash/equity  transfers  required  to  construct  the  Project;  (ii)  of  TMG  to  generate\nadequate political support to increase water tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; (iii) of TMG to\neffectively  enforce  its  discharge  monitoring  program;  (iv)  of  upstream  pollution  management\nunder the HRPPCP for the water resources component; (v) of TMG to construct sufficient sewer\nconnections  for  the  WWT  component;  and  (vi)  to  implement,  in  parallel  with  project\nimplementation, the dam safety program for the WRP component.\n\n132.  The potential financial and policy risks have been mitigated by assurances related to the\nfinancial  and  managerial  autonomy  for  TSC  and  TML.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor  TSC\nand  TML  compliance  with  the  financial  and  operational  covenants  to  ensure  their  financial\nsustainability.  With  a  commitment  letter  provided  by  the  Tianjin  Finance  Bureau  ensuring  the\nlocal equity contribution for the two components, local funding is not expected to be a constraint.\nThe  companies\u2019  assurance  to  (i)  establish  an  account  to  cover  four  months  of  operating\nexpenditures; and (ii) set up a debt service account with sufficient funds to cover four months of\ndebt  service  payments  under  the  ADB  loan  are  also  measures  to  mitigate  financial  risks.  The\nProject does not have any unusual technical risks. The raw water and transmission mains and\nWWT  plant  included  in  the  Project  will  use  standard  technology  common  throughout  the  PRC\nthat conforms to international standards. Specific construction risks will be mitigated by the use\nof experienced domestic and international consultants to prepare detailed designs and monitor\nimplementation.  The  risk  of  delay  in  construction  has  been  addressed  through  ongoing\nsynchronization efforts and TMG\u2019s confirmation of the appointment of the deputy mayor as chair\nof the Project. Upstream pollution management of the WRP component will be addressed under\nthe Hai River Basin Management Plan. TMG has agreed to commit to the dam safety program\nand related enhancements.\n\nVI. ASSURANCES\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following\n\n133. \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents:\n\n1.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n134.  Compliance with Laws and Regulations.  TMG will ensure that all land and rights of\nway  required  for  the  Project  are  made  available  in  timely  manner.  TMG  and  each  PIA  will\nensure  that  the  provisions  of  the  RP  agreed  with  ADB,  including  compensation  and  other\nentitlements for affected persons (APs), are in accordance with all applicable government laws\nand  regulations  and  ADB's  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  Within  three  months  after  loan\neffectiveness, the RP will be amplified to reflect details of preliminary technical design and will\ninclude a livelihood restoration program satisfactory to ADB.\n\n135. \nImplementation.  TMG and each PIA will ensure that (i) all necessary measures have\nbeen taken to ensure timely implementation of the RP, including public consultations with APs;\nand  (ii)  every  AP  is  fully  compensated  and  assisted  prior  to  displacement  from  housing,  land,\nlivelihood sources, and/or assets, in accordance with the RP so that such APs are at least as\nwell off as they would have been in the absence of the Project.\n\n\f32\n\n136.  Budget.    TMG  and  each  PIA  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for  land\nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities  specified  under  the  RP.  TMG  and  each  PIA  will  ensure\nthat counterpart funds for compensation entitlements under the RP are fully provided directly to\nAPs and the relevant village organizations.\n\n137.  Monitoring and Reporting.  TMG and each PIA will ensure that (i) adequate staff and\nresources are committed for internal monitoring of the implementation of the RP and appropriate\nmeasures, including internal monitoring reviews, will be undertaken during RP implementation;\n(ii) an independent domestic monitoring agency will be selected in accordance with procedures\nacceptable  to  the  ADB  to  carry  out  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  bi-annual  reviews  during  RP\nimplementation;  and  (iii)  a  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  a  methodology\nfor socioeconomic assessments of the impacts of resettlement under the Project, acceptable to\nADB, will be established.\n\n138.  Each PIA will coordinate with and oversee authorities involved in resettlement activities\nunder  the  Project,  to  ensure  effective  RP  implementation,  and  will  provide  periodic  reports  to\nADB on the progress of land acquisition and resettlement.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironment\n\n139.  General.    TMG  and  the  PIAs  will  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are  constructed,\noperated, maintained, and monitored in strict conformity with (i) all applicable government laws\nand  regulations,  including  national  and  local  environmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and\noccupational safety regulations and standards; (ii) the environmental mitigation and monitoring\nmeasures  detailed  in  the  EIA  and  summary  EIA  for  the  Project  approved  by  SEPA;  and  (iii)\napplicable ADB requirements.\n\n140.  Monitoring.    Each  PIA  will  ensure,  among  others,  that  its  respective  environmental\nmonitoring  offices  will  include  an  adequate  number  of  full-time  personnel,  and  sufficient\nresources  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring  program,  under\nguidance  of  TEPB  through  TEMC  and  that  annual  environmental  reports  will  be  submitted  to\nADB until commencement of commercial operation of the project facilities.\n\n141.  Water  Resources  Safety  and  Protection.  TMG  and  TML  will  ensure  that  (i)  the\ndetailed design of Part B of the Project adequately addresses Yuqiao Reservoir safety concerns\nand  incorporates  a  program  for  completion  of  pressurized  grouting  of  the  Reservoir  Dam,\nincluding regular monitoring; (ii) sufficient funds are made available for timely completion of the\npressurized grouting program of the Reservoir Dam; (iii) a comprehensive study and evaluation\nof  the  modification  of  fish  ponds  within  the  relevant  protective  dike  at  the  inlet  of  the  Yuqiao\nReservoir  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  before  any  biological  treatment  basin  or  other\nenvironmental  improvement  activities  are  started  that  could  affect  the  fish  ponds  remaining\naround the Yuqiao Reservoir.\n\n142.  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant  and  Related.  TMG  and  TSC  will  ensure  that  (i)  the\ndetailed  design  of  the  Beicang  WWT  plant  adequately  addresses  potential  irrigation  reuse\nissues; (ii) prior Beicang WWT plant operations start, (a) construction of pipes necessary for raw\nsewage collection will have been completed; and (b) a landfill facility within the Xianyang Road\nWWT plant will be operating; (iii) remedial measures are undertaken to minimize odor from the\nBeicang  WWT  plant,  including  source  control;  and  (iv)  internationally  acceptable  practices  are\nused  during  construction  of  the  Beicang  WWT  plant  and  related  project  facilities  to  minimize\nnegative environmental impacts, including measures for dust reduction, provision of storm runoff\ndetention ponds, and controlled disposal of waste soil and, wherever possible, use of trenchless\nmethods for necessary pipe-laying.\n\n\f33\n\nindustrial  pollution  sources\n143.  TMG  will  ensure \nmanagement  program  requiring  industries  to  improve  pretreatment  of  wastewater  to  satisfy\nnational wastewater discharge standards.\n\nimplementation  of \n\ntimely \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n3.\n\nCounterpart Funding\n\n144.  The  Government,  through  TMG,  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  local  and  foreign  currency\ncounterpart  financing  necessary  for  the  Project,  including  equity  contributions  and  cash\nadvances,  is  provided  in  time  to  enable  completion  of  project  activities;  and  (ii)  additional\ncounterpart funding will be provided for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns.\n\n4.\n\nPerformance Framework Contracts\n\n145.  The  PIAs  will  implement  in  a  timely  manner  their  performance  framework  contracts,\nparticularly with regard to agreed strategic business and action plans relating to improvements\nin  institutional,  managerial,  operational,  personnel,  financial,  and  technological  systems,  and\nmarketing and customer relations.\n\n5.\n\nCost Recovery\n\n146.  TMG, TML, and TSC will review the tariff regimes, including for water and wastewater,\nprior to the midterm review of project implementation. The review will include (i) recalculation of\nminimum  cost  recovery  tariffs  based  on  actual  project  costs,  the  proposed  capital  investment\nprogram,  and  ongoing  Government  requirements;  (ii)  affordability  and  willingness-to-pay\nsurveys; (iii) financial and economic benefits analysis; and (iv) extension of the price escalation\nmechanism  to  household  and  commercial  users  and  other  potential  fees,  charges,  or  market-\nbased  instruments  to  encourage  water  conservation  and  sound  environmental  behavior.  The\nfindings will be submitted to ADB for review and discussion during the midterm review of project\nimplementation.\n\n147.  TMG  will  ensure  that  by  the  end  of  2005  the  wastewater  tariffs  charged  by  TSC  to  all\nwastewater  consumers  are  increased  from  the  present  levels  to  ensure  full  recovery  of  O&M,\ndepreciation,  and  financial  costs,  i.e.,  debt  service  obligations,  and  a  reasonable  profit  margin\nfor  TSC.  Thus,  TSC  will  prepare  and  submit  the  necessary  applications  for  tariff  increases  to\nGovernment authorities concerned.\n\n148.  TMG will ensure that by the end of 2005 the raw water tariffs charged to its consumers\nare increased to ensure full recovery of O&M, depreciation, and financial costs, i.e. debt service\nobligations,  and  a  reasonable  profit  margin  for  TML.  Thus,  TML  will  prepare  and  submit  the\nnecessary applications for tariff increases to Government authorities concerned.\n\n149.  TMG  will  ensure  that  no  entity  will  be  exempted  from  the  tariff  established,  granted  a\npreferential rate, or excused for delays in payments without penalties.\n\n6.\n\nTraining\n\n150.  The  PIAs  will  prepare  and  submit  their  training  plans  to  be  implemented  under  the\nProject  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence,  and  will  ensure  that  training  institutes  for  such\npurpose will be selected in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\n7.\n\nImplementation arrangements\n\n151.  TMG will ensure that TSC and TML will have full financial, operational, and managerial\nautonomy,  including  with  respect  to  staffing  decisions  and  determination  of  annual  business\nplans and financial and capital expenditure budgets.\n\n\f34\n\n152.  TSC and TML will appoint commercial auditors that are qualified to undertake company\naudits in the PRC and are acceptable to ADB and an audit committee of each board of directors\nwill be established to review internal and external audit reports and to consider other issues of\ncorporate governance.\n\n8.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n153.  TSC and TML companies will maintain (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.4:1,\n(ii) maximum debt equity ratio of 65:35, and (iii) minimum current ratio of 2:1.\n\n9.\n\nFinancial Matters\n\n154.  TSC and TML will each establish separate bank accounts and ensure that each account\nmaintains  a  minimum  balance  to  cover  one  month  of  estimated  O&M  expenditure  and,\nbeginning no later than 1 January 2004, a minimum balance sufficient to cover four months of\nestimated O&M expenditures for its operations.\n\n155.  TSC  and  TML  will  each  establish  an  account  by  1  March  2005  or  within  60  days  of\nincurring any long-term debt obligations and will ensure that the minimum balances in such an\naccount will be sufficient to cover four months of debt service obligations.\n\n156.  TSC  and  TML,  among  others,  will  ensure  that  interest  and  principal  payments  on\nshareholders  advances,  if  any,  will  be  made  from  general  cash  reserves,  excluding  cash\nmaintained in the retention account and debt service accounts.\n\nB.\n\nCondition to Loan Effectiveness\n\n157.  As a condition to loan effectiveness, the Government agrees that onlending agreements,\nin form and substance satisfactory to ADB, will have been entered into between (a) TMG and\nTSC, for Part A of the Project; and (b) TMG and TML, for Part B of the Project.\n\nC. \n\nCondition of Disbursement\n\n158.  No  disbursements  of  the  ADB  loan  for  financing  the  Water  Resources  Protection\ncomponent  of  the  Project  will  be  made  until  TML  and  China  Development  Bank  have  entered\ninto a cofinancing agreement for such purpose on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB.\n\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n\n159. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $130,000,000 to the People's Republic\nof  China  for  the  Tianjin  Wastewater  Treatment  and  Water  Resources  Protection  Project  from\nADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's pool-\nbased variable lending rate system for US dollar loans and with a term of 25 years, including a\ngrace period of 5 years, and other such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance\nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.\n\n16 November 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nProject Logical Framework\n\nAffordability Analysis\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFlow of Funds Chart\n\nFinancial Performance and Projections\n\nProject Organization Chart\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nIndicative Procurement Packages\n\nSummary Resettlement Plan\n\nFinancial Evaluation\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n36\n\n41\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\n54\n\n55\n\n59\n\n65\n\n1,3\n\n10, 43\n\n19, 80\n\n19, 82\n\n21, 88\n\n22, 91\n\n22, 93\n\n23, 95\n\n23, 96\n\n27, 118\n\n29, 123\n\n29, 124\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nADB\u2019s Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Urban, Environment, and\nWater Supply Sectors\n\nSummary Environmental Impact Assessment\n\nPublic Participation Activities\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nDraft Performance Contracts\n\nResettlement Plan\n\nLand Impacts and Land Allocation Before and After the Project\n\nDetailed Economic Analysis\n\nDetails of Financial Projections / Historical Statements\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT LOGICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nIndicators & Targets\n\nRisks/ Assumptions\n\nA.

The analysis was undertaken at current 2005 prices.\n\nEstimated  retail  bills  include  raw  water,  wastewater,  and  an  incremental  tap  water\n2.\ncharge.  Estimates  assume:  (i)  no  change  in  current  household  size,  (ii)  an  increase  in  water\nconsumption  per  capita  from  107  to  117  liters  per  day,  (iii)  implementation  of  recommended\ntariff  increases  for  wastewater  and  raw  water;  and  (iv)  no  real  increase  in  the  incremental\ncharge made by the water distribution companies. Detailed assumptions are shown in Table A2.\nThe total combined retail charge is estimated to be Y2.61/m3 (2000 prices) equivalent to\n3.\nY2.96/m3  (2005  prices).    Based  on  estimated  average  water  consumption  per  capita  and\nhousehold  size,  the  average  monthly  retail  water  bill  in  2005  is  estimated  to  be  Y28  (2000\nprices),  equivalent  to  Y32  (2005  prices).    This  represents  a  doubling  of  the  current  average\nhousehold bill in real terms.\n\nFor  the  analysis,  household  incomes  are  assumed  to  remain  constant  over  the  period.\n4.\nThis is a conservative estimate given recent growth of around 4 percent per annum. However,\nby  assuming  static  real  incomes,  the  analysis  allows  for  differential  income  growth  across\nhousehold income categories and helps to ensure that the affordability assessment is realistic\nfor the very low income categories.\n\n5.\nFor  the  mean  income  household,  the  monthly  combined  water  bill  is  Y32,  around  1.5\npercent of income.  For the poorest 5 percent of households, the monthly combined water bill is\nY35, around 4.5 percent of income.\n\n6.\nCharges  are  considered  to  be  affordable  for  all  income  levels.  Even  for  the  poorest  5\npercent  of  households,  bills  represent  less  than  5  percent  of  monthly  income,  within  the\naccepted affordability range.\n\n\fTable A2.

TSC was registered\nas  a  state-owned  enterprise  in  May  1996,  through  a  transfer  of  assets  and  staffing  from  the\nformer Sewerage Management department of the Tianjin Engineering Management Bureau.   \n\n2. \nTianjin Luanhe Drinking Water Source Protection Engineering Ltd (TML) is responsible\nfor the supply of raw water for urban Tianjin and for flood control services.  TML was registered,\nas  a  state-owned  enterprise  in  January  2000,  through  the  transfer  of  assets  and  staffing  from\nthe Luan River Diversion Management Bureau (LRDMB).\n\n3. \nTSC  and  TML  operate  and  maintain  existing  assets  required  for  the  provision  of\nwastewater and raw water supply services. Financial projections for TSC and TML are based on\nfull  cost  recovery  for  all  operations  of  the  company  including  existing  operations,  additional\nfacilities provided under the Project, and known investment plans.   \n\n4. \nFinancial projections are undertaken in current prices. International inflation is assumed\nto  be  2.4  percent  per  annum.  Domestic  inflation  is  assumed  to  be  1.8  percent  for  2000,  2.0\npercent for 2001, and 3.0 percent thereafter.\n\nB.\n\nWastewater Treatment Component\n\n1.\n\nOperating Costs\n\n5. \nCurrent  annual  operating  costs  of  TSC  are  Y138  million  ($16.7  million)  including  two\nexisting  wastewater  treatment  plants,  facilities,  equipment,  and  the  sewer  network.  Additional\noperating  costs  incurred  by  the  Project  are  estimated  by  TSC  at  Y25  million  ($3.0  million)\nannual,  including  labor,  power,  maintenance,  chemicals,  inspection  fees  and  other  costs  to\ncover  the  new  wastewater  treatment  plant,  and  the  additional  network  and  pumping  stations.\nAdditional  operating  costs  of  Y96  million  ($11.6  million)  will  be  incurred  in  2004,  to  cover\nadditional facilities not covered under the Project, including one new treatment plant (Xing Yang\nRoad due for completion in 2003), expansion of the existing treatment plant at Jizhuangxi (due\nfor  completion  in  2003),  and  associated  sewer  networks.  Operating  costs  are  assumed  to\nincrease in line with inflation.\n\n2.\n\nCapital Expenditure\n\n6. \nProject  capital  expenditure  is  estimated  at  Y343  million  ($41.4  million).  This  includes\nphysical contingencies of 10 percent for all items, and price contingencies in line with expected\ninflation. Replacement costs for mechanical equipment are included in 2014.\n\n 3.\n\nRevenues\n\n7. \nRevenues  will  come  from  direct  user  charges  and  subsidies.    Proposed  direct  charges\nfor all user types are Y1.06 ($0.13) by 2005 (2000 prices) equivalent to Y1.2 ($0.15) by 2005,\n(2005 prices). For industries where wastewater is monitored, TSC will collect revenues. For all\nother  industries,  domestic  and  other  use,  revenues  will  be  collected  by  the  water  distribution\ncompany,  which  will  charge  2  percent  commission.  Charges  will  be  based  on  100  percent  of\nwater  supplied  and  no  industry  or  activity  will  be  exempt  from  charges.  Annual  wastewater\nvolumes, at 417 million m3, are expected to rise at an average of 2 percent per annum.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nThe  storm  water  subsidy  of  Y34  million  ($4.1  million)  will  continue  as  a  storm  water\n8. \ndrainage charge to TMG, reflecting the \u201cpublic good\u201d that the service provides. The charge will\nremain constant in real terms.  The sewerage subsidy of Y5 million ($0.6 million) will cease in\n2000.  The  sewage  treatment  subsidy  will  be  phased  out.  The  subsidy  is  assumed  to  halve  in\n2000  and  cease  in  2003,  allowing  tariffs  to  increase  at  a  politically  acceptable  rate,  which  is\nnecessary for successful project implementation.\n\n4.\n\nBalance Sheet Assumptions\n\nThe opening balance is based on TSC balance sheet for 1998. Total current assets are\n9. \nY103 million ($12.4 million). Gross fixed assets are Y1,361 million ($164.4 million), accumulated\ndepreciation Y50 million ($6.0 million), and net fixed assets in operation Y1,311 million ($158.3\nmillion).\n\nOpening balance of the capital account was assumed to be the same as the value of net\n\n10. \nfixed assets in operation.\n\n11. \nProject  fixed  assets  are  depreciated  at  4  percent  per  annum  on  a  declining  balance.\nExisting assets are depreciated at a composite index of 3.1 percent per annum, on the basis of\na detailed analysis of specific items in the asset register. Assets to be transferred to the TSC in\nthe future are depreciated at 2.5 percent per annum.\n\n12. \n\nAccounts receivable represent 15 percent of current period debit.\n\nAccounts  payable  represent  10  percent  of  operating  expenses.  Seventy  percent  of\n\n13. \nadditions to accounts payable are paid in the following year.\n\n14. \n\nThe allowance for doubtful debts represents 5 percent of current period debit.\n\n15. \nLong term debt includes the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan, of Y217 million ($26.2\nmillion) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital reserves, which carries an interest rate of 6.42 percent per\nannum, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a 1 percent front end fee. The loan is repaid\nover 25 years with a grace period of 5 years.\n\nProvision for foreign exchange and interest risk is included as part of debt service at an\n\n16. \nadditional 5 percentage points over the prevailing interest rate of 6.42 percent.\n\n17. \nNonoperational  revenue  is  based  on  the  1999  TSC  profit  and  loss  statement,  at  Y10\nmillion  ($1.2  million)  representing  profits  on  construction.  It  is  assumed  to  remain  constant  in\nreal terms.\n\n18. \n\nInterest on cash balance is 4 percent per annum.\n\nTSC  will  be  exempt  from  business  income  tax  until  2005.  From  2006,  income  tax  is\n\n19. \nassumed at 33 percent of net revenue.\n\nTSC  will  review  financial  performance  on  a  yearly  basis  and  assess  appropriate  tariff\n20. \nlevels to achieve full cost recovery, considering items including revenue collection performance,\nactual costs, and investment plans.\n\n5.\n\nProjected Financial Statements\n\n21. \nDetailed  financial  projections  up  to  the  year  2015  have  been  prepared  for  TSC.\nProjections  cover  the  wastewater  management  operations  as  proposed  under  the  Project,\nexisting operations, and the new facilities under construction. The projected financial statements\nare presented in current prices that include inflation in each year.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\nTotal assets are seen to increase from Y1.4 billion ($0.17 billion) in 2000 to Y6.2 billion\n22. \n($0.75 billion) in 2015 as a result of growth in retained earnings from operations and the transfer\nof assets. Sufficient cash is generated to be able to pay all debt service requirements.\n\n23. \nOn the basis of the proposed charges, and subsidies in the first two years, TSC will run\nat a small profit over the projection period. Profits (measured by return on capital employed) in\nthe  early  years  are  low,  rise  to  reach  8  percent  in  2003,  as  tariff  increases  take  place.  Profit\nlevels fall to 2 percent in 2004. This is the result of the additional expenditure required to cover\nthe operations and maintenance of additional facilities from 2004. Profit levels slowly increase to\nreach  8  percent  by  2015.  These  profit  levels  are  considered  to  be  reasonable,  in  conjunction\nwith PRC guidelines.1\n\nC.\n\nWater Resources Protection Component\n\n1.\n\nOperating Costs\n\n24. \nCurrent operating costs of facilities and raw water delivery is estimated at Y218 million\n($26.3  million).  This  includes  raw  water  purchase,  operation  and  maintenance  of  reservoirs,\ntunnel, administration of the bureau and monitoring and covers all labor, power, equipment and\nother costs. Additional operating costs associated with the Project are Y25 million ($3.0 million).\n\n25. \nCapital  expenditure  under  the  Project  is  estimated  at  Y2.2  billion  ($0.27  billion).  TML\ndoes  not  have  any  specific  long-term  investment  plans,  thus  no  specific  investments  or\nadditional costs are included in the financial projections.\n\n2.\n\nCapital Costs\n\n3.\n\nRevenues\n\n26. \nRevenues  will  come  from  direct  charges.  Proposed  direct  charges  for  raw  water\nconsumed are Y0.75 ($0.09) by 2005 (2000 prices) equivalent to Y0.85 ($0.10)/cubic meter (m3)\nby 2005, (2005 prices), and Y0.25 ($0.03) by 2005 (2000 prices) equivalent to Y0.28 ($0.03)/m3\nby 2005 (2005 prices), for industries that recycle water. TML will collect charges from the water\ndistribution  companies  for  consumed  water  and  will  charge  users  directly  for  recycled  water.\nAnnual consumption of water is projected to rise from 537 million m3 in 2000 to 748 million m3\nby 2020, an average growth rate of about 1.7 percent per annum. Demand for recycled water\nused primarily by the power plants, steel works, and paper mill is expected to remain constant at\n415 million m3 per annum.\n\n27. \nNo  specific  subsidies  are  included  for  flood  control  services  provided  by  TML.  No\ninformation regarding the costs of flood control as an operation is available and it has not been\npossible to determine an appropriate charge for the activity. Rather, flood control is an integral\npart of raw water provision, and as such is a positive economic externality of the operation.\n\n4.\n\nBalance Sheet Assumptions\n\n28. \n\nAll assets of LRDMB are transferred to TML in the year 2000.\n\nThe  opening  balance,  at  the  end  of  1999,  is  based  on  asset  valuations  provided  by\n29. \nLRDMB,  adjusted  for  inflation  and  assuming  60  percent  accumulated  depreciation.  Net  fixed\nassets in operation are Y717 million ($86.6 million).\n\nThe opening balance of the capital account was assumed to be the same as the value of\n\n30. \nnet fixed assets in operation.\n\n                                                \n1 State Circular 1192, issued by SPDC, MOF, and SEPA in September 1999.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nProject fixed assets and existing assets are depreciated at 2.5 percent per annum on a\n31. \ndeclining balance. The rate is low since the assets are primarily civil works with a long economic\nlife.  The  diversion  management  department  assets  are  depreciated  at  5  percent,  since  these\nassets include noncivil works items, including vehicles.   \n\n32. \n\nAccounts receivable represent 15 percent of current period debit.\n\nAccounts  payable  represent  10  percent  of  operating  expenses.  Seventy  percent  of\n\n33. \nadditions to accounts payable are paid in the following year.\n\n34. \n\nThe allowance for doubtful debts represents 5 percent of current period debit.\n\n35. \nLong-term  debt  includes  the  ADB  loan,  of  Y859  million  ($103.7  million)  from  ADB\u2019s\nordinary  capital  reserves,  and  a  loan  from  China  Development  Bank  of  Y727  million  ($87.8\nmillion). The ADB loan carries an interest rate of 6.42 percent per annum, a commitment charge\nof  0.75  percent  and  a  1  percent  front  end  fee.  The  loan  is  repaid  over  25  years  with  a  grace\nperiod of 5 years. The China Development Bank loan carries an interest rate of 6.21 percent per\nannum. The loan is repaid over 15 years, with a grace period of 5 years.\n\nProvision for foreign exchange and interest risk is included as part of debt service at an\n\n36. \nadditional 5 percentage points over the prevailing interest rate of 6.42 percent.\n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nNonoperational income is 3 percent of operating revenues.\n\nInterest on cash balance is 4 percent per annum.\n\nTML  will  be  exempt  from  business  income  tax  until  2005.  From  2006,  income  tax  is\n\n39. \nassumed at 33 percent of net revenue.\n\nTML  will  review  financial  performance  on  a  yearly  basis  and  assess  appropriate  tariff\n40. \nlevels to achieve full cost recovery, considering items including revenue collection performance,\nactual costs, and investment plans.\n\n5.\n\nProjected Financial Statements\n\n41. \nDetailed  financial  projections  up  to  the  year  2015  have  been  prepared  for  TML.\nProjections cover existing raw water supply operations and additional facilities proposed under\nthe  Project.  The  projected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  current  prices  that  include\ninflation in each year.\n\n42. \nTotal assets are seen to increase from Y0.8 billion ($0.10 billion) in 2000 to Y4.8 billion\n($0.58  billion)  in  2015.  Sufficient  cash  is  generated  to  be  able  to  pay  all  debt  service\nrequirements.\n\n43. \nOn the basis of the proposed charges, TML will run at a small profit over the projection\nperiod.  Profits  increase  gradually  over  the  period.  In  the  years  of  implementation  and  up  to\n2010, average profit levels measured by return on capital employed are less than 6 percent, in\nline with People\u2019s Republic of China guidelines.2 After this period, profits rise gradually.\n\n                                                \n2 Reasonable profit for raw water provision is designated to 4-6 percent.

It  also\nincorporates  the  discussion  on  resettlement  with  the  relevant  agencies  carried  out  during\nappraisal. The RP was prepared on the basis of the feasibility designs. As a condition for loan\neffectiveness,  the  RP  will  be  revised  and  updated  when  the  preliminary  technical  design  is\nfinalized. The revised RP will be submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) prior to land\nclearing, and will include livelihood restoration plans. A detailed socioeconomic survey has been\ncompleted.\n\n2. \nThe  Tianjin  Municipal  Development  Planning  Commission,  in  collaboration  with  Tianjin\nSewerage  Company,  the  Tianjin  Luanhe  Drinking  Water  Source  Protection  Engineering  Ltd,\nother  relevant  agencies,  and  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultants,  was\nresponsible for preparing the RP, and ensuring that the requirements of the Asian Development\nBank  (policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good\nPractice) are met.\n\nB.\n\nLand Acquisition, Land Use, and Resettlement\n\n3. \nProject impacts have been identified by a preliminary survey that was undertaken during\nOctober 1999 to January 2000.  Thus, resettlement impacts and budget are estimates and will\nbe revised in light of the preliminary technical design. As a result of permanent land acquisition\nof 4.29 million square meters (m2), over 3,360 people or 940 households will be affected in 125\nvillages and one district (45 around the reservoir and 80 for the upgrade of the upgrade of the\nchannel  and  the  Zhou  River  diversion  channel,  and  Beichang  District).  Temporary  land\nacquisition  of  5.51  million  m2  will  affect  over  6,370  persons  or  1,591  households.  Physical\nrelocation  of  12  households,  with  56  affected  persons  (APs)  is  expected.  No  community\nstructures or public institutions will be affected by the Project.\n\n4. \n\nTable A10.1 gives details of land impacts resulting from the project.\n\nTable A10.1: Land Impacts\n(\u2018000 m2)\n\nPermanent Land\nImpact\n\nTemporary Land\nImpact\n\nProject Structure/Component\n\nA.

Economic activities are\ngenerally  restricted  by  environmental  regulations.  Some  villages  have  lost  most  of  their  land\nalready  to  the  reservoir,  and  are  provided  with  a  subsidy  for  food  and  fuel.  Incomes  are\nsupplemented  by  other  occupations,  such  as  service-related  activities  and  transportation,  and\nindustrial  enterprises.  Several  villages  subsist  mainly  on  fishing  in  the  reservoir.  Due  to  the\nrelatively  small  parcels  of  land  being  acquired  in  each  village,  most  households  will  not\nexperience a major impact from land acquisition. Land impacts (permanent and temporary) and\nland allocation per capita before and after the Project are given as a supplementary appendix. A\nlivelihood restoration program will review options and develop viable employment activities that\nare permitted by environmental regulations, particularly in villages that have low land per capita\nratios. The options will include\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nland development;\nagricultural intensification;\nenterprise development; and\nself-employment by APs, with provision for start-up capital.\n\nD.\n\nCompensation and Entitlements\n\n6. \nThe  compensation  fees  and  entitlements  are  based  on  laws  and  regulations  of  the\nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  ADB  guidelines  and  policies  relating  to  resettlement.  The\nwastewater treatment component is governed by the 1998 Land Administration Law. The water\nresource component is governed by the 1991 Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) Regulations\non  Medium  and  Large  Hydropower  Project  Construction.  Since  MWR  is  revising  these\nregulations,  any  changes  will  be  incorporated,  as  necessary,  in  the  revised  RP.  All  APs,  legal\nand  illegal land users, will be eligible for compensation. Compensation for nonland assets will\nbe made at full replacement rates.\n\nE.\n\nPublic Information, Consultation, Grievance, and Appeal\n\n7. \nDuring  the  impact  survey  and  planning  of  resettlement,  consultations  were  undertaken\nwith  town  and  township  leaders.  Interviews  and  informal  discussions  have  been  held  in  the\naffected  towns  and  villages.  The  revised  RP  will  include  plans  for  livelihood  restoration,\ndeveloped  in  close  consultation  with  APs,  and  fully  disclosed  to  them.  The  revised  RP  will  be\nfully  translated  into  Chinese  and  provided  to  APs  at  least  two  months  before  ground  leveling\nand  construction  commence.  The  project  implementation  agencies  (PIAs)  will  address  any\nconcerns  raised  by  APs.  Consultation  sessions  will  be  held  with  APs  to  fully  explain\nresettlement entitlements, including the compensation rates. The final RP will be available at the\noffice  of  the  village  committee  in  all  project-affected  areas,  and  the  revised  RP  will  take  into\nconsideration all comments received. The PIAs placed the SRP in the affected township offices\nfor review by the APs prior to loan negotiations. A comments register, both verbal and written,\nwill be kept by township resettlement offices. The RP consultation plan is shown in Table A10.2.\nGrievances may be expressed verbally to the local village committee or more formally by letter\nto higher authorities at county and municipal level land management bureau. APs if dissatisfied\nwith  the  administrative  resolution  of  their  dispute  may  also  appeal  to  the  people\u2019s  court.  A  full\ndescription of the grievance procedure and timescales involved are contained in the RP.\n\n\fTable A10.2: Public Participation Plan\n\nTiming\n\n15 June\nJuly 2000\n\nImplementing\nAgencies\n\nCounty\nresettlement office,\nvillage committee\n\nTarget\nParticipants\nAll project\nAPs\n\nRemarks\n\n(cid:1)  meetings to be held in each county\n\nPurpose of Event\n\nInformation briefing on the\nproject and resettlement issues\nto elicit comments on project\nfrom affected persons (APs).\n\nForm of\nEvent\nDisplay of\nresettlement\nplan (RP) at\ntownship\nlevel\n\nInform project beneficiaries of\nproject progress, final design,\nand project timing, consult with\nAPs on livelihood activities for\ninclusion in the revised RP.\n\nCommunity\nmeetings\nand focus\ngroup\ndiscussions\n\nDisplay summary RP on website Global\n\n15 June 2000\n\nGlobal\n\nAPs\n\nAsian Development\nBank\nProject\nimplementation\nagencies, county\nresettlement office,\nand village\ncommittee\n\nDuring\npreliminary\ntechnical\ndesign and\nprior to loan\neffectiveness\n(Oct-Nov\n2000)\nJan 2001\n\nPresent and elicit comments on\nthe revised RP\n\nVillage committee\n\nAll project\nAPs\n\nFinal inventory and census\n\nDec 2000-\nJan 2001\n\nCounty\nresettlement office,\nvillage committee\n\nAll project\nAPs\n\nAdvise APs of entitlements and\ndisbursement of compensation\n\nJan-Feb 2001\n\nMonitoring of APs, project\nbeneficiaries, and health\nimpacts.\n\nHousehold\nmeetings\n\nJune 2001-\nJune 2005\n\nAll project\nAPs\n\nRandom\nsample\n\nCounty\nresettlement office,\nvillage committee\nCounty\nresettlement office,\nvillage committee,\nand independent\nexternal monitor\n\nCommunity\nmeetings\nand focus\ngroup\ndiscussions\n\nIndividual\ninterviews,\nhousehold\ninterviews\nPublic\nmeetings\n\n(cid:1)  AP input into livelihood activities\n(cid:1) \n\nIdentify training requirements for Aps\n\nIdentify \u201cgaps\u201d in RP\n\n(cid:1)  Distribution of the draft RP before event\n(cid:1)  Discuss concerns relating to RP\n(cid:1) \n(cid:1)  Undertake focus group discussions with\nvarious occupations, age groups, and\nwomen to elicit specific concerns\n(cid:1) \nInventory all assets and land holdings\n(cid:1)  Collect additional socioeconomic data\n\n(cid:1)  Household meetings to outline\n\nentitlements\n\n(cid:1) \n\nIdentify where additional support is\nrequired particularly for vulnerable and\ndisadvantaged groups\n\n(cid:1)  Provide recommendations and update\n\nRP monitoring plan\nIdentify health improvements\n\n(cid:1) \n(cid:1)  Assess project beneficiaries\u2019 ability to\n\npay tariff and satisfaction with water and\nwastewater service.\n\n5\n7\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n0\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n\n \n\n3\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nF.\n\nOrganization, Implementation, and Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n8. \nThe PIAs and the county resettlement office will be responsible for implementing the RP.\nImplementation at the local level is the responsibility of county and township governments and\nvillage  committees  of  the  affected  areas.  Implementation  of  the  RP  will  be  monitored  by  the\nPIAs.  The  PIAs  will  brief  all  resettlement  staff  fully  on  the  contents  of  the  RP  prior  to\nimplementation.  During  RP  implementation,  internal  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  every  six\nweeks.  Post  resettlement  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  internally  by  the  PIAs  every  three\nmonths. External monitoring will be undertaken annually for two years after resettlement and will\ninclude a socioeconomic survey of at least 15 percent of affected families in villages affected by\nland acquisition and those affected by house relocation.  Data will be disaggregated by gender,\nand attention will be given to vulnerable groups. The aim is to ascertain whether the Project has\nmet the resettlement objectives of providing equal or better livelihoods and living standards. An\ninternational  specialist  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  engaged  to  help  develop  a\nresettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  a  methodology  for  the  socioeconomic\nassessments.  The  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  pay  particular  attention  to\nlivelihood restoration. At the end of each monitoring exercise, a report will be submitted to the\nPIAs, who will forward a copy to ADB.\n\nG.\n\nCost Estimates and Flow of Resettlement Funds\n\nThe  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including  monitoring  and  evaluation,  is\n9. \npart  of  the  project  cost  and  has  been  included  in  the  project  cost  estimates.  The  PIA  will  be\nresponsible  for  arranging  the  resettlement  financing  and  for  negotiating  with  the  APs.  Tianjin\nMunicipal  Government  will  guarantee  to  meet  any  budget  shortfall  required  to  meet  the  RP\nobjectives,  including  any  changes  approved  to  the  1991  MWR  Regulations  on  Medium  and\nLarge Hydropower Project Construction. PIA will ensure the compensation and other specified\nassistance  is  provided  in  full,  on  time,  and  directly  to  the  APs  and  their  collectives.  The\nresettlement  funds  will  be  will  be  provided  to  village  committees,  enterprises  offering  job\nopportunities, the APs to be resettled, and other agencies involved in resettlement management\nand  administration.  Entitlements  will  be  provided  to  the  APs  before  demolition  and  ground\nleveling commence.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL EVALUATION\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFinancial viability was assessed for each of the project components by comparing (i) the\n1. \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  based  on  incremental  revenue  generation,  with  the\nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC);  and  (ii)  the  average  incremental  financial  revenue\n(AIFR) with the average incremental financial cost (AIFC).  A series of sensitivity tests were also\nundertaken.  All figures shown are in constant 2000 prices, unless otherwise stated.\n\n2. \nCost  recovery  is  based  on  tariffs  required  for  financial  sustainability  of  the  project\nagencies,  Tianjin  Sewerage  Company  (TSC)  and  Tianjin  Luanhe  Drinking  Water  Source\nProtection Engineering Ltd (TML).\n\n3. \nAffordability  analysis  was  undertaken  for  combined  wastewater  and  water  tariffs,  by\ncomparing  monthly  bills  with  household  income  levels,  including  the  5  percent  of  residents\nestimated to be poor.\n\nB.\n\nWastewater Treatment Component\n\n1.\n\nCosts\n\n4. \nCosts  include  capital  expenditures  related  to  the  Project  in  the  year  they  are  incurred,\nincluding  physical  contingencies  but  excluding  price  contingencies.  Operations  and\nmaintenance costs include labor, equipment, power, and other costs, based on estimates from\nTSC.  Replacement costs for mechanical and electrical equipment are included every 10 years.\nAll  components  are  assumed  to  have  a  life  of  20  years  except  for  civil  works,  which  are\nassumed to have a life of 40 years.\n\n2.\n\nIncremental Revenue\n\n5. \nIncremental revenues were calculated for the Project, using proposed incremental tariff\nincreases in constant 2000 prices and wastewater flow projections for the Beicang service area.\nSince  the  capacity  of  the  treatment  plant  is  100,000m3/day,  this  volume  is  taken  as  the\nmaximum for incremental revenue calculations. It is assumed that revenues will be realized in\nline with the proposed schedule for introducing charges.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Viability\n\n6. \nThe WACC is calculated at 4.9 percent, discounting at international inflation rates for the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) loan portion, and assuming a 6 percent real return on equity for\nTianjin  Municipal  Government  (TMG).  The  FIRR  is  calculated  at  10.7  percent,  based  on  a  5\nyear implementation period and a 20 year operating period.\n\nTable A11.1 summarizes the results of the analysis and sensitivity tests.  The base-case\n7. \nFIRR  exceeds  the  WACC  by  around  5  percentage  points,  indicating  that  the  Project  is\nfinancially  viable.    This  margin  is  necessary,  since  tariff  revenues  are  also  required  to  pay  for\nother  operations  of  TSC.  Sensitivity  tests  show  that  the  Project  remains  viable  under  adverse\ncost, revenue and exchange rate assumptions.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nTable A11.1: Wastewater Treatment Component, Summary Results of FIRR Analysis\nSensitivity\nIndicator\n\nFIRR\n\nBase Case\n\nCosts Increase by 10%\n\nRevenues Reduce by 10%\n\nCosts Increase by 10% and  Revenues Reduce by 10%\n\nExchange Rate Devaluation of 30 %\n\n1.8\n2.0\n\n10.7\n8.7\n\n8.5\n\n6.6\n\n7.5\n\n8.5\n\nRevenues delayed by one year\nNote: The  sensitivity  indicator  measures  the  proportionate  decrease  in  the  FIRR  as  costs  increase  or  revenues\n\ndecrease.\n\nAIFC and AIFR were calculated by discounting annual capital investment and operation\n8. \ncosts,  and  incremental  revenues,  at  the  WACC.

Average monthly retail water bills\nin 2005 are estimated to be Y28, double the estimated current bill of Y14. Estimated retail bills\ninclude raw water, wastewater, and an incremental tap water charge.\n\n19. \nCharges are considered to be affordable for all income levels including the 5 percent of\nthe population considered to be poor. For an average income household, estimated combined\nwater  bills  represent  around  1.5  percent  of  income.  Even  for  the  poorest  5  percent  of\nhouseholds,  estimated  bills  represent  less  than  5  percent  of  monthly  income,  within  the\naccepted affordability range.\n\n20. \n\nTables A11.5 and

resources management, which constrains the development potential of the city. Tianjin is\npart  of  the  heavily  polluted  Hai  River  Basin,  one  of  three  river  basins  designated  for  intense\nplanning  and  project  implementation  to  address  environmental  damage,  under  the  national\nTranscentury  Green  Plan.  The  Hai  River  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Plan  (HRPPCP)\nidentifies Tianjin as one of four priority cities requiring urgent attention, and requires that water\nin  rivers  meets  class  V  standards1  and  that  drinking  water  sources  meet  designated  national\nquality standards.\n\n1.\n\nWastewater Treatment\n\n2. \nTianjin  lacks  a  comprehensive  wastewater  management  system.  The  existing  sewage\nnetwork  is  overloaded  and  less  than  50  percent  of  wastewater  is  treated.  Currently,  most\nsewage  is  discharged  into  the  nearest  watercourse,  polluting  the  environment,  causing\nenvironmental damage, and threatening public health. Most of the rivers currently fail to reach\nclass  V  water  quality  standards,  well  below  the  national  objective  set  out  in  the  HRPPCP.  In\naddition, the water quality in Bohai Bay is deteriorating with consequent damage to the marine\nenvironment  and  the  incidence  of  red  tide  has  increased,  causing  damage  to  the  marine\nindustry and aquaculture.\n\nThe wastewater treatment (WWT) component forms part of the wastewater management\n3. \nplan for the city drawn up to address these problems and to enable Tianjin to meet the quality\nstandards set out in the HRPPCP. Other wastewater projects financed by agencies such as the\nWorld Bank and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), are also planned in the city.\nThe component fits well in the plan, is prioritized and well sequenced vis-\u00e0-vis the other related\nprojects.\n\n2.\n\nWater Resources Protection\n\nTianjin is heavily reliant for water supply on raw water transferred from the Luan River\n4. \nusing  the  Luan  River  Diversion  (LRD)  system  via  the  Yuqiao  Reservoir.  The  quality  of  water\ndelivered to water treatment works consistently fails to meet the minimum class III (footnote 1)\nwater quality standard required under the national guidelines. Investment is urgently required for\nTianjin\u2019s water source to meet the standards required by law and to ensure that the raw water\nsupply  consistently  continues  to  meet  these  standards  in  the  future.  The  water  resources\nprotection  component  will  improve  the  water  quality  in  the  Yuqiao  Reservoir  and  in  the\ndownstream water courses and restore the quality of the water supplied to the treatment works,\nto  meet  national  guidelines.  In  addition  the  component  will  help  guard  against  future  risks  to\nwater  contamination  and  enable  the  water  authority  to  guarantee  the  delivery  of  water  at  the\nrequired quality standards.\n\n                                                \n1 The Class III standard is one of five classes. Class I, the highest standard, is for water supply sources with limited\ntreatment and national natural reserves. Class II and III are for fishing and recreation, and may be used as water\nsupply  sources  where  full  treatment  is  employed.  Class  IV  is  suitable  for  industrial  uses  and  non-contact\nrecreational uses. The Class V standard is designated for agricultural uses and scenic viewing.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n3.\n\nMethodology and Approach\n\n5. \nThe  analysis  establishes  the  economic  rationale,  describes  beneficiaries,  sets  out  the\n\u201cwithout Project situation,\u201d assesses the need and demand for each component, and undertakes\nan  analysis  of  alternatives.  The  analysis  compares  the  calculated  economic  internal  rate  of\nreturn  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  and  each  component  to  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital\n(EOCC),  which  is  assumed  to  be  12  percent.  The  analysis  also  includes  an  assessment  of\nnonvalued  factors,  which  are  particularly  important  for  environmental  projects,  given  the\ndifficulties  of  valuing  benefits.  The  analysis  uses  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  since  benefits\nare nontradeable in nature. The analysis was done in constant 2000 prices. Detailed economic\nanalysis is available as Supplementary Appendix F.\n\nB.\n\nWastewater Treatment Component\n\n1.\n\nComponent Beneficiaries\n\n6. \nDirect component beneficiaries include the 60 existing industries and 200,000 residents\nof the Beicang service area, and the new industries and an estimated 800,000 future residents\nthat  choose  to  locate  there.  Indirect  beneficiaries  include  users  of  drainage  water  and  the\nYongdingxin  River  for  irrigation  and  all  residents  of  Tianjin  who  experience  environmental\nbenefits  from  a  reduction  in  pollution.  Most  importantly,  since  the  Beicang  area  is  a  planned\narea for economic growth and expansion, the component will remove what would otherwise be\na  constraint  to  economic  growth.  Therefore  residents  are  also  indirect  beneficiaries  through\nimproved wealth and employment effects resulting from economic growth.\n\n2.\n\nThe \u201cWithout Project\u201d Situation\n\n7. \nUnder the \u201cWithout Project\u201d scenario (i) the Beicang east area will suffer from the public\nhealth  risks,  odor,  and  amenity  problems  associated  with  the  lack  of  a  sewer  system;  and  (ii)\ndevelopment in the Beicang area will not happen at the planned pace and the economic growth\nin the component area will be constrained, leading to a lower overall growth rate for Tianjin than\nwould occur if the Project went ahead.\n\n3.\n\nDemand for Wastewater Services\n\n8. \nDemand  assessment  is  based  on  previous  work  conducted  under  the  project\npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  This  work  established  the  need  and  demand  for  the\ncomponent,  from  existing  and  potential  residents  and  industries.  The  social  survey  found  that\nresidents ranked environmental improvements as a top priority to improve their quality of life.\n\n4.\n\nAnalysis of Alternatives for Wastewater Services\n\n9. \nProject  alternatives  were  considered  at  the  feasibility  stage.  For  the  WWT  plant  this\nincluded  the  type  of  treatment  process  used  and  location.  Two  alternative  processes  were\nconsidered.  The  aerobic/oxic  (A/O)  dephosphorization  process  was  chosen  as  the  preferred\noption since (i) operation and maintenance costs were lower, (ii) Tianjin Municipal Government\n(TMG) staff have experience with the A/O process, and (iii) the plant requires less land.\n\n10. \nFor the sewerage system, alternative layouts and main diameters were considered. The\nlarger diameter pipe system was chosen over the smaller piper system since it was marginally\ncheaper. In addition, local expertise is knowledgeable about the use of large pipe systems and\nthe larger pipe diameter offers more flexibility for future capacity.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\n5.\n\nEconomic Rate of Return Analysis\n\na.\n\nCosts\n\n11. \nTaxes  are  excluded  for  all  costs  except  land  at  a  rate  of  3.41  percent  for  local  costs.\nSince  the  analysis  is  undertaken  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  tradable  items  were\nmultiplied  by  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF),  which  is  assumed  to  be  1.11.2  The\neconomic opportunity cost of land was considered. The next best alternative use of the land for\nthe WWT plant is assumed to be industrial, given surrounding uses. The cost of the land on the\nindustrial Tianjin Economic Development Area, which lies outside the city, is about Y119.94 per\nsquare meter (m2) which is 51 percent of the estimated cost per m2 for the wastewater treatment\nplant site, and 80 percent of the cost estimated for pumping stations. The conversion factors for\nland are assumed to be 0.51 and 0.8 respectively.\n\n12. \nA conversion rate of 0.8 is applied to unskilled labor since there is considerable surplus\nlabor in many state industries. No conversion factor is applied to skilled labor. Economic costs\nare phased over the planning period of the Project, which is assumed to be 25 years.\n\nb.\n\nBenefits\n\n13. \nThe  component  will  provide  direct  benefits  to  users  and  reduce  the  health  risks,  odor,\nand  environmental  damage  that  would  otherwise  occur.  The  approximate  reduction  of\nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD) suspended solids in the component area is 23 tons per day,\nequivalent  to  8,395  tons  per  year.  It  will  also  provide  indirect  benefits  to  the  central  Beicang\nsubarea through alleviating the overloading of the sewerage system that currently occurs.\n\nThe  health  and  environmental  benefits  of  the  component  are  difficult  to  value.\n14. \nWillingness  to  pay  for  wastewater  tends  to  be  undervalued,  since  the  benefits  are  largely\nunseen. The social survey showed a relatively low willingness to pay for the service, about an\nadditional Y2.2 per month than is currently being paid. This value is considered to considerably\nunderstate the true willingness to pay, and is not used in the valuation of benefits. Health data\ndoes not provide reliable estimates of illness or disease associated with the lack of wastewater\nmanagement. The environmental benefits are valued using the incremental tariff revenue for the\nservice area of Beicang, which acts as a proxy for the value of environmental improvements.\n\n15. \nThe irrigation potential of effluent from the WWT plant provides an additional economic\nbenefit.  The  effluent  would  provide  irrigation  water  to  the  nearby  farms,  during  the  dry  period\nwhen the rivers run dry and there is little water available for irrigation. What water could be used\nwill therefore be in demand and can thus be considered as an additional economic benefit. The\npotential  land  area  that  could  be  irrigated  is  estimated  at  3.67  million  m2.  The  net  additional\noutput is valued at Y22 million per year, when the wastewater treatment plant is running at full\ncapacity.\n\nd.\n\nNonvalued Benefits\n\n16. \nThe component offers economic growth benefits that are not encapsulated in the EIRR\ncalculation.  The  Project  facilitates  the  development  of  a  new  growth  area  of  the  city,  where\nindustry  and  housing  will  be  located.  Without  the  Project,  some  of  this  new  development  will\nlocate  elsewhere in  Tianjin,  but  some of the investment and growth will either happen later or\nnot  occur.  Thus  this  incremental  economic  growth  effect  should  be  considered  an  economic\nbenefit providing employment, wealth generation, and poverty reduction effects.\n\n                                                \n2 The  SERF  is  the  reciprocal  of  the  standard  conversion  factor  SCF,  which  is  estimated  to  be  0.1.  Therefore  the\n\nSERF is estimated at 1.11. See Supplementary Appendix E for a more detailed discussion.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nThe  component  provides  wastewater  facilities  for  all  residents  of  the  Beicang  service\n17. \narea regardless of income. In fact, since the poor and lower income household are (i) less able\nto afford health services, and (ii) more likely to live in poorly maintained housing close to open\nsewers,  they  are  more  at  risk  from  the  negative  impacts  under  the  current  situation  and  will\nbenefit more than the average person under the Project. Sewer connections are provided and\nincluded  in  costs  of  the  component,  thus  low-income  residents  are  not  excluded.  Including\nsewer connections also helps to reduce the risk of benefits not being realized.\n\ne.\n\nResults\n\n18. \nSensitivity assumptions are taken to be 10 percent. Table A12.1 summarizes the results\nof the EIRR analysis and the sensitivity tests and Table A12.2 (page 72) shows the calculation.\nThe base case EIRR is 15.2, percent exceeding the EOCC of 12 percent. Sensitivity tests show\nthat costs would have to increase by 19 percent and benefits would have to fall by 16 percent\nfor the EIRR only falls below the EOCC. The EIRR falls below the EOCC under the sensitivity\ntests where costs increase by 10 percent and benefits decrease by 10 percent. However, these\nevents are considered unlikely. The component is economically viable since the EIRR exceeds\nthe EOCC and the component also demonstrates other additional nonvalued benefits.\n\nTable A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests\n\nBase Case\n\nCosts Increase by 10%\n\nBenefits Reduce by 10%\n\nCosts Increase by 10% and benefits \n\nReduce by 10%\n\nBenefits Delayed by 1 Year\n\nSensitivity\nIndicator\n\nSwitching\nValue\n\n0.89\n\n0.96\n\n19%\n\n16%\n\nEIRR\n\n15.2%\n\n13.4%\n\n13.3%\n\n11.5%\n\n12.5%\n\nC.\n\nWater Resources Protection Component\n\n1.\n\nComponent Beneficiaries\n\nBeneficiaries are the water users or end customers of the LRD system. This includes a\n19. \nindustries,  and  commercial\npopulation  of  approximately  5  million  people, \nestablishments.  Water  is  also  a  necessity  for  many  of  the  industries  along  the  Hai  River,\nparticularly  the  power  plants,  which  use  the  water  for  cooling  and  recycle  it.  Water  supply\ncompanies will benefit from an improvement in the quality of their raw material, which is likely to\nresult in cost savings in traditional treatment, and a reduction in water losses from flushing and\nbackwashing.  In  addition  farmers  living  near  the  Zhou  River  will  benefit  through  land  being\nbrought back into agricultural production.\n\ninstitutions, \n\n2.\n\nThe \u201cWithout Project\u201d Situation\n\n20. \n\u201cWithout the Project,\u201d the raw water supply for Tianjin will not meet the current required\nnational standards for water supply. Nor is it likely to meet these standards in the future. Due to\nthe recent increase in pollution, the water quality is likely to deteriorate further. Since there is no\nalternative  water  supply,  the  \u201cwithout  Project  situation\u201d  implies  a  situation  in  which  there  is  no\ndrinking  water  supply  for  Tianjin,  resulting  in  very  severe  economic  consequences.  The\neconomic analysis assumes that the \u201cwithout Project situation\u201d is less severe and that the LRD\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\nwater is an acceptable source for the city. However, it does assume that the current problems of\npollution  continue  and  that  there  is  a  real  risk  from  contamination  of  the  drinking  water  in  the\nfuture,  which  is  required  by  Government  to  be  mitigated.  The  project  addresses  the  issue  of\nupstream  pollution  since  control  of  pollution  outside  the  scope  of  this  project  is  critical  for  this\nProject  to  achieve  expected  benefits.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  involved  in\npollution control activity through (i) a recently completed TA, (ii) a second TA under way in the\nHai River basin, and (iii) another proposed loan. As part of an integrated strategy and in close\ncoordination  with  other  funding  agencies,  the  risk  of  upstream  pollution  mitigating  the  positive\nbenefits of this Project is considered to be acceptable.\n\n3.\n\nNeed and Demand for Raw Water\n\n21. \nThe demand for raw water from the Luan-Tianjin diversion comes from industries along\nthe  Hai  River;  Tianjin  Water  Supply  Company,  which  is  the  major  water  supply  company  for\nurban Tianjin; and six other small water supply companies in the coastal and suburban areas.\nGiven the potential demand for Tianjin Municipality and supply of water from all sources (not just\nthe  Luan-Tianjin  diversion)  as  estimated  by  the  TMDPC,  for  the  municipality  demand  will\noutstrip  supply  by  2010.  This  emphasizes  the  requirement  for  new  water  sources,  primarily\nother river diversions.\n\n22. \nDomestic demand projections are based on population and households and assume an\nincrease in per capita water consumption from around 100 to 147 liters per day by 2020, which\nis  consistent  with  assumed  income  growth  and  behavioral  patterns,  and  brings  average  water\nconsumption more in line with other Asian cities.\n\nSince current water consumption is low compared to other countries there is less need\n23. \nor  scope  for  demand  management  measures  through  water  pricing.  Tariff  levels  are  currently\nvery  low  and  planned  increases  to  establish  full  cost  recovery  pricing  will  help  to  establish\ndemand  management  principles.  However,  estimated  forecasts  of  demand  indicate  that  the\nincome effect will outweigh the price effect over the project period.\n\n4.\n\nAnalysis of Alternatives for the Supply of Raw Water\n\n24. \nThree options were considered for the Zhou River diversion channel carrying water from\nYuqiao Reservoir to Juiwangzhuang Gate: an open water channel, a box culvert, and a pipeline.\nHowever, the three options do not give the same output since an open water channel does not\noffer  the  degree  of  protection  of  the  water  supply  that  the  underground  options  do.  The  open\nchannel  is  considered  as  an  alternative  because  it  would  not  guard  against  the  future  risk  of\ncontamination is a critical objective of the Project. The underground options have better safety\nand  aesthetic  values  for  the  local  residents  and  avoid  the  dis-benefits  associated  with\npermanent  division  of  agricultural  land  plots,  in  particular  access  to  land  which  makes\nimplementation easier. There are also technical engineering and environmental advantages.\n\n25. \nThe  pipeline  and  the  boxed  culvert  were  costed  in  detail  by  the  Water  Conservancy\nSurvey  and  Design  Institute.  The  boxed  culvert  option  has  been  preferred  since  it  has  all  the\nadvantages of an underground option and the lower cost.\n\n5.\n\nEconomic Rate of Return Analysis\n\na.\n\nCosts\n\nFinancial costs were converted to economic costs using the same SERF, tax rate, and\n26. \nconversion  rates  for  labor  as  for  the  wastewater  component.  The  main  costs  for  resettlement\nare for the reservoir component, where farmers and fish-farmers will be compensated for their\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 12, page 6\n\nloss  of  income  and  livelihood.  No  conversion  factors  were  applied  since  the  payments  are\nmeant to reflect reasonable losses.\n\nb.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nRaw  water  quality  will  be  improved  so  that  it  consistently  meets  the  national  standard,\n27. \nand the future quality of the water will be ensured through the adequate protection of the water\nsource and the conveyance system.\n\nThe  improvement  in  current  raw  water  quality  and  the  reduced  risk  of  future\n28. \ncontamination  will  not  be  fully  appreciated  or  experienced  by  the  end-users.  These  sorts  of\nbenefits  are  largely  \u201cinvisible\u201d  to  the  end  user  and  under  these  circumstances,  the  revealed\nwillingness to pay tends to understate the true willingness to pay. The social survey showed a\nreasonably  low  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  water  quality  at  just  under  Y3  per  month.  This\nvalue is not considered to be a true reflection, which would require a full understanding of the\npotential risks that would be averted under the Project.\n\n29. \nThe valuation of benefits uses a resource cost savings approach assuming that, at the\nvery  least,  the  standards  of  drinking  water  quality  must  be  met,  if  not  through  Government\ninvestment, then by the water distribution companies themselves. Under this situation, the water\ndistribution companies would be required to invest in some sort of advanced water treatment to\ntry to mitigate the failure of the raw water to meet the required standard.\n\n30. \nThere  are  also  benefits  from  the  Project  to  farmland  close  to  the  Zhou  River,  which\ncurrently is periodically flooded with contaminated water that cannot be released into the river\nsystem.  Approximately  400.2  million  m2  is  affected.  Thus  under  the  Project,  this  land  will  be\nbrought back into agricultural production, and the annual net additional output is conservatively\nvalued at Y158 million.\n\nc.\n\nNonvalued Benefits\n\n31. \nThe  Project  offers  other  benefits,  which  are  not  encapsulated  in  the  EIRR  calculation.\nThere is some very marginal increase in water supply capacity, since less water is needed for\nflushing,  as  well  as  shorter  period  when  the  system  is  shut  down.  This  water,  however,  is  not\nneeded to meet demand until well after the year 2010. There is also a flood control benefit to the\nProject  since  the  additional  water  conveyance  downstream  from  the  reservoir  increases  the\ncapacity  of  water  than  can  be  released  from  the  reservoir  during  times  of  flood.  Most\nimportantly,  the  Project  provides  and  protects  the  water  supply  of  the  city,  without  which\neconomic  activity  would  be  threatened.  When  considered  against  the  alternative  scenario,  the\neconomic gains are significant.\n\n32. \nAs  with  the  wastewater  component,  the  component  does  not  differentiate  between\nincome  levels  of  beneficiaries:  all  Tianjin  residents  will  have  access  to  the  improved  water\nsupply system. However, the poor are likely to suffer more without the project situation, where\nfor  example  the  cost  of  diverting  water  from  other  sources  will  be  higher  or  residents  may  be\nrequired  to  buy  bottled  water.  The  poor  are  more  vulnerable  and  will  be  above  average\nbeneficiaries of the Project.\n\nd.\n\nResults of the EIRR Analysis\n\n33. \nSensitivity assumptions are taken to be 10 percent. Table A12.3 summarizes the results\nof the EIRR analysis and the sensitivity tests and Table A12.4 (page 73) shows the calculation.\nThe  base  case  EIRR  is  14.7  percent,  which  exceeds  the  EOCC  of  12  percent.  Costs  would\nhave to increase by 24 percent and benefits would have to fall by 20 percent for the EIRR to fall\nbelow  the  EOCC.  Even  under  the  worst  case  sensitivity  test,  where  costs  increase  by  10\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 12, page 7\n\npercent  and  benefits  decrease  by  10  percent,  the  EIRR  does  not  fall  below  the  EOCC.  The\nEIRR calculation demonstrates that the component is economically viable. However, the margin\nby  which  the  EIRR  exceeds  the  EOCC  fails  to  reflect  the  true  economic  worth  of  the  Project,\nwhich  is  considered  to  be  much  higher,  since  the  potential  impact  of  not  undertaking  the\ncomponent has severe economic consequences.\n\nTable A12.3: Water Resources Component\nEconomic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Tests\n\nSensitivity\nIndicator\n\nSwitching\nValue\n\n0.62\n\n0.69\n\n24%\n\n20%\n\nBase Case\n\nCosts Increase by 10%\n\nBenefits Reduce by 10%\n\nCosts Increase by 10% and Benefits \n\nReduce by 10%\n\nBenefits Delayed by 1 Year\n\nD.\n\nOverall Project Analysis and Conclusions\n\n1.\n\nProject EIRR Analysis\n\n34. \nThe above analysis indicates that both the components are economically viable and that\nthey  stand  up  to  sensitivity  tests  where  costs  increase  and  revenues  decrease.  The  EIRR  for\nthe total Project has also been calculated. Since components are mutually exclusive, the sum of\nthe  costs  and  benefits  for  individual  components  has  been  used  for  the  overall  Project.  The\nrelative  size  of  the  component  in  terms  of  costs  and  benefits  means  that  the  results  of  the\nproject  analysis  are  reasonably  similar  to  those  for  the  other  component.  Table  A12.5\nsummarizes the results and Table A12.6 shows the calculation. The base case EIRRs is 14.8\npercent,  which  exceeds  the  EOCC  of  12  percent.  The  economic  analysis  demonstrates  the\neconomic  viability  of  the  two  components  and  the  overall  Project.  Especially  since  significant\nbenefits have not been valued in the EIRR analysis, the Project is economically worthwhile.\n\nTable A12.5: Project Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity
