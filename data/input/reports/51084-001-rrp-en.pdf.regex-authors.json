THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the Strengthening Information and Communication Technology Systems for Efficient \nand Transparent Public Investment and Tax Administration Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the Government of Mongolia in enhancing accountability \nand efficiency of public financial resource mobilization and management through improved \ninformation and communication technology (ICT), especially for tax administration and public \ninvestment management (PIM). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Mongolian economy has been through a major transition from traditional agriculture \nand livestock herding to a minerals-based economy since the late 1990s, and has become \nvulnerable to the risks associated with commodity price volatility. To mitigate the risks of external \nshocks and meet the demand for needed infrastructure investment for longer-term sustainable \neconomic  development,  Mongolia  needs  to  ensure  that  it  has  a  well-functioning  domestic \nresources  mobilization  mechanism.  Improving  the  efficiency  of  its  tax  administration  and \neffectiveness of its public service delivery through a PIM system predicated on principles such as \ntransparency, efficiency, and effectiveness is key to achieving this. Transparency is essential to \nmake the government more accountable, while efficiency and effectiveness are necessary for \nbetter and more effective use of limited public resources for delivery of needed public services. \n \n4.  Efforts to modernize and improve public finance management systems and arrangements \nin Mongolia have been consistent in direction, even if at times they have materialized slower than \nplanned. The government\u2014with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World \nBank, and other development partners\u2014has made meaningful progress in achieving the key \nobjectives  of  prudent  public  financial  management:  maintaining  fiscal  discipline,  strategic \nallocation of resources, and operational efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. The legal \nand regulatory framework has also been strengthened through the enactment of the Budget Law \n(2002, amended 2011) and investments in ICT systems both for tax administration and PIM. \n \n5.  However, as identified in assessments carried out under ADB technical assistance (TA) \nin 20142 and the World Bank 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Management Performance \nreport,3 challenges  with  public  financial  management  remain\u2014high  tax  arrears,  inefficient \ntaxpayer management, limited transparency, and ineffective tax collection\u2014while the PIM system \nsuffers from lack of longer-term fiscal planning, inefficient allocation and management of public \nresources,  and  a  weak  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanism.  Existing  ICT  systems  are \nfragmented, and there is also a lack of integrated information exchange and inefficient business \nprocesses. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Public Expenditure and Financial Management Performance Report. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Tax administration system: Government revenues are mainly generated from taxation \nand royalties from the mining industry.4 There are over 20 types of taxes administered by the \nMongolian Tax Authority (MTA) based on the General Law of Mongolia on Taxation (2008) \ncovering the entire range of direct and indirect taxes except customs duty and excise tax on \ncertain  goods,  imported  vehicles,  petroleum,  and  other  fuel.  The  MTA  is  the  central  tax \nadministration authority consisting of a number of entities, including the state administrative body \n(referred to as the General Department of Taxation), the agencies\u2019 offices, and tax branches at \nthe provincial and district level.5 Tax offices and branches at the local level independently carry \nout tax administration and only periodically provide data to the central server in the General \nDepartment of Taxation.  \n \n7.  An effective tax administration system consists of well-defined business processes that \ninclude taxpayer registration, tax collection, verification, accounting and auditing, and  other \nsupporting mechanisms. However, the existing ICT systems for tax administration in Mongolia \nwere  developed  to merely  replicate  the manual  business  processes, providing for  isolated \nadministration of each tax without leveraging taxpayer data across the registered taxes. The \ncurrent tax filing and payment compliance processes and systems require strengthening so that \nthey can automatically flag suspected cases for detailed assessment and audits. \n \n8.  A well-designed and integrated ICT system has a substantial role in improving the \ntaxpayer base as it enables the government to (i) identify unregistered and potential taxpayers; \n(ii) manage the life cycle of taxpayer registration and tax liabilities assessment, collection, and \nreporting; and (iii) enhance accountability in tax administration. The MTA began transitioning to \nan ICT-based tax administrative system and has been working to establish a tax information \nsystem to automate the registration of taxpayers and tax types, tax accounting and auditing, tax \npayment, and the tax refund process. However, planning and investments in ICT have been \nineffective, especially with different systems being outdated and operating for different business \nprocesses, resulting in isolated data repositories and systems in tax administration.6 \n \n9.  Public  investment  management.  The  major  parts  of  the  life  cycle  of  PIM  are \nadministered by the Budget Investment Department (BID) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).7 \nWhile a certain level of autonomy in local government with budget planning and execution for \nsmall investment projects exists, all fixed investment project proposals at the local government \nlevel that are fully or partially funded by the central government must still be submitted to the \nMOF.8 As inputs are required from ministries and agencies through their independently run \nsystems  to  successfully  complete  the  PIM  process  cycle,  interoperability,  availability  of \ninformation from external systems and interface with the core PIM, and monitoring systems are \nmajor challenges for PIM in Mongolia. \n \n                                                \n4  The largest revenue streams of reported government income are windfall tax (36% of total income) and corporate \nincome tax (17%). \n5  Local governments also have tax administration units for local taxes such as property tax, although a major portion \nof local government revenues still rely on central government fiscal transfers. \n6  Existing systems were developed separately for each tax type (e.g., personal income tax, corporate tax, value-added \ntax, property tax, etc.) and processes on various technology platforms resulting in more than 20 ICT systems in use \nwith unintegrated data sources. \n7  The life cycle of PIM includes development of investment project planning by receiving investment project proposals \nfrom ministries, agencies, and local governments; proposal review; submission for approval to Parliament of \nMongolia; and implementation of approved investment projects and project monitoring and evaluation. \n8  The authority of local governments has been significantly enhanced, with provincial governments responsible for \nbasic education, primary health care, urban planning and construction, social welfare services, water supply and \nsewerage, public transport, urban roads and bridges, and municipal services. These functions will be financed \nthrough local taxes and fiscal transfers from shared taxes.   \n ", "3 \n \n10.  Overall, the business process of PIM in Mongolia is fragmented and inefficient, often \ncausing suboptimal public investment decisions, underperformance of investment projects, and \nopaque monitoring and evaluation. Most of the PIM functions are carried out manually with data \nmaintained in Microsoft Excel sheets and in printed documents, resulting in ineffective monitoring \nof  the  investments,  physical  and  financial  progress,  and  results  and  benefits  from  such \ninvestments. Knowledge gaps also exist in understanding and designing business processes that \nare based on good practice. Thus, a comprehensive business process system for PIM is required \nfor transparent and efficient management of the entire life cycle of public investment. \n \n11.  There is also insufficient ICT capacity for PIM in Mongolia, with technical and functional \nlimitations that prevent optimized utilization of ICT for management of public investments. The \nexisting software, called Fiscal, in use for budget preparation offers very limited functionality for \nPIM. Its primary focus is on capturing the budgetary estimates for the project, with limited \nfunctionality for managing the entire life cycle of PIM. The system also needs to interface with the \ncritical ICT systems of the government that include the budget management system, the budget \npreparation information system, the expenditure management system, and the government \nfinancial management information system to create a seamless management ecosystem and \nenhance accountability of overall PIM. This is in line with the Government Action Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020 to improve PIM. 9 \n \n12.  Existing capacity and resource constraints in the BID also severely impedes the planning \nand management of PIM functions in Mongolia, particularly in aspects such as (i) the approach to \nand methodology for evaluating project proposals; (ii) selecting projects that fit with the overall \neconomic development vision and growth plans of the country; (iii) investment planning and policy \ndevelopment; and (iv) implementing, financing, monitoring, and evaluating selected projects.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: enhanced accountability and efficiency of \npublic financial resource mobilization and management (footnote 9). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: strengthened transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness in public investment \nand tax administration.10 \n \n14.  The project is part of ADB efforts to improve public financial resource mobilization and \nmanagement in Mongolia,11 and is built on recommendations and lessons12 from previous ADB \nTA and projects.13 The project is also unique and innovative in taking advantage of ICT for \nimproving  tax  administration  and  PIM,  addressing  inefficiency  and  transparency  in  both \ngovernment revenue and expenditure management at the same time. \n \n                                                \n9 Government of Mongolia. 2016.

The project will support (i) the MTA to redesign and improve business processes, establish \na tax administration and information system (TAIS), and develop capacities of the staff; and (ii) \nthe  BID  to  examine  and  redesign  business  processes,  develop  a  comprehensive  public \ninvestment management information system (PIMIS), and develop capacities of staff. \n \n16.  The project will have the following three outputs: \n(i)  Output  1:  Streamlined  and  improved  business  processes  for  tax \nadministration and public investment. The project will reengineer its current \nbusiness processes of tax administration and PIM in line with international good \npractices, 14  and  provide  necessary  support  in  redesigning  and  improving \nfunctional coverage of the system, integration requirements, and ICT infrastructure \nneeds.  Automation  of  standardized  and  simplified  business  processes  and \ninteractions  enhances  the  efficiency  internally  as  well  as  with  external \nstakeholders, facilitating better coordination and collaboration. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Improved  and  strengthened  information  and  communication \ntechnology  systems  for  tax  administration  and  public  investment \nmanagement. The project will support the executing agency to define functional \nand system requirements and develop ICT systems for the new TAIS and PIMIS. \nNew software and hardware will be procured. Existing facilities to accommodate \nnew ICT systems will be improved and expanded. \n(a)  Tax administration and information system. The project will support the \nMTA in consolidating its ICT infrastructure for hosting and managing its \nbusiness applications, including the TAIS, in the National Government Data \nCentre in Ulaanbaatar and the proposed disaster recovery site in Darkhan \ncity. The project will provide for the required ICT infrastructure (network, \nsecurity, computing, and storage infrastructure) and associated system \nsoftware required for hosting the TAIS in the data center and data recovery \nsite. The project will also provide for non-ICT infrastructure (air-conditioning, \nand transformers) needed for the data center. The project will also support \nmodernizing the ICT infrastructure in the MTA offices including desktop \ncomputers,  printers,  local  area  network,  and  wide  area  network  to \ninterconnect the tax offices to the data center and disaster recovery site.  \n(b)  Public investment management information system. The project will \nsupport the BID to develop or procure an integrated PIMIS and needed ICT \ninfrastructure including network, security, computing and data storage, and \nassociated system software for hosting the PIMIS. The current data center \nfor the MOF where the PIMIS is to be hosted will be expanded. With the \nimplementation  of the  integrated  PIMIS  system,  Mongolia  will  have  a \nseamless feed to the development plans from actual budget and projects. \nMoreover, development project selection will be based on enhanced and \ninformed social cost\u2013benefit analysis, and, hence, will deliver improved \nsocioeconomic value with adequate fund provisioning, which facilitates the \nreduction of risks to the government in large projects including public\u2013\nprivate partnership projects. \n \n                                                \n14 International good practice generally follows principles and guidelines of ADB, the Centre for Tax Policy and \nAdministration, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or other international standards \ndefined by the International Monetary Fund (Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool). \n ", "5 \n \n(iii)  Output  3:  Improved  capacity  of  government  staff  in  administering  and \nmanaging the tax administration and information system and the public \ninvestment management information system. A capacity development plan for \nrequired skills and staff will be prepared, and technical training workshops and \nseminars will be arranged and conducted. Public awareness activities will also be \nplanned and conducted. Sensitization and capacity building at different levels of \npolicy and execution strengthen the confidence in public service delivery. Citizens \nwill have enhanced trust in the government because of efficient service delivery \nand transparency. \n \n17.  Strategic  fit.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  emphasizes  the  importance  of  governance  and \ninstitutional  capacity  in  supporting  public  management  reforms  and  financial  stability  for \nsustainable and inclusive development.15 The project will support the government to continue its \nreform efforts in public financial resource management by strengthening tax administration and \nPIM.16 The design of the project follows ADB\u2019s sector and thematic operational plan, the Financial \nSector Operational Plan.17 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020; and the Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020.18 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n18.  The total investment of the project is $26.47 million (Table 1), for which the government \nhas requested a regular loan of $25.00 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, or 94.45% \nof the investment requirement, to help finance the project. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure \ncategory and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).19 \n \n19.  The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe loan agreement. Based on the straight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 15.25 \nyears, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per year. \n \n20.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures amounting \nto $25 million in relation to civil works for the data center building; the acquisition of ICT \ninfrastructure and hardware, ICT software and technical services, ICT maintenance, equipment, \nbusiness  process  and  advisory  services,  and  project  management;  physical  and  price \ncontingencies; and financing charges during construction. The Government of Mongolia will \nfinance the remaining $1.47 million, including taxes and duties, part of TAIS development, TAIS \nmaintenance support, and acquisition of servers. \n \n \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2018.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The PIMIS, when adapted, is expected to extend across all public entities with full or partial \ncentral government financing and investment projects, and sectors including all types of public \nsector expenditures (actual and contingencies), covering all steps and phases that a project must \ncomplete through its productive life and adding value to the country\u2019s socioeconomic development. \nThe PIMIS project will increase the accuracy, timeliness, and transparency of the budget and \nother public finance processes. This is likely to provide an opportunity for future alignment and \ncoherence of organization and processes involved in public finance management. \n \n23.  The TAIS project will replace a multitude of existing and dated ICT systems in place for \nthe MTA with a modern ICT system. Once the TAIS is implemented and is integrated with the \nexisting taxpayer service delivery systems (e-tax and value-added tax promotion systems) and \nother ICT systems of the government (e.g., General Department State Registration, Mongolian \nCustoms) it will support the MTA in enhancing its capabilities in taxpayer compliance monitoring, \ntimeliness in revenue collections, and in implementing the taxpayer risk management audit \nframeworks to minimize revenue leakages. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects and Handbook for Integrating Risk Analysis in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.20 The project is considered economically viable with the base-case results \nshowing an economic internal rate of return of 21.14%. The economic benefits considered for the \nproject include cost savings because of a more efficient tax information system, savings in travel \ncosts  for  taxpayers  and  tax  inspectors,  and  savings  attributable  to  improved  efficiency  in \ninvestment planning and project implementation. Sensitivity analysis was also undertaken to \nfurther test the economic viability of the project. The results indicate that the project is still \neconomically viable in the following scenarios: (i) 10% increase in capital costs; (ii) 10% increase \nin annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs; (iii) 10% decrease in benefits; (iv) 10% \nincrease in capital costs and O&M costs, plus 10% reduction in benefits; and (v) delay in the \nrealization of project benefits by 1 year. \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2017.

Financial sustainability analysis was undertaken to evaluate the potential impact of \nthe project on the budget of the MTA for the TAIS and of the MOF for the PIMIS. The TAIS O&M \ncosts in 2023 are estimated at $1.65 million, and for the PIMIS $1.41 million. Loan repayments \nfor the TAIS range from $1.50 million in 2024 to $1.00 million in 2038, and for the PIMIS from \n$0.99 million in 2024 to $0.66 million in 2038. Apart from the annual O&M costs and loan \nrepayments, the MTA and MOF should also allocate budget for other recurrent costs that occur \nevery 5\u201310 years. The O&M costs and the recurrent costs for the replacement of some of the ICT \nhardware and software every 5\u201310 years are justified given the significant cost savings from the \nproject. While the fiscal impact of the project on the MTA and MOF can be considered minimal, \nboth agencies have to allocate the necessary budget each year for the recurrent costs to ensure \ncontinuous operations of the information systems. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management assessment considered the capacity of the MOF as the \nexecuting agency and the implementing agency for the PIMIS, and the MTA as the implementing \nagency for the TAIS, including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial \nreporting systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The assessment concludes \nthat, while the MOF and MTA have organizations that are appropriate for a project implementing \nagency, training and capacity of their financial and accounting staff will need to be strengthened, \nespecially on ADB policies and procedures, and requirements. The implementing agencies have \naccounting systems that allow for the proper recording of project financial transactions. The \nimplementing agencies have internal audit units, and their financial statements are audited every \nyear by the National Audit Office. Budgeting systems and procedures are in place. Functional \nresponsibilities for internal control are undertaken by different units or individuals. The functions \nfor ordering, receiving, accounting, and payments are appropriately segregated. \n \n27.  The overall financial management risk is moderate, mainly because of the lack of MOF \nand MTA financial and accounting staff who will provide support to the project, the MTA\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with ADB procedures and requirements, and potential delays in the submission of \nproject financial  statements.  Mitigation  measures  include (i)  hiring  a financial  management \nspecialist to assist the MOF, MTA, and project implementation unit in preparing consolidated \nproject financial statements and providing support in daily financial management, including \nassisting  with  the  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements;  (ii)  providing  training  on  ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement guidelines and procedures to the relevant staff of the MOF and MTA; and (iii) hiring \nconsultants to provide assistance to the MOF and MTA in making timely submissions of the \naudited project financial statements.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  Due diligence has been conducted on (i) poverty and social analysis to assess the impacts \nof the project, following ADB\u2019s Handbook on Social Analysis;21 and (ii) gender analysis to assess \nthe potential of the project to contribute to gender equality, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Gender \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2006. Handbook on Social Analysis. Manila. \n \n ", "9 \n \nMainstreaming Categories in ADB Projects.22 Based on poverty, social, and gender assessments, \na draft summary poverty reduction and social strategy and gender performance target have been \ndeveloped. The project is categorized as having some gender elements. \n \n30.  Mongolia\u2019s  relatively  strong  regulatory  framework  and  international  commitments  to \ngender equality provide a solid foundation for mainstreaming and integrating gender issues \nthrough sector and local development policies and actions. Gender inequality is viewed as a major \ncontributing  factor  and  barrier  to  inclusive  growth  and  social  and  economic  development. \nAchieving gender equality contributes to improved economic growth and poverty reduction. The \nproject will include a specific sex-disaggregated target giving female government officers more \nopportunity to build capacity in ICT areas where women are provided with fewer opportunities not \nonly for job assignment but also for career progress, especially in management positions. While \nthe ratio of female staff in the MTA is 52.5% and in the MOF 53.5%, the female staff ratio of the \ninformation technology departments is only 25.0% in the MTA and zero in the MOF. Capacity \nbuilding programs and activities will target to encourage more female staff participation.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:23 \n \n32.  Environment (category C). The project is classified as environment category C. All \nrequired permits and approvals shall be obtained from government authorities following national \nregulations, if needed. The project will involve small construction works, including refurbishment \nand reconfiguration of local tax offices and upgrade of existing server rooms and data centers \nthrough reconfiguration and renovation in government building premises. The expansion of the \ndata center for the PIMIS will only involve adding a small annex to the existing building and will \nnot require foundations. Potential environmental impacts of these activities are expected to be \nminimal, and good practice will be applied during construction and operation following the PAM \nand national and ADB requirements. Disposal of used information technology equipment will \nstrictly follow Mongolian legislation on solid-waste management, especially the Law on Waste \nManagement  enacted  in  2017.  In  case  of  unexpected  environmental  impacts,  appropriate \nmeasures shall be taken in consultation with ADB by the BID, the MTA, and contractors during \nconstruction and operation. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not require any land acquisition \nor involve resettlement. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No specific communities of ethnic minorities or groups \nhave been identified and no adverse impacts are expected. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2012.
