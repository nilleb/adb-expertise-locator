The Project has four basic components.  \n \nComponent 1 entails support for a government leadership role to \nestablish  public-private  partnerships  with  rural  development \nenclaves focused on improving and extending health services to \nthe  surrounding  communities.  Health  services  will  include \nvoluntary counseling and testing (VCT), treatment and care (for \nsexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS) as well as the full \nrange  of  primary  health  care  services.  Component  1  will  also \nsupport  the  rehabilitation  of  rural  health  infrastructure, medical \nstaff training, and leadership development for HIV/AIDS advocacy.\n \nComponent  2  will  develop  local  civil  society  organizations\u2019 \ncompetency to work with affected communities to address issues \nrelated to the epidemic, leading to sustainable behavior change \nprograms.  The  Project  will  also  support  nationwide  social \nmarketing of condoms, which will be specifically structured to the \ncharacteristics of each region. \n \nComponent 3 involves strengthening and expanding the sentinel \nsurveillance system covering high- and low-risk populations and \nsettings. The surveillance system will produce regular updates \nand ensure broad dissemination of information. In addition to the \nsero-surveillance, the system will also include behavioral change \nsurveillance. \n \nComponent  4  entails  project  management,  including  project \nplanning, coordination with partners, monitoring, and evaluation. \n   \nRationale  The Project is consistent with the Government\u2019s Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Strategy  2005\u20132010  (MTDS)  and  the  National \nStrategic Plan for HIV/AIDS 2004\u20132008, and is informed by the \nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  work  on  the  Human  Development \nStrategy. It is also supported by ADB\u2019s Papua New Guinea (PNG) \ncountry  strategy  program  and  update and ADB\u2019s commitment to\n ", "ii   \n  poverty  reduction  and  achieving  the  millennium  development \ngoals,  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  grant  financing  is \nnecessary to facilitate the Project\u2019s focus on developing public-\nprivate partnerships and on strengthening government leadership \nin the fight against HIV/AIDS at all levels and within all agencies. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  In  line  with  the  MTDS,  the  expected  impact  is  to  control  the \nspread of HIV/AIDS infection by 2015 and stabilize it by 2020. The \noutcome  will  be  strengthened  efforts  of  the  Government  in \ndeveloping comprehensive responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, \nwith a focus on establishing operational partnerships and linkages \nto restructure rural health services associated with development \nenclaves. \n   \nCost Estimates  Total  cost  for  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $25  million \nequivalent.1  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a grant of $15 million from the Special Funds \nresources of ADB. \n($\u2019000 ) \n  Foreign  Local \nSources  Total  % \nExchange  Cost \n         \nADB Grant  8,549.5  6,450.5  15,000.0  60 \nGovernment of PNG  0  3,000.0  3,000.0  12 \nGovernment of Australia  986.9  2,513.1  3,500.0  14 \nGovernment of New \nZealand  986.9  2,513.1  3,500.0  14 \nTotal Cost to be Financed  10,523.3  14,476.7  25,000.0  100 \n       ADB = Asian Development Bank, PNG = Papua New Guinea. \n       Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nGrant Amount and Terms  It  is  proposed  that  a  $15  million  grant  be  provided  from  the \nSpecial Funds resources of ADB (ADF IX Grants Program) with \nterms and conditions substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Up to 31 July 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 January 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  National Department of Health (NDOH) \n                                                 \n1  The project cost estimates and its presentation in the RRP were negotiated and finally agreed at grant negotiations \nwith the Government prior to the issuance of the staff instructions on \u2018Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures \nfor Asian Development Bank Financing\u2019. Therefore, the table distinguishes between foreign and local cost. ", "  iii\n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented under the umbrella of PNG\u2019s \nArrangements  national sector-wide Health Sector Improvement Program (HSIP). \nNDOH, in its capacity as project Executing Agency, will house the \nproject coordinator, who will work in close association with the \nHSIP in all matters of project administration, as well as with the \nCountry Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) established by NDOH \nfor  the  Global  Fund  to  fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria \n(Global Fund). The CCM will review progress and guide project \nimplementation, ensuring management and resource efficiencies \nare achieved with the Global Fund. \n   \nProject implementation will be performed by NDOH; the National \nAIDS Council Secretariat (NACS); provincial and district health \noffices,  hospitals,  and  health  facilities;  the  National  Research \nInstitute, World Health Organization (WHO), Joint United Nations \nProgramme  on  HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS),  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), a not-for-profit social marketing company \nand a separate company for behavioral change, and participating \neconomic operators in rural development enclaves. \n \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government,  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID), and New Zealand Agency \nfor  International  Development  (NZAID),  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants and administer the two consultancy contracts under \ncomponent 2.  \n \nThe economic operators will provide oversight and manage the \npartnerships with the public health facilities in their communities \nand  provide  health  services  to  their  employees  and  the \nsurrounding communities. NGOs, community-based organizations \n(CBOs), and faith-based organizations (FBOs) will be trained to \ndeliver  HIV  prevention  activities,  behavior  change  and \ncommunication, VCT, treatment, and care, including home-based \ncare. \n   \nProcurement  Grant-financed civil works, goods and materials will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nProject civil works are small and limited to the repair and upgrade \nof existing facilities. No land acquisition will be necessary. All civil \nworks will be awarded either through local competitive bidding or, \nwhere circumstances warrant, through the direct engagement of \nthe  economic  operators  in  the  selected  rural  development \nenclaves. \n \n  Goods or materials valued at $1 million or more will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding,  and  those  valued  at \nover $100,000 and under $1 million will use either international \nshopping or local competitive bidding. \n ", "iv   \n  Direct purchase/negotiation or single tender may be employed \nwhen buying small or off-the-shelf items valued at up to $100,000. \n \nAll condoms and related supplies for the social marketing program \nwill be procured by the contracted not-for-profit company. \n   \nConsulting Services  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \n  arrangements  suitable  to  ADB  will  apply  in  the  selection  and \n  engagement of the consultants.  \n   \n  Two  international  companies/NGOs  will  be  engaged,  one  to \n  design,  train,  supervise  and  monitor  the  behavior  change \n  programs (to be carried out through local NGOs/CBOs/FBOs and \n  communities), and the other to design the plan for and conduct \n  the social marketing of condoms. In both cases, ADB will take \n  responsibility for the engagement and ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-\n  based selection (QCBS) will be applied. \n   \n  Individual  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  under  the \n  Project  by  NDOH  for  the  following  positions:  (i)  project \n  coordinator,  (ii)  HIV  sero-surveillance  specialist/epidemiologist, \n  (iii)  behavioral  surveillance  specialist,  and  (iv)  procurement \n  specialist.  \n   \n  Individual domestic consultants will also be engaged by NDOH for \n  the following positions: (i) project accountant, (ii) field supervisor, \n  (iii) trainer supervisors for surveillance, (iv) statistician, (v) data \n  entry clerks, and (vi) interviewers.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Benefits will include a decreased burden of HIV, improved overall \nBeneficiaries  health  status  of  people  in  participating  rural  development \nenclaves,  and  expanded  primary  health  care  and  community-\nbased activities in rural areas. Other benefits will be public and \nprivate savings in health expenditures, including indirect costs as \na  result  of  reduced  morbidity  from  emerging  and  endemic \ndiseases,  and  productivity  gains  from  improved  education, \nespecially through less absenteeism and reduced dropout rates. \n \nThe Project is pro-poor in its focus on delivering and expanding \nprimary  health  care  services  in  rural  areas.  By  increasing  the \nmeans for reducing the risks of HIV infection among the highest \nrisk groups, the Project will increase the likelihood that low income \npeople  reduce  their  own  risks  to  infection.  Generally,  men, \nwomen, and children will benefit equally from greater access to \nhealth care, but in some project areas women and children will be \nthe primary beneficiaries of more accessible health services. ", "  v\n  Several  activities  of  the  Project  consist  of  community-level \ninterventions,  such  as  targeted  behavior  change  programming \nthrough  capacity  development  of  communities  and  local  civil \nsociety  organizations.  Women,  including  sex  workers,  will  be \nmajor beneficiaries of these community interventions. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  the  potential  for \nsustainability given the limited time of the grant and the need for \ngreater  Government  commitment  to  the  HIV  response.  Each \nmemorandum  of  agreement  between  the  Government  and  a \nprivate sector operator will be structured to encourage sustainable \n  cooperation and help strengthen the commitment of each party. \nThe  competencies  developed  by  NDOH  will  ensure  the \nestablishment of new (post-project) public-private partnerships in \nthe Government\u2019s continued comprehensive response to the HIV \nepidemic. By establishing a consortium of development partners \nto cofinance and support an independent, professional not-for-\nprofit company to establish and run the social marketing program, \nthis essential HIV prevention intervention becomes a collaborative \neffort  and  less  dependent  on  any  single  partner\u2019s  decision  to \ncontinue after 4 years or not. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  will  strive  to  work  within  and  strengthen  HSIP \nsystems,  but  an  alternative  mechanism  may  be  needed  if  the \nHSIP becomes dysfunctional.  \n \nPNG\u2019s health system over the past several years has experienced \na  diminishing  ability  to  provide  services,  especially  at  the \ncommunity  level,  because  of  insufficient  supplies,  inadequate \nsupervision,  and  large  numbers  of  nonperforming  health  staff \nmembers on payroll. Extensive reform of the health system is \nneeded but unlikely to occur soon.  \n \nA major concern is the Government\u2019s absorptive capacity for the \nlarge  influx  of  funds  from  the  Global  Fund,  ongoing  AusAID \nsupport, and the proposed ADB grant. The amount of funds to be \ndisbursed and the number of program and project activities under \nthe  health  sector  could  pose  significant  challenges  to  the \nGovernment  at  all  levels.  Extensive  consultations  and \ncoordination have been undertaken with the key supporters of \nHIV/AIDS  activities  in  PNG  to  ensure  synergies  and  working \npartnerships  and  to  avoid  duplication.  No  new  institutional \nstructures are required for the Project.  \n \nA  worsening  economic  situation  will  drive  more  women  into \ntransactional sex and high-risk behavior. Risks and assumptions \nappear in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n   \n \n ", "", "  vii\nMap \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and \nControl  in  Rural  Development  Enclaves  Project  (the  Project);  and  (ii)  the  proposed \nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of cofinancing for the Project to be \nprovided equally on a grant basis by the governments of Australia and New Zealand. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Background \n2.  About  47,000  people in  PNG  were  infected with  the  HIV  virus  as of  mid-2004.1  A \ngeneralized HIV epidemic is under way, with prevalence rates among 15\u201349-year-olds at 3\u20134% \nin Port Moresby, well over 2% in other urban areas, and over 1% in rural areas. The HIV \nepidemic in PNG is at an advanced and critical stage: infection patterns, such as 15-30% \nannual increases in infection rates, are similar to those of the early stages of HIV spread in sub-\nSaharan Africa.2 One forecast estimates that PNG\u2019s workforce could be reduced by 34% by \n2020.3 Containment of the epidemic requires an urgent and long-term response, and therefore \nthe Government of PNG has requested ADB for a grant to establish a project that will develop \npublic\u2013private sector partnerships to prevent and control the spread of the disease in rural \nHIV/AIDS \u201chotspots\u201d around the country. Many of these hotspots are associated with local \ncenters  of  economic  activity  (also  known  as  \u201cdevelopment  enclaves\u201d),  such  as  mines, \nplantations, logging sites, fisheries, and ports, and therefore a comprehensive response to the \nthreat of HIV/AIDS must include the participation of the private sector. \n \n3.  PNG\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development Strategy 2005\u20132010 (MTDS) focuses on export-\ndriven growth supported by good governance, rural development, poverty reduction, and human \nresource development. The sectors identified as having the greatest export potential include \nagriculture (cocoa, coffee, copra, oil palm, and spices), fisheries, forestry, manufacturing, mining \nand other nonrenewable resources (e.g., petroleum and other fuels), services, and tourism. \nMany of these economic sectors typically comprise discrete rural enclaves, which generate local \njobs  and  a  cash  economy,  in  stark  contrast  to  their  surroundings,  where  people  rely  on \nsubsistence farming. However, these enclaves also inadvertently foster the exchange of goods \nand cash for sex among the mostly impoverished peripheral populations. High-risk sex behavior \nis associated with the surrounding populations of rural enclave development sites because of \nincreasing  poverty,  and  the  areas  around  the  enclaves  are  becoming  HIV/AIDS  hotspots. \nTherefore, a comprehensive response to the threat of HIV/AIDS must include the participation of \nthe private sector. \n \n                                                 \n1 The 2004 National Consensus Workshop estimated that 25,000\u201369,000 people were infected with HIV in PNG, and \nthen used the median estimate of 47,000 as an official figure.

The MTDS acknowledges that the fight against HIV/AIDS is not just a health issue or the \nGovernment\u2019s  sole  responsibility.  The  HIV  epidemic  threatens  the  country\u2019s  economic  and \nsocial fabric. The National Department of Health (NDOH) has developed a policy on broad-\nbased  and  inclusive  partnerships  covering  public\u2013private  arrangements  with  economic \noperators, civil society organizations, and development partners in the delivery of health care \nservices. NDOH is also implementing a sector-wide approach (SWAp) that brings together all \nstakeholders in health under the Government\u2019s National Health Plan. The National HIV/AIDS \nCouncil (NAC) has prepared the comprehensive National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 2004-\n2008  (NSP).  At  the  core  of  the  HIV/AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  in  Rural  Development \nEnclaves  Project,  and  consistent  with  NDOH  and  NSP  priorities,  is  the  development  of \nfunctional partnerships between public and private sectors and development partners, each \nassuming responsibility for a role or task where a comparative advantage exists. 4 \n \n2.  HIV/AIDS Statistics and Situation \n5.  HIV in PNG was first confirmed in six cases in 1987, and AIDS was reported in 1988. \nSince the mid-1990s, the HIV epidemic has been growing rapidly. At the end of 2004, a national \nconsensus workshop reviewed all data. The final estimates of people 15\u201349 years old living with \nHIV in mid-2004 ranged from 24,528 (low scenario) to 46,744 (medium scenario) to 68,966 \n(high scenario). The estimated prevalence was 0.9\u20132.5%, with a median of 1.7% among 15\u201349-\nyear-olds. Including people below and above that age range, the medium estimate of infected \npeople in mid-2004 was 80,000, with a prevalence of about 1.5% of the total population. \n \n6.  These estimates indicate that a generalized, sexually transmitted HIV epidemic is under \nway. The ratio of males to females has been almost equal from the earliest years of the \nepidemic, and recently rates have risen among younger women. The prevalence rates among \n15\u201349\u2013year-olds are at least 3-4% in Port Moresby, well over 2% in other urban areas, and over \n1% in rural areas. Because 83% of the population is rural, about 66% of those living with HIV \ncan be expected to be in the rural areas. \n \n7.  Estimations based on available data and the rapidly rising intake of AIDS patients at \nhospitals indicates that the situation is becoming dire. The true extent of the problem country-\nwide is difficult to gauge as surveillance systems are poor, not designed for public health \ninterventions, and do not include at-risk groups. About 60% of all cases are detected in Port \nMoresby, where most HIV testing takes place. It is likely that traditional high-risk groups, such \nas  sex  workers  and  their  main  clients,  and  men  who  have  sex  with  men  have  higher \nconcentrations of infections than most other social groups. Sexually active young people in \ngeneral and people working or living in and around development enclaves are particularly likely \nto have higher prevalence of HIV.  \n \n8.  Thus  far,  PNG\u2019s  overall  response  to  the  epidemic  has  been  fragmented  and \nuncoordinated. A review of the execution of the National HIV/AIDS Medium-Term Plan for \n1998\u20132002,  which  encompassed  a  broad-based  multisectoral  approach,  revealed  little \nprogress. A later attempt at developing a national strategic plan lacked prioritization and costing. \nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) plans extensive \ntreatment and testing but little in the way of evidence-based prevention programs. A new \n                                                 \n4  Technical assistance (TA) worth $175,000 was provided to develop the Project under TA 4583-PNG (ADB. 2005. \nTechnical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Preparation of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in Rural \nDevelopment Enclaves Project. Manila). ", "  3\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID) program is under development and \nis exploring new ways to address the problem.  \n \n9.  It  has  long  been  recognized  that  mines,  logging  camps,  fisheries  plant,  and  other \nenclaves of economic production have high potential risk factors for HIV. HIV data from mines, \nas at Porgera and Ok Tedi, show increasing levels of infection in the workforce and surrounding \ncommunities. Out of 920 persons tested at Porgera Hospital in 2004, 7.7% were infected with \nHIV, and figures for 2005 (not yet complete) are expected to be even higher. Some of the mines \nhave  begun  to  respond  but  much  more  work  is  required.  Particularly  in  the  surrounding \ncommunities, denial, fear, and the widespread stigma associated with HIV continue to hamper \nprevention efforts.  \n \n10.  All  industries  will  need  additional  technical  support  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS.  Logging \ncompanies,  shipping  and  trucking  companies,  maritime  industries,  and  others  collectively \nrepresent a crucial axis of HIV spread. These and other economic enclaves, therefore, also \nrepresent  a  great  opportunity  for  preventive  interventions.  Although  home-based  care, \nantiretroviral (ARV) treatment, and treatment for opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis \n(TB) are also greatly needed, effective prevention is of paramount importance. \n \n3.  Health Sector Financing, including HIV/AIDS \n11.  An important factor in the declining capacity of provincial and district governments to \ndeliver  quality  health  services  has  been  the  successive  attempts  at  decentralization.  Real \nexpenditures on goods and services\u2014critical for quality health care\u2014decreased by almost 46% \nover  1997-2003.  Real  expenditures  on  recurrent  capital  items\u2014crucial  for  maintaining \nequipment  and  capital  stocks\u2014have  fallen  nearly  90%  to  almost  zero.  However,  real \nexpenditures on staffing emoluments have increased 8% in real terms. By contrast, the total \nresources available for the response to HIV/AIDS are high in 2005 (well in excess of $20 million; \nmore than $3.50 per capita). Less than 10% of this amount will come from the Government in \n2005, with an anticipated reduction in funding over the next 5 years. \n \n12.  The total 2004 health expenditure of K475.3 million, not including that for HIV/AIDS, \nrepresented 11% of total government and development partner expenditure for the year. The \nGovernment\u2019s  share  of  the  total was  68.4%.  Total  health  sector  expenditure  not  including \nHIV/AIDS increased in nominal terms from K373.9 million in 2001 to K475.3 million in 2004, but \nin real terms decreased from K373.9 million in 2001 to K339.2 million in 2004. In real terms, \nexpenditure declined from K69.8 per capita in 2001 to K58.6 in 2004. \n \n13.  Expenditure to fight HIV/AIDS is evolving. In 2002, about 90% of the about K40 million \ntotal  expenditure  on  HIV/AIDS  came  from  AusAID.  The  participating  stakeholders  in  the \nprevention and control of HIV/AIDS have increased substantially in the past year. However, \nAusAID\u2019s relative weight is only just beginning to change. One of the new major additions of \nfunding for HIV/AIDS is the Global Fund. The Agreement for HIV/AIDS, which was signed \nbetween the Global Fund and the Government on 30 June 2005, had a start date of 1 August \n2005. The agreement provides for $8.49 million to be released to NDOH, the principal recipient, \nover 2 years and managed through the Government\u2019s Health Sector Improvement Program \n(HSIP). \n \n ", "4   \n4.  Development Partners and Assistance \n14.  PNG  has  attracted  a  variety  of  development  partners  concerned  with  HIV/AIDS.5 \nResources available in 2005 for the fight against HIV, including the Global Fund, are about $22 \nmillion, with less than 10% from the Government. AusAID has been the major contributor to HIV \nprograms in PNG, and its focus has been the financing of the provincial AIDS committees, \ncondoms,  sexually  transmitted  disease  training,  voluntary  counseling  and  treatment  (VCT), \nsurveillance, and high-risk settings. The other major donors include the European Union (a peer \neducation project in high-risk settings), the British High Commission (working in East Sepik \ncommunities), United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (working with sex \nworkers and men who have sex with men in selected locations), and recently, the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. The United Nations (UN) agencies, collectively coordinated by Joint United \nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), have also contributed (see Appendix 2 on external \nassistance). The World Bank has invested in analytic work, and New Zealand Agency for \nInternational Development (NZAID) has begun to consider program investment.  \n \n15.  Few international NGOs with strong professional reputations in the HIV/AIDS sector \nhave been attracted to PNG. Donors usually implement their projects among communities \nthrough civil society organizations, which, with the exception of a few faith-based ones, are few, \nsmall, and struggling. Building local capacity to carry out various types of programs will require \nlong-term,  resident  expertise;  the  transfer  of  knowledge  and  skills;  and  a  high  level  of \ninvestment.  Economic  operators  represent  an  untapped  organizational  unit  capable  of \nimplementing HIV/AIDS programs with assistance. The demand from most of these economic \noperators for assistance is great. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems, Lessons Learned, and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints \n16.  Weak Governance. Poor governance and inadequate public sector management are \nconsidered the main development problems in PNG.6 Redressing fiscal discipline is the most \ncritical requirement, but there is little evidence of commitment to reform. These problems will \ncontinue to be addressed by the ongoing ADB-supported Financial Management Project and \nPublic Service Program. \n \n17.  High Levels of Associated Diseases. The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs) is high in males and females, urban and rural (Supplementary Appendix 3). TB is also on \nthe rise. Other countries\u2019 experience shows clearly that, as HIV infections increase, so do TB \ninfections and deaths caused by TB/HIV co-infection. Hospitals in PNG are already reporting \nthat the number of new TB patients is increasing. TB is now the main cause for admission in \nadult inpatient wards. National inpatient data for pulmonary TB from 1996 to 2000 showed a rise \nin registration of 21% (from 3,916 cases to 4,723) and in mortality. Therefore, any project on \nHIV/AIDS must also deal with primary health care issues as well. \n \n18.  Growing  At-Risk  Groups.  The  loss  of  traditional  mechanisms  of  social  control,  in \ncombination with the development of a cash economy and urbanization, has had an enormous \nimpact on traditional sexual cultures. Today extramarital sex is common as is multi-partnered \npremarital sex, though no adequate survey research has measured the true levels of risk \n                                                 \n5 See Appendix 2 for details on external assistance for HIV/AIDS in PNG. \n6 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Papua New Guinea. Manila. ", "  5\nbehaviors. Sex workers in urban areas and urban-like enclaves represent the most at-risk group \nin the country. One study of rural and peri-urban women revealed that 55% of women stated \nthey had at some time exchanged sex for money and/or goods, and 36% of men had paid for \nsex with cash. The clients of urban sex workers, who, in one study of Lae and Port Moresby, \nwere  most  frequently  businessmen,  foreigners,  police,  miners,  loggers,  and  security  men, \nshould also be considered at high risk. In addition to these groups of men, studies mention \ngovernment workers, fishermen, sailors, and truckers.  \n \n19.  Studies have shown that a large number of men (about 12% of rural or peri-urban men, \naccording to one national study) at times have sex with men, with no implications for identity. \nSuch men represent a large bridging population, having sex with both men and women.  \n \n20.  The growing at-risk groups situation is further complicated by the near total absence of \ncondoms in rural areas, where most people live and where most people infected with HIV are \nlocated. Moreover, general cultural reluctance to discuss sex and sexuality represents one of \nthe most serious deficits in most AIDS educational efforts.  \n \n21.  Gender and Cultural Issues. Gender and cultural, as well as institutional, issues also \ncontribute to the epidemic. While religions and traditional cultures discourage extramarital sex, \nin many PNG cultures premarital sex has never been stringently prohibited, especially among \nmales. Most development enclaves are staffed by a large majority of males. Their paydays \nattract many women willing to exchange sex for cash, and in some areas small brothels have \nemerged. In general, women are responsible for raising food for their families, and analysis of \nan earlier national nutrition survey showed that small cash incomes in the hands of women, \nrather than men, benefit children. The exchange of sex for material goods or services has \ntraditional roots in some but not most areas, where it is clearly the lack of means to raise a cash \nincome that motivates the rural sex trade.  \n \n22.  Challenges within the Health System. Overall, PNG\u2019s health system is in a state of \ndecline, with services becoming less accessible to rural people. Key health indicators such as \nimmunization coverage and the ratio of doctors and nurses per 10,000 population are among \nthe worst in the Pacific region (Supplementary Appendix 1). A functioning primary health care \nsystem no longer exists in much of the country. Specifically, the Government has not made \nsubstantial financial allocations to HIV/AIDS, leaving donors to determine the intensity and \ndirection of the response. Technical capacity for HIV/AIDS work in all sectors is low, and \nprevention strategies over-emphasize awareness and knowledge for the general population in \nlieu of evidence-based targeted investments.  \n \n23.  The  HIV  surveillance  system  is  also  problematic.  Recent  efforts  have  attempted  to \nestablish sentinel surveillance at antenatal clinics and STI clinics in 3\u20135 sites. However, the \nsystem  has  not  been  performing  reliably  and  the  data  reflect  unknown  biases.  Scanty \nsupervision, a slow confirmation process and poor reporting have seriously hampered the effort. \nHigh-risk groups have not been included, and the surveillance has not evolved into second-\ngeneration mode, i.e., with the addition of at least one STI and properly sampled behavioral \nsurveys.  \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n24.  Donor Funding in the Health Sector. Donors account for a vast share of the health \nsector\u2019s budget, and increasingly this funding is used for recurrent costs. However, much of \ndonor financing of health is off budget and outside government systems, leading to a diverse \n ", "6   \nand fragmented health financing system.7 All sources of health financing clearly need to be \nintegrated  under  the  government  systems  to  ensure  a  programmatic,  rather  than  project-\noriented, approach to health. The use of HSIP for this Project will help the Government plan and \nmanage health funds and activities in more systematically.  \n \n25.  Increased  Coordination  and  Information  Flows.  Overall  coordination  and  wider \ndissemination of information from various development partner-funded projects is needed for \nPNG\u2019s health sector. Health projects are often implemented in relative isolation from other, often \ncomplementary,  projects.  Many  health  projects  report  to  their  sponsor  and  government \ncounterpart,  but  little  of  this  information  is  distributed  to  other  development  partners  and \nstakeholders. Donor coordination or harmonization is needed to combat the HIV epidemic and \nhelp the Government develop an integrated strategy.  \n \n26.  Need  for  Greater  Oversight  and  Transparency.  A  key  lesson  learned  from  the \nEstablishment  of  Pilot  HIV/AIDS  Care  Centers8  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  that  greater \noversight  is  needed  for  project  implementation  as  well  as  regular  reporting  and  improved \ntransparency. For instance, drug stock-outs have been frequent in the HIV/AIDS care centers \nproject because of weak management and insufficient inventory controls on drugs. Hence, the \nProject  will  develop  direct  links  with  these  centers  to  facilitate  improved  supervision  and \nmanagement of their operations. \n \n27.  Condom Distribution Programs. Investment in effective modes of HIV prevention has \nbeen inadequate. The primary mode of transmission is through unsafe sex, indicating a great \nneed for increased and improved condom use. In spite of previous efforts at social marketing to \npromote  condom  use  and  reduce  the  stigma  of  having  HIV,  condom  use  has  not  risen \nsignificantly. An earlier social marketing program started well with low-priced condoms, but later \nattempted to generate revenue by raising prices of condoms. Social marketing programs that \naim to recoup costs have not been successful in PNG or elsewhere. The better programs \ndepend on donor subsidies but use the full panoply of private sector marketing techniques, \nincluding extensive in-depth research repeated throughout the entire life of the project. \n \n28.  The  current  condom  distribution  effort  by  NAC  secretariat  (NACS)  and  AusAID\u2019s \nNational HIV/AIDS Support Project (NHASP) has made progress mainly in selected urban areas \nand in terms of brand recognition, but the program\u2019s impact nationwide has been limited. First, \nthe messages used do not reflect the totality and complexity of sexual behavior in PNG and the \ndifferences by region. Second, the entire campaign has been largely urban-biased (as has been \nthe monitoring) and has had limited reach in rural areas, where most of the HIV is spreading. \nThird, the media campaign has not devoted sufficient attention to face-to-face contact with HIV-\npositive people, a technique that numerous studies have shown to be most effective.9 \n \n3.  Opportunities \n29.  Developments  in  Health  Institutions.  Although  many  gaps  remain  in  the  national \nresponse  to  HIV/AIDS,  there  have  been  some  positive  developments.  Recent  government \nactions include the appointment of a new adviser to the Prime Minister on HIV/AIDS and placing \n                                                 \n7  World Bank, AusAID, and ADB.

With the successful application to the Global \nFund, which is aimed primarily at developing ARV treatment programs, NDOH has become \nmore involved than in the recent past. The Global Fund will enable NDOH to build up an \nHIV/AIDS unit consisting of several people compared to just one person before the grant was \nprovided. Hence, the capacity for HIV/AIDS prevention and control within NDOH is expected to \ngrow and support HIV/AIDS projects. \n \n30.  Global  Fund.  The  Global  Fund  entered  into  an  agreement  on  HIV/AIDS  with  the \nGovernment  on  30  June  2005.  The  association  with  the  Global  Fund  will  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s response to the HIV epidemic. The Project will work closely with the Global Fund \nunder  the  Country  Coordination  Mechanism  (CCM),  seeking  synergies  and  undertaking \ncomplementary activities. The support from the Global Fund for ARVs and rapid HIV test kits will \nbe critical inputs for the public-private partnerships for HIV/AIDS prevention and care in the \ndevelopment enclaves and surrounding communities. The partnerships established under the \nProject will simultaneously serve as highly needed outlets for distributing the Global Fund \nprocurement items in rural areas. It will be critical, however, to ensure open and frequent \ncommunication and coordination among the various implementing agencies in the Project, for \nthe Global Fund, and other major HIV/AIDS initiatives. \n \n31.  Ongoing ADB-Assisted Initiatives and PNG Country Strategy Program and Update.  \nUnder TA 4208 (footnote 8) a fully operational care center has been organized in the Port \nMoresby General Hospital (PMGH) providing treatment to about 150 patients as of July 2005. \nThe  clinic\u2019s  establishment  was  a  collaborative  effort  by  NDOH,  PMGH,  World  Health \nOrganization (WHO), ADB, and AusAID. Care centers are programmed for urban government \nhospitals in Mount Hagen, Lae, and Rabaul, using the model and experience of the care center \nin PMGH.. The Project will make use of these HIV/AIDS care centers in terms of referrals from \nthe public\u2013private partnerships and lower levels of public health facilities for advanced care of \nHIV/AIDS patients and HIV test confirmations.  \n \n32.  Partnerships with Private Sector. The pre-fact-finding and fact-finding missions under \nthe project preparatory TA revealed a high level of awareness in the private sector of the \nHIV/AIDS problem, its relationship with surrounding communities, and the need to embark \nimmediately on HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives in and around the communities. Some of the \nlarger economic operators provide varying degrees of health services to their staff and families, \nbut many operators expressed their concern about how to tackle HIV/AIDS. The health services \ncould be restructured to accommodate the peripheral populations and operate as a focal point \nfor  HIV/AIDS  preventive  services  and  initializing  treatment  and  care  for  people  living  with \nHIV/AIDS. The public\u2013private partnership will merge the Government\u2019s response to HIV/AIDS \nwith the private sector\u2019s need to maintain a healthy, productive workforce and surrounding \ncommunities. Participation will be encouraged by the government but will be voluntary. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n33.  In line with the MTDS and NSP, the expected impact will be \u201cto have controlled by 2015, \nand  stabilized  by  2020,  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS.\u201d10  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  by \nGovernment efforts to develop comprehensive responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with a \n                                                 \n10  The Government\u2019s version of the Millennium Development Goal 6, target 7, has been tailored to be more realistic \nfor PNG and has been integrated into the MTDS. \n ", "8   \nfocus on establishing operational partnerships and links to restructure rural health services \nassociated with development enclaves.11 \n \n34.  Private  sector  health  services  provided  by  economic  operators12  to  their  staff  and \nfamilies will be restructured to accommodate the surrounding populations and will operate as a \nfocal point for HIV/AIDS preventive services, VCT, and treatment and care. The public\u2013private \npartnership will merge the Government\u2019s response to HIV/AIDS with the private sector\u2019s need to \nmaintain a healthy, productive workforce and surrounding communities. \n \n35.  Integrating the fight against HIV/AIDS in other sectors in addition to health is a strategy \nthat requires cooperation and partnership arrangements between key government agencies, \nprivate industry, development partners, and civil society organizations. Prevention will be the \nhigher  strategic  priority.  At  the  same  time,  core  public  health  strategies  will  not  be \novershadowed by the HIV/AIDS response. Improved health services extended to surrounding \npopulations will include maternal and child health services, immunization, malaria prevention, \nTB control, and health promotion. \n \nB.  Outputs \n36.  The Project proposes to help strengthen government leadership and the implementation \nof strategies to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS, with a focus on rural populations. The Project \nhas four components, which were designed in close coordination with ongoing and planned \nHIV/AIDS initiatives under the Global Fund (through NDOH), NACS, and the main development \npartners active in PNG. Many of the components\u2019 activities are consistent with or directly \nsupport the NSP 2004\u20132008.13 The four components are the following: \n \n1.  Component 1: Establish Public\u2013Private Sector Partnerships in Rural \nDevelopment Enclaves and Interagency Partnerships \n37.  Component  1  comprises  four  elements:  (i)  public\u2013private  partnerships  with  rural \neconomic operators to extend and improve rural health service delivery and HIV prevention and \ncare; (ii) rehabilitation of rural health infrastructure for primary health care and upgrading of \nfacilities required for HIV prevention, testing, and care; (iii) collaboration with WHO, NDOH, \nNACS, and partners\u2019 training and protocols; and (iv) development of leadership for HIV/AIDS \nadvocacy. \n \na.  Public\u2013Private Partnerships with Rural Economic Operators \n \n38.  Primary health care, including maternal and child health, and HIV/AIDS prevention and \ntreatment will be expanded in rural areas by establishing public\u2013private partnerships in rural \n                                                 \n11 \u201cDevelopment enclave\u201d refers to a particular area in a rural setting that has a significant private sector investment \nemploying a large number of people, becomes a cash economy in a generally subsistence rural economy in the \nsurrounding communities, and typically becomes the major (or only) economic driver in the area. One investment \nproject may dominate an entire district or provincial economy, making it a hub of economic activity. \n12  \u201cEconomic operator\u201d refers to the core private industry in the development enclave, usually a single dominant \nmining operation, plantation, fisheries plant, or other such project. The owner or company may have headquarters \nand other project sites elsewhere in PNG or overseas, and the activity in the enclave is often run by a subsidiary \nthat has negotiated land-use rights and royalties agreements with the land-owning clan. \n13  The NSP 2004\u20132008 contains seven focus areas: (i) treatment, counseling, and care and support; (ii) education \nand prevention through behavior change; (iii) epidemiology and surveillance; (iv) social and behavior change \nresearch; (v) leadership, partnership, and coordination; (vi) family and community support; and (vii) monitoring and \nevaluation. ", "  9\ndevelopment  enclaves.  The  private  operator  will  support  the  extension  of  health  services \nbeyond  their  immediate  employees  and  their  families  to  the  communities  surrounding  the \ndevelopment enclave. The local public health facilities and aid posts, where functioning, will \ncontinue to provide health services to the wider population, but the private operator will provide \nadditional management and supervision support to the community health facility to ensure more \neffective services. Where local public health facilities are not functioning around an enclave, the \nGovernment and private operator will work together in rehabilitating the facilities and staffing \nthem with appropriate health personnel (provided by government). Public\u2013private partnerships \nfor primary health care and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment will be launched in at least four \nrural development enclaves and expand to more sites later. \n \n39.  The Project will enhance the Government\u2019s capacity to initiate such partnerships and \noffer a range of inputs that will be negotiated and tailored to each development enclave's needs. \nEach  enterprise  and  development  enclave  is  unique,  defined  by  the  cultural  setting  of \nsurrounding  communities,  the  type  of  enterprise,  and  their  ongoing  interaction.  Template \nmemoranda of agreement (MOAs) will be designed under the Project and approved by CCM for \n(i)  partnerships  with  private  sector  economic  operators;  and  (ii)  civil  society  organizations \nproviding at least one of the following: VCT, care, treatment, and training. Other template MOAs \nmay be prepared as the need arises.  \n \nb.  Rural Health Infrastructure and Supplies \n40.  The partnerships will require strengthened health infrastructure in the rural areas. The \nProject  will  upgrade  health  facilities  in  the  pilot  areas  by  repairing  clinics,  partitioning  off \ncounseling rooms for the privacy of VCT, supplying additional medical equipment and supplies, \nand providing vehicles for community outreach and emergency transport. The Government will \ncontribute its normal staff, supplies, and equipment, but also ensure that rapid HIV test kits, STI \nmedicines,  and  ARV  treatment  from  the  Global  Fund  are  provided  to  enclave  clinics  and \nsurrounding health facilities.14 \n \nc.  Collaboration with WHO, NDOH, NACS, and Partners\u2019 Training and \nProtocols \n41.  The public-private partnership arrangements are designed to coordinate with WHO, \nNDOH, NACS, and other partners\u2019 training of health care providers and the development of \nprotocols  for  VCT,  HIV-related  laboratory  activities,  and  treatment.  WHO  is  funding  and \nconducting these activities through a separate project, but the proposed Project is meant to \ncomplement  WHO,  NDOH,  NACS,  and  other  partners\u2019  work  on  training  and  protocols  by \nproviding equipment, supplies, and facilities upgrading in participating enclaves. \n \nd.  Developing Leadership for HIV/AIDS Advocacy \n42.  An important dimension of public\u2013private partnerships for HIV/AIDS prevention is strong \nleadership. The Project will provide additional financial support to UNAIDS (PNG Office) for its \nongoing efforts to develop leadership in HIV/AIDS advocacy by working with national, provincial, \nand district leaders. UNAIDS will also promote the \u201cthree ones\u201d among central, provincial, and \ndistrict  government  agencies,  and  among  all  stakeholders.  The  Project  will  help  UNAIDS \nengage in technical dialogue with churches. \n \n                                                 \n14 ARVs will only be distributed to clinics in the development enclaves that have appropriately trained health staff. \n ", "10  \n2.  Component 2: Community Behavior Change, and Social Marketing of \nCondoms \n43.  Component 2 entails two sets of activities: (i) developing the competency of community \nand civil society organizations to work to address issues related to the HIV epidemic that lead to \nsustainable behavior change, and (ii) the social marketing of condoms throughout the country.  \n \na.  Strengthening Civil Society Organizations to Engage in Community \nBehavior Change \n44.  The Project will strengthen local civil society organizations and local communities in and \naround selected development enclaves to undertake long-term behavior change strategies and \nmonitor behavioral change. The strategies will engage communities and develop HIV prevention \nprograms for the workforce, residents, and settlers to change norms and behaviors to reduce \nexposure  to  HIV  infection.  Target  groups  will  include  the  workforce,  women  who  sell  or \nexchange sex, their main clients/partners, and high-risk youth in the economic enclave and/or \nsurrounding communities. This component will complement the work of the provincial AIDS \ncommittees, the European Union Sexual Health Project, and NHASP.  \n \n45.  The  Project  will  build  the  capacity  of  local  agencies:  NGOs,  community-based \norganizations  (CBOs),  faith-based  organizations  (FBOs),  and  groups  formed  within  the \nworkplace  or  villages,  to  understand  and  manage  the  threat  of  HIV/AIDS.  Private  sector \ncompanies, unions, self-help groups, and others will be engaged to learn the principles of \nbehavior change and how to implement them in their own environments. Wherever possible, \nstructural interventions will be encouraged to complement group and individual behavior change \nprogramming. The behavioral change strategies will be closely linked with the STI treatment, \nVCT, and HIV care activities in component 1, with equipment and training provided to the \npartners.  A  monitoring  system  will  be  developed  so  that  feedback  is  readily  available  for \nanalysis and for adjusting the strategies. \n \n46.  Each community-based sexual risk reduction behavior change program will be culturally \nappropriate and tailored to local communities. This will ensure that specific customary behaviors \nof indigenous groups in the target areas are respected and addressed appropriately. \n \n47.  An  international  NGO  or  company  with  diverse  expertise  in  behavior  change \nprogramming  will  be  engaged  to  work  with  each  development  enclave  and  the  local \ncommunities to develop and implement the targeted behavior change strategies. The contracted \nNGO or company will develop the capacities of economic operators and local groups in the \nfollowing areas: \n \n(i)  main methods of proven behavior change programming; \n(ii)  formative qualitative research in the workplace and surrounding communities; \n(iii)  size estimations of at-risk groups; \n(iv)  baseline and repeat surveys (behavioral and biomarkers, if possible) after which \nthe enclave may be included in the national surveillance system; \n(v)  targeted peer outreach with supervision and support; \n(vi)  provision of \u201csafe space,\u201d e.g., a drop-in or resource center; \n(vii)  materials/media production specific to local lifestyles and beliefs and developed \nby local people; \n(viii)  training health workers on managing clients (attitudes);  ", " 11\n(ix)  providing information on research findings from PNG and suggested from around \nthe world to the local people involved in behavior change programs and others in \nPNG to correct misperceptions related to HIV prevention; and \n(x)  designing training for all stakeholders, including representatives of at-risk groups. \n \nb.  Social Marketing of Condoms \n48.  Changing  high-risk  behavior  requires  that  affordable,  quality  condoms  be  available \nnationwide  (see  Appendix  3).  Pooled  funds  cofinanced  by  ADB  and  the  governments  of \nAustralia and New Zealand will enable a sufficiently large investment to be made for contracting \na professional not-for-profit company to engage in the social marketing and distribution of \ncondoms  for  an  initial  4  years.  The  social  marketing  of  condoms  under  the  Project  will \ncomplement, not replace, existing condom supply mechanisms carried out by NDOH, NAC, and \nthe NHASP, essentially scaling up the effort nationwide and complementing HIV awareness \nefforts.15  \n \n49.  The objectives of a national social marketing program include the following: \n \n(i)  expanded condom sales among the general population and priority target groups \nthrough innovative, research-based, and professional marketing strategies; \n(ii)  improved supply and accessibility of low-priced, high-quality condoms in all parts \nof the country; \n(iii)  more equitable distribution of affordable sexual health products to assure access \nfor rural and low-income groups; \n(iv)  improved levels of adoption of safer sex behaviors among all sectors of society; \nand \n(v)  increased participation of the private sector and public\u2013private partnerships at all \nlevels for wider distribution of social marketing products. \n \n50.  The contracted not-for-profit social marketing company will conduct repeated surveys \nand other forms of research, including in-depth qualitative research and size estimations of at-\nrisk groups, to understand the potential consumers\u2019 beliefs and preferences and coverage \nneeds. An assessment will also be made of the existing condom distribution program for the \n\u201cKaramap\u201d brand, including the potential for integrating it into the national social marketing \nprogram.  The  not-for-profit  company  will  then  develop  a  marketing  strategy  based  on  the \nresearch for (i) the general population, emphasizing rural areas; and (ii) high-risk groups or \nsettings in urban and rural areas. Targeted programs for sex workers, youth, and men who have \nsex with men will also be included within the range of market sub-segments. The not-for-profit \ncompany will develop an efficient, stable, and secure distribution system able to deliver products \nto  urban  and  rural  outlets.  Traditional  outlets  (wholesalers,  pharmacies,  food  stores,  hotel \nshops) and nontraditional outlets (guest houses, small kiosks, night clubs, bars, markets) are \nexpected to be targeted distribution points. Thousands of such distribution points are required.  \n \n51.  All condoms and other commodities for the social marketing program will be procured \nsolely by the not-for-profit company to maintain constant supply and ensure consistent quality. \nMonthly marketing statistics will also be retrieved from a country-wide monitoring system for the \nsocially marketed condoms. The program will include measuring behavior, knowledge, and \nattitude  changes  in  representative  sentinel  sites  throughout  the  country.  The  not-for-profit \n                                                 \n15 The social marketing will also consider the lessons learned from the existing condom distribution programs and \nmay roll them into the Project later. \n ", "12  \ncompany will hire, train, and supervise its own staff members as local teams for the various \nactivities.  \n \n3.  Component 3: Strengthen and Expand Surveillance System for HIV \n52.  Support  will  be  given  to  strengthen  and  expand  PNG\u2019s  current,  but  limited,  sero-\nsurveillance system for HIV/AIDS (see Appendix 4). The initial step will be to facilitate the move \nof the surveillance system from NACS to NDOH as already planned by NACS. This will include \ncapacity building for NDOH to assume HIV/AIDS surveillance. An HIV/AIDS surveillance unit \nwithin the Disease Control Branch of NDOH will be established to focus on sero-surveillance. \nThe Project will review the system and prepare and implement a comprehensive plan to expand \nit to cover in a phased manner all provincial hospital-based antenatal clinics, STI clinics and \nblood banks, selected district hospitals/health centers, and participating enclaves. The plan will \nconsider  how  to  collaborate  with  WHO\u2019s  in-country  health  surveillance  activities  and \ninternational networks. \n \n53.  To  operationalize  the  surveillance  system  at  the  facility  level,  project  activities  will \ninclude providing training and equipment to hospitals, health centers, blood banks, and enclaves \nto conduct HIV/AIDS surveillance and communicate information to the appropriate level of \nauthority. Protocols and reference manuals will be developed under component 3 and provided \nto the participating health facilities. \n \n54.  Complementing the sero-surveillance to be performed by NDOH, the Project will help the \nNational  Research  Institute  (NRI)  develop  technical  capabilities  to  conduct  behavioral \nsurveillance related to HIV and STIs. Consultants and field interviewers will work under NRI to \nconduct behavioral surveillance and institutionalize the capacity at NRI. The Project will provide \nequipment to NRI for behavioral surveillance surveys and related research. Surveillance by NRI \nwill be closely coordinated with NDOH\u2019s forthcoming role in HIV surveillance and feed into \nNACS\u2019s overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.  \n \n55.  An additional activity under component 3 is to support the implementation of the National \nStrategic Plan for Monitoring and Evaluation, 2006\u20132010. The HIV/AIDS surveillance system is \none of several important parts of the overall national HIV/AIDS M&E system planned by NACS, \nand the soon-to-be launched system is only partly funded by AusAID and UNAIDS.  \n \n4.  Component 4: Project Management \n56.  The Project will provide the following support to strengthen project management and \nimplementation:  (i)  coordination  and  management  support,  (ii)  project  performance  M&E \nsystem, (iii) procurement support, (iv) field supervision, and (v) accounting support. Consultants \nwill be engaged to provide these forms of support to NDOH and other involved government \nbodies (Appendix 5). The project coordinator\u2019s functions will include liaison with stakeholders; \ndata and document collection; support of international and domestic consultants; provision of \nlogistics support; assistance in organizing Project training or workshops; provision of necessary \ninformation needed by CCM to review progress and make recommendations; and project M&E. \n \n57.  A  procurement  specialist  will  assist  the  Government\u2019s  Central  Supply  and  Tenders \nBoard and NDOH with all the necessary procurement items and procedures, except the tender \nand selection process for engaging a not-for-profit company to perform social marketing and the \nbehavioral change firm required under component 2. A field supervisor will regularly follow up in \nproject sites\u2014the rural development enclaves and the surrounding communities\u2014to assess ", " 13\nprogress and implementation, identify problems in implementation, and provide reports to the \nstakeholders. An additional accountant will be placed in the HSIP management branch to assist \nin project accounting, disbursements, reconciliation, and other functions. \n \nC.  Special Features \n58.  ADB helped establish the framework and the financial arrangements for a health SWAp \nthrough  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (HSDP).16  From  1998  to  2001,  HSDP \npromoted health sector reforms and linkages between NDOH and the provinces. HSDP also \nfostered stronger NDOH leadership and improved cooperation between development partners. \nBuilding on the success of these initiatives, the Government committed itself to the HSIP, a \nproposed SWAp in the health sector. Billed as the cornerstone in the reform process of the \npublic health sector, HSIP has broad recognition and acceptance by key development partners. \nADB\u2019s association with the development of the SWAp is equally recognized. \n \n59.  The Health Partnership Arrangement, in support of the Government\u2019s steps toward a \nSWAp in the health sector, was signed in November 2004 by the ministers of health, treasury, \nnational planning, and rural development (for the Government), and by AusAID, NZAID, United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and WHO. The \ndocument is not legally binding but rather embodies the aspirations of the DPs for greater \nharmonization and coordination in the sector. ADB plans to sign the document. \n \n60.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  intention  to  become  a  signatory  to  the  Health  Partnership \nArrangement,  the  Project  will  support  the  health  sector  SWAp  to  strengthen  government \nsystems  and  to  endow  NDOH  with  the  capacity  to  undertake  and  monitor  public\u2013private \npartnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Supporting this long-term reform process will require \nconcerted management efforts and some degree of flexibility from all participants. \n \n61.  The Project seeks to attain higher levels of coordination among government, private \nsector,  development  partners,  NGOs,  CBOs,  FBOs,  and  the  affected  communities  by \nemphasizing  partnerships  in  the  response  to  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  Government\u2013private \nsector partnerships have worked successfully in many developing countries but have not been \ntried in PNG. Government agencies involved in HIV/AIDS have not coordinated well in the past, \nand the Project intends to help bridge this gap. The coordination of projects and specific \nactivities of development partners, such as WHO\u2019s VCT training and protocol development in \nrural areas, will result in more efficient use of resources and synergies, in turn fostering greater \nharmonization of activities under a single, broad national framework for HIV/AIDS. \n \n62.  The Project will develop a special relationship with the Global Fund. First, the Project will \nsupport the development of CCM, which was established under the Global Fund to oversee the \nadministration of funds and activities. In addition to capacity building for the planned CCM \nsecretariat,  the  Project\u2019s  activities  give  additional  substance  to  CCM\u2019s  oversight  functions. \nSecond, the public\u2013private partnerships in the development enclaves will provide critical outlets \nfor Global Fund ARVs and rapid HIV test kits in rural areas. Early on, the Government must find \nnumerous qualified facilities in the Global Fund to disseminate the ARVs and test kits. By \nproviding qualified outlets, the Project will enhance the Government\u2019s ability to distribute Global \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1997.

Government support for the social marketing of condoms program (component 2b) is \nstrong, with the endorsement of a consortium of development partners to cofinance this long-\nterm  initiative.  The  consortium  comprises  ADB,  Government,  AusAID  and  NZAID,  is  non-\nexclusive, and may accept other cofinanciers at any time. This collaborative mechanism is \ndesigned  to  ensure  stability  and  sustainability  for  as  long  as  the  epidemic  persists.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to lead in engaging the not-for-profit social marketing firm and \nmanaging the contract to help insulate this critical public health intervention from influences \noutside best practices in public health. NZAID and AusAID have indicated their staunch support \nfor ADB to undertake the contracting and administration of the social marketing firm contract. \nRecognizing the complementary objectives of the two subcomponents under component 2, \nGovernment has requested that the international NGO/consulting firm for behavior change also \nbe engaged and administered by ADB. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n64.  Total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties,  is \nestimated to be $25 million. About 42%, or $10.5 million, of the project cost is in foreign \nexchange, and 58% ($14.5 million equivalent) is in local currency (Table 1). Cost estimates by \ncomponent and by financier appear in Appendix 6 and procurement packages are in Appendix \n7.17 \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates by Component  \n($ million) \nComponent    Foreign  Local  Total \n         \nA.

Financing Plan \n65.  ADB will provide a grant of $15 million from the Asian Development Fund to help finance \nthe Project. The Government\u2019s cost sharing, including cofinancing from other development \npartners, will cover the remaining $10 million. The Government\u2019s direct contribution amounts to \n                                                 \n17 The project cost estimates and its presentation in the RRP were negotiated and finally agreed at grant negotiations \nwith the Government prior to the issuance of the staff instructions on \u2018Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures \nfor Asian Development Bank Financing\u2019.

Cofinancing totaling $7 million from the \ngovernments of Australia ($3.5 million) and New Zealand ($3.5 million) for the social marketing \nof condoms subcomponent will be provided on a grant basis and will be administered by ADB. \nIn the event that further bilateral or other assistance materializes during project implementation, \nall parties have accepted that this could be used to offset the Government\u2019s direct counterpart \nfunding obligations. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($\u2018000) \n \n  Foreign  Local \nTotal  Percentage \nSources  Exchange  Cost \n         \nADB Grant  8,549.5  6,450.5  15,000.0  60 \nGovernment of PNG  0.0  3,000.0  3,000.0  12 \nGovernment of Australia  986.9  2,513.1  3,500.0  14 \nGovernment of New Zealand  986.9  2,513.1  3,500.0  14 \n  Total Cost to be Financed  10,523.3  14,476.7  25,000.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PNG = Papua New Guinea. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n66.  NDOH has a policy of harmonizing and integrating projects into regular services and not \ncreating separate project management units. The Project will therefore be implemented under \nthe umbrella of the HSIP, the national SWAp for health sector development. The HSIP systems \nwere originally established in 1998 under the ADB-supported HSDP, and later extended to allow \nother development partners to include their funds in the SWAp.18 The HSIP (formerly HSDP) \ntrust account has been a success since 1998. This secure channel of provincial health funding \noperates parallel to Government financial systems but follows nearly identical procedures, and \nis highly regarded by Government and development partners. The HSIP management branch \nmanages funds from the Global Fund, AusAID, NZAID, and ADB. The HSIP was critical in \nsecuring Global Fund monies for malaria (round 2) and HIV/AIDS (round 4). NDOH manages \nthe HSIP in partnership with development partners. Accounting is supported by an international \naccounting firm, reporting is monthly, and HSIP operations are subject to regular audits. It is \nincreasingly owned by NDOH. \n \n67.  NDOH will be the project Executing Agency, and together with the project coordinator \n(an individual consultant based within NDOH) will work in close association with the HSIP in all \nmatters of project administration, as well as with CCM. Exceptionally, so as not to overburden \nthe NDOH and HSIP in an area where they lack expertise and experience, and in recognition of \nthe special arrangement established by the consortium of development partners to cofinance \nand support the social marketing of condoms program, the Government has requested that ADB \nengage the consultant for the behavioral change and communication program and the social \nmarketing  of  condoms  program  and  administer  both  contracts  under  component  2.  The \nGovernment has also requested that all reporting by contractors of ADB be provided to NDOH \nand CCM. \n \n                                                 \n18 See Loan 1516-PNG/1517-PNG (SF) and the associated investment loan, Loan 1518-PNG(SF). ADB has funds in \nthe HSIP trust account. \n ", "16  \n68.  At the joint request of the Government, AusAID, and NZAID, ADB will engage the \nconsultants  and  administer  the  consultancy  services  under  the  two  consultancy  contracts \nrequired  for  component  2.  ADB  will  also  institute  all  operational  links  between  these  two \nconsultancy contracts. For the contracted companies, the framework of general terms and \nconditions contained in the TA framework agreement (6 May 1996) between the Government \nand ADB will apply. \n \n69.  CCM will review progress and guide project implementation, ensuring that management \nand resource efficiencies are achieved with the Global Fund. The secretary of health chairs \nCCM. ADB has been given an active seat on CCM. CCM  meetings will be held at least \nquarterly. The Project will help support and develop the CCM secretariat. CCM has functioning \ntechnical working groups for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The group for HIV/AIDS will review and \nadvise on the Project\u2019s technical aspects. \n \n70.  NDOH will review and be a signatory to partnership arrangements embodied in MOAs \nbetween the Government and (i) rural economic operators, (ii) civil society organizations, and \n(iii)  any  other  related  agencies,  covering  respective  responsibilities  in  relation  to  project \nobjectives and activities. \n \n71.  The Project will be implemented by NDOH, NACS, provincial and district health offices, \nhospitals and health facilities, NRI, WHO, UNAIDS, NGOs, a not-for-profit social marketing \ncompany,  a  firm  for  behavioral  change,  and  participating  economic  operators  (see \nimplementation arrangements and structures in Appendix 8). NDOH will be responsible for \nimplementing a comprehensive, nationwide HIV surveillance system. NACS will facilitate a \nseamless and timely transfer of existing data and files of the current HIV surveillance system to \nNDOH. NDOH and NACS will cooperate in the production and distribution of data and analytical \ninformation on the evolution of, and response to, the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Implementation of the \nnational  M&E  system  will  be  supported  by  the  UN\u2019s  joint  program  for  an  HIV/AIDS  M&E \nenhancement support project. The Project will support and contribute to the implementation of \nthe M&E system by working with this joint program. NRI\u2019s behavioral surveillance will also feed \ninto the overall M&E system. \n \n72.  ADB will select the not-for-profit social marketing company in conformity with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines. The consultancy selection committee will evaluate the proposals using a quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method.  ADB  will  transfer  the  installment  payments  directly  to  the \ncontracted  not-for-profit  company  upon  clearance  being  given  by  its  Pacific  Regional \nDepartment. \n \n73.  The  Project  will  develop  the  capacity  of  NDOH  to  negotiate  with  the  participating \neconomic operators to establish individual public\u2013private partnerships. A template MOA will be \nused to define respective roles and responsibilities, inputs, and expected outputs. Subsidiary \npublic\u2013private relationships will also be included to capture the network of participants involved \nin the response to HIV/AIDS. \n \n74.  Under  the  MOA  with  selected  rural  economic  operators,  rural  health  facilities  in \ncommunities around the development enclaves will be rehabilitated to provide primary health \ncare services, including prevention of HIV, VCT, and care of people with HIV. The economic \noperators will provide oversight and manage the partnerships with the public health facilities in \ntheir  communities  and  provide  health  services  to  their  employees  and  the  surrounding \ncommunities. \n ", " 17\n75.  The Project will help NDOH support and/or contract selected NGOs, CBOs, and FBOs in \ndelivering and/or training in HIV prevention, VCT, treatment and care, including home-based \ncare. Evidence-based performance will guide the selection process of NGOs, CBOs, and FBOs \nengaged to assist NDOH. \n \n76.  In  matters  related  to  the  development  of  counseling,  testing,  treatment,  and  care \nprotocols, and adaptation for implementation in one or more PNG contexts, WHO will help \nNDOH  establish  standards  to  be  applied  under  the  Project.  Similarly,  in-service  training \nprograms of the above functions will be facilitated by WHO under the responsibility of NDOH. \nThe Project will support and make use of NDOH\u2013WHO competencies in VCT, treatment, and \ncare training, including home-based care. \n \n77.  The Project will work with NDOH, WHO, and provincial hospitals to develop hospital \nreferral centers patterned on the model established by the Heduru Clinic at PMGH. The Project \nwill  also  help  develop  public\u2013private  partnerships  between  provincial  hospitals  and  rural \neconomic operators. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n78.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, and is expected to start in February 2006 \nand end in January 2010. The first 3 months will focus on fielding consultants and recruiting \nstaff, reviewing baseline data for M&E, detailed project planning, engaging consultants for the \nsocial marketing and behavioral change subcomponents, and signing and activating MOAs \nbetween the Government and economic operators. The implementation schedule is in Appendix \n9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n79.  Grant-financed civil works, goods and materials will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Project civil works are small and limited to the repair and \nupgrade of existing facilities, requiring no land acquisition. The small civil works are unlikely to \nattract foreign bidders, and therefore civil works will be awarded through local competitive \nbidding or, where circumstances warrant and for contracts valued at under $100,000, through \nthe direct selection of those economic operators participating in the Project. The Government \nwill submit details of the number and scope of civil works for ADB approval before withdrawing \nfunds for civil works expenditures. \n \n80.  Goods and materials valued at $1 million or more will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding,  and  those  valued  at  over  $100,000  and  under  $1  million  will  use \ninternational shopping or local competitive bidding. Direct procurement may be used when \nbuying small off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n81.  International  and  local  consultants  will  be  recruited,  either  as  companies  or  as \nindividuals, to implement certain aspects of the Project. The consultants will be engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n82.  Individual international consultants will be engaged by NDOH for the following positions: \n(i)  project  coordinator,  (ii)  HIV  sero-surveillance  specialist/epidemiologist,  (iii)  behavioral \n ", "18  \nsurveillance specialist, and (iv) procurement specialist. (See Appendix 9 for the number of \nperson-months for each position.) \n \n83.  Individual domestic consultants will be engaged, also by NDOH, to fill the following \npositions: (i) project accountant; (ii) field supervisor; (iii) trainer supervisors for surveillance; (iv) \nstatistician; (v) data entry clerks; and (vi) interviewers. (See Appendix 9 for the number of \nperson-months for each position.) \n \n84.  Two international companies will be engaged by ADB under component 2. ADB will also \nadminister both contracts. Under the first contract, a company will be engaged to design, train, \nsupervise, and monitor the behavior change programs carried out through local NGOs, CBOs,  \nFBOs, and communities. Under the second contract, a company will be engaged to design the \nplan for, and then conduct the social marketing of condoms. The condoms and related supplies \nfor the social marketing program will be procured by the contracted company. Contenders for \nboth  contracts  under  component  2  are  expected  to  include  not-for-profit  companies  and \ninternational NGOs. These consultants will be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection method. \n \n85.  NDOH will ensure that qualified staff members are assigned to the Project, and any \nvoids will be filled with additional qualified consultants. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n86.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy19  was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nNDOH. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the grant regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the NDOH and all contracts, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n87.  All funds originating from the cofinanciers, i.e., the governments of Australia and New \nZealand, will be paid to ADB and will be used exclusively for meeting payments to the not-for-\nprofit company engaged under component 2 (ii) for the social marketing of condoms. At the \nrequest of the Government of PNG, ADB will take responsibility for administering the funds \nprovided by Australia and New Zealand, and for managing the social marketing contract. \n \n88.  All proceeds of the grant not required for component 2 of the Project may be disbursed \nthrough the imprest account, which may be pooled in the HSIP trust account, which operates \nunder the oversight of the HSIP management branch. All proceeds of the grant thus deposited \nin the imprest account (within the HSIP trust account) shall be managed, replenished, and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook20  (January  2001),  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed on between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be \n                                                 \n19   ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy: Description . Manila. \n20   ADB. 2001. AB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila ", " 19\ndeposited into the HSIP trust account shall be based on the estimated expenditures for the first \n6 months of project implementation, not exceeding the ceiling of $1 million. \n \n89.  Using the funds deposited into the imprest account (within the HSIP trust account), the \nHSIP management branch will undertake procurement on behalf of NDOH, NACS, UNAIDS, \nqualified NGOs, FBOs, CBOs, participating private economic operators, and any other relevant \nparties based on arrangements under approved MOAs (see flow of funds in Appendix 10).  \n \n90.  The imprest account is for the sole use of this Project. Since the imprest account is \npooled within HSIP trust account, all funds through the imprest account need to be recorded \nseparately, accounted for, and audited. NDOH, with the supervision of the department\u2019s external \nauditor, will submit to ADB the liquidation of all expenditures for the Imprest Account quarterly or \nmore frequently, depending on the use of the funds. A statement of expenditures (SOE) and \nproject  financial  report  showing  the  source  and  use  of  funds,  certified  by  the  project \ndirector/manager or the representatives of the Project and endorsed by the external auditor \nshall be attached to the withdrawal application. Any amount not disbursed from the imprest \naccount or any amount not disbursed for an eligible expenditure will be returned to ADB in the \ncurrency of the original payment (US dollars). \n \n91.  The  EA,  through  the  HSIP  management  branch  director,  will  formulate  expenditure \nestimates for each year of implementation based on project activities. The budgets will be \nreviewed and updated quarterly. All budgets will be reviewed and approved by CCM before \nimplementation. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), the \nSOE procedure will be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating advances to \nthe  HSIP  trust  account  to  ensure  speedy  project  implementation.  The  ceiling  on  SOE  is \n$100,000 per payment. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n92.  The Government will ensure that sound accounting and auditing standards according to \ninternationally accepted practices are applied by NDOH and all other project implementing \nagencies. The HSIP trust account is subjected to rigorous annual audits by a professional \nauditing firm. These audit reports will be made available to the Government, ADB, CCM, NDOH, \nand all implementing agencies. Accounting will be carried out by HSIP management branch with \nguidance from the Department of Finance. Annual audits of all NDOH activity will be conducted \nby the auditor general or delegated to a professional auditing firm operating under the auspices \nof the auditor general.  \n \n93.  The HSIP secretariat will submit the auditors\u2019 reports, copies of the certified accounts, \nand related financial statements, including auditors\u2019 opinions on the use of grant proceeds, \ncompliance with grant covenants, and the SOE procedure to ADB within 6 months after the \nclose of each fiscal year. \n \n94.  All  implementing  agencies  will  provide  quarterly  reports  to  NDOH.  NDOH  will  then \nsubmit quarterly progress reports on project implementation to CCM, ADB, and other relevant \nstakeholders. The EA will prepare the reports and address necessary improvements for project \nactivities and institutional development aspects of the Project. The quarterly progress reports \nwill have information on the physical progress of activities, status of compliance with grant \ncovenants, organizational and financial issues, the proposed program of activities, and expected \nprogress in the next 3 months. The reports will be widely disseminated and shared with all \nstakeholders. \n ", "20  \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n95.  Data  will  be  collected  to  monitor  progress  in  achieving  the  project  objectives. \nSpecifically, the EA and the project coordinator will jointly develop a project performance M&E \nsystem that will provide the Government, ADB, AusAID, and NZAID with information on (i) \ntechnical  performance  of  the  Project;  (ii)  measures  of  project  impact,  including  social  and \neconomic benefits; and (iii) progress toward targets and goals identified in the project design \nand monitoring framework and the MTDS. Some baseline data already exist, such as the \nquarterly routine case reporting and periodic sentinel surveillance activities, the report of the \n2004 National Consensus Workshop, AIDS indicator surveys, 2000 demographic and health \nsurvey, NHASP surveys and reports, reports from the four STI clinics (Mt. Hagen, Port Moresby, \nGoroka,  and  Lae),  and  others.  When  necessary,  particularly  in  the  enclaves  and  the \nsurrounding communities, the Project will conduct baseline surveys within the first year of \noperations. The social marketing not-for-profit company will also conduct its own research to \nestablish  baselines  and  subsequent  measures  throughout  the  project.  All  reports  will  be \nsubmitted by the EA to CCM, ADB, AusAID, NZAID, and other key development partners \nthroughout project implementation; these reports will include indicators of project completion, \ndelivery, and benefits. \n \n9.  Project Review \n96.  CCM will include the Project in its own quarterly reviews. In addition, ADB and CCM \n(which includes Government representation) will jointly carry out project supervisory missions \nevery  6  months.  Before  each  visit,  a  progress  report  will  be  updated.  ADB  reviewers  will \nexamine records of M&E activities and meet with central and local governments, community \nleaders, and project beneficiaries. Two years after the Project starts, CCM will undertake a \ncomprehensive midterm review to (i) examine the scope, design, implementation arrangements, \nand other relevant issues in light of the Government\u2019s development of HIV/AIDS strategies and \npolicies;  (ii)  assess  the  Project's  progress  and  achievement  of  the  objectives;  (iii)  identify \nproblems and constraints; and (iv) recommend any required modifications, restructuring, and \nreallocations. The Government will issue invitations to ADB, AusAID, and NZAID to participate \nin this midterm review. \n   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n97.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries. Improvements in labor quality and productivity \nresulting from decreased infectious diseases will lead to accelerated economic growth. The \nWHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 2001 suggested that \u201c\u2026investments in \nhealth should be a central part of an overall development and poverty reduction strategy,\u201d as \neach 10% improvement in life expectancy at birth is associated with an increase in economic \ngrowth of at least 0.3\u20130.4% per year. Hence, the project outcomes should be better general \nhealth  status,  reduced  poverty  because  of  higher  economic  growth,  and  progress  toward \nachieving the HIV/AIDS-related millennium development goal (see Appendix 11). \n \n98.  The Project\u2019s economic benefits will come from (i) public and private savings in health \nexpenditures,  mainly  from  prevention  of  HIV  and  endemic  diseases  but  also  from  early \ntreatment of infections; (ii) productivity gains from an increased lifespan and reduced mortality; \nand  (iii)  productivity  gains  from  improved  education  achievements,  especially  through  less \nabsenteeism and reduced dropout rates.  ", " 21\n99.  The Project aims to improve the health of the rural poor, focusing on primary health care \nand community-based HIV prevention. Low-income people are more likely to be exposed to \nhigher risks of HIV infection for several reasons, mainly because they enter into sex work more \noften than higher-income people, incur STIs that are often left untreated, are more exposed to \nreused needles, and more often receive transfusions of untested blood. HIV-positive pregnant \nwomen have less access to services that prevent transmission to babies. By increasing the \nmeans available for reducing the risks of HIV infection among the highest-risk groups, the \nProject  will  increase  the  likelihood  that  low-income  people  will  reduce  their  own  risks  for \ninfection. While generally men, women, and children will benefit equally from greater access to \nhealth care, women and children will be major beneficiaries of these expanded services in \nenclaves that employ mostly men and do not provide health services to their families. Female \nsex workers in the communities will be a major target for behavior change programming, and \nthey will receive greater access to STI treatment and condoms. Children will particularly benefit \nfrom expanded immunization services provided by either the enclave clinics or the restarted \npublic health facilities. Even if households are not poor before a member contracts HIV, loss of \nemployment and the high cost of treatment will push many deep into poverty. \n \n100.  Sustainability.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  the  potential  for \nsustainability  given  the  limited  time  of  the  grant  and  the  need  for  greater  Government \ncommitment to the HIV response. Should the efficiencies of the cost-sharing arrangements and \nthe assigned responsibilities under component 1 be respected, and the partnerships prove to be \nbeneficial  to  all  parties,  they  will  more  likely  be  sustainable.  The  partnerships  intend  to \n\u201cformalize\u201d this link between the Government and private sector at the community level, as they \nboth have mutually reinforcing interests in preventing the spread of HIV. The MOAs between \nthem  will  be  structured  to  encourage  sustainable  cooperation  and  help  strengthen  the \ncommitment of each party. Under component 2, the behavior change strategies linked to the \npublic\u2013private partnerships will be reviewed in terms of reduction in morbidity and mortality. The \nevaluation of the strategies will inform decisions to continue and expand this intervention. \n \n101.  Other measures incorporated to enhance sustainability include the following:  \n \n(i)  An  effective  social  marketing  of  condoms  program  will  be  required  for  the \nduration of the epidemic (under component 2). By establishing a consortium of \ndevelopment partners to cofinance and support an independent, professional \nnot-for-profit company to establish and run the social marketing program, this \nessential HIV prevention intervention becomes a collaborative effort and less \ndependent on any single partner\u2019s decision to continue after 4 years or not. The \nrelative  levels  of  participation  by  Government  and  individual  development \npartners  may  change  over  time,  while  the  sustainability  of  the  program  is \nensured. \n(ii)  The  social  marketing  of  condoms  program,  supported  by  the  Government, \nAusAID, NZAID, and ADB, is an opportunity to work together on a unified public \nhealth intervention supporting concerted and coordinated action. The consortium \nand  cofinance  modalities  and  arrangements  should  be  examined  during  the  \nmidterm review to access their long-term viability beyond the life of the Project. \nAll cofinanciers should participate in the eventual restructure exercise to ensure \nthe sustainability of the condom social marketing program and its transition to full \nGovernment ownership. \n(iii)  Strengthening and expanding systems and participating sentinel sites comes \nunder  component  3.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  the  systems  will  require \ndeveloping  appropriately  trained  and  committed  NDOH  and  NRI  counterpart \n ", "22  \nstaff. While the initial costs to establish functioning systems are borne by the \nProject, the long-term supervisory and maintenance costs of the surveillance \nsystem are important and must be included in NDOH and NRI annual plans and \nrecurrent budgets. \n(iv)  Under  component  4,  the  project  coordinator,  procurement  specialist,  field \nsupervisor, and project accountant will work within the HSIP management branch \nwhere  they  will  endeavor  to  strengthen  the  skills  and  competencies  of \ngovernment staff through association and participation in all activities. NDOH \nmanagement will be similarly associated with all partnership negotiations and \narrangements as well as in M&E. The competencies developed by NDOH will \nensure the establishment of new (post-project) public-private partnerships in the \nGovernment\u2019s continued comprehensive response to the HIV epidemic. \n \n102.  Social and Gender Analysis. Gender issues loom large in the HIV situation. The social \nand economic status of women is very low, and poverty motivates many women to sell or \nexchange sex for cash and other goods or services. The epidemic has been rather evenly \ndivided among males and females from its inception, but recently infections among females of \nthe age group 15\u201325 have been rising disproportionately. The burden of caring for the sick and \nproviding food for families falls heavily on women. A few organizations have been working to \nimprove women\u2019s rights but little progress is evident.  \n \n103.  Environment. The Project is categorized as \u201cC\u201d and should not have significant adverse \nenvironmental effects. In general, the Project will finance preventive medical activities and rapid \nblood testing, which leave limited by-products. The Government also has regulations on medical \nwaste management. Project supervision will closely monitor the issue of medical wastes. \n \nB.  Risks  \n104.  Health  Sector  Improvement  Program.  The  Project  will  strive  to  work  within  and \nstrengthen HSIP systems, but an alternative mechanism may be needed if the HSIP becomes \ndysfunctional. \n \n105.  Commitment to Health Sector Reform. PNG\u2019s health system over the past several \nyears has become less and less able to provide services, especially at the community level, \nbecause of insufficient supplies, inadequate supervision, and large numbers of nonperforming \nhealth staff members on the payroll. Extensive reform of the health system is necessary but \nunlikely to occur soon. The new public\u2013private partnership approach to be initiated under the \nProject is a new strategy for PNG to overcome the limitations of public health finance and \nnonperforming health staff members. The partnership approach must have full Government \nbacking to ensure its success. \n \n106.  Limited  Absorptive  Capacity.  A  major  concern  is  the  Government\u2019s  absorptive \ncapacity for the large influx of funds from the Global Fund, ongoing AusAID support, and the \nproposed ADB Asian Development Fund grant. The amount of funds to be dispersed and the \nnumber  of  program  and  project  activities  under  the  health  sector  could  pose  significant \nchallenges to the Government at all levels. \n \n107.  Increasing  Economic  Hardship.  A  worsening  economic  situation  will  drive  more \nwomen  into  transactional  sex  and  high-risk  behavior.  Behavioral  change  programming  in \ncommunities and for targeted groups such as sex workers is expected to be effective in altering ", " 23\nhigh-risk  behavior.  Behavioral  change  will  be  reinforced  by  the  widespread  availability  of \ncondoms through the social marketing program. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Special Assurances \n108.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government will give, or cause to be given, \ncertain assurances for inclusion in the Grant Agreement. Among these will be the following: \n \n(i)  Annual  national  budgets.  The  Government,  through  the  Department  of \nTreasury  and  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Rural  Development  has \nensured/will  ensure  that  $3.9  million  (in  kina  equivalent),  including  its  own \ncounterpart funds, has appeared/will appear in the national budget for FY2006 as \nbeing allocated for the Project. The Government will take the required measures \nat the appropriate times to ensure that the Project\u2019s budget is taken into account \nin the Government\u2019s annual planning and budgeting process, and included in all \nnational budgets through to and including FY2010. \n \n(ii)  HIV  surveillance  system  and  surveillance  personnel.  The  Government, \nthrough  NDOH,  will  support  and  maintain  at  least  the  same  number  of \nsurveillance sites and surveillance personnel as exist at the completion of the \nProject for a minimum of 4 years after the Project\u2019s completion. \n \n(iii)  Waiver  of import  duties  and  taxes.  The  Government,  through  the  Internal \nRevenue Commission, will ensure that all health hardware items (e.g., condoms \nand  personal  lubricants)  for  the  Project\u2019s  social  marketing  component  are \nimported into PNG free of all taxes and duties, and released promptly to the \nconsulting company engaged by ADB to administer this subcomponent. \n \n(iv)  Recurrent budget for HIV/AIDS prevention. The Government will ensure that \nits recurrent allocation for HIV/AIDS prevention in its annual budget will increase \nby 20% year on year throughout the life of the Project. \n \n(v)  Project  steering  committee.  The  CCM  created  for  the  Global  Fund  will \nconstitute a steering committee for the Project. The Government will ensure that \nthe  CCM  will  at  regular  intervals  review  progress  and  guide  implementation \nunder the Project. \n \n(vi)  Hospital referral centers. The Government will roll out three regional referral \ncenters for STIs and HIV/AIDS at Mt. Hagen, Angau Memorial, and Nonga Base \nHospitals, in addition to Heduru Clinic at PMGH. \n \n(vii)  Local health facilities and the private sector. The Government will take all \nsteps  to  ensure  the  smooth  and  timely  delivery  of  all  management  and \nsupervisory assistance pledged to local health facilities by economic operators in \nparticipating rural development enclaves pursuant to their respective MOAs with \nthe Government. \n \n ", "24  \nEnvironmental considerations. The Government, through NDOH, will ensure that the \nrehabilitation and operation of all health facilities involved in the Project comply with all \napplicable laws and regulations of Papua New Guinea and ADB\u2019s environment policy.21  \n \nB.  Condition for Grant Effectiveness \n109.  Grant effectiveness will be dependent upon ADB, AusAID, and NZAID reaching mutually \nsatisfactory  understandings  with  each  other  and  with  the  Government  with  regard  to  the \nnecessary cofinancing. The execution of a written agreement or agreements recording the \nagreed arrangements will be a condition for the effectiveness of the Grant Agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n110.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)   the grant not exceeding the equivalent of $15,000,000 to the Independent State \nof Papua New Guinea, from the Asian Development Fund, for the HIV/AIDS \nPrevention and Control in Rural Development Enclaves Project, with terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nGrant Agreement presented to the Board; \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 \nto the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for the purpose of the social \nmarketing  of  condoms  subcomponent  of  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of Australia on a grant basis; and \n \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 \nto the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for the purpose of the social \nmarketing  of  condoms  subcomponent  of  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of New Zealand on a grant basis. \n \n \n \n \n                   Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n28 March 2006 \n \n                                                 \n21   ADB. 2002.

With a rapidly increasing HIV epidemic, Papua New Guinea (PNG) has inadequately \ninvested in effective modes of prevention.1 Despite over a decade of HIV control activities, \nprevalence continues to rise. Transmission through unsafe sex is the primary mode in PNG, \nindicating a great need of increased and improved condom use. In spite of a recent effort at \nsocial marketing for both condom use and reduction of stigma, condom use has not risen \nsignificantly and over half of all people surveyed in follow-up market surveys believe HIV-\npositive people \u201cdeserve what they get.\u201d Churches and others continue to resist the use of \ncondoms; accredited voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers can be found that refuse to \npromote or give out condoms even to positive persons married to negative spouses. This lack of \nsupport for condom promotion is evidence of the positioning of ideology over evidence-based \npublic  health  strategies,  a  situation  not  restricted  to  PNG  but  one  with  dangerous \nconsequences. Active education of stakeholders and the populace requires a major effort to \ncounter such negative influences. \n \nA.  Why Social Marketing? \n \n2.  In a rigorous review of HIV/AIDS prevention strategies, the Cochrane Collaboration, a \nnonpartisan international organization that prepares and promotes scientific reviews of public \nhealth strategies, found that programs that included the distribution of male condoms for AIDS \nprevention were effective interventions in high-risk groups and the general population.2 \n \n3.  The concept of social marketing was invented by a public health expert in India over 30 \nyears ago and adapted by a person working for CARE in India. The first demonstration was with \nfamily planning commodities. It has evolved and grown, and now has several iterations. Social \nmarketing of one or more branded condoms, carried out by professionals, has had remarkable \nsuccess in many countries. Internationally successful social marketing companies work with the \nprivate sector and cooperate with government. \n \n4.  The main aim is to make a health product attractive and commonly used, just as a \ncompany might do with toothpaste. The aim is not to scare people into using the product, nor is \nit to moralize about their behavior; it is very simply driven by the aim to sell the product, with the \nknowledge that doing so, in the case of condoms, means providing protection against HIV and \nSTIs for whole populations. For this reason, delivering condoms into every possible outlet in all \nurban and rural areas is extremely important as it helps to desensitize the product on a national \nbasis.  \n \n5.  Social  marketing  messages  or  packaging  are  not  determined  by  bureaucrats  or \nauthorities. They are determined by the consumer through research, segmented into different \nmarkets, in order to follow the best practices of marketing in the private sector. These products \nare for sale in the formal and informal marketplace and have to compete with others in that \nmarket.  The  largest  social  marketing  companies  have  managed  to  be  successful  even  in \nCatholic and Islamic countries where objections have been loud and vocal. The best social \nmarketing  companies  find  ways  to  manage  their  relationships  with  government  and  other \nstakeholders to enable the success of a product.  \n \n                                                 \n1  A full version of this appendix is in the supplementary appendixes, which are available upon request. \n2  The Cochrane Collaborative Review Group on HIV Infection and AIDS. 2004. Evidence Assessment: Strategies for \nHIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care.  (January). \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n6.  Over time, in most countries, condom promotion leads to significant levels of condom \nuse, often beginning with the most at-risk groups. In less at-risk groups, both partner reduction \nand condom use contribute to a significant reduction in risk.  \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n \n7.  Condom use, in conjunction with the reduction of partners, has repeatedly been shown \nto have significant impact on generalized HIV epidemics. Various mechanisms have been tried \nfor the distribution and sale of condoms to increase use, and gradually key lessons learned from \naround the world and in PNG have been accumulated.  \n \n8.  The  purchase  of  condoms  at  low,  subsidized  prices  is  more  effective  and  more \nsustainable than free distribution. When people purchase condoms at easily accessible and \nconvenient locations, their use is more likely than when they are distributed free. This has been \nshown in a national study in Cameroon that examined the issue and found that free condoms \nwere easier to access for those who never had tried condoms before, but socially marketed low-\nprice condoms were preferred by all others and was associated with greater actual use.3 In \nPNG, free public sector condoms are often not distributed at all and sit on shelves until they \nexpire. \n \n9.  For  a  large  social  marketing  program  to  be  successful,  government  must  be  fully \ncommitted and supportive. Greater understanding of the nonprofit nature of this type of effort \nmust be assured. Funding mechanisms must be simplified and smooth, with no chance of \ndelays  that  will  interrupt  activities  or  supplies.  Condom  and  other  commodities  must  be \npurchased by the social marketing company in order to maintain control of supply and quality. \nAnd there must be long-term commitment. \n \n10.  Resistance to the promotion of condoms among village leaders and church spokesmen \nis widespread. The alternative they offer, abstinence, has not been shown to be a preferred or \nstatistically effective strategy.4 Also, there are no studies or other evidence to support the \nideologically motivated assertion that condoms promote promiscuity. A recent review of the \nresearch in condom distribution, condom promotion, and sexual health education interventions \nand their effects on sexual behavior by Christian Aid, the official relief and development agency \nof 40 British and Irish church denominations, found ample evidence that these interventions do \n\u201cnot hasten sexual debut or increase the number of sexual partners\u201d and that \u201cused correctly, \ncondoms  are  effective  in  preventing  HIV  infection  among  young  people  who  are  sexually \nactive.\u201d5 \n \n11.  Another lesson learned is that social marketing programs that aim to recoup costs have \na record of failure, including an earlier project run by the Futures Group in PNG. The better \nprograms depend on donor subsidies but use the full panoply of private sector marketing \ntechniques, including extensive in-depth research repeated throughout the entire life of the \nproject. \n \n                                                 \n3 D.

The latest social marketing effort in PNG has faced a number of problems. First, when \nbegun in 2000, it was located within the NACS and had an intermittent consultant. Message \ndevelopment was reportedly highly constrained in that WHO prescribed what should be the \nmain  message  (ABC:  abstinence,  be  faithful,  or  use  condoms)  rather  than  permitting  the \ndevelopment of messages from the minds and voices of the populace. Abstinence may have \nhad multilayered meanings to the WHO or the consultant (e.g., delay) but the message was \ntranslated into \u201dNo ken kuap,\u201d which in Pidgin simply means \u201cDon\u2019t have sex\u201d\u2014not a preferred \noption in any study of responses to AIDS education, despite numerous countries\u2019 attempts to \nuse this message.  \n \n13.  Universally, a  \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to communication about sexual behavior has \nbeen repeatedly shown to fail. The ABC message does not suit the vast majority of adults, tends \nto be sex-negative, only promotes condom use for those with multiple partners, and incorrectly \nleads people to believe that simply being faithful to one partner is protective. Other messages \nused  in  the  current  program  reinforce  the  often-heard  incorrect  notion  that  pamuk  pasin \n(promiscuity)\u2014as  opposed  to  unsafe  sex\u2014is  the  culprit  in  the  spread  of  HIV,  further \nstigmatizing and marginalizing those in greatest need of services. Overall, the messages used \ndo not reflect the real nature of sexual behavior in PNG and therefore have not \u201cstruck home.\u201d \n \n14.  The  current  campaign  in  PNG  has  been  largely  urban-biased  (as  has  been  the \nmonitoring) and has never directed any messages, visually or verbally, to the conditions of life in \nmost rural areas, where most HIV-infected people live. While sports stars were used in media \ncampaigns, their influence can hardly be considered national, in that TV media reaches a very \nsmall proportion of the country. \n \n15.  At least an equally great problem appears to be the availability of condoms where and \nwhen people need them. Distribution of the branded \u201cKaramap\u201d condom has been problematic. \nIt is difficult to find these condoms in stores in larger urban areas, such as Madang or Daru, let \nalone  in  rural  spots.  The  latest  survey  (March  2005)  from  the  NHASP-supported  social \nmarketing campaign found that 29% of people surveyed disagreed and 37% agreed they could \nfind condoms when they perceived they needed to. Even trained peer educators, trained under \neither the European Union Sexual Health or the NHASP programs, have no steady supply of \ncondoms to sell.  \n \n16.  Other key lessons learned so far in PNG include the following: \n \n(i)  Prices were not controlled, and at some places in Port Moresby the supposedly \nsubsidized condom pack was being sold for K2.  \n(ii)  Frequently NGOs purchase condoms and then give them to retail outlets to give \nout free, as do provincial AIDS committees. Retailers complain that it makes no \nsense for people to purchase condoms if the same branded condom is widely \ndistributed  free.  Much  confusion  and  uncontrolled  pricing  as  well  as  the \npositioning of public versus private sector condoms have marred this recent \nsocial marketing effort. \n(iii)  Other reasons for the lack of progress in condom acceptability and usage appear \nto be related to the frequently documented discordance between knowledge and \nbehavior as well as intention and behavior. \n(iv)  The  social  marketing  work  was  further  handicapped  by  directing  part  of  its \nresources to a media campaign to diminish stigma. Worldwide this has never \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nworked and the most effective means has been shown in numerous studies to \ninvolve face-to-face contact with HIV-positive people.6  \n \n17.  It is fair to say that an inadequate investment in highly professional social marketing \nexpertise underlies the results of the program. Although the major components were similar to \nthat done elsewhere, the level of investment did not allow the intensity of high-quality research, \nor the number of personnel needed for promotion, sales, and distribution that might have \ndirected decision making in a different way at an earlier date. It is also clear that prior research \non  the  same  topics  were  not  used  in  preparing  the  research  and  message  development \ncomponents.  \n \nC.  Restarting the effort \n \n18.  While the promotion of condom use may not be the only valuable behavioral strategy, \nwithout a massive effort at getting condoms to the people where and when they need them at \nvery low prices, it is unlikely that the epidemic can be contained. It is proposed that a large \ninvestment in social marketing is made so as to attract an internationally known social marketing \nagency. For several reasons, a major aim must be the promotion and distribution of condoms in \nrural areas: (i) nearly all major economic enclaves, sites of high risk, are in rural or even remote \nrural areas; (ii) studies conducted under the auspices of the WHO Global Programme on AIDS \nshowed little difference in levels of risk behavior among young people in rural and urban areas \nin PNG and elsewhere;7 and (iii) most people living with HIV/AIDS are in the rural areas. \n  \n19.  Social marketing is a very culturally sensitive, consumer-oriented enterprise. Repeated \nsurveys  and  other  forms  of  research,  including  in-depth  qualitative  research  and  size \nestimations of at-risk groups, are needed to understand the potential consumers\u2019 beliefs and \npreferences in detail and coverage needs. Advertising can include but not be dependent on \nmass  media.  Events  can  be  staged,  theatrical  methods  used,  multiple  face-to-face \ncommunication methods through teams of communicators, mobile video units, boats on rivers or \nother waterways, outdoor media, cartoons, clothing, and other printed media are the more \ncommon modes of advertising. Many more can be invented as needed. \n \n20.  Monthly  marketing  statistics  must  also  be  retrieved  from  a  country-wide  monitoring \nsystem. A wide variety of distribution points, both traditional (wholesalers, pharmacies, food \nstores, hotel shops) and nontraditional (guest houses, small kiosks, night clubs, bars, markets) \nare required for success. Many thousands of such distribution points will be required. Setting up \nsuch a distribution system requires considerable expertise in management and large national \nand  local  teams.  Internal  social  marketing  within  high-risk  group  interventions  is  also  an \nexcellent method of distribution, with sex workers selling to other sex workers or clients in the \ncontext of targeted outreach programs. Such programs often have drop-in centers, dedicated \nclinics and other services that attract persons who are selling sex, permit the development of a \nsense of solidarity, and promote norm change. Similar targeted programs for youth or men who \nhave sex with men are also included within the range of market sub-segments in large social \nmarketing programs.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Brown, L., K.

It is suggested that funds be secured on the order of $2 million\u2013$3 million per year \nfor 4 years, in the first instance, in order to make such a contract attractive to an internationally \nreputable company.  \n \n22.  The strategies of social marketing companies differ as do their levels of success. For \nfruitful HIV investment, it is important to hold a company accountable for assuring that its \ncondoms are reaching the most at-risk people, as each sexual act covered by condoms among \npeople with a large number of multiple partners (about 15% of the population), has the greatest \nimpact on the epidemic. Therefore, while the number of condoms sold is a valuable indicator, \nother indicators are also required.  \n \n23.  The monitoring of behavior change related to condom use requires excellent sampling \nas small changes may not be significant and one can only be certain there is success (or failure) \nbased on the production of sound 90% or 95% confidence intervals. Obtaining these means \nevery person interviewed in a survey must have an equal chance of being selected as every \nother person. If registration of selected sections of the population is needed for this, as is done \nfor the demographic and health surveys, then it is done for social marketing as well.  \n \n24.  Fairly large numbers of local persons are usually hired, trained and supervised as local \nteams for these activities. Sales teams are also hired, trained and supervised by geographical \narea. Therefore, funds for local staff on various levels must be nearly equal to that of expatriate \nstaff. \n \n25.  Those companies that bid will describe their methods and should demonstrate their prior \nsuccess rates using those methods. The terms of reference must not set out a detailed list of \nactivities, but those who will be reading these bids should have prior experience with large \nsocial marketing investments. Much depends upon the skills and knowledge of the person \nselected as country director, and the TOR should specify that CVs of potential country directors \nare submitted for comment or even that candidates visit the country. Even very well-known and \nusually successful companies have poor programs if the wrong person is placed in-country. \n \n26.  Social marketing companies soon become a major part of the national response to HIV \nin all countries where their methods are sound and successful. They sit on the CCMs in most of \nAsia and Africa and take part in national strategic planning and other discussions involving all \nthe stakeholders.  \n \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nIMPROVING HIV SURVEILLANCE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA \n \n1.  In  1998,  UNAIDS  and  others  revamped  the  classification  of  HIV  epidemics  and \nrecommended  surveillance  methods.  The  resulting  format  was  called  \u201csecond-generation \nsurveillance\u201d  and  included  behavioral  surveillance  as  well  as  markers  of  other  sexually \ntransmitted diseases in addition to HIV.1 In 2004 another meeting was held to review more \nrecent experiences and new techniques for surveillance, and to discuss their strengths and \nweaknesses.2 For PNG, where surveillance has not been rationalized in relation to its epidemic, \nthe opportunity exists to update the methodology and develop skills in-country, which will enable \nPNG to collect the data needed to guide and develop prevention programs intelligently.  \n \n2.  Surveillance worldwide has had a large impact by keeping the epidemic in the spotlight. \nImproving  surveillance  in  PNG  will  enable  better  formulation  of  policy,  improved  national \nestimates, more rational advocacy, guidance for programs on prevention and care, identification \nof research questions, delineation of marginalized groups, and the use of these data for broader \nmonitoring and evaluation purposes. The purpose of surveillance is to enable an effective public \nhealth response to the HIV epidemic, and all populations under surveillance must be offered \neffective prevention and care programs. Surveillance must combine behavioral data on the \nsame groups and catchment areas in which HIV sero-sampling takes place. Recently, linked \nbehavioral  and  serological  data  have  proved  acceptable  to  collect  (without  individual \nidentification) among youth, antenatal mothers, and other groups. An increasing number of \nnational household surveys have been carried out as well. Some surveys have had high levels \nof refusals, but others have not. \n \n3.  Over  the  past  decade,  PNG\u2019s  surveillance  has  depended  largely  on  the  passive \ncollection of samples, often unreported or very tardily reported in the national figures. More \nrecently a lapsed attempt at sentinel surveillance has been revived with the annual collection of \nblood samples at several urban, hospital-based antenatal clinics (ANCs). ANC data are not, \nhowever, as representative as often implied. ANC data are inadequately adjusted for age, male-\nfemale ratios, and rural vs. urban prevalence differences. In some countries, the average ANC \nprevalence levels are close to those found in national household surveys. However, in PNG only \n40% of all HIV samples have ages recorded and approximately 60% of pregnant women never \nattend a clinic. Under these conditions, it is likely that the difference between actual national \nprevalence and urban ANC prevalence will differ. Recent experience shows that, where most \nnational  surveys  are  carried  out,  they  show  that  the  epidemic  is  not  as  generalized  as \nestimated. \n \n4.  These findings have important implications for the allocation of resources. While there \nare data to show that some rural areas along main roads, for example in the Asaro Valley of \nEastern  Highlands  in  PNG,  have  very  high  levels  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs) \namong women, other community-level studies in other rural areas (e.g., Hawain area of East \nSepik Province) do not exhibit as high STI levels. No surveillance among the most at-risk \ngroups such as sex workers or their clients has begun. Targeting resources where they will \nhave the most impact requires adequate data. PNG does not have adequate data on HIV/STI \nprevalence or risk behaviors among urban youth; urban or rural sex workers; or documented \nclient groups such as government workers, police, security men, miners, or loggers.

PNG has not yet been able to conduct the targeted interventions with high-risk people \nthat would provide venues through which sentinel surveillance could be achieved. This must be \ndeveloped as soon as possible. For the next several years, however, reliance on ANC and \nsexually  transmitted  disease  clinic  data  will  be  insufficient  to  estimate  with  accuracy  the \ndistribution and rates of infection throughout the country. A national survey, attached to a much \nneeded Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), is required at this time. PNG is greatly in need \nof characterizing its epidemic accurately. \n \n6.  The principal limiting factor, however, is capacity to plan surveillance systems, collect \ndata, use data, advocate with data, and to design and implement effective, targeted behavior \nchange programs for the people the data reveal need them. To build that capacity, long-term \ntechnical assistance by highly competent persons in serological and behavioral epidemiology is \nneeded.  Experience  in  other  countries  (e.g.,  Bangladesh)  has  demonstrated  that  a  well-\nconducted annual surveillance can be implemented and institutionalized in 2\u20133 years. A person \nwith advanced skills will be needed to consolidate and analyze all the collected data for many \nyears to come, but there are ways to train such persons over time. Several Papuan New \nGuineans with backgrounds in social science and epidemiology should be selected to learn all \nthe skills needed to carry out surveillance and, ideally, their institutions should maintain their \nposts into the future. \n \n7.  A recent DHS+ in Cameroon revealed that levels of HIV were twice as high among \neducated than uneducated women and men, a finding that may be counter-intuitive to some \nobservers. In South Africa, HIV surveillance among youth showed 60% of those saying they had \nno  risk  of HIV  were  already  infected.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority in   \npriority in country poverty analysis?     country poverty partnership agreement?   Yes \n   No   \n \nNo \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Papua New Guinea: \n \nPoverty in PNG is perceived to have dramatically increased in recent years. Although most of the poor live in rural \nareas, urban poverty has worsened because of growing rural\u2013to-urban migration, which, in turn, was prompted by the \npoor delivery of basic social services and rising unemployment of school leavers in rural areas. The principal \nchallenges for poverty reduction in PNG are the restoration of economic growth and the continued provision of basic \nservices. These are in line with the priorities of the poor identified during the participatory assessment of hardship in \n2001: access to jobs and income opportunities as well as improved service delivery and infrastructure.  \n \nOver 30% of the population live in poverty, and government capacity to provide basic services is under great strain. \nEconomic and social infrastructure is in disrepair, particularly for rural residents, denying them access to basic social \nand economic services. The national and provincial governments cannot meet the requirements of primary health \ncare and other services, and the provincial system is being reformed to address this problem of service delivery. This \nhas left the burden of rural health service provision largely to the churches, with limited but regular funding from \ngovernment.  Increasing  unemployment  and  the  stark  absence  of  economic  opportunities  contribute  to  urban \nmigration, squatter communities, and high levels of crime.  \n \nAccess to basic social services is poor. Health service is declining at all levels of delivery, as is basic service \ninfrastructure, particularly health aid posts. Disease control is inadequate, with low immunization coverage, increasing \nnumbers of tuberculosis patients, and increasing HIV prevalence estimated at 1.6% among the 15\u201349 age group. The \nHIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow unabated, with prevalence estimated at up to 4% in urban areas, and 1% in \nrural areas. The response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic has thus far been weak and ineffective, and unless the spread is \ncontrolled, economic growth and the fight against poverty will suffer.  \n \nAfter steadily improving in the 1980s, people\u2019s health has deteriorated overall since the 1990s mainly because the \nhealth system, especially in rural areas and at the district level, is dysfunctional. A 2001 review found rural health \nservices to be in a state of \u201cslow breakdown and collapse\u201d.1 Hundreds of rural health facilities are either closed or not \nfully functioning. District health services are equally poor, with health centers shut down or delivering extremely \nlimited services at best. District health facilities face extensive problems: low capacities of health staff, limited training, \na lack of supervision and support, inadequate equipment and supplies, and insufficient financial resources. \n \nThe Project will help strengthen government leadership and implement strategies to contain the spread of HIV among \nrural populations. The Project will extend support for a government leadership role to establish public-private \npartnerships with rural development enclaves focused on improving and extending health services to surrounding \ncommunities. The Project will develop local civil society organizations\u2019 competency to work directly with affected \ncommunities to address issues related to the epidemic. A national surveillance system covering all provinces will be \nestablished, and home-based care mechanisms as well as a condom social marketing program developed. By 2015, \nthe Project will have helped PNG control and by 2020 stabilize the spread of HIV/AIDS. Support of the health sector \nand the increasingly organized fight against HIV/AIDS are integral to the strategy to strengthen the delivery of basic \nservices, especially to the rural poor.  \n \nAchieving PNG\u2019s Medium-Term Development Strategy goal for controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS will require \nincreased and sustained public investment in education and health. Levels of social indicators remain extremely poor, \nespecially for women. Low life expectancy, high infant mortality, poor adult literacy, and low enrolment at all levels of \neducation combine with low per capita income to make PNG\u2019s human development level the lowest of ADB\u2019s Pacific \nmember countries. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  World Health Organization. 2004.

Poverty Analysis          Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nSocioeconomic conditions in PNG place its people in a vulnerable state and pose challenges to the government in \nmeeting its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. On a global scale, PNG ranks in the lowest one third \nof all nations, and lowest among its Pacific neighbors, on the human development index2. The country has a high \nfertility rate (4.8%) and a young population, with 42.0% under the age of 15. The infant mortality rate (82/1,000 live \nbirths) and maternal mortality rate are among the highest in the world. Literacy is also very low, with only around 25% \nof the population functionally literate (footnote 2).   Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The generally low \nstatus of women and the special health risk they face, as well as sexual violence, places them at a higher risk of HIV \ninfection. \n \nAn estimated 40% of the population now lives on less than $1 a day, up from 25% in 1996.3 Prospects for formal \nemployment are minimal, and it has risen by only 1.5% since 1996. The complex land tenure system and the low \nprospects for land reform offer few alternatives in the informal sector. Rising poverty is linked to high levels of crime \nand violence. General development continues to be hampered by the poor nationwide peace-and-order situation. The \nhighlands remain unstable, and security in urban areas appears to have worsened. In response, the Government has \nproduced a national poverty reduction strategy, which has been used in the formulation of the Government\u2019s Medium-\nTerm Development Strategy (MTDS), which has a strong poverty focus.  \n \nIndicators for the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) between 1990 and present demonstrate \nmixed results. Poverty has not been reduced over the past 10 years, and the national target for reduction between \n1996 (baseline year) and 2015 is a modest 3% instead of the MDG target of 50%. The HIV prevalence rates in \npregnant women and the general adult population have been growing at a considerable pace since HIV/AIDS was \nfirst discovered in PNG and show no signs of slowing down. The figure of infants with low birth weight from 1998-\n2003 was 11% of all births, and 35% of children under 5 were reportedly moderately or severely underweight in 1995-\n2003.4 \n \nCommunicable diseases are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in PNG, and they account for approximately \n50% of the country\u2019s mortality.5 The leading diseases have been pneumonia, hepatitis, malaria, diarrheal diseases, \ntuberculosis, and meningitis. Malaria and pneumonia combined account for one-third of all recorded deaths (footnote \n5)  However, HIV/AIDS is also one of the leading causes of hospitalization (and subsequently deaths), accounting for \n60% of bed occupancy at Port Moresby General Hospital. \n \nSocioeconomic realities, behaviors molded by cultural and sexual practices, and the gender dimensions of the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic in PNG present ideal conditions for the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted \ninfections (STIs). This is already evident with the exponential growth of the epidemic over the last 15 years. All \nsectors of society need to work together by taking positive steps in addressing the epidemic in the next 5\u201310 years.  \n \nThe goal of the grant is to assist the Government in its fight against HIV/AIDS and its effort to meet the MTDS target \nfor HIV/AIDS control. The grant will help the Government take the fight against HIV/AIDS to the rural population \nsurrounding development enclave sites. Many of PNG's economic sectors typically comprise discreet rural enclaves \nwhich generate local employment and a cash economy in stark contrast to surrounding populations which rely on \nsubsistence farming. These development enclaves foster the exchange of goods and cash for sex among the \nperipheral populations. High-risk sex behavior is characteristically associated with the surrounding populations of \nrural enclave development sites. \n \nThe poverty analysis will help ensure that the investments proportionally benefit the poor and disadvantaged. The \nProject reduces vulnerability risks of the poor and disadvantaged from becoming further marginalized. The analysis \nshould  also  include  a  needs  assessment  that  identifies  (i)  the  existing  burden  of  disease  of  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged groups, (ii) possible strategies to optimize their use of services, and (iii) the current capacity of the \nhealth system to effectively address their health needs. The analysis should also examine partnership arrangements \nto enhance the sustainability of the regional delivery of basic health services. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 UNDP. 2004.

Yes   No  \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and the \nways in which they affect or complement project feasibility and success. The Project design also linked with the \nmechanisms used for the Global Fund, which released the first tranche for HIV/AIDS in August 2005. ADB was \nrecently included as a member of the Global Fund Country Consultative Mechanism (CCM). Primary institutional \nstakeholders include the National Department of Health, the National AIDS Council, the Special Parliamentary \nCommittee on HIV/AIDS Advocacy, churches, NGOs, private sector, and business associations involved in fighting \nHIV/AIDS. Other institutional stakeholders are the various development partners, such as AusAID, New Zealand AID, \nUNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, and World Health Organization. Primary non-institutional stakeholders include the \npoor, children, other vulnerable groups, and sex workers and their clients. The preparation of the Project involved an \nanalysis of the community-based organizations involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and care, and the establishment of \nlinkages with these organizations to ensure comprehensive community programs. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \nA participation strategy is integrated into the overall project design. The Project entails various types of formal \npartnerships  to  ensure  widespread  participation.  Several  partnership  agreements  will  be  signed  between  the \nGovernment and participating development enclave operators for primary health care and HIV/AIDS prevention and \ncare. There will also be a formal agreement among the development partners for pooling funds for the social \nmarketing of condoms. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nThe Project will deal with these issues directly as part of the enclave-oriented design. First, an assessment will be \nmade to understand how women in the workplace, as well as those in settlements (in-migrants) and the surrounding \nvillages are affected by the HIV epidemic. Second, specific activities will be developed to work with the economic \noperators, families, men, and women to reduce the differential impact on women and girls. The behavioral change \nstrategies in the communities and in peer groups (e.g., sex workers) will benefit women and reduce their exposure to \nHIV by reducing high-risk behavior among women and their male partners. Promoting condom use and making \ncondoms available in rural areas will further protect women from the risk of HIV. The Project will provide women with \nSTI treatment. Greater accessibility to STI treatment and drugs is an important aspect in HIV prevention. Men \nemployed in the development enclaves are normally provided access to health services from the operator\u2019s clinic, but \ntheir family members are not always included. By expanding the private operators\u2019 health services to more people in \nthe community and rehabilitating nonoperational public health clinics in rural areas, far more women will receive \nprimary health care, STI treatment, and HIV care. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nPNG is a diverse nation with many different cultures, languages, traditions, and sexual practices that expose women \ndifferentially to the risk of HIV infection. In many cultures, women form an underclass, with reduced access to food, \ncash, and other resources. Women\u2019s representation at all levels of the economy and Government is limited. The \nchurches have played a significant role in social change, reaching the remotest rural areas and providing almost 50% \nof health and educational services, but they usually encourage male dominance as a Christian value. Levels of \ndomestic and sexual violence are high, with few services to address the needs of affected women. \n \nWhile almost equal numbers of men and women are reported to have HIV in PNG, women are increasingly infected \nat a younger age. Women are disadvantaged by greater levels of illiteracy and lack of access to cash incomes. \nBecause of the difficulties of economic survival, many women trade sex for money or other goods. In some \ncircumstances, sexual transactions are brokered by male relatives, in traditional fashion, although more organized \nAsian-style prostitution has begun to be seen.  \n \nIn rural areas, some women walk many hours to reach a government center where men with paychecks may pay for \nsex, in order to purchase used clothes for their children or pay school fees. Rural poverty in many areas is extreme \nand drives many women to migrate into cities or settle near economic enclaves. Sex workers are stigmatized and \ntheir social capital is reduced with families and communities. When these women develop AIDS, they are often \nabandoned by their families. Many other women are faithful wives but acquire infections from unfaithful husbands, yet \nit is they who are shut out from family support. In some cases, these women have been burned, neglected, and killed. \nIn Port Moresby, their children are abandoned at the hospital in increasingly large numbers. Catholic and a few other \nfaith-based agencies are working to reduce this impact at the village level, but their services only reach a small \nproportion of those in need. Although a national media campaign tries to reduce the stigma associated with \nHIV/AIDS, it has little impact, particularly in rural areas.  ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nHas an output been prepared?
