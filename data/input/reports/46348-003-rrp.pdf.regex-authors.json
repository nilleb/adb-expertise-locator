I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed grant, and (iii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the \nEurasian Development Bank (EDB), all to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Toktogul Rehabilitation \nPhase 2 Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will (i) continue the phased rehabilitation of Toktogul hydroelectric power \nplant (HPP) by replacing two of the four existing generator and turbine units and associated \nauxiliary  equipment;  (ii)  prepare  an  asset  inventory  and  revaluation  for  the  seven  power \ncompanies,2 and Bishkekteploset (heat and hot water distribution company); (iii) prepare a \npower sector master plan to include a due diligence study for the rehabilitation of Uch Kurgan \nHPP; and (iv) implement a business process improvement project for the main generation \ncompany, Open Joint-Stock Company Electric Power Plants (EPP). The project will increase \ndomestic energy supply and international electricity trade, improve asset management and \nsector planning, and strengthen sector operational performance.3 The project complements \nongoing sector developments in asset rehabilitation, system loss reduction, tariff policy, and \nsector governance. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic power sector is characterized by ageing assets, high commercial \nlosses, below-cost tariffs, and poor performance of sector companies. Power sector assets are \nover 30 years old and approaching the end of their economic life. This results in reduced \nreliability and high system technical losses (15% of net supply).  The sector also suffers from \nhigh commercial losses (15% of net supply), poor financial management and performance, and \ntariffs that are below cost recovery. Following exceptionally high growth in domestic demand \n(50% from 2009 to 2013), there is a critical need for major rehabilitation, replacement, and \naugmentation of sector assets. \n \n4.  The government has identified development of the energy sector as a major component \nof  its  development  plan. 4  The  government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  (i)  improve  sector  financial \nperformance  and  corporate  management,  (ii)  increase  energy  security  by  development  of \ndomestic resources, (iii) expand regional power exports, and (iv) phase in cost-recovery tariffs \nby 2017.  \n \n5.  Over $5 billion of investment in the generation and transmission subsectors is planned in \n2014\u20132024, including $4 billion of proposed commercial export-oriented HPPs to be developed \nby the private sector. While the private sector projects are under active development, financing \nis not confirmed. The project focuses on the immediate priority of ensuring domestic supply. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The power sector consists of two generation companies, EPP and Chakan GES; one electrical-grid transmission \ncompany, National Electrical Grid of Kyrgyzstan; and four regional electricity distribution companies: Vostokelectro \n(eastern  region),  Oshelectro  (Osh  and  Batken  regions),  Jalalabatelectro  (southern  Jalalabat  region),  and \nSeverelectro (Bishkek, Chuy, and Talas regions). \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Toktogul \nRehabilitation Project Phase 2 (TA 8434-KGZ). \n4  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013. The Kyrgyz Republic Sustainable Development Program, 2013\u20132017. \nBishkek.  Approved by Government Resolution No. 3694-V on 18 December 2013.  \n \n ", "2 \n \n6.  EPP, the owner and operator of Toktogul HPP, wishes to implement the complete \nrehabilitation of the Toktogul HPP.  Toktogul HPP is the country\u2019s largest and most important \npower plant, with installed capacity of 1,200 MW. It produces 40% of the country\u2019s average \nelectricity output, and is critical both as a domestic power source and for power export; it also \nprovides frequency regulator services to the Central Asian power system. Toktogul HPP was \nplaced into service in 1975, and has undergone no significant rehabilitation. Critical equipment \ncomponents  are  failing,  resulting  in  availability  dropping  to  80%;  a  continued  decline  in \navailability is expected in the absence of rehabilitation. An assessment concluded that all the \nHPPs on the Naryn Cascade require rehabilitation; rehabilitation of Toktogul HPP was identified \nas the highest priority.5 Failure of Toktogul HPP would affect the stability of the Central Asian \npower system and be catastrophic for the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s electricity supply. \n   \n7.  The complete rehabilitation of Toktogul HPP is planned over a three-phase program. \nThe first ongoing phase under ADB financing covers replacement of secondary electrical and \nmechanical  equipment,  which  was  identified  as  the  top  priority. 6 The  proposed  project \nconstitutes the second phase, and will rehabilitate two of the four turbine and generator units. \nThe proposed project is included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country operations \nbusiness plan for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2014\u22122016.7 The third phase will rehabilitate the two \nremaining turbine and generator units and will carry out repairs to civil structures as may be \nidentified by an ongoing dam safety assessment study being financed by ADB. Each phase is a \nstandalone project that is independent of each other. The three-phase program is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n8.  Ongoing ADB and donor projects are assisting the government in addressing (i) loss \nreduction by establishment of an independent electricity settlement center and installation of \nwholesale  and  retail  meters;  (ii)  policy  reform  through  establishment  of  an  independent \nregulator, introduction of a cost-recovery tariff, and implementation of an information program to \ninform the public of the need for tariff increases; (iii) sector-wide asset rehabilitation; and (iv) \ncommercial strengthening of sector companies through improved governance and business \nprocesses.  \n \n9.  Additional  sector  issues  to  be  addressed  to  ensure  sector  viability  include  (i)  poor \noperational performance of EPP because of deficient governance and management procedures \nand practices, and inadequate business systems; (ii) absence of an up-to-date power sector \nmaster plan leading to sub-optimal sector development; (iii) weak asset inventory and valuation, \nwhich inhibits financial control; and (iv) preparation for the rehabilitation of the 180 MW Uch \nKurgan HPP, the next priority project after Toktogul. \n \n10.  Tariffs  are  below  cost  recovery,  with  a  2013  weighted  average  consumer  tariff  of \nSom0.92 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The government will implement a phased tariff increase in \naccordance with its medium-term tariff plan, which will increase the weighted average tariff in \n2017 to Som1.43/kWh.8 The government is empowered to implement such a tariff increase \nfollowing decisions by the Parliament (in June 2014) and by the President (in July 2014) to \ntransfer tariff approval authority from Parliament to the government. In July 2014, Parliament \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Power Sector Rehabilitation Project.

A purchasing power parity assumption has been \nadopted for exchange rate adjustment. \nd  Interest during construction has been computed following the appropriate interest rates for Asian Development Bank \nand Eurasian Development Bank loans. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR43,680,000  and  a  grant  not  exceeding  $44,500,000,  both  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \n \n ", "4 \n \nannum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in the draft financing and \nproject agreements.  \n \n15.  The government has also requested a loan of $100,000,000 from the EDB Anti-Crisis \nFund. The EDB loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \nrate of 1% per annum and an up-front fee of 0.50%. The EDB loan will be partially administered \nby  ADB,  including  procurement  review  and  disbursement  supervision.  The  EDB  loan  will \nexclusively finance the turnkey contract for the rehabilitation of generator and turbine units 2 \nand 4 of Toktogul HPP. \n \n16.  The government will allocate grant funds including a contingency allocation of 20% to (i) \nthe Ministry of Energy and Industry (MOEI) for the  master plan component and individual \nconsultants to assist its project implementation unit (PIU), and (ii) the State Property Fund (SPF) \nfor  the  asset  revaluation  component  and  individual  consultants  to  assist  its  PIU.  The \ngovernment will transfer the remaining amount to EPP for the turnkey rehabilitation contracts, \nconsulting services for project implementation, and external audits; the transfer will take the \nform of 50% by equity contribution and 50% by relending. The equity and loan components will \nbe progressively disbursed to EPP based on amounts disbursed under the ADB loan and grant, \nand EDB loan. The relending to EPP will be for a 25-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and an interest rate of 1.5% per annum. EPP will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n17.  The financing plan is in Table 2. ADB loan and grant funds and EDB funds will finance \nthe rehabilitation of Toktogul units 2 and 4 and the repair of the hydraulic steel structures.

EPP  is  responsible for  implementation  of Toktogul  HPP rehabilitation  and  the  EPP \nbusiness improvement process project components. EPP will establish a dedicated full-time PIU \nto oversee execution of the consulting and construction contracts. The PIU will be supported by \nindividual national consultants from 2015 to 2017. The PIU will be assisted by an international \nengineering  consulting  firm  for  Toktogul  HPP  rehabilitation  whose  services  will  include \npreparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation, construction supervision, project accounting, \nsafeguard monitoring, and reporting to the government and ADB. The PIU will also be assisted \nby an international ERP consulting firm whose services will include assessment of existing \nbusiness procedures, identification of project requirements, preparation of ERP bid documents, \nbid evaluation, and project supervision. \n \n20.

Accordingly,  universal \n \n ", "6 \n \nprocurement will apply to all procurement and consulting services packages to be financed \nunder the project.10 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  An international consulting firm, recruited under ADB-financed technical assistance (TA), \nconducted due diligence of the rehabilitation of Toktogul HPP. The TA concluded that the entire \nplant\u2019s  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment  needed  to  be  replaced.  Considering  funding \nconstraints, a phased rehabilitation was recommended, with the first phase to cover priority \nauxiliary equipment, and the second and third phases to be done on a turbine and generator \nunit basis. The ongoing Power Sector Rehabilitation Project covers priority common electrical \nequipment. ADB-financed TA for preparation of this project recruited the same international \nconsultant to conduct due diligence for phase 2. The TA identified rehabilitation of turbine and \ngenerator units 2 and 4 as the next priority, with the final third phase to cover replacement of \nturbine and generator units 1 and 3. \n \n23.  The project will replace turbine and generator units 2 and 4 and all associated auxiliary \nand control equipment and repair the existing hydraulic steel structures. The project benefits will \ninclude (i) increasing unit power output from the existing 300 MW to 360 MW, (ii) increasing unit \nefficiency by 2.5 percentage points from 90.0% to 92.5%, and (iii) improving availability from \n80% to 95%. Life expectancy of the rehabilitated units will be 35 years. \n \n24.  Suitable replacement equipment is available in the international market, uses proven \ntechnology, and is appropriate for Toktogul site conditions. The consultant will prepare technical \nspecifications  in  accordance  with  industry  practice  for  turnkey  contracts  to  (i)  design, \nmanufacture, install, and commission the new turbine and generator units; and (ii) perform \nrepairs of the hydraulic steel structures. Firms qualified to perform the turnkey contract are \navailable in the international market. Training of EPP staff on operation and maintenance will be \nprovided by the turnkey contractor. \n \n25.  The climate change impact on the hydrology of the Syr Darya river basin, which supplies \nToktogul  reservoir,  has  been  assessed  under  separate  TA.11 A  hydrology  specialist  was \nrecruited  to  assess  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  the  project  and  to  assess  reservoir \nsedimentation. The specialist\u2019s report supports the Toktogul HPP rehabilitation and states that \n(i) the reservoir and dam spillways can safely cater for water inflows that will first increase (due \nto melting of glaciers) and then decrease, (ii) average energy production will decrease by 11% \nover the next 40 years (0.25% per year), and (iii) sediment transport has not significantly \ndecreased the volume of the reservoir.  \n \n26.  To ensure complementarity of the project with the ongoing first phase of the Power \nSector Rehabilitation Project (footnote 7), under which the turnkey contract  rebidding is in \nprogress, the scope of the first phase has been adjusted by (i) adding an underwater survey of \nthe hydraulic steel structures, to allow specification of the work to be done under the project; \nand (ii) removing the generator and turbine control systems, which are better associated with \nthe provision of the turbine and generator units in the project. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013.

The economic internal rate of return is calculated at 19.16%, which compares favorably \nwith the 12% opportunity cost of capital. The project\u2019s economic viability takes into account \ncost\u2013benefit streams resulting from rehabilitation of Toktogul HPP and operation over the life of \nthe project. The incremental benefits come from avoided outages and major incidents and \nassociated  repair  costs,  and  reduced  energy  imports.  Regional  economic  benefits  are  not \nincluded in the economic internal rate of return calculations because they accrue to countries \nother than the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n28.  The financial internal rate of return is calculated at 9.1%, which compares favorably with \nthe weighted average cost of capital of 4.8%. Financial viability was gauged by comparing the \nrevenue  and  cost  streams  of  \u201cwith-project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenarios.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis indicates the project\u2019s economic and financial viability is robust even under unfavorable \ncircumstances. \n \n29.  EPP\u2019s  financial  situation  is  critical.  Its  average  tariff  (Som0.28/kWh  in  2014)  is \ninsufficient to cover costs. Equity is forecast to be depleted by 2016. To ensure that EPP will be \nfinancially  sustainable  and  in  a  position  to  meet  its  financial  covenants  by  2019,12 the \ngovernment will (i) transfer ADB and EDB loan and grant funds to EPP through 50% equity \ncontribution and 50% relending, (ii) waive taxes and duties on project-related expenditures, and \n(iii) provide at least 60% of incremental heat and electricity sector revenues resulting from \nimplementation of the Medium-Term Tariff Policy as additional EPP revenues. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  A financial management assessment, which includes a risk management assessment, \nwas  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  While  the  country\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement capacity is weak, EPP is an autonomous corporate enterprise with strong financial \nmanagement, accounting, and reporting systems. EPP has been implementing the first phase of \nthe Toktogul HPP rehabilitation since 2012 and has submitted an external audit report for the \nproject financial statements on time with no material qualifications. Consequently, the financial \nmanagement  arrangements  now  in  place  for  the  Power  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project  are \nconsidered acceptable for the project. The assessment found that internal control could be \nstrengthened and adherence to accounting standards and disclosure improved. A procurement \ncapacity assessment was also conducted and found that procedures are not followed and \ncapacity is weak. In order to improve corporate performance, improvements must be made to (i) \nfinancial management capabilities, internal control and auditing, and procurement capacity and \nprocedures. This will be addressed under the EPP business process improvement project. \n \n31.  To  ensure  good  governance  in  project-related  activities,  the  project  will  include \nmeasures to: \n \n(i)  strengthen the existing PIU and maintain separate project accounts by EPP; \n(ii)  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  to  provide  assistance  in  project \nimplementation; \n(iii)  establish  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants; and \n                                                \n12 Debt\u2013service coverage ratio not less than 1 (by 2017) and 1.3 (by 2019), debt\u2013equity ratio (debt as a percentage of \nthe sum of debt and equity) not more than 75% (by 2017) and 70% (by 2019), current ratio of at least 1, and self-\nfinancing ratio of at least 20% (by 2019). \n \n ", "8 \n \n(iv)  ensure the project accounts of each agency and corporate accounts of EPP are \naudited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB, in accordance \nwith international standards. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  EPP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  The general population will benefit from a transparent, accountable, and efficient power \nsector. During power cuts, the poor are disproportionally affected as they must rely on more \nexpensive (non-electric) energy sources. \n \n34.  The project will not impact affordability or operational employment opportunities. During \nconstruction, the turnkey contractor will be required to ensure equal opportunities for all social \ngroups, equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, and prohibition of child labor. The \ncontractor will also be required to undertake HIV/AIDS awareness activities with construction \nworkers. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  Environmental assessment.  The project is classified as environmental category B \naccording to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  was  prepared  and  public \nconsultation was carried out. The IEE has been endorsed by EPP and disclosed in mid-August \n2014 on the EPP website. ADB has advised its no objection and posted the IEE on its website \non  8  August  2014. The  IEE  will  be  updated by  the  PIU  with  assistance from the  project \nimplementation consultant based on detailed design by the turnkey contractor. A copy of the \nState Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry approval of the IEE will be sent to ADB \nduring project detailed design. \n \n36.  The main environmental impacts of the project include (i) occupational and health and \nsafety at the project site; (ii) management of the waste oil and grease; (iii) disposal of scrap \nmetal  and  other  solid  waste;  and  (iv)  transportation  of  construction  materials  and  heavy \nequipment to the project site, as well as generated waste out of the project site. The EMP \nspecifies adequate mitigation measures and monitoring plans to cover these impacts. Released \noil and scrap metal will be safely kept at the onsite storage area, improvement for which will be \nfinanced by the phase 1 loan, for use throughout all phases of the Toktogul rehabilitation \nprogram. EPP is responsible for recycling and disposing of oil and scrap metal, which will be \nperformed  by  licensed  companies  under  the  monitoring  and  supervision  of  the  project \nimplementation consultant (PIC) and PIU. \n \n37.  The PIU will be responsible for EMP implementation with assistance from the project \nimplementation consultant and staff of the EPP Service of Reliability and Safety department. An \nenvironmental and hazardous waste management specialist will be hired upon commencement \nof the construction contract to work for 3 years in the PIU to build EPP\u2019s in-house capacity. \nEnvironmental monitoring will be performed by the PIC. Monitoring results will be included in the \nproject quarterly progress reports and semi-annual environmental reports. \n \n38.  The costs of EMP mitigation measures will be included in the turnkey contract, and the \ncost  of  environmental  monitoring  will  be  included  in  the  project  implementation  consultant \n ", "9 \n \ncontract. EPP costs for disposal of waste material will be covered by revenue from the sale of \nwaste material. \n \n39.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project investment will be implemented in the existing \nToktogul HPP, and land acquisition and resettlement impacts are not envisaged. The site where \nthe project is to be implemented has been in operation for 45 years. There are no outstanding \nsafeguard issues. The possible transport routes for equipment and machines were also found to \nhave no safeguard issues. The project is not expected to affect indigenous peoples as defined \nunder ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements for indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n40.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 The overall assessment is that risks have \nbeen identified and mitigated and that the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak financial  The government is implementing an action plan to reform the public \nmanagement, internal  financial management system. \ncontrol, and risk  MOEI has mandated creation of an internal audit department in EPP. \nmanagement. \nExternal audits will be required to meet international standards. \nSpecialist support will be provided to the project implementation unit. \nDirect payment procedures will be used for consultants and contractors. \nEPP governance and business processes will improve as ERP study \nfindings are implemented. \nCentral Asia power  Regional cooperation and trade are supported by the Central Asia \nsystem ceases to operate  Regional Economic Cooperation Program. \nand export markets  Export markets are diversified through the World Bank-developed \ncollapse.
