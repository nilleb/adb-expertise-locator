(NARC) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia).3 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nNingxia, located in the northwest region, is one of the PRC\u2019s ethnic minority regions, with \n3. \na  total  area  of  66,400  square  kilometers  and  a  population  of  6.2  million,  of  which  2.2  million \n(36%) are Hui minority. Ningxia is largely arid and semiarid, with dry and harsh winters and hot \nsummers. \n\n4. \nPoverty.  Ningxia  lags  the  rest  of the  PRC  in terms  of  income  and  well-being.  In  2010, \nNingxia\u2019s per capita gross domestic product was CNY26,860, below the national average gross \ndomestic product of CNY29,762. A large income disparity also exists between urban and rural \nresidents  in  Ningxia,  with  the  average  urban  income  (CNY15,334)  more  than  3  times  that  of \nrural  income  (CNY4,675)  in  2010.  In  2011,  more  than  1  million  people  or  about  25.6%  of  the \nregion\u2019s  rural  population  were  living  below  the  national  poverty  line.4 One  solution  to  reducing \npoverty and the gap between rural and urban income is to improve farming practices and crop \nquality to increase the incomes of crop growers in the agriculture sector. \n\n5. \nHorticultural  development.  Agriculture  remains  an  important  sector  in  Ningxia.  The \nvast plain of the Yellow River in the north has been irrigated for centuries. In the central arid and \nsemiarid  areas  where  the  project  is  located,  extensive  irrigation  infrastructure  has  been  built \nsince the 1960s. Several large lift irrigation schemes were built in the 1980s to divert water from \nthe Yellow River and transformed central Ningxia dryland farm areas into an irrigated agriculture \narea.  Corn  is  the  main  grain  crop  in  the  project  area.  Since  the  late  1990s,  the  Ningxia  Hui \nAutonomous Region government (NHARG) has been promoting the development of horticultural \ncrops to improve land and water productivity, and farmer incomes. Grapes and Chinese dates\u2014\ntwo  of  the  major  horticultural  crops  in  the  project  area\u2014are  promoted  as  priority,  high-value, \nwater-efficient  crops  in  NHARG\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  NHARG  also  has  a  10-\nyear  plan  to  develop  666,670  hectares  (ha)  of  vineyards  by  2020;  NARC,  a  commercialized \nstate-owned enterprise, will play a key role in achieving this target.  \n\n6. \nSince  the  late  1990s,  the  expansion  of  vineyards  in  Ningxia  has  been  rapid  and \nsignificant.  This  was  achieved  largely  using  low  technology  and  poor  vineyard  management \npractices.  Farmers\u2019  on-farm  management  skills  for  grapes  are  low.  This  starts  with  selecting \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n3   The  subproject  locations  are  detailed  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual,  para.  20  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4  The government\u2019s official poverty line in 2011 was CNY2,300 per capita net income per year. \n\n\fvarietals  and  designing  the  layout  of  each  vineyard,  and  extends  to  managing  the  vines  and \ncanopy  and  to  harvesting  practices.  More  training  and  extension  services  are  required  to \nimprove farmers\u2019 skills in vineyard management. \n\nChinese  dates  are  the  key  cash  crop  for  Tongxin  and  Yanchi  counties.  While  local \n7. \nvarieties of  dates  can tolerate  dry  and  low  temperature conditions, the  yield and quality  of the \nexisting  date  orchards  are  mostly  low  because  of  continuous  drought  and  poor  on-farm \nmanagement.  Date  production  will  be  improved  by  providing  reliable  irrigation  and  improved \nfarming  technology  and  management.  High-quality  dates  will  earn  farmers  a  higher  price,  and \nthus higher incomes. \n\n8. \nWater use efficiency. The farming systems in Ningxia\u2019s arid and semiarid areas depend \non  water  availability.  The  project  area  is  characterized  by  low  precipitation,  mostly  late  in  the \ncropping season. Irrigation  is  essential  during  early  crop-growing  stages. Water resources  are \nlimited,  but  flood  irrigation  is  still  practiced  widely  even  for  horticultural  crops,  resulting  in  low \nwater use efficiency. Improvement in water use efficiency by the agriculture sector is paramount \nfor  increasing  agricultural  productivity  and  crop  quality.  New  agricultural  land  can  be \nsubsequently  developed  as  more  water  becomes  available  after  water  is  saved  from  better \nirrigation  efficiency.  Controlled  irrigation  can  also  reduce  water  used  by  crops,  improve  crop \nquality, and reduce soil salinity. \n\n9. \nMarketing  and  business  strategy.  NARC  produces  grapes  through  seven  farms  of  a \nwholly  owned  subsidiary,  Xixia  King  Industrial  Co.  Ltd.,  which  runs  its  wine  business  through \nXixia  King  Winery.  It  is  vital  to  NARC\u2019s  business  profitability  that  the  two  companies  operate \nviable and sustainable vineyard and winery businesses. NARC\u2019s current production model lacks \nadvanced farming technology, resulting in inconsistent quality of grapes, and thus inconsistent \nwine quality. NARC would like to substantially reengineer the production model to improve the \nquality  of  its  products.  To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  new  production  model,  it \nalso needs a new quality system to monitor and review the production performance of its grapes \nand wines. \n\n10. \nAt present, NARC through Xixia King Winery sells about 80% of its wine production and \ncommands  a  70%  market  share  in  wine  sales  in  Ningxia;  it  has  difficulty  entering  the  wine \nmarket  in  other  provinces.  Even  though  wine  consumption  is  increasing  across  the  PRC,  the \nnumber  of  wineries  and  wine  brands  is  also  increasing.  NARC  has  not  yet  identified  proper \nmarketing strategies to improve its competitiveness and profitability. The project will help NARC \nimprove  its  capacity  by  establishing  a  quality  control  system,  developing  a  marketing  and \nbusiness strategy, and providing training and consulting services. \n\n11. \nClimate change impact. Vineyard and orchard production are particularly vulnerable to \nclimate  change.  Temperature  increases,  rainfall  reduction,  change  in  precipitation  pattern  and \nseasonal  duration,  and  higher  incidence  of  extreme  droughts  and  floods  are  affecting  the \nproductivity  of  vineyards  and  orchards  in  Ningxia.  Weather  reports  show  that  (i)  the  average \ntemperature in Ningxia has risen by 0.8\u00b0C since 1960; and (ii) precipitation decreased by about \n8.6% from 1960 to 1990, with a recorded increase in drought events.  More efficient water use is \nrequired to adapt to climate change impacts. \n\n12. \nGovernment  and  ADB  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  Twelfth  Five-Year \nPlan, 2011\u20132015 of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which aims to promote \nequitable  and  balanced  regional  growth,  sustainable  natural  resource  management,  and  crop \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fdiversification. 5  The  project  particularly  follows  the  State  Council\u2019s  decree  on  promoting \neconomic and social development of Ningxia.6 The project supports NHARG\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan  in  accelerating  agricultural  development  by  increasing  agricultural  production  capacity, \nreducing  risk,  and  improving  market  competitiveness.  Both  grapes  and  dates  are  selected  as \nhaving the potential to be transformed into high-value crops. The region\u2019s 10-year development \nplan for viticulture promotes innovation in irrigation technology and advocates the use of water-\nsaving irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler irrigation systems. The project is in line \nwith the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC, \nwhich supports the government\u2019s goal of building a harmonious society by (i) addressing rising \nincome  inequality  and  widening  regional  disparities,  and  (ii)  promoting  environmentally \nsustainable  development. 7  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  for \npromoting integrated water resources management and irrigation efficiency.8  \n\n13. \nLessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  programs  and  projects  of  the \nADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  relating  to  land  and  natural  resource \nmanagement  in  the  PRC.  The  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Facility  Partnership  for  Land \nDegradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems,  which  is  administered  by  ADB,  helped  develop  an \nintegrated  ecosystem  management  strategy  and  action  plan  for  land  management  in  Ningxia, \nwhich the project follows to improve the project design.9 The good practices being implemented \nunder ADB\u2019s ongoing Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural Development Project, such \nas  crop  residue  mulching,  minimum  tillage,  crop  rotation,  improved  pest  and  quality \nmanagement,  and  community  participation,  were  also  considered  in  the  project  design.10 The \nproject  will  use  a  partnership  model  of  enterprise  plus  farmer  household  to  improve  the  value \nchain;  this  was  tested  in  ADB\u2019s  earlier  agriculture  projects. 11  A  project  component  will \nstrengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure \nproject success and sustainability.  \n\n14. \nDemonstration  and  scale-up.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  improvement  of \nirrigation efficiency by using drip irrigation in the project vineyards and date orchards. Irrigation \nefficiency  increase  is  critical  to  the  sustainability  of  Ningxia\u2019s  future  agricultural  development \ngiven  its  limited  water  resources.  The  project  will  help  strengthen  the  partnership  model  of \nenterprises  plus  farmer  households  to  promote  sustainable  farming  practices  and  improve  the \nagricultural  value  chain.  The  results  and  experiences  from  the  project  will  be  replicated  in \nNHARG\u2019s  agricultural  development  programs,  particularly  to  develop  666,670  ha  of  vineyards \nby 2020. \n\n                                                \n5  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2011.

The \n\n15. \noutcome will be increased quality and value of horticultural crops in Ningxia. \n\n16. \nThe project will have four outputs: (i) improved irrigation systems, (ii) improved vineyards \nand  Chinese  date  orchards,  (iii)  increased  grape  processing  capacity,  and  (iv)  strengthened \ninstitutional and farmer capacity. \n\n17. \nOutput 1 will replace the existing irrigation systems with higher efficiency systems on the \nproject  sites,  and  introduce  drip  irrigation  and  hose  irrigation  in  the  project  vineyards  and \nChinese date orchards. It will support the construction of water storage ponds, small pumps, on-\nfarm water distribution pipe networks, and other relevant facilities. \n\n18. \nOutput  2  will  support  (i)  the  rehabilitation  of  1,340  ha  of  existing  vineyards  and  the \nestablishment of 1,260 ha of new vineyards in six farms of Xixia King Industrial Co. Ltd.; (ii) the \nestablishment  of  330  ha  of  vineyards  in  Hongsipu  district;  and  (iii)  the  establishment  and \nrehabilitation of 930 ha of irrigated Chinese date orchards in Tongxin and Yanchi counties.12 It \nwill  also  support  associated  land  leveling;  windbreak  shelterbelts;  improved  farming  practices, \nincluding  pest  management  and  balanced  fertilizer  application,  and  conservation  tillage;  and \naccess roads in the project vineyards and orchards.  \n\n19. \nOutput 3 will support Xixia King Winery in establishing about 15,000 tons of in-situ grape \nprocessing capacity and a quality monitoring system at each of the two NARC farm sites, with \n10,000  tons  at  the  Yuquanying  farm  and  5,000  tons  at  the  Nuanquan  farm.  This  will  include \ngrape crushing, pressing, and juice storage facilities. \n\nOutput  4  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing \n20. \nagencies  to  implement  the  project  and  provide  training  to  farmers  on  the  use  of  drip  irrigation \nand new farming technologies. About 5,000 farmers will be trained on grape and Chinese date \nplanting;  improved  vineyard  and  orchard  technology  and  management;  plant  disease  control \nand  management;  and  other  topics  mostly  through  farmer  field  schools.  It  will  help  NARC  to \nimprove  monitoring  systems  for  quality  control  and  enhance  its  marketing  and  business \nstrategy.  It  will  also  support  development  and  strengthening  of  farmer  associations,  including \nwater users associations; pilot monitoring of water uses by water users associations; monitoring \nservices  including  soil  testing;  and  support  project  management.  About  18  person-months  of \ninternational  and  47  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  the \ntraining  program  and  capacity  development,  including  introduction  of  new  technologies,  and \napplied research and development. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $106.40  million  (Table  1).

The ADB loan will finance $70.00 million, or 65.80% of \nthe  total  project  costs,  including  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  training  and  capacity \ndevelopment, and taxes and duties.15 NARC and the local governments will provide counterpart \nfunds. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nLocal governments of Hongsipu district, and \n    Tongxin and Yanchi countiesa \nNingxia Agricultural Reclamation Group Co., Ltd.  \nTotal \n\n70.00 \n \n9.19 \n27.21 \n106.40 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n65.80 \n \n8.60 \n25.60 \n100.00 \n\na  The Hongsipu district government will finance $2.33 million; the Tongxin county government, $4.82 million; and the \n\nYanchi county government, $2.04 million.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                \n14 The interest includes a maturity premium of 0.1%, which is based on the loan terms and the government\u2019s choice \n\nof repayment option. \n\n15 The amount of taxes and duties to be financed in the project was determined based on the principles that (i) the \ntaxes  and  duties  financed  by  the  ADB  loan,  which  represent  about  1%  of  the  project  cost,  do  not  represent  an \nexcessive share of the project; (ii) the taxes and duties apply only with respect to ADB-financed expenditures; and \n(iii) the financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project since the percentage of \nsome financed expenditures needs to be 100%. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n24. \nNHARG, represented by the Ningxia Finance Department, will be the executing agency \nfor  the  project.  A  project  leading  group,  headed  by  the  vice  chair  of  NHARG,  will  ensure \ncoordination  across  sectors  and  guide  project  preparation  and  implementation.  A  provincial \nproject  management  office  (PPMO)  has  been  established  to  be  responsible  for  daily  project \ncoordination of project preparation and implementation. NARC will be the implementing agency \nfor the activities under its jurisdiction, and the governments of the Hongsipu district, and Tongxin \nand  Yanchi counties  will  be  the  implementing agencies for  subprojects  under their jurisdiction. \nThe implementing agencies will set up project  implementing offices (PIOs) to carry out day-to-\nday  implementation  of  their  subprojects,  procurement,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The \nimplementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 13). \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2018 \nManagement \n\nJuly 2013\u2013June 2018 \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation \n\nunits \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nThe project leading group for foreign debt management of NHARG \nChair: vice chair of NHARG \nMembers: the Ningxia Development and Reform Commission; and the departments \nof agriculture, finance, land management, water resources, and relevant agencies \nNHARG \nNARC  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  activities  in  its  farm \nsites,  including  rehabilitating  and  planting  new  vineyards  with  required  irrigation \ninfrastructure,  establishing  the  two  grape  processing  facilities,  and  undertaking \ntraining and capacity development.  \n\nThe Tongxin and Yanchi county governments will take charge of the establishment of \nChinese date orchards and related irrigation systems, and undertake training and \ncapacity development in their jurisdictions. The Hongsipu district government will \nestablish vineyards and related irrigation systems, and conduct training activities in \nthe district. \nProject implementing offices in NARC and the local governments of Hongsipu district, \nand Tongxin and Yanchi counties.

Retroactive financing will apply to up to 10% of the \ntotal  ADB \nincurred  before  loan \neffectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. \nThe  borrower,  NHARG,  and  the  provincial  project management office  were  advised \nthat approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB \nto finance the project. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between ADB and the government. \n\nto  expenditures \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NARC  =  Ningxia  Agricultural  Reclamation  Group  Co.,  Ltd.,  NHARG  =  Ningxia \nHui Autonomous Region government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n25. \nThe  achievement  of  the  project\u2019s  impact  and  outcome  depends  on  the  successful \nintroduction  and  operation  of  drip  irrigation,  adoption  of  farming  technology,  and  on-farm \nmanagement. The engineering review indicates drip irrigation is relatively new to Ningxia, and a \nspecialized  engineering  firm  needs  to  be  engaged  for  detailed  design,  particularly  to  properly \ndeal with the high silt content in water from the Yellow River. A properly designed system with \nsilt  traps,  reservoirs,  filters,  system  maintenance  and  cleaning,  and  training  on  system \nmaintenance  are  necessary.  The  technical  assessment  suggests  that  farm  management \npractices are critical to the quality of produce. To improve grape quality, monitoring of vine and \nfruit growth through rigorous data collection and recordkeeping of vineyard operations, such as \nirrigation schedules, plant disease prevention measures, and pesticide application, are needed. \nThe  project  has  allocated  budget  for  the  technical  design,  consulting  services,  and  farmer \ntraining in these areas. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nThe economic analysis of the project used with- and without-project scenarios following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.16 The analysis confirms the economic \nviability  of the  project  and  each individual  activity. The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for the \noverall project is estimated at 17.4%, and for individual project activities from 12.1% to 23.8%. \nSensitivity analysis examined the robustness of economic viability of the project and  individual \nactivities  under  three  scenarios:  benefit  decline,  capital  cost  increase,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance cost increase. While the economic viability of the whole project and most activities \nis quite robust, the date monoculture in Yanchi county and vineyard rehabilitation in NARC can \nbe  susceptible  to  a  substantial  benefit  shortfall,  and/or  a  substantial  capital  cost,  and/or \noperation and maintenance cost increase. The financial analysis assessed the financial internal \nrate  of  return  for  the  whole  project  as  15.2%  and  for  the  individual  project  activities  as  9.2%\u2013\n34.7%; all are well above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.77%. Hence, the project and \nthe individual project activities are confirmed financially viable. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nThe institutional and capacity development analysis found that NHARG has experience \nin  implementing  ADB-  and  other  development  partner-financed  projects.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment shows that (i) the executing and implementing agencies are capable \nof  carrying  out  satisfactory  accounting  and  financial  reporting  for  the  project,  and  (ii)  internal \ncontrol and audit are generally acceptable. The procurement capacity assessment indicates that \n(i)  established  arrangements  are  in  place  in  Ningxia  to  handle  various  stages  of  procurement, \n(ii)  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  experience  in  undertaking  procurement \nunder  ADB-  or  domestically  financed  projects,  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  internal  controls \nregarding procurement are generally in place. NARC has adequate capacity and experience to \nimplement  the  project.  However,  the  other  three  implementing  agencies\u2014the  governments  of \nHongsipu district, and Tongxin and Yanchi counties\u2014have little experience with ADB projects. \nConsidering  their  limited  experience,  training  on  ADB  procedures  for  financial  management, \nprocurement, disbursement, and safeguards will be provided during implementation. \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n28. \nwith  NHARG  and  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe  project  will  benefit  more  than  12,400  farmers  (about  3,200  households)  by \nincreasing  their  access  to  capacity  development  and  improved  agricultural  technologies  to \nstabilize their livelihoods and increase their incomes. In the project counties, the poverty rate is \nabove  35%\u2014much  higher  than  the  provincial  average  of  around  25.6%  and  the  national \naverage of around 10%. Among the project beneficiaries, 487 households with 2,289 members \nare recognized as rural poor households living under the national poverty line of CNY2,300. The \nbeneficiaries,  particularly  poor  households  with  limited  access  to  diversified  income,  will  reap \nlong-term  benefits  from  higher,  more  predictable,  and  more  stable  agricultural  income  by \ngrowing higher-quality grapes or Chinese dates. The farmers will participate voluntarily and the \nsustainability  of  the  benefits  will  be  ensured  through  capacity  building  for  farmers  and \nempowerment of farmer associations. The farmers involved in grape production and Xixia King \nWinery will enter into production agreements before any planting activities begin and following \nan  extensive  consultation  process.  Community  participation  and  social  responsiveness  of  the \nproject  activities  are  mainstreamed  in  the  project  design  through  consultation  processes  and \nincluded in the social action plan. \n\n30. \nGender.  A  gender  analysis  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation.  The  project  is \ncategorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  contains  design  features  to  support \nadvancing  gender  equality.  The  main  gender  issues  in  rural  PRC  and  in  the  project  area  are \nunderrepresentation  of  women  in  decision  making;  women\u2019s  limited  access  to  capacity \ndevelopment  activities;  and,  thus,  reduced  opportunities  for  better  employment.  Women\u2019s \nworkloads are increasing because they remain on the farm, while many men and young people \ngo  elsewhere  for  better  job  opportunities.  The  gender  action  plan  identifies  activities, \nimplementation  responsibilities,  and  expected  benefits  from  these  activities. 17  The  plan  will \nbenefit  and  empower  women;  and  work  toward  gender  equality  by  (i)  improving  women\u2019s \nparticipation in decision-making processes, (ii) increasing capacity development for women, and \n(iii) increasing opportunities for employment. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) were prepared and \nare  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirements.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination incorporates the results of the domestic environmental assessment \nreport  approved  in  May  2012  by  the  Ningxia  Environmental  Protection  Department.  Adequate \nconsultations were conducted with key stakeholders, including local government agencies and \ncommunities. The conclusions and recommendations of the assessment were integrated in the \nproject  design.  NHARG,  through  the  PPMO  and  PIOs,  will  be  responsible  for  EMP \nimplementation, including monitoring, mitigation, reporting, and corrective actions or measures. \nThe PPMO and PIOs will have final responsibility for handling any disputes within the grievance \nredress  mechanism.  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies  to  implement  the \nEMP  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  is  weak.  A  capacity \ndevelopment program is included in the project activities. \n\n                                                \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fThe project is expected to achieve environmental benefits, specifically  better water use \n32. \nefficiency  in  the  project  area;  and  soil  stabilization  and  reduced  erosion  resulting  from \nestablishment  of  shelterbelts.  No  major  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  Construction  and \nrehabilitation  works  are  small  and  relatively  simple.  Operating  risks  include  expanded  use  of \nagricultural  chemicals,  elevated  chemicals  in  soils,  and  increased  risk  of  workers\u2019  exposure  of \nchemicals. Most project sites are located on modified lands used for agriculture and have been \ncleared  of  natural  habitats.  No  ecologically  sensitive  sites  are  present  in  the  project  area. \nWastewater  from  grape  processing  facilities  will  be  treated  and  reused  for  crop  irrigation,  and \nwill  not  be  discharged  into  channels  leading  to  natural  waterways.  Shelterbelts  established  by \nthe  project  will  utilize  a  mix  of  native  and  long-established  tree  and  shrub  species.  Training \nprograms will include topics on safe application of agricultural chemicals and methods to reduce \napplication  rates.  Implementation  of  the  EMP  and  the  environmental  monitoring  program  is \nexpected to prevent or minimize potential impacts. \n\n33. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples. \nThe  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  safeguarding  indigenous  peoples \nwill  apply  to  the  project  as  (i)  the  Hui  people  have  both  distinctiveness  and  vulnerability  as \ndescribed by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and (ii) the project will impact on their farming \npractices  and  may  consequently  alter  their  socioeconomic  status,  including  expenditure \npatterns,  though  principally  in  a  positive  way.  Among  the  project  beneficiaries  are  570 \nhouseholds,  with  almost  3,000  people  of  the  Hui  ethnic  minority,  concentrated  in  two \nparticipating villages. Poverty and vulnerability rates are higher for Hui households than for Han \nhouseholds.  In  terms  of  poverty  incidence,  more  Hui  households  (32%)  are  considered  low \nincome  compared  with  Han  households  (16%).  The  higher  poverty  is  in  part  due  to  former \nrelocation  as  part  of  a  government  program,  but  also  to  lack  of  access  to  improved  farming \ntechniques.  As  potential  project  beneficiaries,  concerns  of  ethnic  minorities  are  addressed  as \npart  of  the  project  design;  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  prepared  an  ethnic \nminority  development  plan  to  ensure  that  participating  minorities  will  receive  social  and \neconomic  benefits  that  are  culturally  appropriate  and  gender  responsive.  The  plan  will  be \nfinalized once the production or participation agreements with farmers are finalized. \n\n34. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  No \ninvoluntary  loss  of  land,  housing,  or  access  to  income-generating  assets  is  necessary  for  the \nproject. Most of the activities are going to be implemented on state farms with clear government \nland ownership. In the participating villages, construction activities will be limited to small-scale \ninfrastructure linked to improved irrigation, such as water retention ponds, irrigation pipes, and \nfarm  access  roads.  These  will  be  constructed  on  village  land  that  is  not  being  used  for \nagricultural or other income-generating activities, and ownership of the infrastructure will remain \nwith  the  villages.  Participation  and  contribution  of  land  to  the  planting  schemes  will  be  on  a \nvoluntary  basis;  this  will  be formalized  through  the  production  or  participation  agreements  and \nmonitored by the PIOs. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nThe  project  has  some  potential  technical,  financial,  implementation,  and  institutional \nrisks. The project provides adequate measures and/or assurances to minimize these risks, and \nthe  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.18 \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nDrip irrigation systems do not \nwork to standards. \n\nGrape farmers fail to produce \nhigh-quality grapes for the \nNingxia Agricultural \nReclamation Group Co., Ltd. \n(NARC). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nrecruit  consultants \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  (i)  recruit  qualified  and  specialized \nengineering  firms  for  technical  design  of  the  drip  irrigation  systems,  \nto  help  monitor  project  design  and \n(ii) \nimplementation,  (iii)  provide  adequate  training  for  farmers  to  operate \nand  maintain  the  system,  and  (iv)  empower  water  users  associations \nto take over drip irrigation system operation and maintenance. \nNARC  will  contract  international  vineyard  and  other  expertise  to  help \nimprove  the  production  regime.  The  project  will  help  establish  a \nproduction  agreement  between  grape  growers  and  NARC \nthat \nprovides  for  an  incentive  for  farmers  to  produce  high-quality  grapes \nrather than focus purely on high yield. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n36. \nThe government and NHARG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM (footnote 13) and loan documents. \n\nThe  government  and  NHARG  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\n37. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n\n38. \nNo  withdrawals  shall  be  made  from  the  loan  account  until  the  onlending  agreement \nbetween NHARG  and NARC,  in the form  and substance satisfactory  to ADB,  shall  have been \nduly  executed  and delivered;  and  shall  have become fully  effective and binding  in  accordance \nwith its terms provided in the loan and project agreements. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$70,000,000  to the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China for the  Ningxia Irrigated Agriculture  and Water \nConservation Demonstration Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a term  of  25  years,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n22 November 2012 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nImproved \nsustainability of \nagricultural \nproduction in \nNingxia \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\n \nPercentage of land under water \nconservation irrigation, including \ndrip and sprinkler irrigation, to total \nirrigated land increased from 50% \nin 2010 to 80% by 2022 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n \nNHARG and county \nyearbooks, and \nsocioeconomic \ndevelopment plans and \nevaluation reports \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\nAssumption \nThe government \ncontinues its efforts to \npromote sustainable \ndevelopment and \nincrease farmer \nincomes. \n\nOutcome \nIncreased quality \nand value of \nhorticultural \ncrops in Ningxia \n\nAverage per capita rural income \nincreased from CNY4,675 in 2010 \nto CNY9,000 by 2022 in real terms \n\nProject review missions, \nand completion and \nevaluation reports \n\nRatio of EBIT and revenue of the \nNARC vineyard and winery \noperations (Xixia King Industrial \nCo.
