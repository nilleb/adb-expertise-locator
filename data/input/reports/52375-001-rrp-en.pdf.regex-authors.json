THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $300,000,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $100,000,000; and (ii) a B loan of up to \n$200,000,000 to Bank of Communications Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. (BOCFL) for the New \nEnergy Bus Leasing Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-term financing (with  \na tenor of up to 7 years) to BOCFL to fund the lease or purchase of new energy buses (NEBs), \nwhich are needed to reduce the climate impact of urbanization and develop public transport in a \nsustainable manner.1 ADB\u2019s financing will facilitate the company\u2019s provision of long tenor lease \nfinance to NEB operators to enable them to manage the affordability of these large assets. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Economic overview. The PRC has experienced strong economic growth since 1980. \nGross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 9.7% and per capita income increased by 8.6% \nper year during 1980\u20132014.2 The PRC economy is transitioning to a more sustainable growth \npath, with reforms undertaken in many areas. The real GDP growth rate slowed to 6.8% in 2017 \nand 6.6% in 2018. ADB estimates that GDP growth will be 6.2% in 2019 and 6.0% in 2020.3 The \nInternational Monetary Fund projects a gradual slowdown in growth from the current level to a \nreal GDP growth rate of 5.6% in 2023.4  \n \n4.  Transport sector overview. Rapid economic growth has contributed significantly to \nimprovements in human well-being and quality of life, but has also created serious social and \nenvironmental  challenges  that  constrain  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  Massive \nurbanization has led to a substantial increase in the production and use of motor vehicles in the \nPRC, which has become the largest producer and consumer of automobiles globally. Annual \nproduction capacity reached 27.81 million vehicles in 2018, with sales of 28.08 million units.5 \nThere were over 310 million motor vehicles in the PRC by the end of 2017, including 170 million \nprivate cars.6 Despite some socioeconomic benefits, the extensive use of private cars in cities is \ncausing congestion, air and noise pollution, and road accidents. Rapid motorization and the \ncountry\u2019s moderate success in controlling emissions from industrial and energy sources has made \nthe PRC\u2019s urban transport sector the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \nAccording to the China Vehicle Environmental Management Annual Report 2018, transport \nemissions are a major contributor of fine atmospheric particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers \nin  diameter  (PM )  in  some  urban  areas  (45%  in  Beijing,  29%  in  Shanghai,  and  52%  in \n2.5\n \n1  New energy buses (NEBs) refer to buses running on \u201cnew energy\u201d as defined by the Government of the PRC. Most \nbuses financed by the project are expected to be electric buses with zero direct emissions. Any plug-in hybrid buses \nfinanced will meet emission standards of at least Euro V equivalent (Euro V is an European emission standard that \ndefines the acceptable limits for exhaust emissions of vehicles). Subject to market demand, buses running on fuel \ncells may also be financed. All NEBs will have inclusive design with priority seating for vulnerable groups. \n2  ADB. 2016.

May 26. \n ", "2 \nShenzhen).7 Public transport is increasingly recognized as the solution to a potential urban \ntransport crisis. Congestion and air pollution can be alleviated by encouraging urban residents to \nshift from using private cars to public transportation and by using public vehicles with cleaner \ntechnology. This would reduce GHG emissions that contribute to global climate change while \nimproving inner city air quality. The development of public transport will also benefit directly lower \nincome people; groups with reduced mobility (e.g., the elderly and persons with disabilities); and \nwomen, who accounted for less than 30% of all car owners in the PRC in 2018. In 2016, the \nMinistry of Transport issued a policy guideline to improve the quality of public transport by \nenhancing the speed, convenience, comfort, and security of public transport services.8 In 2015, a \njoint report of the World Bank and Development Research Center of China\u2019s State Council called \nfor a new model of urbanization that would reduce growth in private car use and promote a shift \nto public transport.9 \n \n5.  Leasing sector overview. Leasing provides a good solution for long-term bus financing, \nas banks usually do not accept buses as collateral. The PRC\u2019s leasing industry has been growing \nrapidly, targeting this financing gap that traditional bank financing typically does not address. New \nleasing sales in the PRC expanded from $21.88 billion in 2008 to $265.68 billion in 2017, \nrepresenting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.97%.10 Despite rapid recent growth, \nthe PRC\u2019s financial leasing industry still needs further development. The lease penetration rate, \nmeasured as a percentage of lease finance to total GDP, was 2.21% in 2017, 12th among 50 \ncountries, indicating ample room for future growth.11 The leasing industry, with total outstanding \nlease receivables of CNY6.55 trillion, is also much smaller than the banking industry, which had \ntotal outstanding loans of CNY108.56 trillion as of September 2018. \n \n6.  Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations projects in the PRC\u2019s finance sector have \nactively supported nonbank financial institutions to target sectors not traditionally a focus of banks.  \nTo date, this includes smaller transactions for microfinance companies and larger debt lines for \nleasing companies, targeting diverse subsectors and focusing on underdeveloped segments, \nincluding green buses. ADB approved a $275 million loan program for the Clean Bus Leasing \nProject and fully disbursed the loans in 2016.12 The Global Environmental Facility funded $2.315 \nmillion in technical assistance (TA) to maximize service performance of the bus fleets.13 In 2017, \nADB approved a loan of $400 million to Minsheng Financial Leasing to support green transport \nfinance.14 Based on the uptake of the previous projects and to continue to support much-needed \ngreen transport alternatives in the PRC, ADB identified BOCFL as a good partner to implement \nthis  project.  BOCFL  has  substantial  experience  in  financing  green  buses  and  has  close \n \n7  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Ecology and Environment. 2018.

The A loan was fully disbursed in \n2018 and the B loan syndication is still in process. \n ", "3 \nrelationships with electric bus manufacturers and bus operators in the PRC. BOCFL has strong \nshareholders, sound corporate governance, an experienced management team, advanced risk \nmanagement  systems,  and  good  financial  performance.  As  a  non-deposit-taking  financial \ninstitution, BOCFL has maturity mismatches between its assets and liabilities and, therefore, has \nan ongoing need to raise longer-tenor financing to expand its green bus leasing business (with \ntypical lease terms of 5\u201310 years). \n \n7.  The design of the transaction builds on the lessons of previous ADB support for green bus \nfinance in the PRC. ADB\u2019s ex post evaluation gave a less than satisfactory rating to the earlier \nloan program for the Clean Bus Leasing Project primarily due to the applied definition of a clean \nbus, which was considered to be overly broad.15 The proposed project will only finance NEBs, \nwhich have zero or very low direct emissions. Unlike earlier projects, it will not finance clean diesel \nbuses or compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas buses. The current project also \nincorporates gender elements in the project design. Additionally, the project will benefit from the \nearlier TA to strengthen the capacity of bus operators by providing knowledge products and \ntraining materials to bus operators.16 \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  BOCFL was established in December 2007. As of December 2018, it was the third-largest \nfinancial leasing company (FLC) in the PRC with total assets of CNY231.74 billion. In line with \nthe leasing sector, BOCFL has experienced rapid growth in total assets with a CAGR of 40% \nduring 2008\u20132018. BOCFL expects its lease portfolio growth to moderate to the range of 5%\u2013\n10% per annum over the period 2020\u20132025. BOCFL is rated A2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, A \nby Fitch Ratings, and A- by S&P Global Ratings. \n \n9.  BOCFL\u2019s operations cover three business segments comprising aviation (30.9% of the \ntotal lease portfolio at 30 June 2019), shipping (28.7%), and infrastructure and other businesses \n(40.4%). The company has significantly increased the share of its leasing operations that focus \non the transport sector (aviation, shipping, and public transport); the lease portfolio in aviation and \nshipping grew from 21.9% in 2014 to 59.6% as of 30 June 2019, driven by rapid growth of \noperating lease assets in these two segments.17 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \nPublic transport leasing is within the infrastructure and other business segment, which also \nincludes energy, water supply, gas supply, wastewater treatment, culture and tourism, and \nmanufacturing. Most of the company\u2019s public transport leasing clients are local public transport \noperators owned by municipalities, and the lease assets include buses as well as rolling stock \nand other equipment of metro and light rail. The company has focused its bus leasing operations \non green buses since 2012. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership. BOCFL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Communications (BOCOM). \nBOCOM, established in 1908, is the largest nationwide joint stock commercial bank in the PRC. \n \n15 ADB. Performance Evaluation Report. PRC: Loan Program for Clean Bus Leasing (Far East Horizon Limited). Manila. \n16 The $2.315 million TA was financed by the Global Environment Facility, with the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Transport as the \nexecuting agency (footnote 13). The knowledge products include (i) an evaluation report to help bus operators select \nthe most appropriate green buses by offering operational, financial, and environmental performance benchmarks for \nvarious technology; (ii) a guidance book on scheduling and dispatching; and (iii) guidelines on improving bus \nmaintenance management, with a systematic framework and practical procedures to help bus operators improve \ngreen bus operational efficiency. \n17 By 30 June 2019, over 90% of the aviation portfolio was operating lease assets and over 70% of the shipping portfolio \nwas operating lease assets. \n ", "4 \nBOCOM\u2019s  businesses  include  commercial  banking,  securities,  trust,  financial  leasing,  fund \nmanagement, and insurance. As of 30 June 2019, BOCOM had total assets of CNY9,886.61 \nbillion (fifth among all commercial banks in the PRC), with total net income of CNY42.75 billion in \nthe first half of 2019. BOCOM is rated A2 by Moody\u2019s  Investors Service, A by Fitch Ratings, and \nA- by S&P Global Ratings. It has been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2015 and \non the Shanghai Stock Exchange since 2017. The largest ultimate beneficial owner is the \nGovernment of the PRC, with a total shareholding of over 40% through various state-owned \nenterprises. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) is the second \nlargest shareholder with an 18.70% of stake as of 30 June 2019. No other shareholders directly \nor indirectly hold more than a 5% stake in BOCOM. Integrity due diligence was conducted, and \nno significant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified.18 Although the ultimate \nbeneficial owners of BOCFL could not be identified, the potential risk is mitigated by the fact that \nthe relevant shares of BOCOM are held by the public and institutional investors, and no indirect \nshareholder other than the government and HSBC, which is also a listed entity, holds more than \na 5% indirect stake in BOCFL. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that \nit is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing. Tax integrity due diligence was not \nrequired.19 \n \n11.  Management. BOCFL is led by an experienced management team, comprised of the \npresident and three vice presidents, all of whom previously held senior positions at BOCOM. The \npresident, Zhu Yequn, joined BOCFL since its establishment. His prior positions included vice \npresident of BOCFL, director of the credit monitoring department of BOCOM, and director of the \nasset management department of BOCOM.20 \n \n12.  Governance structure. BOCFL has a well defined corporate governance structure. The \nboard of directors is responsible for the company\u2019s overall strategy, major decisions, important \ninternal  policies,  key  business  objectives,  and  senior  management  appointments.  Because \nBOCFL is a wholly owned subsidiary of BOCOM, all directors are appointed by BOCOM. The \nboard consists of six members, all of whom have extensive banking and finance experience. The \nchairperson, Zhao Jiong, previously served as the chairperson and chief executive officer of Bank \nof Communications International Trust Co. Ltd. (footnote 20). The board has three committees: a \nrisk management and related-party transactions committee, budget and audit committee, and \nremuneration and nomination committee. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n13.  ADB will provide an A loan of up to $100 million with a tenor of up to 7 years. ADB expects \nto syndicate a B loan of up to $200 million among commercial banks and other eligible B loan \nparticipants. ADB will also explore risk transfer arrangements on a portion of the A loan with \neligible counterparties.  \n \n \n18 ADB. 2003.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Use of proceeds. BOCFL will use the proceeds of the proposed loan to fund the lease or \npurchase of NEBs (footnote 1). All NEBs will have inclusive designs, with priority seating for \nvulnerable and priority needs groups such as pregnant women, the elderly, or the disabled. \n \n15.  Reporting arrangements. Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB over the \nlife of the project. BOCFL will provide ADB with financial and other reports at predetermined \nregular intervals and as requested. These reports will include unaudited semiannual financial \nstatements, audited annual financial statements, compliance certificates for financial covenants, \nperiodic reports on the underlying leases financed by BOCFL through the proposed loan, and \nannual reporting on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n16.  Providing  critically  needed  long-term  finance.  The  PRC\u2019s  leasing  sector  is  still \ndeveloping.  Most  funding  is  available  to  companies  on  a  1-year  tenor  basis.  BOCFL  has \nsignificant maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities (para 16), although it has been \nable to raise some medium-term funding in the markets on a sporadic basis. Long-tenor funding \nof 7 years from ADB, as the first development finance institution lender to BOCFL, will help \nsupport the company to provide longer-tenor financing for NEBs and improve its asset-liability \nprofile. This will in turn increase the company\u2019s capacity to expand its operations and address its \nfunding gap. \n \n17.  Catalyzing  private  sector  funding  and  support.  ADB  is  expected  to  mobilize  a \nsubstantial amount of private sector funding for this project under a B loan structure and risk \ntransfers. A mandate letter for the proposed loan facility including the B loan has been signed. \nADB is targeting some banks that do not have an existing relationship with BOCFL. Overall, this \nwill help further diversify BOCFL\u2019s long-term funding base. \n \n18.  Incorporating gender elements. ADB has worked with BOCFL to incorporate gender \nelements in the project design. At the subproject level, all NEBs financed by ADB will have \ninclusive designs, with priority seats for pregnant women and vulnerable groups. BOCFL also \ncommits to promoting gender equality at the company level by improving training and career \ndevelopment for female staff. \n \n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n19.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following strong development impacts: \n(i)  Green transport scaled-up in the People\u2019s Republic of China, including the \nexpansion  of  new  energy  bus  services  as  an  environment-friendly  and \ninclusive transport mode.21 By financing the lease of NEBs, the project will \nsupport the expanded use of low emission vehicles in public transport.

Beijing \n ", "6 \nbuses have no direct emissions of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in \ndiameter, or emissions of other pollutants (e.g., carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, \nand nitrogen oxides). The use of high-quality buses that are quiet, clean, and \ncomfortable will also encourage a modal shift from private passenger vehicles to \npublic transport. Overall, the large-scale deployment of NEBs will improve air \nquality and reduce GHG emissions, leading to significant beneficial environment \nand  climate  impact.  The  expansion  of  environment-friendly  NEB  services  is \nexpected to particularly benefit low-income commuters and other disadvantaged \ngroups with less access to private cars. \n \n(ii)  Financial leasing industry developed.22 Despite rapid growth since 2008, the \nPRC\u2019s financial leasing industry is still underdeveloped, with a lease penetration \nrate that is below other developed markets. Access to finance remains a challenge \nfor most leasing companies, particularly for long-tenor loans, and the project will \ncontribute to the alleviation of this funding bottleneck.  \n \n20.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: deployment of NEBs in the urban, \nsuburban, and intercity public transport markets increased. The project is expected to finance the \nlease of about XX NEBs by 2021. From 2021, the project will help avoid XX tons of GHG \nemissions per year through a shift from the use of private cars to the use of public transport using \nlow-emission buses.23 The project will result in XX million vehicle-kilometers of service operation \nby NEBs per year in the PRC.24 \n \n21.  Outputs. The outputs will be BOCFL\u2019s leasing operations for NEBs expanded and \nBOCFL\u2019s gender inclusiveness for human resources and NEB leasing operations improved. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n22.  Consistency with ADB  strategy and country strategy. The project supports  four \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (iv) making cities more \nlivable.25 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will increase its emphasis on mitigating GHG emissions in \nline with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. By financing NEBs, the project will help to promote \nsustainable low-carbon transport in the PRC and reduce GHG emissions. The project also \ncontributes to supporting mass public transport, which particularly benefits low-income people; it \nwill help improve mobility of the elderly, persons with disabilities, and women, thereby creating a \nsafe and healthy urban environment that improves the quality of life for all residents. The project \n \n22 Government of the PRC. 2015. State Council Guiding Opinions on Healthy Development of the Financial Leasing \nIndustry. Beijing \n23 Based on research conducted by the China Clean Development Mechanism Fund, the project assumes a private \nvehicle displacement rate of 12% for additional buses on new routes and 1.5% for replacement buses on existing \nroutes because of quality enhancement. The overall private vehicle displacement rate is estimated to be 5.2%, \nleading to GHG savings of 574 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent per NEB per day. Most (90%) of NEBs financed \nunder the project are assumed to be pure electric buses, with 10% plug-in hybrids. Using a well-to-wheel approach, \nwhich takes into account emissions from extractive and processing activities for fossil fuels as well as electricity \ngeneration, the GHG savings from energy consumption is estimated to be 78 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent \nper electric bus per day.

Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project fully \nsupports ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which focuses on creating transport systems that \nare accessible, safe, affordable, and environment-friendly. The Sustainable Transport Initiative \nOperational Plan states that ADB should help its developing member countries overcome sector \nobstacles through the wider adoption of sustainable transport, and identifies urban transport as \nan  area  in  which  ADB  should  scale  up  support  for  sustainability.27 The  operational  plan \nemphasizes private sector participation and mobilization of additional finance. The project also \nfully aligns with the multilateral development banks\u2019 Rio+20 (United Nations Conference on \nSustainable  Development)  commitment  to  provide  $175  billion  for  transport  in  developing \ncountries  during  2012\u20132022.

BOCFL\u2019s \noperations under the ADB loan have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts; any impacts \nmainly arise from the disposal of end-of-life batteries, and are unlikely to entail impacts on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.30 The project will fund the leasing of vehicles \nthat will use new energy sources. Compliance with emission standards covering motor vehicle \nengines is mandatory in the PRC, and the project is expected to have minimal environmental or \nsocial impacts. Green vehicles leased under the project will be required to meet the PRC\u2019s \npermitting, testing, and registration requirements, and follow national and local vehicle emission \nstandards and regulations. No land acquisition, physical or economic displacements, or impacts \non indigenous peoples are expected from this project.  BOCFL will apply ADB's prohibited \ninvestment activities list, exclude all projects that will have adverse environment and social \nsafeguards impacts, ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws \nand regulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.31 \n \n26.
