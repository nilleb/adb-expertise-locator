I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Mongolia for the Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger \nAreas Development Investment Program (the program). \n \n2.  The MFF will support the Ulaanbaatar City master plan by upgrading priority service and \neconomic hubs (subcenters) in ger (yurt or traditional tents) areas. It proposes an integrated \nresponse to urgently needed basic urban services and to develop urban subcenters to catalyze \ngrowth in ger areas.1 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  In 2012 Ulaanbaatar had a population of 1.3 million. Since the 1990s, it has had limited \nformal extension of its core, which largely comprises apartment blocks with comprehensive \nutility services, including dedicated heating, water, and sanitation. However, successive waves \nof in-migration with ger tents have reshaped the city\u2019s geography, with (i) little upgrading or \nextension of basic urban services; and (ii) government policy, since 2003, to give each citizen \nabout 700 square meters of land.2 A vast low-density peri-urban area, named ger areas, now \nextends around the city core, characterized by unplanned settlement of low- and medium-\nincome households with land ownership,3 unserviced plots, unpaved roads, and poor facilities. \nThe ger area population is estimated at 800,000, representing 60% of Ulaanbaatar or 30% of \nthe  country  population.  Despite  their  size,  ger  areas  have  until  recently  been  considered \ntemporary settlements. However, their official integration in the 2013 city master plan provides \nthe necessary provision to plan the redevelopment of a formal peri-urban area. \n \n4.  Living  conditions  in  ger  areas  are  difficult.  Poor  sanitation\u2014households  almost \nexclusively rely on open pit latrines\u2014and poor waste collection have created highly unsanitary \nliving conditions. Air pollution is among the most severe in the world, particularly during winter \nbecause  of  inadequate  household  heating  systems4 and  unpaved  roads.  Access to  water, \nsupplied by kiosks operated by the Ulaanbaatar Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (USUG), \nis limited.5 In 2011, most of the 40,000 people migrating to Ulaanbaatar settled in ger areas; by \n2022 the population is estimated to grow by 400,000 from in-migration and natural growth. \nUnder current situation, the forecasted population increases is a serious threat to the city \nenvironment and the health of the population if the situation is not improved. \n \n5.  Lack of long-term planning, infrastructure investment, and land use regulation in ger \nareas have resulted in haphazard development, limited availability of space for public facilities, \npoor  access  to  socioeconomic  services,  reduced  livelihood  opportunities,  and  insecure \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance financed by the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction. ADB. 2010.  Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Preparing the Ulaanbaatar Urban \nServices  and  Ger  Areas  Development  Investment  Program.  Manila  (TA  7970);  and  ADB.  2011.  Technical \nAssistance for Urban Infrastructure Development and Financing. Manila (TA 7918). \n2  Large-scale in-migration, started in 1991 during the economic transition, has been exacerbated by recent severe \nwinters (dzud). During 2000\u20132010, the population of ger areas increased by about 400,000.  \n3  Most ger residents have two types of land ownership: right of possession or right of use. Rights of possession are \ngradually converted into rights of ownership subject to an administrative procedure and a small fee.  \n4  Most households rely on unimproved individual coal stoves. \n5  Water consumption in ger areas is low at about 10 liters per capita per day (half the recommended minimum by the \nWorld Health Organization in similar context). Residents pay 2\u201310 times more than non-ger area residents. ", "2 \n \nneighborhoods. The lack of basic urban infrastructure is constraining rational and dynamic \nurban development, increasing the costs of doing business and of accessing services. The city \ncore where jobs and services are concentrated now has unprecedented congestion. The service \ngap between the city core and ger areas means ger residents are poorly integrated in the urban \neconomy; it is one of the most urgent and difficult development challenges. While various \ngovernment and development partner initiatives have significantly improved living conditions in \nger  areas,  approaches  have  generally  focused  on  specific  sectors,  failing  to  design  a \nsustainable vision and provide integrated solutions for the problems of peri-urban development.  \n \n6.  Subcenter upgrading. High construction cost,6 lack of urban planning, and inadequate \ninfrastructure constrain the upgrading of ger areas. These areas are predominately residential \nwith  pockets  of  activity  nodes,  called  subcenters,  providing  commercial  and  administrative \nservices. The influence area of a subcenter varies from 30,000 to 100,000 people. Despite the \ncritical function of subcenters in overall spatial and local development, urban services have not \nbeen  substantially  improved.  The  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  limits  economic  growth  and \nincreases negative environmental impacts.  \n  \n7.  The program approach aims to initiate a redevelopment process in ger areas. Improving \ninfrastructure within the ger area subcenters and connectivity with the city core center is critical \nfor inclusiveness and important to facilitate the movement of people and goods, develop urban \ncorridors, and create clusters of subcenters. Better urban planning combined with a network of \ninfrastructure along priority roads will initiate a structural change of subcenter urban fabric. This \nwill (i) improve residents\u2019 access to basic urban services, public space, and socioeconomic \nfacilities; (ii) support local economic development; (iii) allow residents and businesses to take \nadvantage of urban economies; and (iv) provide better housing options.7 The changes in land \nuse and higher urban density will improve water, sanitation, and heating services delivery. \n \n8.  Road map. Based on government and Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB) priorities to \nredevelop ger areas, the road map for the program will support the MUB in establishing a \nnetwork of well-developed subcenters to provide jobs, housing, and economic opportunities with \nreduced soil and air pollution. It comprises sequenced investments, municipal reforms, and \ncapacity building (policy, planning, and monitoring), with four strategic objectives: (i) expand \nroads and basic urban services (water, sewerage, and heating) within subcenters and improve \nconnectivity  to  initiate  land  use  transformation;  (ii)  increase  economic  and  public  services \nthrough  investments  in  socioeconomic  facilities  to  meet  population  needs,  increase  urban \nfunctions, and encourage job creation; (iii) increase service provider efficiency by improving \nwater supply, sewerage, and heating service operations; and (iv) strengthen institutions and \ncapacity  by  improving  urban  planning  and  subcenter  development,  community  awareness, \nparticipation and empowerment, service provider operations and management, and program \nimplementation capacity.  \n \n9.  Strategic  context  and  sector  policy.  In  February  2013,  Parliament  approved  the \nAdjustments to the Ulaanbaatar City Urban Development Master Plan 2020 and Development \nDirections 2030. The master plan produced two important outcomes: (i) integration of ger area \ndevelopment into the city master plan, and (ii) acknowledgement of the value and function of ger \narea subcenters as key elements of future city growth.8 The MUB is developing the Ger Area \n                                                \n6  Partly due to cold climate conditions and outdated construction standards. \n7  Up to 60% of subcenter households may consider exchanging their land for fully serviced apartment units. \n8  ADB has helped the MUB introduce a redevelopment strategy for ger areas through the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance [footnote 1] and ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Ulaanbaatar Water and \nSanitation Services and Planning Improvement. Manila (TA 7591). ", "3 \n \nDevelopment Program and established a Ger Area Development Agency, supervised by the \nvice mayor in charge of urban development and investment. On 30 May 2013, the city council \nresolution  No.10/38  endorsed  the  program,  subcenter  locations  under  project  1,  and \ncoordination of the investment program with the city master plan. The MUB proposed a special \npurpose development vehicle (subcenter redevelopment authority) to facilitate, supervise, and \ncoordinate the redevelopment process of the selected subcenters. In addition, the Ministry of \nEconomic  Development\u2019s  Street  Project  is  to  improve  road  conditions  in  Ulaanbaatar  and \nincludes  a  ger  area  component.  The  National  Development  Strategy  and  the  New \nReconstruction Midterm Program (2008\u20132016) constitute the national framework for program \nimplementation. The program is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  Mongolia;9 ADB\u2019s  Strategy  202010 priorities,  including \nenvironmental sustainability and private sector development; as well as the core themes of \ngreen, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan.11 \n \n10.  Policy  dialogue  and  capacity  development.  To  supplement  the  strong  policy \nframework,  policy  dialogue  and  capacity  development  will  focus  (i)  in  communities,  on \ncommunity participation, awareness, and empowerment,12 including design and implementation \nof the social and gender action plan; and establishment of community development councils \n(CDCs) and small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development councils (SDCs); (ii) in \nsubcenters,  on  subcenter  upgrading,  including  technical  guidance  for  preparing  and \nimplementing local development plans, urban zoning regulation and construction standards, and \na  development  framework  with  a  transparent  mechanism  to  regulate  land  redevelopment \ninsuring current residents are integrated in the redevelopment plan; and (iii) in the city, on the \nmaster plan through ongoing ADB technical assistance to strengthen urban planning capacity.13 \nCapacity development for water and wastewater utilities will target (i) improving the MUB and \nUSUG management contract, (ii) defining a clearer tariff road map, and (iii) providing technical \nsupport to the Water and Sewerage Regulatory Commission. For heating, the focus will be to \nensure financial sustainability and capacity of new and existing heating facilities operators in the \nselected subcenters and to strengthen provisions in management contracts. \n \n11.  Financing modality. An MFF is the proposed financing modality to promote a long-term \npartnership  between  ADB,  the  government,  and  the  MUB  to  facilitate  the  development  of \nsustainable, inclusive, and livable ger areas. The MFF will support the policy framework for the \nredevelopment of ger areas, and provide opportunities for constructive dialogue and capacity \ndevelopment on city planning, policy reforms, and physical and nonphysical investments. It will \ngenerate critical mass, predictability, and continuity for basic urban services provision in ger \nareas, and enable ADB to better respond to MUB needs.  \n \n12.  Development coordination. In preparing the program, ADB coordinated closely with \ndevelopment partners involved in Ulaanbaatar\u2019s urban sector. Three ADB-financed projects will \ndirectly support the program: (i) a bus rapid transit line from the city center to Selbe subcenter; 14 \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2012.

Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the program is improved living conditions in Ulaanbaatar. The outcome is \na network of livable, competitive, and inclusive subcenters in Ulaanbaatar\u2019s ger areas.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The program has four outputs: (i) roads and urban services are expanded within priority \nsubcenters, and connectivity between them is improved; (ii) economic and public services in \ntargeted areas are improved; (iii) service providers become more efficient; and (iv) institutions \nand  capacity  for  urban  development,  program  management,  and  service  delivery  are \nstrengthened. The program will be implemented over three tranches. \n \n15.  Project 1. The first tranche will support implementation of a city master plan to develop \nSelbe and Bayankhoshuu subcenters: (i) extend the sewerage network from the city core: \ncollector main (6.1 kilometers [km]) and sewer pipes (2.9 km); (ii) within subcenters, develop \npriority roads (15 km), water supply network (18.6 km), sewerage network (20 km), district \nheating  network  (21  km),  and  five  heating  facilities  using  most  suitable  state-of-the-art \nenvironmentally  friendly  technologies; (iii)  construct  social  and  economic facilities,  i.e., two \nkindergartens, green areas, and small squares; and two business incubators, associated with \ntwo vocational training centers; (iv) improve USUG operations and service delivery efficiency of \nwater supply and wastewater collection; and (v) provide institutional and capacity development \nto (a) prepare detailed design and construction supervision; (b) support community participation, \nawareness,  and  SME  development;  (c)  improve  subcenter  redevelopment;  (d)  strengthen \nprogram management office (PMO) capacity; and (e) support service provider reforms. \n \n16.  Projects  2  and  3.  The  projects  will  (i)  expand  coverage  of  similar  investments  in  \nproject 1 subcenters, and in other subcenters in the northern and eastern ger areas; and  \n(ii) improve road connections between targeted subcenters. Khaniin Material and Market Area \nsubcenters are tentatively targeted for project 2, and Ulyastai and Amgalan subcenters for \nproject 3. Other subcenters may be considered. Heating solutions developed under tranches 2 \nand 3 will prioritize gas-fired state-of-the-art environmentally friendly technology, subject to \nsatisfactory due diligence.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The total cost of the program is estimated at $320.00 million. The cost of Project 1 is \nestimated at $104.52 million (Table 1). The government has requested an MFF in an amount up \nto $163.70 million, or 51.2% of the investment program, from a blend of ADB resources: the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) and ordinary capital resources (OCR), and cofinancing to be \nadministered by ADB. This includes cofinancing from the Urban Environmental Infrastructure \nFund16 (UEIF) under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility in the first tranche and may \n                                                \n15 TenGer Financial Group will onlend a portion of an ADB private sector loan to XacBank.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The MUB will be the executing agency for the program. The MUB\u2019s Urban Development \nand Investment Office will be responsible for coordinating program implementation. A PMO will \nbe  established  under  the  vice  mayor  in  charge  of  urban  development  and  investment.  A \nprogram steering committee, chaired by the mayor of Ulaanbaatar and comprising government \nofficials, has been established to provide strategic and policy guidance. The program will be \nimplemented from December 2013 to December 2022. Project 1 implementation will start in \nDecember 2013 and be completed by December 2017.   \n ", "7 \n \n21.  A procurement plan is included in the facility administration manual (FAM).18 Goods and \nworks financed under the ADB loan and grant will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB has approved advance contracting and \nretroactive financing of up to 20% for all tranches. The eligible expenditures incurred, not \nexceeding  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the  ADB  loan  documents,  would  be  financed \nretroactively from the ADB loans and grant, as applicable, upon effectiveness. The government \nhas been informed that approval of advance procurement actions and retroactive financing does \nnot in any way commit ADB to finance the program. The project management consultant will \nassist the PMO in implementing project 1 and provide training in project management, financial \nmanagement, disbursement, and reporting. Details of consulting services inputs and outline \nterms of reference are in the FAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period (program)  December 2013\u2013December 2022 \nEstimated completion date (project 1)  December 2017 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering  committee  (mayor,  Ulaanbaatar  (chair),  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Environment and Green \nDevelopment, MUB,  Ministry of Construction and Urban Development, \nrelevant departments and agencies from the MUB) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Municipality of Ulaanbaatar \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Urban Development and Investment Office under the MUB \n(iv)  Implementation unit  The PMO is established and will be transferred under the vice mayor in \ncharge of MUB\u2019s Urban Development and Investment Office \nProcurement (tranche 1)  International competitive  13 contracts \nbidding \nConsulting services (tranche 1)  Quality- and cost-based  International:  222.5  person-months; \nselection  national: 749 person-months  \n  Individual selection (PMO staff)  National: 325 person-months \nRetroactive financing and/or advance  ADB Management approved advance contracting and retroactive financing \ncontracting (tranche 1)  for program management activities and consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n22.  Technical  due  diligence  included  comparative  analyses,  technical  specifications, \nsustainability, design methods, and standards specific to ger areas and the cold climate. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic and financial internal rates of return confirmed the viability of the MFF and  \nproject 1 under adverse scenarios. The estimated costs were valued at their economic prices \n                                                \n18 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nusing  the  domestic  price  numeraire.  Benefits  include  incremental  water  sales  computed \naccording to willingness-to-pay and resource cost savings, reduced health risks from water-\nrelated disease and outdoor air pollution, and annualized increase in land rent as well as \nsavings in vehicle operating costs as a result of the project. The base case results indicate \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  of  15.1%\u201325.1%,  exceeding  the  assumed  economic \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. Financial internal rates of return were calculated for revenue-\ngenerating subprojects and compared with the weighted average costs of capital, estimated at \n0.75% for water supply and sewerage and 1.31% for heating services. Revenues calculated \ninclude incremental tariffs from improved water, sanitation, and heating services. The base case \nresults show financial internal rates of return of 3.3% for water supply and sewerage and 3.7% \nfor heating services. The affordability analysis confirms the proposed tariffs for water sanitation \nand heating fall within the willingness-to-pay and affordability limits of target beneficiaries. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Assessments of financial management and procurement capacity confirm the capacity to \nmanage  finances  and  undertake  procurement  under  the  investment  program.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained, discussed, and agreed with \nthe government and the MUB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the FAM. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the program will \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the program. ADB retains the right to suspend or cancel the entire program in \ncase of proven wrongdoing. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  Poverty,  social,  and  gender  analyses  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines.19 Project 1 will benefit about 129,000 households with improved access to water \nsupply and sewerage, roads, heating services, kindergarten facilities, business incubators, and \nvocational  training  programs.20 A  social  action  plan  was  prepared  to  ensure  community \nparticipation in project planning, implementation, and monitoring.21 It will (i) establish a CDC and  \nSDC  in  each  subcenter;  (ii)  develop  a  comprehensive  information,  education,  and \ncommunication campaign in the ger area redevelopment schemes, SME development plan, \nbasic hygiene practices, water conservation, and operation and maintenance of social and \neconomic services; and (iii) strengthen community-based monitoring and evaluation of new \nbasic infrastructure and service delivery. Contracts for construction will require contractors to \ncomply  with  core  labor  standards  and  applicable  national  labor  laws  and  regulations,  and \nprovide HIV/AIDS awareness training.  \n \n26.  Project 1 is designed as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plan for the \ninvestment  program  will  ensure  gender  mainstreaming  in  project  outputs  including  \n(i) representation by women on CDCs and SDCs; (ii) universal design features in infrastructure \nimprovements  (sidewalks,  lighting,  access  ramps,  seating  at  bus  stops),  and  women\u2019s \nparticipation in all community consultation activities, such as planning and design on improved \nsubcenter infrastructure and services; (iii) access to vocational training;  and (iv) access to \nemployment opportunities generated by the project. Poverty, gender, and social assessments \nwill help prepare subsequent tranches to determine their categorization and required actions. \n                                                \n19 Summary of Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Based on the 2011 National Statistical Office Khoroo population estimates. \n21 The social action plan is accessible in the FAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Environment.  The  MUB  prepared  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework.22 Project 1 is categorized B for environment. An initial environmental examination \nwas disclosed.23 It complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and is deemed \nadequate. Environmental impacts are anticipated during construction, including dust and noise \n(arising from earthworks, transport, and handling of aggregate materials and waste), temporary \ntraffic disturbance, risks to community and occupational health and safety, and impacts of the \nheating subcomponent operations (gas emissions, ash, and slag). Mitigation measures defined \nin the environmental management plan, such as construction site management and regular \nmonitoring of the project\u2019s environmental performance during construction and operation, will \nreduce  anticipated  impacts  and  other  construction-related  health  and  safety  concerns  to \nacceptable levels. Subsequent projects are expected to be categorized B for environment. \n \n28.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  resettlement framework  prepared for  the \nprogram outlines procedures required to prepare satisfactory land acquisition and resettlement \nplans (LARPs) and stipulates arrangements for consultation and public participation, grievance \nredress, and monitoring and evaluation. Project 1 is categorized A for resettlement. LARPs were \nprepared for Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters and disclosed to the affected people in their \nlocal language. Copies of the LARPs are available in subdistrict and community offices in the \nproject 1 area. While road design is optimized to minimize the resettlement impact, small strips \nof land (3,800 square meters) will be acquired to widen roads in the two subcenters. The project \nwill affect about 12 residential structures, 32 toilets, 21 ground attachments, five gers, and 75 \nfences; and a total of 75 households and 379 people. The LARPs will be updated based on a \ncensus of affected persons and a detailed measurement survey during project implementation. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. Project 1 is categorized C for indigenous people. Subsequent \nprojects are expected to be categorized C. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and detailed in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelay in project  The government will ensure that the PMO is staffed with experienced professionals. A \nimplementation  procurement specialist will be recruited in advance to assist with the tendering process. \nChanges in city  Provisions are included to strengthen local and city master planning to ensure consistency \nmaster plan and  and alignment of the planning process and strategic direction. Continuous dialogue is to \npolitical consideration   strengthen awareness in the MUB, Ministry of Economic Development, and MCUD. \nLack of community  Throughout implementation, community engagement and private sector involvement will \nand private sector  be  supported.  The  MUB,  supported  by  the  program,  will  facilitate,  supervise,  and \ninvolvement in  coordinate the redevelopment process of subcenters and guide a fair land redevelopment \nsubcenter  process.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the FAM and loan documents. The government has given ADB certain undertakings for the \nMFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  Specific  covenants  and \nconditions agreed by the government with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set \nforth in the loan, grant, and project agreements for the respective tranches. \n \n32.  ADB  will  consider financing  subsequent tranches  if  the government  adheres to  the \ngeneral  agreement  for  the  MFF  as  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The \ngovernment  should  also  comply  with  specific  conditions,  assurances,  and  conditions  for \ndisbursement for EIB-cofinanced components of a subproject for project 1. Progress toward \nachieving the outputs and expected outcomes in the design and monitoring frameworks for the \nprogram and project 1 will be among the decision-making criteria for financing subsequent \ntranches under the MFF. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove  the  provision  of  financing  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  in  an \naggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding  $163,700,000  equivalent  to  Mongolia  for  the \nUlaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development Investment Program, comprising \n(i)  loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  applicable  policies  relating  to  Special \nFunds resources, subject to conditions set forth in paragraph 18 of this report; \n(ii)  loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; and \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of cofinancing under the MFF to be provided by the \nUrban Environmental Infrastructure Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership \nFacility and other developmental partners as described in paragraph 17 of this \nreport; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n19 November 2013 ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n    Data Sources   \n  Performance Targets and  and Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By 2028:     Assumption \nImproved living  Poverty headcount index reduced by  National  Policy environment supports \nconditions in  30% (baseline: 23.5% in 2012)   Statistical Office  urban development and \nUlaanbaatar  reports   increased investments in \nIncidence of waterborne diseases  Government  urban infrastructure. \nreduced by 30% (baseline: 90,310 in  public health    \n2012)  statistics  Risk \nAir pollution in Ulaanbaatar reduced  National  Urban infrastructure \nby 30% (baseline: 1.286 PM Statistical Office  investments are constrained \n10 \nconcentration in 2012)  reports  by fiscal and political factors. \nOutcome  By 2024:     Assumptions \nA network of livable,  % of population with improved access  MUB report on  Political support and \ncompetitive, and  to water, sanitation, and heating  urban  investment in urban \ninclusive subcenters in  increased to 50% (baseline: 0% for  construction and  infrastructure continue \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s ger (yurt  water 0%; 0% for sanitation, and 0%  districts records  throughout the program. \nor traditional tents)  for heating in 2012) in targeted areas  \n \nareas  Improved services and urban \nAverage density in targeted subcenter  MUB report on \n  governance lead to \nincreased to 120 persons per ha  urban \n  sustained economic growth \n(average baseline: 50 persons per ha  construction and \n  in the ger areas. \nin 2010)  districts records  \n \n  Number of business establishments  MUB report on  Risks \n  increased by 30% (baseline: 33,140 in  urban  Insufficient time and \n  2012) in targeted areas  construction and  resources are devoted to \n  districts records   community mobilization. \n \n \nLack of private sector \nUnit production cost of water  reduced  USUG operation \nparticipation  \nby 50% (baseline: MNT5,940/ cubic  and financial \nmeter in 2011)  reports \nOutputs         \n1.
