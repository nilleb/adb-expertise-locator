The  report \nalso  describes  proposed  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capital  Market \nDevelopment  Phase  III,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe  CMDP  will  support  the  government\u2019s  key  reform  priorities  aimed  at  higher  and \n2. \nsustainable investment growth and transformation to a higher income economy, sustained by an \nincreased  contribution  of  the  domestic  capital  market.  The  reform  priorities  under  the  CMDP \ninclude  efforts  to  enhance  financial  sector  stability  through  better  coordination  between \nregulatory  oversight  agencies  and  measures  to  enhance  transparency.  The  CMDP  aims  to \nincrease  capital  market  efficiency  and  depth  through  strengthening  the  capital  market \ninfrastructure  (demutualization  of  the  stock  exchange),  promoting  competition  in  the  securities \nmarket, developing the domestic bond market, and financial product development. The CMDP \nalso aims to expand the investor base and support Thailand\u2019s efforts to integrate with regional \ncapital  markets.  The  development  policy  letter  is  in  Appendix  3  and  the  policy  matrix  with  the \nmedium-term direction is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM   \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  challenge  for  Thailand  is  to  transform  from  a  middle-income  to  a  high-income \n3. \neconomy. This requires significant investments in productive activities, including infrastructure, \nas well as education and other social sectors. The 1997 crisis shows that absence of balanced \ngrowth of financial sector increases vulnerability to economic instability and this can result in a \nsignificant  increase  in  poverty.  The  government  recognizes  these  challenges  and  considers  a \nwell-developed  capital  market  central  to  achieving  longer-term  economic  transformation.  The \nThai capital market is underperforming on key indicators compared to its peers in the region.1 \nThe  financial  system  remains  highly  regulated,  fee  structures  are  fixed  in  many  areas,  and \nmarket  participants  are  subject  to  closely  monitored  rules-based  supervision  in  both  debt  and \nequity  markets.  Capital  flows  are  moderately  restricted  and  the  product  choice  for  investors \nremains  limited.  The  inclusiveness  of  the  poorest  20%  households  is  limited.  Savings  rates \naverage  about  3%  for  low  income  households  and  only  about  8%  of  low  income  households \nhave  financial  assets  greater  than  $1,500.  The  government  recognizes  that,  by  addressing \nthese structural and regulatory impediments and developing the domestic capital market and its \nintegration  with  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  markets,  Thailand  can \nexpand sources of financing for the public and private sectors, improve inclusiveness, enhance \nthe stability of the financial sector, and deepen its integration with the global economy. \n \n4. \nThe global financial crisis and its adverse impact on the Thai economy in 2009 exposed \nsignificant  weaknesses  in  its  domestic  financial  system,  including  insufficient  depth  of  the \ndomestic  capital  market  to  finance  public  and  private  sector  investments.  Countries  with  well-\nfunctioning  and  liquid  local  bond  markets  were  better  able  to  cope  with  shocks  to  the  global \ncredit markets. Key lessons from the crisis include the importance of strong coordination among \nfinancial  sector  regulators  and  sharing  of  information  to  detect  systemic  risks  to  the  financial \nsystem  and  enforce  financial  regulations.  The  crisis  provided  additional  momentum  to  the \ngovernment and stakeholders to agree on the way forward for capital market development. \n                                                 \n1 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance Sector Assessment (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ninvestment  and  savings,  and  (viii)  developing \n\nThe Government\u2019s Capital Market Development Master Plan, 2009\u20132013 is the anchor \n5. \nfor  the  CMDP.  Development  of  the  master  plan  was  initiated  in  2006  under  the  previous \nGovernment and it was formulated with private sector participation through representatives on \nthe  Capital  Market  Development  Working  Committee  (CMDWC),  demonstrating  widespread \nstakeholder support across the political spectrum. This broad-based support was necessary to \nensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  reforms.  A  subcommittee  under  the  CMDWC  was \nestablished in late 2009, tasked with overseeing, monitoring, and implementing the master plan \nunder the coordination of the Fiscal Policy Office at the Ministry of Finance (MOF).   \n \n6. \nThe  master  plan  embraces  all  relevant  dimensions  of  capital  markets,  including  the \nequity market, bond market, derivatives market (including commodities), and money market. It \nconsists  of  eight  key  policy  components,  each  time-bounded:  (i)  abolishing  the  monopoly  and \nimproving  the  competitiveness  of  the  Thai  stock  exchange,  (ii)  liberalizing  the  securities \nbusiness to promote market efficiency, (iii) legal reform, (iv) streamlining the tax system related \nto  financial  products,  (v)  developing  financial  products  including  those  that  help  mitigate  risk \nsuch  as  interest  rate  derivatives,  (vi)  establishing  a  national  savings  fund,  (vii)  developing  a \nthe  domestic  bond  market. \nculture  of \nImplementation  is  under  way  and  early  successes  include  the  government\u2019s  approval  of \nproposed legislation for demutualization of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).  \n \nThe  CMDP  is  anchored  to  the  master  plan  in  four  ways.  First,  it  is  a  single  tranche \n7. \noperation covering the reform period (1 October 2007\u201330 March 2010) that lays the foundations \nfor  longer-term  development  of  the  capital  market.  It  also  covers  the  first  months  of \nimplementation  of  the  capital  market  master  plan.  Second,  although  the  CMDP  is  a  single \ntranche  operation,  it  is  linked  to  a  medium-term  framework  through  the  Post-Program \nPartnership  Framework  (P3F)  covering  the  next  21  months  of  implementation  of  the  capital \nmarket  master  plan\u2014signaling  a  commitment  from  both  the  government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  continue  policy  dialogue  and  support  for  capital  market  reforms. \nThird, ADB has actively collaborated with the government on capital market reform since 2006, \nincluding carrying out diagnostic studies on the capital market, providing input to formulation of \nthe  capital market  master  plan,  policy  recommendations  on  legislative  and  regulatory  reforms, \nSET  demutualization,  and  support  for  reform  implementation.2 The  master  plan  is  one  of  the \nprincipal outcomes of these TA projects. Fourth, TA associated with the CMDP is proposed to \nsupport  the government  in  implementing  critical  follow-up  policy  measures  under  the  P3F  and \nthe master plan (para. 27).  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe impact of the CMDP is an expanded, diversified, stable and inclusive capital market \nleading to increased domestic financing of investment. By 2015, the CMDP is expected to have \nincreased the size, depth, and liquidity of Thailand\u2019s capital market\u2014increasing the contribution \nof the capital market to domestic financing. This will be done through more robust competition in \ndomestic  capital  markets,  world  class  capital  market  infrastructure,  better  coordination  among \nregulatory  oversight  agencies,  and  financial  product  and  services  innovation.  By  2015,  the \nCMDP  is  expected  to  have  increased  poor  households\u2019  participation  in  the  finance  sector \ndevelopment  process  through  increased  savings  and  holdings  of  financial  assets.  This  will  be \ndone  through  product  development,  expanding  coverage  of  pensions,  development  of  the \nsecondary mortgage market supplemented with public education programs on financial literacy.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2006.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Thailand  for \nCapital Market Development Phase II. Manila.  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n\fThe  outcome  of  the  CMDP  will  be  an  improved  and  prudentially  sound  capital  market \n9. \nwhere  market  participants  operate  efficiently  and  innovatively.  This  will  be  reflected  in  a \nstrengthened policy, regulatory, and agency coordination framework.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  CMDP  supports  the  government  efforts  in four  core  reform  areas:  (i) strengthened \nregulatory  coordination  and  enhanced  investor  protection;  (ii)  increased  market  efficiency, \nliquidity,  and  transparency;  (iii)  strengthened  market  infrastructure  and  intermediaries;  and \n(iv) new  products  and  an  expanded  investor  base  through  enhanced  education  and  improved \nrisk management. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput  1:  Strengthened  Regulatory  Coordination  and  Enhanced  Investor \nProtection \n\n \n11. \nThe CMDP supports the government\u2019s agenda to improve the regulatory framework for \nthe  capital  markets  and  to  provide  better  coordination  among  the  key  regulatory  oversight \nagencies.  The  main  objective  is  to  ensure  financial  sector  stability.  The  following  measures \ntoward  achieving  these  goals  were  accomplished  before  the  Board\u2019s  consideration  of  the \nCMDP. \n \nDevelopment  of  the  Capital  Market  Development  Master  Plan.  The  government \n12. \ndeveloped  and  on  9  November  2009  approved  its  medium-term  Capital  Market  Development \nMaster Plan, 2009\u20132013. ADB provided input to the formulation of the master plan through TA \n(footnote 2). The plan covers eight critical reform areas, many of which the CMDP supports. To \nmonitor  implementation  of  the  master  plan,  a  subcommittee  for  implementing  and  monitoring \nwas created at the end of 2009. It has met three times and is facilitating the implementation of \nkey  reforms.  Its  first  success  was  to  facilitate  cabinet  approval  of  draft  legislation  covering \ndemutualization  of  the  SET,  which  includes  measures  to  inject  competition  in  this  sector.  The \nCMDWC is responsible for coordinating among the key regulators. Over the medium term, it is \nto become a formal body responsible for coordinating issues on financial system stability. \n \n13. \nEnhancing  the  surveillance  and  enforcement  capabilities  of  the  Securities  and \nExchange  Commission.  In  2008,  amendments  were  made  to  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission  (SEC) \nthe  SEC\u2019s  operational  effectiveness.  Key \namendments  include  (i)  revised  criteria  for  selecting  the  SEC  board  and  setting  up  a \nmanagement  board  to  concentrate on  the  issuance  of  rules  and  regulations  governing  day-to-\nday  operations;  (ii) cooperation  between  the  SEC  and  foreign  regulators  regarding  information \ndisclosure  and  the  suppression  of  cross-border  securities  fraud\u2014to  allow  the  SEC  to  sign  the \nInternational  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  multilateral  memorandum  of \nunderstanding and to become a fully compliant A signatory; and (iii) enhanced protection of the \nrights of minority shareholders of publicly listed companies. Over the medium term and by 2012, \nthe SEC proposes to submit legislation to Parliament to use civil laws and penalties as well as \nadministrative sanctions in enforcement actions and to provide legal immunity for the SEC and \nits commissioners in performing their official duties.  \n \n14. \nDeposit insurance. The government introduced measures to strengthen the stability of \nthe financial system. Deposit insurance was a key measure, achieved through the enactment of \nthe  Deposit  Protection  Agency  Act  in  February  2008  and  the  establishment  of  the  Deposit \nProtection Agency (DPA) in August 2008. This reform was timely as it was critical to mitigating \nthe  risks  of  the  financial  crisis  that  intensified  in  September  2008.  The  blanket  guarantee  on \nbank  deposits  was  extended  to  2011,  aligned  with  the  phase-in  of  the  deposit  insurance \n\nto  enhance \n\nlegislation \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\fscheme.  The  new  scheme,  which  came  into  effect  in  August  2008,  will  be  phased  in  over  5 \nyears.  The  deposit  insurance  ceiling  will  be  phased  down  from  the  blanket  guarantee  to  B1 \nmillion.  The  DPA  will  collect  a  premium  to  fund  the  deposit  insurance  and  the  government \nfunded the initial capital of B1 billion. The DPA will act as liquidator in case of failed and closed \nfinancial institutions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Increased Market Efficiency, Liquidity, and Transparency \n\ntoward  achieving \n\nfollowing  measures \n\n \n15. \nThe CMDP supports the government\u2019s agenda to liberalize the domestic capital markets \nto  improve  efficiency,  as  well  as  efforts  to  increase  liquidity  through  development  of  the \ndomestic  bond  market.  The \nthese  goals  were \naccomplished before the Board\u2019s consideration of the CMDP.  \n \nDomestic  bond  market.  The  government  introduced  a  series  of  measures  to  develop \n16. \nthe  domestic  bond  market,  create  deeper  government  benchmark  yields  to  price  corporate \nsecurities,  and  improve  transparency.  The  amended  Public  Debt  Management  Act,  November \n2007 enabled the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) to undertake debt market activity for \nbond  market  development;  prior  to  the  amendments,  the  PDMO  was  only  permitted  to  issue \ndebt to finance the national government deficit set within prudential debt limits. In March 2010, \nthe  government  established  the  Bond  Market  Development  Fund  (BMDF)  and  issued  the \noperational criteria of the BMDF and investment strategy to deal with issuance of government \nbonds generating surplus cash. The BMDF is separate to, but will be overseen by, the PDMO. \nThis  will  enable  the  PDMO  to  adopt  cash  management  systems  to  permit  prefunding  of \ngovernment  bond  maturities  to  reduce  the  refinancing  risk\u2014the  first  step  toward  more  active \npublic  debt  management.  As  part  of  this  strategy,  the  government  issued  B80  billion  savings \nbonds of 5-year maturity targeted at retail customers in July 2009. \n \n17. \nCapital  controls.  The  government  recognizes  the  need  to  relax  restrictions  on  capital \nflows to support deepening of the domestic capital market. Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, \nThailand  has  introduced  a  number  of  restrictions  on  capital,  most  recently  in  2006.  ADB  TA \nassisted  the  BOT  to  undertake  a  review  of  restrictions  on  capital  flows  that  have  a  negative \nimpact  on  capital  market  development  (footnote  2).  Based  on  the  review\u2019s  recommendations, \nthe  BOT  introduced  some  relaxations  on  the  capital  account  in  February  2010\u2014easing \nrestrictions on  capital controls  to  allow  Thai  investment  abroad  and  foreign  exchange  hedging \ntransactions.  It  plans  to  adopt  and  implement  suitable  options  during  2009\u20132012  that  will \naddress  exchange  control  issues  impeding  capital  market  development.  The  government\u2019s \napproach will be cautious and will involve a sequenced plan to ease restrictions on cross-border \nrestrictions and other impediments.  \n \n18. \nRegional  capital  markets  integration.  Thailand  is  actively  collaborating  with  other \nASEAN member states in promoting capital market integration in ASEAN to develop deep and \nliquid  bond  markets  in  Asia  and  improve  cross-border  capital  flows  in  the  ASEAN  region. \nThailand\u2019s  SEC  is  the  secretariat  of  the  ASEAN  Capital  Markets  Forum,  which  leads  the \nintegration drive. In April 2009, based on ADB TA, the Thai SEC coordinated and submitted a \nreport detailing recommendations on regional capital market integration to the ASEAN finance \nministers. The ASEAN  Capital Markets Forum approved the Implementation Plan 2015, which \nsets  out  a  broad  framework  to  strengthen  ASEAN  capital  market  development  and  integration \nby 2015. It offers key initiatives under three broad themes: (i) creating an enabling environment \nfor  regional  integration,  (ii)  creating  market  infrastructure  and  regionally  focused  products  and \nintermediaries,  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  implementation  process.  The  plan  has  six  working \ngroups and the Thai SEC chairs the cross-border liberalization for products and services. The \nThai  SEC  presented  the  working  group\u2019s  implementation  progress  report  at  the  12th  ASEAN \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCapital  Markets  Forum  in  February  2010  in  Bangkok.  Thailand  has  also  completed \nharmonization of ASEAN Plus standards on disclosure requirements for cross-border equity and \nofferings, mutual recognition frameworks for market professionals, offering documents, and the \nprovision of products and services by market intermediaries.3 \n \n19. \nSimplify  taxes  on  financial  transactions.  One  of  the  core  components  of the  capital \nmarket  master  plan  is  to  simplify  taxes  on  financial  transactions  that  impede  capital  market \ndevelopment.  Measures  accomplished  under  the  CMDP  include  the  following:  (i)  the  business \ntax  on  treasury  portfolio  activities  of  financial  instruments  traded  on  exchanges  has  been \nreduced  from  3.30%  to  0.01%,  and  (ii)  the  Revenue  Department  in  the  MOF  has  set  up  a \nworking committee to review recommendations under ADB TA (footnote 2) for rationalizing tax \non financial instruments during implementation of the capital market master plan.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Strengthened Market Infrastructure and Intermediaries \n\n \n20. \nThe  CMDP  supports  the  government\u2019s  goals  of  strengthening  the  market  infrastructure \nand  increasing  intermediaries  by  liberalizing  the  sector.  Critical  reforms  include  efforts  to \ndemutualize  the  SET  and  increase  competition  in  providing  alternative  trading  platforms  and \nliberalizing the securities market, among others. The following measures toward achieving these \ngoals were accomplished before the Board\u2019s consideration of the CMDP. \n \nStock  Exchange  of  Thailand  demutualization  and  competition  in  platforms.  The \n21. \ngovernment  and  the  SET  recognize  that  the  current  structure  of  the  SET  is  increasingly \ninappropriate for a modern capital market. The government\u2019s aim is to corporatize the SET and \nto increase competition in trading venues. The government, the SET, and the SEC have agreed \nto  the  following  sequence  of  reforms:  (i)  the  SET  is  to  initiate  the  demutualization  process \nthrough  internal  reorganization;  (ii)  the  SEC  is  to  conduct  public  consultation  on  the  main \nproposals  for  SET  demutualization;  and  (iii)  the  SEC  is  to  draft  legislation  covering \ndemutualization  leading  to  an  initial  public  offering  of  the  SET\u2014allowing  competing  trading \nvenues,  allowing  competing  providers  of  settlement  infrastructure,  and  allowing  the  SET  to \nprovide more open access and remote access to others who are not market intermediaries. The \nSEC  drafted  legislation  that  was  approved  by  the  cabinet  in  February  2010  and  will  be \nsubmitted to Parliament later in the year. The SET expects the corporatization to take place in \n2010 and the initial public offering in 2011. ADB TA and staff support has been provided to the \ngovernment and the SET over the policy period 2006\u20132010.4   \n \n22. \nLiberalizing  the  securities  market.  The  SEC  has  introduced  measures  to  enhance \ncompetition  in  the  capital  market  by  (i)  publishing  a  timetable  for  removal  of  the  SET  rule \ncontrolling brokerage commissions, and (ii) publishing its intention to remove restrictions on the \nnumber of brokerage licenses by 2012.  The SEC intends to follow through on these initiatives \nby  liberalizing  the  brokerage  commission  for  all  investors  during  2010\u20132012.  The  Financial \nInstitutions  Business  Act  passed  in  February  2008  allows  companies  other  than  financial \ninstitutions  to  provide  housing  finance  for  low-  and  middle-income  earners.  Over  2009\u20132010, \nthe  Secondary  Mortgage  Corporation  (SMC)  plans  to  develop  pass-through  models  or \nequivalent that incorporate incentives for commercial banks to develop the secondary mortgage \nmarket. Supported by ADB TA (footnote 2), strategies for improving the operational efficiency of \nthe  SMC  were  developed  under  the  CMDP,  including  new  business  models  built  on  the \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005.

The  demutualization  of  the  SET,  liberalization  of  the \nsecurities  market,  development  of  the  bond  market  and  secondary  mortgage  market  will \nimprove  access  to  finance  and  this  should  indirectly  benefit  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. \n \n\n4. \n\nOutput  4:  New  Products  and  Expanded  Investor  Base  through  Improved \nEducation and Improved Risk Management \n\n \n23. \nThe  CMDP  supports  the  goals  of  the  government  and  industry  groups  of  promoting \nfinancial  product  and  service  innovations  and  expanding  the  investor  base.  Enhancing  the \nfinancial literacy of the public and better risk management of wealth are critical components of \ninnovation  and  longer-term  poverty  reduction.  The  following  measures  were  accomplished  or \nare ongoing prior to the Board\u2019s consideration of the CMDP. \n \n24. \nInterest  rate  derivatives.  To  satisfy  the  Thailand  Futures  Exchange  (TFEX)  on  the \ndemand for interest rate derivatives and its introduction, the CMDP recognizes the importance \nof involving the customer base\u2014bank treasurers and long-term bond investors\u2014in design and \nfeasibility discussions. The BOT, in consultation with the SEC and industry groups, completed \nan  assessment  in  February  2010  under  ADB  TA  of  the  demand  for  interest  rate  and  bond \nfutures. The study was coordinated with TFEX and based on its findings, interest rate and bond \nfutures  are  proposed  to  be  introduced  by  the  end  of  2010.  TFEX  launched  gold  futures  on \n2 February 2009. \n \n25. \nSecuritization  of  cash  flows.  The  government  proposed  a  draft  amendment  to  the \nsecuritization  law  to  Parliament  in  January  2010  to  permit  securitization  of  future  cash  flows. \nFrom July 2009 to September 2010, the SEC has been consulting with the industry to examine \nimpediments to and possible resolutions for introducing a range of new bond instruments such \nas covered bonds. The SEC approved the issuance of sukuk bonds (Islamic finance product) in \nNovember 2009. \n \n26. \nPublic education. The government and industry recognize the limited investor base and \nthe need for greater social inclusiveness in capital markets\u2014via individual investments as well \nas  pensions.  A  number  of  activities  have  been  carried  out  to  improve  the  public\u2019s  financial \nliteracy.  At  the  start  of  2009,  the  SET  reorganized  its  educational  activities  (including \nprofessional education) within a separate subsidiary, the Capital Market Development Fund, to \nprovide  investor  education  and  industry  training.  The  Fiscal  Policy  Office  conducted  public \neducation  programs  in  September  2009  and  March  2010  to  deepen  understanding  of  how \nindividuals can meet their pension needs with public programs, and an education strategy was \nimplemented to raise awareness of the need for savings and capital market investments (both \nequity and fixed-income products) as vehicles for pension savings. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe  Development  Policy  Letter  (Appendix  3)  sets  out  the government\u2019s  reform  agenda \nfor the next 2\u20133 years, building on the reform momentum supported by ADB TA since 2006 and \nthe  program.  To  ensure  the  sustained  momentum  of  the  reforms,  the  government  and  ADB \nhave agreed to a P3F for the next 30 months, creating the basis for continuous policy dialogue \nto  follow  through  on  policies  required  for  long-term  structural  adjustments  under  the  capital \nmarket  master  plan.  The  P3F  focuses  on  10  policy  measures  to  be  implemented  in  the  short \nterm  (April 2010\u2013March  2011)  and  nine  policy  measures  to  be  implemented  over  the  medium \nterm  (April  2011\u2013December  2012)\u2014advancing  reforms  under  the  capital  market  master  plan, \n\nPost-Program Partnership Framework \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProgram Cost and Financing \n\nformalizing  regulatory  coordination,  implementing  SET  demutualization  and  competition  in \nalternative trading platforms.5  \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 to finance the CMDP from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The  government  has  provided  ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n29. \nThe  size  of  the  CMDP  loan  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors  required  to  support \nimplementation  of  reforms.6 The  key  considerations  include:  (i)  the  relative  importance  of  the \nsector  to  the  economy,  the  weight  or  benefits  of  the  reform  program,  and  the  leverage \nnecessary to counter resistance from interest groups; (ii) the policy adjustment costs incurred by \nthe  government  and  relevant  financial  statutory  agencies  (i.e.,  SEC),  and  financial  institutions \nand  corporations  in  implementing  and  complying  with  reforms;  and  (iii)  the  development \nfinancing needs of the government. The finance sector accounts for a sizeable proportion of the \neconomy  and  its  development  and  stability  is  critical  to  support  Thailand\u2019s  economic \ntransformation, growth and poverty reduction. 7 ADB staff estimates that the complete long run \nstatic benefits of the reform program are estimated at $5.3 billion or 2.2% of GDP highlighting \nthe importance of the reform program to the economy (footnote 6). The reform program includes \nseveral politically sensitive policy and institutional reforms that have been resisted in the past, \nsuch as SET demutualization and gradual relaxation of capital controls. To support the reforms, \nthe program amount loan provides leverage to the executing agency (PDMO) and implementing \nagencies  to  support  implementation.  The  policy  adjustment  costs to  the  government,  statutory \nagencies and financial institutions are conservatively estimated at $51.8 million or alternatively \n$171.5  million  if lost  tax  revenue  flows  from  the  reforms  are  calculated  as  present  value  lump \nsums  (footnote  6).  These  include  the  administrative,  enforcement  and  fiscal  costs  to  the \ngovernment in implementing and enforcing the reforms (estimated at least $48 million or $168 \nmillion  if  foregone  tax  revenue  flows  are  calculated  as  present  value  lump  sums).  The  policy \nadjustment costs to these entities are likely to be higher if the enforcement costs incurred by the \nSEC  under  its  legislative  amendments  could  also  be  quantified.  The  policy  adjustment  costs \nalso include the increased business costs borne by financial institutions and corporations from \ncomplying with the reforms (estimated at least $3.8 million). \n \n30. \nThe  program  loan  also  reflects  the  government\u2019s  development  financing  needs.  The \nGovernment  has  targeted  a  deficit  of  4.1%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  FY2011  (about          \n$11 billion\u2013$12 billion) taking into account the need to provide a modest fiscal stimulus at this \nstage of the economic recovery and to protect critical development spending. Under the FY2010 \nand  FY2011  budgets,  the  government  is  close  to  its  legislated  debt  limits  on  domestic  debt \nfinancing but it has borrowing space under its limits on foreign debt financing  so it requested \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  to  finance  part  of  the  development  financing  gap.  ADB  has \ncoordinated with the World Bank support for a single tranche Development Policy Loan (DPL) to \nThailand in the amount of $1 billion for public financial management reforms. The World Bank is \n\n                                                 \n5 Policy Matrix and Medium-Term Direction (Appendix 4). \n6 Summary Program Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n7 Summary Poverty Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nexpected to support its DPL to its board of directors in mid-October 2010. ADB and World Bank \ncombined  financing  of  the  government  budget  amounts  to  $1.3  billion  (or  about  12  percent  of \nthe budget deficit). The remaining 88% of deficit financing will be domestically sourced.  \n \nF. \n \n31. \nThe  PDMO  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  CMDP.  The  MOF,  the  BOT,  the  SEC,  the \nDPA,  the  SMC,  and  the  Office  of  Insurance  Commission  are  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nMOF  established  the  CMDWC\u2014comprising  representatives  from  its  Fiscal  Policy  Office,  the \nBOT,  the  SEC,  the  SET,  and  market  participants\u2014to  be  responsible  for  implementing  and \nsustaining the program components. The CMDP was implemented from October 2007 to March \n2010. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans.8 The  program  will  provide  for  the  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  incurred \nup to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the withdrawal application certification.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n32. \nAn associated policy and advisory TA grant for Capital Market Development Phase III is \nproposed. This is the third of three TA projects for capital market development since 2006 that \nhave  been  designed  in  sequence  based  on  progress  in  capital  market  reforms.  The  first  TA \ncommenced  in  2006  to  support  implementation  of  the  capital  market  development  plan.  The \nsecond TA in 2008 (capital market development phase II) supported analytical and policy advice \non  capital  market  reforms.  The  third  TA  will  support  implementation  of  the  P3F  and  selected \ncomponents  of  the  master  plan.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,250,000  equivalent,  of  which \nADB will provide $900,000, to be financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nOther Sources).9  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\n \nA. \n \nFiduciary  assessment.  Thailand\u2019s  financial  management  systems  and  the  overall \n33. \nfiduciary environment of the public financial management system are deemed to be satisfactory. \nThe  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment,  the  first  of  its  kind,  is  a \ncomprehensive diagnosis covering the overall public financial management system in Thailand \nundertaken  by  the  World  Bank  in  December  2008.  The  public  financial  management  systems \nare underpinned by a strong legal and institutional framework. Accounting standards based on \ninternational  standards  are  applied,  and  financial  statements  are  prepared  on  a  modified \naccruals basis. Thailand\u2019s tax system is well established and efficiently run, and public debt is \nefficiently  managed  with  prudent  limits.  External  audit  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  is \nwide-ranging  and  performed  to  international  standards;  its  jurisdiction  covers  all  elements  of \ncentral government, state-owned enterprises, and all local authorities. \n \n34. \nAnticorruption. The government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) and Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Thailand\u2019s anti-money laundering (AML) legislation was approved in 2003, and ongoing \nefforts are enhancing the effectiveness of its AML regime. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n9   Technical Assistance \u2013 Capital Market Development Phase III (Appendix 2). \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nB. \n \n35. \nThe CMDP has a positive impact on poverty reduction through the creation of direct and \nindirect  benefits  to  poor  households  (footnote  7).  It  will  contribute  to  sustainable  reduction  in \npoverty  through  three  channels.  The  first  channel  is  through  supporting  higher  and  sustained \nlonger  term  economic  growth.  By  developing  the  domestic  bond  market,  expanding  the  stock \nmarket,  relaxing  exchange  rate  controls,  and  introducing  new  financial  sector  products, \ndomestic  financing  of  public  and  private  investments  will  increase  thereby  supporting  higher \neconomic  growth.  The  second  channel  is  through  inclusiveness  of  the  poor  in  the  modern \nfinancial sector. By developing new savings products (such as the retail savings bond) and the \nnational pension scheme and expanding its coverage to the poor, the savings rate and holdings \nof  financial  assets  of  low  income  households  will  increase  over  time. 10  Developing  the \nsecondary  mortgage  market  will  generate  financing  for  lower  cost  housing  and  benefiting  the \npoor. The CMDP and the government\u2019s Capital Market Master Plan includes planned activities \nand  programs  for  increasing  Thai  households\u2019  financial  literacy  and  awareness  of  savings \nproducts will complement these reforms. The third channel is through improving the regulatory \nframework for financial sector stability. The CMDP includes several measures for strengthening \nfinancial sector stability including enhancing the surveillance and enforcement capabilities of the \nSEC,  establishing  the  deposit  insurance  agency,  and  establishing  a  coordination  mechanism \ncomprising  the  key  financial  sector  regulators  to  better  detect  systemic  risks  to  the  domestic \nfinancial sector and more effective enforcement of financial sector regulations. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nThe  CMDP  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a  negative  impact  on \nindigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is  classified  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement, \nimpact on indigenous people, and impact on the environment.11  \n \nD. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nMacroeconomic  stability.  The  global  economy \nis  recovering  slowly  and  global  credit  markets \nremain modestly vulnerable.  \n\nfrequent  changes \n\nGovernment  stability.  This \nis  a  significant \nconstraint on development of the capital markets \nsector.  Since  2006, \nin \ngovernment  have  resulted  in  regular  ministerial \nchanges.  While  recurrent  political  turmoil  does \nnot appear to have derailed Thailand\u2019s economic \nrecovery,  it  remains  a  key  risk  to  the  country\u2019s \nlonger-term economic growth.  \nSustaining  reforms.  Reforms  being  undertaken \nby  the  government  may  draw  opposition  from \nthose with vested or competing interests. \n\nMitigating Measures \nWhile  there  is  moderate  fiscal  stress,  the  government  is \nundertaking  fiscal  consolidation  and  expects  to  return  to \nbalance  its  overall  budget  by  2015  and  achieve  surpluses \nthereafter.  The  banking  system  is  well  capitalized  and  \nnonperforming loans are low.  \nPast  and  present  governments  are  strongly  committed  to \ndevelopment of the capital market; the new government is \na  particularly  strong  supporter.  These  reforms  include  the \npassage of core legislation on conferring a greater degree \nof autonomy and accountability to the regulators of banking \nand securities markets, endorsement of the capital market \nmaster  plan  in  November  2009,  and  its  implementation  in \n2010.  \nTo mitigate or reduce resistance from vested interests, the \ngovernment  decided  on  extensive  and  broad-based \nstakeholder  consultation  and  input  into  the  formulation  of \nthe  capital  market  master  plan,  which  is  the  anchor  for \nreforms in this sector.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n                                                 \n10 Currently, low-income households savings rates are about 3% of income and only 8% of low income households \n\nreport holding financial assets more than $1500.  \n\n11 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions  underlying \n\nthe \n37. \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment \nimplementation  of  TA \nrecommendations.

The government will (a) carry out the \npolicies and actions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained \nin the policy matrix and ensure sustainability of the reforms beyond the program \nperiod, (b) carry out all of its obligations as stipulated under the loan agreement \nin  a  timely  manner,  and  (c)  ensure  that  the  agreed  actions  are  sustained  with \nrespect to each policy achievement.  \nPolicy dialogue. The borrower will keep ADB informed of, and the borrower and \nADB will from time to time exchange views on, sector issues, policy reforms, and \nadditional capital market reforms that may be considered necessary or desirable, \nincluding  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  policies  and  actions  set  out  in  the \npolicy letter and the policy matrix, P3F, and TA project. \nCounterpart  funds.  The  government  will  ensure  that  the counterpart  funds  will \nbe  used  to  support  financial  sector  reforms,  to  meet  the  financing  costs \nassociated  with  the  program  and  the  P3F,  and  the  financing  of  the  budget \nexpenditures,  notably \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n\nthe  stimulus  package \n\nfocused  on \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Thailand  for  the  Capital  Market  Development  Program  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank-offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n30 August 2010 \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2009.
