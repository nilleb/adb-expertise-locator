Target \nsectors are consumer, finance, health care and pharmaceuticals, and technology.  \n \nRationale for proposed ADB assistance. India is currently the world\u2019s seventh-largest \n3. \neconomy and its economy grew at an average of 7% annually since 2008. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) forecasts growth of 7.3% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2019.3 The rapid economic growth is \nexpanding  India\u2019s  middle  class  and  increasing  disposable  incomes,  which  is  in  turn  driving \ndiscretionary  consumption-led  opportunities  across  several  sectors,  including  finance,  health \ncare, and consumer services.4 Growth in these sectors is being driven by (i) a substantial increase \nin discretionary spending; (ii) the rise of tier 2 cities and rural towns, which will be India\u2019s next \ngrowth engines; and (iii) favorable demographics, with approximately 60% of the population in the \nworking age bracket. Companies in these sectors require capital for expansion to enable them to \nmeet the needs of India\u2019s growing middle class. \n \n4. \nIndia has undergone a series of macro reforms since the general elections of 2014. Newly \nenacted policies are expected to enhance the transparency and efficiency of India\u2019s economy, \nfostering an improved business environment for private companies, and a favorable investment \nclimate for institutional investors.5 Given this context, ADB\u2019s investment in Multiples Private Equity \nFund III Limited will help (i) provide adequate capital to private sector companies and catalyze \ntheir  development  while  tapping  into  India\u2019s  growing  middle  class,  (ii)  support  the  Indian \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  the transparency  and  efficiency  of the  economy  by  improving \ncorporate governance of portfolio companies, and (iii) contribute to private sector job creation and \nincreased tax revenues for the Government of India. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\n \nInvestment Identification and Description \n\nA. \n \n5. \nDescription.  Multiples  Alternate  Asset  Management  Private  Limited  (Multiples)  is  an \nIndia-focused, independent, and well-respected private equity fund manager. Founder and chief \nexecutive  officer  (CEO)  Renuka  Ramnath,  a  seasoned  private  equity  investment  professional, \nestablished  Multiples  in 2009.  Prior  to forming  Multiples,  Ramnath  was managing  director  and \n\n \n\n1   The fund size may increase to $1.15 billion if the board of the feeder fund exercises an option to do so, and if co-\n\ninvestments are included within the feeder fund.  \n\n2  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n3  ADB. 2018. Asian Development Outlook 2018 Update: Maintaining Stability Amid Heightened Uncertainty. Manila. \n4   Bain & Company. 2017. India Private Equity Report 2017 indicates the services sector experienced particularly strong \ngrowth, and its contribution to gross domestic product increased to 54%. Financial services, insurance, real estate \nand professional services grew at around 10%, leading overall growth in the sector. \n\n5   New  policies  include  initiatives,  policies,  and  legal  changes  such  as  Make  In  India  initiative  (September  2014), \namendments  in  Foreign  Exchange  Management  Act  (December  2015),  Startup  India  initiative  (January  2016), \nDemonetization (November 2016), and Goods and Services Tax Act (July 2017). \n\n\f2  \n \n\n \n\nCEO of ICICI Venture, one of India\u2019s earliest alternative asset managers, where she managed \nmore than $2 billion in private equity, mezzanine, and real estate assets.6 [This information has \nbeen removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, \npara. 17.2.(v)].7 Multiples has a 14-member investment team based in Mumbai, India.  \n \n6. \nMultiples is currently raising its third private equity fund, Multiples Private Equity Fund III, \nwhich is established as an investment trust registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of \nIndia as a category 2 alternative investment fund (AIF) vehicle, with a target capitalization of $750 \nmillion (footnote 1). Multiples Equity Fund Trustee Private Limited, incorporated in India, is the \ntrustee of the fund. The trustee has appointed Multiples Alternate Asset  Management Limited \n(Multiples),  a  company  incorporated  in  India, to act  as the fund  manager  under  an  investment \nmanagement agreement.8  \n \n7. \nInvestment  identification.  In  the  process  of  market  mapping  India\u2019s  private  equity \nlandscape,  ADB  met  with  over  35  Indian  fund  managers  that  provide  growth  equity  capital  to \nsmall-  to  middle-market  companies.  ADB  shortlisted  five  of  these  fund  managers\u2014including \nMultiples\u2014as potential partners, based on their alignment with ADB\u2019s private equity investment \nguidelines, including performance track record, access to deal flow, and operational expertise. \n \n8. \nADB first met the Multiples team in February 2015 and since then has actively tracked the \nplatform through  regular  interactions  with  Ramnath  and  her team.  These  meetings,  as  well  as \ndiscussions with existing limited partners, confirmed that Ramnath has developed Multiples into \na  high-quality  institutional  platform,  as  reflected  by  its  proprietary  investment  frameworks  to \nensure consistency in process, a collaborative culture that emphasizes a cohesive approach to \ndeal evaluation, and governance and reporting standards in line with global best practices. ADB \nwas also attracted to Multiples\u2019 investment approach of identifying and partnering with best-in-\nclass  companies  across  sectors  through  both  minority  and  control,  and  occasionally  listed \ninvestments.  These  targeted  companies  are  established  businesses,  although  Multiples  also \nselectively  invests  in  early-stage  opportunities  where  valuations  and  growth  prospects  are \nattractive. In all cases, however, Multiples positions itself as a long-term partner to entrepreneurs \nthat  helps  investee  companies  become  industry-leading  businesses  and  create  value  for \nshareholders.  The  proposed  investment  would  allow  ADB  to  contribute  to  India\u2019s  continued \neconomic  growth  through  an  established  private  equity  platform  that  invests  in  sectors  closely \naligned with ADB\u2019s developmental mandate, including financial services and health care. \n \nB. \n \nThe fund aims to make 11\u221214 investments of $20 million to $80 million each. The fund \n9. \nmay  also  consider  transactions  above  $100  million,  for  which  co-investment  capital  will  be \nrequired. The fund\u2019s targeted sectors are consumer, finance, health care and pharmaceuticals, \nand technology. The fund will primarily invest in minority growth opportunities but has the flexibility \nto  opportunistically  pursue  control-oriented  and/or  early-stage  investments,  as  well  as  private \ninvestments in public companies. \n  \n10.

Multiples positions itself as a patient investor in these \ncompanies and guides their promoters in developing systems and processes to enable them to \nincrease profitability while maintaining high standards of corporate governance. Lastly, given the \ncurrent stress in the Indian banking system and tightening of asset regulations by India\u2019s central \nbank,  Multiples  has  the experience  and  expertise  to facilitate  a  company  turnaround,  although \nsuch investments will be made selectively. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nIntegrity  disclosure.

The  anticipated  exit  strategies for  the  fund\u2019s \ninvestments  include  public  offerings,  trade  sales  of  portfolio  companies  to  local  and  foreign \nstrategic buyers, and secondary sales to other private equity funds.  \n \n23. \nReporting  arrangements.  Multiples  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  reports;  and  (ii) \naudited annual financial statements, an annual valuation, an overview of the portfolio with brief \ninformation  on  each  portfolio  company\u2019s  performance  and  valuation,  an  annual  development \neffectiveness monitoring report, and an annual environmental and social monitoring report.

ADB\u2019s participation as a first close investor will, therefore, help anchor the \nfund and attract additional institutional capital to enable the fund to reach its target size. ADB\u2019s \ncommitment  to  the  fund  will  allow  Multiples  to  achieve  a  diversified,  well-balanced  institutional \ninvestor  base  for  the  fund.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  provide  validation  of  the  fund\u2019s \nstrategy, and its commercial and developmental attributes. \n \n26. \nRaising standards. Multiples will be required to implement an ESMS acceptable to ADB \nthat  requires  it  to  oblige  its  portfolio  companies  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  environment  and  social \nsafeguard requirements and report to ADB on development indicators. \n \n27. \nGender  equality.

The equity investment is aligned with the following impact: private equity funding \nfor  middle-market  companies  in  India  increased,  contributing  to  the  growth  of  the  economy, \ncreation of quality jobs, and improvement of business efficiency and transparency. \n \n37. \nsustainability of private equity investments in India demonstrated. \n \n38. \nOutputs.

The proposed investment in the fund aligns strongly \nwith  operational  priorities  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030. 18  These  include  (i)  addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities by generating quality jobs and achieving better health \nfor all, and (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality by scaling up support for gender equality. \nStrategy 2030 also supports expanding private sector operations, including using private equity \nto  extend  reach  and  diversify  into  other  sectors;  supporting  greater  financial  inclusion;  and \nstrengthening the finance sector and capital markets. Given its track record, Multiples is uniquely \npositioned to deliver on the Strategy 2030 themes through investments such as RBL Bank and \nVastu  Housing  that  promote  financial  inclusion  and  access  to  affordable  housing,  and  Vikram \nHospital and Natco Pharma that deliver high-quality health care products and services. \n \nConsistency with country strategy. The investment in the fund is consistent with the \n40. \ncountry partnership strategy, 2018\u22122022 for India; it (i) highlights the need for recapitalization of \nthe banking subsector to resolve its stressed assets; (ii) includes support for affordable housing, \nfinancial  inclusion  and  the  health  sectors  as  strategic  priorities;  and  (iii)  focusses  on  the \nimportance of gender equality.19  \n \n41. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations.
