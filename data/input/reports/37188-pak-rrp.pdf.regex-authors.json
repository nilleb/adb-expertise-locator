An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nAssessment  covering the main subprojects, and an environmental assessment \nand review procedure report was also completed.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  aims  to  reduce  poverty  for  the  inhabitants  of  the \ncoastal zone of Thatta and Badin districts in Sindh Province. The \nproject strategy is to help these households sustainably increase \ntheir incomes, their access to public services, and their capacity to \nmanage the natural resource base on which they live.  \n \nAt  the  household  level,  demand-driven  skills  training,  links  to \nmicrofinance  services,  and  improved  coastal  resource \ndevelopment  (mangrove  planting,  crab  and  prawn  ponds,  and \nbivalve and seaweed rafts) will create income-generating options. \nAt the community level, group organization, leadership training, \ndemand-driven community-led civil works and related initiatives, \nand direct participation in the sustainable management of coastal \nnatural  resources  will  support  social  capital  development  and \nbetter  public  service  access.  This  will  establish  the  enabling \nconditions for continuing community-driven development. At the \ninstitutional level, creation of a coastal zone management and \nmonitoring  plan,  capacity  development  of  the  Coastal \nDevelopment Authority (CDA), a fisheries and water quality survey \nof near-coastal waterways, and targeted capacity development of \nthe districts will enhance public sector responsiveness to local \nneeds. Involvement of strong national and local nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  as  well  as  local  governments  will  help \nbeneficiaries better understand, engage with, and build long-term \nrelationships with the institutions they depend on for services and \nsupport.    \n   \nRationale  Sindh has a coastline of approximately 350 kilometers, a major \nportion of which comprises the Indus River Delta. Significantly \nreduced flows in the lower Indus due to a long period of river \nwater extraction upstream have reduced the availability of water \n ", "iv   \nfrom the Kotri barrage and increased tidal seawater intrusion in \nthe lower reaches of the river. These conditions have resulted in a \nhigh  level  of  environmental  degradation,  consisting  of  tidal \nsaltwater intrusion, significant loss of agricultural land production, \ndecline in the mangrove habitat, erosion along tidal creeks, and \nloss of inshore fish stocks. While inter-provincial water sharing \nagreements are a long-term issue requiring significant national \nattention to resolve, the effects on the downstream areas need \nimmediate attention. \n \nThe center of the highly fragile and rapidly changing ecosystem is \nthe coastal areas of Thatta and Badin districts, consisting of eight \ntalukas (subdistricts) with a population of 1.2 million. Poverty is a \nserious issue in rural Sindh, with 79% of the people in the project \narea living in under the poverty line. In addition to lack of income \nopportunities and poor access to Government services, coastal \nhouseholds  have  to  deal  with  rapidly  declining  environmental \nconditions.  \n \nThe  downward  spiral  of  environmental  change,  with  a  parallel \nincrease  in  poverty,  isolation  and  powerlessness  under  usual \nhousehold resource management conditions, is the fundamental \nissue in the project area. Poverty is worsening at an alarming rate, \nas salt water intrusion weakens traditional land-based livelihoods. \nWith  declining  options  on  the  land,  people  increasingly  are \nexploiting coastal resources which already have been seriously \naffected by the changes in the Indus Delta.  \n \nAs recognized in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the slow \nprogress in reducing rural poverty clearly indicates the need to \ncontinue focusing on poverty interventions. The national priority to \nprotect  the  vulnerable  and  improve  their  livelihoods\u2014and  the \n\u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d that Sindh\u2019s coastal rural poor face\u2014are the \nreasons why the Project is appropriate and timely. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The overall project impact is a reduction in poverty for households \nin  Sindh  Province.  The  outcomes  are  improved,  ecologically \nsustainable income opportunities and access to services for poor \nresidents in the eight coastal talukas of Thatta and Badin districts. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $40.1 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.76 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR24,237,000 ($36.0 \nmillion equivalent) will be provided from the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Special Fund to help finance the Project. The loan \nwill be for 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \nannual interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \nLoan Agreement. \n   \n ", "v \n \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the \nTerms  government of Sindh on the same terms and conditions as those \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  GoS  shall  make  the \nentire proceeds of the Loan available to CDA on a grant basis. \nThe Government of Sindh will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2013  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \nImplementation  The project steering committee, with the same membership as the \nArrangements  project preparatory technical assistance oversight committee, will \n(i)  ensure  high-level  interagency  coordination  and  cooperation, \n(ii) provide policy guidance and reform support, and (iii)  facilitate \nproject  implementation.  The  Project  will  establish  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) within the CDA, Karachi, headed by a \nproject director who will be supported by appropriate technical and \nsupport staff. The PMU will be responsible for overall interagency \ncoordination,  project  procurement  and  financial  management, \nreporting, and monitoring and evaluation of project outputs and \nresults. Two district project implementation units will be based at \nBadin  and  Thatta  for  field-level  coordination  and  facilitation  of \nimplementation,  including  environmental  and  other  safeguards, \nproject-related capacity building for district governments and local \nNGOs, and monitoring of gender and other social concerns.    \n   \nExecuting Agency  Coastal Development Authority \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of $32.0 million of goods, related services, and civil \nworks, including $18.1 million of community-driven small initiatives \nand medium-scale infrastructure, will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  250  person-months  of  specialized \nservices  of  national  consultants  and  23  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services.  Long-term  and  short-term \nappointments will be made through consulting firms and individual \nconsultant contracts. The community organization and small-scale \ninitiatives contracts provide an additional 3,024 person-months of \nprofessional  field  staff.  Project  management  and  project \nimplementation staff will provide 2,208 person-months of services.  \nQuality-  and  cost-based  selection,  single-source  selection  with \nmixed  input  and  performance  basis,  fixed-cost  selection,  and \nconsultant-qualification  selection  methods  will  be  used.  \nConsultant selection will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). \n   \n ", "vi   \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will provide direct social capital development, poverty-\nBeneficiaries  reduction  mechanisms,  improved  access  to  government  and \nNGO-based  services,  and  improved  institutional  capacity  to \nsustain such services in a natural resource management context \nfor an estimated 58,000 households. The poverty impact ratio, a \nmeans  of  estimating  the  poor  as  a  proportion  of  all  project \nbeneficiaries, is 59.9%. The base case economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  for  the  Project,  which  assumes  the  community \ndevelopment component is a pure cost, is estimated to be 16% (a \nnet  present  value  of  PRs71.9  million,  or  $1.2  million  at  12% \ndiscount  rate).  This  EIRR  is  considered  within  an  acceptable \nrange. For the community-managed initiatives, the link road EIRR \nis 15.38%. Project investment in mangrove planting, crab ponds, \nand shrimp ponds yields EIRRs of 27.5%, 28.3%, and 24.8%, \nrespectively.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  Project  is \nrobust with regard to changes in costs and benefits.  \n \nAt  the  institutional  level,  CDA,  provincial  departments,  district \ngovernments, and NGOs will better understand, engage with, and \nbuild  long-term  relationships  with  local  communities.  The \ncommunities will (i) increase their social capital and leadership, \n(ii) improve  their  access  to  government  services  by  increasing \nknowledge and group leverage, (iii) improve self-confidence and \nmutual  support,  and  (iv)  increase  effective  community \nmanagement of coastal natural resources. All area households \nwill have increased access to potable water, schools and clinics, \nflood safety areas, and other services on demand, as well as \naccess  to  microfinance  services.  Participating  households  will \nhave better income-earning options and higher incomes. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Project risks include cyclone and storm surges, declining fresh \nwater  discharge  to  the  Indus  River  Delta,  institutional \ndisengagement,  sustainability  of  community  organizations,  and \ninadequate  funding  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nfacilities constructed under the project. To mitigate these risks, the \nProject  will  (i)  undertake  preconstruction  safeguard  reviews  to \naddress disaster risk before confirming construction, as well as \npromote the construction of safety areas in the most vulnerable \nlocations; (ii) facilitate the population\u2019s continuing adjustment to an \nenvironment with much less fresh water; (iii) ensure the resources \nand roles of all parties implementing aspects of the Project are \nclearly delineated and agreed upon, and establish three tiers of \ncontinuing dialogue at the level of district project implementation \nunits, PMU, and project steering committee; (iv) designate as key \ncommunity  development  contractor  the  National  Rural  Support \nProgramme, a national NGO with an endowment fund that can \nhelp extend community empowerment benefits beyond the project \nlife; and (v) have communities provide up-front funds for O&M on \nsmall-scale  schemes,  and  ensure  that  O&M  for  medium-scale \ninitiatives will be sustained through district Government budgets. \n ", "(cid:54)(cid:56)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:8217)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Coastal Community Development Project (the \nProject).1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Although Pakistan has increased spending on social services and poverty reduction to \nalmost 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) as of 2006, poverty continues to be a significant \nconcern. The national poverty analysis2 shows that 32.1% of the population and 40.2% of \npeople in rural areas live in poverty. An additional 20.4% of the people are just above the \npoverty line, leaving them vulnerable to household, environmental, or economic shocks that \neasily could push them back into poverty. Typically, the poor have low educational levels and \nlack access to services, such as fresh water, transport, education, and health. Household \nisolation, which is accompanied by few income options, poor public service provision, and \nvulnerability to natural disasters, reinforces poverty and hopelessness for rural households, \nparticularly in the project area. Women are uniquely vulnerable as they have one of the lowest \nliteracy rates in Asia and lower access to paid work than men due to social restrictions.   \n  \n3.  The average per capita income in Sindh Province is about $450 per year. Standards of \nliving for the urban educated population are significantly higher than for their rural counterparts, \nwith the highest poverty level for the country in rural Sindh (52%) and the lowest in urban Sindh \n(23%). About two-thirds of rural households live on less than $1 a day. Drought is common in \nSindh, affecting the population dependent on non-irrigated lands in particular.  \n \n4.  The eight coastal talukas (subdistricts) of Thatta and Badin Districts have 48 unions, \n2,008 villages (of which 718 are registered with the Board of Revenue), and a population of 1.2 \nmillion  people  in  175,000  households.  Although  formal  poverty  profiling  has  not  been \nundertaken  in  the  area,  secondary  data  generated  by  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA)3 showed that 54% are in the poorest category and 79% are characterized as \npoor. In a 2004 national survey Pakistan\u2019s poorest district was Thatta, with Badin not far \nbehind.4    \n \n5.  Most of the coastal population of Thatta and Badin live in rural areas, with the vast \nmajority traditionally depending on agriculture and fisheries as their main livelihood. Other \nsources of income include basket and mat making, sales of bamboo and fodder collected in \ncoastal open lands, net making, embroidery, small livestock rearing, and sales of labor. A \nsignificant proportion of the people in villages in the mangrove swamps and mudflats at the \nsea\u2019s edge in the coastal areas depend completely on capture fisheries for their income.  \n                                                 \n1  This  project  was  transferred  from  Agriculture,  Environment,  and  Natural  Resources  Division,  South  Asia \nDepartment to Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources, Central and West Asia Department on 8 June \n2006.

Poverty in coastal Sindh is caused by household isolation\u2014from information (about \nmarkets, rights, and options for change); from economic opportunities; from communities; and \nfrom public services, including disaster protection. This isolation continues despite the area\u2019s \nproximity to the megacity of Karachi, which is only 3 hours drive away by good road. Information \nflows are poor in areas where few can read or own radios, where institutional interactions with \nlocal  people  are  uncommon,  and  where  historic  socioeconomic  connections  are  weak. \nDistances between villages are long, infrastructure poor, and few community groups are active.  \n  \n7.  The isolation of poor coastal households from opportunities for change is an urgent and \nimportant issue. The solution is to focus on community, informational, and institutional links that \nwould enable households to protect and sustain the natural resource base, while benefiting from \na wider variety of income-generating options. To deepen and stabilize household benefits, and \nmake poverty reduction permanent, the government of Sindh (GoS) recognizes the importance \nof providing poor villagers with essential public services. GoS also understands the importance \nof  creating  mechanisms  for  the  community  and  government  to  interact  effectively  with \nnongovernment organizations (NGO) to improve household and village conditions.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  Socioeconomic Isolation and Gender Restrictions. As much as 90% of households \nin the project area live in reed shacks known as katchi abadis (one-room village house made of \nreed mats, no fixtures) with no cooking or sanitation facilities and no real protection from the \nelements. The coastal populations are a long way from medical facilities, and the pervasive \nshortage of clean water adds to their health issues. The average literacy rate for men is 47% \nand women 14%, and most children do not attend school. The coastal areas have a traditional, \ngender-based  division  of  labor.  Despite  their  significant  contribution,  women  have  weak \nbargaining positions in the household and little involvement in local resource management. \nThey essentially are excluded from decision making at the household and community levels. \nPhysical isolation due to the distances between roads and villages contributes to a sense of \ndisempowerment for both men and women.  \n \n9.  Communities  are  used  to  generating  a  certain  level  of  income  from  activities  they \nundertake in their immediate surroundings. As the resources needed for these activities erode \nor disappear, poor households use the remaining resources even more intensively because \nthey have few other options. As a result, the weakening of the fragile ecosystem accelerates, \nreducing income opportunities for households, increasing risks of loss of food and health, and \ncreating a sense of vulnerability and despair. The lack of sufficient government services adds to \nthe sense of hopelessness. Changing these circumstances requires help. Communities and \nhouseholds need to alter their income and living paradigm\u2014from one of isolated households to \none of community groups that directly face their circumstances and actively manage interactions \nwith  their  physical  and  institutional  environment  to  enable  improved  livelihoods  and \nsustainability. A summary of the poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  Institutional Constraints. Government\u2019s role is to plan, deliver, and provide upkeep for \nbasic services, such as (i) physical infrastructure (roads, water supplies, power), (ii) social \nsupports (health, education, welfare services), and (iii) information for joint public resources \n(government land, fisheries, forest, agriculture, and livestock). Households in the coastal zone \nhave  not  received  effective  GoS  and  district  support,  as  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring  capacity  is  insufficient  to  facilitate  appropriate  service  provision.  The  Coastal \nDevelopment Authority (CDA), which has a clear mandate to plan, facilitate implementation of \nand monitor all development of the coastal zone, is poised to fill this gap. Coastal area NGOs \nprovide social services and draw attention to rights issues. However, their capacity is weak, \n ", "          3\nparticularly in project planning, implementation, and financial management. The development of \na coastal zone management plan, as well as the capacity of all players to implement the plan, is \nessential for sustainable development in the area. \n \n11.  Water. A variety of anthropogenic and natural pressures have degraded Sindh\u2019s 350-\nkilometer (km) arid coast significantly over the past 50 years. The main causes have been \nsubstantial reductions of Indus River discharges into the delta, increasing salinity resulting from \npoor drainage, and seawater intrusion. These changes have reduced the natural resource base, \nwith the most significant impacts being on (i) the availability of fresh water for drinking and \nagriculture, (ii) mangrove forest coverage, (iii) fisheries production, and (iv) agricultural output. \nThe significant and measurable declines in these areas have harmed the coastal environment \nand the vulnerable coastal communities. Availability of fresh water has become the critical \nissue, negatively affecting the productive use of human time, health, population distribution, and \nchoice and productivity of crops and livestock. The sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  Mangrove Forests. Mangrove forests and their environmental functions are extremely \nimportant to the delta and coastal ecosystems, providing nursery habitats for fish, shrimp, crabs, \nand mollusks, sustainable supplies of fuel wood and fodder, and vital protection against coastal \nand tidal erosion and storms. Since 1997 however 72% of the 263,000 hectares (ha) have been \nlost to (i) over-harvesting of mangrove trees for fuel wood, fodder, and timber; (ii) grazing by \ncamels and, to a lesser extent, by goats; (iii) major alterations in the fresh water and seawater \ndynamics of the lower Indus Delta, including its maritime near-shore components; (iv) reduced \nsediment loads and associated nutrients in the lower Indus River; (v) encroachment and some \nindustrial pollution in Karachi District; and (vi) failure to enforce forestry regulations. Sustainable \nregeneration of mangrove forests at key sites under community management is central to the \nfuture sustainability of the coastal zone and its rural communities in Sindh, and potentially also \nto the more distant communities in the Indus River catchment area. \n \n13.  Fisheries. The fresh water and marine fishery resources of the onshore and near-shore \nIndus  Delta  represent  over  70%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  fisheries  industry  and  employ  and  feed  a \nsubstantial number of coastal Sindh households. In 2005 the total catch of fish and shellfish in \nPakistan exceeded 665,000 metric tons and had an export value of $129 million. While the \nexport of shrimp from the Sindh coastal area generated about $100 million in 1994, the value \nhas declined to less than $40 million per year in 2005. In addition to shrinking shrimp exports, \nthe overall fish catch from the Arabian Sea appears to be declining. Uncontrolled foreign fishing \nvessels and the contract fishing system are adversely affecting the resources on which the \nfishery depends. The catch is not managed to produce a sustainable yield and its value is not \nmaximized. The root problem is that the responsible institutions do not have the data or capacity \nto manage the resource properly. Further, mariculture options have not been explored.  \n \n14.  Agriculture and Land Base. Large landholders own 70% of the remaining arable land \nin coastal Sindh. Under crop-share agreements with haris (tenant farmers), bananas, onions, \npan leaves, rice, sugarcane, sunflower, tomatoes, wheat, and a range of minor crops are \ncultivated on this land, with low yields per ha but reasonable yields per worker. In fiscal year \n2005 the value of the major crops produced was approximately PRs1.2 billion. Poor households \nare largely laborers on these lands. Such households also make use of uncultivated areas for \ncollection of fodder, bamboo, reeds, and other plants. When possible, poor households acquire \nlivestock as a method of savings and income generation. As land pressure increases and \nagricultural  land  access  declines  labor  demand  also  drops,  cutting  off  a  major  source  of \nhousehold income. Pressure on uncultivated lands also increases, with consequent negative \nimpacts on income-generating activities, land cover, and livestock options. \n \n ", "4   \n15.  Lessons.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  record  of  achievements  in  rural \ndevelopment  projects  is  mixed.  Evaluation  studies  from  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment  (OED)5  and  other  ADB  implementation  experiences6  were  reviewed  for  useful \nlessons. Under a 2004 TA7 a detailed assessment of four rural development projects in Pakistan \nthat began in 1990 was undertaken and these recommendations were also incorporated. Finally \na sector synthesis of fisheries carried out by OED in 1998 as well as findings from the previous \nfive fisheries projects in Pakistan was reviewed. The most fundamental lesson was that projects \nneed to be simple to be effective. The Project reflects this finding. \n \n16.  The project design incorporates the following lessons: \n(i)  compact physical location for multiple inputs;  \n(ii)  measures to improve the usual 2.4-year delay in startup, including methods for rapid \nsetup of the project management unit (PMU) and NGO contracting;  \n(iii)  identification and use of institutions with the built-in capacity to provide needed \nservices to beneficiaries, as well as sufficient local knowledge to ensure locally \nsuitable methods for natural resource management and community organization;  \n(iv)  enabling communities to express needs and have them met in sustainable ways;  \n(v)  local-level  coalition  building  of  district  and  provincial  government  offices,  NGO \nservice providers, microfinance institutions, and sustainable community groups;  \n(vi)  flexibility in design for pilot work in fisheries, ensuring that beneficiaries drive the \nexpansion processes;  \n(vii)  establishment of reliable fisheries resources statistics;  \n(viii)  balance  of  civil  works  construction  with  effective  social  mobilization,  with \nbeneficiaries given significant control over budgets, plans, and implementation;  \n(ix)  work to strengthen local institutional capacity, particularly for districts; and  \n(x)  results-based targets and rewards systems for NGOs and government institutions, \nwith effective monitoring and evaluation. \n \n17.  Government\u2019s Strategy. The Government\u2019s program to address rural poverty is set out \nin the national Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of January 2004, and the Sindh \nprovincial PRSP of December 2003. The Sindh PRSP recognizes that the lower districts of the \nprovince have been particularly affected by disasters (cyclones) and natural phenomena (salt \nwater intrusion). Further, it observes that the economy has been constrained and the incidence \nof poverty has increased in these areas. The Sindh PRSP calls for special focus on these \ndistricts, including the coastal areas, with five broad strategies to reduce poverty: (i) fiscal and \nfinancial  management  reforms,  (ii)  improved  governance  of  civil  service  and  public  sector \ndelivery, (iii) promotion of private sector development and economic revival, (iv) development of \nwomen and children, and (v) addressing vulnerability to shocks.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Pakistan was updated in \nAugust 2005. The CSP supports poverty reduction in Pakistan through initiatives in three areas: \nsupport for good governance (devolution, legal, judicial, and police reforms, as well as sector-\nand province-based reforms), sustainable pro-poor growth (rural development and employment \ngeneration), and inclusive social development (health, education, water supply and sanitation, \nand  social  protection).  In  addition,  sub-regional  development,  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement,  and  gender  and  development  were  identified  as  crosscutting  themes.  The \nupdated CSP identifies the proposed Project as an important component of ADB\u2019s support. \nOther external assistance related to the Project is in Appendix 4. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n19.  The overall project impact is a reduction in poverty for households in Sindh Province. \nThe  outcomes  are  improved,  ecologically  sustainable  income  opportunities,  and  access  to \nservices for poor residents in the eight coastal talukas8 of Thatta and Badin districts.  \nB.   Outputs \n20.   The  outputs  include  (i)  an  environmentally  sound  coastal  zone  medium-term \nsocioeconomic  development,  management,  and  conservation  plan  implemented  by  CDA; \n(ii) effective community-driven mechanisms for community planning and increasing household \nincomes; (iii) transparent and accountable community-driven mechanisms for small-scale civil \nworks and public services delivery; (iv) sustainable community-managed income-generating \nmangrove stands, crab and prawn ponds, and bivalve rafts; and (v) an operational project \nmanagement system.   \n21.  The proposed Project has four components: (i) institutional strengthening, (ii) community \ndevelopment, (iii) improved coastal management, and (iv) project management. \n1.  Institutional Strengthening \n22.  CDA Capacity Building. Under this subcomponent, the Project will help CDA develop a \ncomprehensive  coastal  development  plan  that  effectively  addresses  environmental,  social \ndevelopment,  economic,  and  other  concerns.  CDA  will  engage  the  GoS  and  districts, \ncommunity  groups  and  village  organizations  of  the  coastal  zone,  businesses,  and  other \nstakeholders  in  the  process.  It  will  start  with  a  framework  under  which  the  plan  will  be \ndeveloped. The Project will enhance the capacity of CDA to implement its mandate through \nteam building of an expanded CDA staff, provision of geographic information system (GIS) \nfacilities, and support for appropriate leadership and cross-institutional collaboration. CDA will \nselect appropriate leadership workshops for its senior staff, with training provided in Asia where \nsuitable.   \n23.  Area  Fisheries  and  Water  Quality  Survey  and  District  Capacity  Building.  The \nsecond subcomponent is a survey of coastal fresh water and brackish water fisheries and water \nquality. It will be linked to a major national near-shore and offshore fishery survey along the \ncoast  of  Sindh  and  Balochistan  funded  by  the  Government  of  Norway.  Sindh  Provincial \nLivestock and Fisheries Department (SLFD) will implement the project survey over 3 years in \ncooperation with district fisheries divisions, and in consultation with other government and \nuniversity organizations. In the first year, the survey will be designed and tested, following \ndiscussions to ensure integration with the national marine fisheries survey. In the second year, \nthe survey will be conducted at least twice, once before the monsoon period and once after \n                                                 \n8 The project area talukas are (i) Ghorabari, Jati, Keti Bander, Kharo Chan, Mirpur Sakhro, and Shah \nBander in Thatta District; and (ii) Badin and SF Rahu (Golarchi) in Badin District. \n ", "6   \nmonsoon period. The results will be statistically analyzed during the third year. As part of the \nsurvey process, SLFD will mobilize and train local communities in basic fisheries regulation and \nmanagement.  To facilitate devolution of skills and services in fisheries from province to district, \nconsultants will complete a training needs analysis of the project area district fisheries officers \nand provide a series of trainings with SLFD to upgrade skills and improve extension capacity of \ndistrict fisheries officers. \n2.  Community Development \n24.  Community Organization and Income Enhancement. This subcomponent will provide \nfor (i) the formation of at least 1,388 community organizations in no less than 700 villages, \n(ii) participatory planning and assessment of household and community needs, (iii) training of \nhouseholds  in  income-generating  options  and  leadership,  (iv)  microsavings  and  links  to \nmicrocredit, and (v) graduation of groups to community citizen boards. The National Rural \nSupport  Programme  (NRSP)  will  conduct  all  community  organization  work,  starting  with  a \nreview of its existing program and improvements to meet the specific conditions of the coastal \ntalukas.  This  will  be  consolidated  in  an  operational  manual  that  lays  out  the  project \nimplementation mechanisms, and a field guide that presents the tools and mechanisms to be \nused in the social mobilization process and small-scale initiatives (para. 28). Both documents \nwill be updated at least annually. \n25.  NRSP will introduce the concept of community organizations as village-based entities for \nhousehold and community economic and social development. Village selection will be based on \npoverty levels, interest and willingness of poor households to engage in the activities of the \nProject,  and  physical  proximity  to  the  coast,  to  other  interested  villages,  and  to  proposed \nmangrove and prawn and crab pond working areas. Villagers will be encouraged to form groups \nof men or women with an average of 15 members, decide on a set of leaders, and start saving \nsmall amounts that are self-determined for each household. Leaders will be trained in advocacy, \nrecordkeeping  and  bank  account  operations,  and  economic  options.  The  savings  will  be \ndeposited into a bank account and fully accounted for to members. NRSP social organizers \n(both female if recruitment is possible; one male and one female, if not) will work with villagers \nto  complete  poverty  self-analyses,  resource  mapping  including  household  counts,  and  an \nongoing reflection and planning process to identify, prioritize, undertake, and monitor household \nand community income-generation and public service improvement activities.  \n26.  Services provided to community organization members and their households will include \n(i) training on a demand basis in income generation options, environmental management, and \nleadership  and  advocacy;  (ii)  access  to  microcredit  for  members,  as  well  as  support  to \ncommunity organizations to interlend their savings; (iii) links between community organizations \nthat enable them to form village organizations for economic development purposes; and (iv) \nconnections  between  village  organizations  and  local  government  to  access  government \nresources. NRSP also may help community organizations consider and address longer-term \nrights issues, such as fisheries licensing and personal identity cards.  \n27.  NRSP will provide links between community organizations and four agencies for project \nactivities. First, it will facilitate connections between community organizations and the SFWD to \nenable  community  engagement  in  the  planting  and  management  of  mangrove  plantations. \nSecond, NRSP will facilitate links with the SLFD for villager training in aquaculture; and for \ncommunity management of shared fisheries resource areas, such as creeks and inland seas, as \nwell as engagement in the coastal fresh and brackish water and water quality survey. Third, \nNRSP and local NGOs will facilitate links with districts for access to medium-scale infrastructure \n(para. 31). Fourth, NRSP will link community activities to CDA coastal planning, implementation, \nand monitoring arrangements under the coastal zone development plan. \n ", "          7\n28.  Small-Scale Community-Managed Initiatives. The Project will finance initiatives in 700 \nvillages based on community demands, with an open menu of social and economic activities \nincluding small-scale rural service infrastructure and capacity building. Funding (PRs700,000 \nper village) will be allocated through grants, allowing community organizations in the village to \nprioritize  one  or  more  initiatives  within  this  budget.  The  budget  will  be  disclosed  to  the \ncommunities at the outset of the planning cycle. A short negative list will be provided to villages, \nwhich will include social functions and environmentally damaging activities. NRSP will manage \nthe funds and the process, drawing on its experience completing more than 600 small civil \nworks projects within the project districts.  \n29.  Based on the budget, the community organizations with support from NRSP will develop \na village plan, which will include detailed project proposals. The community organizations then \nwill submit the plan with the supporting proposals to the village for endorsement through a \ncommunity meeting facilitated by NRSP. The community schemes will be prioritized based on \ntwo main criteria. First the scheme must have (i) the potential to accommodate practical and \nstrategic  gender  needs  of  women  and  girls;  (ii)  the  potential  to  benefit  the  poorer  and \ndisadvantaged sections of the community; (iii) the ability to demonstrate sustainable medium- \nand longer-term impact on the reduction of existing poverty and social inequality; and (iv) not \nhave the potential of adverse environmental impact. Second, the community organizations must \nprovide counterpart funds totaling at least 5% of the scheme cost, of which 3% must be in cash \nto be set aside for operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n30.  NRSP will carry out feasibility studies on social, technical, financial, and environmental \naspects of the proposed initiatives based on the operations manual and field guide. Social \norganizers will work with community organizations to make sure villagers have the requisite \nskills to implement and maintain each project. The district project implementation units (DPIU) \nwill ensure that the proposals do not overlap with projects already planned and in the pipeline by \nthe local governments. NRSP then will advise the communities that they can proceed with an \napproved project, and provide funds in two or more tranches. The communities will undertake \nphysical  implementation  with  NRSP  supervision  and  support  from  qualified  technicians  for \nfinancial and environmental monitoring and management. Project books in the village, which will \nbe made publicly available, will record all aspects of the scheme design, construction, and \npayment. NRSP will provide documentation on each small-scale village initiative suitable to ADB \nfor  loan  withdrawal  purposes,  inclusive  of  the  approved  village  plan  and  specific  project \nproposal, technical certification of work done, and expenditure receipts, where applicable. The \ncommunity organizations will take over O&M upon completion.  \n31.  Medium-Scale Local Government-Managed Initiatives. The Project will finance not \nless than 91 medium-scale rural infrastructure projects (up to PRs6 million each) on a grant \nbasis to the village communities within the project area. The projects to be financed under this \nsubcomponent include rural infrastructure, such as water supplies, link roads, culverts, small \nbridges,  school  buildings  on  higher  ground  for  protection  against  cyclones,  floods,  or \nearthquakes.  A  demand-driven  process  for  selection  will  be  used,  involving  applications \ntriggered by requests from communities through locally operating NGOs. The proposed project \nwill be developed after intensive consultations with beneficiary communities. The project will be \nendorsed by a public meeting, documented in a project book by the applicant NGO, with \nparticipation and voting by at least 60% of the households living in the project area at the time of \nproposal.  Beneficiary  communities  should  commit  a  portion  of  the  project  cost  as  their \ncontribution, either in kind or in cash.   \n32.  The proposals must meet the following criteria: (i) potential to benefit the poorer and \ndisadvantaged  sections  of  the  community,  particularly  women;  (ii)  potential  to  create  a \nsustainable medium- and long-term impact on poverty and social inequality; (iii) beneficiaries \nable to contribute 2% of the counterpart funds, in cash or in kind; and (iv) incorporation of \n ", "8   \nmeasures that promote transparency and accountability in project implementation. In addition, \nthe NGO forwarding the proposed project should commit itself to ensuring transparency in all of \nits activities and transactions. \n33.  After  DPIU\u2019s  initial  screening  of  compliance  with  the  selection  criteria,  the  district \ngovernments will undertake the feasibility study and cost estimates on these proposals. Once \nthese are completed and DPIU checks safeguard compliance, the proposals will be submitted to \nthe selection committee for the final selection process. The selection committee, which will be \nchaired by the director general CDA, will comprise (i) an additional secretary, GoS Works and \nServices  Department;  (ii)  the  district  coordination  officer  of  either  Thatta  or  Badin  District \n(depending on the location of the application); (iii) a representative from one of the three NGOs \non the project steering committee (PSC) by rotation; and (iv) a senior woman representative \nfrom a local NGO working in the relevant district project area, or (if local NGOs cannot agree on \na candidate) a representative from the district chapter of the All Pakistan Women\u2019s Association.  \n34.  The projects approved by the selection committee will go through the regular tender \nprocess of the district government, with project funds provided through the Sindh provincial \nbudget. However, the tender notice will mention clearly that tender documents and information \ncan be obtained from DPIU, in addition to the offices of the concerned line agencies. A team, \nwith one representative each from the relevant district line agency, DPIU, and deputy district \nofficer (revenue), will open the contracts and decide on the winning bidder. The safeguard \nspecialist from the DPIU will attend as observer. The winning contractor will implement the work \nin close collaboration with the local NGO and the community, relevant district agencies, and the \nDPIU. The contractor\u2019s contract will require cooperation with all stakeholders on matters of \ntransparency and accountability.  \n35.  The districts will implement, operate, and maintain the selected projects. With local NGO \nsupport, villagers will maintain project books with all the details on the scheme, including design, \nbudget, contractor, time frame, payments, and comments or questions by the area residents. \nThe DPIU will review and discuss the project books with the local NGO and villagers at least \nthree times during construction to ensure transparency, accountability, and understanding. The \nDPIU will ensure that important scheme details are entered on a Web site, and posted in the \nproject area and on local notice boards in the taluka. Project funds have been allocated to help \ndefray district and local NGO costs, and to provide a grievance system to help area residents \naddress their concerns in a timely manner. \n3.  Improved coastal management \n36.  Mangrove Planting. This subcomponent provides for planting of not less than 3,350 ha  \nclusters of mangroves at sites in the intertidal zones to provide significant disaster protection \nfrom  storm-induced  tidal  surges  and  episodic  cyclones.  The  plantations  will  also  improve \nsubstantially  the  coastal  environment,  thereby  increasing  biodiversity,  and  provide  much-\nneeded new habitats for juvenile commercial fish stocks. Community members who work on the \nplantations will benefit from wood and vegetation yields in these new sites, fish cultivation \noptions  in  their  mangrove  areas,  and  a  partnership  with  the  government  for  sustainable \nmanagement of mangrove resources. The mobilized communities will have an increased sense \nof ownership and commitment to the Project, which will strengthen subcomponent effectiveness. \n37.  Sites have been identified in Thatta at Keti Bander and Shah Bander, and in Badin at the \nnorthwest corner of the Zero Point Inland Sea. About 3,000 ha of new plantings and 350 ha of \ninfill planting will be done along tidal creeks and in the intertidal zone of the dhand (swamp) \nsystem near Ahmad Rajo. The areas have been selected based on (i) suitability of soil and tidal \nflow  characteristics  for  maximum  environmental  enhancement,  (ii)  absence  of  significant \npollution,  (iii)  presence  of  adjacent  coastal  rural  communities  that  can  be  mobilized  for \nmangrove management, and (iv) absence of coverage by other rehabilitation programs. Two \n ", "          9\nlocal mangrove species which have been planted successfully in the project area, Avicennia \nmarina and Rhizophora mucronata, will be used for the Project. Small saplings will be planted in \nmixed-species and single-species clusters and belts 50\u2013100 meters wide. The mangroves will \nbe planted at a density of about 1,100 plants per ha, or one plant per nine square meters.  \n38.  International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) will work \nclosely  with  the  Sindh  Forestry  Department  and  NRSP,  starting  with  a  public  information \ncampaign about the multiple benefits of mangroves. IUCN, NRSP, and the Department of \nForests will engage communities living near the planting areas that choose to participate in \nmangrove planting and establishment. Further, IUCN will arrange for community training in \nmangrove sustainable management, and in mangrove planting and tending techniques. The \nSindh Provincial Forest and Wildlife Department (SFWD) will manage the physical nursery \nestablishment and mangrove planting processes, providing all necessary technical and logistical \nsupport  plus  payment  for  agreed  services.  SFWD  will  arrange  community  policing  and \nreplanting activities. IUCN, with NRSP links, will provide communities with training and technical \nsupport on how to protect and sustainably use the mangrove areas for fodder, fuel, and fisheries \nproduction and sale. IUCN will use global positioning systems to mark off areas to be placed in \nthe CDA GIS, monitor processes, and report on results. \n39.  Prawn and Crab Ponds, and Bivalve and Seaweed Raft Cultivation. The second \nsubcomponent entails developing simple aquaculture ponds and trials of prawn, crab, bivalve, \nand seaweed cultivation methods. Households can replicate these if the technology is found \nappropriate and environmental safeguards are incorporated. Endogenous species fully adapted \nto local environmental conditions have been selected: (i) two prawn species, Penaeus indicus \nand Penaeus merguiensis; (ii) the mud crab, Scylla serrata; (iii) a local species of oyster, \nCrassostrea rivularis; (iv) the mussel, Perna viridisand; and (v) local seaweed species, Ulva. \nEnteromorpha Porphyra. Saline water shrimp ponds and crab ponds will be pilot tested.9 If the \npilot is successful, suitable government-owned land for more ponds will be available, subject to \nadvance environmental planning and regulation to avoid future pollution and environmental \ndegradation. Rafts can be sited at many creeks. Private sector interest and potential financing \nfrom a local commercial bank10 have been confirmed. \n40.  At each of two sites, 10 ponds will be constructed\u2014five for crabs and five for shrimp. \nThe 20 trial ponds will be 20 meters by 50 meters, or about 0.1 ha each. The ponds will be dug \ndeeply into sites above mean high tide level, with bunds to prevent encroachment during spring \ntides. Seawater will be supplied by a gravity-fed system relying on the ebb and flow of the twice-\ndaily tide. The shrimp ponds will be seeded with post-larvae from the Hawkes Bay shrimp \nhatchery or Gharo site. The crab ponds will be seeded with young crabs caught by local \nvillagers in the mangrove swamps. The crabs will be fed trash fish and shrimp. The shrimp will \nfeed on commercial feed pellets, or a combination of cow and poultry waste, diaminophosphate, \nmolasses, and yeast. Shrimp ponds yield 1,950 kilograms (kg) per ha after 4 months, and crab \nponds produce 4,735 kg/ha after 4 months. The market for shrimps is large, with local prices in \nthe project area at PRs450\u2013500/kg. Crabs are a valuable export with a significant market \n(PRs80/kg on pond sites), and the potential for direct seaweed exports and local sale of extracts \nis high. Harvest and marketing of the prawns and crabs will be managed carefully, taking into \nconsideration a good return fairly distributed to the local communities involved in the operation. \n41.  Oysters and mussels as well as seaweed will be cultivated on a pilot scale by growing \nthem on ropes attached to simple rafts. Six rafts will be sited at each of three sites (three for \nmussels and oysters, and three for seaweed) with two extra for bivalves in the most promising \n                                                 \n9  The Centre of Excellence in Marine Biology, University of Karachi has conducted successful trials on crab pond \nculture in Sandspit near Karachi, while the Gharo aquaculture facility in Thatta has conducted trials on prawn \nculture.   \n10 Khushali Bank, in discussions with the President of the bank on 28 September 2006. \n ", "10  \nlocation. The 20 initial pilot rafts will be anchored in the mangrove creeks, allowing them to be \nflushed twice a day by the ebb and flow of the tides. Seed for the mussels and oysters occurs \nnaturally on a seasonal basis, and will attach to the ropes. Young stages of seaweed will be \ncollected and attached to ropes. Water testing for pollution will ensure proper placement. \n42.  The ponds and rafts will be managed in collaboration with the SLFD facilities at Gharo \nand Hawkes Bay. NRSP will mobilize community organizations in villages to assist in the pilot-\nscale trials. Community members will be trained in cultivation and harvesting techniques, and in \nthe maintenance and policing of ponds and rafts. Following successful pilot-scale replication, \nthe cultivation of crabs, shrimp, bivalves, and seaweed will be extended to the third site at Zero \nPoint, and at the Keti Bander and Shah Bander sites with 80 additional ponds and 80 rafts, \nbringing the total to 100 ponds and 100 rafts. IUCN will monitor environmental impact carefully. \n43.  Hatchery Rehabilitation. This subcomponent will provide minor production capacity \nupgrades  to  the  Badin  fresh  water  and  brackish  water  hatchery,  the  Hawkes  Bay  marine \nhatchery, and the marine rearing facility at Gharo. These improvements will enable them to \nprovide  seed  for  the  trials,  address  technical  needs  and  experimental  pond  management \nsupport, and provide suitable training to potential prawn and crab cultivation households. The \nhatcheries and rearing facility will provide fry for the stocking of marine shrimp ponds, and fin fry \nfor the local fresh water and brackish water areas in the talukas of the project area. The \nupgraded hatcheries will be provided with technical assistance (TA) to enable installation of \ntraining for village households in appropriate options for aquaculture based on the survey work \nto  be  undertaken.  Fisheries  officials  will  also  work  with  community  groups  to  facilitate \nsustainable yield and reseeding, as appropriate, in coastal lakes and ponds. \n44.  SLFD will upgrade the hatcheries in collaboration with district governments. International \nand national consultants will provide advice on needed improvements to meet the requirements \nof the proposed pilot village-based aquaculture activities. SLFD will procure civil works and \nequipment with PMU support and develop and deliver training regularly on villager pond and raft \nmanagement in collaboration with NRSP, local NGOs, and community organizations. \n  4.  Project Management \n45.  This component includes the PMU, two DPIUs, vehicles, furnishings, equipment, and \nconsultants. The Project will provide full-time institutional specialists, one based in each DPIU to \nconduct a training needs analysis of the planning and monitoring capacity of public servants. \nThe  specialist  will  provide  training  and  hands-on  support  to  improve  the  skills  and \nimplementation capability of government officials. \nC.   Special Features \n46.  Community-Driven Development Processes. The Project will develop the capacity of \ncommunities to undertake participatory planning and resource allocation based on a simple, \nresults-oriented approach grounded in the principles of community empowerment, transparency, \nand ownership. With NRSP facilitation, communities will (i) organize themselves, (ii) decide \nwhat their most pressing problems are and how best to address them, (iii) mobilize a portion of \nthe resources needed to deal with their issues, and (iv) manage and monitor the changes in \ntheir conditions. Capacity building, small- and medium-scale interventions, mangrove planting \narrangements,  and  experimentation  in  villager  aquaculture  will  be  community-driven.  This \nprocess  will  empower  communities,  which  is  necessary  to  address  poverty  and  access \nproblems in a sustainable manner.  \n47.  Simplified  Implementation  Processes  for  Faster  Startup,  Using  Trusted  and \nProven Partnerships. Under the Project, NRSP will implement the community organization, \nincome  generation  and  small-scale  initiatives  activities.  NRSP  will  work  together  with \nGovernment agencies and other NGOs for mangrove planting (Coastal Forest Division, with \n ", "         11\nIUCN), fisheries surveying and pond and aquaculture development (Fisheries), and district \ngovernment for medium-scale infrastructure. NRSP\u2019s presence in the two project districts, and \nsuccessful history of community development in 34 other districts throughout Pakistan, places it \nin a unique position to expand to the harsher coastal zone of Sindh. With its internship practice, \nNRSP is able to field additional staff in the shortest time possible and can start working in the \nproject areas quickly to engage with poor households and start providing a reliable community \npresence.  IUCN\u2019s  12  years  of  work  with  SFWD  will  also  provide  rapid  engagement  for \nmangrove and coastal zone management with project area communities. \n48.  Transparent  Anticorruption  Mechanisms  at  the  Local  Level.  Making  programs \naccountable to beneficiaries and insisting on effective public transparency of information helps \nensure  integrity  and  success  in  small-scale  civil  works  programs.  The  integrity  measures \nintroduced under the Project include (i) community-led and -validated project identification; \n(ii) transparent selection criteria and processes; (iii) participatory review and public audit of the \nschemes involving the local communities; (iv) project books that provide detailed information on \nproject design, costing, implementation processes, and finances maintained in the villages to \nensure accessibility to the beneficiaries and their communities; (v) project-related information \ndisseminated on publicly accessible media, such as local radio, notice boards, and Web site; \n(vi) selection committee with representation from the community, including women, to make the \nfinal selection on medium-scale infrastructure to be financed under the Project; (vii) provision for \ndistribution of tender documents and information from the DPIU office as well as the concerned \nline agency office; and (viii) grievance review mechanism with provision of a focal point in the \ndistricts for any complaints about community issues. Further details are in Appendix 5. \n49.  Gender Responsiveness. The Project has significant potential for greater gender equity \nthrough improved resource decision making by women, which will contribute to overall poverty \nreduction and improved ecosystem management. A project-specific Gender Action Plan (GAP) \nhas  been  formulated  to  promote  the  equal  participation  of  all  stakeholders  as  project \nbeneficiaries  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  Proposed  GAP  activities  aim  to  (i)  establish \nmechanisms to ensure women\u2019s representation in decision-making processes, and targets for \nthe number of women community organizations, trainees, and village activists; (ii) integrate \nwomen\u2019s needs into project subcomponents; (iii) establish targets for female staff in project \nimplementing  agencies;  and  (iv)  ensure  the  effective  involvement  of  women  in  project \nmonitoring and evaluation, including gender-disaggregated data for these purposes.  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n50.  Cost estimates for the Project are in Table 1. The project cost is estimated at about \n$40.1 million, including physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest during \nimplementation. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n51.  The Government has asked ADB to provide a loan for the equivalent of $36.0 million \nfrom its Special Fund resources to finance 90% of the project cost. The Government and \nbeneficiaries will cover the balance. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years, with an annual interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the Government of Sindh on the \nsame terms and conditions as those between the Government and ADB. The GoS shall make \nthe entire proceeds of the Loan available to CDA on a grant basis. The Government of Sindh \nwill assume the foreign exchange risk. The financing plan is in Table 2.  \n52.  The current country cost-sharing ceiling is 75%. The higher cost sharing for this project \nis justified for two main reasons. First, the project activities are important for environmental \nprotection and reduction of extreme poverty. This will enable Government costs for welfare and \n ", "12  \nenvironmental mitigation in the area to decline over time and tax revenues to increase, releasing \nprovincial funds for loan repayment. Second, Government budget contributions being provided \nfor  social  services  and  disaster  mitigation  demonstrate  its  higher  financial  contribution  to \naddress the overall development issues in the coastal zone. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimatesa \n($ million) \nComponent        Total \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n53.  The  PSC  will  be  established  by  the  Government  of  Sindh  to  ensure  high  level \ninteragency coordination and cooperation, provide policy guidance and reform support, and \nfacilitate project implementation. Chaired by the additional chief secretary of the Planning and \nDevelopment Department, the PSC will have the following members: (i) secretary, finance; \n(ii) secretary, local government and spatial development; (iii) secretary, livestock and fisheries; \n(iv) representative from the Navy; (v) secretary, forest and wildlife; (vi) secretary, environment \nand  alternative  energy;  (vii)  district  coordination  officer  of  Thatta  District;  (viii)  district \ncoordination officer of Badin District; (ix) Khushali Bank senior official; (x) director general of \nCDA; (xi) chief executive officer of NRSP; (xii) senior representative from IUCN Pakistan; (xiii) a \nsenior representative from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Pakistan; (xiv) a senior \nrepresentative from the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum; (xv) project director as member secretary of \nthe committee; and (xvi) other parties deemed appropriate by the PSC and appointed at the first \nmeeting after loan effectiveness. Membership is consistent with that of the steering committee \nfor the project preparatory technical assistance. The PSC will meet at least twice a year. \n54.  The Executing Agency will be the Coastal Development Authority (CDA), while the \nimplementing agencies will be (i) SFWD (mangrove planting); (ii) CDA (community organization, \nsmall-scale community-managed initiatives, CDA capacity building, and project management); \n(iii)  SLFD  (fisheries  and  water  quality  survey,  shrimp  and  crab  ponds  and  bivalve  rafts \ndevelopment, hatchery rehabilitation); and (iv) the district governments of Badin and Thatta \n(medium-scale local government-managed infrastructure). SFWD and SLFD each will appoint \nan officer at BPS 19 to supervise implementation of the components under its responsibility. In \nperforming project responsibilities, these officers will report to the project director. The Project \nwill establish a PMU  within the CDA, Karachi, headed by a project director supported by \nappropriate technical and support staff, including a rural infrastructure engineer. All professional \nstaff will be appointed through competitive processes acceptable to ADB. The project director \nwill  report  to  the  director  general,  CDA.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) overseeing \ninteragency and inter-district coordination and cross-learning for project activities; (ii) recruiting \nconsultants and NGOs, and awarding procurement and consulting contracts; (iii) consolidating, \nreviewing, and submitting regular progress and financial reports to the PSC and ADB; and \n(iv) monitoring and evaluating project outputs and results. The PMU will serve as the secretariat \nof the PSC and the selection committee, and will be the focal point for liaison between the \nGovernment and ADB.  \n55.  In each project district, the Project also will establish a DPIU, which will be headed by a \nDPIU director who will report to the project director and will have six professional staff and other \nsupport staff as required. All professional staff will be appointed through competitive process \nacceptable to ADB. The DPIU will be responsible for (i) undertaking field-level coordination, \nfacilitation, and monitoring of inputs; (ii) supporting and training district governments in planning, \nmonitoring,  and  local  NGO  liaison;  (iii) ensuring  that  safeguard  conditions  are  met  for \nenvironment, land acquisition, and indigenous peoples, as well as promoting project integrity; \n(iv) monitoring gender and other social concerns; and (v) providing ongoing support to project \nactivities within the District where frequent interagency coordination is required. The project \norganizational flowcharts and structures of the PMU and DPIUs are in Appendix 7. \n56.  Project allowances to be provided to the GoS and key CDA staff will be paid twice a \nyear, provided that the project milestones for specific components established in the inception \nteam building workshop, and agreed with ADB, are met fully during the previous period. GoS \nhas confirmed these arrangements. \n ", "14  \n2.  Microcredit Opportunities and Links \n57.  Certain activities foreseen under the Project will require anticipated beneficiaries to have \naccess  to  microcredit.  Khushali  Bank  has  opened  branches  in  Thatta  and  Badin  for  this \npurpose. Contingent on a feasibility assessment, Khushali Bank has committed to provide a \ndedicated center for microfinance services by August 2007. In addition, NRSP has agreed to \napply to the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) for additional financing for microcredit to \ncommunity organizations in the project area, based on the budget provided under the Project. \nAs NRSP has a longstanding financing arrangement with PPAF, this application is likely to be \napproved under the current or planned World Bank loan ($400 million). A proposed Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction grant will provide funding for mobile banking service pilots in the project \narea.11 Funding has been included in the project budget for microcredit officers starting in the \nsecond year, and can be used if PPAF funds are provided to NRSP for the project area.  \n3.  Implementation Period \n58.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and \ncompleting project implementation by 31 December 2012. The closing date for disbursements \nwill be 30 June 2013. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n4.  Procurement \n59.  Goods, related services, and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time); and, where appropriate, will be \nconsistent with the government rules on small works. Civil works contracts valued at less than \n$1 million may be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB), limited international \nbidding  (LIB),  shopping,  or  community  participation  in  procurement,  as  determined  by  the \ncircumstances of the contract packages. The goods and equipment contracts will be procured \nusing the LIB, NCB, or shopping procedures. CDA will certify to ADB that the goods and \nservices financed by the loan are procured from ADB member countries. ADB must approve in \nadvance  the  awarding  of  contracts  and  substantial  contract  variations,  as  indicated  in  the \nprocurement plan in Appendix 9.  \n5.  Consulting Services \n60.  The  Project  will  provide  250  person-months  of  specialized  services  of  national \nconsultants, as well as 23 person-months of international consulting services under long-term \nand  short-term  appointments  through  consulting  firms  and  individual  consultants  for  the \nfollowing areas: (i) crab and prawn pond and bivalve and seaweed raft technology, (ii) financial \nmanagement and external spot audits, (iii) aquaculture food systems and hatcheries technology, \n(iv)  GIS  technology,  (v)  fisheries  biology,  and  (vi)  standing  water  quality  assessment. \nProfessional field staff will provide an additional 3,024 person-months of services under the \ncommunity mobilization and small-scale interventions contract. Project management staff will \nprovide 2,208 person-months of services. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). Two single-\nsource selection contracts are justified in paras. 61 and 62. The Government has agreed to \nrecruit individual consultants under the Project in accordance with ADB's relevant procedures \n(Appendix 9). A list of all consultants, staff, and related government officers is in Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n61.  NRSP will provide the consulting services for community organization and small-scale \ninitiatives  under  single-source  selection.  NRSP,  the  largest  national  NGO  of  this  kind  in \nPakistan, is the only one with the scope, financial management systems, and ability to deliver \n                                                 \n11  PAK: Microfinance for the Poorest, submitted to the Government of Japan on 1 November 2006 for $2 million by \nADB\u2019s West and Central Asia Department, Governance, Finance, and Trade Division. \n ", "         15\nthe community organization, links, and small-scale initiatives planned under the Project. An \ninstitutional  assessment  of  NRSP  undertaken  during  appraisal  confirmed  NRSP\u2019s  unique \ncapability for this contract. NRSP has agreed to be paid its management overhead based on its \nachievement of semiannual milestones, consistent with component and project objectives to be \nagreed upon before contracting. The budget assumes that ADB\u2019s Sindh Rural Development \nProject (footnote 6) will finance the establishment of the regional and district offices. The NRSP \nreview is in Appendix 10. \n62.  IUCN  will  provide  consulting  services  for  community  mangrove  planting  and \nmanagement, as well as monitoring and evaluation of mangrove planting, and crab and prawn \npond environmental effects and issues. IUCN is the world\u2019s largest conservation network. In \nPakistan, IUCN has been working for over 12 years on mangrove area planting, environmental \nmanagement  of  mangrove  areas  and  related  biodiversity,  and  community  participation  in \nmangrove replanting and fisheries management in the project areas and elsewhere.  \n63.  The Government has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing under the \nProject. The purposes of the advance contracting and retroactive financing are to help ensure \nthe timely and accurate completion of the Planning Commission Proforma-1(PC-1), continue the \nongoing preparation for a rapid project startup, and enable contract finalization and fielding of \nNRSP and IUCN. The retroactive financing will be in effect for not more than 12 months after \nthe date of the Loan Agreement to be used for Project management related expenditure. The \nGovernment has been informed that the amount of the retroactive financing must not exceed \n20%  of  the  ADB  loan  amount,  and  that  approval  of  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n6.  Anticorruption  \n64.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government and the Executing Agency. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nAnticorruption (1998) are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nExecuting Agency, implementing agencies, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project.   \n65.  At the start of the Project, a financial management specialist will help ensure that project \nrecords  are  structured  and  kept  appropriately  to  meet  ADB  and  Government  integrity \nrequirements. The Project will recruit an auditor to perform spot checks on all project and \nproject-related accounts. Special integrity measures to enhance governance in the small-scale \ninitiatives and medium-scale community infrastructure have been incorporated into the Project. \nThese are reflected in paras. 28 and 31\u201333 and in Appendix 5. \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n66.  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2001, as amended from time to time). Direct payment procedures will be used for \nconsulting services and equipment following LIB procedures. For civil works following NCB \nprocedures  and  small  expenditures  related  to  the  PMU,  reimbursement  and  imprest  fund \nprocedures will be applied. After loan effectiveness, the PMU will open an imprest account at \nthe State Bank of Pakistan. The initial deposit to the imprest account will not exceed the \nestimated expenditures for 6 months of project implementation or 10% of the loan, whichever is \nlower.  Following  a  financial  management  assessment  to  confirm  the  capacity  of  the \ndepartments, two second generation imprest accounts\u2014one each for SFWD and SLFD\u2014may \n ", "16  \nbe  established  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  to  enable  field  operations  for  mangrove \nplanting, and for fisheries surveys and field training. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure \nwill be applied to reimburse expenditures, and to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for \npayments of $50,000 and less. The currency of the imprest account will be in US dollars, and \nthe currency of the two second generation imprest accounts will be in Pakistani rupees. \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n67.  CDA, through the PMU, will maintain project accounts acceptable to ADB in accordance \nwith the ADB.12\u2019 Further, CDA, through the PMU, will maintain separate records and accounts \nfor  goods,  works,  and  services  to  be  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  and  Government \nfinancing  following  sound  accounting  principles.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the \naccounts and records annually. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified \ncopies  of  the  audit  report  in  English,  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion,  will  be  submitted  to  the \nGovernment and ADB. The audit reports will include a management letter and a separate \nopinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedure. The \nGovernment has been advised that delays in the submission of audited financial statements \nmight result in the suspension of loan and grant disbursements by ADB.   \n68.  The PMU will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports will indicate (i) \nprogress  made;  (ii)  problems  encountered;  (iii)  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems;  (iv) \nprogram of activities; and (v) expected progress during the remaining implementation period, as \nwell as project performance data. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and \nquality, consistent with the project framework. The project completion report will be submitted by \nthe PMU within three months of the project completion date. \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n69.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the outcome and outputs, the PMU \nwill establish a baseline and project performance monitoring system (PPMS) consistent with \nADB  and  Government  reporting  requirements.  During  the  project  inception  team  building \nworkshop, a matrix of sub-indicators will be developed with at least annual milestones linked to \nthe performance indicators in Appendix 1. The PPMS will be established by the end of the first \nyear. Baseline data will be gathered, and progress updates will be provided semiannually to \ninterested stakeholders and the public. \n10.   Project Review \n70.  CDA, GoS, and ADB will review the implementation of the Project semiannually, using \nthe information gathered from the PPMS and the progress reports on the project activities. The \nreviews will consider (i) achievement of loan covenants; (ii) physical achievements against \nmilestones, with any reasonable changes, and disbursement and financial progress; (iii) project \nimplementation changes and areas requiring resolution or action; (iv) interagency operations \nand engagement; and (v) media and information flows to stakeholders and the public. Close \ncoordination with the resident mission will ensure effective participation and representation of \nADB. \n71.  During the first half of the fourth year of project implementation, ADB, CDA, and GoS \njointly  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  (MTR).  The  MTR  will  review  and \nevaluate  (i)  project  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  progress  against \nagreed indicators based on the project framework; (iii) procurement performance; (iv) PMU and \nNGO effectiveness; (v) performance of the consultants; (vi) potential options to shift funds \nbetween small-scale initiatives and medium-scale community infrastructure; (vii) options for \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003.

Manila \n ", "         17\nimplementation of recommendations of the fisheries and water quality survey, and the pilot pond \nand raft activities, including a detailed environmental impact assessment; and (vii) any other \nissues agreed upon by ADB, the CDA, and GoS. A month before the MTR, the PMU will submit \na comprehensive analysis of each of these issues, as well as others that are appropriate. At the \nconclusion  of  the  MTR,  the  ADB  and  GoS  will  agree  on  changes  in  project  scope  and \nimplementation arrangements deemed necessary. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits  \n72.  The Project will provide four types of mechanisms with measurable impact: (i) skills \ntraining  and  links  to  microcredit  for  income-generation  options;  (ii)  microsavings; \n(iii) development  of  mangrove  stands  and  simple  aquaculture  options  for  household-level \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  provision  of  small-scale  initiatives  and  medium-scale  community \ninfrastructure. For simplicity and clarity, the final economic analysis was completed on the \ncontributions of the pond and raft mariculture, as well as the returns to mangrove plantations \nand related fish production. Workers also will benefit from wood and vegetation yields in these \nnew sites, fish cultivation options in their mangrove areas, and a partnership with government \nfor sustainable management of the mangrove resources. The mobilized communities will have \nan increased sense of ownership and commitment, which will strengthen the subcomponent\u2019s \neffectiveness and sustainability.  \n73.  The Project will introduce shrimp, crab, bivalve, and seaweed aquaculture linked to \nprotective planting of the mangroves. Aquaculture based on community ponds and rafts will \nprovide livelihood opportunities, and household incomes will increase as a result of finfish, \nshrimp, and crab and bivalve sales. The benefits from mangroves include increases in fish \nstocks and fish catch, sales of firewood and fodder, and protection of land that otherwise \nprobably would be lost to seawater encroachment. Additionally, these activities will likely enable \ncommunities to improve management of their natural resource base, enabling more diversified, \nregular, and sustainable incomes from these sources. Investment in mangrove planting and \naquaculture yields economic internal rates of return (EIRR) of 27.5% and 24.6%, respectively.  \n74.  The  base  case  EIRR  for  the  Project,  which  assumes  the  community  development \ncomponent is a pure cost, is estimated at 16% (net present value of PRs71.9 million, or $1.2 \nmillion at 12% discount rate). This EIRR is considered within an acceptable range. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the Project is modest to robust with regard to changes in costs and \nbenefits. For the community-based participatory initiatives, the benefits of link roads have been \nevaluated  based  on  the  availability  of  average  daily  traffic  data  and  the  probability  that \ncommunities would select roads for funding. The EIRR for such roads is 15.38%. \n75.  The poverty impact of the Project is measured using a weighted average incidence of \nthe poor in each of the categories of project beneficiaries as the means of estimating the poor \nas a proportion of all project beneficiaries. The resulting poverty impact ratio is estimated at \n59.9%. This supports the overall thrust of the Project, which is to reduce poverty. \nB.  Social Impacts \n76.   All communities where the community organizations operate will have increased access \nto fresh water, schools and clinics, safety areas, and other infrastructure on a demand basis. \nThe  result  will  be  improved  health,  educational  opportunities,  and  market  access  for  all \nhouseholds in the affected villages, reaching far beyond the directly targeted beneficiary group. \nIn addition, access to microsavings and safety areas provides a community cushion against \ndisasters, and helps prevent households from having to borrow for emergencies. Thus, poor \nhouseholds are protected from labor bondage, and the physical safety of families and their \nmovable assets is increased. The community organization process has a number of intangible \n ", "18  \nbenefits, including increasing trained leaders, improving access to government services through \ngreater knowledge and group leverage, expanding community social capital, and enhancing \nself-confidence and support.  \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n77.  Under ADB\u2019s environmental classification system, the Project has been designated \ncategory B. An initial environmental examination (IEE) (Supplementary Appendix D) has been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  environmental  review \nprocedures. Potential negative environmental impacts from the Project are not anticipated to be \nsignificant. The selection criteria for subprojects exclude any sites of ecological importance, or \nsubprojects identified as having significant negative impact. The environmental assessment and \nreview procedure (EARP) prepared for the Project (Supplementary Appendix E) will be utilized \nto screen and evaluate proposed subprojects for approval.  \nD.  Risks \n78.  A review of experience in coastal Sindh, experience with other projects, and a general \nknowledge of prevailing climatic conditions in the project area suggest the following risks:  \n79.  Cyclone and Storm Surges. Unprotected initiatives in parts of the project area subject \nto storm surges have a probability of being damaged by floods in one out of every three years. \nThe probability of a major disaster in the zone is 1 year out of every 30 years. To reduce these \nrisks, the pre-selection safeguard review will consider carefully the likelihood of damage in any \narea. Options for protection will be discussed and implemented, including the promotion of \nsafety area construction of schools in the most vulnerable areas. Disaster preparedness will be \na core part of training for the community organization members and their communities.     \n80.  Declining Fresh water Discharge to the Indus River Delta. The ongoing activities \nupstream from the delta area, including growth of Karachi and further irrigation projects, suggest \nthat the amount of water flowing to the sea will be low for the foreseeable future. This will \ncontinue  to  have  major  environmental  impacts,  including  salt  water  intrusion  into  coastal \naquifers,  shoreline  erosion  due  to  lack  of  sediment  deposition,  and  other  factors.  Project \nactivities will facilitate the population\u2019s adjustment to an environment with much lower availability \nof fresh water, enabling the people to cope with these changes more effectively. \n81.  Institutional Disengagement. The Project is established to help very poor households \nreduce poverty. For the process to be effective, the NGOs and Government agencies must work \nclosely together, and focus on empowerment of the beneficiaries. To reduce this risk, resources \nand roles of all parties have been delineated clearly and simplified. The GoS has encouraged \nstrongly collaboration well before project startup. Effective DPIUs, PMU, and PSC should help \nresolve any confusion or misunderstandings. \n82.  Sustainability  and  Operation  and  Maintenance.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  NRSP  will \nimplement the key community development subcomponents, with an endowment fund that can \nhelp extend community empowerment benefits beyond the project life. NRSP also will assist in \nthe formation of citizen community boards for longer-term operations. Community organizations \nwill identify, plan, implement, and maintain the subprojects under the small-scale initiatives. For \nmedium-scale community infrastructure, the Government will ensure that the O&M budget will \nbe sustained. DPIU engineers will be responsible for monitoring both, with regular review by the \nPMU senior rural engineer. \n83.  None of the project components, activities, or civil works is expected to entail any land \nacquisition, conversion, donation, or restrictions of access that will trigger ADB's policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995). The GoS will ensure that no project component or activity will \nentail  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  or  any  permanent  or  temporary  adverse \nsocioeconomic impacts arising from any land acquisition, conversion, donation, or restrictions of \n ", "         19\naccess. Further, the GoS will ensure that any land utilized for the Project, whether government-\nowned or otherwise, is not occupied or under use as defined by ADB's policy on Involuntary \nResettlement.   \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n(i)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure that the PMU and DPIUs will \nhave been established and fully staffed to the satisfaction of ADB, and remain fully \nstaffed throughout the implementation of the Project. \n(ii)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the Livestock and Fisheries Department and the \nForest and Wildlife Department will each appoint an officer at BPS 19 to supervise the \nimplementation of the Project activities under their responsibility. In undertaking these \nresponsibilities, these officers will report to the Project Director. \n(iii)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure that the Operation Manual \nand Field Guide required for the successful implementation of community organization \nand small scale interventions will have been completed by NRSP to the satisfaction of \nADB.

The GoS will ensure \nthat all tender documents related to the implementation of the medium scale initiatives \nwill be easily accessible to concerned parties, including provision through the DPIU. \n(v)  Within twelve months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure the establishment of a \nProject website which will provide Project-related information including, but not limited to, \ninformation on small and medium scale initiatives. This will enhance transparency and \naccountability in the implementation of the Project. \n(vi)  Within twelve months of loan effectiveness, the GoS will ensure that a grievance review \nmechanism will be established to the satisfaction of ADB. The mechanism will allow the \nintended  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  and  the  local  stakeholders  to  file  and  track \ncomplaints related to the implementation of the Project. The mechanism will include the \nappointment  of  one  of  the  PMU  staff  to  act  as  the  focal  person  in  receiving  and \naddressing the grievances. \n(vii)  The GoS will ensure that all counterpart funds required for the Project, including the cost \nof land acquisition or lease, are allocated in its annual budget and that these funds are \nreleased in a timely manner. GoS will further agree that the counterpart funds not utilized \nby  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year  will  be  carried  forward.  In  the  event  that  it  is  not \npermissible  to  carry  forward  unutilized  counterpart  funds,  the  unutilized  counterpart \nfunds will be reallocated for Project specific purposes in the following fiscal year. \n(viii)  The GoS will ensure the establishment of a maintenance plan and appropriate O&M \nbudget including projected budget requirements for all facilities and improvements to be \nprovided, constructed, or rehabilitated under the Project, except for the small scale \ncommunity-driven initiatives where communities will assume such responsibility. \n(ix)  The Government and GoS will ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy \n(2002) and ensure that all mitigation and monitoring measures set out in the IEE and \nEARP  are  incorporated  and  implemented  in  the  detailed  planning  and  all  Project \n ", "20  \nactivities. Proper monitoring and enforcement of necessary environmental safeguard \nmeasures for pond cultivation will be properly established in the CDA coastal zone \nmanagement plan. The GoS  will allow the lease of its land to any entities for the \nconstruction of prawn or crab ponds within the Project Area upon the establishment of a \nspecific environmental plan with mitigation and remedial measures, taking into account \npotential future problems of pollution. \n(x)  The GoS will employ in reasonable numbers the poor and vulnerable people within the \nProject Area for planting, construction and maintenance activities related to the Project, \nand ensure that the wages are not differentiated between men and women for work of \nequal value. Compliance will be strictly monitored during Project implementation. \n(xi)  The GoS will ensure that all land to be utilized for the Project will be government-owned \nland and not involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate involuntary \nresettlement impacts, including loss of income, resources or assets for the non-titled, as \nspecified under ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement. (1995.) \n(xii)  The GoS will ensure timely and effective implementation of the Gender Action Plan, \nwhereby at least 33% of the Project beneficiaries will be women, and the GoS will take \nall the necessary steps to recruit women professionals for PMU staff, DPIU staff and \nincremental CDA staff, with a target of 33% but not lower than 15% of the staff. \n(xiii)  The Government and GoS will both comply with ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998). \nThe Government and GoS acknowledge ADB\u2019s right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the \nproject, and agree to cooperate fully with such investigation and to extend all necessary \nassistance, including providing access to all relevant books and records, as may be \nnecessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n(xiv)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the initial baseline surveys and established \nProject performance management system consistent with the Project framework will \nhave been completed. At the commencement of Project activities, a matrix of sub-\nindicators  will  be  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  to  substantiate  the  agreed \nperformance indicators. Baseline data will be gathered and will be updated on a semi-\nannual basis. This data will be published in the Project website. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n85.  The Planning Commission Proforma 1 (PC-1) will be duly approved by the competent \nauthority of the Government. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n86.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in    Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?  \n    No      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \nPakistan\u2019s poverty analysis worka shows that about 32.1% of the national population lives in poverty. An additional \n20.4% are just above the poverty line, leaving them vulnerable to household, environmental, or economic shocks that \neasily could push them back into poverty. The national incidence of rural poverty is high at 40.2%. About 60% of \nPakistan\u2019s rural poor are landless. Most of the poor and vulnerable non-poor, when employed, work in the informal \nsector. Thus they are less likely to have stable incomes and move out of poverty. More than half work in agriculture, \nfisheries, and forestry, and another 21% in trade and community services. The rural poor are highly vulnerable to \nchanges in climatic conditions, particularly droughts and cyclones. Typically, the poor have low educational levels and \nlack of access to services, such as fresh water, transport, education, and health services. The combination of few \nincome options and poor access to public service access reinforces their poverty and hopelessness. Women are \nparticularly vulnerable, as they have one of the lowest literacy rates in Asia at 40% and have lower access to paid \nwork than men due to social and other restrictions.   \nThe average per capita income in Sindh Province is about $450 per year. About two thirds of the rural population lives \non less than $1 a day. The project districts\u2014Thatta and Badin\u2014were rated two of the poorest in a 2004 nationwide \nvillage survey.b Only 17% of the land area has fresh water. In addition to lacking fresh water, poor households in \nSindh, and particularly in the project area, are characterized by (i) few income-generating options; (ii) low levels of \neducation (47% literacy for men, 14% for women); and (iii) unmet needs for transport, education, and health services. \nDrought is common, affecting the population dependent on non-irrigated lands in particular. \nSindh has a coastline of approximately 350 kilometers, a major portion of which comprises the Indus River Delta. The \ncoastal areas of Thatta and Badin districts are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and human impact. This has \ncaused continued deterioration of environmental conditions and socioeconomic circumstances. Significantly reduced \nflows in the lower Indus have reduced the availability of irrigation water from the Kotri barrage and increased tidal \nseawater intrusion in the lower reaches of the river. These conditions have resulted in a high level of environmental \ndegradation, consisting of tidal saltwater intrusion, productive land loss, decline in the mangrove habitat, concomitant \nerosion along tidal creeks, and almost certainly a loss of inshore fish stocks. As a result of the water shortage and \ndegradation of groundwater and surface fresh water resources, potable water sources are scarce, with severe \nimplications for agriculture, livestock, human health, and income-generation options. As this continues, more people \nare driven to fishing, or collecting and gathering of wood, bamboo, or reeds for sale. This, in turn, puts additional \npressure on the fragile landscape. \nIn the project area, almost all of the 79% of households below the poverty line of $1 per day have few income-\ngenerating opportunities, little or no access to public services, and high vulnerability to environmental conditions and \necosystem erosion. A multipronged effort is needed to address poverty. The poor must have improved and diversified \noptions for income generation to reduce risk and increase household income. If the households engage in a focused \neffort to regenerate and improve usage of particularly saline areas their income options will expand, contributing to a \nhealthier, sustainable natural resource base. These households also must have better access to public services, \nparticularly fresh water, transport, sanitation, and opportunities for basic education and health services. In this way, \nthey can be healthy and aware enough to exploit new income options. Finally, households must work together to \nenable more effective choices for stabilizing and sustainably exploiting the changing natural environment in which they \nlive, as they depend heavily on their physical circumstances and landscape for most of their income and their \nimproved safety.   \nSince 2001, the Government of Pakistan has approached the multiple problems of poverty reduction much more \naggressively. Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a poverty partnership agreement (PPA) in \n2002.  National  and  provincial  poverty  reduction  strategy  papers  have  been  prepared.  In  recent  years,  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to poverty reduction has been reflected by the increasing trend in pro-poor public sector \nexpenditure, reaching 4.83% of the budget in 2005. The lessons of the past 5 years show clearly that improved \ngovernance, broad-based economic growth (particularly in agriculture and the rural economy), better access to public \nservices, and expanded economic liberalization are the necessary elements for poverty reduction. The Project utilizes \nthese four elements, with the addition of improved natural resource management to help the area households sustain \nthe income effects. \n_________________ \na International Monetary Fund. 2004.

Poverty Analysis                                 Proposed Classification:  Targeted intervention  \n                (geographic intervention) \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nOverall Status and Causes of Poverty  \nA socioeconomic analysis was carried out in the project area of Thatta and Badin districts to assess the expected \nsocioeconomic impact of the Project. Of the 1.04 million persons in the project area, 79% live in poverty. Further, 54% \nof the populations in the eight talukas (subdistrict) were found to be extremely poor (compared with about 12% in the \nnational population).  \n \nThe basic causes of poverty are (i) lack of access to productive resources (mainly water and land); (ii) insufficient \npublic services, such as clean water, health services, education, and transport; and (iii) erosion of household \nresources and income generation options due to illness, ecosystem damage, and natural disasters. Low levels of \neducation  and  social  status  also  contribute  to  poverty.  The  lack  of  sustainable  land  and  water  ecosystem \nmanagement, social protection measures, participatory governance, entrepreneurship, and alternative livelihood \nopportunities make the landless\u2014and women particularly\u2014vulnerable. Poverty in these areas is correlated with (i) \nhousehold economic characteristics, such as no or low land ownership and few employment opportunities; (ii) lack of \naccess to basic services, leading to poor health, lack of education, and vulnerability of most households to natural \nhazards; and (iii) change in the environment from fresh water to brackish water systems, and a lack of training or \nability of the population to adjust to the change and sustainably manage their natural resource base due to insufficient \ninformation, social support, or community engagement. \n \nLandless, small farmers, and fisherfolk identified the main problems in Thatta and Badin as a shortage of fresh water \nsupply, income opportunities, and public services. The community groups\u2019 expectations of the benefits and impacts of \nthe Project are (i) improved drinking water supply; (ii) improved health facilities, including access to medicines and \nhealth care professionals; (iii) access to link roads between remote settlements; (iv) skills development and training, \nincluding materials for schools; and (v) livestock improvement. All women interviewed expected to benefit from the \nProject mainly by improved drinking water followed by health services.   \n \nEconomic and Social Impacts \n \nThe Project will provide a wide range of alternative livelihood opportunities interwoven into a sustainable natural \nresource management process. Essential public services, such as water supplies, roads, bridges, and schools and \ntraining, will be provided on a demand-driven basis to complement the income-generation options. The livelihood \nopportunities will include but not be limited to simple, but important, natural resource management arrangements, \nsuch as mariculture and mangrove replanting. Further, certain income generation options will encourage more \ncommunity-based mobilization of resources and more sustainable use of the ecological base on which people live. By \nwidening their income options, and encouraging sustainable management of the coastal and inland areas, the Project \nwill reduce poverty while also mitigating the ecological impact of sea encroachment. Group access to community-\ndriven public services, such as water, roads, health care, and education, will lower the poverty of services access, \nwhich is a significant problem in the country and the region. Access to safe areas and disaster preparedness \narrangements through the Project also will help households ameliorate risk. \n \nThe project design aims to ensure that the poor, particularly women, receive a substantial share of the benefits from \nincome growth generated by the Project through increased production and employment opportunities. Mangrove \nplantings and mariculture, community mobilization, skills training and links to microcredit, and the provision of small \ngrants for social services and small-scale infrastructure are the main project interventions. The Project will reinforce \ncommunity interest in mangroves, and reward labor for tending and managing the plantings. Household incomes will \nincrease and domestic nutrition will improve by developing mariculture options for village households. Households \nalso  will  have  the  opportunity  to  expand  income  sources  through  skills  training  and  access  to  microcredit. \nImprovement in water supplies, increased access to health and education services, and links to public services and \nmarkets through roads, culverts, and bridges will help increase labor productivity and better access to both markets \nand information. Supportive institutional development work for the Coastal Development Authority in fisheries, and in \ndistrict governments will help orient the government services framework to address poverty more actively. \n \n                                                  \n \n ", " 26     Appendix 2 \n \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe project design is based on a participatory process that included rapid assessment surveys and interviews with \nfocus groups and individual farmer groups, fisherfolk, landless, and women. These activities led to an inventory of \nlocal needs, problems and constraints related to (i) water resources in relation to domestic agriculture, fisheries, \ntransport, environment, and other uses; (ii) possible solutions to resolve the constraints identified, including their \npositive and negative impact on local interest groups; (iii) implications of solutions on poverty reduction; and (iv) \nprioritization of water resources needs relative to other development needs. Stakeholder workshops synthesized the \nfindings and resulted in the development of an action plan of interventions, and in a mechanism to institutionalize the \nlocal community participation in the anticipated interventions. Stakeholder workshops were held in November 2005 in \nDistrict Coordination Officer offices in Badin and Thatta, and in the field with individual farmers and groups of women \nfrom September to December 2005. The project preparatory technical assistance team held consultations with \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), involving approximately 50 participants each, in Badin and Thatta in April \n2006. In July 2006, the Special Project Mission held similar consultations in Thatta. The project appraisal team held \nvillage consultations with 20\u201350 participants, both men and women, in each of the 15 sample villages throughout \ncoastal Badin and Thatta during 18\u201323 September 2006. \n \nIs there a participatory social development strategy prepared?     Yes     No  \n \nProject implementation will be based on a participatory community mobilization and resource assessment and access \nprocess that will strengthen village life and enhance confidence for beneficiaries. National Rural Support Program \n(NRSP) will provide leadership and confidence building training for organizational and capacity building among all \nbeneficiaries, with participation specifically targeted at the poor and women\u2019s groups, in preparation of developing \ncommunity organizations capable of sustained household income expansion and social service access. Civil society \nwill be strengthened by the interaction of NRSP, International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural \nResources (IUCN), and government departments with villagers, and by participating communities understanding they \nhave resources available so they can make their own choices about investments in needed services or infrastructure. \nThe participatory process, especially for the selection of small grant-based interventions, training, and engagement in \nmangrove and fish ponds, will put into place procedures for meaningful beneficiary participation in all stages of the \nProject. The process will include (i) beneficiary-run, NGO-supported processes of resource mapping, poverty profiling, \nhousehold investment planning, and reflection and learning; (ii) procedures and guidelines for beneficiary selection of \nproject interventions; (iii) beneficiary participation in the design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the \nproject activities; and (iv) a comprehensive strategy for access to grant funding and regular project-level coordination \nmeetings with representatives of NRSP and the district government. The Project will establish procedures for close \ncoordination among district-level administration, NRSP, IUCN, and community organizations for effective service \ndelivery.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender disparity and female disadvantages are inherent features of the social structure in Pakistan and in Sindh \nProvince. Most Muslim women, who constitute the majority of women in Sindh, spend their time in unpaid household \nwork and are restricted in their movement and decision making. Women in minority Hindu castes migrate between \npaid jobs on a seasonal basis. Apart from fieldwork, women in paid employment tend cattle and buffalo, collect and \nsell milk, and are involved in sewing and embroidery. \n \nA central issue for women in Sindh is chronic ill health. Although the Project\u2019s gender strategy seeks to empower \nwomen, and to maximize their economic and social benefits within the norms and culture of Sindh, it is important to \nunderstand that poor physical circumstances (especially lack of clean water and limited access to medical facilities) \nlimit the participation of a large proportion of women from economic activity. The Project\u2019s interventions will reduce this \nconstraint substantially. \n \nThe Project adopts a gender mainstreaming strategy that aims to: \n \n(i)  Contribute to the government of Sindh\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, where gender equity plays a major \nrole through capacity building of communities, including women, as agents of development. Community \nmobilization and leadership training will lead to women playing a growing role in the affairs of their \ncommunities. The target of female community organization formation and operation is 50%.   \n \n(ii)  Increase the understanding of project staff at all levels about the role of women in coastal and \n ", "Appendix 2        27\n \necosystem management, and/or rural development.

Introduction \n1.  Poverty  is  a  central  issue  to  almost  all  of  the  coastal  rural  communities  in  Sindh \nProvince, Pakistan, whether they are on the coastline or slightly further inland. Many people in \nthese communities live in abject poverty. Most communities have little access to clean drinking \nwater, and some communities do not have any fresh water at all. Almost all communities \ncomplain of lack of opportunities, poor or nonexistent health facilities, and inadequate schools \nwith absent teachers. \n2.  The economy and sustainability of these rural communities are intimately bound up with \ntheir immediate environment. This environment consists of the mangrove swamps and creeks at \nthe outer fringe of the Indus Delta and their fisheries, as well as the land above high tide level \nwhere subsistence agriculture, with village livestock and fish farming, is practiced. Many of the \nlocal communities depend almost completely on the resources in the mangrove swamps for \ntheir survival. Environmental impoverishment also is high due to (i) the effects of periodic \ncyclones, (ii) the long-term reduction in flow of the Indus River, (iii) salt water intrusion at the \nsurface by tidal encroachment and in the subsurface water accessed by wells, and (iv) the \ngeneral decline of the mangrove swamp ecosystem. \n3.  Sindh coastal households exist in an environment that narrowly defines their economic \noptions. Human interaction with the environment can cause further damage to incomes and to \nthe coastal zone, or help stabilize it and generate opportunities to earn additional income. Given \nthe circumstances of the coastal communities, the key to poverty reduction is a combination of \nincome  and  non-income  interventions  in  the  context  of  a  sustainable  natural  resource \nmanagement process. Accordingly, understanding the coastal environment and its products and \ncircumstances is essential to determining how to improve livelihoods for its inhabitants. The \nfocus areas are mangroves, fisheries, and important plants. \nB.  Mangrove Ecosystems \n4.  The economic importance of mangroves in Pakistan largely comes from the fishery \nresource that they harbor. An estimated 80% of the fish caught in coastal waters spend at least \npart of their life cycle as fry in the mangrove creeks, or depend on the food web within the \nmangrove ecosystem. Shrimp fishery is the major fish export of mangroves, accounting for 68% \nof the $100 million of the foreign exchange the country earns from fisheries exports. The annual \nshrimp landing has reached its maximum sustainable yield of about 30,000 metric tons.1 A \nJune/July ban on shrimp fishing also has been implemented.  \n5.  The mangrove swamps of the Sindh coastal zone are extensive, covering 243,000 \nhectares (ha) compared with 7,400 ha along the Balochistan coast.2 The zone also has large \nareas of bare mud flat. The system is intersected by large and small creeks that allow tidal \nwater to move into and out of the area during the twice-daily ebb and flow of the tides. The \nmangrove swamps are made up of several indigenous species of trees that are adapted to live \nin brackish water or sea water. The main species in the area is the black mangrove Avicennia \nmarina, which has aerial roots growing up out of the mud. The swamps also have less common \nspecies of mangrove tree, the main one on the Sindh coast being the red mangrove Rhizophora \nmucronata. This has prop roots that grow out from the main trunk and then down into the mud, \nstabilizing the plant. Both species of mangrove tree are important sediment and soil stabilizers. \n_________________ \n1  Meadows and Meadows. 2001. Coastal Zone Management and Environmental Impact Assessment.

Karachi. \n ", "Appendix 3        29\n \nSeveral species of marine seaweed also grow in mangrove swamps, often as algal mats on the \nsurface of the mud.  \n6.  The mangrove swamps are relicts of the estuarine conditions that once existed in the \nSindh region, although exact figures on their size are difficult to obtain. Before the construction \nof dams and barrages, mangroves covered an estimated 43% of the intertidal area. This has \ndeclined to about 1% of the total area. The exact cause of this reduction is not known, although \nthe current lack of fresh water input is often blamed. One view is that the process might be \ndifficult to reverse. \n7.  The mangrove swamps are an important part of the biodiversity of the coastal zone of \nSindh. The mangrove swamps, bare mud flats, and mangrove creeks support many animals \nalong  the  Sindh  coast.  These  include  a  large  number  of  invertebrates,  such  as  mussels, \noysters, and shrimp, as well as many species of fish in the creeks. The young stages of shrimp \nand fish live in the creeks, and move offshore as they grow. Some species of birds also use the \nswamps as wintering grounds during their long distance migrations. Although few scientific \nstudies have been conducted in the area, a 1980 survey of the Keti Bundar and Turshian Creek \narea listed more than 40 species of fish and invertebrates.  \n8.  Mangrove  swamps  provide  a  complex  series  of  resources  and  livelihoods  to  local \ncommunities, such as those at Keti Bundar and Shah Bundar, as well as communities living \nfurther inland. The mangrove trees are used for firewood and building, while the mangrove \ngreen shoots and leaves are used as fodder for livestock, for medicinal purposes, and as food \nfor the villagers in some cases. The 100,000 people living along the northern edge of the Indus \nDelta use an estimated 18,000 tons of mangrove firewood each year. At certain times of the \nyear, about 16,000 camels are herded into the mangroves and left to browse for about 6 \nmonths. The creeks provide a source of shrimp and fish for the local village fisherfolk working \nfrom small inshore boats. Bees that live in the mangroves and above the high tide level inland \nprovide honey, which is a valuable marketed commodity.  \n9.  Mangrove swamp ecosystems face a number of threats, as they are an exploitable \nnatural resource for the rural communities along the Pakistan coast. Man-made and natural \nimpacts have degraded the mangroves. These include (i) construction of dams and barrages, \n(ii) fresh water diversion for irrigation, (iii) decrease in fresh water input and sediment load, and \n(iv) increase in salinity. For example, the estimated historic fresh water flow down the Indus is \nabout 150 million acre feet (MAF) per year (180 billion cubic meters). However, over the past 70 \nyears, water abstraction for irrigation has reduced dramatically the supply of fresh water to the \nmangrove forests. The flow reaching the Indus Delta now is less than 35 MAF (43 billion cubic \nmeters), and could decline further to about 10 MAF (12 billion cubic meters) in the next three to \nfive  years.  The  amount  of  silt  discharged,  which  was  about  100  million  tons  per  year,  is \npredicted to fall to 30 million tons during the same period.3 Other threats include domestic and \nindustrial pollution, overgrazing by animals, overcutting of mangroves by rural communities, and \ncyclones and storms. \n10.  Sea level rise caused by global warming poses a major long-term environmental threat \nto the Sindh coastline and its mangrove swamps.4 Over the past century, the rise has been 1.1 \nmillimeters per year. While the predicted sea level rise of 2.00 millimeters per year will support \nmangrove growth, anything above this rate would cause a loss of mangroves. This would \nrequire  replanting  species  with  longer  propagules,  such  as  Rhizophora  mucronata,  and \npropagating  Avicennia  marina  on  higher  grounds,  as  is  occurring  along  the  Balochistan \ncoastline. In the proposed Project, a strong case can be made for interplanting Rhizophora \n_________________ \n3  IUCN. 1992. Environmental Economic Evaluation: Mangrove Ecosystem of the Indus Delta.

Fisherfolk and camel \nherders will be affected by the sea level rise. Sea encroachment will affect directly some of the \n300,000 people of the coastal areas of Thatta district alone. Moreover, salt intrusion will make \nthe agricultural land even more unsuitable for cultivation. Based on the number of fishing boats \naround Gharo, Keti Bundar, Karo Chan, and Shah Bundar, an estimated 20,000 people could \nbe directly impacted on an immediate basis, with many more families affected over the medium \nterm.  \n11.  Mangrove plantation programs produce proven, positive environmental consequences. \nThe most immediate result is a shielding of the area on the landward side of the plantations \nfrom monsoonal and cyclonic waves and wind. This protection becomes more pronounced as \nthe  trees  increase  in  height.  Progressively,  more  noticeable  changes  are  seen  in  creek \nmorphology and position, with associated changes of water flow into and out of the mangrove \nsystem. Changes of sediment deposition and location of mud banks also occur. The presence \nof new developing stands of mangrove trees have a positive impact on biodiversity\u2014more \nspecies of animals and plants become established in the mangrove creeks and forest. As a \nresult, the food webs become more complex and more stable. The economic consequences \ninvolve the input of increased jobs and money into local communities. \n \nC.  Fisheries, Bivalves, and Crabs \n \n12.  Coastal rural communities largely operate the inshore and near-shore fisheries along the \nSindh coast.5 Although these fisheries are well-established, they are almost uncontrolled and, \nhence,  unregulated.  They  consist  of  a  range  of  commercial  finfish  and  shellfish.  Rural \ncommunities access the fisheries by going directly into the mangrove swamp creeks, or by \noperating fishing vessels of various sizes. \n13.  Individual fisherfolk go into the mangrove areas to catch small finfish with one- or two-\nman operated nets, which are used from the shore or thrown by the fisherfolk while standing in \nshallow water. Adults and male children catch crabs in the mangrove swamps by wading in to \nwaist level, and then using baited fishing lines or multi-pronged rods like garden forks. Villagers \nalso operate small to medium-sized fishing boats. The smallest boats are 10\u201315 feet long, carry \none to four fishermen, and operate close to shore in the mangrove creeks. These boats go out \nhourly or daily. Medium-sized fishing boats range in size from about 20 feet to about 45 feet in \nlength, and carry between five and 30 fishermen. They go out daily or weekly. The small and \nmedium-sized fishing boats use a variety of nets, including seines operated between pairs of \nboats, drift nets, trawls, and nets pinned to the seabed to catch fish in the tidal flow. Some of the \nnets are not legal, and are confiscated on an ad hoc basis by Sindh fisheries personnel with \npolice. Confiscation is risky as guns can be used. \n14.  According to a 1986 survey of fishing gear used in Pakistan,6 Sindh fisherfolk use shrimp \ntrawlers and tukri (entangle gill net used for shrimp), rach (gill net used to catch small pelagic \nfish), katra (surround net used to catch small pelagic fish), jalla (cast net), gujii (small drag net), \nbhoola (tidal trap net), and others (beach seine and long lines). Based on a study of fishing nets \nin the Indus Delta, the estimated landing in 1 month by the katra net was 5,040 metric tons, \nwhich included 1.68 metric tons of trash fish. The estimated bhoola net monthly catch was 473.6 \nmetric tons of fish and 28.4 metric tons of shrimp.7 \n_________________ \n5  Ahmad, M. 1985. Marine Fisheries of Pakistan.

Records Zoological \nSurvey of Pakistan. Karachi. \n ", "Appendix 3        31\n \n15.  Shrimp landings have fluctuated from 25,000 to 30,000 tons annually, with declines in \nsome species made up by a catch of lower-value species. The marine finfish landings have \nincreased by about 5% annually, and this fishery is believed to have potential for expansion. \nThis has meant that many fisherfolk have continued to take out loans and become bonded to \nmiddlemen, resulting in economic deprivation. The fast-growing population and the influx of \nmigrating fishing communities to the Indus Delta has put huge pressure on this natural resource. \n16.  Studies conducted in 1986\u20131987 suggested that the fishery was still under-exploited and \nhad room for expansion. The fishery has expanded since then, and landings in 1990 exceeded \n120,000 tons. Signs of overfishing are emerging, as catches, catch per unit effort, and average \nsize  of  catch  of  some  species  of  shrimp,  pomphret,  hilsa,  and  barramundi  are  declining.  \nFisherfolk are unaware of overfishing, which they sometimes associate with the type of gear \nused. Generally, they believe that the fish are sent by Allah and he will provide these.  Fisherfolk \nmust understand that their direct action will reduce the supply of fish. \n17.  The  analysis  of  the  mangrove  shrimp  stocks  of  the  Indus  Delta  have  focused  on \nestimates of total catch and effort from grouped species taken by an offshore trawler. This \nassessment concluded that the shrimp resource was overexploited, and suggested ongoing \ncollection of catch, effort, and length and frequency data based on a defined sampling strategy. \nA  World  Bank  review  of  the  National  Conservation  Strategy  emphasized  that  not  many \nproposed  projects  addressed  Pakistan\u2019s  capture  fisheries.  An  Asian  Development  Bank \nFisheries Sector Study in 19878 found that a stock assessment had not been conducted within \nthe  marginal  mangrove  creek  and  estuarine  system.  Further,  this  study  stressed  that  the \nreduction in fish and shrimp stocks is real, foreseeable, and requires research.  \n18.  An Artemia salina (brine shrimp) culture industry has the potential for development, \nwhich would provide an excellent source of food for larvae, juvenile, and adult stages of fish.9 \nThis species is easy to grow, and has been used successfully in some countries as diet for \nfinfish and shellfish. It also has a market as food for aquaria species. \n19.  Marine mussels and oysters are known to be present in the mangrove swamps. Their \nyoung  stages  occur  naturally  as  floating  plankton  in  the  sea  water  of  the  creeks.  These \neventually attach to solid surfaces in the mangrove swamps, such as the roots of mangroves, \nand develop to maturity. The field culture of these shellfish has significant potential, as the \ntechniques are relatively simple and have been tested in other countries. Marine mussels and \noysters are a high-value catch on the international market. \n20.  Several species of marine crab are known to grow in the mangrove areas of the Sindh \ncoast. They are valuable sources of income for rural communities. Villagers collect the crabs as \nmature adults from wild populations in the mangrove creeks. Recent trials at Sandspit by the \nCentre of Excellence in Marine Biology, University of Karachi, have suggested that crab pond \nculture has high potential. Sited at the high tide level, the ponds are flushed with clean seawater \ntwice a month at spring high tides. In this work, the crabs are obtained as small animals from \nthe wild population and transferred to the ponds, where they can grow to a marketable size. The \nsame researchers also are working on the production of seed. \nD.   Bamboo, Reeds, and Salt-Tolerant Grasses \n21.  The coastal zone landward of high tide in Sindh becomes more arid in the inland areas. \nThe habitat is often termed coastal sabkha. Overall, the habitat is extremely arid with sparse \nnatural vegetation cover and low plant biodiversity. Soil conditions are very dry with a high salt \ncontent. Strong coastal winds and erratic periods of rain in the summer impose additional stress \n_________________ \n8 Asian Development Bank. 1987. Pakistan Fisheries Sector Study. Asian Development Bank.

The natural vegetation, which is highly adapted to the area, is able to grow in \nplaces that are very dry and salty. This natural vegetation is dominated by succulent perennials \nand perennial grasses, including more than 100 halophytic (salt-tolerant) species in 36 families. \nGrasses (including bamboos) dominate, and some sedges and succulent chenopods can be \nfound. Acacia (Acacia nilotica ssp. Indica: babool) and prosopsis (Prosopsis juliflora) are also \ncommon  in  certain  locations.  Some  of  the  halophytic  species  not  only  germinate  under \nconditions of high salinity, but also are viable for long periods in seawater. The seeds of some \nspecies germinate quickly, within hours in some cases, demonstrating the plants\u2019 adaptation to \nvery dry conditions and the sporadic input of brackish or salt water. \n22.  The local populations use the natural halophytic vegetation in the sabkha coastal zone \nfor building; fodder for domestic camels, buffalo, goats, and poultry; food; and in some cases \nmedicine. Local rural communities use the fruits of some species as food, and young leaves and \nshoots are used as cooked vegetables and in salads and pickles.10 The oil in some of the seeds \nis used for preparing soap and for producing candles. The seeds of Salvadora oleoides and \nSalvadora persica (Mustard tree or Toothbrush tree) contain 30%\u201340% fat, which is very useful \nfor  such  products.  Some  of  the  halophytic  species  also  are  used  to  stop  itching  (Salsola \nimbricata) and coughing (Salvadora oleoides), and to cure eye infections (Zygophyllum simplex) \nand stomach problems (Thespesia populnea).  Such plants, with demonstrated economic value,  \ncan be of great use for bio-reclamation of very saline soils where other plants will not grow.   \n23.  The halophyte plant group at the Department of Botany, University of Karachi, has \ndeveloped one of the more interesting potential tools for improving income generation of the \nlocal rural communities in these areas. This group has grown some halophytic grass species in \nexperimental field trials with communities on the Balochistan coast, using plots irrigated with \nbrackish water. The grass species have been tested as fodder for livestock. Animals prefer to \neat these grass species, and put on more weight compared with control animals not fed on the \ncultivated grasses. These grass species and related ones have potential for testing on the Sindh \ncoast in the coastal sabkha.   \nE.  Seaweed \n24.  Seaweed grows naturally in seawater between high tide and a depth of 10 meters in the \nsea. In Pakistan, they are common along the coast,11 growing on the seabed, on rocks and \nboulders, in mangrove swamps and creeks, and in the intertidal zone. Seaweed is not cultivated \nat a small rural community level or on a commercial scale in Pakistan at this time. \n26.  Seaweed  (or  macro-algae)  and  micro-algae  are  marine  plants,  and  the  primary \nproducers in marine food chains, especially in nearshore and inshore waters. Their importance \nas a source of food for a range of marine herbivores is paramount. They also contribute to food \nwebs, nutrient release, and detritus in the mangrove ecosystem. Seaweed is categorized into \nthree  major  groups:  green,  brown,  and  red.  All  are  present  along  the  Sindh  coastline, \npossessing potential economic importance as food, fodder, and fertilizer, as well as in the \npharmaceutical industry. Seaweed also has great export potential. \n \n_________________ \n10 Ali, Nasir, and Qaiser, eds. 1999. Flora of Pakistan. Karachi.University of Karachi; and Khan, Ajmal and Bilquees \nGul. 2002.

Farming of seaweed is practiced largely in five Asian countries: the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Japan, Republic of Korea, Philippines, and Taipei,China. The species used\u2014some of \nwhich are also present along the Pakistan coast\u2014include the red seaweed Porphyra, the brown \nseaweed Undaria and Laminaria, and the green seaweed Enteromorpha and Ulva. They are \nused as food and as a source of gelatin, agar, carrageenan, alginates, mannitol, and iodine. \nGoiter, for example, can be treated by using products from the red alga Porphyra, which is rich \nin  iodine.  In  Japan,  nori  (Porphyra)  has  been  cultivated  for  human  consumption  for  three \ncenturies, with a typical value of 35.6% protein in the dried form. Nori contributes $1 billion to \nthe Japanese economy (350,000 tons wet weight). \n \n28.  Many scientific studies have been conducted on seaweed species along the Sindh and \nBalochistan coast, including their identification and chemistry.12 The HEJ Institute of Chemistry \nand the Department of Botany, University of Karachi, have done much of this work, which \nincludes the role of seaweed as sources of antimicrobial and antifungal agents. However, no \nprograms are underway in Pakistan to develop seaweed farming. Technical expertise would be \navailable from People\u2019s Republic of China and Japan among other places.  \n \n29.  Coastal zone seaweed in Sindh could be utilized in two ways to enhance the living \nstandards of local rural communities. First, members of rural communities could harvest the \nnatural growth of seaweed. This will require an initial field survey to establish the extent of \nseaweed cover in the mangrove creeks and at the edge of the coastal zone near such villages \nas Keti Bandar. The technology is straightforward and can be undertaken from inshore fishing \nvessels.  Information  also  might  be  available  from  fisherfolk  in  the  communities.  Second, \nseaweed-farming technology could be introduced. This will require pilot-scale studies followed \nby longer-term seaweed farming programs in the mangrove creeks and related marine waters. \nThe  rural  coastal  communities  also  will  need  training.  Both  routes  potentially  could  make \nsignificant contributions to uplifting rural communities and generating income, especially for \nthose living in or close to the shoreline and mangrove swamps.

Small-Scale Initiatives \n \n  1.  Selection of Target Area and Schemes in Small-Scale Initiatives \n1.  No clear-cut criteria for selecting the geographical target area were found with National \nRural Support Programme (NRSP), although management indicated that the district government \ndesignates  union  councils  for  NRSP  entry.  The  use  of  well-being  ranking  or  similar  is  the \nsuggested mechanism for selecting areas under the Project. NRSP should first enter areas \nscoring poorly on well-being rankings in unions, villages, and settlements, particularly in coastal \nareas and near potential mangrove and crab or prawn pond sites. Final selection of the target \nareas should consider the need to have cost-effective and manageable clusters for project \nintervention.  \n \n2.  NRSP has a firmly established participatory process in place for identifying and selecting \ncommunity-initiated schemes. The division of roles between NRSP and the communities has \nalso has been laid out clearly. The current approach and processes need to be continued with \nsome  modifications.  NRSP  should  educate  the  community  organizations  on  criteria  for \nprioritization of the village-level schemes identified through participatory processes. The following \ncriteria are agreed: \n \n(i)  the potential of the scheme to satisfy practical and strategic gender needs of \nwomen and girls, \n(ii)  the potential to benefit the poorer and disadvantaged sections of the community, \n(iii)  the potential to create a sustainable medium- and longer-term impact on existing \npoverty and social inequality,  \n(iv)  not to have the potential to create adverse environmental impact, and \n(v)  community organizations must provide counterpart funds totaling at least 5% of \nthe scheme cost, of which 3% must be in cash to be set aside for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M).  \n \n2.   Establishing Integrity in Small-Scale Initiatives \n3.  NRSP has the basic elements of integrity systems and processes in place through its \ncommunity-oriented and transparent approach, such as: \n \n(i)  regular public meetings and reviews, \n(ii)  public signing of the agreement in the community,  \n(iii)  project register (book) at the community level, \n(iv)  use of market rates for works estimation, and \n(v)  formation and use of a community organization audit committee. \n \n4.  The  following  additional  measures  need  to  be  taken  to  strengthen  the  system  and \ncontinue the good practices:  \n \n(i)  Emphasis should be placed on NRSP staff and community organization managers \nusing the last project-related public meeting as a public audit of the work (quality, \nquantity, prices of materials, wage rates paid to the workers, and dissemination of \ninformation regarding who contributed what and why), and ways forward for the \n ", "Appendix 5        37\n \ncommunity.  NRSP  staff  must  understand  fully  the  importance  of  such  public \nmeetings in ensuring transparency. \n(ii)  Most of the NRSP staff do not understand fully the importance of the project \nregister as the anchor for transparency, and books are sometimes incomplete. \nNRSP engineers and social organizers and the community organizations need \nadditional orientation to understand and enforce the immediate information access \nand validation aspect of the project register. \n(iii)  Although NRSP uses local market rates for labor, work, and materials, it needs to \neducate the communities on the standard market practices. This includes such \narrangements as price concessions of around 10%\u201320% for cash payments of \nmaterials. Day labor payments should be recorded based on what is received, \nrather  than  quantifying  meals.  This  will  help  ensure  that  concessions  are \naccounted for properly and village elites do not pocket them for personal benefit. \n(iv)  Use of a Web site developed by the project management unit (PMU) to post \ninformation on all of its schemes in different villages implemented through the \nProject will add to the transparency of the processes and decisions. NRSP also \nshould  use  other  media  (local  radio,  posters,  and  religious  meetings)  to \ncommunicate  information  on  the  small-scale  initiatives  to  the  community. \nAdditionally,  the  NRSP  and  its  community  organizations  can  use  this  public \ninformation system to post any community concerns in the project areas, such as \nabsence of teachers from the school or bad conditions in a health post. The local \nNRSP office can print out the relevant Web pages in Sindhi, and post them in \nlocations in the area. \n(v)  NRSP engineering staff\u2019s awareness and insights into the practices of civil works \ncorruption needs to be strengthened. The schedule of work rates used by NRSP \nneeds serious review and revision, at least for some of the items, such as road \nbuilding through the use of bulldozers and rollers. NRSP also needs to inject a \nsense  of  advocacy  among  its  staff  against  corrupt  practices,  as  well  as  a \nheightened sense of awareness on the pitfalls of corruption.  \n \n  3.  Monitoring Indicators for Small-Scale Initiatives \n5.  The  following  are  some  indicators  suggested  for  use  in  project  monitoring,  and \nmilestones to be used by district project implementation unit (DPIU) and NRSP: \n \n(i)  the  number  of  project  registers  kept  in  complete  form  without  errors  by  the \ncommunity organizations; \n(ii)  percentage of villagers (women and men) who can accurately report the costs of \nthe project; \n(iii)  percentage of villagers (women and men) who attended the project completion \nmeeting; \n(iv)  percentage of villagers (women and men) who attended at least three public \nmeetings  organized  for  the  implementation  of  the  small-scale  initiative  in  the \nvillage; \n(v)  number  of  NRSP-supported  community  organizations  that  are  implementing \nprojects independently without technical support from NRSP; \n(vi)  total funds used by NRSP-facilitated initiatives; \n(vii)  percentage  of  projects  passing  a  final  quality,  price,  and  completion  status \ninspection by the DPIU and NRSP; and \n(viii)  percentage of projects in full operation and with quality maintained in the asset \nafter 2 years. \n ", " 38     Appendix 5 \n \nB.  Medium-Scale Initiatives \n1.  Identification and Selection of Medium-Scale Initiatives \n6.  The  community  areas  will  demand  medium-scale  initiatives  from  the  district  project \nimplementation  unit  (DPIU)  through  a  local  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  following  a \nprocess  that  meets  certain  prescribed  standards  for  transparency  and  participation.  These \ninclude (i) at least one public meeting attended by at least 60% of the beneficiary households in \nthe concerned area to discuss and plan the proposed project; (ii) verification by the DPIU of \nwhether the proposals received meet the prescribed minimum criteria; and (iii) prioritization and \nfinal selection of the proposed initiatives by a selection committee of five members, based on the \nfollowing transparent criteria:   \n(i)  potential to benefit the poorer and disadvantaged sections of the community, \nparticularly women; \n(ii)  potential to create a sustainable medium- and longer-term impact on the poverty, \nenvironment, and social inequality; \n(iii)  ability to incorporate measures to promote transparency and accountability in the \nimplementation of the interventions; and \n(iv)  ability of the beneficiaries to contribute 2% counterpart funds in cash or in kind. \n7.  The  Coastal  Development  Authority  (CDA)  director  general  will  chair  the  selection \ncommittee,  which  will  comprise  the  following  other  members:  (i)  additional  secretary, \nGovernment of Sindh (GoS) Works and Services Department; (ii) district coordination officer of \nThatta or Badin District (depending on the location of the application); (iii) representative from \none of the three NGOs on the project steering committee (PSC) by rotation; and (iv) a senior \nwoman representative from a local NGO working in the relevant district project area, or (if local \nNGOs cannot agree on a candidate) a representative from the district chapter of All Pakistan \nWomen\u2019s Association for either Thatta or Badin.  \n \n2.  Integrity Process for Medium-Scale Infrastructure \n8.  The NGO requesting the project on behalf of the community will ensure transparency and \naccountability of the processes. The NGO is required to use at least the following proven tools \nand mechanisms for ensuring transparency and accountability:  \n \n(i)  community-led transparent process of project identification and selection; \n(ii)  an independent project selection committee (para. 7); \n(iii)  complete project register of the type used by NRSP in all its civil infrastructure \nworks; \n(iv)  community review and reporting of the project, including (a) public awarding of \ncontract to winning bidder and oath-taking by officials, (b) midterm review and \nreporting, and (c) final review (public audit) and reporting; \n(v)  public  posting  of  project-related  information  on  Web  sites  and  public  bulletin \nboards in the project areas; and \n(vi)  a  committee  with  oversight  responsibilities  for  selection  of  contractors  for \nimplementation. \n \n3.  Monitoring Indicators for Medium-Scale Initiatives \n9.  The following indicators may be monitored for medium-scale initiatives: \n \n(i)  number of public meetings held regarding the project with participation of at least \n60% of the beneficiary households; \n ", "Appendix 5        39\n \n(ii)  number of bidders for each tender issued; \n(iii)  the difference between the prices quoted by the highest bidder and the lowest \nbidder; \n(iv)  the difference between the prices estimated by the government department and the \nlowest bidder (winning contractor); \n(v)  the difference between the work rates quoted by the winning bidder and the actual \nwork rate paid at the construction site; \n(vi)  the  number  of  project  registers  kept  in  complete  form  without  errors  by  the \ncommunity organizations; \n(vii)  percentage of villagers (women and men) who can accurately report the costs of the \nproject; \n(viii)  percentage of villagers (women and men) who attended the project completion \nmeeting;  \n(ix)  funds used by medium-scale initiatives; \n(x)  percentage  of  projects  passing  a  final  quality,  price,  and  completion  status \ninspection by DPIU and PMU; and \n(xi)  percentage of projects in full operation and with quality maintained in the asset after \n2 years. \n \nC.   Grievance Review Mechanism \n \n10.  To enhance governance in the planning and implementation of small- and medium-scale \ninitiatives, and to address key risks such as elite capture, the Project will establish a grievance \nreview mechanism. This will allow the project beneficiaries and the local stakeholders within the \nproject  areas  to  raise  complaints  concerning  the  planning,  construction,  operation,  or \nimplementation of the small- or medium-scale interventions. This Project, therefore, will have a \nhigher level of accountability to beneficiaries and interested stakeholders. Such measures also \nwill allow early identification and mitigation of project implementation issues.   \n \n11.  An  aggrieved  party  can  report  complaints  and  grievances  related  to  project \nimplementation, even anonymously, to the NRSP social organizer or a designated person from \nthe PMU. If the complaint is submitted to the NRSP social organizer, then it will be forwarded to \nthe designated person in the PMU for documentation and action as appropriate.  A list of \ngrievances and the status of the redress process will be placed on the project Web site and \nreported  back  to  the  complainant.  This  will  allow  the  aggrieved  party  to  track  progress  in \nredressing his or her grievances. Similar information will be posted on the community boards. In \naddition, the NRSP social organizers will report this information in regular community meetings. If \na person is unable to address the issue, he/she should bring the matter to the attention of the \ndirector general of CDA, who is required to seek proper redress to grievances. If the complainant \nis not satisfied with the results, she/he may appeal to the chairman of the PSC for further \nassistance. The specific mechanism will be developed within 6 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n ", "DETAILED COST ESTIMATES \nTable A6.1:  Expenditure Accounts Project Cost Summary \nAppendix 6   % of  4\n         0\n  Item        (PKR Million)  (US$ \u2018000)    Total     \n          Local  Foreign  Total  Local  Foreign  Total  Exchange  Costs   A\np\n  A.

Item  2  Methods  of  Implementation.  Every  community  organization  forms  three \ncommittees for projects: project committee (3\u20135 persons), audits committee (2 persons), and \noperations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  committee  (2  persons  from  the  project  management \ncommittee). The project committee manages the implementation of the initiative with technical, \nmanagerial, and social support from National Rural Support Programme (NRSP). NRSP and the \ncommunity organization are jointly responsible for financial management of the project. The \nNRSP engineer, social organizer, and manager review the projects for feasibility. The district \nproject implementation unit rural engineer and safeguards specialist periodically will spot-check \nto ensure the projects are being undertaken properly. Funds are released in tranches to the \nbank account of the community organization for joint release by the president and secretary of \nthe community organization and the NRSP area field engineer.   \n \n2.  Item 7 Method of Implementation. International Union for Conservation of Nature and \nNatural Resources (IUCN), NRSP, and the Sindh (Provincial) Forest and Wildlife Department \n(SFWD) will engage communities living near the planting areas that self-select to participate in \nmangrove  planting  and  establishment.  NRSP  will  assist  in  setting  up  the  community \norganizations,  facilitating  leadership,  minute-taking,  and  other  social  capital-building \narrangements. IUCN will arrange for community training in sustainable mangrove management, \nand in mangrove planting and tending techniques. SFWD will manage the physical nursery \nestablishment and mangrove planting processes, providing all necessary technical and logistical \nsupport for the processes, plus arrange standard and suitable payment for agreed services \n(nursery  tending,  planting,  monitoring  and  guarding,  infill  planting,  and  other  minor  works, \nincluding construction of walkways). As IUCN and SFWD have undertaken this type of activity \nfor many years in adjacent areas, rates and processes are well-known. The SFWD will arrange \ncommunity  policing  and  replanting.  IUCN  (with  NRSP  links)  will  provide  communities  with \ntraining and technical support on how to protect and use the mangrove areas sustainably for \nfodder, fuel, and fisheries production and sale. IUCN will mark out all areas by global positioning \nsystem to be placed in the Coastal Development Authority geographic information system; \nmonitor nursery, planting, infill, and maintenance processes; and report on results. \n  ", "52      Appendix 10 \nASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL RURAL SUPPORT PROGRAMME \n \n1.  As part of the Sindh Coastal Community Development Project, the government of Sindh \nanticipates  providing  a  blended,  results-based  contract  for  the  provision  of  community \norganization  and  household  income  generation,  and  small-scale  interventions  in  the  eight \ntalukas (subdistrict) of coastal Badin and Thatta. Over 6 years, a minimum of 1,388 community \norganizations  will  be  formed,  and  no  less  than  700  villages  will  undertake  small-scale \ninterventions. Based on lessons learned and an assessment of district-based nongovernment \norganizations (NGO) working in the project districts\u2014and given the need for rapid start-up to \nassist these communities\u2014the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) will be the sole \nsource for this contract. Alternative selection methods will be too time-consuming and inefficient, \nbecause of lack of capacity of district-based NGOs, as well as coordination, approach, and \nreporting  problems  arising  from  the  use  of  multiple  NGOs.  This  could  delay  start-up  and \npotentially create implementation problems. Accordingly, an assessment of the capacity and \nqualifications  of  the  NRSP  was  undertaken  to  justify  the  single-source  selection.  NRSP\u2019s \npresence in the two project districts, and its successful history of community development in 34 \ndistricts and 82 talukas throughout Pakistan, places it in a unique position to expand to the \nharsher coastal zone of Sindh. A more detailed assessment is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n2.  NRSP Establishment. In 1991, the Government supported the countrywide replication \nof the Rural Support Programme model, which culminated in the creation of the NRSP. In 1992, \nthe Government provided NRSP with a grant of PRs500 million to start operations. As other \nresources became available, particularly from development partners but also from provincial \ngovernments, NRSP expanded beyond the initial eight districts. Cost recovery from NRSP\u2019s \nmicrocredit program, which constitutes the largest portfolio of any microfinance organization in \nPakistan with 160,893 active loans totaling PRs1,779 million ($29.6 million), now provides a \nsignificant proportion of NRSP\u2019s operating funds. Rising contributions from donor agencies are \nthe main source for NRSP\u2019s expansion.  \n \n3.  Evidence of Impact. NRSP\u2019s performance was evaluated as part of a case study for the \n2004  Shanghai  Conference  on  Scaling  Up  Poverty  Reduction.  Membership  in  an  NRSP \ncommunity  organization  resulted  in  an  estimated  7.5%  higher  household  income  annually. \nSimilarly, NRSP estimates show that poverty levels were lower in member households (Khan \n2002). The United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-supported Pakistan National Human \nDevelopment Report 2003 states that (i) 68% of the NRSP respondents ate their fill daily, \n(ii) 68% ate better than before, (iii) 50% felt improvements in health, and (iv) 82% experienced a \nsustainable increase in income after accessing credit. A study of 35 rural water supply schemes \nin Punjab (Khan 1999) concluded that NRSP schemes were more cost-effective and had a \nhigher  success  rate  in  sustainable  service  delivery  than  schemes  undertaken  directly  by \nGovernment. A 1998 UNDP evaluation of NRSP observed: \u201cIn sum, the NRSP model is \u2026 \nhighly  responsive  to  community  motives  and  aspirations  within  the  context  of  community \nparticipation.  NRSP\u2019s  experiences  suggest  that  it  is  feasible  to  unlock  the  productive  and \nentrepreneurial potential of Pakistan\u2019s rural people.\u201d (UNDP 1998).  \n4.  Experience in the Project Districts. NRSP has been operating for 12 years in Badin \nand 6 years in Thatta. It has engaged in community mobilization, savings, and implementation \nof small-scale civil works in these areas.  \n \n \n ", "                                                                                     Appendix 10  53\nTable A10.1: Current National Rural Support Programme Areas in Thatta and Badin \nDistrict  Tehsil/Taluka  Field Unit \nBadin  Badin  Badin \n  Golarchi  Golarchi \n  Tando Bagho  Tando Bagho \n  Talhar  Talhar \n  Matli  Matli \nThatta   Thatta   Thatta \n  Sajawal   Sajawal \n  Mirpur Sakro  Mirpur Sakro \n  Mirpur Bathro  Mirpur Bathro \n \n  Sindh Coastal Community Development Project areas. \nSource:  National Rural Support Program records.  \n \n5.  NRSP has a regional office in Hyderabad, a district office in Badin, five field offices in \nBadin, and four in Thatta. Field offices are set up within 25 kilometers of a working area, with \ntwo social organizers, one engineer, and one credit officer, plus a driver and general support \nstaff. The current offices are too far from the project area to serve them. Thus, two offices,1 one \neach in Ghorabari and Jati, will be set up for the project. \n6.  The regional budget last year was about PRs80 million ($1.3 million). Infrastructure \ninvestments were PRs88.1 million for a 2.5-year phase, or about PRs35.2 million per year. The \nADB proposal is for expenditures of about $5.5 million over 6 years of operations, or PRs55 \nmillion a year, and about PRs80 million a year in small-scale interventions. This will increase the \noverall regional budget by 69% and the infrastructure budget by 229%, highlighting the need for \nsignificant staffing additions and management enhancements in the project area.  \n7.  Social  Mobilization  and  Small-Scale  Interventions.  Community  organization  and \nplanning will form the core activities under the Sindh Coastal Community Development Project \n(SCCDP).  NRSP  community  organizations  have  proven  successful  in  facilitating  the \nidentification  of  needs  by  villages,  and  in  arranging  for  demands  to  be  met  effectively  in \nparticipatory  ways.  Community  organization  members  and  their  households  currently  can \naccess services from NRSP, including training, microcredit, and support for small-scale civil \nworks interventions. NRSP also has put in place important sustainability measures, and is \nhelping community organizations to register as Citizen Community Boards in order to access \nfunding from district governments.  \nTable A10.2: Social Mobilization in Badin and Thatta:  \nCommunity Organizationsa and Savings \n \nItem  Badin  Thatta  Total \nCommunity  Organization  2,206.00  817.00  3,023.00 \nFormation \n       Men  1,654.00  486.00  2,140.00 \n       Women  432.00  199.00  631.00 \n       Mix  120.00  132.00  252.00 \n_________________ \n1 The budget provides for incremental staffing and costs for the regional and district offices assuming that the \nfollowing project will finance their establishment: ADB. 2002.

NRSP\u2019s experience in supporting and implementing community physical infrastructure is \nextensive. NRSP is the only organization operating in the area that has proven capacity to do \ncommunity mobilization and implementation of civil works at the proposed scale. In the Badin \nand Thatta area, 433 projects have been completed at an average grant of about PRs400,000. \nThese projects have benefited more than 24,000 households. Local community members are \ninvolved  in  the  entire  process  of  physical  infrastructure  schemes\u2014from  identification  and \nplanning to execution, monitoring, and maintenance. This creates a sense of ownership and \nresponsibility. Local community groups have contributed a significant amount of the project \ncosts, approaching 29% in both areas, mostly through labor.   \nTable A10.3: NRSP Community Physical Infrastructure in Thatta and Badin \n(as of 31 August 2006)a \n \nItem  Badin  Thatta  Total \nCompleted projects  322.00  111.00  433.00 \nTotal cost (PRs million)  84.357  14.29  98.647 \n       Donor share  60.936  11.326  72.26 \n       Community share  23.421  2.964  26.38 \na  These  numbers  refer  to  the  schemes  implemented  through  direct  input  by  NRSP.  In  addition  community \norganizations are helped to implement schemes through links with other agencies and credit.  \nSource: NRSP records. \n9.  Human Resources Capacity and Management. NRSP has strong mechanisms for \nHuman  Resource  (HR)  development,  implemented  through  NRSP\u2019s  Institute  of  Rural \nManagement (IRM). All staff participates in a 15-day induction program which includes field \ntime, and are subject to a 6-month probationary period. The main method of professional \nrecruitment is through their internship program, a 6-month program offered to Master\u2019s degree \ngraduates, which serves as an extended induction program, including classroom and field \ntraining. All interns go through general training, as well as specific and targeted modules, \ndepending on their position. In addition, staff undergo annual refresher trainings of 3\u20135 days. \nNRSP carries out annual performance evaluations for all staff. Performance is closely linked to \npromotions and salary increases. Currently, about 22% of staff are female, but only 8% at \nmanagement  level.  The  average  graduating  class  from  the  internship  program  has  40% \nfemales. \n10.  NRSP  is  struggling  with  high  attrition  rates,  mainly  due  to  competition  from  other \norganizations and projects that offer better remuneration packages. However, the organization \nis likely to be able to employ highly trained and qualified staff to implement the SCCDP. The \nstrategy to address large staffing needs and expansion will include (i) using the internship \nprogram as the main recruitment mechanism, and providing retention bonuses for women; and \n(ii) dividing the experienced staff in two, with half the group working under SCCDP with newly \nrecruited staff. NRSP will be able to expand its current staff in the project area by an estimated \n4-5 times. This means that management capacity will have to be upgraded to supervise this \nexpanded program. \n \n11.  Budgeting  and  Financial  Management.  Strong  and  transparent  budgeting  and \nfinancial  management  mechanisms  are  in  place.  The  Finance  and  Accounts  Department \n ", "                                                                                     Appendix 10  55\nmaintains the central treasury of NRSP. As such, it is responsible for overall cash inflows and \noutflows, utilization and management of funds, consolidation of accounts, budget preparation, \nand reviewing the effectiveness of internal financial controls. An Internal Audit department was \nestablished in 2005 to conduct routine internal audits and investigations. External auditors also \naudit each district office, regional office, head office, IRM, and donor-funded projects at least \nonce a year. The World Bank, which has certified NRSP financial management systems since \n2001, found their audit and management letters acceptable. \n12.  Management Information Systems and Strategic Planning. NRSP has established \nsophisticated management information systems (MIS) with clear sets of management indicators \nthat  it  tracks  regularly  in  Microsoft  Access.  Data  recording  begins  with  the  community \norganizations, which record all details of activities, including minutes of meetings, resolutions, \nand attendance rates. The field units collect data about every community organization, such as \n(i) number of members, (ii) savings, (iii) training courses, (iv) microcredit provided and repaid, \n(v) infrastructure projects implemented, and (vi) funds released. Data collected in the field units \nare  submitted  to  the  regional  offices,  where  it  is  verified  and  consolidated  into  a  monthly \nprogress report (MPR). The regional MPRs and the sector data from the various departments \nare  consolidated  into  a  single  monthly  program  update  at  the  Monitoring,  Evaluation  and \nResearch (MER) unit  at the head office. The MER unit  also consolidates information and \nprovides trend analyses for the biannual program management meeting, where all districts are \nrepresented. These data and reports are used to identify policies and strategies. While the \norganization does not have a separate policy unit, a committee is appointed to develop policies \nas needed.  \n13.  Other Expansion Plans.  The ADB-funded Sindh Rural Development Project recently \nselected NRSP as the sole source provider of similar services in four districts of Sindh, including \nBadin and Thatta. The relevant project officers are working closely to ensure consistency and \nresource-sharing, as well as to not overburden NRSP. Given the expected level of engagement \nof both projects, (approximately $46 million over 5\u20136 years), NRSP capacity will be stretched. \nHowever, the achievement of project objectives is strongly likely. NRSP senior management will \nhave to address additional expansion and/or development of a new product line with great \ncaution, and the two ADB project teams will need very close coordination. \n14.   Summary of Assessment Findings. NRSP possesses the following characteristics \nnecessary for successful implementation of the community development component: \n(i)  experience and success in participatory community organization and household \nincome-generating activities in the two districts, including in the coastal areas; \n(ii)  experience in implementing small infrastructure schemes; \n(iii)  ability to provide or mobilize links to microcredit for households; \n(iv)  demonstrated institutional capacity to manage and handle reporting and financial \nrequirements for a project of this size and scope; \n(v)  the size and stability to handle the implementation of the project and expansion \nin the area; \n(vi)  understanding of and support from local communities; \n(vii)  clear,  feasible  objectives  and  work  plans  that  have  the  support  of  the \norganization\u2019s staff and main constituencies; \n(viii)  an HR management system that sets forth clear expectations of staff, appraises \nstaff based on their performance, and develops staff\u2019s skills; \n(ix)  a system for managing community workers, including community volunteers; \n(x)  an MIS that provides managers with essential information on a timely basis; and \n(xi)  a financial management system that safeguards the integrity of resources. \n \n  ", "Appendix 11             \n56 \nSUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE:  \nCONSULTING SERVICES AND PACKAGES \n \n1.
