A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated  to  the  Board  and  posted  on  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) website on 14 April 2008. \n \nThe  Tianjin  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  Power  Plant \nProject involves constructing and operating a coal-fired integrated \ngasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC)  power  plant  with  250 \nmegawatt  capacity  in  Tianjin  Harbor  Industrial  Park  in  the  Binhai \nNew  Area  of  Tianjin  city.  This  will  be  the  first  IGCC  clean  coal \nproject  in  the  PRC,  using  the  most  efficient  and  least-polluting \ntechnology currently available commercially. It will also be the first \nIGCC  power  plant  in  the  developing  Asia.  On  completion,  the \nplant  will  generate  1,470  gigawatt-hours  of  electricity  annually, \nwhich will be sold to the Northern China Grid Company Ltd. using \na  220  kilovolt  interconnecting  transmission  line  to  an  existing \nsubstation in the industrial park.  \n \nThe Project is consistent with the priority of the Government of the \nPRC  to  implement  a  coal-fired  power  plant  with  near-zero \nemissions  by  2015  under  its  flagship  clean  coal  program\u2014\nGreenGen\u2014announced  in  2005.  The  Project  is  a  cornerstone  of \nthe  critical  first  phase  of  the  GreenGen  program.  In  the  second \nphase,  a  scaled-up  IGCC  plant  fitted  with  pilot-scale  carbon \ncapture  and  storage  (CCS)  is  expected  by  2013,  and  the  third \nphase  is  expected  to  provide  a  coal-fired  power  plant  with  near-\nzero  emissions  by  2015.  CCS  is  included  in  all  climate  change-\nmitigation \nthe  United  Nation's \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International \nEnergy  Agency.  Various  international  studies  have  found  IGCC \npower  plants  with  CCS  to  be  the  least-cost  option  to  cut  carbon \ndioxide  (CO2)  emissions  from  coal-fired  power  plants  by  up  to \n90%.  By  successfully  demonstrating  the  advantages  of  IGCC \ntechnology, the Project will reinforce confidence in the viability of \nthis  technology  and  enable  the  timely  implementation  of  the \nensuing phases of the GreenGen program.  \n \nRelevant  approvals  for  the  construction  are  in  place.  Project  \ncompletion  is expected by 30 June 2012.  \n\nstrategies  proposed  by \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification  \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n\nthe \n\ntotal  electricity \n\nThe PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. Coal \nproduction has increased from 0.98 billion tons (t) in 2000 to 2.74 \nbillion  t  in  2008,  or  more  than  48%  of  global  production.  In  the \nPRC,  electricity  is  produced  predominantly  from  coal,  which \nin  2008.  Electricity \ngenerated  81%  of \ngeneration  is  the  largest  single  consumer  of  coal.  It  consumed \n1.34  billion  t  (49%)  of  the  coal  produced  in  2008,  with  serious \nenvironmental  problems  and  poor  air  quality  caused  by  related \nemissions\u201450%  of  the  nation\u2019s  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  emissions, \n36%  of  its  nitrogen  oxide  (NOX)  emissions,  and  39%  of  its  CO2 \nemissions.  Acid  rain  caused  primarily  by  SO2  and  NOx  falls  on \none-third  of  the  country  and  45%  of  its  farmland.  The  rapid \nincrease  in  coal  consumption  has  triggered  a  surge  in  emissions \nof  CO2\u2014a  major  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  and  cause  of  global \nclimate change.  \n \nThe  Government  is  actively  improving  energy  efficiency  and \nshifting  to  non-carbon  and  other  cleaner  energy  sources  to \nimprove  the  country\u2019s  environment  and  help  mitigate  global \nclimate  change.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law,  enacted  in  2006, \nbrought unprecedented growth in wind, solar, and biomass power \ngeneration. Carbon-free nuclear power is expected to grow many \nfolds. The PRC already has the largest hydropower capacity in the \nworld,  which  is  expected  to  grow  substantially.  Despite  efforts  to \nchange  the  energy  mix,  coal  is  expected  to  remain  dominant  in \nelectricity production in the near future.  \n \nTo improve the efficiency of and reduce emissions from coal-fired \npower  plants,  the  PRC  is  (i)  rapidly  closing  small,  inefficient \nplants,  as  indicated  by  the  closing  of  54  gigawatts  of  such \ncapacity \nthe  past  3  years  alone;  (ii)  constructing  new \nsupercritical  and  ultra-supercritical  (USC)  plants  with  advanced \ninternational \ntechnology \nstandards;  and  (iii)  accelerating  the  application  of  flue  gas  de-\nsulfurization.  The  development  of  coal-fired  IGCC  power  plants \nhas  been  slow,  though  they  can  offer  4%\u20135%  higher  efficiency \nthan  USC  plants.  So  far,  no  industrial-scale  IGCC  plant  is \nthe  PRC.  Higher  capital  and,  operation  and \noperating \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  (affecting  electricity \ntariffs),  and \ntechnology  risks  are  cited  as  key  barriers.  IGCC  technology  is, \nhowever, gaining momentum in part because of the opportunity of \ncombining it with CCS to cut emissions drastically.  \n \nThe  Project  will  demonstrate  a  key  enabling  technology  with \npotential  for  large  GHG  emission  reductions  from  coal  usage  in \nthe  largest  coal-consuming  country  in  the  world.  ADB  project \nsupport  will  provide  additional  technical  due  diligence  and  help \nmitigate  associated  risks,  strengthen  compliance  with  safeguard \npolicies,  and  thereby  establish  appropriate  benchmarks  and \nstandards \nsuccessful \nimplementation  of  the  Project will lead to scaled-up IGCC power \n\nthat  offer  efficiency  comparable \n\nprojects.  The \n\nfuture \n\nIGCC \n\nfor \n\nto \n\nin \n\nin \n\n\fiii \n\nto \n\ninnovative  support \n\nplants and trigger the next phases of the GreeGen program, with \nthe  potential  for  very  large  reductions  in  GHG  emissions  from \ncoal-fired power plants in PRC.   \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  reduced  GHG  emissions  from \ncoal-fired  power  plants.  The  outcome  will  be  expanded \ndeployment of IGCC plants. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $419.59 million, \ninclusive of physical and price contingencies ($22.50 million) and \nfinancial charges during development ($22.10 million).  \n \nA  loan  of  $135  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 26-year term, including \na grace period of 6 years. The long grace period of 6 years, when \ncompared with a 3-year construction period, is proposed as part of \nthe \nthis  project  demonstrating  new \ntechnology  during  its  initial  years  of  operation.  The  loan  will  be \nsubject  to  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  the  applicable  commitment  charge, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and \nproject  agreements.  ADB  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of  currency \nand interest rate swaps during the financing period, in accordance \nwith relevant loan regulations and loan and project agreements.  \n \nADB's  Climate  Change  Fund  (CCF)  will  provide  a  grant  of  $5 \nmillion to finance some key components to mitigate risk.  \n \nThe Borrower of ADB loan will be the PRC. Loan proceeds will be \nrelent  by  the  Borrower  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  the \nExport-Import Bank of China (EXIM Bank) on the same terms and \nconditions  as  the  loan  between  ADB  and  the  PRC.  EXIM  Bank \nwill, in turn, onlend these loan proceeds to China Huaneng Group \n(CHNG)  on  similar  loan  terms  as  the  EXIM  Bank  loan  and \nadditionally  include  a  standard  administration  fee  of  0.15%  for \nproviding these onlending services. CHNG, through an onlending \nagreement,  will  then  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  Greengen \nCompany  Ltd  (Greengen),  who  in  turn  will  onlend  it  to  Huaneng \nTianjin IGCC Company Ltd. (HTICL) as the implementing agency \n(IA)  under  a  subsequent  onlending  agreement,  which  again  will \nincorporate the same terms and conditions as CHNG's agreement \nwith EXIM Bank. HTICL shall bear the risk of currency and interest \nrate fluctuation. \n \n \n31 December 2012 \n31 December 2015 \n \n30 June 2012 (Loan)  \n30 June 2015 (Grant) \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n(Loan) \n(Grant) \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n\fiv \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n \n\nactively \n\nentity,  Greengen  management \n\nThe  EXIM  Bank  acts  as  the  principal  onlending  agency.  CHNG \nwill be the Executing Agency (EA). CHNG is the managing partner \nof  Greengen,  which  established  the  project  company  HTICL  in \nTianjin  for  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the \npower  plant.  HTICL  was  registered  as  a  limited  liability  company \nunder  PRC  law  in  November  2008.  While  HTICL  is  a  separate \nlegal \nprovides \nmanagement  oversight  to  HTICL.  A  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU)  established  in  HTICL  will  regularly  monitor  implementation \nprogress.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager \nresponsible for day to day implementation and the preparation of \nprogress  reports.  The  PIU  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of \ninternational and national consultants to enhance its capacity with \nregard  to  safeguard  compliance  and  for  project  management, \nmonitoring, and reporting.  \n \nChina Huaneng Group  \n \nProject procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nAdvance contracting for the Project was approved in August 2008. \nCHNG  and  HTICL  have  requested  retroactive  financing  for  the \nprocurement  of  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services.  The \namount  to  be  retroactively  financed  will  not  exceed  20%  of  the \nloan  amount  and  will  be  effective  for  reasonable  expenditures \nincurred before loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months \nbefore the signing date of the loan agreement. \n \nConsulting  services  for  16  person-months\u20144  international  and  \n12  national\u2014will  be  provided  to  assist  HTICL  with  the  Project's \nimplementation, especially regarding compliance with safeguards, \nand \nin  project  management,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  All \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  viable  and  economically  attractive.  The \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  is  6.4%,  which  is  higher  than  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.7%.  The  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  is  16.5%,  higher  than  the  ADB  minimum  rate  of \n12%. Sensitivity tests and risk analysis show that the Project will \nbe  economically  and  financially  viable  even  under  a  combination \nof adverse scenarios. Potential carbon offset revenues under the \nClean  Development  Mechanism  will  further  improve  the  financial \nand economic benefits from the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  demonstrate  an  innovative  and  advanced  clean \ncoal  IGCC  technology  that  will  be  tested  for  the  first  time  in  the \nPRC. The Project will have significant environmental benefits with \nreduced emissions of major air pollutants like SO2, NOx, and total \nsuspended  particulates  (TSP) as  compared with a  conventional \n\n\fv \n\npower  plant.  The  estimated  annual  emissions  avoided  by  the \nProject are 43 t of TSP, 1,237 t of SO2, and 3,325 t of NOx. The \nProject will reduce annual coal consumption by 134,000 t and CO2 \nemissions  by  372,000  t,  with  associated  global  climate  benefits. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  use  35%  less  cooling  water  and \ngenerate significantly less solid waste than a conventional plant.    \n \nThe Project has acquired 20 hectares of land reclaimed from the \nBohai  Sea  in  an  existing  industrial  park  and  therefore  does  not \nentail  any  resettlement.  Based  on  ADB's  safeguard  policies,  it  is \ncategory  C  in  terms  of  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeople  impacts.  The  Project  will  provide  indirect  social  benefits \nthrough  improved  air  quality  in  the  project  area.  During  project \nconstruction, the peak number of workers may reach 1,000.  \n \nProject  implementation  carries  risks  inherent  in  any  project \ndemonstrating  an  advanced  technology  for  the  first  time  in  a  \ncountry. While all the major components of the Project have been \npilot  tested  or  established  commercially  and  are  in  successful \noperation  in  the  PRC,  these  components  have  not  yet  been \ncombined  in  a  reliable  industrial-sized  IGCC  power  plant.  This \nfirst-of-a-kind  risk  exists  in  this  demonstration  project,  especially \nduring  the  first  2  years  of  operation.  The  risk  is  substantially \nreduced  with  the  help  of  a  $5  million  grant  from  ADB's  CCF  that \nwill  sponsor  the  assistance  of  the  coal  gasifier  and  gas  turbine \nsuppliers  in  O&M  for  the  initial  2  years.  The  suppliers'  direct \nsupervision  and  support  during  this  critical  phase,  financed \nthrough the grant, will (i) provide enhanced technical expertise at \nshort  notice;  (ii)  help  quickly  diagnose  problems;  and  (iii) \nstrengthen the quality of O&M, which will help the Project quickly \nstabilize at its designed performance level. \n \nThe  major  change  in  an  IGCC  power  plant  compared  with  a \nconventional  plant  is  the  introduction  of  coal  gasification.  Coal \ngasification  is  a  mature  technology  widely  used  in  chemical \nindustries  in  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  use  a  domestically \ndeveloped  coal  gasifier,  which  is  a  scaled-up  version  of  a \nprototype  that  was  extensively  tested  on  the  same  coal  type.  To \nfurther mitigate risks associated with the reliability of the installed \ncoal  gasifier,  the  Project  will  have  interconnection  with  two \nsimilarly  sized  imported  coal  gasifiers  that  are  installed  in  a \nchemical  factory  next  to  the  project  site.  This  connection  will \nprovide  backup  in  case  the  gasifier  breaks  down,  thus  ensuring \nthe reliability of electricity supply from the Project.  \n \nProject  implementation  risks  are  minimal.  It  will  be  implemented \nby a very experienced and capable group of large power and coal \ncompanies,  with  strong  support  from  the  Government.  The  EA, \ndesign  institutes,  and  key  suppliers  have  extensive  experience \nand  expertise  in  designing,   constructing,  and  managing  large \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGrant Assistance  \n\ncoal-fired  power  plants.  CHNG,  Greengen  and  HTICL  have \nundertaken  an  extensive  recruitment  and  training  program  for \nengineers and operators with chemical engineering background to \ncomplement its extensive thermal power plant expertise. Key staff \nhas  been  trained  on  the  O&M  of  a  similar  IGCC  power  plant  in \nSpain.  The  trained  staff  will  improve  the  sustainability  of  the \nProject and minimize risks. \n \nElectricity tariffs in the PRC are regulated and set nationally by the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC).  As  this \nis  the  first  IGCC  power  plant,  the  cost  estimates  and  proposed \ntariff  were  rigorously  reviewed  during  NDRC\u2019s  approval  of  the \nfeasibility  report.  The  Project  is  financially  viable  at  the  tariff  of \nCNY0.56/kilowatt-hour  proposed  in  the  feasibility  report.  The \nelectricity tariff for the Project will be announced by NDRC only at \nproject  completion.  Since  NDRC  has  already  reviewed  and \napproved  the  feasibility  report,  the  risk  of  any  tariff  lower  than  in \nthe feasibility report is minimal.   \n \nGrant  assistance  is  proposed  from  CCF  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent  of  $5  million.  The  grant  will  be  utilized  for  the  (i)  coal \ngasifier\u2019s and gas turbines\u2019 long-term maintenance contracts with \ntheir  respective  suppliers,  (ii)  civil  work  contract  associated  with \nthe  air  separation  unit  of  the  chemical  island  plants,  and  (iii) \nrecruitment  of  international  and  national  consultants  to  supervise \nthe  Project's \nimplementation.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nPerformance Indicators and Analysis   \n\nA. \n\n2. \nThe  PRC  has  sustained  impressive  economic  growth  averaging  9.5%  for  the  past  2 \ndecades. Compared with 2000, its gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to double by 2010 \nand  quadruple  by  2020.  The  PRC's  energy  consumption  increased  to  2.85  billion  tons  (t)  of \nstandard  coal  equivalent  by  end-2008,  about  20%  of  global  energy  consumption  and  121% \nhigher  than  the  1.29  billion  t  of  standard  coal  equivalent  consumed  in  2000. 1  Given  the \nprojected  growth  trajectory  and  relatively  low  per  capita  energy  consumption  of  0.72  t  of  oil \nequivalent (toe) per annum, the PRC's demand for energy is expected to increase rapidly. Coal \nis the dominant source of primary energy, contributing 70% in 2008, which is significantly higher \nthan the world average of 26%.2  \n \nThe  PRC  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  coal  producer  and  consumer,  as  well  as  a  net  energy \n3. \nimporter,  mainly  of  oil  and  gas.  In  2008,  crude  oil  imports  were  more  than  178  million  t.  The \nPRC's  reliance  on  imported  oil  has  now  increased  to  more  than  50%  of  total  oil consumption. \nThe  consistently  increasing  demand  for  energy  has  impacted  upon  energy  security  and  may \nbecome a barrier to sustained economic growth.3 A key priority in the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) \n2006\u20132010 is to lower energy intensity by 20%.4 At the end of 2008, energy intensity had fallen \nby  9%  compared  with  2005.5 By  international  standards,  energy  intensity  in  the  PRC  is  still \nrelatively high at about 0.92 toe, compared with 0.21 toe for the United States and 0.15 toe for \nJapan.  \n \n4. \nThe rapid pace of economic growth has created strong demand for electricity. Per capita \nelectricity consumption increased from 993 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2000 to 2,650 kWh in 2008.6 \nAfter  the  United  States,  the  PRC  has  the  second-largest  electricity  industry  in  the  world.  Both \ninstalled  generation  capacity  and  actual  electricity  generation  increased  at  an  annual  average \nrate of more than 8% over the past 2 decades. Since 2001, electricity demand has increased at \nan  average  rate  of  more  than  13%.  This  increase  caused  serious  power  shortages  in  many \nareas of the PRC, which were overcome with an accelerated program of adding more capacity. \nTotal installed capacity has now reached 792.5 gigawatts (GW), and electricity generation has \nincreased  to  3,433  terawatt-hours  (TWh).  The  current  growth  trajectory  has  installed  capacity \nreaching more than 1,000 GW by 2012.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  of  China.  2009.  Statistical  Communiqu\u00e9  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  on  the \n\n2008 National Economic and Social Development. Beijing.   \n\n2  All PRC energy data in this document were taken from the National Bureau of Statistics of China unless otherwise \n\nnoted; international data is generally based on International Energy Agency data unless otherwise noted. \n\n3  The global financial crisis slowed energy demand growth in 2008 to a moderate increase of 5%. \n4  Energy intensity is the amount of primary energy consumed per $1,000 of GDP. \n5  In 2008 alone, energy intensity fell by 4.6%. During the first half of 2009, a further reduction of 3% was reported. \n\nThese trends mean the PRC is expected to meet its 11th FYP target of 20% reduction by 2010.    \n\n6  Annual per capita electricity consumption in the PRC of 2,650 kWh was still about a quarter of the 10,000 kWh in \n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2008. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n5. \nIn  the  PRC,  electricity  is  produced  predominantly  by  coal,  which  is  the  most  carbon-\nintensive  fossil  fuel.7 In  2008,  coal-fired  power  plants  produced  81%  of  total  electricity.  Coal \nproduction increased from 0.98 billion t in 2000 to 2.74 billion t in 2008, more than 48% of world \nproduction.  The  electricity  sector  is  the  largest  consumer  of  coal.  It  consumed  1.34  billion  t \n(49%)  of  the  coal  produced  in  2008,  which  has  caused  serious  environmental  problems.  Coal \nconsumption is the major cause of poor air quality. The electricity sector now produces 50% of \nthe nation\u2019s sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, 36% of its nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions, and 39% \nof its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Acid rain caused primarily by SO2 and NOx falls on one \nthird of the country and 45% of its farmland. In 2008, among 519 PRC cities with monitored air \nquality, only 399 met acceptable air quality (national class II) standards. The rapid increase in \ncoal consumption has triggered a surge in emissions of CO2\u2014a major greenhouse gas (GHG).8 \nAs per the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 20099 the PRC is expected \nto add more than 1,000 GW of new capacity by 2030, of which 70% will be coal-fired. Most of \nthis new capacity is expected before 2020.  \n \n6. \nA  more  diversified  energy  mix  with  a  higher  proportion  of  carbon-free  renewable \nsources,  nuclear  power,  and  low-carbon  fossil  fuel  such  as  natural  gas  is  being  actively \npursued.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law,  enacted  in  2006,  provides  financial  incentives  and \nregulations to accelerate the increased use of renewable energy resources such as wind, solar \nenergy, and biomass. This led to unprecedented growth in wind power capacity within the first 3 \nyears  (2006\u20132008)  of  the  11th  FYP.  The  PRC  now  has  12  GW  of  wind  power  capacity, \ncompared  with  less  than  1  GW  at  end-2005.  Solar  power  development  is  expected  to  reach      \n2  GW  by  2011.  The  11th  FYP  also  targets  5.5  GW  of  biomass  power  development.  The \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  has  set  the  goal  to  achieve  15%  of  electricity  generation  from \nrenewable energy sources by 2020 in its renewable energy development plans, promulgated in \nAugust 2007. The current growth momentum of renewable energy is expected to continue and \nmay achieve an even higher target.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints \n\nThe  PRC  quadrupled  its  GDP  during  1980\u20132000,  but  its  energy  consumption  only \n7. \ndoubled. The average energy elasticity of the GDP10 was 0.47. Since 2002, it increased sharply, \npeaking at about 1.6 in 2004, and declined to 0.7 in 2007. The consistently high average energy \nelasticity  of  GDP  of  about  0.95  during  2001\u20132007  has  led,  however,  to  large  energy  imports \n(para.  3)  with  repercussions  for  energy  security.  To  achieve  the  target  of  quadrupling  the \neconomy  while only doubling energy use between  2000 and 2020, energy elasticity has to be \nbrought down and maintained at below 0.3 over the next 12 years\u2014a very formidable challenge. \nTighter  regulations  and  the  right  incentives  are  required  to  further  lower  energy  intensity. \nInvestment in energy efficiency needs to increase substantially to achieve this target.11  \n \n8. \nThe  surge  in  new  generation  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  electricity \nmaterialized  in  260  GW  of  new  power  plant  capacity  in  the  3-year  period  2006\u20132008,  an \n\n                                                 \n7  Commercial coal has a carbon content of at least 70%; natural gas is almost half as carbon-intensive as coal.  \n8  As per the United Nations IPCC, GHGs are primarily responsible for global climate change. In the PRC, per capita \nGHG  emissions  are  still  small  compared  with  those  of  OECD  countries,  but  the  PRC  is  now  the  largest  GHG \nemitter. \n\n9  International Energy Agency. 2008. World Energy Outlook 2008. Paris. \n10 Energy elasticity of GDP is the ratio of the rate of growth in energy consumption to the rate of growth of GDP. \n11 Energy efficiency is the ratio of energy consumption per unit of output, e.g., grams of standard coal equivalent per \n\nkWh of electricity generated in a coal-fired power plant. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ntheir \n\ntechnologies \n\nlocal,  regional,  and  global \n\nincremental  CO2  emissions  and \n\nincrease  of  more  than  50%  over  the  installed  capacity  of  508  GW  in  2005.  While  large \nrenewable non-hydro energy capacity was added during this period (para. 6), 217 GW of new \ncoal-fired  generation  capacity  was  installed  during  the  same  period.  The  current  growth \ntrajectory of coal use for power plants is environmentally unsustainable. The rapid increase in \ncoal consumption, by more than 250% in the past 6 years, raises serious concerns about SO2, \nNOX,  and \nimpacts. \nEnvironmental  problems  are  aggravated  as  large  quantities  of  waste  coal  accumulate  near \npitheads.12  \n \nImproved  energy  efficiency  in  electricity  generation  through  advanced  coal-fired  power \n9. \nplants is a key priority for lowering emissions and improving energy security. A high percentage \nof  new  coal-fired  power-generating  units  are\u2014large  from  300  megawatts  (MW)  up  to  1  GW\u2014\nwith  supercritical  and  ultra-supercritical  (USC) \nthat  provide  much  higher \nefficiency.13 During 2006\u20132008, about 54 GW of old and inefficient coal-fired generators smaller \nthan  100  MW  were  closed,  and  the  average  efficiency  of  coal-fired  power  plants  improved  to \n340  grams  of  standard  coal/kWh  from  370  grams/kWh,  avoiding  160  million  t  of  coal  usage \nduring this period. In general, the new USC plants have efficiencies on a par with or higher than \ninternational  standards,  but  average  plant  efficiencies  in  the  PRC  are  still  much  lower  than \ninternational  standards  because  of  the  country\u2019s  many  old  and  inefficient  power  plants.  With \nmore  supercritical  and  USC  plants,  average  efficiency  will  gradually  improve.  It  is  still  unlikely \nthat coal consumption or emissions will drop, as many new coal-fired power plants will continue \nto  come  online.  A  technology  change  is  therefore  essential  in  coal-fired  power  plants  to \ndecouple high coal usage from CO2 emissions.      \n \nThe  internationally  available  and  more  advanced  clean  coal  technologies 14  such  as \n10. \nIGCC,  which  potentially  offer  even  higher  efficiency  and  far  superior  emission  performances \nthan  advanced  supercritical  and  USC  plants,  are  not  currently  installed  in  the  PRC.  IGCC \ntechnology  turns  coal  into  synthesis  gas  (syngas).  It  then  removes  impurities  from  the  syngas \nbefore it is combusted. This reduces emissions of SO2 and NOx by almost 99%. It also brings \n4%\u20135% higher efficiency compared with supercritical plants.15 The higher costs of IGCC plants \nand  perceived  technology  risks  from  complex  design  have  been  major  barriers  to  its  larger \nuptake.16 On  their  own,  IGCC  power  plants  offer  only  limited  CO2  emission  reductions  from \nhigher  efficiency.  But  the  emergence  of  technology  to  separate,  capture,  transport,  and  store \nCO2\u2014generally referred to as CO2 capture and storage (CCS)\u2014has provided renewed impetus \nfor  the  rapid  adoption  of  IGCC  technologies.17 Various  international  studies  have  found  IGCC \npower plants with CCS to be the least-cost option to cut CO2 emissions from coal-fired power \n\n                                                 \n12 Estimated  to  be  about  300  million  t  annually  by  the  study  conducted  under  technical  assistance  funded  by  the \nAsian  Development  Bank:  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Waste  Coal \nUtilization Study. Manila (TA 4389). \n\n13 The average efficiency of supercritical  and  USC plants is  in the range  of 40%  or more  compared to the average \nefficiency of below 30% from subcritical. A 1% efficiency improvement in the PRC's current generation of coal-fired \npower plants would avoid 13 million t of coal usage and 20 million t of CO2 emissions per annum.   \n\n14 Clean coal is an umbrella term widely used in the industry to describe technologies that reduce the environmental \nimpacts  of  coal-fired  power  plants.  Historically,  the  aim  was  to  reduce  SO2  and  particulates,  but,  considering  the \nimpacts  on  global  climate  change  from  CO2  emissions,  clean  coal  technologies  also  refer  to  technologies  that \nreduce CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants.    \n\n15 The Tianjin IGCC project's designed standard coal consumption rate is 274 grams per kWh of electricity produced, \n\nwhich is better than the average of 285 grams per kWh in USC plants.    \n\n16 The IGCC power plants costs about 80% higher than USC plants. The complexity in design is primarily due to the \n\ngasification of coal and cleaning of the syngas.   \n\n17 Most of the seven current IGCC plants (aggregate 1.5 GW) were built in the late 1990s and proved their efficiency \nand emissions benefits, but the uptake  was slow thereafter until about 2007,  when many IGCC plants (about 5.5 \nGW) were announced in Europe and the United States, especially in conjunction with CCS.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nplants by up to 90%.18 Appendix 2 provides more details on IGCC and CCS technologies.  \n \n11. \nCCS  involves  capturing  CO2  from  coal-fired  power  plants  either  before  combustion \n(IGCC plants) or after combustion (supercritical or USC plants) and long-term storage in deep \ngeological  formations  such  as  depleted  oil  and  gas  wells.  According  to  an  IEA  assessment, \nCCS presents the most promising GHG mitigation for coal-fired electricity generation.19 It is part \nof all climate change-mitigation strategies considered by IEA and the Intergovernmental Panel \non  Climate  Change  (IPCC).  To  date,  there  is  no  industrial-scale  coal-fired  power  plant  with \nCCS.  However,  CCS  has  been  used  successfully  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  for  many  years. \nCCS  is  particularly  relevant  for  a  large  coal-based  economy  like  PRC  to  decouple  its  growing \nenergy  needs  from  rising  CO2  emissions,  a  critical  factor  to  lower  the  carbon  intensity  of  the \neconomy.20  \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities  \n\n \n12. \nTo  recognize  the  central  role  of  coal  in  long-term  energy  security,  and  to  ensure  the \nenvironmental sustainability of rapidly increasing coal-fired generation capacity, the Government \nannounced the GreenGen program in October 2005. Greengen Company Ltd (Greengen) was \nlaunched  in  December  2005  with  a  mandate  to  lead  the  research,  development,  and \ndemonstration  (RD&D)  of  IGCC  and  CCS  technologies,  leading  to  a  near-zero  emission  coal-\nfired  power  plant  by  2015  under  the  GreenGen  program.  China  Huaneng  Group  (CHNG),  the \nlargest electricity-generating company in the PRC, is the managing company of Greengen, with \n51% of shares.21 Greengen has drawn up a three-phase RD&D program. The first phase (2008\u2013\n2011)  aims  to  implement  the  250  MW  Tianjin  IGCC  plant  (the  Project).22 The  second  phase \n(2011\u20132013) is expected to implement a scaled-up IGCC plant of 400 MW and more with pilot \ntesting of CCS. The third phase (2015 onwards) will implement fully integrated IGCC and CCS \nwith  a  near-zero  emission  coal-fired  power  plant.  The  Project  is  supported  by  the  Ministry  of \nScience  and  Technology  (MOST)  and  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \n(NDRC). It is listed as one of the major projects for scientific development in the 11th FYP under \nthe  National  High-Tech  RD&D  Program.  Tianjin  is  selected  as  the  location  in  consideration  of \nfuture CCS application and its proximity (45 kilometers) to the Dagang oil field, which is owned \nby  China  National  Petroleum  Corporation. 23  Appendix  2  includes  more  information  on  the \nGreenGen program.  \n \n13. \nCHNG is a wholly state-owned enterprise (SOE) that has been at the forefront of clean \ncoal  technologies  and  led  supercritical  and  USC  development  and  deployment  in  the  PRC.  It \ndoubled  its  installed  capacity  of  43  GW  in  2005  to  86  GW  in  2008  and  contributes  10%  to \nnational  electricity  production,  generating  364.5  TWh  in  2008.  CHNG  has,  as  the  managing \ncompany  of  Greengen,  identified  the  project  location  as  its  IGCC  base.  It  is  expected  to \nconsider installing more than 1 GW of IGCC capacity by 2015. CHNG also implemented a 3,000 \nt/year pilot project of CO2 capture and industrial utilization in 2008 at its Gao Bei Dian plant, a \n\n                                                 \n18 The studies were conducted by the National Energy Technology Laboratory in the United States in 2007 and IEA in \n\n2008.  \n\n19 CCS  is  particularly  suited  to  capturing  CO2  from  large  point  sources  (those  with  more  than  100,000  t  of  CO2 \n\nemissions/year). A 300 MW coal-fired power plant typically emits more than 1 million t of CO2 every year.  \n\n20 The carbon intensity is the amount of CO2 emitted per $1,000 of GDP. \n21 The other shareholders are four other main generators (China Datang Group, China Huadian Corporation, China \nGuodian Corporation, and China Power Investment Company), two large coal-mining companies (Shenhua Group \nand China Coal Group), and the State Development and Investment Company. \n\n22 The Government is considering implementing three other IGCC plants\u2014250 MW at Zhejiang and 400 MW each at \nLangfang and Yantai\u2014to demonstrate a critical mass of IGCC projects with different gasifier technologies and plant \nsize.  \n\n23 It is expected that the first CCS application will be for enhanced oil recovery possibly from Dagang oil field.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nsupercritical coal-fired plant near Beijing. It is currently implementing a scaled-up 100,000 t/year \nCO2  capture  and  industrial  utilization  project near  Shanghai at  another  supercritical plant.  The \nimplementation  of  these  CO2  capture  projects  at  coal-fired  power  plants  signifies  CHNG's \nstrategic intent to lead CCS technology development in the PRC. While CCS is not included in \nthe  Project,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  helping  the  Government  and  Greengen  to \nidentify the key issues and barriers and prepare a road map for CCS demonstration through a \ncomplementary technical assistance (TA) grant.24 \n \n14. \nThe  successful  completion  of  the  Project  will  demonstrate  the  viability  of  IGCC \ntechnology  and  identify  a  clear  pathway  for  multiple  demonstration  projects  and  its  future  full-\nscale  deployment.  The  timely  and  successful  completion  of  phase  one  of  the  GreenGen \nprogram is critical to triggering the ensuing phases of near-zero emission coal-fired power plant \ndevelopment  by  2015,  which  has  the  potential  to  greatly  cut  GHG  emissions  from  coal-fired \npower plants and play a crucial role in lowering the carbon intensity of the electricity generation.   \n \n\n3. \n\nStrategies of the Government  \n\njointly  owned  provincial  power-generation  companies,  along  with \n\n \n15. \nThe  Government  has  implemented  significant  reforms  in  the  energy  sector.  National \nenergy enterprises have autonomy for investment decisions, and coal prices are gradually being \nderegulated. The power subsector was unbundled in 2003 with the creation of five national and \ntwo  power-\nseveral \ntransmission  and  distribution  companies  that  have  provincial  subsidiaries  for  satisfying \nconsumer demand. However, transmission and distribution functions are still bundled together. \nUnbundling  these  functions  is  being  carefully  considered.  The  independent  State  Electricity \nRegulatory Commission is now present in all provinces. Recognizing the importance of energy \nto the national economy, the National Energy Administration was set up within NDRC in 2008 \nand is now functional. NDRC regulates the retail electricity tariff. The adoption and approval of \nnew  technology  and  demonstration  plants  are  carefully  considered  before  approval  of \ninvestment  decisions.  The  approach  is  to  encourage  competition  and  send  a  strong  signal \nregarding efficiency even at the demonstration stage. This approach, combined with the largest \nmarket  for  new  and  innovative  technologies,  proved  successful  in  bringing  down  costs,  thus \nfacilitating quick deployment, as demonstrated in the large addition of new wind power projects \nin  the  past  3  years.  Tariff-setting  principles  are  based  on  cost  recovery  with  adequate  returns \nand have been consistently applied for more than a decade. Higher tariffs for new technology \nprojects have been consistently approved. Appendix 3 provides more details on the sector.  \n \nThe Government recognizes the environmental challenges and climate change impacts \n16. \nof its growing energy use and prioritized energy efficiency and environmental protection in the \n11th FYP. The plan includes obligatory targets to improve energy intensity by 20% and reduce \nby  10%  major  pollutants,  including  SO2,  which  is  emitted  mostly  by  coal-fired  power  plants. \nSince  the  announcement  of  the  targets,  the  State  Council  has  issued  a  number  of  guidelines \nand  plans  to  intensify  efforts  to  improve  energy  efficiency  and  reduce  pollution.  The  recently \namended Energy Conservation Law became effective on 1 April 2008. Power generation plays \na  significant  role  in  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  has  shown  consistent  progress  in \nimproving  the  efficiency  of  coal-fired  power  plants  and  lowering  emissions.  The  Government \nannounced  in  2008  its  Climate  Change  Action  Plan,  which  recognizes  the  importance  of \nscientific research and supports developing advanced technologies such as IGCC and CCS.

ADB supports the Government\u2019s sector strategies to move towards a low-\ncarbon path through (i) energy efficiency and conservation, (ii) renewable energy development, \n(iii) urban environment improvement through more efficient energy production and distribution, \n(iv) clean coal technology development, (v) coal mine and coal bed methane development, and \n(vi)  regional  cooperation  to  strengthen  energy  security.  Clean  coal  development  has  been  a \npriority  area  for  ADB  operations  in  the  PRC.  ADB  provided  grant-financed  TA25 in  1997  to \nassess  the  appropriateness  of  IGCC  technologies  and  prepare  the  conceptual  design  of  an \nIGCC  demonstration  plan.26 The  TA  was  implemented  in  close  cooperation  with  the  Thermal \nPower  Research  Institute  (TPRI)  in  Xian,  the  leading  research  organization  in  thermal  power \nengineering in the PRC.27 Since late 2007, ADB has worked closely with CHNG and Greengen \nand  provided  a  small-scale  TA  in  2008  to  support  project  development.28 Recognizing  the  key \nrole of IGCC and CCS technologies in climate change mitigation, ADB has formed partnerships \nwith  leading  knowledge  bodies\u2014the  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership  Forum  and  the  Global \nCCS  Institute  in  Australia\u2014in  this  emerging  area  directly  relevant  to  its  developing  member \ncountries. These partnerships have provided access to expert networks and created dedicated \nresources to help accelerate CCS demonstration.29  \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s Clean Energy and Environment Program includes innovative instruments such as \nthe multidonor-funded, $150 million Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, Future Carbon Fund, and CCF. \nAll  these  funds  are  directly  relevant  to  the  Project\u2019s  need  for  low-cost,  long-term  financing \naiming to demonstrate an innovative technology. By successfully demonstrating the advantages \nof  IGCC  technology  the  Project  will  reinforce  confidence  in  the  viability  of  this  technology  and \nencourage policy makers to approve more IGCC projects. Multiple demonstration projects with \ninternational support will shorten the learning curve and help achieve economies of scale. ADB \nproject support will provide additional technical due diligence and help mitigate risks, strengthen \ncompliance with  safeguards,  and  thereby  establish  appropriate  benchmarks  and standards  for \nfuture IGCC projects.    \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\n \nADB's experience in the PRC energy sector is that projects are generally well planned \n19. \nand  smoothly  implemented.  The  implementation  performance  of  ADB's  energy  portfolio  is \nsatisfactory. The country assistance program evaluation in 2007 recorded that the performance \nof  more  than  83%  of  energy  projects  was  either  satisfactory  or  highly  satisfactory.  It  warned \nabout  possible  start-up  delays  as  sector  operations  move  towards  more  innovative  and \nchallenging areas of energy efficiency, renewables, and advanced technology. Like projects in \nother  sectors,  some  energy  projects  experienced  such  delays,  mainly  because  of  (i)  multiple \n                                                 \n25 ADB.  1997.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Study  on  Clean  Coal  Integrated \n\nGasification Combined Cycle Technology. Manila. (TA 2792-PRC, approved on 19 May, for $500,000). \n\n26 The  TA  produced  a  conceptual  design  for  the  Yantai  IGCC  plant  in  Shandong  Province  that  is  proposed  for \n\nimplementation by another agency.  \n\n27 TPRI is jointly owned by the five main power generating companies, but CHNG has majority shareholding of 51%.  \n28 ADB.  2008.

Manila (TA 7146-PRC, approved on 8 October, \nfor $200,000). \n\n29 The  CCS  Fund  was  created  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  using  a  contribution  from \n\nAustralia of A$21.5 million in 2009.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nproject  components  that  require  elaborate  onlending  formalities  and approvals  in  the  PRC;  (ii) \ndelayed feasibility report approval, which signifies the formal investment decision; and (iii) weak \ncapacity in the executing agency (EA) and implementing agency (IA), especially those not fully \nfamiliar  with  ADB  policies,  procedures,  and  requirements.  To  minimize  or  eliminate  start-up \ndelays, relevant lessons identified in previous projects were fully incorporated into the design of \nthe Project. All relevant national approvals are in place, including the feasibility report. In terms \nof  capacity,  the  project  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  among  the  strongest  in  the \ncountry and internationally. Some key risk areas were further addressed through small-scale TA \n(para.  17,  footnote  28).  Appendix  4  provides  more  information  on  ADB  experiences  and \nlessons. \n \n20. \nAs this is the first IGCC project in the PRC, particular attention has been paid to some \nspecific technical and management challenges. To fully incorporate lessons from similar plants \nin  Europe,  proper  technical  due  diligence  was  carried  out  by  international  experts  and  their \nsuggestions  were  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  It  has  also  been  ensured  that  future \nsupport will be available from international experts during the construction and initial operation \nphase.  A  formal  cooperation  agreement  was  signed  between  Huaneng  Tianjin  IGCC  Co.,  Ltd. \n(HTICL) and the owner of the Puertollano IGCC Plant in Spain.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe impact of the Project will be reduced GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants. \nThe  outcome  will  be  the  IGCC  plants  demonstrating  climate  change  mitigation  effect  of  new \ntechnology deployed. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe  project outputs  include  (i)  constructing  and  operating  an  IGCC  power  plant  of  250 \nMW capacity in Binhai New Area, Tianjin city for generating 1,470 gigawatt-hours of electricity \nannually, which will be sold to the Northern China Grid Company Limited through a 220 kilovolt \ninterconnecting  transmission  line;  (ii)  adequate  capacity  in  project  management,  safeguard \ncompliance,  and  plant  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  and  (iii)  capacity  developed  for \nobtaining carbon offset revenues from IGCC plants. \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nDemonstration of an Innovative and Advanced Clean Coal Technology  \n\n \nThe  Project  will  introduce  IGCC  technology,  the  most  efficient  and  least  polluting \n23. \nadvanced clean coal technology currently available commercially (para. 10, footnotes 15) for the \nfirst time in PRC. Technologically, the Project represents a significant change from conventional \ncoal-fired  power  plants  as  it  involves  the  gasification  of  the  coal  before  combustion.  As  a \ncollaborative project of all major energy enterprises in the PRC (para. 12 and footnote 21), the \nProject offers a natural knowledge platform and will disseminate experiences and results to all \nmajor energy enterprises in the PRC. The Project is a cornerstone of the critical first of the three \nphases  in  the  GreenGen  program  (para.  12)  that  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  near-zero  emission \ncoal-fired  power  plant  by  2015.  Project  implementation  will  provide  valuable  insights  into  the \nchallenges,  issues,  and  benefits  of  IGCC  technologies  that  will  guide  the  ensuing  phases.  By \nsuccessfully  applying  IGCC  technology  in  an  industrial-size  coal-fired  power  plant,  the  Project \nwill  bolster  the  confidence  of  investors,  project  developers,  and  policy  makers  in  IGCC \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ntechnology  and  pave  the  way  for  multiple  demonstration  projects.  As  more  IGCC  plants  are \nimplemented  and  designers  get  more  confident  in  dealing  with  the  technology,  larger  IGCC \nplants in the range of 400 MW and higher will be implemented, which will reduce costs per MW \nand  narrow  the  current  incremental  cost  gap  of  80%  compared  with  USC  plants  to  20%.  The \nPRC  is  potentially  the  largest  market  for  IGCC,  whose  wider  deployment  will  encourage  cost-\ncompetitive local manufacturing of key components, which will further reduce the cost and bring \nrapid deployment.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInnovative Risk Mitigation Measures \n\n \n24. \nProject implementation carries risks inherent in any project demonstrating an advanced \nand  innovative  technology  for  the  first  time  in  a  country.  A  unique  approach  was  adopted  to \nsubstantially  reduce  risk  without  increasing  project  cost,  which  is  already  a  major  barrier  to \npromoting IGCC technology. Lessons on improving the sustainability and performance of similar \nIGCC power plants in Europe and elsewhere were incorporated into project design by utilizing \npart  of  the  $5  million  grant  from  ADB's  CCF.30 The  initial  O&M  period  of  about  2  years  for  an \nIGCC  demonstration  plant  is  critical  to  ensuring  its  sustainability,  especially  for  its  key \ncomponents\u2014the coal gasifier and gas turbines. The suppliers' direct supervision and support \nduring  this  critical  phase,  financed  through  the  grant,  will  (i)  provide  enhanced  technical \nexpertise at a short notice; (ii) help quickly diagnose problems; and (iii) strengthen the quality of \nO&M,  which  will  help  the  Project  quickly  stabilize  at  its  designed  performance  level.  Supplier-\nassisted O&M will provide on-the-job training to HTICL staff, thereby developing their capacity \nand  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  the  Project.  The  grant  will  also  be  used  to  engage \ninternational and national consultants for a total of 16 person-months to support the compliance \nwith  the  safeguards,  and  in  project  management,  monitoring  and  reporting.  This  will  establish \nappropriate  benchmarks  and  standards  for  future  IGCC  projects.  Additionally,  to  avoid  any \nfinancial distress to HTICL during the initial operation period, a grace period of 6 years for the \nADB loan is included.  \n \n\nPotential Benefits from Clean Development Mechanism \n\n3. \n \nThe  Project  is  anticipated  to  be  eligible  for  certified  emission  reductions  (CERs)  under \n25. \nthe  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM). 31  By  applying  the  approved  Consolidated \nMethodology, 32  emission  reductions  will  be  achieved  through  higher  efficiency,  thereby \nreplacing coal usage in pulverized coal-fired power generation. Based on this methodology, four \nhigh-efficiency pulverized coal-fired power plants in the PRC have been designed and are being \nprepared for the CDM validation stage. The Project will construct the first IGCC power plant in \nthe PRC that would be eligible under the modalities and procedures of CDM. ADB's Technical \nSupport  Facility  under  its  Carbon  Market  Initiative  (CMI)  is  helping  Greengen  to  develop  the \nCDM  project  design  document  based  on  the  approved  methodology  to  support  its  registration \nwith  the  CDM  Executive  Board.  As  IGCC  technology  is  considered  to  have  high  potential  for \nreducing GHGs, the Technical Support Facility\u2019s additional support for devices and processes to \nmonitor  and  validate  GHG  reduction  is  being  considered  to  provide  enhanced  support  for  this \n                                                 \n30 A  similar  grant  of  $800,000  from  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  was  approved  in  2008  for  an \ninnovative multitranche financing facility for Guangdong: ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  and  Administration  of  Grant  for  the  People's \nRepublic  of  China  for  Guangdong  Energy  Efficiency  and  Environment  Improvement  Investment  Program.

CDM validation is a process in CDM \nproject development cycle after the project design, successful validation will lead to the registration of the project. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ndemonstration project. The initial assessment has the Project avoiding 134,000 t of coal usage \nper  year  and  generating  372,000  CERs  annually.  In  addition  to  this,  the  project  would  also \ncontribute greatly in reducing emissions of both greenhouse gases and local pollutants like SOx \nand  NOx.  HTICL  has  shown  interest  in  considering  the  CMI\u2019s  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund  or \nFuture Carbon Fund to contract CERs, which may frontload up to 50% of the aggregated CERs \nup  to  2020.  The  quantification  of  CDM  benefits  at  the  current  market  price  tends  to  grossly \nunderstate the global benefits from GHG emission reduction.33  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  cost  of  the  Project  is  $419.59  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \n\n26. \ncontingencies and financial charges during development (Table 1).  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

The  estimates  are  conservative,  with \nsufficient  contingencies  to  cater  for  the  demonstration  nature  of  the  Project.  A  detailed  cost \nestimate is in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n33 Total 2008 meta-analysis for marginal social damage of carbon based on the Integrated Assessment Model cited \n\nby the IPCC estimates $75 per t of CO2, or many times the $10\u2013$15 per t in the current market.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nE. \n \n28. \nThe Government has requested financing of up to an equivalent of $135.0 million (32% \nof project cost) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the purchase of goods, works, \nand consulting services, including taxes and duties estimated to be $19.5 million on the ADB-\nfinanced  portion  of  project  costs.  The  remaining  cost  will  be  financed  through  equity \ncontributions of $84.0 million equivalent (20% of project cost) and a domestic loan of $195.59 \nmillion  equivalent  (47%  of  project  cost)  from  a  group  of  local  banks  led  by  the  China \nConstruction Bank. ADB's Climate Change Fund will provide a grant cofinancing equivalent to \n$5.0  million  (1%  of  project  cost)  to  finance  some  components  of  the  Project  (para.  24).

The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these \nterms and conditions, and an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nOnlending Arrangements  \n\n1. \n \n30. \nThe Borrower of the ADB loan will be the PRC, and loan proceeds will be relent by the \nBorrower through the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to the Export and Import Bank of China (EXIM \nBank) on the same terms and conditions as the loan between ADB and the PRC. EXIM Bank \nwill, in turn, onlend these loan proceeds to CHNG on similar loan terms as the EXIM Bank loan \nand  include  an  administration  fee  of  0.15%  for  providing  onlending  services  to  MOF.  CHNG, \nthrough an onlending agreement, will then onlend the loan proceeds to Greengen, who will then \nthrough a separate onlending agreement lend the proceeds to HTICL as the IA under a fourth \nonlending  agreement,  which  again  will  incorporate  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  their \nagreement with EXIM Bank. HTICL shall bear the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuation. \nThough  HTICL  is  a  separate  legal entity,  it  will  continue  to  have  close  management  links  with \nGreengen, which will provide management oversight to HTICL. Information about EXIM Bank is \nin Appendix 6.   \n \n31. \nThe  role  of  EXIM  Bank  in  the  Project  is  crucial  to  facilitate  onlending  from  MOF  to \nCHNG, an SOE. EXIM Bank is a policy bank of the Government under the direct administration \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nof  the  State  Council.  It  has  the  same  credit  rating  as  the  Government  of  the  PRC.  Onlending \nloans and grants to SOEs from international financial institutions is one of its main roles. It has \nplayed a similar role in World Bank and European Investment Bank loans but not yet for ADB \nloans.34 This  onlending  modality  through  EXIM  Bank  will  test  an  innovative  new  approach  for \nfuture  ADB  lending  support  to  similar  advanced  technology  projects  in  areas  of  clean  energy \nand  climate  change  mitigation  that  will  be  implemented  by  SOEs.  The  fund  flow  of  loan \nproceeds is consistent with the project organization chart included in Appendix 7.    \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n32. \nCHNG will be the EA. It is the managing partner of Greengen, which was established in \n2005 with an authorized share capital of CNY300 million. Greengen established HTICL with the \nmandate  to  develop  the  Project  and  to  be  the  IA.  HTICL  was  registered  as  a  limited  liability \ncompany under PRC law in November 2008. Greengen will provide management support and \noversight  to  HTICL,  supporting  Project  implementation,  particularly  in  relation  to  financial \nmanagement, financial control, and accounting, and ensuring good governance of the Project. \nGreengen is also responsible for liaising with CHNG. Establishing HTICL as a separate project \nentity  is  considered  prudent  as  it  (i)  brings  transparency,  (ii)  improves  accountability  and \ncorporate  governance,  and  (iii)  ensures  a  task  force  approach  to  project  development  that \nensures  a  strong  management  focus.  A  project  director  reporting  directly  to  the  president  of \nGreengen  will  be  responsible  for  project  management,  contract  approval,  and  payments.  A \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  established  in  HTICL  will  regularly  monitor  and  review \nimplementation  progress.  HTICL  has  already  established  an  environmental  management  unit \n(EMU)  to  coordinate  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  with \ncontractors and the Tianjin environment protection bureau. The EMU will oversee environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  during  construction  and  operation,  including  the  environmental \nsupervision  of  contractors.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager  responsible  for \nphysical  implementation  day  to  day  and  the  preparation  of  progress  reports.  A  team  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  will  assist  the  PIU  to  comply  with  safeguards,  and  for \nproject monitoring, review, and reporting. An organization chart for implementing the Project is \nin Appendix 7.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n33. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years  from  2009  to  2012.  The  Project's \npreconstruction activities, such as detailed design, preparing bidding documents, tendering, and \nawarding contracts, began in mid-2008. On-site preconstruction started in July 2009. Main civil \nworks will start in February 2010 and take about 20 months. The construction of the Project and \nthe expected completion date for the loan is June 2012, however the grant will be implemented \nover a longer period until June 2015 as it involves service contracts during implementation. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \n34. \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  and  goods \nunder  the  Project  will  be  properly  packaged  in  accordance  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines. \nCivil  works  contracts  costing  more  than  $10  million  and  goods  supply  contracts  costing  more \nthan  $1  million  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding \n\n                                                 \n34 The World Bank loan is for an energy efficiency project, for which EXIM Bank onlends the loan proceeds to energy \n\nefficiency enterprises in the PRC.    \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nprocedures  using  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  less  than \n$10  million  but  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \n(NCB). Goods supply contract packages costing more than $500,000 up to $1,000,000 will be \nprocured using either NCB or, in exceptional circumstances and with the prior approval of ADB, \nlimited  international  bidding  procedures.  Goods  supply  contract  packages  costing  less  than \n$500,000  will  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  A  general  procurement  notice  was \nposted  on  ADB's  website  on  26  March  2008.  An  initial  procurement  plan  was  prepared  and \napproved in August 2008 during project concept clearance. The procurement plan was updated \nand revised in view of refined cost estimates and timing. The revised procurement plan agreed \nwith  the  government,  Greengen,  and  HTICL  is  in  Appendix  9. 35 The  procurement  capacity \nassessment report and recommendations for the Project are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n35. \nThe loan will not finance consulting services. International and national consultants to be \nfinanced from the grant component (para. 24) of the Project will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Since the \nrequired  services  are  in  a  very  specialized  area  with  little  consulting  input,  three  individual \nconsultants  will  be  recruited.  Consulting  services  for  the  Project  are  estimated  at  4  person-\nmonths of international and 12 person-months of national. Consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  and  discussed \n36. \nwith  the  Government,  CHNG,  Greengen,  and  HTICL.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations,  grant  regulations,  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  HTICL  and  all \ncontractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project. \nAdditional  governance  and  anticorruption  provisions  in  relation  to  the  disclosure  of  non-\ncommercial  project  information  and  procurement,  project  performance  review,  and  dispute \nreview are included as specific assurances, which will be negotiated and included in the legal \ndocuments. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n37. \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other  details  as  agreed \nupon  in  the  grant  and  project  agreements.  To  facilitate  project  implementation  and  fund  flow, \ntwo imprest accounts for loan and grant funds, respectively, will be set up in a bank acceptable \nto ADB. The imprest accounts shall be managed by HTICL under the supervision of Greengen \nand used exclusively to finance ADB's share of eligible expenditures for the loan and grant as \nspecified  in the  loan  and  grant  agreements.36 The  initial  advances  to  be  deposited  to  the  loan \nand  grant  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be \n\n                                                 \n35 A  $5  million  grant  from  CCF  (para.  24)  will  be  utilized  for  financing  some  of  the  procurement  packages.  A  grant \n\nutilization plan is in Appendix 10. \n\n36 Bank charges on the imprest accounts may be financed from loan and grant resources.  \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nfinanced from the imprest account or 10% of the loan or grant amount, whichever is lower. To \nsimplify documentation, the statement of expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursement \nof eligible expenses and replenishment and liquidation of eligible expenditures financed from the \nimprest  accounts  for  any  individual  payment  not  exceeding  $200,000.  Payments  in  excess  of \nthe ceiling for statement of expenditure will be substantiated by full supporting documentation. \nDirect payment procedures will apply for large contracts under the Project. The reimbursement \nprocedure will be used for loan expenditures incurred under retroactive financing, where CHNG, \nGreengen, or HTICL will initially fund the eligible expenditures from its own resources.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAdvanced Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n\n \n38. \nInitial  procurement,  mainly  under  the  counterpart  funding  component,  started  in  mid-\n2008 (para. 33) with the preparation of bid documents, tendering, and bid evaluation. In view of \nthe advanced stage of project preparation, the Government requested ADB approval of advance \ncontracting for civil works and goods. ADB management approved this in August 2008.  \n \nThe Government has requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount for \n39. \nthe Project for expenditures are incurred in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding  loan  agreement  and  loan  effectiveness.  Retroactive  financing  is  sought  for \neligible  expenditures,  including  civil  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services  that  are  critically \nrequired at the start and in the initial stages of construction. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of advanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n40. \nThe  accounting,  internal  control,  and  reporting  systems  and  procedures  of  HTICL  will \nfollow  the  accounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC, \nwhich  requires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  generally  follow  international \naccounting  standards.  HTICL  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  its  operations  and  submit  to \nADB audited project accounts and agency financial statements, including a management letter, \nin  English  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  The  audit  report  will \ninclude a statement verifying whether the funds disbursed by ADB were used for the purposes \nfor which they were provided, as well as the separate auditor's opinion on the use of the imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure procedures. The submitted project accounts and agency \nfinancial statements should be of acceptable quality and subject to an independent audit by the \nprovincial or municipal audit bureau or an external auditor acceptable to ADB. The Government, \nCHNG, Greengen, and HTICL have been informed of ADB\u2019s policy on the submission of audited \nfinancial statements and possible penalties for delays in submission.  \n \n41. \nGreengen and HTICL will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of \nloan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  imprest  accounts,  and  the  performance  of  the \nconsultants.  The  reports  will  include  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation, \nincluding  brief  monthly  updates;  and  (ii)  a  completion  report  for  the  Project  not  later  than  3 \nmonths after project completion. In addition, Greengen and HTICL will provide ADB with reports \non  contract  management  procedures,  including  approval  of  variation  orders  and  progress \npayment certificates. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n42. \nA project performance and monitoring system, including indicators and their relevance, \nwas discussed with Greengen and HTICL during project preparation. The indicators are based \non  the  performance  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  Macroeconomic  and \nsector performance, institutional capacity, and ongoing reforms were taken into account in the \ndesign  of  monitoring  indicators,  which  include  environmental  and  socioeconomic  indicators. \nDuring  implementation,  implementation-supervision  consultants  and  EMU  will  help  HTICL \nmonitor  project  impact  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  implementation  progress  with  the  EMP \nthrough biannual progress reports. An environmental compliance report submitted in July 2009 \nindicated that project implementation was progressing well and in compliance with the EMP.   \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n43. \nADB will field regular missions at least once a year to assess project implementation and \ncompliance with the provisions of the loan, grant, and project agreements. An inception mission \nwill be fielded within 3 months of project approval. In 2011, ADB, CHNG, Greengen, and HTICL \nwill  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative, \norganizational,  technical,  environmental,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that \nmay  affect  the  performance  of  the  Project  and  its  continuing  viability.  The  midterm  review  will \nexamine progress on relevant sector reforms  and evaluate compliance with assurances in the \nlegal  agreements.  HTICL  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  promptly  after  the  physical \ncompletion of the Project but not later than 6 months thereafter. \n \n\nIV. \n\nGRANT FROM THE CLIMATE CHANGE FUND  \n\n \n44. \nBecause the Project demonstrates key energy efficiency technology with strong potential \nfor climate change mitigation, grant assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5 million from \nthe CCF is proposed. The grant will be utilized for (i) long-term maintenance contracts with the \nsuppliers  of  the  coal  gasifier  and  gas  turbines,  (ii)  the  civil  works  contract  cost  for  the  air \nseparation unit of the chemical island, and (iii) recruiting international and national consultants \nto  supervise  project  implementation.  The  grant  assistance  will  significantly  reduce  risks  (para. \n24)  and  strengthen  project  management  capacity  and  reporting  on  compliance  with  key \nsafeguards.  The  grant  passes  through  the  Borrower  to  HTICL  through  CHNG  and  Greengen. \nThe grant utilization plan is in Appendix 10.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project's  financial  viability  is  based  on  an  electricity  tariff  of  CNY0.56/kWh,  as \n45. \nproposed in the feasibility report, which is substantially higher than the prevalent CNY0.38/kWh \nelectricity  tariff  from  conventional  coal-fired  power  plants  in  Tianjin.  This  higher  tariff  reflects \nhigher capital and O&M costs for the first IGCC power plant in the PRC. While the actual tariff \nwill be formally set only after construction is completed, it is anticipated to be about the same as \nthe feasibility report tariff.  \n \n46. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present value (FNPV) were \ncalculated for the Project. Potential carbon offset revenues were not included in the base case \ncalculation.  The  FIRR  is  6.4%,  which  is  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC),  estimated  at  3.7%.  The  FNPV  is  CNY820.9  million  at  this  WACC.  The  Project  is \nconsidered  financially  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under  various \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nFinancial Performance of Greengen and CHNG  \n\nadverse conditions. The sensitivity analysis showed that the FIRR of the Project would decrease \nto  (i)  6.0%  if  the  Project  experienced  a  cost  overrun  of  10%,  (ii)  4.4%  if  project  benefits  were \nreduced by 10%, (iii) 5.5% if project O&M expenses increase by 10%, and (iv) 5.7% if project \ncompletion  is  delayed  by  1  year.  Inclusion  of  estimated  carbon  offset  revenues  up  to  2020 \nwould,  at  a  conservative  estimate,  improve  the  FIRR  to  7.2%  and  the  FNPV  to  CNY1,045.3 \nmillion  and  would  further  strengthen  the  Project's  financial  viability  and  improve  its  cash  flow. \nThe financial analysis of the Project is in Appendix 11. \n \nB. \n \n47. \nAnalysis  of  financial  performance  was  done  only  for  CHNG.  Greengen  and  HTICL  are \nnew  companies  with  little  historical  data.  An  analysis  of  CHNG\u2019s  financial  statements  for  the \npast 4 years was done following ADB's Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.37 The \naudited  financial  statements  of  CHNG  show  that  the  company\u2019s  financial  condition  has  been \nfairly sound except in 2008, when the global financial crisis significantly affected its operations. \nThat was a difficult year for CHNG, mainly due to low demand and lower regulated tariffs, which \nsubsequently increased in early 2009. Unlike the consistently good financial performance in all \nprevious years, the company sustained a net loss of CNY6.78 billion (4.5% of sales) in 2008.38 \nIts  financial  performance  will  continue  to  be  closely  monitored  during  project  implementation. \nMore data and information on financial management assessment and financial performance and \nprojections of project enterprises are in Appendix 12.  \n \n48. \nThe review of CHNG and HTICL financial management capacity and practices indicates \nthat the current systems, policies and standards, and training programs on general accounting \nand finance meet good national and international standards. CHNG's capital structure is robust, \nwith shareholders' equity comprising over 40% of its capital structure. However, it is noted that \nthe  company  has  embarked  on  a  very  large  capacity  expansion,  which  doubled  its  installed \ncapacity in the 3 years after 2005. This expansion, combined with the large investment needed \nto meet environmental regulations and the requirements of energy efficiency and conservation \nin coal-fired power plants, eroded its capital structure and reduced the equity position to about \n33%  in  2005  and  28%  in  2008.  CHNG  is  expected  to  reassess  its  capital  structure  in \nconsultation with the Government and seek more equity injection.  \n \n49. \nin Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nC. \n \n50. \nThe  electricity  demand  forecast  for  Tianjin  considered  trends,  structural  changes, \nefficiency  improvements,  GDP  growth,  and  other  planned  economic  developments  affecting \ndemand. Electricity demand was conservatively estimated to grow at 8% in 2011\u20132015 and 6% \nin 2015\u20132025. The estimates suggest that there will be continued strong demand for electricity \nin Tianjin, and the Project will provide incremental electricity to meet part of it.  \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was calculated to assess its \n51. \neconomic  viability.  Capital  costs  and  O&M  costs  were  considered.  Appropriate  conversion \nfactors  were  used  to  convert  financial  values  into  economic  values.  Values  are  expressed  in \n2009 local currency. The quantified benefits of the Project considered in the economic analysis \nincluded incremental energy supply through willingness to pay. This yielded an EIRR of 16.49%. \n\nHistorical and projected financial statements, as well as the key financial indicators, are \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n                                                 \n37 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n38 All five major electricity generators in the PRC showed significant losses in 2008.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Impacts  \n\nThe  EIRR  is  conservatively  calculated,  as  it  takes  into  account  only  the  main  benefits  and \nincludes  all  project-related  costs.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  simulating  adverse  scenarios \nwere  carried  out,  and  the  EIRR  was  found  to  be  stable  and  robust.  Appendix  13 presents  the \neconomic analysis of the Project. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB's \n52. \nenvironmental  classification  criteria  under \nits  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  project \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  prepared  by  the  Tianjin  Environment  Protection \nResearch  Institute,  was  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  (now \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment  Protection)  in  July  2007  and  uploaded  to  the  ADB  website  on  14 \nApril  2008.  A  summary  of  environmental  impacts  and  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  is  in \nAppendix 14. The full EIA report is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n53. \nCoal-fired IGCC power plants substantially reduce emissions of major air pollutants like \nSO2,  NOx,  total  suspended  particulates,  and  CO2  when  compared  with  conventional  power \nplants. In comparison to a conventional coal-fired power plant of 300 MW capacity, the avoided \nannual  emissions  from  the  IGCC  plant  are  estimated  at  43  t  of  total  suspended  particulate, \n1,237 t of SO2, and 3,325 t of NOx. On completion, the Project will save 134,000 t of coal per \nyear of operation. It will prevent an estimated 372,000 t of CO2 emissions annually and result in, \nassociated  global  climate  benefits.  The  Project  will  use  35%  less  cooling  water  than  an \nalternative conventional plant and generate significantly less slag.  \n \nThe IGCC plant is proposed to be located in an industrial area on land reclaimed from \n54. \nthe  Bohai  Sea.  The  environmental  value  of  the  land  and  its  surroundings  is  poor.  The \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  Project,  mainly  limited  to  construction,  are  dust  emissions,  soil \nerosion,  accidental  spillage,  noise  impacts,  and  waste  generation.  The  summary  EIA  reported \nthat the adverse environmental impacts of the Project can be minimized to acceptable levels by \nimplementing  adequately  funded  environmental  management  activities.  Project  cost  estimates \ninclude CNY88.25 million for environmental protection. The project monitoring plan and counter \nsupervision  of  all  construction  by  CHNG  and  its  contracted  environmental  representative  is \nto  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures  and  government \ndesigned \nenvironmental  legislation,  policies,  and  guidelines.  The  first  annual  environmental  compliance \nreport  was  submitted  in  July  2009.  As  project  construction  was  in  a  preliminary  stage, \nenvironment  impacts  were  minimal  and  complied  with  the  agreed  EMP.  To  further  strengthen \ncompliance, ADB will closely monitor construction through regular missions.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  Project  has  acquired  20  hectares  of  newly  reclaimed  land  in  an  existing  industrial \n55. \npark  and  therefore  does  not  entail  any  resettlement.  Based  on  ADB's  safeguard  policies,  it  is \ncategory C in terms of involuntary resettlement and indigenous people impacts. The Project will \nprovide  indirect  social  benefits  through  improved  air  quality  in  the  project  area.  During  project \nconstruction,  the  peak  number  of  workers  may  reach  1,000.  The  influx  of  workers  during \nconstruction  may  increase  the  incidence  of  disease,  particularly  epidemic  diseases.  Mitigation \nmeasures  will \nfor  workers  and  hygienic  worker \naccommodation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy report is in Appendix 15.   \n \n \n \n \n\ninclude  providing  health  education \n\nSocial Impacts  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures   \n\nF. \n \n56. \nAll  the  major  components  of  the  IGCC  power  plant  have  been  pilot  tested  or \ncommercially  established  and  are  in  successful  operation  in  the  PRC.  However,  these \ncomponents  have  not  yet  been  combined  in  a  reliable,  industrial-size  IGCC  power  plant. \nTherefore,  the  risks  involved  in  this  project  being  a  first-of-a-kind  risk  demonstration  project, \nexists, especially during the first 2 years of operation. The risk has been substantially reduced \nwith the help of a $5 million grant from ADB's CCF.  \n \nThe  coal  gasifier  is  a  significant  departure  from  a  conventional  coal-fired  power  plant. \n57. \nCoal gasification is a mature technology, and about 15 similar coal gasifiers as proposed for the \nProject  (2,000  t/day)  are  extensively  used  in  various  chemical  industry  plants  in  the  PRC.  At \nleast two gasifiers of the same capacity are installed in the Tianjin Harbor Industrial Park next to \nthe  Project  site,  in  the  Tianjin  Alkali  Plant.  The  Project  will  use  a  domestically  developed  coal \ngasifier  with  a  capacity  of  36  t/day  using  coal  of  the  same  quality,  a  prototype  of  which  was \ndesigned and constructed by TPRI in 2006. This prototype gasifier was extensively tested and \nhas  been  successfully  in  operation  for  over  10,000  hours.  The  Council  of  Scientific  and \nIndustrial  Research  Organizations  in  Australia  further  tested  this  prototype  gasifier  using \nimported coal and found it satisfactory. The scaling-up of the prototype is an industry norm. To \nfurther improve the reliability of the syngas supply for the Project, a syngas connection with the \nTianjin  Alakali  Plant  is  included,  which  will  provide  backup  in  case  the  gasifier  breaks  down, \nthus ensuring the reliability of electricity supply from the Project. \n \n58. \nThe  potential  risks  related  to  the  type  or  quantity  of  coal  supplied  to  the  IGCC  power \nplant  is  minimal.  The  coal  for  the  Project  will  be  supplied  by  Shenhua  Group,  the  largest  coal \nproducer in the country and an equity partner in Greengen. The coal will be supplied from the \nShenhua's  Shenfu-Dongsheng  and  Yitai  No.  4  coalfields  in  Inner  Mongolia  and  Shanxi  and \ntransported  by  railway  to  the  coal-unloading  system  in  the  Tianjin  Alkali  Plant  adjacent  to  the \nProject. The railway connection and coal-unloading system is already constructed. No additional \nrailway  or  coal-unloading  facility  will  be  built  for  the  IGCC  power  plant.  HTICL  and  Shenhua \nsigned  a  long-term  coal  purchase  agreement  for  the  Project  in  October  2008.  CHNG  is  the \nlargest generator in the PRC and has long-term contractual relationships with coal suppliers for \nmany power plants across the PRC.  \n \n59. \nProject  implementation  risks  are  minimal.  The  Project  is  fully  supported  by  MOST  and \nNDRC and listed as one of the major projects for scientific development in the 11th FYP. The \nProject's  feasibility  report  was  rigorously  reviewed  by  NDRC  and  other  experts  and  finally \napproved  on  9  May  2009.  All  other  relevant  national  approvals  are  in  place.  Greengen  has \nacquired  the  project  site  and  its  possible  future  extension  for  a  scaled-up  IGCC  plant  and  an \nintegrated  IGCC\u2013CCS  plant.  The  key  procurement  of  the  gas  turbine  and  coal  gasifier  was \nfinalized  before  feasibility  approval  to  improve  the  Project's  cost  estimates  and  refine  the \nfeasibility  report. 39  Construction  work  was  formally  launched  on  6  July  2009.  Advanced \ncontracting following ADB guidelines is ongoing, with most procurement expected to be finalized \nby mid-2010. The Project readiness filter is in Appendix 16. \n \n60. \nThe capacity of CHNG and HTICL is sufficient for the construction and O&M of the first \nIGCC  power  plant  in  the  PRC.  CHNG  pioneers  clean  coal  technologies  in  the  PRC.  It  has \nsuccessfully led the development of supercritical and USC technologies in power plants, which \n                                                 \n39 Early  finalization  of  these  critical  components  was  essential  to  ascertain  the  interfaces  and  proceed  with \npreliminary design with refined cost estimates. The coal gasifier is a proprietary item, and international competitive \nbidding was conducted for the gas turbine package. As these procurements were finalized much earlier, they are \nnot eligible for ADB financing or included in the procurement plan.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nhave promptly achieved their rated performance capacities. The latest USC plants are on a par \nwith  or  better  than  similar  international  plants.  The  staff  of  CHNG  and  Greengen,  who  has \nextensive  previous  experience  in  operating  large,  modern  coal-fired  power  plants,  will  be \nengaged  to  operate  and  maintain  the  Project.  CHNG  and  Greengen  are  extensively  recruiting \nand  training  young  graduates  with  chemical  engineering  backgrounds  to  complement  its \nextensive  thermal  power  plant  expertise.  The  suppliers'  assistance  with  O&M  (para.  24)  will \nfurther strengthen the O&M capacity of the project staff, enhancing sustainability.    \n \n61. \nElectricity tariffs in the PRC are regulated and approved by NDRC for individual power \nplants only towards the end of their construction. In the case of the Project, the feasibility report \nflagged a higher tariff of CNY0.56/kWh than the CNY0.38/kWh approved for conventional coal-\nfired power plants by NDRC in the project area. The Project is financially viable at this tariff of \nCNY0.56/kWh. Since NDRC has rigorously reviewed the feasibility report and approved it, the \nassociated risk of any lower tariff than in the feasibility report is minimal.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, CHNG, Greengen, and HTICL \n\n62. \nhave agreed to the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nTariff. HTICL shall make a tariff petition to the Borrower's National Development \nand  Reform  Commission  for  a  reasonable  tariff  for  electricity  generated  by  the \nProject  facilities  to  ensure  that  it  shall  cover  operating  costs,  maintenance  and \ndepreciation, debt service, and a reasonable return on HTICL's net fixed assets. \nCHNG  shall  support  HTICL's  tariff  petition  to  the  National  Development  and \nReforms Commission. \n\nPolicy  Change.  Within  10  working  days  of  becoming  aware  of  any  changes  to \nany policies, procedures, regulations, or guidelines that may adversely affect the \nfinancial  viability  of  the  Project,  including  power  pricing  and  load  dispatch \npolicies, CHNG, Greengen and/or HTICL will advise ADB of such change.  \n\nFinancial  Performance.  From  the  start  of  commercial  operation  of  the  Project, \nCHNG  and  Greengen  will  ensure  that  HTICL  maintains  (a)  a  debt-service \ncoverage ratio of 1.2, (b) a debt\u2013equity ratio of 80:20, (c) a reasonable return on \nfixed  assets,  and  (d) its  accounts  receivables at  a  level  that  does  not exceed  2 \nmonths of sales revenues. Within 5 years of the start of commercial operations, \nHTICL will improve its debt service coverage ratio to 1.3 and its debt\u2013equity ratio \nto 75:25.   \n\nFinancial  Governance.  CHNG  and  Greengen  will  cause  HTICL  to,  and  HTICL \nwill ensure that: (a) proper accounts and records are maintained and audited in \ntime  to  adequately  identify  the  use  of  Loan  proceeds  in  accordance  with  this \nLoan Agreement and the Project Agreement, and (b) a separate audit opinion is \nprepared on the statement of expenditure procedures and the imprest account.  \n\n(v)  Within 3 months of effectiveness, CHNG and Greengen will cause HTICL to, and \nHTICL  will:  (a)  establish  internal  accounting  and  financial  control  systems  in \naccordance  with  national  accounting  standards  to  ensure  the  (i)  regular \nmonitoring of expenditures and all financial transactions, and (ii) the safe custody \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n19\n\nof  all  assets  financed  under  the  Project,  including  all  Project  facilities;  (b) \nestablish  an  independent  and  autonomous  internal  audit  department;  and    (c) \nadopt  computerized  financial  and  management  information  systems  to  ensure \nefficient,  effective  and  accountable  financial  and  information  management:  in \neach case in a form and manner acceptable to ADB. \n\nEnvironment. HTICL will ensure that construction, operation, maintenance, and \nmonitoring  of  the  project  facilities  is  in  strict  conformity  with  (a)  all  applicable \nnational  and  provincial  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002), and other national, provincial, and local laws and regulations and \nstandards  on  environmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and  occupational  safety; \nand  (b)  all  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  detailed  in  the \ndesign and construction contracts, the operational guidelines, and the approved \nEIAs,  summary  EIA,  and  EMP  for  the  Project.  HTICL  will  ensure  that  an \nadequate  number  of  fulltime  personnel  and  sufficient  resources  are  provided  to \nmonitor the implementation of the environmental monitoring program, under the \nguidance  of  the  Tanggu  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  (TEPB).  HTICL  will \nensure that TEPB will review any changes to the project design that may have a \npotential  for  causing  negative  environmental  impacts,  so  that  environmental \nmonitoring and mitigation measures are adjusted accordingly in consultation with \nADB.  HTICL  will  submit  regular  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  semi-annual \nenvironmental reports in a format acceptable to ADB, until the loan closing date.  \n\n \n(vii)  Gender.

Prior to the use \n1. \nof natural gas, coal gasification was used to produce gas for lighting and heating in the United \nStates  and  the  United  Kingdom  in  the  early  19th  century.  Coal  gasification  was  used  in  many \nindustrial  applications  because  of  its  abundance  and  low  price,  replacing  natural  gas.  In  the \n1970s,  an  energy  crisis  brought  resurgent  interest  in  synthesis  gas  (syngas)  as  an  energy \nalternative.  Decades  of  research  and  development  in  coal  gasification  have  created  a  mature \ntechnology  that  is  currently  being  scaled-up  for  clean  energy  and  chemical  feedstock \nproduction.  \n \n2. \nIn  coal  gasification,  steam,  and  oxygen  are  injected  under  high  temperature  and \npressure  into  a  coal  gasifier  to  produce  combustible  syngas\u2014a  mixture  of  carbon  monoxide, \nhydrogen and other gaseous compounds. After being cleaned of sulfide and impurities, syngas \ncan  be  burned  in  high-efficiency  gas  turbines  to  generate  electricity.  Coal  gasification  is  a \nflexible  technology  to  produce  hydrogen,  which  is  recognized  as  a  potent  environmentally \ncleaner future source of energy. By the end of 2007, global gasification capacity had grown to \n56,238 megawatts (MW) thermal of syngas output from 144 plants.1 In the People's Republic of \nChina (PRC), coal gasification has been used for many decades, and 44 operating plants now \nconvert coal and petroleum residues into a variety of chemicals, fertilizers, and gaseous fuels. \nCurrent data show that the world's syngas capacity is projected to grow by another 17,135 MW \nthermal from 2008 to 2010, which is an increase of over 30%. Six of the 10 planned plants will \nbe in the PRC, all processing coal to produce chemicals, fertilizers, and methanol.  \n \nB. \n \nIntegrated  gasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC)  is  a  technology  that  combines  coal \n3. \ngasification and combined cycle power generation. In a combined cycle power plant, syngas is \nburned  in  a  high-efficiency  gas  turbine  to  generate  the  first  source  of  electricity.  To  improve \nefficiency, heat is recovered from both the gasification process and the gas turbine exhaust to \nproduce steam. This steam is then used to drive a steam turbine to generate the second source \nof  electricity.  Thus,  IGCC  integrates  a  coal  gasification  unit  with  a  combined  cycle  unit  that \ncombines  a  gas  turbine  with  a  steam  turbine.  This  has  higher  thermal  efficiency  than \nconventional  pulverized  coal.  The  thermal  efficiency  of  IGCC  is  expected  to  reach  50%  or \nhigher, compared with 34%\u201340% in a conventional pulverized coal power plant; future concepts \nthat  incorporates  a  fuel  cell  could  achieve  efficiency  nearly  twice  today's  coal  combustion \ntechnologies.2  \n \nWith growing concern about rising CO2 emissions, especially from large coal-fired power \n4. \nplants,  coal  gasification  is  gaining  momentum  with  its  higher  efficiency,  emission  reductions, \nand mature technology. Many new plants have recently been announced.   \n\nIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycle\u2014An Advanced Clean Coal Technology   \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory,  US  Department  of  Energy.  2007.

The  foremost \n5. \nadvantage is that coal gasification provides the opportunity to remove impurities such as sulfur, \nmercury,  and  particulates  before  burning  the  fuel,  using  readily  available  technologies.  In \naddition,  the  ash  produced  is  like  glass,  which  can  be  recycled  as  concrete  aggregate,  unlike \nthe waste ash of pulverized coal power plants that must be put into landfills, occupying useful \nland  and  potentially  contaminating  groundwater.

A \n6. \nrecent estimate indicates that the capital cost for IGCC is as high as $2,500 per kilowatt, about \ntwice  the  capital  cost  of  pulverized  coal.1 Table  A2.2  lists  the  major  coal-fired  and/or  petcoke-\nbased  IGCC  plants  in  the  world.  Most  IGCC  power  plants  in  operation  are  of  approximately \n200\u2013300  MW  capacity.  The  Sarlux  IGCC  at  the  Saras  oil  refinery  in  Sardinia  is  the  largest \noperating  IGCC  to  date,  producing  550  MW  of  electric  power.  With  growing  concerns  about \nclimate  change  caused  by  CO2  emissions,  and  stricter  emissions  requirements  from  local \nenvironmental authorities especially in terms of mercury removal, IGCC plants are finding favor \nwith  project developers  in  Europe  and  the  United  States, where  multiple  IGCC  plants  of up  to \n800 MW capacity have been announced. IGCC also offers a unique advantage in burning lower-\ngrade  coal  and  coal  blended  with  biomass  in  the  gasifier,  which  suggests  even  wider \napplicability for the technology.  \n  \n\nTable A2.2: Coal- and/or Petcoke-Based IGCC Demonstration Power Plants \n\n \nFuel \nCoal/Biomass \nCoal/Petcoke \nCoal/Petcoke \nCoal/Petcoke \nPetcoke \n\n \nPower Output \n250 MW \n260 MW \n250 MW \n335 MW \n115 MW \n\nCommenced \nOperation \n1994 \n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1997 \n\n \nLocation \nNuon Buggenum, Netherlands \nWabash, USA \nPolk, USA \nPuertollano, Spain \nPernis, Rotterdam \n\n                                                 \n1   IEA.

More recently, the focus has turned to near-zero emission technologies intended to \ntake  the  carbon  out  of  coal  combustion.  Demonstration  projects  already  funded  include  oxy \ncombustion and post-combustion capture. Many other projects, small and large, are in progress \naround the world, including in the PRC and other developing countries.  \n  \n8. \nAll  of  the  currently  available  technologies  (i.e.,  pre-combustion,  oxy  combustion,  and \npost-combustion) for separating a concentrated CO2 stream from a large power-generation plant \nrequire both significant additional equipment and a significantly increased input of energy, when \ncompared  with  technologies  without  capture.  This  requires  the  development  of  economical \nmethods  of  carbon  sequestration.  A  key  driver  for  coal  gasification  is  the  innate  capability  of \ngasification  technology  to  separate  and  capture  CO2  most  effectively.  Coal  gasification  units \ncould  be  modified  to  separate  CO2  generated  from  the  syngas  before  combustion  and  thus \neffectively  address  the  problem  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Therefore,  IGCC  has \nbeen viewed as the most cost-effective platform for long-term capture.2  \n \n9. \nCarbon  dioxide  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  or  capture-ready  discussions  have  often \nbeen confined to IGCC  plants, with an implied or actual assumption that capture could not be \nretrofitted to other types of power plants, principally pulverized coal, or that no special provisions \nwere needed to make such combustion units capture-ready.3 This view is also implicit in United \nStates energy policy, 4 as evidenced by its funding of IGCC.,5 With restrictions on CO2 emissions \nin  the  future,  IGCC  represents  an  important  advancement  for  power  generation.  Public \ninformation identifies 50 projects for United States operation beyond 2010.6 \n \nD. \n \n10. \nSince  the  early  1990s,  the  PRC  has  been  actively  pursuing  clean  coal  technologies. \nThere is a growing base for new high-efficiency supercritical and ultra-supercritical (USC) coal-\nfired units in operation in the PRC. By the end of 2007, seven domestically manufactured 1,000 \nMW  class  and  two  600  MW  class  USC  units  had  been  commissioned,  in  addition  to  226 \nsupercritical units with 600 MW. These efficient units greatly changed the paradigm of thermal \n\nClean Coal Technologies and IGCC Development in the PRC \n\n                                                 \n2  Sekar,  R.

Since \nthen, the Government has continued its effort to build an IGCC demonstration plant.  \n \n11. \nThe  PRC  has  the  potential  to  be  the  single  biggest  market  for  IGCC  because  of  its \nconsistently large capacity addition over the past 3 years and anticipated strong growth. In view \nof  the  PRC's  strong  domestic  manufacturing  capacity  and  abundant  low-cost  and  high-quality \nhuman  resources,  the  capital  cost  of  IGCC  in  the  PRC  will  very  likely  be  cheaper  than  in  the \nUnited  States  and  Europe.  Previous  energy  sector  practices  in  the  PRC  demonstrate  that  the \ndevelopment  and  mass  production  of  new  technologies  are  cost-effective  in  the  global  joint \neffort  against  climate  change,  especially  in  the  areas  of  energy  efficiency  improvement  and \nemission reduction. \n \nE. \n \nTo  support  the  development  of  IGCC  and  CCS  technologies,  the  PRC  announced  in \n12. \n2005 its GreenGen program, which was launched in December 2005 with a mandate to lead the \nresearch, development, and demonstration of cleaner coal technologies leading to a near-zero \nemission  coal-fired  power  plant  by  2015.  Greengen  has  identified  a  phased  approach.  In  the \nfirst  phase,  it  plans  to  implement  a  250  MW  coal-fired  IGCC  plant  at  Tianjin.  The  Project  is \nsupported  by  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  and  the  National  Development  and \nReform Commission and is listed as one of the major projects for scientific development in the \n11th  Five-Year  Plan  under  the  National  High-tech  Research  and  Development  Program.

Tianjin Harbor Industrial \nPark is located in Tanggu district of Tianjin, 46 kilometers (km) from Tianjin city center, 38 km \nfrom Tianjin International Airport, and 2 km from Tianjin port. The industrial park is planned to \ncover  80  square  km.  The  first  phase  of  the  industrial  park  is  mainly  for  the  chemical  and \npetrochemical  industries,  while  the  second  phase  is  primarily  for  shipbuilding  and  ship-repair, \nequipment manufacture, metal processing, and some manufacturing. The third phase will also \ninclude major chemical industries.  \n \nThe  North-West  Electricity  Research  Institute  is  the  overall  designer  of  the  Project, \n15. \nsupported  by  Thermal  Power  Research  Institute,  Xian  and  Wuhan  Engineering  Company  Ltd.  \nThe key components of the Tianjin IGCC Power Plant include (i) a 2,000 tons/day coal gasifier; \n(ii)  a  172.8  MW  gas  turbine  generator;  (iii)  a  94.5  MW  steam  turbine  generator;  and  (iv)  200 \nkilovolt  (kV)  gas  insulated  switchgear.  On  completion,  the  Tianjin  IGCC  power  plant  will \ngenerate 1,470 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually, which will be evacuated through a 220 kV \ntransmission line to an existing substation for connection with the Tianjin power grid. The Tianjin \npower grid is connected to the North China Power Grid through 500 kV transmission lines.  \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nOverview of the People\u2019s Republic of China Power Sector \n\n \nA. \n \nThe People's Republic of China (PRC), with a population of 1.3 billion and an economy \n1. \ngrowing at an average annual rate of over 9.5% in the past 2 decades, has become one of the \nlargest energy producers and the second largest energy consumer in the world. By 2008, total \ninstalled power-generation capacity had reached 793 gigawatt, and annual electricity generation \nwas  3,433  billion  kilowatt-hours. 1  In  view  of  accelerated  urbanization  and  industrialization, \npower-generation capacity is expected to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.

Beijing. \n \n2. \nWhile the PRC has been taking steps to diversify energy resources, especially nuclear \npower and non-hydro renewables, it remains heavily dependent on coal as primary energy and \nfuel for power generation. Coal accounts for 70% of total primary energy consumption, which is \nfar above the world average of 26%.2 Non-hydro renewable energy has been expanding rapidly \nsince  2006  but  faces  the  challenges  of  higher  cost  than  coal-fired  power  plants  and  long \ntransmission lines. In 2008, thermal power generation accounted for 80.9% of power generation \nin the country. Hydropower constituted 16.4%, and nuclear, wind, and other energy resources \ncontributed the remaining 2.7%, including less than 0.5% from wind.   \n \nElectricity  consumption  is  dominated  by  energy-intensive  heavy  industries,  including \n3. \ncement, metallurgy, petrochemicals, chemicals, clay and porcelain, glass, papermaking, textiles,  \nand  other  manufacturing  industries.  Heavy  industry  alone  accounts  for  61%  of  total  electricity \nconsumption, while residential consumption is only 12%.  \n \n4. \nEnergy efficiency has been a high priority for PRC policy makers and has gained even \ngreater  prominence  over  the  past  few  years  as  the  main  approach  to  addressing  both  energy \nsecurity  and  environmental  concerns. 3  The  Government  of  the  PRC  has  identified  power \ngeneration  as  a  priority  sector  to  be  targeted  to  improve  energy  efficiency.  Compared  with \ninternational best practice, there is still large scope for improvement.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nSustained  and  impressive  growth  for  more  than  2  decades  is  testimony  to  the  sector's \nability  to  meet  the  need  for  additional  capacity.  The  Government  has  set  out  to  transform  the \n                                                 \n1   Electricity generation and related data in this appendix are from China Electricity Council. 2008.

World Energy Outlook 2007: China and India Insights. Paris. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nSector Reforms   \n\nsector from a centrally planned structure to a market-based system. In 2002, the former State \nPower  Company  was  dismantled.  Its  generating  assets  were  reallocated  to  five  generating \ncompanies:  China  Datang  Corporation,  China  Huadian  Corporation,  China  Guodian \nCorporation,  and  China  Power  Investment  Corporation  and  its  transmission  and  distribution \nassets were split between two grid companies: State Grid and China Southern Grid. \n \n6. \nThe National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is the sector's top planning \nand  regulatory  agency.  Recognizing  the  strategic  importance  of  energy  to  the  economy,  the \nState  Council  upgraded  the  Energy  Bureau  of  NDRC  to  become  the  National  Energy \nAdministration  in  2008.  Although  the  administration  is  still  under  the  supervision  of  NDRC,  it \nreports  directly  to  the  State  Council.  The  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  since \n2003 overseen regulating the electricity subsector.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nAs other energy subsectors, i.e., coal, oil, and gas, have been considerably deregulated \nand become more flexible in determining prices, electricity is still in transition. Current electricity \npricing  regulation  needs  to  be  understood  in  the  broader  context  of  its  single-buyer  model  for \npower transactions. In general, generators sell power to the grid companies at regulated prices, \nand the grid companies sell the power to end-users also at regulated prices. Although the State \nElectricity Regulatory Commission was established in 2003, NDRC still sets the electricity tariff \nbased on the costs of power generation, transmission, and distribution, including a reasonable \nrate of return on investments. NDRC has gradually reformed the electricity tariff structure in the \npast  few  years,  in  part  to  encourage  improvements  in  efficiency.  The  prices  paid  to  new \ngenerators are set according to the technologies in use in each province. For example, within a \nprovince, all new coal-fired plants with desulfurization are paid the same price, which is different \nfrom the price paid to other technologies such as hydropower. The efficiency of energy-intensive \nindustries  was  reviewed  and  categorized  by  energy  efficiency.  Price  discounts  have  been \nabolished  and  surcharges  increased  for  the  least  efficient.  This  pricing  policy  has  been  quite \neffective.  By  2006,  about  1,200  high  energy-consuming  enterprises  were  understood  to  have \nshut  down,  suspended  operations,  invested  in  energy  efficiency,  or  changed  production \nprocesses. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe PRC electricity industry needs constructive restructuring and more rapid movement \ntowards  market  mechanisms.  Some  key  initiatives  like  efficiency-based  load  dispatch  and \nelectricity markets are being piloted and are expected to be gradually introduced under the 12th \nFive-Year Plan 2011\u20132015. With growing concerns about global warming and climate change, \nthe  challenge  will  be  to  reduce  the  carbon  intensity  of  its  electricity  generation  significantly  by \n2020. Future electricity policies have to encourage technology innovations and the efficient use \nof  limited  resources  and  balance  them  with  long-term  social  welfare.  This  may  mean  a \ncombination of energy-efficient technologies being powered by a range of renewable and fossil \nfuels.  The  future  electricity  policy  framework  should  include  a  mechanism  through  which \nelectricity firms are pushed to pursue higher production efficiency.  \n\nFuture Reforms in the PRC \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND ITS LESSONS  \n \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nA. \n \nSince 1987, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved assistance for more than \n1. \n30  energy  projects  totaling  $3.6  billion  to  the  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China \n(PRC). The assistance has been divided evenly between projects that increased energy supply \n($1.8  billion)  and  those  that  improved  the  environment  ($1.8  billion).  About  47%  was  for \nhydropower, pumped-storage, and coal-mine methane projects; 20% for transmission lines; and \n33% for thermal power. Since 2000, more attention has been paid to environment and climate \nchange issues, and there has been a focus on projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, \nand  capture  of  coal-mine  and  coal-bed  methane.  These  projects  not  only  helped  the  PRC \nexpand its power supply capacity but also directly reduced coal consumption and consequently \nreduced emissions of pollutants, including greenhouse gases linked to global climate change. \n \n2. \nADB  has  also  provided  about  100  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for  the  energy \nsector, costing about $50 million, to help prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build the \ninstitutional  capability  of  utilities  (power,  district  heat,  and  urban  gas  supply)  that  are  the \nimplementing agencies of ADB loans. ADB provided TA projects to help restructure the power \nsubsector, formulate power-pricing strategy, improve the power-planning process, and establish \nthe  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission.  TA  also  covered  clean  production, 1  energy \nconservation,2 energy efficiency,3 and environmental management.4 ADB is currently conducting \na  comprehensive  study  jointly  with  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  to \nanalyze  the  opportunities  and  challenges  for  promoting  energy  efficiency  and  renewable \nenergy. 5  It  will  make  practical  policy  recommendations  to  overcome  barriers,  facilitate  the \nimplementation of development strategies and industrial policies, explore innovative approaches \nto utilizing external assistance, and identify key provinces and projects for piloting high-impact \nclean energy projects. \n \n3. \nADB  has  also  extended  two  project  loans  totaling  $90  million  to  the  private  sector  for \npower  generation.  Its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  is  now  providing  a  program  of \npartial credit risk guarantees with an overall limit of CNY800 million to cover an agreed portion \n(about 48% of the portfolio) of principal repayment of loans extended by selected partner banks \nto finance energy efficiency projects. This innovative mechanism can mobilize domestic banks \nto  provide  loans  for  energy  efficiency  projects  by  reducing  performance  uncertainties  and \nsharing credit risks.  \n \n4. \nOther major multilateral agencies active in the PRC also support the energy sector. The \nWorld  Bank  has  been  the  largest  multilateral  funder  for  PRC  power  sector.  Since  the  early \n1990s,  it  has  provided  more  than  $6.2  billion  to  finance  25  projects,  most  of  which  are  large \nthermal  and  hydropower  generation  projects  and  power  transmission  and  distribution  projects. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is \nproviding assistance for studies regarding options for power sector restructuring and promoting \nenergy  conservation.  The  ongoing  China  End-Use  Energy  Efficiency  Project  aims  to  promote \nenergy  efficiency  in  major  energy-consuming  sectors  such  as  industries  and  building \nconstruction.  \n \n5. \nAmong  bilateral  sources,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  is  the  largest \nsource  of  external  assistance  for  the  PRC\u2019s  power  subsector.  It  has  provided  concessional \nloans totaling CNY438 billion for 14 power projects through its official development assistance \nwindow.  It  has  also  provided  special  credits  to  major  cities  to  improve  their  environment  by \ninstalling emission-control devices and equipment in power plants and factories and by building \nwater-treatment facilities. It is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power \nsubsector  from  hydropower  and  thermal  power  generation  to  energy  conservation  and \nrenewable energy, particularly in the western region. German development cooperation through \nKfW  has  approved  approximately  $400  million  in  mixed  credits,  mostly  for  power  plants  and \nturbine-modernization  projects.  It  also  supported  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy development. Other bilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits \nin  the  energy  sector  include  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark,  France,  Italy,  Spain,  the  United \nKingdom, and the United States.  \n \n6. \nClose  cooperation  among  development  partners  has  been  pursued  through  regular \nmeetings. 7  ADB  has  established  a  working  relationship  with  the  World  Bank  and  other \nmultilateral and bilateral agencies toward addressing policy issues and coordinating lending and \nTA  operations.  Both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  emphasize  the  importance  of  energy  efficiency \nimprovement,  promoting  clean  energy,  environmental  protection,  and  a  greater  role  for  the \nprivate sector in clean energy financing. Annual aid-coordination meetings are held in Beijing to \nshare strategies.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nADB\u2019s  experience  with  energy  projects  in  the  PRC  has  been  positive.  Projects  are \ngenerally  well  designed  and  smoothly  implemented,  though  front-end  delays  have  occurred  in \nsome  projects.  Success  is  attributed  to  extensive  preparation  prior  to  ADB  intervention,  high \nsense of local ownership, effective leadership in project management offices, and timely policy \nand enterprise reforms. The front-end delays in loan signing and loan effectiveness did not lead \nto  unsatisfactory  performance.  The  Government  has  implemented  reforms  on  investment \nregulations  that  simplify  approval  procedures  and  delegate  some  approving  authority  to \nprovincial  governments.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  the  Government  to  harmonize  the  two \napproval procedures to minimize project start-up and implementation delays. \n \nThe  implementation  performance  of  the  energy  portfolio  is  satisfactory. 8  Project \n8. \ncompletion and performance evaluation reports for ADB-financed projects in the PRC highlight \nthe (i) need to improve financial reporting; (ii) need for more attention to environmental matters; \n\nLessons \n\n                                                 \n6   World Bank. 1998.

Washington, DC. \n7  ADB hosted the 2007 meeting in Beijing in April 2007. \n8  Of  the  seven  recent  loans  under  administration,  one  is  rated  highly  satisfactory,  and  the  remaining  six  are  rated \n\nsatisfactory. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(iii)  advisability  of  using  larger  boiler  turbine  units;  and  (iv)  necessity  for  capacity  building,  not \nonly for project preparation, but also to train staff in operation and management.   \n \n9. \nThe  World  Bank  review  of  experience  in  energy  efficiency  has  shown  that  projects \nshould seek to test a variety of business models to achieve energy savings. In particular, access \nto  appropriate  project  financing  that  supports  energy  service  company  transactions  should  be \nintegral to project design. It suggests that procurement and disbursement procedures should be \nsimplified, as they increase transaction costs and discourage energy efficiency.9 \n \n10. \nThese  lessons  were  taken  into  account  when  designing  and  preparing  the  Project. \nDuring  preparation,  lessons  were  addressed  by  (i)  thoroughly  reviewing  project  readiness  on \nkey  factors  that  may  delay  start-up,  (ii)  carefully  assessing  institutional  capacity  and \nstrengthening measures to improve corporate governance, (iii) providing conservative estimates \nof the expected tariff consistent with existing  policies and practices, and (iv) setting up project \nimplementing units with autonomy for operations and procurement decisions.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  World  Bank.  2004.

It was established in \n1994  and  is  solely  owned  by  the  Government  of  the  PRC.  EXIM  Bank  is  headquartered  in \nBeijing  and  has  over  10  business  branches  and  domestic  representative  offices,  as  well  as \nthree overseas representative offices, in Johannesburg, Paris, and St. Petersburg. It maintains \ncorrespondent relationships with more than 300 overseas banks worldwide. \n \n2. \nEXIM Bank plays an important role in supporting the PRC's foreign trade and economic \ndevelopment.  It  provides  policy  financing  for  exports  as  well  as  for  imports  of  mechanical, \nelectronic, and new high-technology products and equipment, and it has provided assistance for \noffshore construction contracts as well as overseas investment projects. EXIM Bank is the major \nonlending  bank  of  foreign  government  and  international  financial  institution  loans  and  is \nmandated as the sole lending bank for the PRC's concessionary loans. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn  the  face  of  challenges  arising  from  reduced  loan  amounts  offered  by  some  foreign \ngovernments  and  fierce  market  competition  for  traditional  onlending  products,  EXIM  Bank \nrefocused its business philosophy and adopted measures to remain competitive. It took active \nsteps  to  tap  growth  potential  in  the  onlending  business  by  adding  new  countries,  businesses, \nand product varieties to its list. Utilizing foreign funds, EXIM Bank has supported key projects in \ninfrastructure,  medical  care,  education,  and  environment  protection  and  has  contributed  to \nimplementing the national strategy of developing the western region of the PRC. In 2007, EXIM \nBank  signed  onlending  agreements  with  a  total  value  of  $950  million  for  47  projects.  Total \noutstanding loans at end-2007 were worth $18.94 billion. To date, EXIM Bank has onlent loans \nprovided  by  22  foreign  governments  and  five  international  financial  institutions,  including  the \nWorld Bank and European Investment Bank. \n \n4. \nEXIM  Bank  categorizes  its  onlending  activities  into  three  types  depending  on  the \nclassification of the borrower and who is responsible for repayment. It charges a standard fee \nfor onlending. The Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant is classified as \ntype I, wherein a state-owned enterprise (China Huaneng Group) under the State Council bears \nrepayment  obligation.

The financial analysis was \nprepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank Financial Management and Analysis \nof  Projects.1 All  costs  and  prices  are  expressed  in  constant  2009  prices.  The  economic  life  of \nthe Project is estimated at 25 years with residual value assumed for the civil works and land-use \nright.  The  financial  operation  of  the  project  implementing  agency,  Huaneng  Tianjin  IGCC  Co. \nLtd., was projected based on the assumptions described in Appendix 12. The projected financial \nstatements are shown in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nRevenues  from  the  Project  will  be  derived  from  the  sale  of electricity  generated  by  the \npower plant based on projected yearly net generation of 249 gigawatt-hours in 2011 and 1,245 \nGWh from 2015 and the tariff of CNY0.56 assumed in the project feasibility study approved by \nthe National Development and Reform Commission. A tariff in this range is a major factor in the \nProject's viability.  \n \nThe  capital  cost  includes  physical  contingencies  but  excludes  price  contingencies  and \n3. \nfinancial  charges  during  development.  Operating  and  maintenance  costs  include  personnel \nsalaries and welfare costs, plant and equipment maintenance costs, administration, insurance, \ntaxes, and other expenses. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  the  Project  was  calculated  as  shown  in \nTable  A11.1.  The  FIRR  is  6.4%,  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC) \nestimated at 3.7%, and the financial net present value is CNY820.9 million at this WACC. The \nProject  is  considered  financially  feasible.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  robust \nunder various adverse conditions, as shown in Table A11.2. \n \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\nTable A11.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return for \nTianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant \n(CNY million) \n\n \n \nYear \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n\n \nCapital \nCosts \n574.09  \n1,083.09  \n969.83  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nRevenues\n \n \n89.94  \n152.53  \n246.41  \n309.00  \n340.29  \n340.29  \n340.29  \n340.29  \n\n \nOperating \nCosts \n\n \nIncome \nTaxes \n\n \n \n\n1.06  \n9.30  \n20.74  \n28.37  \n32.18  \n32.18  \n32.18  \n42.83  \n\n \n \n125.15  \n253.24  \n440.52  \n565.37  \n627.80  \n627.80  \n627.80  \n627.80  \n\nNet Cash \nFlow After \nTax \n(574.09) \n(1,083.09) \n(935.68) \n91.41  \n173.37  \n228.01  \n255.33  \n255.33  \n255.33  \n244.68  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

It  is  the  managing  partner  of  Greengen, \nwhich in turn established Huaneng Tianjin IGCC Co., Ltd. (HTICL) with the mandate to develop \nthe  Project  and  be  the  implementing  agency  (IA).  This  separate  project  entity  approach  is \nconsidered  prudent  as  it  (i)  brings  transparency,  (ii)  improves  accountability  and  corporate \ngovernance,  and  (iii)  ensures  a  task  force  approach  to  project  development  that  provides \nmanagement focus. The project implementation organization structure is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n1. \n\nChina Huaneng Group \n\nin \n\ninformation \n\ntechnology, \n\n \n2. \nCHNG is a state-owned enterprise (SOE) under the direct jurisdiction of the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and is a leading group in the PRC's power sector. It \nwas established in 1985 with registered capital of CNY20 billion. In December 2002, when the \nPRC's  power  sector  was  reorganized,  CHNG  received  about  one-fifth  of  the  assets  of  the \ndissolved  State  Power  Corporation,  along  with  the  four  other  state-owned  power-generating \ncompanies.1 CHNG has developed into a large group comprised of wholly owned or controlled \nsubsidiaries  with  regional  branches  and  offices  both  in  the  PRC  and  abroad.  CHNG  conducts \nbusiness independently and bears full responsibility for its profits and losses. It has a diversified \nbusiness  portfolio  with  power  generation  at  its  core.  One  of  its  biggest  subsidiaries,  Huaneng \nPower International, is listed on the Hong Kong and New York stock exchanges. \n \n3. \nCHNG lists the following as its business areas: (i) management of its state-owned assets \nand subsidiaries; (ii) investment, construction, operation, and management of power-generation \nassets  and  the  production  and  sale  of  power  and  heat;  (iii)  investment,  construction,  and \ntransportation,  renewable  energy, \noperation  of  businesses \nenvironment  protection,  trade,  and  fuel;  (iv)  businesses  associated  with  foreign  trade  and \ninternational  cooperation;  and  (v)  investment  and  financing  in  domestic  and  international \nmarkets. \n \n4. \nAs  of  end-2008,  CHNG's  total  installed  capacity  was  86  gigawatts  (GW),  and  its  2008 \nelectricity production was 364.5 terrawatt-hours, about 10.5% of the national total, making it the \nlargest power producer in the PRC. Its power plants are located in economically vibrant regions \nwhere  power  demand  is  very  strong.  The  company  attributes  its  success  to  its  strength  in  the \nfollowing areas: (i) advanced equipment, efficient generating units, and steady operations; (ii) a \nhigh-quality employee base and experienced management team; (iii) a standardized corporate \ngovernance  structure  and  scientific  decision-making  mechanism;  (iv)  strategically  located \npower-generating  assets  and  bright  market  prospects;  and  (v)  sound  creditworthiness  both \ndomestically and internationally and rich experience in capital market operation. \n \n5. \nCHNG  has  a  rigorous  and  sound  accounting  system,  internal  control  procedures,  and \nexperienced and qualified financial and internal auditing staff. CHNG is in a position to provide \nto  both  Greengen  and  HTICL  the  guidance  and  monitoring  needed  to  improve  their  financial \nperformance and systems for accounting, internal control, and risk management. \n                                                 \n1  The State Power Corporation was a SOE that held 50% of the total power-generating capacity in the PRC before \npower  sector  restructuring  in  December  2002.  The  four  other  power-generation  companies  that  received  assets \nfrom  State  Power  were  China  Datang  Corporation,  China  Huadian  Corporation,  China  Guodian  Corporation,  and \nChina Power Investment Corporation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n6. \nAs part of its development strategy, by 2010, CHNG will increase its generation capacity \nto over 100 GW. Its sales revenue is projected to reach $10 billion, making it one of the world\u2019s \nlargest 500 companies. CHNG has identified capacity development, technical competence and \ninnovation, and risk endurance among its strategies to become globally competitive.  \n \n\nGreengen Co. Ltd. \n\n2. \n \n7. \nGreengen  was  established  as  a  limited  liability  company  in  December  2005  with \nregistered  capital  of  CNY300  million.  Its  business  involves  researching,  developing,  and \nproviding consulting services on clean coal technology for power plants, as well as constructing, \noperating,  and  managing  power  plants  that  promote  clean coal  technologies  toward  near-zero \nemissions.  The  Project  is  the  initial  undertaking  in  its  development  program,  which  envisions \nputting in place 1,050 MW of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) capacity by 2015. \nCHNG  holds  51%  of  Greengen's  shares,  while  the  other  seven  shareholders2 are  the  major \npower-related SOEs in the PRC, each holding 7% of the shares. \n \n8. \nExecuting Agency's role for the Project, on behalf of CHNG. For the Project, Greengen will \n\nGreengen  will  exercise  supervisory  functions  over  HTICL  and  perform  most  of  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nreview  and  approve  procurement,  contractor  payments,  and  reimbursement \napplications; \nmonitor project implementation; \nreview counterpart fund utilization and the progress of loan utilization; \nreview financial and physical progress reports; \nreview or prepare reports for submission to the Government as necessary; \nreview quarterly progress reports for submission to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB); and \nconduct correspondence with ADB as necessary. \n\nAn  assessment  based  on \n\n \n9. \nfinancial  management  assessment \nthe  completed \nquestionnaire  indicates  that  accrual  basis  accounting  and  PRC  accounting  standards  are \nfollowed. Existing accounting procedures are aligned with regulations and policies issued by the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF). A computerized accounting system is in place, and the company has \na  complete  set  of  accounting  procedures  for  recording  and  processing  transactions.  Internal \ncontrol  is  effective.  Separation  of  functions  for  authorization,  transaction,  recording,  and  asset \nmanagement  is  well  established  under  existing  accounting  procedures.  A  rigorous  budgeting \nsystem  is  uniformly  implemented  within  CHNG,  and  the  budget  contains  both  financial  and \nphysical indicators that are compared with actual performance, which is monitored monthly. The \nsame accounting systems and procedures will be used for the Project. There is no internal audit \ndepartment  in  Greengen  yet,  but  the  internal  auditor  in  CHNG  can  be  designated  to  conduct \ninternal  audit  periodically  or  as  needed.  The  external  audit  of  its  financial  statements  is \nconducted annually by an independent accounting firm designated by CHNG.  \n \n10. \nBeing a newly established entity, Greengen as a company does not have any previous \nexperience in project management or in dealing with international finance institutions. However, \nas most senior staff come from CHNG, its management team has very strong capacity. Training \nin  project  management,  as  well  as  in  ADB's  guidelines  and  procedures  on  procurement  and \ndisbursement  and  on  safeguard  mechanisms,  have  been  identified  as  areas  for  improvement. \nSince Greengen is purely an investment company with no operating revenues in previous years, \n\n                                                 \n2   These enterprises are China Datang Corporation, China Huadian Corporation, China Guodian Corporation, China \nPower  Investment  Corporation,  Shenhua  Group  Corporation  Ltd.,  China  National  Coal  Group  Corporation,  and \nState Development and Investment Corporation. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47\n\nand  with  the  Tianjin  IGCC  project  being  its  first  and  only  project,  it  was  not  considered \nnecessary to assess Greengen on its own profitability and sustainability. Therefore, only HTICL \nwill be assessed in terms of its financial prospects. \n \n\nHuaneng Tianjin IGCC Co. Ltd. \n\n3. \n \n11. \nHTICL was registered as a limited liability company under PRC law in November 2008 \nwith  authorized  share  capital  of  CNY200  million  held  by  Greengen  (75%)  and  Tianjin  Jinneng \nInvestment  Company  (25%).  As  IA,  HTICL  will  be  responsible  for  project  management  and \nimplementation. Consistent compliance with PRC accounting standards and systems is required \nto ensure accurate and timely interpretation of financial performance and that Project costs and \nexpenditures  are  used  economically,  efficiently,  and  for  the  purposes  stated  in  any  loan \nagreement.  The  organization  structure,  functions,  and  financial  management  of  the  new \ncompany  was  reviewed  during  project  processing.  The  organization  chart  of  HTICL  is  simple, \nwith a staff of 114. Accounting systems and processes, as well as internal control procedures, \nare  patterned  after  those  of  Greengen.  HTICL  uses  the  same  accounting  software,  which  can \nproduce the financial statements and reports required by MOF under a special regulation issued \nin  January  2000.  No  historical  audited  financial  statements  are  yet  available  for  review.  The \nproposed Project will be audited by a special auditing agency to be designated by MOF. HTICL \nrecently recruited internal auditors to enhance monitoring and control in the organization. \n \n12. \n\ncertificating contractor payments; \npreparing reimbursement applications; \nmonitoring counterpart fund utilization and the progress of loan utilization; \n\nHTICL's financial management and reporting responsibilities will include  \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv)  maintaining consolidated financial and physical progress reports; \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\npreparing reports for submission to the Government as necessary; \npreparing quarterly progress reports for submission to ADB; and \nconducting all correspondence with ADB. \n\n \nB. \n\nFinancial Performance and Projections \n\n13. \nFinancial  performance  can  be  analyzed  only  for  CHNG.  An  analysis  of  the  company\u2019s \nfinancial statements for the past 4 years was done following ADB's Financial Management and \nAnalysis  of  Projects. 3 The  audited  financial  statements  of  CHNG  show  that  the  company\u2019s \nfinancial condition has been fairly sound except in 2008, when its operations were not spared by \nthe  global  financial  crisis.  That  year  was  very  difficult  for  CHNG,  as  the  costs  of  coal  and \nmaterials sharply increased but the Government kept power tariffs unchanged. As a result, the \ncompany  sustained  a  net  loss  of  CNY6.78  billion  (4.5%  of  sales),  and  net  cash  flow  from \noperating activities decreased by 74% compared with the previous year. From 2005 to 2007, its \nsales  increased  by  52%,  and  net  income  after  tax  increased  by  522%.  Yearly  net  operating \nincome was around 10% of sales, while net income after tax was about 9% in 2007. \n \n14. \nCHNG's  financial  position  was  also  fairly  sound,  with  shareholders'  equity  comprising \nover 40% of its capital structure. However, it is observed that the company has large amounts of \nshort-term debt maintained over the years. If the short-term debts were to be considered in the \ndetermination of its capital structure, the equity position would be about 33% in 2005, dropping \nto 28% in 2008. High short-term debt adversely affected the current ratio, which was less than \n1.0,  with  current  liabilities  exceeding  current  assets.  The  debt-service  coverage  ratio  (DSCR) \nwas also below 1.0 because of payment on short maturities, which account for 45% of total debt. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nAssumptions Used for Financial Projections \n\nHistorical  and  projected  financial  statements  and  key  financial  indicators  are  in \n\nThese  debts  were  incurred  to  fund  rapid  expansion  to  meet  growing  demand  for  electricity  in \nrecent years and to finance the working capital requirements brought about by increasing input \ncosts.  The  national  directive  to  meet  environmental  protection  standards  and  promote  energy \nefficiency also had a toll on CHNG's financial position, and the company thus had to resort to \nmore borrowing in the absence of additional equity injected by the Government. \n \n15. \nSince short-term maturities are being refinanced, the DSCR would be much higher if the \ndebt service data shown in the audited financial statements could be disaggregated to consider \nonly  long-term  debts.  Nevertheless,  the  company  needs  to  carefully  look  into  its  short-term \nliability in relation to its overall capital structure, as the very low current ratio and DSCR indicate \nhigh financial risk in the short run. \n \n16. \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \nC. \n \nChina  Huaneng  Group.  Financial  projections  were  based  on  historical  data  for 2005\u2013\n17. \n2007,  as  2008  was  truly  abnormal  and  cannot  be  regarded  as  a  basis  for  projections.  The \nprojections are consistent with the company\u2019s business program for the next decade and reflect \nCHNG's vision of maintaining its lead in the power generation market in the PRC and promoting \nrenewable and clean energy projects while, at the same time, achieving global competitiveness \nand making inroads into the international energy market. \n \n18. \nCHNG\u2019s revenues will increase from CNY151.37 billion in 2008 to CNY203.44 billion in \n2018,  raising  its  total  assets  from  CNY463.59  billion  to  CNY518.33  billion  in  the same  period. \nThe return on net fixed assets will rise from \u20132.14% in 2008 to nearly 2% in 2018. Although the \ncurrent  ratio  and  debt-service  ratio  are  increasing  gradually,  the  figures  will  still  be  low,  which \nsuggests the need for CHNG to closely examine its funding strategy and debt structure.  \n \n19. \ngradual and sustained improvement in the future financial position of CHNG. \n \n\nKey  financial  accounts  and  indicators  are  shown  in  Table  A12.1.

Ltd.  Financial  projections for HTICL are essentially based \non the impact of the Project on the company's financial statements. The Project is assessed to \nbe financially viable. The financial operations of the project company were projected for 2011\u2013\n2020  based  on  the  major  assumptions  described  below.  The  capital  investment  program \nconsiders  only  the  ADB-funded  project.  Annual  investment  outlays  were  adjusted  using  the \nprojected annual escalation factors used in ADB projects. The projections use an exchange rate \nof  CNY6.83  to  $1.00.  After  project  completion,  no  major  capital  expenditures  are  expected \nthroughout the project life. The expected economic life of the Project is 25 years,  with residual \nvalue assumed for the civil works and land-use right. \n \n21. \nUnder  the  proposed  loan,  HTICL  will  be  required  to  maintain  a  DSCR  of  at  least  1.2 \ntimes, rising to 1.3 times by 2016; a return on net fixed assets of not less than 6.0% from 2015 \nonwards; accounts receivable not exceeding the equivalent of 3 months of sales; and a debt\u2013\nequity  ratio at  a  maximum  of  80:20  until  2015 and  70:30  thereafter.  To  ensure  that  this set  of \nfinancial  covenants  is  translated  into  appropriate  financial  policies  and  measures,  HTICL  will \nprovide ADB each year with its rolling 10-year financial projections, showing how it proposes to \nmeet  the  covenanted  targets.  The  financial  covenants  of  ADB  are  expected  to  be  satisfied \nduring  the  life  of  the  Project.  The  DSCR  is  forecasted  to  be  adequate  throughout.  The  debt\u2013\nequity  ratio  will  be  within  the  prescribed  maximum  limit.  Other  financial  ratios  are  expected  to \nremain satisfactory. \n \n\n1. \n\nRevenues \n\n \nPlant commissioning and trial runs are expected in 2012, with only 20% of the expected \n22. \nyearly volume generated. Thereafter, plant capacity utilization will be 40% in 2013, 70% in 2014, \nand  100%  in  2015.  Yearly  electricity  sales  of  1,245  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  are  expected  from \n2015.  This  sales  volume  considered  the  gross  generation  of  1,470.5  GWh  based  on  normal \nutilization  of  5,500  hours  a  year,  net  of  15.2%  for  station  use  and  loss.  The  plant  utilization \nfactor is 60%. The actual tariff for the plant will be determined by the National Development and \nReform  Commission  at  the  commencement  of  the  plant\u2019s  operation  based  on  the  Project\u2019s \nactual  investment  and  estimated  operating  costs.  The  generation  tariff  of  CNY0.5608  used  in \nthe  approved  feasibility  study  was  assumed.  While  this  tariff  is  crucial  to  the  viability  of  the \nProject, it is lower than the proposed tariff for most approved large wind power projects in the \nPRC.  Table  A12.2,  published  in  March  2009  on  the  China  Wind  Power  website,  shows  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ntariffs  of  20  existing  wind  power  projects,  ranked  from  highest  to  lowest.  Among  those  listed, \nonly  three  projects,  or  15%,  have  tariffs  below  CNY0.6  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  Half  of  them \nobtained  a  tariff  above  CNY0.7/kWh.  The  assumed  tariff  for  this  Project  is  therefore  quite \ncompetitive to those for wind power projects. \n \n\n \n \nProject Name \nZhejiang Cangnan Wind Power Plant \nHebei Zhangbei Wind Power Plant \nLiaoning Donggang Wind Power Plant \nLiaoning Dalian Hengshan Wind Power Plant \nJilin Tongyu Wind Power Plant \nHeilongjiang Mulan Wind Power Plant \nShanghai Chongming Nanhui Wind Power Plant \nGuangdong Shanwei Honghaiwan Wind Power Plant \nGuangdong Nanao Wind Power Plant \n\nTable A12.2: Tariffs for Wind Power Projects Approved by NDRC \nTariff \n(CNY/kWh, \nincluding VAT) \n1.200 \n0.984 \n0.915 \n0.900 \n0.900 \n0.850 \n0.773 \n0.743 \n0.740 \n0.730 \n0.650 \n0.647 \n0.620 \n0.620 \n0.609 \n0.609 \n0.609 \n0.533 \n0.533 \n0.460 \n\n \n \nNo. \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10.

Insurance  is  estimated  at  0.25%  each  year  on \nthe original value of civil works and equipment. Categories of fixed assets are depreciated using \nthe  straight  line  depreciation  method  at  different  annual  depreciation  rates  in  accordance  with \nthe PRC\u2019s guidelines, i.e., 2% for land-use rights, 3.3% for civil works, 5% for equipment, and \n20% for amortization of other intangible assets. A fund for equipment overhaul is withheld each \nyear at 3.3% on the capital cost of equipment.  \n \n\n3. \n\nInterest on Long-Term Debts and Taxes \n\n25. \nInterest  expenses  on  existing  long-term  debts  are  calculated  based  on  prevailing  loan \nterms.  Interest  on  the  ADB  loan  is  calculated  based  on  the  current  London  inter-bank  offered \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51\n\nrate (LIBOR) on the 10-year fixed-interest swap (currently at 4.00%), plus the ADB loan spread \nof  0.20%.  The  loans  from  local  banks  carry  an  interest  rate  of  5.94%,  the  prevailing  rate \nprescribed for long-term loans by the People\u2019s Bank of China. The net income from the Project \nis  subject  to  25%  income  tax.  HTICL  will  retain  after-tax  profit,  and  no  dividends  will  be  paid. \nOther local taxes include VAT of 17% on sales, a city maintenance and construction tax of 7%, \nand an education tax of 3% on VAT. For capital costs, a 5% construction tax on civil works and \n17% VAT on equipment value are adopted. \n \n\n4. \n\nBalance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements \n\n \n\n26. \nThe  projections  are  based  on  the  historical  values  of  the  fixed  assets.  Accounts \nreceivable  is  assumed  to  be  equivalent  to  3  months  of  net  sales.  Accounts  payable  are \nassumed at 3 months of operating expenses, and inventory would be 33% of fuel and materials. \nPrevailing balances of other balance sheet accounts are maintained. \n \n27. \n \n\nA summary of the key financial accounts and indicators of HTICL are in Table A12.3. \n\nTable A12.3: Summary of Financial Projections for \nHuaneng Tianjin IGCC Co.

Capital  costs  were  adjusted  to  eliminate  price  inflation, \ninterest during construction, and taxes. \n \nC. \n \nThe  main  economic  benefit  of  the  Project  is  from  power  generation  to  meet  electricity \n3. \ndemand  from  end  users.  Expected  consistent  demand  growth  for  electricity  in  Tianjin  and  the \nNorth  China  Power  Grid,  to  which  the  Project  will  be  connected,  means  the  Project  will  meet \nnew  demand  rather  than  substitute  for  power  from  any  existing  generation  capacity.  Analysis \nused  conservative  estimates  of  the  actual  benefits.  Lower  forecast  for  generation,  and \nconservative  in-plant  use  and  marginal  transmission  and  distribution  loss  of  15.21%  of \ngenerated  electricity,  formed  the  basis  for  incremental  net  energy  supply  of  1,245  gigawatt-\nhours  per  year  to  end  users.  This  represents  a  56%  load  factor,  or  an  average  load  of  142.1 \nmegawatts.  \n \nEconomic  benefit  was  calculated  using  a  semilog 2  electricity  demand  function. \n4. \nIncremental benefits were quantified based on end users' willingness to pay (WTP). Consumer \nsurplus\u2014the difference between what one is willing to pay for a commodity and the amount one \nis  actually  required  to  pay\u2014was  estimated  at  CNY0.752  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  using  a \nsemilog function.  \n \nThere  are  positive  environmental  benefits  from  avoided  pollution\u2014annual  emissions  of \n5. \n43  tons  (t)  of  particulate  matters,  1,237  t  of  sulfur  dioxide,  3,325  t  of  nitrogen  oxide\u2014from  a \ntraditional  coal-fired  thermal  power  plant  as  the  alternative  energy  source.  Among  these \nenvironmental  benefits, the  most  prominent  ones  are  (i)  improved  human  health  from  avoided \nmorbidity  and  mortality  from  fine  particulates,  (ii)  improved  human  welfare  from  improved \nvisibility and reduced damage to materials from avoided air pollution, and (iii) positive impacts \non environmental resources from avoided emission of carbon dioxide. For the evaluation of the \nenvironmental benefit to human health and welfare, the \"benefit transfer method\" suggested in \nADB\u2019s  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts:  A  Workbook 3  is  used  for  this \nassessment,  and  these  benefits  were  included  in  the  estimation.  However,  complete \nquantification  and  estimation  of  all benefits  from  the  Project  were  not possible  for  lack  of  time \nand resources, among other reasons. The total benefits in this analysis can thus be interpreted \nas conservative estimates.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

Consequently,  following  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA) \napproval  by  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  in  July  2007,  it  has  undergone \nadditional  rigorous  scrutiny  from  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  which \napproved  the  Project's  feasibility  report  only  in  May  2009.  However,  the  approved  feasibility \nreport is based on the same parameters of the Project upon which the EIA report was prepared. \nThis appendix provides the status of the project implementation and evaluates its environmental \ncompliance with the environmental management plan included in the EIA report. \n\nB. \n\nBackground  \n\n2. \nThe  Project  consists  of  developing  a  250  megawatt  (MW)  integrated  gasification \ncombined  cycle  (IGCC)  power  plant  and  a  research  center  to  further  research  polygeneration \noptions, especially to pilot test hydrogen production and fuel cell power generation. The project \nis  located  in  Tianjin  Harbor  Industrial  Park  in  Tanggu  district  of  Tianjin.  The  scope  of \nconstruction work includes \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\na coal gasifier with a processing capacity of 2,000 tons per day (The coal gasifier \nused is a two-stage dry pulverized coal gasifier. The production process includes \ncoal  grinding  and  drying,  pulverized  coal  compression  and  feeding,  coal \ngasification,  slag  removal,  dust  removal,  wet  scrubbing,  ash-flushing  water \ntreatment, and wastewater treatment); \ngas  turbine  and  steam  turbine  combined  cycle,  consisting  of  one  171  MW  gas \nturbine, one 110 MW steam turbine, and a waste heat boiler; \na  synthesis  gas  (syngas)  purification  system,  with  a  processing  capacity  of \n160,739 newton cubic meter per hour (Nm3/h); \na sulfur recovery system (The Shell-Paques biological desulfurization process is \nused  to  remove  hydrogen  sulfide  in  the  raw  gas;  its  sulfur  recovery  capacity  is \n8.27 tons per day); \na flaring system (In case of operation failure, syngas can be flared; the torch is \n80 meters high and 900 millimeters in diameter); \nother  items  including  an  air-separation  facility  with  a  capacity  of  43,497  cubic \nmeters  per  hour,  water  supply,  power  supply,  an  ash-removal  system,  a \nwastewater-treatment and -discharge system, a water recycling system, a boiler \nwater supply system, and a fire water system; \na  storage  and  transport  system,  including  coal  transport,  a  storage  and \ndistribution  system,  an  emergency  ash  yard,  an  on-site  temporary  solid  waste \nyard, an oil tank, and an oil pump room; \ntemporary workers\u2019 accommodation; and \na permanent office and residential building.  \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n \nProject Implementation \n\nProject  construction  was  formally  launched  on  6  July  2009  with  some  pre-construction \n3. \nactivities.

HTICL has sent the EIA report and EMP to all companies \nand organizations involved in the construction of the Project, requiring them to comply with the \nEMP  through  construction  contracts.  Meanwhile,  each  construction  company  is  required  to \nprepare  a  separate  EMP  for  their  construction site  in  accordance  with  the  Project's  EMP.  The \nEMU and the contractors are responsible for implementing environmental mitigation. \n \n6. \nmonitoring are detailed in Figure A14. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure A14: Environmental Management and Monitoring Structure \n\nTianjin Water Bureau \nTanggu EPB \n\nTianjin Soil Erosion \nControl Station \n\nEnvironmental \nMonitoring Station \n\nTanggu EPB\n\nTianjin EPB\n\nGreengen Co.\n\n  \n   \n\nEPB = Environmental Protection Bureau. \nSource: Project Implementing Agency. \n\n \n7. \nThe  Tianjin  and  Tanggu  environmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  are  responsible  for \nmonitoring air and water quality, noise, and solid waste in the project area through the Tanggu \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Station.

The  monitoring \nfrequency  of  the  parameters  as  proposed  in  the  EIA  changed  following  discussion  with  the \nExecuting  Agency.  In  the  PRC,  the  common  practice  among  power  plants  is  to  conduct \nenvironmental monitoring at the end of project construction, just before project acceptance. For \nthis  Project,  environmental  monitoring  is  planned  to  be  conducted  biannually  throughout  the \nconstruction period (Table A14). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A14: Summary of Monitoring Plan During Project Construction \n\nConstruction \nAir quality \nNoise  \n\nSolid waste \n\nAuthority \nLocal EPB \nLocal EPB \n\nLocal EPB \n\nMonitoring Parameter \nTSP \ndecibels \nDisposal of hazardous and \nnon-hazardous waste \n\nMonitoring Frequency \nBiannually \nBiannually \n\nBiannually \n\nBiannually \n\nSoil loss  \n\nTianjing Soil loss \nControl Station \nEPB = environmental protection bureau, TSP = total suspended particles. \nSource: Environment impact assessment report, 2007. \n\nSoil loss \n\n \n9. \nSince  the  construction  of  main  project  components  (coal  gasification  island  and  power \ngeneration  island,  etc.)  is  expected  to  pick  up  momentum  from  2010,  the  environmental \nmonitoring will be closely supervised with regular missions. The IGCC monitoring framework for \nits operational stage is identical to that recommended in the EIA document.  \n\nConclusion \n\nE. \n \nDuring 2009, preparatory work for project construction was completed, and construction \n10. \nwas limited to small civil works with very minor environmental impact. Environmental mitigation \nmeasures  such  as  tree  planting,  road  pavement,  and  water  spray,  etc.,  were  undertaken  to \nminimize  environmental  impact.  The  EMU,  EMP,  and  monitoring  framework  for  construction \nhave been established to ensure the protection of the environment. There was no environmental \ninfringement  record  in  2009.  In  general,  project  construction,  in  2009,  strictly  followed  the \nrequirements  of  the  project  EIA  report.  Project  implementation  is  going  well  in  terms  of \nenvironmental safeguards. The Asian Development Bank will continue to monitor environmental \nsafeguards with regular missions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n58 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Loan \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry and Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant  \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department / Energy \nDivision \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant Project is a 250 megawatt power plant to provide base-load \nelectric  power  generation  to  the  local  power  grid.  The  Project  will  generate  substantial  positive  environmental  benefits  by \nreducing  air  pollution  and  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  such  as  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  when  compared  with  replacement \nconventional coal-fired power plants. The Project will have local, regional, and global benefits from avoided particulate matter, \nsulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide, CO2, and other air pollutants. The Project supports the People's Republic of China (PRC) \n11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  2006\u20132010,  which  emphasizes  resource  conservation  and  environmental  protection  and  gives \npriority to improving energy efficiency and developing cleaner energy sources. The Project will support 11th FYP targets for (i) \nreducing SO2 emissions by 10% by reducing coal consumption for power generation and (ii) improving energy efficiency by \n20%  through  highly  efficient,  cutting-edge  technology.  The  Project  supports  the  goals  of  improving  energy  efficiency  and \nresource  utilization  outlined  in  the  China  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan  2005  and  the  Decision  of  the \nState  Council  on  Enhancing  Energy  Conservation  (2006)  No.  28,  which  emphasizes  energy  conservation,  particularly  in \npower  generation.  The  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  2006\u2013\n2008  strategic  priority  of  managing  the  environment,  as  well  as  the  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  PRC  strategic \ndevelopment objective of improving the environment.  \n\nB.

Key Issues  \n \nThe Project intervenes to reduce poverty in an indirect manner by conserving energy and reducing emissions in the region.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThere is no pro-poor design in the Project.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA large power generation company, the Huaneng Tianjin IIGCC Co. Ltd (HTICL), is the primary beneficiary of the Project. The \nsecondary  beneficiaries  are  factories  in  the  industrial  park.  The  tertiary  beneficiaries  are  people  in  the  industrial  park.  No \npotential  needs  and  constraints  are  found  among  stakeholders  in  terms  of  social  development  or  in  accessing  the  benefits \nand services of the Project. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nThe  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Ministry  of  Finance,  HTICL,  Tianjin  Environment  Protection  Bureau, \nTianjin Harbor Industrial Park Management Committee, experts from the Tianjin Environmental Protection Research Institute, \nand people from local companies  were consulted during project preparation. No social concerns  were presented during the \nconsultation process.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.

It is a rare, if not the first, loan project without \nformal  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC). \nThe project team has adopted an innovative approach for tracking internal approvals in the PRC \nand  its  inclusion  in  the  country  program,  as  well  as  to  address  key  issues  in  processing,  as \ndetailed below.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nProject Preparatory Technical Assistance. Project preparatory TA accompanies loan \ninclusion in the country assistance pipeline. Small-scale TA for $200,000 was approved in 2008 \nto illustrate the strong interest of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in integrated gasification \ncombined  cycle  technology  and  provide  urgent  processing  momentum.  This  resulted  in \nsatisfactory  preparation  such  that,  soon  after  the  Project's  inclusion  in  the  program,  loan  fact-\nfinding was completed in May 2009.   \n \nAdvanced  Contracting.  The  Project  was  expected  to  have  fast-track  implementation \n3. \nupon feasibility report approval, the timing of which was unclear due to the demonstration nature \nof the Project. In view of delays in its inclusion in the country program and uncertainties about \nthe  timing  of  approval  of  the  feasibility  report,  ADB  management  approved  the  advanced \ncontracting  in  August  2008  to  allow  procurement  to  follow  ADB's  procurement  guidelines  and \nthus be eligible for ADB financing when the Project gets included in the pipeline.  \n \n4. \nOnlending  Issues.  The  Project  is  implemented  by  a  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE) \nwithout provincial government support. The ADB loan to a SOE without provincial government \nonlending created a big challenge as the Ministry of Finance is reluctant to onlend directly to an \nSOE without very strict counter guarantees. The introduction of the Export-Import Bank of China \n(EXIM  Bank),  a  policy  bank  of  the  Government  with  expertise  in  similar  onlending  operations, \nhas resolved this issue.  \n \nC. \n\nProject Implementation Readiness  \n\n \nTable A16: Project Readiness Filters \n\nStatus \n\nKey Readiness Filters  \n\n1.
