By  amplifying  the  benefits  of  the  country\u2019s  first \nexpressway  network,  the  project  will  contribute  to  one  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  key \ndevelopment goals, which is to develop the country into a regional trading center between the \nEast  and West.  It  will  also  improve  access  to  economic  opportunities,  as  well  as  basic  social, \nhealth, and education facilities. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nAfter  the  end  of  its  three  decades  of  civil  conflict  in  May  2009,  Sri  Lanka  achieved  \neconomic  growth  exceeding  8%  annually  in  2010  and  2011.  The  economy  slowed  to  6.4%  in \n2012 due to weak external demand, drought, and floods, but it is expected to edge up in 2013 \nand  2014.3 Sri  Lanka\u2019s  strategic  location  at  the  crossroads  of  regional  maritime  trading  routes \nhas  contributed  to  its  growth.  The  transport  sector  contributed  12%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product  in  2011,  which  compares  to  7.9%  in  2005.  To  fully  utilize  the  country\u2019s \nstrategic location in the trading routes, the government has focused on developing five strategic \nglobal hubs (aviation, naval, knowledge, commerce, and energy).4 Public investments are being \nmade  to  developing  several  mega-infrastructures,  including  Colombo  seaport,  Katunayake \nairport,  Hambantota  seaport,  Hambantota  airport,  and  an  expressway  network  connecting  the \ninternational trading facilities.  \n \n4. \nThe  government  envisages  Western  Province,  with  its  rich  natural  and  human \nresources,  as  a  regional  center  hub  and  Southern  Province  as  a  strategic  area  on  the \ninternational trading corridor complementary to Western Province. Western Province drives the \ncountry\u2019s economy, contributing more than 45% of national gross domestic product in 2010. It is \nalso the  most  densely  populated  province  in Sri Lanka  and  has the  highest  vehicle ownership \nrate.  Southern  Province,  with  the  second-highest  vehicle  ownership  rate  in  the  country,  is \nclosely integrated with Western Province through physical and economic connections. With the \nfunction  of  international  hub  being  developed  in  Colombo  and  Hambantota  of  Western  and \nSouthern  provinces,  respectively,  the  country\u2019s  future  sustainable  growth  demands  an \nintegrated  inland  transport  system  (and  particularly  in  the  southern  region)  to  efficiently  move \npeople and goods. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Road  Project  Preparatory  Facility,  funded  by  ADB,  was  utilized  to  undertake  project  preparatory  activities, \nincluding preparation of detailed design and bidding documents.

Road  transport \n5. \naccounts  for  95%  of  passenger-kilometers  and  98%  of  freight  ton-kilometers.  With  its \ncomprehensive  road  network  comprising  about  96  km  of  expressway,  11,922  km  of  national \nroads,  15,975  km  of  provincial  roads,  and  80,000  km  of  local  roads,  the  country\u2019s  population \nand centers  of  economic  activity  are  well  covered. The  average  vehicle ownership rate for  Sri \nLanka  is  estimated  at  about  152  vehicles  per  1,000  persons  in  2011  after  average  annual \ngrowth  of  11.4%  since  2007.  It  is  estimated  that  to  maintain  the  current  levels  of  transport \nservices, road capacity would need to be doubled every 8\u201310 years.  \n \n6. \nThe  transport  sector\u2019s  most  significant  accomplishment  in  connecting  the  international \ntrading  facilities  was  the  commissioning  of  the  Southern  Expressway  on  27  November  2011. \nThe Southern Transport Development Project laid the foundations for modernizing the country\u2019s \ntransport sector by completing a 96 km expressway, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka.5  After the \nexpressway  was  opened,  the  travel  time  between  Kottawa  of  Western  Province  and  Galle  of \nSouthern  Province  was  reduced  from  5  hours  to  1.5  hours.  Aside  from  the  Southern \nExpressway, three additional projects in the southern region are ongoing to further develop the \nexpressway network: (i) Outer Circular Highway, (ii) Colombo\u2013Katunayake Expressway, and (iii) \nPinnaduwa\u2013Godagama Expressway. In the long term, the government plans gradually to extend \nthe expressway network toward the northern and eastern regions so that a trunk road network \nwill be established comprising well-connected expressways and national roads.6 \n \n7. \nWith the insertion of an expressway network and expansion of major trading facilities, a \nnumber  of  challenges  are  emerging  for  the  road  transport  system.  The  access  routes  to  the \nSouthern Expressway are usually congested. The roads connecting to the interchanges do not \nhave sufficient capacity to absorb and distribute the expressway traffic throughput. This problem \nwill  be  exacerbated  when  the  three  new  expressway  sections  are  completed.  The  investment \ninto  improving  the  capacity  of  access  routes  remains  inadequate  because  (i)  the  road  sector \ncompetes for budget allocation with such other sectors as education, social, and health; and (ii) \nthe fund-raising is inadequate in both the public and private sectors. Even with sufficient budget, \nthe utilization would be less than optimal due to outdated design and construction technologies.  \n \n8. \n Limited capacity of road agencies for developing and managing the road sector assets \nis another cause of the connectivity problem. First, connectivity needs were not fully envisaged \nat  the  time  of  planning  the  expressway  network.  An  integrated  plan  to  ensure  connectivity \nbetween  the  expressway  and  local  transport  networks  was  not  adequately  prepared.  Second, \nthe  design  standards  and  procedures  have  not  been  updated  to  address  the  requirements  of \ntraffic  flow  in  expressway  interchange  areas  and  populated  areas,  as  well  as  to  incorporate \nmeasures  on  climate  change  adaptation,  maintenance,  and  road  safety.  Third,  the  traffic \nmanagement  on  routes  with  heavy  traffic  is  not  effective.  Finally,  the  road  safety  policies  and \nregulations need to be enforced in their engineering and nonengineering aspects. \n \n9. \nTo address road connectivity challenges in the southern region, the flows of passengers \nand  freight  need  to  be  facilitated  in  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  manner.  This  requires \nimmediate  actions  on  two  aspects:  (i)  improving  the  capacity  of  the  access  routes  to  the \nexpressway  network,  and  (ii)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  road  agencies  in  developing  and \nmanaging  the  road  sector  assets  by  preparing  a  long-term  connectivity  improvement  plan  that \n                                                \n5  ADB.  1999.

Colombo. \n\n\fincludes  expressway  extensions,  national  highway  improvement,  traffic  management,  and \npublic transport systems. To implement the actions, the government is working in parallel with a \nnumber  of  development  partners,  including  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the \nWorld  Bank,  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  China,  the  China  Development  Bank,  and  ADB.7 The \ngovernment  in  particular  requested  ADB  to  provide  loans  to  finance  the  proposed  Southern \nRoad Connectivity Project to be implemented by RDA. \n \n10. \nADB  and  the  government  agreed  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  that \nADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  transport  sector  will  contribute  to  the  sector  outcome  of  improving \nnationwide  connectivity  for  the  movement  of  people  and  goods.8 ADB  is  financing  four  road \nprojects  to  achieve  this  outcome,  but  most  of  these  are  in  the  northern  and  eastern  regions.9 \nAlthough  not  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2012\u20132014, 10 the  proposed \nproject  will  complement the  ongoing projects  in supporting the  sector  outcome.  Its  objective is \nalso fully  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  sector  strategy  to  establish  a modern transport  system \nthat will accelerate economic growth while reducing travel time and cost and improving safety. \nIn  the  future,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  focus  on  (i)  relieving  traffic  congestion  in  the  urban  areas \nand on the trunk roads, (ii) improving basic connectivity for the lagging regions and for important \nlinks,  and  (iii)  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  road  maintenance  scheme  at  national  and \nprovincial levels. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe impact of the project will be  an efficient road transport in  the southern region. The \noutcome will be improved connectivity between the expressway network and the local transport \nnetwork in the southern region.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  will  deliver  two  outputs:  (i)  improved  capacity  for  about  33.5  km  of  key \n12. \nnational  highways  linking  the  expressway  network  in  the  southern  region,  and  (ii)  enhanced \ncapacity  of  RDA \nin  ensuring \nimplementation readiness. The outputs will be achieved through:  \n\nin  planning  expressway  connectivity \n\nimprovement  and \n\n(i) \n\nimprovement.  This  will  improve  five  priority  national \nNational  highway \nhighways  providing  connectivity \nthe  Southern \nExpressway:  (a)  B295  (2.5  km,  Moratuwa\u2013Piliyandala),  (b)  B389  (2.1  km, \nRatmalana\u2013Mirihana), (c) B157 (12.4 km, Southern Expressway\u2013Matugama), (d) \nA004  (2.1  km,  Kirulapona\u2013Homagama),  and  (e)  B084  (14.4  km,  Kesbawa\u2013\nPokunuwita).

The government will \nfinance  taxes,  duties,  road  maintenance,  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  about  $25 \nmillion. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n15. \nThe  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years;  straight-line,  commitment-linked  repayment;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized into the loan); and such other terms and conditions to be agreed \nin  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  Based  on  this,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  15.75 \nyears  and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.10%  per  annum.  The  government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \n\n \n\n\ffacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n16. \nThe  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  of  2.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n75.0 \n70.0 \n5.0 \n25.0 \n100.0 \n\nShare to Total (%) \n75.0 \n70.0 \n5.0 \n25.0 \n100.0 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \nSpecial Funds resources (loan) \n\nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n17. \nthe project administration manual.11 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nMay 2013\u2013December 2018 \n30 December 2018 \n\nNational Steering Committee \nChair: Ministry of Ports and Highways \nMembers:  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning,  represented  by  the \nExternal  Resources,  National  Planning,  Budget,  and  Project \nMonitoring and Management departments  \nMinistry of Ports and Highways \nRoad Development Authority \nColombo, 55 staff \nInternational competitive \nbidding \nProject implementation \nconsultants (QCBS) \nExpressway connectivity \nimprovement plan (QCBS) \nWorks and consulting services \n\n3 contracts \n662 person-\nmonths \n297 person-\nmonths \n\n$ 53.81 million \n\n$ 4.36 million \n\n$ 4.72 million \n\nLoan proceeds to be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Government of Sri Lanka. \n\n \n\n                                                \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe engineering design has been carried out for all project roads based on site condition \n18. \nsurveys  and  field  investigations.  The  required  improvement  works  are  optimized  for  economy \nand  construction  efficiency  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  and  national  design \nstandards.  The  construction  method  will  utilize  proven  technology  using  standard  materials \ncompatible with local  conditions.  All  civil  works  contracts  will  also  include 5-year  performance-\nbased  maintenance  to  secure  maintenance  and  promote  private  sector  development.  The \nproject  roads  have  been  assessed  for  climate  vulnerability  according  to  the  National  Climate \nChange  Adaptation  Strategy  for  Sri  Lanka.12 Key  risks  assessed  include  (i)  shifting  of  climate \nzones, (ii) floods, (iii) landslides, (iv) rise in sea level, and (v) drought exposure. The design of \nthe project roads includes provisions for embankment rising and drainage enhancement. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nEconomic  viability.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines.13 The principal benefits calculated are savings in vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime.14 The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  18.3%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nindicates  that  the  project  has  an  EIRR  above  12%  even  with  adverse  variation  in  costs  and \nbenefit streams. Therefore, the proposed improvements are economically viable. In addition to \nthe quantified benefits, the project will bring significant benefits to overall regional development. \nOpening of the Southern Expressway has significantly reduced travel times along the corridor. \nThe  improvement  of  project  road  sections,  which  provide  connectivity  to  the  Southern \nExpressway,  will  enhance  overall  network  connectivity  of  the  southern  region.  Industrial \ndevelopment will also benefit from the improved national roads, because the investment climate \nwill  be  upgraded  by  better  connectivity  to  the  supply  sources  and  markets  outside  the  region. \nWhile such benefits are not quantified, these are the envisaged impacts of the project in relation \nto economic development and poverty reduction. \n \n20. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  unit  cost  related  to  operation  and  maintenance  of  the \nproject  roads  will  decrease  after  construction  because  the  road  condition  will  be  improved.  In \nthe long term, the required operation and maintenance costs for project roads represent only a \nvery  small  proportion  of the  budget  allocation  (about  0.3%  of the  RDA maintenance budget  in \n2012). In view of recent trends, an adequate budget allocation is expected. The government has \nearmarked a budget amount for 5 years of performance-based maintenance, which covers both \nroutine  and  periodic  maintenance.  It  is  reasonable  to  expect  the  project  to  be  financially \nsustainable. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n21. \nPolicy  and  legal.  RDA,  the  implementing  agency,  is  responsible for  development  and \nmaintenance of the national highway network. RDA was established as a statutory authority with \na separate legal personality by the Road Development Authority Act in 1981. RDA\u2019s chairperson \nreports to the secretary of the Ministry of Ports and Highways (MOPH). \n \n                                                \n12 Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Environment,  Climate  Change  Secretariat.

Manila. \n14 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fInstitutional  capacity. MOPH  and  RDA  have  sufficient  capacity,  past  experience,  and \n22. \ninstitutional  strength  for  procuring  the  civil  works,  selecting  consultants,  administering  the \ncontracts, and managing the overall project implementation.  \n \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment was carried out for RDA. \n23. \nRDA has prior and ongoing experience of implementing ADB-funded projects. It has satisfactory \ncapacity  in  project  financial  accounting  and  in  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  RDA  has  a \ndedicated  project  accounting  and  finance  team  with  suitably  qualified  accountants.  RDA  will \nestablish and maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources \nreceived  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project,  thus  ensuring  an  adequate  audit  trail.  The \ngovernment\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department will annually audit the project accounts and related \nfinancial statements in accordance with international auditing standards.  \n \n24. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines. The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended from time to time), the Declaration of \nAsset  and  Liabilities  Act,  No.  1  of  1975,  and  the  Permanent  Commission  to  Investigate \nAllegations  of  Bribery  and  Corruption  Act,  No.  19  of  1994  provide  a  legal  basis  to  deal  with \nbribery  and  corruption.  The  auditor  general  monitors  procurement  by  the  agencies,  giving \nspecial attention to procedural propriety in procurement.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOPH, and RDA.  \n \n25. \nproject administration manual (footnote 11). \n\nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n26. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  It  is  estimated  that  1.1  million  residents  in  the \nproject areas are direct beneficiaries while the 4.6 million residents in three districts (Colombo, \nKalutara,  and  Galle)  that  the  Southern  Expressway  spans  are  indirect  beneficiaries.  During \nfocus  group  discussions  held  with  both  men  and  women,  most  respondents  stated  that  the \nproposed  road  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  will  help  create  new  economic  and  employment \nopportunities by improving links to markets, production centers, and other areas with economic \nopportunities. Access to public and social service facilities such as government agencies, health \ncenters, and schools will also be improved. The project will have a short-term impact on poverty \nreduction, as the rural poor in project-impacted areas will be employed for construction. These \nwill increase livelihood opportunities for those who now depend largely on occasional, uncertain \nemployment.  The  contracts  for  civil  works  will  include  measures  to  ensure  safe  and  healthy \nworking  environments  for  both  men  and  women  laborers.  The  contractors  will  be  required  to \nimplement appropriate measures with respect to equal pay for equal work for men and women, \nhealth and safety at construction sites and labor camps, and an awareness program for workers \non prevention of sexually transmitted infections.15 \n \n27. \nGender.  The  country  now  ranks  midway  on  the  United  Nations  Gender-related \nDevelopment  Index.  Nationwide,  the  adult  literacy  rate  for  females  is  89.3%  as  compared  to \n94.5% for males. Women in project areas typically participate in household activities and some \nare  frequent  road  users  for  the  likes  of  transporting  children  to  school  and  visiting  markets. \nDuring  consultations,  women  indicated  that  improved  road  conditions  and  connectivity  will \nprovide better access to health services, higher levels of education, economic opportunities, and \nsocial  interactions.  Time  savings  due  to  enhanced  road  conditions  increase  the  likelihood  of \n\n                                                \n15 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmore time being spent on productive activities, health care, and self-development. The project \nwill aim to employ 15% women in road maintenance activities. It will provide employment skills \ndevelopment while enhancing personal financial management capacity for all women employed \nin civil works.16 No adverse impact on women due to the project is envisaged.  \n \n28. \nA gender action plan has been prepared for the project in order to (i) maximize women\u2019s \naccess to project benefits such as by integrating features accommodative to the elderly, women, \nchildren,  and  the  disabled  into  road  design,  including  paved  and  raised  sidewalks,  paved \nshoulders,  and  road  safety  features;  (ii)  provide  opportunities  to  increase  women\u2019s  skills, \nincomes,  and  participation  in  decision  making;  and  (iii)  minimize  social  vulnerability.  Practical \nand implementable gender mainstreaming activities have been incorporated into the project.17 \n \nHIV/AIDS.  Sri  Lanka  is  recorded  to  have  a  low  HIV  prevalence  rate,  although  the \n29. \nnumber of reported cases has grown over the years. That is due in part to improved access to \ntesting facilities. Countrywide responses have included establishment of the National STD and \nAIDS  Control  Program,  which  helps  to  refurbish  health  clinics  and  establish  outreach  and \nawareness  programs.  The  project  has  incorporated  measures  to  mitigate  HIV/AIDS  risks  by \nundertaking an awareness program for contractors at construction sites and for project-affected \ncommunities  at  prominent  village  locations.  Awareness-raising  activities  for  project-affected \npersons  will  be  conducted  separately  for  men  and  women  in  order  to  address  gender-specific \nissues.  \n \n30. \nHuman  trafficking.  Respondents  during  the  social  impact  assessment  did  not  identify \nhuman trafficking as a significant issue in the project area, although improved road connectivity \nmay  trigger  movement  away  from  the  project  area  to  other  parts  of  the  country.  Civil  works \ncontractors  are  anticipated  to  source  laborers  locally  and  will  not  require  migrant  workers. \nAffected communities will be provided with awareness training on human trafficking. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n31. \nStatement (2009). All five project roads will be widened, which will create significant impact. Due \nto the  linear  nature  of that  impact, the majority  of  affected households will  lose  not  more than \n10%  of their  productive assets.  Some  commercial  structures  will  need  to  be  demolished since \nvarious  stretches  of  the  project  roads  traverse  urban  areas.  Impact  has  been mitigated  where \npossible  by  reducing  the  width  of  the  shoulder.  Three  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared \nfor  anticipated  land  acquisitions,  and  two  due  diligence  processes  regarding  land  acquisition \nhave  been  undertaken  to  verify  previous  acquisitions  by  the  government.  All  these  have  been \ncompleted  in  accordance  with  government  regulations. 18 For  the  three  roads  requiring  land \nacquisition, it is estimated that 2,188 households including 9,641 persons will be affected. About \n488  households  comprising  approximately  2,150  persons  will  experience  significant  impact. \nAssistance will be in place to restore livelihoods to the same or better conditions compared with \nlivelihood  conditions  at  the  pre-project  level.  For  the  two  roads  where  the  government  has \nalready  acquired  land,  due  diligence  identified  15  households  due  interest  payments.  The \ngovernment has allocated funds and these payments will be made prior to project approval. Civil \n                                                \n16 Women\u2019s participation in civil works for the ongoing ADB-funded National Highways Sector Project is between 6% \n\nand 10%.  \n\n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Resettlement plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fworks  may  proceed  after  compensation  and  assistance  have  been  fully  paid.  Resettlement \nplans were prepared and disclosed on ADB website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009),  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1950,  and  the \nNational Involuntary Resettlement Policy introduced in 2001. The project management unit has \nan experienced team implementing the resettlement plans and will be supported by the RDA\u2019s \nEnvironment  and  Social  Division.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples and is therefore designated Category C. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment  \n\nforests  or  natural  habitat  areas.  None \n\n \n32. \nThe  project  scope  includes  improvement  of  existing  roads  to  two-lane  or  four-lane \nstandard.  The  roads  are  located  in  urban,  suburban,  and  agricultural  areas  for  most  of  their \nfall  within  protected  or \nlengths  with  minimal \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas.  The  project  is  therefore  classified  category  B  in  accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Road-specific  initial  environmental  examination \nreports, including environmental management plans, have been prepared and disclosed on the \nADB  website.  Anticipated  impacts  under  the  project,  which  are  mostly  restricted  to  the \nconstruction  stage,  comprise  typical  impacts  associated  with  road  construction,  such  as \ngeneration  of  dust,  noise,  and  construction  waste;  temporary  disruption  of  traffic;  soil  erosion \nfrom exposed surfaces; siltation of water bodies; and drainage issues. These can be managed \nby adopting suitable mitigation measures described in the initial environmental examination and \nroad-specific  environmental  management  plans  and  monitored  through  the  environmental \nmonitoring  plan.  Both  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans,  along  with  specific \nclearance  requirements  of  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  for  each  road,  will  be  included \ninto  the  bidding  documents  for  civil  works.  Local  communities  and relevant  stakeholders  have \nbeen  consulted  during  project  preparation,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been \nestablished to address concerns during project implementation. Financial and human resources \nnecessary for redressing grievances will be covered under the project.19 \n \n33. \nThe  project  management  units  under  RDA  are  responsible  for  ensuring  proper \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans.  The  Environmental \nand  Social  Division  under  RDA  will  provide  technical  guidance  and  support  to  the  project \nmanagement unit in monitoring environmental compliance by the contractors. Additional support \nfor  day-to-day,  site-level  monitoring  and  reporting  will  be  provided  by  the  supervision \nthe \nconsultant\u2019s \nenvironmental  management  plan  (if  required)  will  be  made  by  the  environmental  specialist \nunder the supervision consultants and reviewed and approved by the Environmental and Social \nDivision.  Annual  environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \ndisclosure  on  the  ADB  website  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  An \ninitial  coordination  cum  training  workshop  will  be  organized  by  the  project  management  units \nwith technical support from the Environmental and Social Division. This will be conducted for the \ncontractors  and  supervision  consultants  before  commencing  construction  works  in  order  to \nagree on modalities for implementing the environmental management and monitoring plans and \nto carry out necessary monitoring and reporting activities. \n\nincludes  an  environmental  specialist.

Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.20  \n \n35. \nThe  key  risk  is  of  frequent  implementation  delay  due  to  the  need  to  prepare  detailed \nengineering  design  and  to  prolonged  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.
