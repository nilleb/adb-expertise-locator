The proceeds of the issuance, combined with Georgian Railway\u2019s \nown resources, will be used to roll over Georgian Railway\u2019s existing $500 million in Eurobonds, \nand partly finance capital expenditures in relation to the company\u2019s ongoing railway modernization \nproject. The proceeds of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) subscription will be earmarked up \nto (i) $4 million for capital expenditures related to the upgrade of two existing substations; and (ii) \n$46 million for the partial refinancing of debts (existing Eurobonds) incurred to improve existing \nrailway lines as part of the ongoing modernization project, covering preliminary works, subgrade \nworks, the upgrade of associated infrastructure and electric traction supply lines, and railway track \nenhancements.  The  proceeds  will  not  finance  any  tunnel-related  works  and  any  capital \nexpenditures, upgrades, or repairs linked to new railway lines. The instrument is targeted to be \nissued in June 2021. The bonds are expected to be recognized as green bonds in compliance \nwith  the  International  Capital  Markets  Association\u2019s  Green  Bond  Principles.1 The  instrument  is \nexpected to be the first-ever green bond to be issued by a state-owned enterprise in the South \nCaucasus, and the second from a Georgian issuer. ADB\u2019s subscription to the bond as an anchor \ninvestor  is  expected  to  boost  investor  confidence  in  the  issuance,  particularly  given  market \nuncertainties  because  of  the  ongoing  pandemic,  and  thereby  help  ensure  financial  and \noperational sustainability of Georgian Railway. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. Georgia lies at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, serving as an \nimportant section of international trade and transport corridors, such as the Transport Corridor \nEurope  Caucasus  Asia  corridor,  as  well  as  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) Railway Corridor 2: Mediterranean\u2013East Asia and CAREC Railway Corridor 6: Europe\u2013\nMiddle East\u2013South Asia.2 Establishing sustainable and efficient transport networks that improve \nconnectivity  with  neighboring  trading  partners  can  lead  to  increased  trade flows  and  improved \ncompetitiveness.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2019\u20132023, 3  Georgia  can \nleverage such advantages to strengthen its position as an international gateway by upgrading its \ntransport network in a sustainable manner. \n \n4. \nProject design. Georgian Railway\u2019s main objective for the proposed bond issuance is to \nrestructure its liability profile by rolling over its $500 million in Eurobonds that had been issued \nprimarily  to fund  the company\u2019s  ongoing modernization project.  Since  2010,  Georgian  Railway \nhas  been  working  on  a  multiyear,  phased  modernization  of  its  network.  The  project  includes \nimproving  the  bottleneck  in  a  40-kilometer  mountainous  region,  which  delays  operations  and \naccelerates the depreciation of tracks and rolling stock. (Confidential information deleted.) Once \nthe modernization project, involving the entire rail network, is completed in 2023, it is expected to \n\n1  International Capital Market Association. 2018.

Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Georgia,  2019\u20132023\u2014Developing  Caucasus\u2019s  Gateway  to  the  World. \n\n \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fincrease  freight  capacity  from  27  million  to  48  million  tons  per  annum,  increase  passenger \ncapacity from 4.5 million to 8.0 million per annum, increase the maximum cargo speed, reduce \nthe transport time of freight trains, and improve transport safety by reducing derailment risk. Once \nthe ongoing capital expenditure is completed, improved and expanded railway operations may \nhelp reduce carbon emissions through cargo and passenger modal shifts from more greenhouse \ngas-intensive  road-based  transport  to  rail.  Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  project  will  not  be \neligible  for  climate  financing.  This  is  because  it  is  not  possible  to  meaningfully  quantify  the \nincremental greenhouse gas emission reduction accruing out of the modernization project, due to \nthe absence of a comprehensive traffic survey and demand analysis study on the likely extent of \nmodal shift in the project area.4 However, the bond issuance will be in compliance with the Green \nBond Principles (footnote 1).5 \n \nTo fund the modernization project in phases, Georgian Railway initially issued $250 million \n5. \nin Eurobonds in 2010, which were subsequently refinanced in 2012 by a $500 million Eurobond \nissuance with a bullet repayment in 2022. The proposed bond issuance would be primarily used \nto roll over these existing Eurobonds and thus help reprofile Georgian Railway\u2019s balance sheet \nby  ensuring  much-needed  liquidity,  which  is  critical  for  Georgian  Railway\u2019s  sustainability  and \ncompletion  of  its  modernization  project.  Given  the  capital-intensive  nature  of  the  ongoing \ninvestment  (with  long  payback  period),  Georgian  Railway\u2019s  current  operating  cash  flow  is  not \nsufficient to cover such bullet repayment while at the same time maintaining the momentum of \nongoing capital expenditures. The role of ADB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment  as anchor investors  to  support  the issuance  of the  green  bonds  will  thus  enable \nGeorgian Railway to repay its upcoming liabilities, and to maintain the momentum of modernizing \nthe entire railway network, which is vital to the country. \n \n6. \nOf Georgian Railway\u2019s total cargo throughput in 2020, transit accounted for 50%, exports \nfor  10%,  and  imports  for  23%.  Local  shipments  accounted  for  only  17%.  Because  Georgian \nRailway\u2019s mainline railway network is a key link in the shortest route from the Caspian Sea and \nCentral Asia to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean basin, it is uniquely positioned to capitalize \non  trade  between  Europe,  the  Caspian  Sea  region,  and  Central  Asia.  Therefore,  Georgian \nRailway\u2019s modernization project is critical for Georgia to serve as a gateway for trade with Europe \nnot only for other Caucasus countries but also for neighboring economies, which form an integral \npart of key regional cooperation and integration initiatives. \n \n7. \nADB and Georgian Railway will execute an agreement stipulating specific requirements, \nincluding  development  outcome,  safeguards  and  social  dimensions,  gender  elements,  and  an \nanticorruption policy. Georgian Railway will commit to undertake a number of improvements in \nsafeguards and gender design to comply with ADB\u2019s requirements. These actions are expected \nto have a demonstrational effect across the transport sector in Georgia and significantly add value \nto one of Georgia\u2019s largest employers, with more than 12,000 employees as of the end of 2020. \nThe project will support Georgian Railway\u2019s efforts to access international capital markets at a \ntime  when  liquidity  is  uncertain  because  of  the  negative  economic  effects  of  the  coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic.  \n\n \n\n4  Under the joint Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) methodology for tracking climate change mitigation finance \ntypology, railways are an eligible mitigation activity; however, the methodology also requires a clear demonstration \nof a modal shift from a higher-carbon mode, as well as the consequent estimations for greenhouse gas emission \nreductions.  \n\n5  Green bonds projects (following the Green Bonds Principles) do not necessarily qualify as climate finance projects \n\n(following the joint MDB methodology), as the latter have more stringent eligibility criteria.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nOne-ADB approach. The project has been developed and processed by ADB\u2019s Private \n8. \nSector Operations Department \u2013 in close collaboration with Central and West Asia Department \n(CWRD).  The  project  opportunity  was  identified  during  CWRD\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA) 6 \nsupport to Georgian Railway and the Government of Georgia to formulate a long-term business \nstrategy  for  rail  passenger  services,  optimize  passenger  operations,  and  finalize  a  fair  and \ntransparent  public  service  contract  between  Georgian  Railway  and  the  government.  Once \ncompleted, the TA is expected to identify a road map for Georgian Railway to reduce its financial \nburden stemming from loss-making, yet socioeconomically desirable, passenger rail services and \nimprove  its  sustainability.  The  support  for  the  bond  issuance  thus  complements  CWRD\u2019s \nupstream  engagement  with  Georgian  Railway.  ADB\u2019s  Georgia  Resident  Mission  is  involved  in \nprocessing the project and engaged in managing ADB\u2019s relationship with Georgian Railway. \n \nGender equality. Few women are employed in transport (2% in construction and 4% in \n9. \ntransport and communication) in Georgia.7 Transport usage, trip patterns, and mobility often have \nsignificant  gender  constraints.  Even  when  women  have  access  to  public  transport,  it  is  often \nconsidered  unsafe  as  sexual  harassment  on  public  transport  has  been  reported  as  a  growing \nproblem  in  many  countries  in  CAREC. 8  Key  gender  issues  considered  in  designing  and \nimplementing the ongoing modernization project include access, safety, and provision of equal \njob opportunities in transport. Gender elements have been incorporated into the project to align \nwith ADB requirements. \n \n10. \nIssuer. Georgian Railway is Georgia\u2019s sole railway company operating in Georgia and is \nwholly  owned  by  the  Partnership  Fund  JSC,  Georgia\u2019s  sovereign  investment  fund.  Georgian \nRailway  provides  freight  services,  transshipping  a  variety  of  cargo,  including  crude  oil,  oil \nproducts, ores, and grains, principally from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia in the east to the \nBlack Sea in the west. Georgian Railway also provides passenger services. Its total infrastructure \nincluded a 1,436-kilometer railway network (of which 97% is electrified), 1,323 bridges, 40 tunnels, \n31  passenger  stations,  and  99  cargo  stations  as  of  the  end  of  2020.  Georgian  Railway  is  a \nvertically  integrated  natural  monopoly  that  owns  and  operates  the  tracks,  stations,  other \ninfrastructure and rolling stock comprising Georgia\u2019s entire national railway system, as well as the \nland adjoining the tracks. Georgian Railway is authorized to set its own tariffs independently of \ngovernment  approval.  The  company\u2019s  mainline  rail  network,  together  with  that  of  Azerbaijan \nRailways  (a  closed joint  stock  company),  forms  the  Caucasus  railway  corridor,  which  is  a  key \nsegment of the Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia corridor, as well as the CAREC Railway \nCorridor 2: Mediterranean\u2013East Asia and CAREC Railway Corridor 6: Europe\u2013Middle East\u2013South \nAsia (footnote 2). Three of Georgian Railway\u2019s lines terminate at the Black Sea, at the Georgian \nport cities of Batumi, Kulevi, and Poti, with easy on-shipment of transit cargo to the Mediterranean \nbasin and Europe.  \n \n11. \nCOVID-19 impact. In early 2020, the government ordered a temporary suspension of rail \npassenger  operations  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  As  a  result,  ridership  decreased \nsignificantly. In 2020, Georgian Railway transported only 0.9 million passengers compared with \n3.0 million in 2019. The pandemic slowed the pace of some of Georgian Railway\u2019s modernization \nworks. However, the temporary restrictions placed by the government in 2020 on air and overland \ntransport have positively impacted Georgian Railway\u2019s freight transport volumewhich was 11.1 \nmillion tons in 2020 compared with 10.9 million tons in 2019 \n \n\n6  ADB. 2020.

The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  provision  of  a  safer,  more \n13. \nefficient  transport  corridor,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Georgia \n(footnote 3) to develop efficient and sustainable transport and storage systems, and with ADB\u2019s \nCAREC 2030 transport strategy,9 to improve service levels and operation efficiency of railways. \n \n14. \nOutcome.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcomes:  Georgian  Railway\u2019s  financial \nsustainability and railway operations improved through the issuance of Eurobonds, increasing the \nvolume  of  cargo  and  passengers  transported,  reducing  travel  time  for  freight  trains  from  the \nAzerbaijan border to the Georgian port of Batumi, and improving train speeds in gorge sections \nof the railway network project. \n \n15. \nOutputs. The outputs of the project are (i) Georgian Railway\u2019s Eurobonds fully issued and \nsubscribed,  (ii)  Georgian  Railway\u2019s  network  improved  with  freight  and  passenger  capacity \nincreased and gender responsiveness improved through installation of gender-awareness boards \nat train stations, (iii) gender inclusiveness in Georgian Railway\u2019s workplace enhanced, and (iv) \nopportunities for women in transport improved. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  partnership  strategy.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030, 10  which  prioritizes  addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing  inequality,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  making  cities  more  livable,  and \nmeeting  cross-border  infrastructure  needs,  which  is  aligned  with  the  operational  priority  of \nfostering regional cooperation and integration. ADB support for the project is in line with ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Georgia,  2019\u20132023  (footnote  3)  as  the  project  promotes \neconomic  development  and  makes  urban  areas  more  livable  through  more  efficient  transport. \nSupporting the first green bond issuance from a state-owned enterprise in the South Caucasus \nwill boost the financial sustainability of Georgian Railway, which will in turn help to address the \nultimate goal of the country partnership strategy to expand trade, improve regional connectivity \nand  logistics,  create  more  jobs,  and  combat  poverty  through  the  development  of  economic \ncorridors in Georgia, as Georgian Railway is an important part of such corridors. \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \n17. \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CAREC  2030  transport  strategy  (footnote  9),  which  targets  increasing \nsustainability, and with its strategic pillar on railways, which focuses on developing effective rail \ninfrastructure, and alleviating cross-border bottlenecks via increased freight capacity and railway \nnetwork  length.  The  project  will  thus  benefit  connectivity  in  CAREC  Railway  Corridor  2: \nMediterranean\u2013East Asia and CAREC Railway Corridor 6: Europe\u2013Middle East\u2013South Asia. The \nproject is consistent with the Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations through its support \nfor an essential transport infrastructure provider.11 \n \n\n9  ADB. 2020.

The transaction benefits from lessons from ADB\u2019s \n18. \nsuccessful green bond projects across Asia and the Pacific, including Georgia.12 One of the key \nlessons from prior transactions is the importance of identifying credible issuers who are committed \nto  strictly  adhering  to  the  criteria  required  for  green  bond  issuances.  Georgian  Railway  is \ncommitted  to  the  sustainability  agenda  and  is  seen  as  an  appropriate  partner  for  ADB.  This \ntransaction benefits from ADB\u2019s internal knowledge of the commercial structuring of and market \nfor corporate bonds, including green bonds\u2014learnt from prior similar transactions. \n \nD. \n \n19. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n(Confidential information deleted.) \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\n \n\n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\n20. \n \nE. \n \n21. \n\nF. \n \n22. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  comprise  an  investment  of  up  to  $50  million  in  Eurobonds  to  be \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nissued by Georgian Railway.  \n \nB. \n \n24. \nFinancial additionalities. ADB\u2019s support\u2014as an anchor investor\u2014to Georgia\u2019s first-ever \ngreen bond issuance in the railway sector is expected to fill a critical market gap. The issuance \ncomes  at  a  time  of  significantly  uncertain  investor  confidence  in  and  appetite  for  Georgian \nRailway\u2019s proposed bonds because of economic and market disruptions caused by COVID-19. \nADB\u2019s participation will improve the commercial viability of the issuer by helping it raise required \nlong-term financing to meet its near-term obligations and extend the tenor of its debt profile\u2014a \ncritical requirement for it to continue its ongoing modernization plans unhindered. More generally, \nADB will add value by helping further develop the hitherto limited green bond market in the South \nCaucasus  by  ensuring  that  the  bond  issuance  complies  with  international  market  standards. \nADB\u2019s involvement will also help raise the profile and utility of green instruments and standards \nin the region. \n \n25. \nNonfinancial additionalities. ADB will require Georgian Railway to adopt environmental \nand social standards in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Georgian Railway \nwill also be required to strengthen gender design features in its operations to tackle key gender \nequality issues. As one of the largest employers in Georgia, Georgian Railway has the potential \nto not only have a demonstrational impact on other transport industry actors but also serve as a \n\n12 ADB. 2020.

Georgian Railway will improve the safety of female \nworkers and passengers by adopting gender-responsive communication at train stations and by \nintroducing a corporate policy supporting procedures and awareness campaigns against sexual \nharassment and on other gender issues in the transport sector, including the need for a respectful \nwork environment and zero tolerance for gender-based violence. The project is expected to lead \nto  increased  regional  trade  and  connectivity  via  optimized  logistical  chains  and  improved \ntransport. ADB will continue to work with Georgian Railway through the approved TA (provided \nthrough ADB\u2019s sovereign operations) to formulate a long-term business strategy for rail passenger \nservices and design a fair and transparent public service contract, which will contribute to a more \nefficient and sustainable rail transport system. \n \nC. \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\n(Confidential information deleted.)  \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  B),  and \nindigenous peoples (category C).13 Safeguard Policy Requirement 4 for general corporate finance \nand existing facilities is applicable. \n \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \n32. \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse \nimpacts.

A corporate audit of \nGeorgian Railway\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) and an environmental \nand  social  compliance  audit  of  existing  facilities  and  activities  to  be  financed  by  ADB  were \nundertaken  by  an  external  third  party  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. \n \n33. \nThe existing facility audit noted the presence of hazardous materials and waste associated \nwith  the  use  of  oil  containing  polychlorinated  biphenyl,  asbestos,  and  asbestos-containing \nmaterials in existing infrastructure. Georgian Railway will develop a program to phase out the use \nof polychlorinated biphenyl throughout its operations, which will include procedures for handling \nand storing the waste material. The company will develop an asbestos management plan to avoid, \nminimize, and mitigate the potential environmental and health and safety risks associated with \nthe disturbance, removal, or demolition of structures containing asbestos or asbestos-containing \n\n13 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nmaterials.  The  audit  determined  that,  while  no  additional  land  has  or  will  be  acquired  for  the \nactivities  being  financed  by  ADB,  there  are  potential  risks  associated  with  activities  that  may \ncause economic displacement. Georgian Railway will be required to upgrade its ESMS in line with \nADB\u2019s requirements to incorporate involuntary resettlement screening, categorization, and impact \nmitigation, and to report to ADB on overall land acquisition status. Use of ADB proceeds will not \nbe committed to activities likely to generate economic displacement until adequate assessment \nand  management  planning  have  been  put  in  place  to  avoid,  minimize,  and/or  compensate  for \nimpacts.  No  impacts  are  anticipated  on  indigenous  peoples  or  vulnerable  ethnic  minorities \nbecause of ADB-financed activities. \n \n34. \nGeorgian  Railway  engages  contract  labor  in  its  operations  but  does  not  have  a  formal \nsystem  to  monitor  labor  conditions  to  ensure  that  they  are  compliant  with  local,  national,  and \nInternational  Labour  Organization  standards.  However,  Georgian  Railway  does  have  internal \noccupational  health  and  safety  policies  and  procedures  that  apply  to  all  workers.  The \nimplementation  of  the  occupational  health  and  safety  policies  and  procedures  requires \nstrengthening to ensure that the system is compliant with relevant standards and that the resulting \nsafety  culture  is  cascaded  to  contractors.  Georgian  Railway  will  develop  a  contractor \nmanagement plan to fill these gaps and will augment its community consultation measures and \ncommunity grievance mechanism in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nEffective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender \n35. \nmainstreaming. Gender analysis conducted during due diligence indicated that Georgian Railway \nfollows Georgian labor laws, which include principles on equality, as well as railway regulations \non rights and obligations of railway passengers. However, Georgian Railway\u2019s corporate policies \ndo  not  contain  specific  gender-sensitive  references  or  provisions  to  tackle  gender  issues.  In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998), 14 Georgian  Railway  has \nincorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business \nactivities. Key features of the gender action plan are (i) improving the safety of female workers \nand passengers along the railway lines with gender-responsive communication at train stations, \nand (ii) developing an anti\u2013sexual harassment policy that will be implemented together with an \nawareness campaign for staff and contractors on sexual harassment and other gender issues in \nthe  transport  sector.  Georgian  Railway  will  increase  opportunities  for  young  women  in  its \ninternship program to further attract women into the transport sector and create jobs for women \nthrough the project. Georgian Railway will submit periodic reports to ADB on implementation of \ngender measures. \n \nGeorgian Railway will (i) comply with ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure \n36. \nthat investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by \nnational laws and regulations, and (iii) strengthen its ESMS to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. The ESMS will \nset  out  requirements,  as  applicable,  for  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  measures  to \ncomply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001).15 The ESMS will contain requirements, as applicable, for information \ndisclosure and consultation with project-affected people, following ADB requirements. Georgian \nRailway will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures \ntaken.16 \n \n\n14 ADB. 1998. Policy on Gender and Development. Manila. \n15 ADB. 2003.
