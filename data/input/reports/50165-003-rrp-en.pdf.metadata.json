It will \nalso develop common infrastructure on about 66 hectares (ha) of new urban land to enable the \nsafe and sustainable expansion of human settlements and commercial activities. The project will \nalso support capacity development to improve flood risk management and the delivery of urban \nservices. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBhutan\u2019s development strategy has a focus on the potential of growth centers in the south \nnear the Indian border to boost export-oriented industrial development. Bhutan\u2019s Eleventh Five-\nYear Plan, 2014\u20132018 identified Phuentsholing as a regional growth center that could be safely \nexpanded through the construction of flood protection works and planned urbanization.2 Located \non two major trade corridors developed under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nframework, Phuentsholing handles more than 80% of Bhutan\u2019s trade and is the country\u2019s largest \ncommercial  and  industrial  hub  and  main  trading  gateway  with  India.  Phuentsholing  is  also \nBhutan\u2019s second most populous city, with 25,000 residents, and is anticipated to grow by 5% per \nyear subject to land availability.3 \n \nLand scarcity is a key growth constraint for Phuentsholing, which is physically confined by \n4. \nsteep and unstable Himalayan foothills, the Amochhu River, and an international border. The city \nis  vulnerable  to  precipitation-  and  earthquake-triggered  landslides  and  has  been  significantly \nimpacted  by  flood  damage  and  riverbank  erosion.  The  impacts  of  flash  floods  triggered  by \nmonsoon rains are being experienced more frequently because of urban expansion into unsafe \nareas,  increasingly  dense  urban  development,  the  loss  of  natural  ground  cover,  and  climate \nchange.4  Since  2002,  the  Government  of  Bhutan  has  worked  to  mitigate Phuentsholing\u2019s  land \nconstraints and exposure to geophysical and flood hazards. It has constructed flood and erosion \ndefenses along the Amochhu and Omchhu rivers and planned for city expansion away from the \nmountain slopes to flat areas suitable for residential, commercial, and recreational uses.5 \n \n5. \nThe  Phuentsholing  Township  Development  Project  supports  the  government  with \nachieving  these  mitigation  efforts  by  strengthening  flood  defenses  and  constructing  safe,  new \nurban areas. The ongoing project was approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of \n\n \n\n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2018.

Urban Development Plan, 2002\u20132017: Phuentsholing, Bhutan. Thimphu. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDirectors on 5 June 2018 and was financed by a concessional loan of $28.74 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  and  a  grant  of  $24.26  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \n(Asian  Development  Fund).  Under  the  project,  about  66  hectares  of  vacant  riparian  land \nimmediately  adjacent  to  the  existing  city  along  the  left  bank  of  the  Amochhu  River  are  being \ndeveloped,  based  on the Amochhu  Development  Master  Plan.6  The executing agency  is  Druk \nHolding  and  Investments  Limited  (DHI),  which  is  a  state-owned  entity,  and  the  implementing \nagency is the Construction Development Corporation Limited (CDCL), a fully owned subsidiary of \nDHI. The closing date for the loan and grant under the ongoing project is 31 December 2025. \n\n6. \nSpecifically,  activities  under  the  ongoing  project  are  (i)  constructing  river  walls  and \ncommon urban infrastructure in a new greenfield area, (ii) raising land, (iii) installing a flood early \nwarning  system,  (iv)  implementing  a  flood  management  plan,  and  (v)  helping  the  government \nprepare subsequent phases of development. To implement and administer the new urban area, \nthe  government  is  applying  a  new  integrated  project  modality  by  entrusting  DHI  and  CDCL  to \nimplement and sustainably operate and maintain the river defenses, building plots, and common \nurban infrastructure.  The  ongoing  project  will  also build  the  capacity  of  both the  new  township \noffice and Phuentsholing municipality to ensure that coordination and high service standards are \nachieved,  while  ensuring  the  disaster  resilience  of  the  facilities  with  proper  monitoring  and \nmaintenance. \n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The project remains highly relevant in a \n7. \npost covid-19 strategic context. Efforts are being made to restart the economy and mitigate the \nadverse  impact  of  the  lockdown,  particularly  on employment  of the  vulnerable  population.  The \nadditional  financing  will  provide  needed  support  for  the  long-term  growth  prospects  of  the \neconomy. The construction of the river walls and new township is generating local employment, \nthe new commercial area will stimulate the local economy and create service sector jobs, and the \nnew town will be equipped with new hospitals and clinics that offer health services and medical \nsupplies. \n\nOngoing project performance. The ongoing project is performing well. It was rated on \n8. \ntrack  since  project  effectiveness  and,  as  of  20  August  2020,  had  achieved  96%  of  projected \ncumulative contract awards ($37.6 million) and exceeded cumulative disbursement targets ($22.8 \nmillion, 135% of projections). The ongoing project is also on track to achieve the project outputs. \nIn terms of physical achievements, output 1 activities (flood and erosion protection measures) are \nunder way, and the construction of the wall and backfilling are due to be completed in July 2021. \nOutput  2  activities  (municipal  infrastructure)  will  start  in  April  2021,  supported  by  output  3 \n(installation of township management systems), which will be initiated in the first quarter of 2022. \nThe  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  of  the  ongoing  project  is  proceeding \nsatisfactorily.  All  risks  detailed  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  are  being \nmanaged successfully. \n \n9. \nReason for additional financing. The additional financing will finance cost overruns on \nthe ongoing project. Since the project appraisal, the cost increase is attributed to two civil works \npackages: the river protection works, and the urban common infrastructure. The river protection \nworks contract was awarded in July 2018 and was 37% higher than the engineer\u2019s estimate.7 The \nhigher bid price was the results of the delayed approval of the ongoing project and the lowest \n\n \n\n6  Government of Bhutan, Druk Holding and Investments Limited. 2017. Amochhu Development Master Plan. Thimphu. \n\nThe master plan is aligned with the Phuentsholing Structure Plan 2013\u20132028. \n\n7  The contract was awarded on 18 July 2018 to the second lowest responsive bid, which was 37% higher than the \n\nengineer\u2019s estimate ($45.09 million compared with the engineer\u2019s estimate of $32.80 million). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fbidder withdrawing after its specialist equipment for wall construction was no longer available.8 \nThe contract\u2019s price adjustments (labor, steel, cement, fuel, and lubricant) have also been higher \nthan  expected  at  project  appraisal,  increasing  the  contract  price  by  12%  compared  with  the \nstandard 5% price contingency provided. The updated contract amount also allows for upgrading \na short section of the Omchhu River\u2019s banks (360 meters) which is contiguous with the ongoing \nworks (4 kilometers).9 Overall, the river protection works contract increased from $33 million to \n$48 million (145%). The common urban infrastructure package has also increased since project \nappraisal,  when  only  its  feasibility  level  design  and  cost  estimate  were  available.  The  detailed \ndesigns and engineer\u2019s estimate are now completed, and the package\u2019s cost has increased from \n$11.9  million  to  $20.8  million.  The  asset  management  system  costs  also  increased  with  the \nfinalized  cost  estimate  and  incorporating  the  maintenance  equipment  costs  of  $2.1  million. \nAdditional  financing  includes  10%  contingencies  as  the  river  protection  works  package  is  still \nunder construction and the common urban infrastructure package has yet to be awarded. The \nactivities  under  the  additional  financing  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  31  December  2025, \nwhich is the closing date of the loan and grant under the ongoing project. \n \nEligibility criteria for additional financing. The additional financing project meets the \n10. \neligibility criteria for additional financing. The overall project (i) remains technically feasible and \neconomically  viable;  (ii)  is  accorded  high  priority by the  government;  (iii)  is  consistent  with the \nproject\u2019s  development  objectives;  (iv)  is  consistent  with ADB\u2019s  country  partnership strategy for \nBhutan,  2019\u20132023;10  and  (v)  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  (a) \nmaking cities more livable; (b) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability; and (c) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.11 The  additional  financing  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for \nBhutan, 2020\u20132022.12 \n \n11. \nSuitability  of  using  additional financing.  Additional  financing  is  the most  appropriate \nway to fund the cost overruns to complete the project in the most efficient way while providing the \ntownship with the requisite physical and institutional resilience against the impact of the natural \ndisasters. The project will be completed within the ongoing project completion date. Through this \napproach,  current  effective  implementation  arrangements\u2014such  as  the  project  steering \ncommittee,  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  project  implementation  unit,  and  civil  works \ncontractor  and  supervisor\u2014will  be  maintained  to  ensure  a  high  degree  of  readiness  for  the \nimplementation of the additional financing. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n8  The circulation of the report and recommendation of the President  to the Board  awaited the consultations by the \ngovernment with a neighboring country. Meanwhile, the executing agency chose to delay contract award until ADB \nconfirmed the Board consideration date. \n\n9  The Omchhu River is a tributary of the Amochhu River that flows through Phuentsholing. The additional financing \nwill extend the Omchhu River protection wall constructed under the ongoing project and within the existing project \nboundaries. \n\n10 ADB. 2019.

The  project  is \naligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  balanced  and  sustainable  development  of  human \nsettlements  ensured  (footnote  2)  and  (ii)  smart  growth  principles  applied  in  planning  and \ndevelopment13. The project will have the following outcome: Phuentsholing\u2019s urban area protected \nfrom floods and expanded with improved amenities and services. 14 \n \nThe outputs of the overall project will remain unchanged. These are (i) flood and erosion \n13. \nprotection  measures  installed,  (ii)  municipal  infrastructure  constructed,  and  (iii)  township \nmanagement systems installed. The additional financing will finance cost overruns experienced \nacross all three project outputs. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nDuring  preparation  of  the  ongoing  project,  ADB  helped  the  government  incorporate \nintegrated  urban  planning  principles  that  address  the  social,  economic,  environmental,  and \nphysical aspects of the new township into the township master plan. During implementation, ADB \nhas continued to support DHI and CDCL with improving the detailed designs of the common urban \ninfrastructure. ADB has also supported DHI and CDCL with (i) streamlining coordination between \nthe new township and Phuentsholing municipality to enhance service delivery, connectivity, and \nlinks  with  the  existing  city  and  ongoing  and  future  multisector  ADB  projects;  (ii)  developing  a \nsustainable  and  effective  model  for  township  management;  (iii)  ensuring  sustainability  by \nembedding  the  project  within  longer-term  strategic  plans  for  the  wider  economic  area;  and \n(iv) ensuring that strong marketing machinery is in place to attract investors. ADB\u2019s support has \nresulted in development of a strategic action plan (SAP) for sustainable township management. \nThe plan was updated and elaborated during preparation of the additional financing, based on \nprogress  achieved and outstanding tasks associated  with developing  a legal,  institutional,  and \nadministrative  framework  for  the  new  township.  The  project  will  improve  the  capacity  and \ncompetitiveness  of  the  Phuentsholing  urban  area  and  complement  the  efforts  of  the  ADB-\nsupported South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program, which has enabled greater \nconnectivity and facilitated trade between Bhutan and other countries in the region.  \n \nD. \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe overall project is estimated to cost $93.00 million (Table 1).

ADB  will \nfinance  100%  of  adaptation  costs.16  The climate  change risk  is  high  because  of  the  increased \nfrequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events. In response to these risks, the project \ndesign  incorporates  increased  river  training  wall  levels  and  embankment  level  to  account  for \nincreased flood flows. \n \nE. \n \n19. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nsection III of the PAM (footnote 15). The implementation arrangements for the overall project will \nremain  unchanged.

Readiness is high as additional financing \nis for the ongoing project where the first civil works package is already under construction and the \nsecond major civil works has been tendered. The implementation consultants, recruited in 2016, \nwill continue to support the overall project. The COVID-19 pandemic has not affected the project\u2019s \nimplementation  arrangements  or  overall  cost.  A  nationwide  lockdown  was  imposed  by  the \ngovernment on 11 August 2020 and project construction works were stopped for 38 days. The \nadditional financing implementation period of 5 years provides adequate cushion for the lockdown \ndelay and the project is programmed to be completed within the existing implementation period. \nBased on government orders, health and safety guidelines and standard operating procedures \non construction sites have been developed and are being strictly implemented, with compliance \nmonitoring being ensured by the project manager. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \n21. \nThe additional  financing is  to  bridge  cost  overruns  within the  existing  project scale and \nscope. Due diligence was carried out on the economic viability and the financial sustainability of \nthe whole project. \n \nA. \n \n22. \nThe ongoing project and the additional financing remain technically feasible and comply \nwith Bhutanese and international engineering standards, local regulations, and conditions. The \nstrengthening  of  existing  river  walls  along  the  Omchhu  River  (footnote  9)  maintains  the  same \ndesign as the river protection works being constructed under the ongoing project, the design of \nwhich included a thorough evaluation of hydrological, hydraulic, and sediment transport conditions \nto assess probable flood levels; the projected impact of climate change; sedimentation; and scour. \nThe section of the Omchhu River in which the works will take place is an engineered channel and \nthe  works  will  not  extend  beyond  the  width  of  the  existing  river  channel.  Urban  infrastructure \ndesign  incorporates  smart  technology  to  monitor  water  supply  and  wastewater  operations  to \nensure maximum efficiency in the management of assets. Since the same climate baseline and \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nprojections are still applicable and the expected impacts are the same as for the ongoing project, \nthe  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  prepared  during  project  appraisal  remains \napplicable. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic  analysis.  Increased  land  value  accounts  for  about  75%  of  total  project \nbenefits,  with  reduced  flood  damage  to  infrastructure  and  increased  benefits  from  water  and \npower supply accounting for the remaining 25%. Given several uncertainties related to the project, \na  risk  modeling  framework  was  used  to  estimate  the  value  of  the  project  benefits.  With  the \nadditional  financing  included,  the  project\u2019s  mean  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  has \nreduced  from  11.28%  at  project  appraisal  to  9.87%.  The  economic  analysis  indicates  that  the \noverall project is economically viable. The project\u2019s economic feasibility is sensitive to unfavorable \nchanges  in  investment  costs  and  economic  benefits.  However,  within  the  expected  range  of \nvariations  of  these  key  variables,  the  EIRR  remains  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital of 9% unless investment costs increase by 10.20% or benefits decrease by 8.54%. The \nproject\u2019s  EIRR  is  less  sensitive  to  changes  in  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The \npoverty impact ratio was estimated at 4.1%. It is assumed that occupants of residential housing\u2014\nincluding  social  housing  reserved  for  the  poor\u2014will  value  the  new  land  they  occupy  at  higher \nlease  rates  than  would  be  payable  to  the  government,  primarily  because  the  quality  of  urban \ninfrastructure and services will be much better than can be found elsewhere in Bhutan. \n \n24. \nFinancial analysis. The overall project\u2019s financial sustainability assessment was updated \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.  The  project\u2019s  cash  inflows  mainly  comprise  revenues \ngenerated from leasing the developed land, which the government will promote to investors with \nfinancial  and  regulatory  incentives.  Revenues  will  also  include  water  supply,  wastewater \ntreatment, and solid-waste management service charges. The financial analysis found the project, \nincluding the additional financing, to be financially viable. The net present value is positive and \nthe internal rate of return of 2.64% is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 1.39%. \nThe financial internal rate of return is sensitive to adverse changes in variables such as increase \nin  construction  cost,  increase  in  O&M  costs,  and  decrease  in  lease  revenues.  However,  the \nproject remains financially viable under most adverse scenarios, except for a decrease of lease \nrates of more than 23%. The project supports the establishment of the new township\u2019s institutional \narrangements and implementation of the SAP, which includes a time-bound plan for the O&M.17 \nFurther, the urban works package includes 5 years of O&M, which will further mitigate the financial \nsustainability risk. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThis project will develop a modern township designed on sustainable principles of equity, \nlivability, and competitiveness. The project is expected to provide opportunities for investment, \ncreate  jobs,  and  relieve  existing  housing  pressures.  Integrated  planning  and  infrastructure, \nstrengthening  DHI  institutionally,  and  creating  a  township  management  unit  will  ensure  the \nsustainability  of  investments  in  a  climate-  and  disaster-resilient  township.  The  project\u2019s \ncommercial approach, support for investor outreach, and strong focus on  O&M will ensure the \nnew  township\u2019s  financial  and  operational  sustainability  (para.  24).  Moreover,  expanding  the \nmunicipality\u2019s tax base will help it finance its own investments and operations. \n\nSustainability \n\n17 The PAM includes the draft SAP, which is to be approved by the  Ministry of  Works and  Human  Settlements.  To \nmitigate the risk of delays in SAP approval, the SAP has been included in the loan agreement and will be monitored \nthrough quarterly progress reports. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nD. \n \n26. \nFinancial  management.  An  updated  financial  management  assessment  has  been \nconducted  for  the  CDCL,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.18  The  financial  management \nassessment found that the CDCL has adequate financial management capacity to (i) record the \nrequired financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual financial statements and audit reports, \nand (iii) safeguard the financial assets. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nmoderate because of the following: (i) complex financing structure with five sources of financing; \n(ii) there is scope for improving the quality of financial reporting under the ongoing project; and \n(iii) in the past, there has been delay in submitting the audited project financial statements to ADB. \nThe  main  risk  mitigation  actions  are  (i)  providing  training  in  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and \ndisbursement procedures and systems; (ii) strengthening the frequency, timeliness, and quality \nof  financial  reporting;  and  (iii)  adopting  measures  to  ensure  that  the  audited  project  financial \nstatements  are  submitted  to  ADB  on  time.  As  per  established  practice,  the  project  financial \nstatements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, following auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n27. \nProcurement. All procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB \nloan and grant will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). The additional strengthening of the Omchhu River\u2019s banks will be included in the \nongoing civil works contractor\u2019s scope as a contract amendment. The municipal infrastructure is \npart  of  the  procurement  plan  of  the  ongoing  project.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  the \nlandscaping  component  will  be  procured  separately  from  the  municipal  infrastructure  package \nbecause of their small value. \n \n28. \nThe procurement capacity assessment conducted for the ongoing project concluded that \nthe  project\u2019s  overall  procurement  risk  is  moderate.19  Procurement  specialists  supporting  the \nongoing project will continue to help the CDCL prepare and evaluate bids. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, DHI, and the CDCL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nE. \n \nPoverty.  The  erosion  and  annual  flooding  experienced  by  the  existing  municipality \n30. \ndisproportionately  affects  the  poor,  who  lack  the  resources  to  cope  and  recover  quickly.  By \naddressing this problem, the project is expected to boost the economy, create more and better \nemployment  opportunities  in  the  longer  term,  and  help  alleviate  poverty.  Moreover,  adding \nhousing  stock  to the  new  township  will  relieve  pressure  in the  existing  municipality  by making \nhousing more affordable. Therefore, the project will directly benefit vulnerable local inhabitants in \nseveral  ways.  The  second  project  output  includes  the  development  of  recreation  areas  and \npedestrian  safety  features  such  as  streetlights,  public  toilets,  road  markings,  ramps,  and \nfootpaths. The ongoing project summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been updated \nfor the additional financing.20 \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n18 ADB.  2009.

The project is categorized as having some gender elements as it will promote \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  project  consultations  and  reduce  women\u2019s  time  poverty  through \nimproved  urban  infrastructure  services,  including  water  and  sanitation.  Women  and  women\u2019s \norganizations, differently abled people, the elderly, and children will be encouraged to participate \nin  public  planning  meetings  associated  with  the  project,  especially  those  related  to  the \ndevelopment  of  municipal  infrastructure  and  the  flood  early  warning  system.  The  civil  works \ncontracts  include  labor  provisions  to  ensure that women and men receive equal  pay  for  equal \nwork, and that hygiene, HIV prevention, and COVID-19 awareness campaigns are conducted for \nlaborers  and  local  communities.  The  additional  financing  will  continue  to  aim  for  at  least  30% \nfemale participation in the community consultations and awareness campaigns, when possible. \n \nF. \n \n32. \nThe  social  and  environmental  safeguard  requirements  for  the  ongoing  project  are \nunchanged. The additional financing will cover the shortfall in the loan and grant amount resulting \nfrom cost increases to complete the components in the ongoing project. The environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  plan  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  and  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism established for the ongoing project will remain unchanged and will also be applicable \nto the additional financing. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The \nongoing project will remain category C for involuntary resettlement and for indigenous peoples. \nThe additional financing is also classified C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nin compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).21 There are no indigenous peoples \nliving in the project site and no land acquisition is envisaged for the additional financing. Social \nsafeguard measures will be achieved in line with the provisions stated in the PAM and no land \nacquisition and resettlement plan or indigenous peoples plan will be required. \n \n34. \nEnvironment. The ongoing project will remain category A for environment. The additional \nfinancing will be category C for environment as it will have no significant adverse environmental \nimpacts.  The  existing  environmental  management  plan  will  be  updated  to  include  the \nstrengthening of an additional 360 meters of the Omchhu River protection wall. Since the majority \nof additional financing funds will be used for covering cost overruns and the scope of  the river \nwall  extension  works  are  minor,  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated. \nTherefore, no changes to the ongoing project environmental impact assessment will be required. \n \n35. \nTo  date,  the  CDCL  is  satisfactorily  implementing  all  safeguards requirements,  and  any \nsafeguard implementation issues arising during implementation are being addressed effectively. \nThe CDCL submits environmental safeguard monitoring reports to ADB, and these are reviewed \nand  disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement.  The  project\u2019s  safeguard \nand  environmental  specialists  will  continue  (i)  building  the  capacity  of  the  CDCL  and  relevant \nstakeholders  in  environmental  monitoring,  (ii)  ensuring  that  the  project  is  implemented  in \naccordance with social and environmental safeguard requirements, and (iii) monitoring safeguard \ncompliance. An independent environmental monitoring expert is already engaged by the CDCL \nunder  the  ongoing  project.  The  expert  will  continue  to  monitor  project  implementation  and \ndocument  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and the government\u2019s environmental clearance. \n \n\n21 ADB.

These measures will enable DHI to offer competitive \nlease  rates.  The  project  will  also  appoint  a  reputable  firm  to  help  DHI \nattract investors and provide transaction advisory services. \nThere  are  no  plausible  mitigation  measures  to  manage  disasters \ntriggered by natural hazards that may prevent or delay implementation. \nMeasures  to  control  COVID-19  may  also  slow  down  construction \nschedules.  Nevertheless,  implementation  delays  are  not  expected, \nprimarily  because  the  works  are  routine  and  contract  packages  have \nalready been prepared.
