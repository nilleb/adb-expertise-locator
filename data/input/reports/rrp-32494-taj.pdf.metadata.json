An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nand the summary is a supplementary appendix. \n \nThe  main  thrust  of  the  Project  is  rehabilitation  of  the  selected \nirrigation  and  drainage  facilities,  which  are  in  a  critical  state  of \nfarm  production  support \ndisrepair;  provision  of  associated \nservices;  and  construction  of  rural  water  supply  in  main  cotton \nproduction regions of Khatlon  and  Sughd.  In  parallel  with  these, \nthe  Project  aims  to  accelerate  the  ongoing  agriculture  reform \nprocess by building capacity of the public sector agencies as well \nas  farmers\u2019  organizations.  The  three  irrigation  schemes  of  (i) \nKhojabakirgan  irrigation  system  (Sughd  region),  (ii)  Vakhsh \nirrigation  system  (Khatlon  region),  and  (iii)  Kyzylsu-Yakhsu \nirrigation system (Khatlon region), cover a total cultivated area of \n85,000 hectares (ha) and nearly half million people depend on the \nirrigation  water  for  their  livelihood.  The  Project  will  also  provide \nagricultural  support  services  to  the  newly-organized  privately-\nfarm  machinery  units  and \nmanaged \npromoting crop production technologies. \n \nSince  its  independence,  Tajikistan  has  been  struggling  to  reform \nits  agriculture  sector,  which  provides  livelihood  for  52%  of  the \nworkforce  through  farm  restructuring  and  trade  and  policy \nliberalization.  Due  to  the  widespread  poverty,  inefficiency  of \ntraditional farm structures, and weak fiscal capacity, the progress \nin  reform  has  been  slow.  As  a  part  of  reform  processes,  the \nGovernment  withdrew  state  financing  of  cotton  production\u2013the \ncountry\u2019s main source of foreign exchange earning\u2013in mid-1990s, \nreplacing \nloan \nadministration  and  decline  in  the  world  price  of  cotton  fiber  that \nfollowed, however, resulted in the accumulation of farm debts. \n \nNevertheless,  agriculture  remains  a  key  economic  sector  for \nTajikistan,  contributing  about  20%  of  gross  domestic  product. \nAgricultural  production  in  Tajikistan  is  crucially  dependent  on \nirrigation,  without  which  the  land  has  little  production  potential. \nThe extensive irrigation system, which was mostly built during the \nformer Soviet Union, covers about 0.8 million ha, or nearly half the \ncountry\u2019s relatively flat land. Many of the irrigation systems involve \npumping.  These  irrigation  and  associated  drainage  systems  are \nrapidly  deteriorating  due  to  inadequate  management  during  the \ncivil war and the lack of operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \nThe Government recognizes the need to expand and deepen the \nongoing  reform  process  to  restore  farmers\u2019  incentives,  improve \n\ninternational  private \n\nfinance.

At  the  same  time,  the  Government  is  keenly \naware  of  the  immediate  need  to  ensure  the  security  of  irrigation \nwater supply by rehabilitating key irrigation and drainage systems \non  a  priority  basis  and  providing  other  key  rural  infrastructure, \nparticularly rural water supply.  \n \nRehabilitating the infrastructure will result in reliable irrigation and \npotable  water  supply  and  drainage  services  that  will,  with \nagriculture  support  services,  capacity  building,  and  a  favorable \npolicy environment, increase farm yields and family incomes. This \nwill  lead  to  improved  standard  of  living  and  reduced  poverty. \nProper  O&M  arrangements  and  cost  recovery  will  ensure \nsustained benefits. \n \nThe Project\u2019s objectives are to (i)  improve living conditions of the \nfarming  communities  in  the  project  area,  and  (ii)  institute \nmeasures to sustain benefits of improvements implemented under \nthe Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $43.75  million  equivalent,  of \nwhich  $24.43  million  (56%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$19.32 million equivalent (44%) the local currency cost.

The Minister, MWRLR will be designated as project director \nwith  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation.  A  project \nmanagement office will be established to manage project activities \non  a  daily  basis,  and  to  liaise  with  ADB  and  the  coordinating \nbodies.  Three  project  implementation  units  one  in  each  project \nimplementation  and \narea,  will  be  responsible \nmaintaining  liaison  with  the  project  management  office,  local \nadministration,  and  beneficiary  organizations.  The  Agriculture \nAcademy  of  Sciences  will \nthe  crop  production \ntechnologies subcomponent through pilot demonstrations.  \n \nThe  Project  will  procure  machinery,  equipment,  civil  works, \nservices,  vehicles,  office  equipment,  and  materials.  All \nprocurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  89  person-months  of  international  and \n1,862  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  to  assist  in  areas \nfor  which  enough  technical  capacity  is  currently  not  available  in \nGovernment agencies. The consultants will assist the MWRLR in \n(i)  agriculture  support  services;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building; \n(iii)  surveys,  design,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  bid \nevaluation,  and  construction  supervision;  and \n(iv)  project \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation.  The consultants will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  the  domestic  consultants,  using  the  quality- and \ncost-based selection method. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit an irrigation service area of 85,000 \nha  and  471,500  people.  The  improvements  in  main  diversion \nworks will indirectly benefit an additional irrigation service area of \n67,500  ha  and  359,000  people.  The  average  cotton  yield  is \nexpected to increase from 1.5 to 2.4 tons/ha and wheat from 1.2 \nto  2.0  tons/ha.  The  cropping  intensity  is  expected  to  increase  by \n21%.  Annual  cotton  production  in  the  project  area  is  expected  to \nincrease  from  66,909  to  131,812  tons  and  wheat  from  42,917  to \n69,758  tons  until  year  9  and  stabilize  thereafter.  The  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  22.9%.  The  Project  is \nexpected  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  project  area \nfrom 88% to 43%. \n \nRehabilitation  of  rural  potable  water  supply  will  reduce  the \nmiseries  of  87,000  people,  particularly  women  and  children  and \nimprove  their  health  standards.

While  ADB  is  currently  assisting  the \nGovernment  to  improve  its  disaster  preparedness,  the  project \nsites were selected with particular attention to avoid undue risks of \nthese natural calamities. \n \nAccumulated  farm  debts  are  also  a  major  ris k,  affecting  farmers\u2019 \nproduction  incentives  and  the  financial  sustainability  of  many \ncotton  farms.  The  Government  is  committed  to  resolving  the \nissues,  and  will  create  a  high-level  task  force to develop  a  debt \nresolution  strategy  and  identify  other  relevant  policy/legislative \nactions.  The  Project  provides  associated  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) to assist the task force.  \n \nThe  possibility  of  renewed  civil  conflict  is  receding  as  the  peace \naccord  is  sustained.  The  risks  of  implementation  delays  arising \nfrom  unfamiliarity  of  the  MWRLR  with  ADB  procedure  has  been \npartly  mitigated  by \ninvolving  MWRLR  staff  during  project \nprocessing.  MWRLR  staff\u2019s  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  procedures  will \nbe  enhanced  during  the  implementation  period.  The  issues  of \ndelays  in  the  farm reorganization process, old farm management \npractices  and  administrative  controls  over  production,  and \nmarketing barriers are being addressed under the policy reforms. \n \nSustainability  of  benefits  will  be  threatened  if  proper  O&M \narrangements are not in place or the beneficiaries fail to meet the \nO&M costs. These aspects have been addressed and appropriate \nassurances have been obtained from the Government. \n \nA  grant  of  $960,000  equivalent  financed  by  the  Japan  Special \nFund funded by the Government of Japan will provide services of \n27  person-months  of  international  and  54  person-months  of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i) \nresolving  accumulated \n(ii)  promoting, \nimplementing,  and  monitoring  the  policy  reforms,  particularly  in \nagriculture marketing and water resources management. The TA \nwill also assist the  Government in establishing unique grades for \nTajikistan  cotton  that  are  recognized  in  the  international  markets \nand  launch  an  information  campaign  for  the  farmers.  ADB  will \nengage  consultants  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants using quality- and cost-based selection method. \n\nfarm  debts;  and \n\n\fvii\n\n'...\n\n~\n\n~\n\n-;;:\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project. The report also describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Farm  Debt  Resolution  and  Policy  Reforms,  and  if  the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved a TA1 to prepare an agriculture rehabilitation project. The project preparatory TA was \ncarried  out  from  February  to  July  2001  and  built  upon  the  previously  completed  Agriculture \nSector Assessment Study.2 This document is based on the consultants\u2019 reports, the findings of \nthe  missions,  and  discussions  with  national  and  local  government  agencies,  potential  project \nbeneficiaries, and nongovernmental organizations, particularly those held during the roundtable \ndiscussions in Dushanbe on 8 and 9 October 2002. Project framework is in Appendixes 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nTajikistan has a population of 6.1 million with a growth rate of 1.7% per annum and an \n3. \naverage  life  expectancy  of  64.  About  73%  of  the  population  live  in  rural  areas  and  18%  of \nhouseholds have a female as head of the family. As a result of the termination of fiscal transfers \nand sharp decline in agricultural productivity, rural incomes have plunged over the past decade. \nThe  agriculture  sector  is  estimated  to  employ  52%  of  the  workforce  but  unemployment  and \nunderemployment levels are high. On average, at least 30% of rural households have no paid \nemployment. Salaries are paid in kind, either inputs (used on  household plots) or food, usually \nwheat.  Most  rural  families  rely  heavily  on  their  household  land  plots  of  about  0.1  ha,  which \ntypically  account  for  more  than  half  of  total  income.  Consequently,  these  plots  have  become \nefficient  integrated  food  production  systems  contributing  about  40%  of  total  agricultural \nproduction. \n \nAs  the  rural  economy  collapsed,  the  provision  of  social  services  also  went  into  steep \n4. \ndecline.  The  former  state  and  collective  farms,  which  had  been  responsible  for  supporting \nprimary  education  and  health  services  as  well  as  rural  water  supplies,  were  no  longer  able  to \nfund  them.  The  incidence  of  many  serious  diseases,  such  as  tuberculosis,  typhoid,  and \nintestinal infections, has increased substantially. A similar situation prevails in education . Also, \nmost water supply systems are defunct and many rural communities depend on surface water \nfor their domestic needs with the inevitable risk of infection. Less than 2% of the households are \nconnected to sewerage systems. \n \n5. \nAgainst this background it is inevitable that poverty is widespread; nationally, 83% of the \npopulation had spending below the poverty threshold of TJS20/month. Poverty levels in the rural \nareas are even higher, rising to 89% in Khatlon region. The principal cause of poverty is the lack \nof job opportunities or very low salaries arising from the low productivity of irrigated agriculture. \nIn  2000,  productivity  levels  plunged  to  less  that  half  of  those  of  1990.  The  Government  has \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Agriculture Rehabilitation Project. Manila. \n2   ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Agriculture Sector Assessment Project. Manila \n\n\f2 \n\nrecognized this correlation in  its  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy3  and  has  made  improvement  of \nagriculture sector performance the core of its strategy. \n \n6. \nTajikistan  remains  a  predominantly  agricultural  economy.  The  sector  contributes  about \n20%  of  gross  domestic  product,  30%  of  export  revenues  (mostly  cotton),  and  35%  of  tax \nrevenues.  It  also  provides  the  major  source  of  employment.  Almost  80%  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  arable \narea is irrigated. Consequently, issues relating to the irrigation have a very significant impact on \nagriculture and  on  the  economy  as  a  whole.  Given  the  Tajikistan  agro-climatic conditions, the \nGovernment and the farmers consider cotton as the most important cash crop. Its profitability in \nthe recent past has, however, been reduced mainly because of (i) low productivity resulting from \ndysfunctional  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  and  inappropriate  use  of  crop  inputs,  and  (ii) \ndecline in international prices. Local consumption of the cotton is only 30%, mainly in the textile \nand garment industry. Currently, there is little interest in developing the downstream industry to \nincrease domestic consumption. \n \n7. \nSince  independence,  the  Government  has  initiated  a  range  of  reforms  intended  to \ntransform the agriculture sector into a competitive market-led economy. The state procurement \nsystem  for  agricultural  commodities  was  dismantled  together  with  direct  administrative \ninterventions  in  input  and  output  markets.  Price  controls  were  removed  and  trade  barriers \nrelaxed. Land reform is ongoing within a framework, that allows private farms to operate based \non  lifelong  inheritable  leases.  Payment  for  irrigation  water  delivery  has  been  introduced  and \nefforts  are  being  made  toward  the  full  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of \nirrigation  systems.  The  implementation  of  these  reforms  has,  however,  not  been  satisfactory \nparticularly because of interventions by local administrations.  \n \n8. \nThe reforms have brought only modest gains compared to the scale of the losses to the \neconomy  since  independence.  The  current  cultivated  area  (irrigated  and  rainfed)  is  around \n710,000  hectares  (ha),  which  is  a  reduction  of  about  17%  over  the  past  decade.  Farms  have \naccumulated  debts  over  the  last  6  years  mainly  because  of  (i)  low  productivity  of  the  sector, \nparticularly  of  cotton  because  of  deterioration  of  irrigation  and  drainage  facilities,  absence  of \nrural  support  services,  and  inappropriate  use  of  credit;  and  (ii)  low  prices  of  cotton  in  the \ninternational market. Cotton yields across the country average 1.4 tons (t)/ha compared to 2.8 \nt/ha before independence. Cereal yields are also low, averaging 1.3 t/ha in 2000 compared to \n1990  yield  of  1.4  t/ha.  These  shifts  have  resulted  in  marked  changes  in  output.  In  2000, \nTajikistan produced only 335,000 t cotton compared to over 800,000 t in 1990. These declines \nin sector performance are connected with wider key problems described in next section. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n9. \nLand  Reform  and  Farm  Reorganization.  Land  remains  state  owned.  Families  either \nindividually or collectively are given land-use rights, which can be passed on through inheritance \nbut  are  not  tradable.  These  limitations  restrict  the  evolution  of  commercial  agriculture.  Further \nsteps are needed to broaden and deepen land-use rights. The lack  of clear procedures under \nthe existing Law on Dehkan Farms4 adopted in 1992 for land allocation to private farmers and \nfor dispute settlement has resulted in the decisions of local authorities being viewed as arbitrary, \nsometimes  involving  unfair  elements.  To  remove  these  flaws,  the  Parliament  amended  the \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2002. Poverty Reduction Strategy for the Republic of Tajikistan. Manila. The Poverty Reduction Strategy was \napproved  by  the  Parliament  in  June  20002  and  signing  of  the  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  between  the \nGovernment and ADB is scheduled in December 2002. \n\n4   A dehkan farm is individually or collectively privately-managed farm. \n\n\f3 \n\nabove law in 2002. Most of the land reform issues are being addressed by ongoing World Bank \nProjects and bilateral agencies (Appendix2). \n \n10. \nAgricultural  Marketing  and  Farm  Debts.  By  the  end  of  1996,  Tajikistan  had  officially \nabolished  production  targets  and  administered  pricing  for  all  agricultural  commodities.  These \nreforms  were  followed  by  the  privatization  of  all  23  state-owned  cotton  ginneries  after \ndismantling  of  barriers  to  private  sector  entry  into  the  cotton  ginning  and  wheat  flour  milling \nindustries. Since 1997, cotton has suffered from a nearly 30% fall in world cotton prices. This fall \nhas exacerbated the task of repaying commercial loans that were provided by Agroinvest Bank \nused to fund cotton production and were guaranteed by the Government. The total commercial \ndebt  of  the  industry  including  working  capital  is  about  $120  million  spread  across  most  of  the \nlarger farms. The major effort launched to clear this debt includes requiring the farms with debt \nto  plant  70%  of  their  land  to  cotton  (through  so  called  \u201ccotton  balances\u201d),  and  to  enter  into \nforward  purchasing  contracts  with  the  creditors  (called  investors,  generally  one  specified  by \nlocal  administration  for  each  district)  who  are  providing  inputs  (fertilizer  and  fuel)  at  above-\nmarket  prices.  Farms  without  debt  are  also  under  pressure  by  local  administrations  to  grow \ncotton, but are free to sell their product to local textile factories. The export of raw cotton is not \npermitted and export of cotton fiber is, effectively, a monopoly. This situation is placing a heavy \nburden on rural communities in general and particularly upon the managers and employees of \nindebted farms. Details on cotton sector issues are in Appendix 3. \n \n11. \nBased  on  policy  discussions  during  loan  processing,  the  Government  issued  two \nPresidential decrees in September 2002 that exempted the 2002 cotton crop from value added \ntax and abolished cotton balances. This has reduced regional and district administrations\u2019 roles \nin making decisions regarding cotton production, terminated the monopoly of Agroinvest Bank, \nand given farmers a free choice on investors thus facilitating competition among investors. Also, \naccording to an earlier resolution, the farmers can now trade raw cotton. With the policy reforms \nagreed with the external funding agencies, particularly the World Bank, and those implemented \nrecently,  the  policy  environment  is  conducive  to  improvements  in  agriculture  sector  through \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  capacity  building  interventions.  However  effective  coordination \nis needed among funding agencies to monitor the implementation of the reforms. \n \nfarms \n12. \nreorganization, and promote farm investment opportunities. In this context, on the request of the \nGovernment,  ADB  organized  a  meeting  in  Dushanbe  during  8\u20139  October  2002.  The  meeting \nprovided  an  opportunity  for  open  and  frank  discussion  among  all  stakeholders.  The  main \ndiscussion  related  to  (i)  unfair  and  one-sided  contracts  offered  by  investors  and  the  need  to \ndelink  investment  from  input  of  supplies  and  marketing  of  the  outputs;  (ii)  write-off  or \nrescheduling  of  debt  to  Government  agencies;  (iii)  establishment  of  a  task  force  to study the \ndebt issues, develop debt resolution strategy, and monitor implementation of policy reforms; (iv) \nneed  for  agricultural  credit  from  other  sources  to  provide  healthy  competition  with  existing \ninvestors; and (v) urgent need to rehabilitate irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The meeting \nparticipants  also  recommended  to  the  Government  to  facilitate  implementation  of  existing \nresolutions  asking  the  investors  to  allow  the  farmers  to  transfer  production  advances  to  bank \naccounts  reserved  for  use  of  production  inputs,  and  allow  trading  of  raw  cotton.  Also,  the \nGovernment was requested to standardize the contracts for the 2003 year production and run \nan  information  awareness  campaign.  ADB  was  requested  to  finance  the  (i)  information \ncampaign,  (ii)  establishment  of  unique  grades  for  Tajikistan  cotton  that  are  recognized  in  the \ninternational markets, and (iii) the task force. \n \n\nfarm  debts,  accelerate \n\nThe  Government \n\nis  committed \n\nto  resolve \n\nthe \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n13.  Water  Management  Issues.  Agricultural  production  in  Tajikistan  dependents  cruically \non irrigation, without which  the land has little production potential. Extensive irrigation systems, \nmostly built during the time of the former Soviet Union, cover nearly half the country\u2019s relatively \nflat  land.  The  irrigation  and  associated  drainage  systems  are  rapidly  deteriorating  due to  poor \nmanagement during the civil war and the lack of  O&M.  About  a  third  of  the  irrigated  area  use \npumps to lift water from a few meters to over 300 m involving a cascade of pumping stations. \nAbout 75,000 ha of command area require water to be pumped at least 150 m. However, only \n60%  of  pumping  capacity  is  operational  with  a  corresponding  decline  in  irrigation  volumes.  A \nsimilar situation applies to the drainage systems; their neglect is leading to higher groundwater \nlevels, water logging, and salinization. According to the agreement among the countries of the \nAral Sea basin, enough water is allocated to serve Tajikistan\u2019s irrigation systems. However, the \nwater is not being adequately used because of dysfunctional irrigation systems and poor water \nmanagement. Improving the performance of irrigated agriculture requires rehabilitating irrigation \nand drainage systems and more efficient water management. \n \n14. \nThe rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems is inextricably linked to the issue of \ncost recovery and the maintenance of such relatively expensive systems. Water charges were \nintroduced in 1996 and collection rates average less than 40% of billed amounts, but even if the \ncharges were fully introduced and collected, they would cover only about 10% of maintenance \ncosts,  excluding  energy  costs.  In  addition,  water  charges  do  not  differentiate  between  gravity \nand pump irrigation systems. The structure of irrigation water charges need to be rationalized to \nreflect differences in system costs; the basic water delivery fee should be increased to at least \nmaintain its real value and collection rates must be improved substantially. The Government is \ncommitted  under  an  ongoing  World  Bank  project5  to  gradually  increase  recovery  rates  of  the \nwater  delivery  cost  over  10  years  and  to  provide  funds  to  make  up  the  shortfall  during  the \ntransition period. \n \n15. \nThe  recently-approved  Water  Code  provides  a  basis  for  the  formation  of  water  users\u2019 \nassociations (WUAs) that will be responsible for O&M of the tertiary systems and contribute to \nthe  cost  of  maintaining  the  secondary  and  primary  systems  through  water  charges  payable  to \nthe local water agencies. This calls for an increased sense of partnership between WUAs and \nwater  management  agencies.  The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land  Reclamation \n(MWRLR) needs assistance to review its institutional capacity and structure in order to meet the \nimpending requirements. \n \n16. \nAgriculture  Support  Services.  Many  newly-organized  dehkan  farms  with  limited \nfarming knowledge would benefit from a program of farm demonstrations designed to illustrate \nthe  technologies  that  could  dramatically  increase  their  productivity.  Farmers  using  relatively \nexpensive  irrigation  water  need  to  learn  how  to  (i)  improve  crop  yields, (ii) intensify their crop \nrotations,  and  (iii)  diversify  their  cropping  to  achieve  higher  revenues.  Three  areas  of  support \nhave been identified: (i) farm demonstration activities related to soil fertility and crop husbandry, \n(ii)  increasing  the  availability  of  improved  seeds,  and  (iii)  provision  of  farm  machinery.  The \nprivate  sector  need  to  be  shown  the  viability  of  the  farm  machinery  rental  business  by \nestablishing farm machinery units (FMUs) and running them on commercial basis. \n \n17. \nRural  Potable  Water  Supply.  Nationally,  there  are  over  600  water  supply  networks, \nwhich originally provided 60% of the population with piped water. As a result of damage during \nthe civil conflict and lack of maintenance, most rural potable water networks have deteriorated, \n\n                                                 \n5   World  Bank.  2000.

Washington DC. \n\n\f5 \n\ndepriving many rural communities of safe drinking water. Survey results indicate that irrigation \ncanals  and  pipelines  are  the  main  sources  of  drinking  water  in  the  project  area.  Excluding \ndistrict centers, the proportion of households with access to piped water is less than 20%. Even \nwhere a pipe network exists, many are in a state of disrepair forcing households to collect water \nfrom  as  far  away  as  10  kilometers.  The  increased  dependency  on  surface  water  sources  has \nresulted  in  a  much  higher  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  in  rural  areas.  All  of  the  targeted \ndistricts have incidence rates of typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, and malaria ranging from 130% to \n230%  of  the  national  average.  These  districts  are  the  poor  communities  that  have  the  least \naccess to drinking water and are most susceptible to waterborne diseases. \n \n18. \nGovernment  Plans  and  ADB  Interim  Operational  Strategy.  The  Government,  as  a \npart  of  its  rural  development  strategy,6  is  committed  to  (i)  continuing  the  farm  reorganization \nprogram, (ii) improving the efficiency of irrigation water use, (iii) developing a rural credit system, \n(iv) rehabilitating key irrigation facilities, and (v) implementing a poverty reduction program with \na substantial agriculture sector component. The ADB interim operational strategy for Tajikistan \nwas approved in 1998, before the adoption of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and thus did not \nhave  an  explicit  poverty  focus.  The  objectives  of  the  interim  operational  strategy  are  to  (i) \nfacilitate  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy,  (ii)  assist  postconflict  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction, and (iii) support natural disaster rehabilitation. Three priority sectors have been \nidentified: agriculture, infrastructure, and the social sector. \n \n19. \nAgriculture  Sector  Assistance  and  Lessons  Learned.  Lending  to  the  agriculture \nsector did not commence in any significant amount until 1999 when the World Bank approved \nits Farm Privatization Support Project. This project is helping to shape the farm reorganization \nprograms  of  10  former  state  farms  and  to  formulate  policies  and  procedures  that  could  be \napplied  to  the  country  as  a  whole.  In  2000,  the  World  Bank  approved  the  Rural  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  Project,  which  will  be  implemented  in  the  same  locations  as  the  Farm \nPrivatization  Support  Project  as  the  World  Bank  found  that  defective  irrigation  facilities  are  a \nsignificant constraint to farm reorganization. Other significant funding sources are the Aga Khan \nFoundation, European Union, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  and  World  Food  Program.  Given  the \ncircumstances in Tajikistan since 1994, most assistance has been relatively quick disbursing for \npriority  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  emergencies,  and  structural  adjustment.  ADB  has \napproved two emergency loans relating to agriculture. ADB\u2019s Emergency Restoration of Yavan \nWater Conveyance System Project is ADB\u2019s ongoing emergency assistance being executed by \nMWRLR. The current status  of  its  implementation  is  satisfactory.  Useful  experience  has  been \ngained  in  administering  the  Yavan  project,  particularly  with  respect  to  institutional  and  human \nresources  capacity;  and  design,  implementation,  and  O&M  practices.  Appendix  2  provides \ninformation on major external assistance related to agriculture. The proposed Project will be the \nfirst ADB loan to Tajikistan\u2019s agriculture sector and incorporates lessons learned from the ADB \ncountry program and the World Bank projects in the same sector. \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Government of Tajikistan. 2000.

The Project\u2019s target is to reduce poverty in the project area from \n88% to 43%. The project objectives will be achieved through (i) enhanced crop yields brought \nabout  by  improved  irrigation  supplies  and  drainage  as  a  result  of  infrastructure improvements; \n(ii)  access  to  improved  potable  water,  which  will  reduce  efforts  in  fetching  water  and  improve \nhealth  standards;  (iii)  building  of  the  capacity  of  the  water  resources  institutions,  and \norganization and training of WUAs and water and sanitation councils (WSCs); and (iv) transfer \nof  management  of  the  irrigation,  drainage,  and  potable  water  supply  systems  to  the \nbeneficiaries  after  they  are  adequately  trained  to  manage  them.  Achievement  of  these \nobjectives  will  be  monitored  and  sustainability  ensured  by  transfer  of  management  of  the \nimproved systems to the beneficiaries.  Infrastructure  rehabilitation  will  result  in  improved  and \nreliable irrigation and potable water supply and drainage services which, with agriculture support \nservices  and  capacity  building  and  a  under  favorable  policy  environment,  will  increase  farm \nyields  and  family  incomes.  This  will  lead  to  improved  standard  of  living  and  reduced  poverty. \nProper O&M arrangements and cost recovery will ensure sustained benefits. \n \n21. \nThe  proposed  project  area  comprises  three  major  irrigation  systems;  (i)  Khojabakirgan \nirrigation  system  in  Sughd  region,  (ii)  Vakhsh  irrigation  system  in  the  Kurgan-Tyube  area  of \nKhatlon region, and (iii) Kyzylsu-Yakhsu irrigation system in Kulyab area of Khatlon region. The \nselection of the project systems was based on critical need for immediate intervention, potential \nfor  development,  economic  returns,  and  regional  balance.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  an \nirrigation  service  area  of  85,000  ha  and  471,500  people.  The  improvement  in  main  diversion \nworks  will  indirectly  benefit  an  additional  irrigation  service  area  of  67,500  ha  and  additional \n359,000 people. Project locations are shown on the Map. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  has  the  following  components:  (i)  agriculture  support  services  for  dehkan \n22. \nfarms; (ii) rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems and related institutional support; (iii) \nimprovement  of  potable  water  supply  systems;  and  (iv)  project  management,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. The proposed interventions are being pilot-tested under the ongoing Tajikistan Rural \nPoverty  Reduction  Project  financed  by  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.7  The  experience \ngained  will  be  reviewed  and  evaluated  before  large-scale  replication  under  the  proposed \nProject. A  detailed  description  of  project  components  is  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A \nwhile a brief description of the components follows. \n \n\n1. \n\nAgriculture Support Services for Dehkan Farms \n\n23. \nThis  component  is  primarily  for  newly-organized  dehkan  farms  and  was  developed  on \nfarmers\u2019  demand  analysis.  It  consists  of  the  following  three  programs:  (i)  farm  demonstrations \non soil fertility and crop husbandry, (ii) promotion of improved seeds, and (iii) establishment of \nthree  FMUs.  Each  program  will  be  tailored  to  the  specific  needs  of  that  system  and  will  be \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2001.

The farming entities involved should \nalso be largely free of debt in order to have the flexibility to promote or implement the program.  \n \n24.  Within  each  pilot  area,  the  demonstration  subprogram  will  undertake  a  set  of  activities \ndesigned  to  illustrate  the  benefits  of  (i)  soil  fertility  improvement  treatments;  and  (ii)  improved, \nintensified, and diversified cropping technologies. Soil surveys will determine the characteristics \nof  each  pilot  area\u2019s  soils,  and  the  treatments  required.  Treatments  may  include  land  leveling, \nleaching, green manure, and drainage according to whether soils are uneven, saline, sandy, or \nwaterlogged.  The  demonstration  plots  will  promote  appropriate  crop  production  technologies \nincluding the use of improved seeds, fertilizers, integrated pest management,8 and other cultural \npractices.  This  subprogram  will  be  implemented  by  local  research  institutes  of  the  Agricultural \nAcademy  of  Sciences  supported  by  the  international  research  institutes.  The  staff  of  the  local \ninstitutions  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MOA)  will  be  closely  associated  in  these  activities, \nwhich will build their capacity to continue the activities after project completion. \n \nThe  seed  subprogram  will  help  farmers  acquire  certified  seeds.  The  local  research \n25. \ninstitutes will multiply small quantities of selected varieties, clean and calibrate the seeds, and \nsell  them  to  farms  in  the  rehabilitated  irrigation  systems.  The  technologies  to  be  introduced \ncould be funded out of the farmers\u2019 personal resources or the existing credit channels. \n \n26. \nThe Project will, through subsidiary loan agreements, provide $1.0 million to each of the \nthree  FMUs,  one  in  each  project  system,  to  finance  their  establishment  and  the  required \nmachinery,  civil  works,  workshop  facilities  for  maintenance  and  repair,  office  equipment,  and \ntraining.  Madad9 shall provide technical support: (i) to the project management office (PMO) for \nselection  and  procurement  of  farm  machinery;  (ii)  in  establishing  FMUs;  and  (iii) to the FMUs, \nonce they are established, in setting up their procedures on operation, repair, and maintenance \nof the farm machinery. The FMUs will be established initially as state-owned commercial entities \nusing facilities and staff of selected existing  FMUs. The local technicians will be trained by the \nsuppliers  in  repair  and  maintenance  of  the  procured  farm  machinery.  Their  equity  stakes  will, \nhowever, be gradually offered to the public and by project completion, their majority stakes will \nbe sold to the private sector through regional and central branches of Tajik Universal Goods and \nRaw  Materials  Exchange  by  project  completion  date.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange  risk  and  will  charge  interest  rate  to  cover  the  administrative  charges  and  foreign \nexchange  risk.  The  FMUs  will  provide  farm  machinery  services  to  dehkan  farms  and  collect \nservice charges determined on a commercial basis. Details are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n2. \n\nRehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems and Institutional Support \n\n27. \nThe Project will finance rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage facilities of three systems \ncovering about 85,000 ha, provide for capacity building so MWRLR can meet the demands of its \nchanged  role  as  service  provider,  and  organize  and  train  an  estimated  30  WUAs.  During \nimplementation,  pumped  irrigation  areas  will  be  scrutinized  to  exclude  those  which  are \n\n                                                 \n8  \n\nIntegrated  pest  management  is  a  pest  control  approach  that  uses  regular  monitoring  to  determine if and when \ntreatments are needed and employs physical, mechanical, cultural, biological, and educational tactics to keep pest \nnumbers  low  enough  to  prevent  intolerable  damage  or  annoyance.  Least-toxic chemicals are used as the last \nresort. \n\n9   Madad is a state-owned commercial enterprise that has 52 joint stock companies operating FMUs in each district. \nMadad has previously facilitated establishment of some FMUs that were privatized few years later. Its operations \nare,  however,  constrained  due  to  old  and  inadequate  machinery  and  workshop  equipment,  and  poor  financial \nresources. \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\neconomically  and  financially  not  viable.

The system was designed as a pump \n29. \nirrigation  system.  However,  the  initial  construction  did  not  lead  to  full  development  of  the \nrequired  irrigation  and  drainage  system.  The  following  works  are  proposed:  (i)  at  Kairakum \nReservoir, provision of a pontoon including installation of 8 link pipes and replacement of pumps \nat  two  pump  stations;  (ii)  replacement  of  8,720  meter  (m)  of  pressure  pipelines;  (iii)  protection \nworks to safeguard the  siphon on the canal; (iv) replacement of cross regulator gates (20); (v) \ndesilting of collector drain reaches; (vi) desilting of inter-farm canal reaches; (vii) rehabilitation of \ncanal  linings;  (viii)  rehabilitation/replacement  of  drainage  pumps  and  other  facilities;  and  (ix) \nrehabilitation,  repair,  and  extension  of  downstream  transitions  for  selected  critical  canals  and \ndrainage structures. \n \n30. \nVakhsh  Irrigation  and  Drainage  System.  The  key  structures  of  the  system  are  in \nimminent danger of collapse, which would leave large areas without water supply. To arrest the \nsituation, the Project will (i) repair canal head works and cross regulator structures of the main \ncanals;  (ii)  replace  20  interfarm  canal  off-take  structures;  (iii)  rehabilitate  and  repair  the \nembankment of part of the Ak-Gaza canal including field investigation to control seepage losses \nthrough embankment; (iv) rehabilitate canal linings on 18 canals; (v) desilt critical reaches of 25 \ninterfarm  canals;  (vi)  desilt  selected  reaches  of  30  collector  drains;  (vii)  rehabilitate/replace \ndrainage  pumps  and  other  facilities;  and  (viii)  rehabilitate,  repair,  and  extend  embankment \nprotections and downstream transitions for approximately 80 canals and drainage structures. \n \n31. \nKyzylsu-Yakhsu  Irrigation  and  Drainage  System.  The  proposed  rehabilitation  works \nwill include (i) diversion structures on the Kyzylsu River and related main canal head works, (ii) \ncross  regulators  and  off-take  structures,  (iii)  repair  of  canal  linings  on  selected  reaches of 17 \ncanals,  (iv)  replacement  of  10  turbine  pumps,  (v)  desilting  of  critical  reaches  of  25  interfarm \ncanals, (vi) desilting of critical reaches of 16 collector drains, (vii) relocation of a drainage culvert \nin railway embankment, (viii) rehabilitation  and  repair  of  the  Selbur  reservoir  embankment  to \ncontrol seepage, and (ix) rehabilitation and replacement of drainage pumps and other facilities. \n \n\nb. \n\nSupport to Water Resources Management Agencies \n\n32.  MWRLR,  with  its  region-  and  district-level  organizations,  is  the  agency  with  overall \nresponsibility  for  the  water  sector.  In  addition,  MWRLR  incorporates  Selkhozvodoprovodstroy, \nthe agency responsible for constructing rural potable water supply networks and for the O&M of \nthese networks. The Project will  assist these agencies\u2019 transition to a market-orientated culture \nby  providing  training  in  the  planning  and  allocation  of  water  resources  based  on  meeting \nfinancial  and  environmental  criteria,  including  cost  recovery  mechanisms.  The  activities  will \ninclude help in redefining and realigning roles and responsibilities and in introducing procedures \nfor better O&M and sustainability of project benefits. The Project will formulate a comprehensive \nlong-term  program  for  development  and  support  of  WUAs,  including  (i)  identification  of \nbudgetary  allocations  needed  for  WUA  support  units  at  the  ministerial,  regional,  and  district \nlevels;  and  (ii)  determination  of  an  overall  training  program  for  their  staff.  The  Project  will  also \nprovide O&M, communications, and office equipment; and irrigation management software. \n\n\f9 \n\nc. \n\nOrganization and Training of Water Users\u2019 Associations \n\n33. \nTo  empower  the  beneficiaries,  particularly  the  poorer  factions,  and  facilitate  sustained \nproject  benefits,  the  Project  will  support  promotion,  formation,  and  training  of  WUAs  in  the \nproject area. Priority will be given to parts of the systems that have been privatized and where \ngroups  of  farmers  depend  on  a  common  source  of  water.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  (i)  a \ndialogue  is  established  between  the  target  communities  and  concerned  sector  agencies  with \nrespect to organization of WUAs, (ii) WUAs are organized in a participatory process, and (iii) the \nlevel  and  role  of  female  participation  are  promoted  in  formulation,  organization,  and \nmanagement of WUAs. \n \nInitially,  the  WUAs  would  take  over  management  of  the  tertiary  systems.  As  they  gain \n34. \nexperience, responsibility of the secondary system will also be delegated to them and by project \ncompletion, they are expected to be handling O&M of  all irrigation and drainage facilities of the \nProject.  The  WUAs  will  be  supported  in  (i)  governance  and  administration,  (ii)  financial \nmanagement, (iii) collection of water fees, and (iv) integrated water management. \n \n\n3. \n\nImprovement of Potable Water Supply Systems \n\nThe  Project  will  support  reconstruction  of  potable  water  supply  systems  in  selected \n35. \ncommunities within the designated irrigation systems\u2019 command areas to serve a total of 87,000 \nbeneficiaries who currently do not get water from a  safe source. The selection of villages was \nundertaken during a series of stakeholder workshops using a set of criteria including (i) absence \nof a safe water source, (ii) a high incidence of waterborne diseases, (iii) community willingness \nto  participate,  and  (iv)  affordability.  Depending  on  the  status  of  the  existing  facilities  and \nbeneficiaries\u2019 institutional capacity to maintain them, the Project has proposed simple, least-cost \nworks for reconstructing potable water supply systems.  \n \n36. \nThe  proposed  works  include  (i)  two  boreholes,  one  reservoir,  a  pipeline  network,  100 \nstandpipes, and power supply and pumps to serve 11,000 people in Kistakuz village in Gafurov \ndistrict;  (ii)  six  boreholes,  one  reservoir,  pipeline  network,  134  standpipes,  and  power supply \nand pumps to serve 13,500 people in Gulkhandoz Jamoat10 in Jabbar Rasulov district; (iii) 225 \nboreholes  45  m  deep  and  handpumps  in  selected  communities  of  Vakhsh  district  to  serve \n22,500  people,  and  (iv)  13  boreholes,  one  reservoir,  a  pipeline  network,  400  standpipes  and \npower supply and pumps to serve 40,000 people in Khulbuk, Mahamadaliev, and Yap farms in \nVose  district.  The  project  will  also  facilitate  education,  training,  and  social  marketing  of  health \nbenefits of improved standards of sanitation provision. \n \n37. \nThe project will support transformation of the water distribution networks into community-\nmanaged systems. The project will establish a central support unit within PMO. At the field level, \nexperienced  nongovernmental  organizations11  will  organize  and  support  the  WSCs.  The \ninfrastructure  of  the  village  water  networks  will  remain  in  public  ownership  but  their  operation \nand management will be transferred to the WSCs. \n \n\n                                                 \n10   A jamoat is the smallest unit of public administration. \n11   Aga  Khan  Foundation  and  Cooperative  for  American  Relief  Everywhere  (CARE)  International,  two  international \n\nnongovernmental organizations, have experience organizing similar beneficiary organizations in Tajikistan. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n4. \n\nProject Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  establish  and  provide  support  to  a  PMO  in  MWRLR,  Dushanbe  and \nthree  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  one  in  each  project  area.  Additional  support  will  be \nprovided by consultants, who will train and advise PMO staff. The organizational arrangements \nof the PMO and PIUs are discussed in implementation arrangements (paras. 45-47). \n \n39. \nA monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit will be established within the PMO to implement \nthe  environmental  monitoring  system  recommended  in  the  Summary  Initial  Environmental \nExamination (Supplementary Appendix  C) and to monitor the environmental and social impacts \nof  the  Project.  Specifically,  the  M&E  unit  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  collecting,  collating,  and \nanalyzing  baseline  data  relating  to  the  economic,  social,  environmental,  and  health  conditions \nwithin the project area; (ii) benefit monitoring during project implementation, and (iii) evaluating \nthe project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts within the selected systems. The unit \nwill particularly monitor (i) income opportunities and other resources provided under the Project \nto  extremely  poor  communities  and  women,  (ii)  reduction  in  vulnerability  of  households  to \nwaterborne diseases, and (iii) participation of women in community activities. The M&E unit will \nhave  two  staff  members,  who  will  work  with  the  responsible  agencies.  For  environmental \nmonitoring,  they  will  collect  and  analyze  data  relating  to  the  quality  of  irrigation  and  drainage \nwater,  soil  chemistry,  and  groundwater  depth  and  quality.  District-level  laboratories  will  be \nequipped  to  ensure  effective  and  regular  monitoring.  Environmental  monitoring  will  provide  a \ncomparison of the before and after project situations and a limited comparison between project \nand  nonproject  areas.  The  project  performance,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on its project performance management system. \n \n40. \nTo monitor the project\u2019s social impact, during the first year of project implementation the \nM&E  unit  will  compile  a  benchmark  database  on  basic  economic  and  social  conditions  to \nprovide  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  beneficiary  communities.  Key  indicators  will  be  tracked \nduring  project  implementation  and  a  comparison  made  between  the  benchmark  and  project \ncompletion situations. The database will be analyzed to provide an assessment of the Project\u2019s \nimpact on different social groups, including women and the lower income households.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  Project  will  help  the  extremely  poor  people  living  in  the  project  area  through  the \n\n41. \nfood-for-work scheme (para. 46). \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n42. \nThe Project is estimated to cost $43.75 million equivalent, of which $24.43 million (56%) \nis  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $19.32  million  equivalent  (44%)  the  local  currency  cost.  The \ncost  estimates  include  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  include  taxes  and  duties \namounting to $5.82 million (Table 1).

The terms of relending will not be softer than those of the project loan.  \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n44. \nThe proposed ADB loan of Special Drawing Rights 26,482,000 ($35.0 million equivalent) \nwill finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $24.43 million and $10.57 million equivalent of \nthe  local  currency  cost,  or  80%  of  the  total  project  cost  (Table  2).  The  provision  of  local  cost \nfinancing  is  justified  on  country  and  project  considerations.  The  beneficiaries  will  contribute, \ninkind, the equivalent of $1.75 million (4% of total costs) toward costs of on-farm improvements \nlinked with project interventions,  Including land leveling, rehabilitation of canal turnouts and on-\nfarm  drainage  facilities,  and  construction  of  additional  on-farm  watercourse  structures,  and \nadditional cost of better and more inputs during the implementation period. The Government will \nmeet  the  remaining  local  currency  costs  of  $7.0  million  equivalent,  or  16%  of  the  total  project \ncost.  The  borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan.  The  Government  will  make  the  loan \nproceeds,  other  than  those  for  FMUs,  available  to  the  Executing  Agency  through  budgetary \nappropriations. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and will have a \nterm of 32 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per year during the grace period of eight years \nand 1.5% per year thereafter.

A  high-level  project  steering  committee  established  during  project  preparation  will \ncontinue  to  function  during  project  implementation  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  facilitate \ninterministerial coordination at the central level. A Working Group, also established to facilitate \noperational coordination of activities involving more than one ministry will continue to work. The \nminister  of  MWRLR  will  be  designated  as  project  director  with  overall  responsibility  for  project \nimplementation.  A  PMO  will  be  established  within  MWRLR  to  manage  project  activities  on  a \ndaily basis, and to liaise with ADB and the coordinating bodies. Three PIUs, one in each project \narea,  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation  activities  in  their  areas,  and  maintaining \nliaison  with  the  PMO,  local  administration,  and  beneficiary  organizations.  The  Agriculture \nAcademy  of  Sciences  will  implement  farm  demonstrations  on  soil  fertility  and  crop  husbandry \nand  promote  improved  seeds.  The  working  group  shall  facilitate  operational  coordination  of \ninterministerial activities at the district level and provide assistance to the PIUs. The PMO will be \nled  by  a  full-time  project  manager  and  the  PIUs  by  deputy  project  managers.  The  project \nmanager has been nominated by the Government. The deputy project managers and other  key \nstaff  will  be  selected  on  open  merit  by  a  panel  of  experts  appointed  by  the  Government  and \nagreed by ADB. Staff selected by the Panel will need endorsement by ADB. The organization \nchart for project implementation is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nTo assist the extremely poor households, the Project will use food-for-work schemes for \n46. \nimplementing simple civil works requiring unskilled workers. These works will mainly pertain to \nrehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage  facilities  and  potable  water  systems.  The  scheme  will \ntarget the extremely poor labor force members in the project communities paying them either in \nfood  or  the  minimum  wage  equivalent  that  is  prevalent  in  the  area.  The  local  communities  or \nother  similar  local  groups  will  be  tapped  to  identify  the  target  households.  Such  works  will  be \nmanaged by PIUs through force account procedures. \n \n47. \nNations security services to ensure safety during implementation.  \n \n\nThe  investment  activities  will  be  implemented  under  the  full  coverage  of  the  United \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n48. \nThe  project  components  will  be  implemented  during  6  years  starting  in  year  2003 \n(Appendix  5).  Project  activities  during  the  first  year  will  concentrate  on  the  fielding  of \nconsultants, procurement of equipment, development of operational systems for PMO and PIUs, \nand  training  of  their  staff.  The  civil  works  component  will  be  implemented  in  overlapping \npackages. The packages will be designed to ensure that on-farm, interfarm, and commissioned \ndrainage  facilities  are  completed  within  each  major  hydrologic  supply  and  drainage  unit  in  a \nstaged  fashion.  Field  surveys,  investigations,  and  preparation  of  detailed  designs  of  the  civil \nworks  of  Vakhsh  irrigation  system  will  be  conducted  in  the  first  year.  Establishment  of  WUAs \nand  their  training  will  also  be  initiated  in  the  first  year,  with  most  of  the  activities  conducted  in \nsecond  and  third  years.  For  potable  water  supply,  Kulyab  zone  will  be  rehabilitated  first, \nfollowed by Kistakuz-Gafurov and Gulkhandoz-Rasulov zones. \n \n\n\f13 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n49.  Machinery,  equipment,  civil  works,  and  services  for  rehabilitating  irrigation,  drainage, \nand  potable  water  supply  systems;  and  vehicles,  office  equipment,  and  materials  required  for \nproject  implementation  and  monitoring  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. To the extent possible, the Project will procure similar items in groups to optimize \nvolume  discounts.  Equipment  and  materials  procurement  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive \nbidding.  Contracts  costing  less  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \nshopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Small supply contracts costing less than $100,000 will \nbe procured through direct purchase. The award of contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n \nEach civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more will be \n50. \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  as \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  packages  costing  less  than  $1.0 \nmillion  will  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. For works whose size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive bidding, \nand if MWRLR has the facilities and capacity to implement these works expeditiously and at a \nreasonable  cost,  ADB  may  agree  to  force  account  procedures.  The  works  to  be  implemented \nthrough  force  account  will  be  determined  during  implementation.  The  upper  limit  for  a  force \naccount works package will be $50,000. The award of all civil works contracts will be subject to \napproval  by  ADB.  Poor  communities  will  be  helped  by  their  involvement  in  food-for-work \nprogram  (para.  46).  A  list  of  equipment  and  materials  to  be  procured  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F and a list of major contract packages is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n51. \nThe  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  1,951  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ninternational  and  1,862  person-months  of  domestic \ncomprising  89  person-months  of \nconsultants.  To  minimize  the  burden  of  consulting  services  costs,  input  of  international \nconsultants  has  been  kept  to  a  minimum  and  limited  to  areas  for  which  local  skills  are  not \nadequate. The consultants will assist MWRLR in (i) agriculture support services; (ii) institutional \ncapacity  building;  (iii)  surveys,  design,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  bid  evaluation  and \nconstruction supervision; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. The details \nof  consulting  services  inputs  and  outline  terms  of  reference  are  given  in  Appendix  7,  and \ndetailed  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G. The consulting services will be \nprovided by international consulting firm(s) in association with domestic consulting firm(s) to be \nengaged by MWRLR in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of the domestic consultants and using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n52. \nAfter loan effectiveness, an imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to \nADB, to facilitate the timely release of loan funds for making payments in local currency. During \nthe first year of implementation, the ceiling of the imprest account will be set at $500,000. The \nimprest  account  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \nand  other  procedures  to  be  agreed  on  by  ADB  and  the  Government.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  the  imprest \naccount for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per payment. \n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n1\n3\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n53.  MWRLR will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Loan proceeds will be used for \nengaging auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. Internal \naudit procedures will be developed in the PMO to improve financial management. \n \n54.  MWRLR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill  indicate  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  steps \ntaken  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress \nduring  the  remaining  implementation  period.  MWRLR will also provide such other reports and \ninformation  relating  to  the  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request,  including  the  Project\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. \nWithin 3 months after physical completion of the Project, MWRLR will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion  report  detailing,  among  others,  information  on  project  implementation,  use  of  the \nloan proceeds, and the extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished. \nThe Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which cover \nfailure  in  submitting  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  within  the  due  date.  A  formal \nwarning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue  and  disbursements will be \nsuspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe Project provides for an elaborate system of performance M&E (paras. 39-40). \n\n55. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  regularly  by  ADB  loan  review  missions.  During  the  third \n56. \nyear  of  its  implementation,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  carry  out  a  midterm  review  to \nassess the achievement of project objectives and implementation milestones. The achievement \nof project objectives will be measured against the performance criteria listed in Appendix 1. The \nparameters  for  assessing  the  implementation  milestones  will  include  (i)  implementation status, \n(ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  physical  progress  made  and  disbursements  in \nrelation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv)  performance  of  the  consultants  and  contractors, \nand  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the \nProject will also be reassessed. The midterm review will also assess the need for any additional \nworks or changes in the project scope. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n57. \nA  grant  of  $960,000  equivalent  financed  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan  will  provide  the  services  of  27  person-months  of  international  and  54 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  resolving \naccumulated  farm  debts;  and  (ii)  promoting,  implementing, and monitoring the policy reforms \nparticularly  in  areas  of  agriculture  marketing  and  water  resources  management.  The  TA  will \ndevelop  a  debt  resolution  strategy  after  reviewing  all  contracts  that  have  resulted  in \naccumulated  debts.  Such  analysis  will  help  in  firming  up  the  debt  amounts,  assigning \nresponsibility for debt to various parties, and identifying amounts that need to be written off or \nrescheduled. To help Tajikistan fetch better prices for its cotton, the TA will assist in establishing \nunique  grades  for  Tajikistan  cotton  that  are  recognized  in  the  international  markets.  For  rapid \n\n\f15 \n\npromotion  of  policy  reforms,  the  TA  will  launch  an  information  awareness  campaign  for  the \nfarmers. The project areas will serve as case study areas with the intention that conclusions and \nlessons drawn can be replicated elsewhere. Details of the TA are in Appendix 8. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n1. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses \n\n58. \nEconomic and financial analyses were carried out to justify the economic viability of the \nProject and financial viability of the participating farms. Economic analysis was carried out for \nthe core components, which include irrigation and drainage improvements,  agricultural support \nservices, and associated institutional support. The main quantifiable benefits of the investment \ncome from the reversal of production decline and increased crop yields and cropping intensity. \nA similar analysis for the potable water supply component has not been carried out due to the \nnature  and  size  of  the  investment,  and  lack  of  a  reliable  database.  Public  health  statistics  are \ndistorted  and  unreliable,  which  might  have  provided  a  basis  for  estimating  the  costs  of \nwaterborne diseases, and the costs of possible interventions can only be roughly approximated \nwithout  reference  to  the  hydrological  conditions  of  specific  sites.  The  Project  has  adopted  a \nleast-cost approach in selecting the potable water supply systems to be reconstructed. \n \n59. \nQuantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  basically  from  increases  in  agricultural  production, \nwhich  will  be  an  accumulative  effect  of  increases  in  yields,  cultivated  areas,  and  cropping \nintensity.  These  improvements  will  result  from  a  higher  level  of  and  dependable  irrigation \nsupplies,  better  drainage,  and  adoption  of  improved  technologies.  The  average  cotton  yield  is \nexpected to increase from 1.5 to 2.4 t/ha and wheat from 1.2 to 2.0 t/ha. Under the Project, the \ncropping  intensity  is  expected  to  increase  from  current  of  100%  to  121%.  Annual  cotton \nproduction in the project area is expected to increase from 66,909 to 131,812 t and wheat from \n42,917 to 69,758 t until year 9 and stabilize thereafter. \n \n60. \nThe Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) has been estimated at 22.9% with \nan economic net present value of $29.1 million. The sensitivity analysis was conducted to test \nthe effect of key factors of economic viability. Overall, the Project\u2019s EIRR was rather robust to \nadverse  effects  of  price  and  yield  declines,  project  benefit  delays,  and  investment  cost \nincreases,  producing  in  all  cases  the  EIRR  considerably  higher  than  the  acceptable  minimum \n(12%). Also, to illustrate the financial viability of farms in the project area, indicative farm models \nfor a large non-dehkan (1,400 ha) and a dehkan farm (17 ha) were developed for each of the \nthree  project  areas.  Significant  project  impacts  are  expected  on  both  large  (non-dehkan) and \nsmall  (dehkan)  farms.  The  net  farm  incomes  are  projected  to  increase  until  year  9,  then  to \nstabilize. By year 9, the large farms are estimated to make a net annual income of $186-260/ha, \nand  small  farms  $190-300/ha.  Details  of  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  given  in \nAppendix 9 and detailed tables are given in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact on Environment \n\n61. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  very  positive  effect  on  the  project  areas  environments.  The \nProject  is  designed  to  alleviate  social,  economic,  environmental,  and  health  problems.  It  will \npromote farm privatization and assist the transition to a market-oriented agricultural sector, thus \nleading  to  more  efficient  management  of  natural  resources.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  key \nelements  of  major  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  thereby  reducing  water  losses,  increasing \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n1\n5\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\napplication  efficiencies,  and  lowering  groundwater  levels.  This  will  also  reduce  the  risk  of \nsecondary  salinization  and  reduce  inequities  in  water  distribution.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate \nand enhance the potable water supply distribution network and thus facilitate availability of good \nquality potable water to most of the population in the project area. This will improve the health \nand  thus  the  quality  of  life  of  the  project  beneficiaries.  Improvements  in  O&M  will  lead  to \nsustained benefits and will help check environmental degradation. The environmental screening \nprocess has not identified any significant negative environmental impacts likely to be caused by \nthe Project. The summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix C \n \n\n3. \n\nImpact on Living Standards \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n62.  While the main beneficiaries of the Project will be those directly involved in the dehkan \nfarms and the collective farms that will be restructured in the project areas, the benefits accruing \nfrom the Project will redound to the poor residing in these areas. The widespread nature of rural \npoverty  in  the  project  sites  suggests  that  poverty  reduction  can  be  achieved  even  without  a \nfocus on specific vulnerable social groups in society. Of the total 471,500 rural population in the \nproject area, about 88% are below the poverty line, and most of them have garden plots for their \nsubsistence  requirements  and  have  access  to  irrigation.  For  households  with  inadequate \nirrigation,  improved  irrigation  will  enable  them  to  increase  their  cropping  intensity  to  two  or,  in \nexceptional cases, three crops in a year and increase in yields by at least 20%. Among the poor \nhouseholds  with  average  spending  of  TJS10-20/family/month  (45%  of  the  total  estimated \nnumber  of  project  beneficiaries),  improved  productivity  and  incomes  will  be  sufficient  to  move \nthem  out  of  poverty.  For  the  extremely  poor  (43%  of  project beneficiaries), improved yields in \ntheir  homestead  plots  will  augment  their  meager  food  resources.  Returns  to  farm  labor  will \nlikewise increase, with greater positive impact on the dehkan farms. With improved production, \nwage  payments  of  farm  workers  will  stabilize,  hence  reducing  the  uncertainties  arising  from \nirregular pay schedule. Intensive cropping practices will raise person-day requirements for farm \nlabor and increase demand for casual work by 10-15%. In sum, the Project\u2019s prospective impact \nwill  be  to  reduce  poverty  incidence  from  the  present  88%  to  43%.12  Impoverished  people, \nconstituting about 4% of those in the project area, will be greatly benefited by the food-for-work \nscheme (para. 46). The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 10. \n \n63. \nDuring  project  preparation,  many  poor  households  identified  access  to  quality  drinking \nwater as one of their primary concerns. In Khojabakirgan, about 25% of the people have access \nto water supply and more than 50% obtain their water from open ditches, 33% from water pipes, \nand  less  than  5%  buy  water  delivered  through  tanker  trucks.  In  the  Khatlon  region,  less  than \n20%  have  access  to  water  supply  and  more  than  75%  obtain  their  water  from  open  ditches. \nSome people walk as far as 10 kilometers to collect water for domestic use; in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu, \nqueuing for water takes as much as 6 hours. In all these areas, many of the water fetchers are \nchildren  and  women.  Because  of  the  poor  quality  of  potable  water,  a  large  proportion  of  the \nproject  area\u2019s  population  is  suffering  from  waterborne  diseases.13  Under  the  Project,  potable \nwater  supply  systems  will  be  constructed  in  villages  (paras.  35-37)  selected  by  the  criteria  of \n\n                                                 \n12   The  rural  population  whose  incomes  fall  just  below  the  poverty  threshold,  constituting  about  45%,  will  be  more \n\nresponsive to productivity improvements than those who belong to the extremely poor income echelon. \n\n13   In 2000, majority of villages in the project areas were afflicted by waterborne illnesses, and the proportion of the \npopulation  affected  is  much  higher  than  the  national  averages.  Specifically,  typhoid  cases  in  Kolkhozabad  were \n182%  of  the  national  average;  cases  of  dysentery  in  J  Rasulov  and  B  Gafurov  were  110%;  diarrhea  cases  in \nBoktar and Vakhsh were 217%; hepatitis cases in Kolkhozabad, J Rasulov, and B Gafurov were 206%; and for \nmalaria cases were 168% in Boktar, Vakhsh, Kolkhozabad, and Kulyab. \n\n\f17 \n\nseverity of access to drinking water and impact on the population. The Project will also provide \neducation  and  training  on  health  and  sanitation.  The  project  interventions  will  focus  on \nimproving the health conditions of the poor and vulnerable groups and lessening the burden for \nwomen and children in fetching water. This will enhance their overall quality of life. \n \n\nb. \n\nGender and Development \n\n64. \nAside  from  fetching  water,  women  contribute  in  the  household\u2019s  income  through \noccasional  work  during  harvesting,  farming  in  the  garden  plots,  and  performing  household \nchores.  In  Sughd  for  instance,  women  comprised  about  half  of  the  cooperative  teams  in \nagriculture enterprises, performing strenuous tasks in cotton production activities and obtaining \naverage  farm  wages.  Many  men  in  Khatlon  and  some  in  Sughd  have  left  to  seek  work  in  the \nlarger cities or abroad, leaving the women to manage the family and the garden plots. With the \nProject,  a  more  reliable  water  supply  will  enable  output  to  be  increased  thereby  easing  the \nburden of providing the family with an adequate diet. A gender strategy and plan with specific \ngender targets has been prepared (Appendix 10). \n \n\nc. \n\nImproved Rural Institutions \n\n65. \nThe  project  is  focused  on  enabling  poor  rural  communities  to  acquire  greater  control \nover  the  water  supplies,  which  influence  in  large  measure  their  standard  of  living.  The  Project \nwill  facilitate  the  creation  of  rural  institutions  (WUAs  and  WSCs)  that  will  empower  the \nbeneficiary  communities  to  manage  irrigation  and  potable  water  supplies,  organize  water \ndistribution,  and  arrange  O&M  of  their  systems.  Stakeholder  participation  will  assure  more \nefficient  and  effective  allocation  of  the  scarce  water  resource  in  a  sustainable  manner,  which \ncan  serve  as  a  stepping  stone  for  the  establishment  of  community-based  governance \nmechanisms  that  will  catalyze  for  more  local  and  specific  development  undertakings.  The \ntraining  of  MWRLR  staff  will  create  efficient  and  effective  service  providers  responsive  to  the \nneeds of its clients. They will work closely with the WUAs and WSCs in ensuring that the water \nresources are properly allocated and utilized, that the facilities are maintained in a sustainable \nmanner,  and  that  water-related  problems  are  addressed  in  a  participatory  fashion.  The \nsynergistic  relationship  between  the  rural  institutions  and  the  government  agency  will  help \nimprove the agriculture sector\u2019s growth performance in the project areas and reduce poverty. \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nThe  project  activities  will  be  subject  to  a  number  of  natural  and  country-specific risks. \n66. \nThe  country  is  prone  to  periodic  earthquakes  and  flooding.  Very  little  can  be  done  about the \nformer,  but  efforts  are  being  made  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  flooding.14  The project sites  were \nselected with particular attention to avoid the undue risks of these natural calamities. \n \n67. \nAccumulated  farm  debts  are  also  considered  as  a  major  risk,  affecting  farmers\u2019 \nproduction incentives and financial sustainability of many cotton farms.  The issue of farm debts \nis  complex  and  requires  a  careful  approach  in  addressing  associated  issues  encompassing \ninput and output marketing, rural financing, farm restructuring policies, and governance. ADB is \nassisting  the  Government  to  address  these  issues  in  a  judicious  and  transparent  manner \nthrough  participatory  dialogue  with  stakeholders,  including  farmers,  private  investors,  local \nadministrations,  and  central  government  authorities.  The  Government  is  committed  to  resolve \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2001.

The  Project\u2019s  associated TA \nwill assist the task force.  \n \nThe  possibility  of  renewed  civil  conflict  remains  but  is  receding  as  the  peace  accord  is \n68. \nsustained. A proportion of the river flow supplying the Khojabakirgan irrigation system emanates \nfrom Kyrgystan and its flows are subject to control by the Kyrgyz authorities. The water share is, \nhowever,  protected  by  the  water  agreement  among  the  Central  Asian  republics  and  it  is \nexpected that the agreement will be respected. \n \n69. \nTajikistan\u2019s  agencies  associated  with  agriculture  sector  have  been  involved  during  the \nlast 3 years with the World Bank\u2019s ongoing Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project in policy \nreforms  involving  long-term  complex  processes.  The  proposed  Project  will  be  the  ADB\u2019s  first \nmajor  investment  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  the  second  with  MWRLR.15  The  risk  of \nimplementation delays arising from MWRLR\u2019s unfamiliarity with ADB procedure has been partly \nmitigated  by  involving  MWRLR  staff  during  project  processing.  Their  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures will be enhanced through seminars and during the administration missions. \n \n70. \nAt  the  project  level,  the  benefits  of  the  investment  will  be  much  reduced  if  (i)  the  farm \nprivatization process is delayed, (ii) old farm management practices and administrative controls \nover production and marketing are not eliminated, or (iii) the marketing arrangements for cotton \nare not improved. In general, the informal barriers to trade and to a fair return to the producer \nmust  be  significantly  reduced  if  farmers  are  to  achieve  any  measurable  benefit  from  growing \ncotton. These issues are being addressed under the policy reforms being implemented.  \n \n71. \nSustainability of the project benefits will be threatened if proper O&M arrangements are \nnot  in  place  and/or  the  beneficiaries  fail  to  meet  the  O&M  costs  after  the  10  year  transition \nperiod. This failure may result from an improper legal framework, inadequate organization and \ntraining of the WUAs and WSCs or inadequate capacity of the beneficiaries to pay. The system \nbenefits  could  also  be  reduced  if  the  project  systems  are  not  maintained  properly.  All  these \naspects  are  being  addressed  under  the  Project,  and  appropriate  assurances  have  been \nobtained \nin \nfrom \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \n\nthe  proposed  O&M  arrangements  are \n\nthe  Government.

The Government will \ntake  appropriate  measures,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  to  recover  the  costs \nassociated with such supplies. \nDuring project implementation, the PMO and PIUs will be provided with adequate \nstaff, office premises, and resources for their effective operation. \nThe  Government  will  establish  three  FMUs,  initially  as  state-owned enterprises, \nbut will gradually offer their equity stakes to the public with the intention that by \nproject completion their majority shares will be owned by the private sector. \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  (a)  the  FMUs  operate  on  commercial  basis \nand rent their machinery against a service fee determined at commercial rates, \nand (b) service fees are used for repayment of their respective subsidiary loans \nand towards administrative costs, and O&M cost of the machinery. \nThe Government shall, in consultation with ADB, develop a program for recovery \nof  O&M  costs  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  rehabilitated  under  the \nProject  on  a  phased  basis  over  a  period  of  10  years  in  accordance  with  the \nrelevant  Government  policies  and  existing  agreements  with  the  International \nDevelopment  Association.  The  Government  shall  review  the  collection  rates \nannually and report to ADB, taking also into account the inkind payments. \n(viii)  Adequate  annual  budgetary  allocations  will  be  made  and  funds  released  on  a \ntimely  basis  for  O&M  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  in \nparticular  for  the  primary  infrastructure  such  as  reservoirs  and  large  interstate \ncanals, until these costs have been recovered from the beneficiaries. \nThe  Government  will  take  into  account  the  recommendations  of  the  associated \nTA and take all necessary action to ensure that within 1 year of the completion of \nthe  TA,  the  regulatory  framework  and  administrative  measures  are  in  place  to \nenable effective functioning of the WUAs and WSCs. \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  (a)  a  dialogue  is  established  between  the \ntargeted  communities  and  the  concerned  sector  agencies  with  respect  to \norganization of WUAs; (b) WUAs are organized through a participatory process; \nand  (c)  the  level  and  role  of  female  participation  is  promoted  in  formulation, \norganization, and management of WUAs. \nThe  Government  will  transfer  operation  and  management  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage  facilities  and  local  potable  water  supply  systems  to  the  WUAs  and \nWSCs, respectively, after they are fully organized and trained, but not later than \n2 years after rehabilitation of their infrastructure is complete. \nThe village water networks will remain in public ownership but their operation and \nmanagement will be taken over by WSCs not later than 1 year after rehabilitation \nof their infrastructure is complete. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xiii)  The  Project  will  be  carried  out,  and  all  facilities  constructed,  operated, \nmaintained, and monitored, in accordance with the existing laws, regulations, and \nstandards  of  the  Government  concerning  environmental  protection  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agricultural  and  Natural  Resources \nDevelopment Projects  and the relevant guidelines for irrigation and water supply \nprojects. \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n1\n9\n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(xiv)   The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  an  appropriate  budgetary  allocation  is  made  for \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  by  MWRLR  and  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental  Protection,  including  for  vehicles,  materials  and  equipment,  and \noperating  expenses  relating  to  all  environmental  management  and  monitoring \naspects  of  the  Project,  as  specified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination \nreport. \nThe Borrower will ensure the implementation of the gender strategy and plan with \nspecific  targets.

Cotton  yields  had \ndeclined  markedly  from  the  preindependence  average  of  more  than  2  t/hectare  (ha)  to  the \n1997\u20132001  average  of  1.52  t/ha.  However,  cotton  yields  significantly  improved  to  1.76  t/ha in \n2001, due to favorable weather and use of adequate and timely agricultural inputs.  \n\n2. \nPresent  legislation  allows farmers  to  grow  the  crop  of  their  choice;  there  are  no  state \norders.  In  practice,  cotton  production  remains  highly  controlled,  especially  at  the  local  level. \nLocal  administrations,  if  necessary,  are  able  to  ensure  that  a  given  area  grows  cotton  and \nallocate resources and inputs to the specific farms. \n\nB. \n\nProduction, Processing, and Marketing \n\n3. \nTajikistan  was  a  major  suppliers  of  cotton  fiber  to  the  former  Soviet  economy.  After \nindependence in 1991 and the collapse of the command economy,  Tajikistan\u2019s cotton lost both \nits  market  and  source  of  financing  of  production. To  keep  cotton production,  the Government \nprovided  direct  credit  to  the  state  farms,  through  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan.  The practice \nwas obviously not sustainable due to the country\u2019s weak fiscal capacity, and was terminated in \n1996  according  to  the  agreement  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  In  1997,  the \nGovernment  entered  into  an  agreement  to  borrow  and  guarantee  a  syndicated  loan  from  a \nbanking consortium led by Credit Suisse First Boston with the support of P. Reinhart, the world\u2019s \nsecond largest cotton trader. This was augmented by credits from other foreign financiers and \njoint venture trading companies. Reinhart  has  a  majority  shareholding  in  Tajikistan\u2019s principal \nagriculture bank, Agroinvest, which channels the funds to cotton growers through a number of \nlocal \n\u201cinvestors.\u201d \nlocal \nadministrations. Initially 35 investors were registered with the Cotton Exchange but now only 16 \nare active in business. At present Agroinvest Bank assigns investors to work in specific districts. \nFarmers enter into annual production contracts with the investor, which generally recovers the \nloan through acquisition of a proportion of the crop.  \n\nintermediary  companies  called \n\nInvestors  work  closely  with \n\n4. \nTajikistan is said to have  27 cotton ginneries but information is available for only 23. Of \nthe 23 ginneries, 20 have been privatized and the Government plans to private the remaining 3 \nin 2003. The ginneries have a range of shareholders; the Ministry of Agriculture is said to have \nretained  25%  of  shares  in  each  ginnery.  Some  investors  own  ginneries,  with  one  investor \nowning five of them.  There  are  inherent  monopolistic  tendencies  in  cotton  ginning,  especially \nwhere  there  is  only  one  ginnery  in  a  district.  Ginneries  have  complete  control  over  the \nspecifications of the quantity and quality of cotton fiber produced by their suppliers. There is no \nindependent assessor to whom farmers can turn if they are not satisfied with the ginneries\u2019 data. \nLegislation allows free movement and export of raw cotton, but in practice this is not always the \ncase.  Transport  costs  are  a  factor  but  some  local  administrations  prefer  that  raw  cotton  be \nprocessed locally to ensure that maximum use is made of local processing facilities \n\n5. \nAbout  30%  of  the  cotton  produced  is  consumed  in  the  domestic  market  and  the \nremaining 70% is exported through Riga, Latvia, with P. Reinhart  acting as the main exporter, \ncatering  for  about  95%  of  the  cotton  export.  The  marketing  of  cotton  is  regulated  by  the  Tajik \nUniversal  Goods  and  Raw  Materials  Exchange.  The  exchange  issues  the  necessary  export \ncertificates and verifies that the price paid in the contract is in accordance with its regulations. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n \n\n \n\n27 \n\nThe local \u201cborder price\u201d is kept to within 5% of the international price based upon the Liverpool \nCotton Exchange daily prices. The exchange holds weekly auctions for cotton but the amounts \nauctioned  remain  small  (less  than  5,000  t  annually)  because  the  amount  of  \u201cfree\u201d  cotton  (that \nnot linked to credit agreements) remains small.  \n\nC. \n\nFarm Debt \n\n6. \nProfitability of cotton declined  significantly  in  the  recent  years, due to  low  international \nmarket  prices  and  low  yields  resulting  from  untimely  and  inadequate  inputs,  inadequate \nirrigation  supplies,  soil  salinization,  and  a  high  water  table  because  of  poor  drainage.  The \noriginal  syndicated  loan  of  $60  million  that  the  Government  borrowed  in  1997  from  an \ninternational  banking  consortium  (para.  3)  was  not  fully  repaid  and  has  since  become  an \nannually rolled over financing facility for cotton production. The outstanding debt to this facility \ngrew  appreciably  during  1997-1999  but  the  rate  of  increase  has  moderated  over  the  past  2 \nyears.  \n\nThe  cotton  crop  requires  about  $65  million  annually  in  working  capital,  of  which  about \n7. \n8% is estimated to come from farmers own resources. Thus farmers need to borrow about $60 \nmillion annually in working capital. The cost of funds to Agroinvest Bank is about LIBOR+8% or \napproximately  10%  at  current  interest  rates.  Agroinvest  Bank  lends  to  the  local  investor \ncompanies at interest rates of 12%/annum. The local investors do not charge a specific margin \nbut  use  several  mechanisms  to  cover  their  administration  and  funding  costs,  including  a \ncommission on the provision of inputs, control of ginning margins, and control of the amount of \nfiber returned or assigned to the farmer. \n\n8. \nThis financing system is extremely expensive for the farmer who remains the beneficiary \nof  last  resort.  In  effect,  the  producer  is  at  the  end  of  a  financing  chain,  which  ensures  that  all \nthose  involved  are  paid  before  the  producer.  As  a  result  of  low  yields  and  low  international \ncotton prices, there are not sufficient resources in the system to enable everyone to achieve a \nreasonable  return  on  their  investment.  Consequently,  farms  are  accumulating  debt.  About \n20,000 t of cotton, which is about 3-4% of the production at state and collective farms, remains \nunharvested because of the lack of farm machinery and incentives among workers. The annual \ncotton  subsector  revenues  in  2001  were  approximately  $111.2  million  based  on  that  year\u2019s \ncotton  output  and  prices.  From  this  amount,  a  total  of  $54.2  million  is  claimed  by  creditors, \nincluding  interest  on  debt.  This  leaves  a  residual  amount  of  $57.0  million  to  cover  all  farm \nproduction  costs.  However,  the  total  amount  of  finance  used  by  cotton  growers  in  2001  is \nestimated  at  $65.0  million,  leaving  a  deficit  of  about  $8.0  million  or  $30/ha  of  cotton.  These \nfigures relate to a relatively good production year when the average cotton yield was 1.8 t/ha. In \nprevious years, average yields have been as low as 1.3 t/ha. Thus, the explanation for the debt \nis a combination of factors, the most important of which is the relatively low productivity levels. \nAn  average  yield  of  2.5  t/ha  instead  of  1.8  t/ha  would  enable  the  subsector  to  become  self-\nfinancing. However, this is almost a 50% increase in productivity. To achieve this will require a \nmajor  investment  and  significant  structural  changes  within  the  agriculture  sector.  The  current \nsituation is also influenced by low world cotton prices and the high cost of funds to the farmer. \n\n9. \nThe cost of finance to the farmer is difficult to assess precisely, but it is estimated to be \nin  the  region  of  21%  annual  interest  rate  in  dollar  terms  after  allowing  for  all  charges  and \ncommissions.  Farmers  generally  complain  of  late  delivery  of  agricultural  inputs,  particularly \nfertilizers, and delays in payments for labor, particularly for cotton picking, which is due after the \ninvestors  take  possession  of  the  produce  and  are,  therefore,  least  concerned  to  pay. With the \n2001 international price of cotton fiber  at  $957/t,  the  Tajik  farm  gate  price  of  raw  cotton,  after \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n\ni\n\n \n\n2\n7\n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\naccounting for local storage and transport and ginning cost, is estimated at $193/t or about 20% \nof  the  international  price  of  fiber.  This  implies  that  the  farm  will  be  responsible  for  taxes  other \nthan sale tax, cost of funds, interest on debts, and utility bills. \n\nThe  system  of  cotton  balances  is  prepared  by  local  administrations  and  is  based  upon \n10. \nan assessment of the amount of the debt, which the cotton subsector will be required to repay in \na given season. The total debt \u201cbill\u201d is translated into a required area of cotton within a region or \ndistrict assuming certain productivity levels. This target area is allocated to farmers. The farmers \nwithout commercial debts are obligated only for their public sector charges. \n\n11. \nCountrywide, the accumulated debt of this facility at the end of 2001 was approximately \n$67 million, owed to Agroinvest Bank. In addition, farms have debt to a number of public sector \nagencies.  The  national  level  debts  of  $91.5  million  pertain  to  about  70%  of  the  irrigated  land. \nFarm debt varies from about $100/ha to more than $2,000/ha, averaging about $300/ha, which \nis  roughly  equivalent  to  one  year  of  cotton  revenues.  Servicing  this  debt  costs  at  least \n$36/ha/year. This is a significant element of total farm cost of production. Farms covering about \n40,000-50,000 ha area have enough resources and don\u2019t need production loans. \n\nD. \n\nA Plan for Recovery \n\nAt  the  Government\u2019s  request,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  arranged  in \n12. \nDushanbe  on  8  and  9  October  2002  the  Roundtable  on  Farm  Debts  and  Farm  Investment \nOpportunities.  A large number of  stakeholders, including farmers, local authorities, investors, \ncentral  government  officials,  nongovernmental  organization  and  external  funding  agencies, \nparticipated in the discussions. \n\n13. \nCandid  and  open  discussions  among  the  stakeholders,  conducted  for  the  first  time  in \nTajikistan, resulted in identification of number of problem areas. These included:  (i) inadequate, \nand  sometimes  unfair  contracts  executed  between  investors  and  farmers,  both  of  which  often \nlack  crucial  financial/business  management  capacities;  (ii)  lack  of  a  clear  farm  privatization \npolicy, particularly relating to transfer of accumulated farm debts; (iii) lack of alternative rural and \nmicro credit facilities; (iv) inadequacy of the existing collateral law, which does not allow trading \nof the land-use certificate, and as a result, severely constrains the credit-worthiness of farms; (v) \nand the decreasing  yield  and  increasingly  erratic  and  uncertain  irrigation  water  supply  due  to \ndeteriorating irrigation systems. \n\nStakeholders\u2019 discussions resulted in several general agreements, including (i) the need \n14. \nto  writeoff  or  reschedule  debts  to  Government  agencies,  such  as  utility  bills;  (ii)  the  need  to \nnegotiate  with  investors  to  reschedule  the  accumulated  debts  based  on  mutually  agreed \nbusiness  and  farm  production  plans,  which  need  to  be  prepared  for  each  farm;  (iii)  capacity \nbuilding for improved farm management and stricter financial management  of heavily indebted \nfarms; (iv) measures to accelerate production increases for farms without heavy debts; and (v) \npromotion of public awareness of farmers\u2019 rights and available options to modify the production \ncontracts, including provision of preproduction credit in cash, sale of raw cotton, etc. \n\n15. \nThe  roundtable  discussions  were  concluded  with  a  specific  recommendation  for  the \nGovernment to establish a special  task force to (i) develop a debt resolution strategy,  including \nexamining the debt amounts in various categories (e.g., principal, interest, and penalties), and \nidentifying  directed  credit,  if  any,  and  violations  of  the  contract  terms  on  either  party,  and (ii) \nthe  consensus  and \nmonitoring \nthe \nrecommendations  at \n\nreforms,  based  on \nroundtable  discussions.  The  Government  accepted \n\nimplementation  of  policy \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n\frecommendations, and subsequently requested ADB to provide technical assistance to support \nthe  task  force  (Appendix  8,  Technical  Assistance  for  Farm  Debt  Resolution  and  Policy \nReforms). \n\nAppendix 3 \n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n\ni\n\n \n\n2\n9\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n\nTable A4.1: Expenditure Accounts by Financiers\n($ '000)\n\n3\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nItem\n\nSource\n\nBeneficiaries Govt. of Tajikistan\n\nADB\n\nTotal\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\n(Excl.\nTaxes)\n\nDuties\n&\nTaxes\n\nA.

In  general,  comparisons  of  costs  and \nbenefits in the  analysis  of  projects  are  made  on  the  basis  of  quantifiable  physical  inputs  and \noutputs.  Incremental  net  benefits  are  estimated,  where  possible,  on  the  basis  of  the  changes \nexpected to occur and other conditions expected to prevail within targeted geographic areas (i) \nin  the  absence  of  the  proposed  project\u2019s  interventions,  and  (ii)  as  a  consequence  of \nimplementing  the  proposed  interventions.  For  the  economic  analysis  these  quantifiable  inputs \nand  outputs  are  valued  according  to  their  border  price  equivalents. For the financial analysis, \nestablished prices are applied as determined by local markets. \n\n2. \nThe  principal  objective  of  the  economic  analysis  is  to  establish  whether  proposed \ninvestments  are  profitable  for  the  economy  as  a  whole,  which  is  determined  when  the  net \npresent  value  of  costs  and  benefits  are  positive  when  discounted  at  the  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital. \n\n3. \nThe  irrigation  component  particularly  lends  itself  to  quantitative  analysis  based  on  the \nexpected performance of agricultural production dependent upon the infrastructure of the three \nschemes under consideration. In addition to farm level costs, the project costs associated with \ninfrastructure rehabilitation, agricultural machinery services, support to establishments of water \nusers\u2019  associations  and  project  management  and  monitoring  costs  have  been  included  in  the \neconomic  and  financial  analysis.  For  the  whole  project  analysis,  crop  and  area-wide  farm \nbudgets have been estimated for each proposed scheme, then aggregated at the project level.  \n\n4. \nThe economic analysis has been carried out in two stages. The first stage is concerned \nwith  the  economic  viability  of  selected  crops  in  two  settings,  one  without  the  project  and  the \nother with project interventions. These are assessed using economic crop budgets for the two \nsituations. The second stage is the determination of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). \nThis requires the aggregation of the results of the budgetary analyses weighted according to the \nprojected  cropping  patterns.  The  EIRR  of  the  Project  is  based  on  the  incremental  benefits \nresulting from project interventions. \n\n5. \nA  similar  analysis  of  the  potable  water  supply  component  is  not  possible  due  to  the \nnature  of  the  activity  and  the  data  available  for  an  assessment.  Not  only  are  public  health \nstatistics distorted and unreliable, which might have provided a basis for estimating the costs of \nwaterborne  diseases,  the  costs  of  possible  interventions  themselves  can  only  be  roughly \napproximated  without  reference  to  the  hydrological  conditions  of  specific  sites.  The  best \napproach in this case is to present a least-cost argument that, given the information available at \nthe time of the preparation, the proposed investment options in terms of cost per beneficiary are \ncomparable to norms of similar water supply investments elsewhere.  \n\nAlso, to illustrate the financial viability of farms in the project area, indicative farm models \n6. \nfor  a  large  non-dehkan1  (1,400  hectare  [ha])  and  a  dehkan  farm  (17  ha)  were  developed  for \neach of the three project areas. \n\n                                                 \n1   A dehkan farm is a privately-managed farm. Currently, an average nondehkan (cooperative) farm has about 1,400 \nha  of  cultivated  land.  However,  as  a  result  of  the  ongoing  process  of  farm  reorganization,  dehkan  farms  are \nemerging at the expense of cooperative farms\u2019 land. The average size of dehkan farm is to be around 17 ha. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n\ni\n\n \n\n4\n5\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n46 \n \n\nB. \n\nLand Area, Cropping Pattern, and Yields \n\n7. \nThe  total  project  area  in  the  three  regions  covers  approximately  85,000  ha  of  irrigated \nland  and  has  approximately  471,500  beneficiaries.  The  two  major  crops  in  the  project  area\u2014\ncotton  and  wheat\u2014annually  use  around  50%  and  39%  of  the  irrigated  cropland,  respectively. \nOn  the  remaining  11%  of  irrigated  cropland,  several  minor  crops  including  fodder,  vegetables, \nand  fruits  are  planted.  Depending  on  particular  regions  and  individual  irrigation  systems,  the \ncurrent  crop  yields  in  the  project  area  vary  considerably:  for  cotton,  between  0.7  and  1.8  tons \n(t)/ha and for wheat, 0.8 and 2.0 t/ha. \n\nC. \n\nMajor Assumptions \n\nMany  large  farms  in  the  project  area  are  unprofitable  and  have  significant  debt,  partly \n8. \ndue to their inability to repay production loans. With the resolution of debts, the large farms are \nlikely to reorganize into dehkan farms able to make their own farming decisions. The Project will \nfacilitate  resolution  of  the  debts  and  the  reorganization  process  and  thereby  creating  equal \nopportunities for land allocations. \n\n9. \nMany farms, particularly the large ones, have been unprofitable in recent years caused \nby  (i)  declining  crop  productivity  due  to  deteriorating  conditions  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage \nsystems, (ii) multiple and high taxes, and (iii) low and unstable prices for their crops.  \n\n10.  With the Project, crop yields are expected to increase progressively for 9 years: (i) cotton \nfrom 1.5 to 2.4 t/ha, (ii) wheat from 1.2 to 2.0 t/ha. Without the Project, crop yields are expected \nto decline to 1.2 t/ha for cotton and 1.0 t/ha for wheat. In addition, a significant loss in irrigated \narea is expected under the without the Project The projected yield improvements are relatively \nmodest  since  the  rehabilitation  will  focus  on  improving  of  primary  and  secondary  canals. \nHowever, since the Project will be providing agricultural support services on 6,000 ha on a pilot \nbasis, the projected yield increases are expected to be modest and to take effect gradually. No \nyield  improvements  are  assumed  until  year  5,  when  many  of  the  rehabilitation  works  will  be \ncomplete. \n\n11.  With the Project, the cropping intensity is expected to increase from 100% to 121%. This \nassumption varies between subproject sites, depending on the current situation and feasibility of \nfuture  irrigation.  For  instance,  with  the  Project,  the  cropping  intensity  in  Khojabakirgan  is \nexpected to increase by 31%, in Vakhsh by 15% and in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu by 13%. \n\n12.  Without the Project, the current levels of inputs are likely to continue to be used over an \nessentially declining areas of adequately irrigated land and the cost of energy will remain at its \ncurrent low level. However, with the Project, the farmers are expected to increase their use of \nfertilizers and adopt integrated pest management techniques. With the Project, the introduction \nof short-season varieties of oilseeds, maize, and pulses will encourage the growing of two crops \nper year where the water resources are adequate. These crops are grown already on household \nplots and on some farms but the varieties are old and not suitable for more intensive cropping \nsystems.  The  introduction  of  better  varieties  with  shorter  growing  seasons  will  produce  more \nbalanced  crop  rotations  and  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  farms  to  increase  incomes  to  help \nmeet the increased cost of irrigation system operation and maintenance (O&M). \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n \n\n47 \n\n13.  With the Project, energy costs will be raised to the long run marginal cost of production, \nassessed  at  $0.02/kilowatt-hour,2  from  the  current  level  of  $0.005/kilowatt-hour.  These \nadjustments in electricity tariffs will, in turn, increase the cost of providing water to farms. As a \nresult, for irrigation schemes that primarily use water pumped to heights of over 100 meters, the \nnominal costs of water use are expected to increase substantially. That is especially the case of \nproject areas in Sughd region, where the use of pump irrigation is prevalent. \n\n14. \nSimilarly,  water  charges  will  be  increased  gradually  to  reflect  the  full  cost  recovery  of \nO&M costs and water users\u2019 associations will begin to levy their own O&M charges to sustain \non-farm systems. Producers are likely to respond to a more reliable water supply by using more \ninputs to attain significant improvements in productivity.  \n\nThe economic analyses were conducted for a period of 20 years in 2002 constant prices \n15. \nand in United States (US) dollars. Year 1 is year 2003, the year in which the Project is expected \nto commence. \n\nThe  official  exchange  rate  of  TJS2.68/$1.00  prevailing  at  the  time  of  appraisal  (March \n16. \n2002) was used in the analyses. Direct and indirect local currency contents of input and output \nprices were converted to US dollars using the official exchange rate.  \n\n  Cotton,  wheat,  and  fertilizer  prices  were  projected  using  the  World  Bank\u2019s  commodity \n17. \nprice projections. Adjustments for transport, handling, storage, insurance, intermediary margins, \nand  physical  losses  were  made  for  determining  farmgate  prices.  The  financial  and  economic \nfarmgate  prices  of  urea,  potassium  chloride,  and  phosphate  were  derived  on  an  import  parity \nbasis.  \n\n18. \nAs Tajikistan is a net wheat importer, the farmgate prices of wheat were derived on an \nimport parity basis. The projected international prices of wheat (free on board [FOB], US) for US \nno.1  hard  red  winter  wheat  were  used  for  estimating  the  equivalent  border  wheat prices after \nadjustments for quality, freight and insurance costs, and charges for handling and transport. In \nderiving  farmgate  prices  of  wheat,  further  adjustments  to  the  border  prices  were  made  to \naccount for costs associated with elevator storage, physical losses, drying, and local transport. \n\n19. \nAs  Tajikistan  is  a  cotton  exporter,  the  farmgate  price  of  seed  cotton  (raw  cotton)  was \nderived  on  an  export-parity  basis.  The  economic  price  of  cotton  is  based  on  the  \u2018Index  A\u2019 \ncomposite  price  for  cotton  traded  in  northern  Europe.  It  was  derived  from  the  projected \ninternational  prices  of  cotton  fiber  (cost,  insurance,  and  freight;  Europe),  by  adjusting  for  (i) \nquality  discount  for  Tajikistan  average  grades;3  (ii)  railway  transport  and  insurance;  (iii) \nintermediary costs including ginning costs; and (iv) the value of by-products such as seeds, fluff, \nand lint. On the average, the quantity of fiber produced amounts to about 32% of seed cotton by \nweight. The value of by-products represents about 14% of the value of the fiber equivalent. \n\n20. \n  The  economic  analysis  was  based  on  the  world  price  numeraire,  and  adjustments  to \nfinancial prices were made to reflect the removal of sales taxes for cotton, and the application of \na  Standard  Conversion  Factor  of  0.9  to  the  domestic  resources. The basic wage rates on the \nfarms in 2002 were estimated at $1.4/day. Given a situation of less than full employment in the \nrural areas, a Shadow Wage Rate Factor of 0.8 was used in the analysis.  \n                                                 \n2   Estimates by World Bank staff for their recent Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project. \n3   Uzbekistan supplies the bulk of cotton originating from Central Asia. Uzbek cotton consistently trades slightly below \nthe  Index  A  price-approximately  5%  lower.  For  the  analysis,  the  value  of  Uzbek  seed  cotton  traded  in  northern \nEurope serves to establish an upper limit to the economic value of cotton seed in Tajikistan at the farm gate. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n\ni\n\n \n\n4\n7\n\n \n\n\f48 \n \n\nD. \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nBenefits \n\n21. \nThe benefits from irrigation and drainage rehabilitation were derived from prevention of \nfurther decline of crop yields and expected increases in crop yields. With-project, the expected \nannual  production  levels  of  the  cultivated  crops  are  estimated  to  rise  steadily  till  year  9:  for \ncotton  from  66,909  t  to  131,812  t,  and  for  wheat,  from  42,917  t  to  69,758  t  and  stabilize \nafterwards. Without-project, the annual crop production levels would continually decline and in \nyear 9 would reach the production levels of 34,420 t for cotton and 23,404 t for wheat. \n\nE. \n\nEconomic Internal Rates of Return \n\n22.  With  economic  prices  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  world  price  numeraire,  the  overall \nEIRR  of  the  Project  was  estimated  at  22.9%,  with  an  economic  net  present  worth  of  $29.1 \nmillion at the discount rate of 12%. \n\nF. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nThe sensitivity of EIRR to declines in prices, yields, and project benefits; and decrease in \n\n23. \nproject benefits and increase in investment costs are presented in Table A9.1. \n\nIf  cotton  and  wheat  prices  fall  by  10%  throughout  the  entire  project  period,  the  ERR \n24. \nwould decline to 18.2% and if cotton and wheat yields fall by 10% during that period, the EIRR \nwould decline to 17.6%. Similarly, if the project benefits decrease by 10%, the EIRR would fall \nto 19% and the delays in project benefit by 1 year would move the EIRR to 17.0%. If the project \ninvestment cost is increased by 10%, the EIRR would decrease to 21.7%. The switching value \nresults suggest that, for the net present value to fall to zero, the cotton and wheat price need to \ndecline  by  20%,  their  yield  by  18%,  or  project  benefits  by  24%.  And  other  factors  remaining \nunchanged,  an  increase  by  37%  in  project  investment  cost  will  bring  the  net  present  value  to \nzero. Overall, the project EIRRs are not overly sensitive to possible adverse effects such as the \ndeclines in prices, yields, benefits streams/delays in benefit streams or increases in investment \ncosts.  In  all  cases  EIRRs,  are  well  above  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  acceptable  rate  of \n12%. \n\nTable A9.1: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \n\nItem \n\nBase Case \n\nDeclines in Cotton and Wheat Prices \n\nDeclines in Cotton and Wheat Yields \n\nDeclines in Project Benefits  \n\nDelays in Project Benefits \n\nIncreases in Investment Costs \n\n \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nChange \n(%) \n\n \n\n-10 \n\n-10 \n\n-10 \n\nOne year \n\n+10 \n\nNet \nPresent \nValue \n($ million) \n\n29.1 \n\n14.8 \n\n13.8 \n\n17.2 \n\n16.4 \n\n27.0 \n\n22.9 \n\n18.2 \n\n17.6 \n\n19.0 \n\n17.0 \n\n21.7 \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nSensitivity \nIndicator \n\nSwitching \nValue \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n4.91 \n\n5.52 \n\n4.09 \n\n \n\n0.73 \n\n20 \n\n18 \n\n24 \n\n \n\n+37 \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n \n\n49 \n\nG. \n\nFinancial Analysis: Farm Budgets \n\n25. \nBased on the analytical models developed to assess the performance of the Project in \nthe  three  irrigation  schemes,  farm  budgets  were  estimated  for  each  of  the  three  subproject \nareas.  These  allow  determination  of  the  extent  of  incentives  for  farmers  to  participate  in  the \nProject and of the Project\u2019s expected impact on farmers. \n\n26. \nFor future farm budget projections, it is assumed that current distortions in the incentive \nstructure to agriculture will be removed in line with Government policy and that all farm types will \noperate in the same incentive framework. Farm budgets of dehkan farms are expected to differ \nfrom  those  of  large  farms  in  several  ways.  In  cropping  pattern,  dehkan  farms  are  assumed  to \nhave  greater  share  of  wheat  than  large  farms,  since  many  dehkan  farms  operate  on  a \nsubsistence basis and prefer food crops. In addition, yields per hectare of cotton and wheat on a \nportion  of  dehkan  farms  (about  10%  of  land)  are  25%  higher  than  average  yields  due  to \nintensive on-farm trials on improvements of soil and water management and introduction of new \nseeds.  Also,  fixed  and  overhead  costs  at  dehkan  farms  are  expected  to  be  15%  lower  than \nthose  at  large  farms,  since  the  former  do  not  entail  huge  management  and  other  costs  that \ntypical large farms involve. \n\n27. \nFor comparative purposes, farm budgets were prepared for both large (non-dehkan) and \nsmall (dehkan) farms, which are expected to exist in the future, either with or without the Project \n(Tables A9.2-A9.3). Large (non-dehkan) farms are essentially restructured state-farms, typically \noperating  on  around  1,400  ha,  whereas  small  farms  are  principally  individual  dehkan  farms, \noperating  on  around  17  ha  of  land.  Although  both  farm  types  are  expected  to  have  similar \nvariable  cost  structures  for  a  given  crop,  they  have  very  different  fixed  costs  and  overheads. \nThese  are  taken  into  account  during  budget  construction.  The  analysis  assumed  that  water \ncharges  would  be  increased  gradually  to  reflect  full  recovery  of  O&M  costs.  The  net  farm \nincome  for  large  and  small  farms  should  reflect  the  returns  to  the  farm  management.  It  is \nassumed  that  returns  to  farm  management  represent  the  main  incentives  to  participate  in  the \nproject. \n\n28. \nGiven  proper  incentives,  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  non-dehkan  farms  is  expected  to  be \nsignificant.  The  large  farms  in  Khojabakirgan  scheme  are  still  expected  to  make  significant \nlosses in the first year, and in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu in the first 2 years of the Project. However, the \nlarge farms in the Vakhsh scheme are expected to make a net profit of $29/ha on average. The \nfarm net income will gradually increase in all three schemes until year 9, when it will stabilize for \nthe  rest  of  the  project  period.  In  year  9,  an  average  large  farm  in  Khojabakirgan  scheme  will \nmake a net income of $260/ha; in Vakhsh scheme, $239/ha; and in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu, $186/ha. \n\n29. \nThe profitability of small dehkan farms is expected to be higher than that of larger farms. \nThe  net  incomes  of  small  farms  will  consistently  increase  until  year  9.  In  year  9,  an  average \ndehkan  farm  is  expected  to  make  a  net  income  of  $300/ha  in  Khojabakirgan,  $224/ha  in \nVakhsh,  and  $190/ha  in  Kyzylsu-Yakhsu  farms.  As  expected,  the  profitability  of  small  farms  is \nhigher  in  Khojabakirgan  and  Kyzylsu-Yakhsu. However, in Vakhsh, the profit /hectare of small \nfarms is lower because of preference to growing wheat for food security purposes. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n\ni\n\n \n\n4\n9\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n50 \n \n\nTable A9.2: Typical Farm Budget \nLarge (non-dehkan) Farm, 1,400 ha \n($) \n\nItem \n\nYear 1  \n\nYear 2   Year 3 \n\nYear 4 \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 6 \n\nYear 7 \n\nYear 8 \n\nYears 9-\n20 \n\nTotal Revenues \nTotal Costs \n\nNet Income \n\nNet Income/ha \n\n324,425 328,793 332,350 358,764 624,564 631,812 639,952 728,063 871,112\n\n328,547 328,748 329,054 350,634 401,817 402,803 404,496 455,295 507,210\n\n-4,122\n\n-3\n\n46\n\n0\n\n3,296\n\n8,130 222,747 229,009 235,456 272,767 363,903\n\n2\n\n6\n\n159\n\n164\n\n168\n\n195\n\n260\n\nTotal Revenues \n\n367,474 372,894 376,915 388,503 638,018 644,674 649,864 702,787 814,128\n\nTotal Costs \n\nNet Income \n\n326,781 326,992 327,400 334,152 420,504 421,195 420,968 452,551 480,043\n\n40,692\n\n45,901\n\n49,515\n\n54,351 217,515 223,479 228,896 250,235 334,085\n\nNet Income/ha \n\n29\n\n33\n\n35\n\n39\n\n155\n\n160\n\n163\n\n179\n\n239\n\nKhojabakirgan \n\nVakhsh \n\nKyzylsu-Yakhsu \n\nTotal Revenues \n\n229,483  233,839 235,797 238,744 427,219 430,873 431,978 505,247 616,908\n\nTotal Costs \n\nNet Income \n\nNet Income/ha \n\n234,409  234,585 234,902 235,087 283,645 283,959 283,673 330,570 356,497\n\n-4,925 \n\n-4 \n\n-746\n\n-1\n\n895\n\n1\n\n3,657 143,574 146,914 148,304 174,677 260,412\n\n3\n\n103\n\n105\n\n106\n\n125\n\n186\n\n  \n\nYear 1   Year 2   Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Year 6  Year 7  Year 8  Years 9-20\n\n \nTable A9.3: Typical Farm Budget \nDehkan Farm, 17 ha \n($) \n\nKhojabakirgan \n\n3,939 \n\n3,894 \n\n3,993\n\n3,896\n\n3,800 \n\n3,731 \n\n45 \n\n3 \n\n96\n\n6\n\n69 \n\n4 \n\n4,229 \n\n3,684 \n\n545 \n\n32 \n\n2,787 \n\n2,778 \n\n9 \n\n4,528\n\n3,872\n\n656\n\n39\n\n2,839\n\n2,780\n\n60\n\n4,577 \n\n3,872 \n\n705 \n\n41 \n\n2,863 \n\n2,784 \n\n79 \n\n5 \n\nVakhsh \n\n4,403\n\n4,284\n\n118\n\n7\n\n4,437\n\n3,748\n\n689\n\n41\n\n2,899\n\n2,785\n\n114\n\n7\n\n \n\nKyzylsu-Yakhsu \n\n7,962\n\n10,230 \n\n12,267\n\n7,700\n\n4,946\n\n2,754\n\n162\n\n7,288\n\n4,721\n\n2,567\n\n151\n\n5,188\n\n3,382\n\n1,806\n\n106\n\n7,805 \n\n4,972 \n\n2,832 \n\n167 \n\n7,355 \n\n4,728 \n\n2,627 \n\n155 \n\n5,232 \n\n3,385 \n\n1,847 \n\n109 \n\n5,038\n\n2,924\n\n172\n\n7,397\n\n4,726\n\n2,671\n\n157\n\n5,245\n\n3,382\n\n1,863\n\n110\n\n6,376 \n\n3,855 \n\n227 \n\n8,010 \n\n5,096 \n\n2,914 \n\n171 \n\n6,135 \n\n3,938 \n\n2,197 \n\n129 \n\n7,164\n\n5,103\n\n300\n\n9,255\n\n5,443\n\n3,812\n\n224\n\n7,491\n\n4,253\n\n3,238\n\n190\n\nTotal Revenues \n\nTotal Costs \n\nNet Income \n\nNet Income/ha \n\nTotal Revenues \n\nTotal Costs \n\nNet Income \n\nNet Income/ha \n\nTotal Revenues \n\nTotal Costs \n\nNet Income \n\nNet Income/ha \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates  \n\n1 \n\n4\n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  are \n\nfinalizing  a  poverty  partnership  agreement. \n\nSector  Identified  as  a  National  Priority  In  Country  Poverty  Analysis/Poverty  Partnership \nAgreement:  \n \nThe Government has set poverty reduction as its primary objective for sustainable development. \nIt has finalized its national poverty reduction strategy, which was endorsed by the Parliament on 24 June \n2002.  The  strategy  will  focus  on  (i)  accelerated,  socially  fair,  labor-intensive,  and  export-oriented \neconomic  growth;  (ii)  efficient  and  fair  provision  of  basic  social  services;  (iii)  targeted  support  to  the \npoorest groups of the population; and (iv) efficient governance and improvement in security. Agriculture \nsector  development  that  emphasizes  improving  productivity  and  creating  jobs  has  a  key  role  in  the \nstrategy\u2019s  pro-poor  growth  intervention.  The  high  priority  accorded  to  agriculture  sector  development  is \nwarranted  as  about  four-fifths  of  the  poor  population  reside  in  the  countryside  and  most  rural  residents \ndepend on farming as their main income and food source.  \n \nThe poverty reduction strategy likewise accords equal attention to addressing nonincome-based \npoverty.  Less  than  one-fourth  of  total  rural  households  have  piped  drinking  water;  many  obtain  their \nwater from open ditches, thus increasing their susceptibility to waterborne diseases. Only 2% of the rural \ncommunities are connected to sewerage systems. Thus, the poverty reduction strategy, having adopted \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals,  has  set  as  a  target  that,  by  2010,  80%  of  the  total  households  will \nhave access to safe water. \n \nImproving \nproductivity  and  facilitating  diversification  of  the  economic  structure  particularly  in  the  agriculture  sector \nhave been identified as major areas for poverty reduction in the short and medium terms. Another focal \narea is the provision of potable water especially in the rural areas. For both areas of intervention, targets \nwill be set and monitored periodically to ensure their significant impact on  poverty. \n \nContribution of the Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty in Tajikistan: \n \nTajikistan  is  predominantly  an  agriculture  economy  as  the  sector  contributes  20%  of  gross \ndomestic  product,  30%  of  export  revenues,  and  more  than  half  of  total  employment.  Almost 80% of the \ntotal arable land is irrigated.  \n \nThere  are  at  least  two  ways  that  agriculture  development  will  make  significant  inroads  in \ncombating  poverty  in  the  country.  First,  improved  productivity  and  more  efficient  irrigation  systems  will \ntranslate to higher outputs and increased incomes of the rural poor. At present, about three-fifths of the \npopulation  live  in  rural  areas  and  rely  primarily  on  production  of  their  irrigated  garden  plots  (averaging \n0.1-0.2 hectare [ha]/household) as their main source of food and some cash income. These subsistence \nplots,  together  with  the  small-sized  private-owned  (dehkan)  farms  contribute  about  40%  of  total \nagriculture production. \n \nHowever,  total  production  and  productivity  in  all  farms  have  been  low.  Total  output  of  the \nagriculture sector on average is just 55% of the 1991 output level and the yield in 2000 was 44% of the \n1991  yield  level.  For  the  poor  who  subsist  mainly  on  their  small  garden  plots,  lack  of  irrigation  and \naccess to new farm practices have limited their cropping intensity to the spring months, thus preventing \nthem from additional cash income during the winter season. Moreover, because of the poor performance \nof  the  agriculture  sector,  wage  laborers  in  the  sector,  who  are  also  poor,  suffer.  Their  wages  have \ndeteriorated in real terms; and payments of their salaries have frequently been delayed. In 2001, arrears \nin the agriculture sector were highest across sectors at TJS11.0 million. \n \nThe  second  contribution  of  the  sector  to  reducing  poverty  is  by  creating jobs. At least 30% of \nrural households are unemployed. Moreover, because of the civil strife, 18% of the total households are \nfemale-headed.  With  the  limited  creation  of  formal  sector  employment,  overseas  work  and  jobs  in  the \ninformal sector are the next best alternative. Improved productivity in agriculture that expands labor use \nand  diversify  crop  use  will  be  more  economically  and  socially  sustainable.  More  jobs  and  increasing \nincomes  in  the  agriculture  sector  spur  rural  industries  that  in  turn,  form  the  base  for  rural \nindustrialization;  in-country  (as  opposed  to  overseas)  employment  reduces  the  potentials  for  family  and \ncultural breakdowns. \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n5\n1\n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nPoverty Analysis:  Proposed Classification - Core Poverty Intervention \n\nIncreased  and  improved  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  better  sanitation  practices  will \n \ncontribute  significantly  to  addressing  non-income  poverty.  Infectious  and  parasitic  diseases  (especially \nthose that are waterborne) are the second leading causes of deaths in the country and disproportionally \naffect  the  poor.  Provision  of  safe  drinking  water  and  education  on  good  sanitation  practices  focus  on \nimproving the health conditions of the poor and vulnerable groups and lessening the burden for women \nand children in fetching water. \n \nB. \n \nIn  the  project  areas  in  Khatlon  and  Sughd,  the  poverty  incidence  is  higher  than  the  national \n \naverage  of  83%.  About  89%  of  the  rural  populace  in  Khatlon  region  and  87%  in  Sughd  region  are \nconsidered  poor,  with  average  monthly  spending  of  below  TJS20/family/month.  In  the project area, the \nincidence of poverty is estimated at 88%. Among these poor, about 45% are considered very poor with \nexpenditures  of  TJS10-20/family/month.  The  Project  is  expected  to  increase  the  incomes  of  this  group \nso that their spending will be more  than  TJS20/month  and  thus  they  will  be  pulled  out  of  poverty.  The \nremaining 43% are extremely poor. with expenditures less than TJS10/family/month. Income sources of \nthe rural populace are partly from farm wages (16% of their total income) but most rely on farming both \nfor subsistence and for sale (63%); a few households received remittances from their close kin working \noutside  the  region  or  augment  their  household  income  through  occasional  public  works  activities  and \ncotton harvesting. Women and children from poor households are employed on a voluntary basis during \nthe cotton harvesting season. The poor especially in Khatlon depend mainly on their household crops for \ntheir  food,  with  hardly  any  marketable  surplus  left.  Most  of  the  rural  populace  in  these  regions employ \ncoping  strategies  for  survival  such  as  shifting  to  cheaper  food  stuffs,  decreasing  the  number  of  daily \nmeals,  and  decreasing  the  amount  of  food  consumed.  These  have  led  to  declines  in  per  capita  daily \ncaloric  intake  and  inadequate  family  nutrition.  Other  coping  strategies  include  the  selling  of  assets, \nborrowing,  and  migrating  to  other  regions  and  outside  the  country  for  work.  Partly  because  of  the  war \nand  due  to  out-migration  in  search  of  jobs,  as  many  as  25,000  families,  most  of  whom  are  found in the \nKhatlon  region,  have  female  heads  who  have  to  cope  with  rearing  their  children  and  of  finding  income \nand food for the family. \n \nLack  of  income-  and  job-creating activities in the countryside, and the declining productivity of \nthe  arable  lands  are  the  principal  causes  of  the  income-based  poverty.  Official  unemployment  in  the \nproject  areas  is  11-18%  although  unofficial  estimates  peg  the  unemployment  rates  at  30%.  Moreover, \nthe  deterioration  of  irrigation  facilities  combined  with  poor  farming  practices  (e.g.,  limited  use  of  high \nquality  seeds,  fertilizers,  chemicals,  and  farm  machinery)  has  resulted  in  decreasing  yields  of  major \ncrops (cotton and wheat), and in lower cropping intensities. Cotton yields in the project areas are 0.7-1.8 \nt/ha while wheat yields are 0.8-2.0 t/ha; both are less than half the 1990 levels. As a consequence, many \nof  the  farm  workers  in  the  large  farm  enterprises  have  declining  wages  and  delayed  payments.  For  the \npoor who subsist mainly on their small garden plots, lack of irrigation and access to new farm practices \nhave  limited  their  cropping  intensity  to  the  spring  months,  thus  preventing  them  from  generating \nadditional  cash  income  during  the  winter  season.  Low  incomes  induced  a  shift  to  consumption  of \ncheaper  foodstuffs  and  lower intake of protein, vitamins, and micronutrients, resulting into stunting and \nwasting problems among children and anemia among pregnant and lactating mothers.  \n \nPoverty  in  the  project  areas  is  also  nonincome  based.  Limited  access  to  potable  water  topped \nthe list of concerns among the households in the project areas. The poor in the project areas have the \nleast access to potable water; and are more susceptible to waterborne diseases. In Khojabakirgan, only \nabout  25%  of  people  have  access  to  water  supply  and  more  than  50%  obtain  their  water  from  open \nditches, 33% from water pipes, and less than 5% buy water from tanker trucks. In the Khatlon region, the \nsituation  is  more  severe  as  less  than  20%  have  access  to  water  supply  and  more  than  75%  of  the \npopulation obtain their water from open ditches such as irrigation canals. Some people walk as far as 10 \nkilometers  to  collect  water  for  domestic  use;  in  Kyzylsu-Yakhsu, queuing for water takes as much as 6 \nhours.  In  all  these  areas,  many  of  the  water  fetchers  are  children  and  women.  Because  of  the  poor \nquality  of  potable  water,  and  lack  of  knowledge  of  good  sanitation  practices,  a  large  proportion  of  the \nproject\u2019s  population  suffers  from  waterborne  diseases.  All  of  the  targeted  districts  have  incidence  rates \nof typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, and malaria ranging from 130% to 230% of the national average. \n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared \n\nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  and \n \nthe  target  clientele  and  the  issues  to  be  addressed  was  verified  with  a  small  sample  of  stakeholders \nduring  the  preappraisal  mission.  In  both  stages,  an  iterative  process  using  (i)  quantitative  (sample \nsurveys  at  village  levels)  and  qualitative  (focused  group  discussions,  stakeholder  workshop,  and \nconsultation  meetings  and  dialogues)  approaches,  and  (ii)  secondary  and  primary  information  was \nemployed to ensure that the issues and needs of the poor and vulnerable groups are properly identified; \nthat  the  poor  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  the  investment  Project  in  a  sustainable  manner;  that \ngender,  environment,  and  other  social  issues  are  tackled;  and  that  the  prospective  beneficiaries  will  be \nactively  involved  in  implementing  and  monitoring  the  Project.  Also,  three  of  the  five  criteria  for  the \nselection of the investment project schemes were pro-poor focused (i) broad geographical coverage but \nwith emphasis on the poorer districts, (ii) absence of safe drinking water source, and (iii) the willingness \nof local communities to participate.  \n \nThe  project  areas  cover  26  villages  with  a  total  rural  population  of  471,500,  the  primary \nbeneficiaries  of  the  proposed  Project.  Of  total  beneficiaries,  45%  are  poor  (those  with  spending \nTJS10-TJS20/month), 40% are very poor (spending  of  TJS4-TJS10/month), and 3% are extremely poor \nwith spending less than TJS4/month. The main vulnerable groups are (i) households with more than five \nchildren,  (ii)  single-headed  families  especially  those  headed  by  women,  (iii)  families  with  inadequate \nnon-agriculture  employment,  (iv)  the  elderly,  and  (v)  members  of  dehkan  collective  farms  producing \ncotton.  Most  households  have  small  garden  plots  that  provide  their  main  source  of  income  and  food;  a \nfew own livestock for additional food and income. Food is their largest expenditure. When asked during \nthe group discussion what their priority needs are, the following were mentioned often: (i) lack of drinking \nwater  facilities,  (ii)  poor  condition  of  irrigation  facilities;  (iii)  lack  of  jobs;  (iv)  high  rates  of  infectious \ndiseases;  and  (v)  lack  of  access  to  agriculture  inputs  (fertilizers  and  seeds),  farm  equipment,  and \nupdated  farming  practices.  Women  play  multiple  roles  at  the  household  level,  and  as  a  consequence, \ncannot  fully  participate  in  or  have  equal  access  to  information  and  technology,  and  land  tenure  rights. \nWith  project  implementation,  intensive  farming  will  ensue  in  the  garden,  dehkan,  and  other  farm  types, \nresulting  in  increased  work  hours  for  women.  In  general,  women  farmers  consider  this  a  plus  factor \nbecause of the low incomes and job opportunities in the project areas.  \n\n \n\nParticipation Strategy \n \nTo  help  ensure  that  the  poverty  reduction  outcomes  envisaged  by  the  Project  are  realized,  a \n \nparticipatory  plan  will  be  developed  and  incorporated  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  social \nimpact and in the creation of the community-based groups. The objective of the plan is to ensure that the \nbeneficiaries of the project components, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups, are involved in the \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  components  and  in  the  establishment  and  operations  of  the \ncommunity-based  groups.  Special  attention  will  be  accorded  to  the  involvement  of  female-headed  farm \nhouseholds  and  agriculture  women  in  the  project  areas  who  will  benefit  from  construction  of  irrigation \nand  drainage  facilities  and  the  rehabilitation  of  potable  water  supply  systems  and  the  health  education \ntrainings.  Various  participatory  approaches  will  be  employed  in  facilitating  the  involvement  of  other \nconcerned  parties  such  as  the  central  and  local  agencies  and  governments,  nongovernmental \norganizations, private sector, and other members of civil society. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n5\n3\n\n \n\n\fStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nEqual representation of female-\nheaded households who are \nlikewise farmers in the farmers\u2019 \ngroups and water users\u2019 groups and \nwater users\u2019 associations (WUAs) \n\nOutput \nPrepared \n\nNone \nGender analysis \nand plan \n\n54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nD. \n\nPotential Issues \n\nIssue \n\nResettlement \nGender \n\nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \n\nNone \n\u2022  Significant as \nintensive cultivation \nwill increase the \ninvolvement of the \nwomen in the \nhousehold plots and \nduring cotton \nharvesting season. \n\u2022  Need to ensure that \nwomen have a major \nsay in the identification \nand selection of \npotable water facilities. \nNot significant to \nsignificant if proper \nconsultation among \nwater users in the \ndetermination of water \ncharges and the \nresponsibilities on \noperation and \nmaintenance (O&M) \nare not done. \n\nAffordability \n\n\u2022  Development of strong WUAs and \nfarmers\u2019 groups \n\u2022  Regular dialogues with local \nrepresentatives of the Ministry of \nWater Resources and Land \nReclamation (MWRLR) \n\u2022  Capacity training for water user\u2019s \nand farmers\u2019 groups \n\nLabor \n\nThe extremely poor will be given \npriority in public works jobs. \n\nNot significant but \nneed to ensure that \nwork opportunities for \nthe very and extremely \npoor are addressed. \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \nOther  Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNone \n\nNot significant \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  Participatory \nplan in the \npromotion, \nformation, and \ntraining of WUAs \nand farmers\u2019 \ngroups as well as \nthe local and \ncentral MWRLR to \nensure that the cost \nof water per \nbeneficiary is \naffordable and \nO&M \nresponsibilities are \nclearly determined \nto ensure sustained \nuse of the facilities. \n\u2022  Monitoring and \nevaluation unit to \nbe established in \nthe project \nmanagement office \n(PMO). \nIdentification and \nselection of casual \nwork in the public \nworks activities will \nensure hiring of \nvery to extremely \npoor in the project \nareas. \nNone \n\nNone \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n55 \n\nGender Analysis and Plan \n\n1. \nGender  Status  and  Issues.     The  women  in  Tajikistan  bore  the  brunt  of  the  combined  adverse \nimpact  of  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  the  5-year  civil  conflict,  which  ensued \nimmediately  after  independence.  The  economic  and  social  difficulties  during  the  transition  years  have \nconstrained  economic  activity  and,  in  turn,  intensified  women\u2019s  workload  and  participation  in  both  the \ninformal  sector  and  low-paying  formal  labor  market.  Women\u2019s  limited  access  to  productive  and \nremunerative  resources  has  constrained  their  economic  opportunities,  and  especially  for  rural  women, \nhas  confined  them  to  just  the  coping  strategies  for  survival.  Partly  because  of  the  war  and  due  to  out-\nmigration in search of jobs, as many as 25,000 families, the majority of them in the Khatlon region, have \nfemale  heads  who  have  to  cope  with  rearing  their  children  and  finding  income  and  food  for  the  family. \nThus, to make ends meet, rural women play multiple roles. They farm intensively their garden plots, which \nprovide  the  main  food  and  income  source  for  their  families.  If  they  have  some  savings,  the  women  buy \nsome  livestock  and  take  care  of  these  animals.  They  are  also  responsible  for  marketing  any  surplus  in \ntheir  produce  as  well  as  planning  and  executing  the  household  budget.  Rural  women  are  the  bulk  of  the \nworkforce during cotton and wheat harvesting. They are also responsible for taking care of the elderly and \ndisabled.  \n \n2. \nThe women were adversely affected by the collapse of the social safety nets and social protection \nmeasures.  Much  of  these  roles  were  left  to  the  women  to  assume  in  their  homes,  which  effectively \nreduced  their  participation  in  social  and  political  groups  at  the  community  and  national  levels.  With  the \nclosures  of  nurseries,  mothers  took  over  the  care  of  their  young  children.  Net  enrolment  of  girls  to  boys \nalso  declined  dramatically,  especially  at  the  7-18  year  age  brackets. Taking care of the elderly and the \ndisabled  became  roles  of  the  women.  Deteriorating  health  status  among  women  and  children  worsened \nwith  the  decline  in  health  care  services  and  reduction  of  municipal  infrastructure,  particularly  potable \ndrinking water. Aside from being vulnerable to waterborne diseases, women and children have the added \nburden  of  fetching  drinking  water  from  open  ditches,  canals,  and  river  streams;  often  times,  they  walk  a \nfar distance to obtain water. \n  \nGender  Strategy  and  Plan.  The  overall  gender  strategy  is  to  lessen  the  economic  and  social \n3. \nburden  of  rural  women  in  the  project  areas  by  (i)  identifying  the  project  interventions  that  will  increase \ntheir  access  to  food  and  income  for  their  households  as  well  as  address  their  and  their  household \nmembers\u2019  vulnerability  to  waterborne  diseases,  and  (ii)  empower  them  to  actively  participate  in \ncommunity groups. \n \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n5\n5\n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nAgriculture support \nservices for dehkan farms \n\n4. \n\nComponents and Targets for Gender Strategy \n\nProject Component \n\nFeatures \n\nApproach/Target \n\n\u2022  Female farmers will have \naccess to training in new \ncultural practices in soil \nfertility, crop husbandry, and \nadvice on new farm \npractices. \n\u2022  Ensure that agriculture \ninputs (seeds and fertilizers) \nwill not be harmful to farm \nworkers. \n\u2022  Ensure that farm \nmachinery will reduce \nlaborious workload of \nwomen. \n\u2022  Increase membership of \nwomen in farmers\u2019 groups. \nWomen\u2019s participation in \nWUAs \n\nWomen participation in \nidentification and selection of \nareas for potable water \nsupply systems. \n\n\u2022  Women farmer\u2019s participation in \nfarmers\u2019 groups will be no less than 30%. \n\u2022  Female-headed farm will have priority \nto training for new farm practices, inputs, \nand technical advice. \n\u2022  Agriculture Academy of Sciences will \nensure the development of farm \nmachinery, agriculture inputs, and farm \npractices that will not unduly burden rural \nwomen and children. \n\nFemale-headed farm in project areas will \nbe members of WUAs  \n\n\u2022  Community groups should have at \nleast 40% women participants in the \nidentification and selection of areas for \npotable water supply facilities. \n\u2022  At least 20% women will be involved in \nWater and Sanitary Councils that will \ndetermine the O&M of the water facilities. \n\u2022  Training and capacity building for rural \nwomen in sanitation practices and water \nusers\u2019 rights and obligations. \n\u2022  Monitoring and evaluation units will \ngive equal opportunities to women staff. \n\u2022 \n Monitoring and evaluation units will \nfacilitate development of women\u2019s groups \nthat monitor and evaluate the \nperformance of project activities and \nexpected outputs. \n\nRehabilitation of irrigation \nand drainage systems and \nrelated institutional support \nImprovement of potable \nwater supply system \n\nProject Management \nOffice \n\nMonitoring and performance \nindicators will take into \naccount women\u2019s concerns. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nTJS1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Somoni (TJS) \n$0.339 \nTJS2.953 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nEIRR \nFMU \nha \nI&D \nm \nM&E \nMOA \nMWRLR \nO&M \nPIU \nPMO \nt \nTA \nTUGE \nUS \nWSC \nWUA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \neconomic internal rate of return \nfarm machinery unit \nhectare \nirrigation and drainage \nmeter \nmonitoring and evaluation \nMinistry of Agriculture \nMinistry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementation unit \nproject management office \nton (metric) \ntechnical assistance \nTajik Universal Goods and Raw Materials Exchange \nUnited States of America \nwater and sanitation council \nwater users\u2019 association \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of: M.
