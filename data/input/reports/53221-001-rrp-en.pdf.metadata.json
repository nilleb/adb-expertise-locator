The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nSupporting  the  Third  Capital  Market  Development  Program,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2. \n The proposed program will support demand- and supply-side measures to broaden and \ndeepen the financial system in Pakistan and ground it in a strong legal and regulatory framework \nin  line  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy,  2015\u20132019  and \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Pakistan.2 It also fits in  the framework of the \n$6 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program approved on \n3  July  2019  to  facilitate  improved  macroeconomic  management.3 The  EFF  program  includes \nrecommendations relating to finance sector reforms that focus on deepening access to finance, \nimplementing a sound debt management strategy, and supporting private sector development. \nThe  proposed  program  contributes  to  EFF  implementation  and  sustainability  since  it  develops \nalternative sources of access to finance (i.e., capital markets), supports sound debt management \nthrough  government  bond  market  development,  and  facilitates  private  sector  investment  by \nmobilizing  financial  resources.  The  program,  structured  as  two  subprograms,  will  facilitate  the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  necessary  reforms  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for \ncompetitive  capital  markets.  The  programmatic  approach  will  chronologically  sequence  the \nreforms in a multiyear framework (2019\u20132022) and provide for flexibility to incorporate changes \nwhere warranted. Even with the country\u2019s evolving economic situation, the  program\u2019s design is \nrobust because of its emphasis on the capital market enabling environment. Programmatic budget \nsupport  will  finance  two  subprograms,  each  designated  as  a  fully  front-loaded,  single-tranche \nintervention to be implemented during 2019\u20132022. The attached TA will assist in implementing \nthe program. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nA central objective of the government\u2019s economic development strategy, as reflected in \nVision  2025,4 is  to  elevate  Pakistan\u2019s  status  from  a  lower  middle-income  country  to  an  upper \nmiddle-income one by 2025. The  government has targeted the  generation of job opportunities \nand enhanced income levels as top priorities. Achieving the objective of Vision 2025 will require \nsubstantial private and public investments to accelerate economic growth. Economic growth has \nbeen largely driven by public and private consumption, with very low levels of domestic savings \nand investment. At 15% of gross domestic product (GDP), Pakistan\u2019s investment rate in 2020 is \nalmost half of the South Asian average of 30% of GDP. Crowding out of private investment also \noccurs  because  of  excessive  government  borrowing  from  banks  to  finance  the  deficit.

Similarly, the domestic savings rate declined from 17.4% of \nGDP in 1990 to 5.2% of GDP in 2020; this is significantly lower than the rate of its regional peers \nin 2020: 28.0% in India, 25.0% in Bangladesh%, and 21.0% in Sri Lanka.5 Underdeveloped capital \nmarkets have contributed  to  the  ineffective  mobilization  of  savings.  Consequently,  the  savings \ngap has  led  to  a persistently high  fiscal deficit  that  makes  the  economy  dependent  on volatile \nforeign capital. \n \nPakistan\u2019s vulnerability may increase as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) decelerated \n4. \neconomic growth to \u20130.38% in fiscal year (FY) 20206 and inflows from exports and remittances \nwere adversely impacted. Market capitalization as a percentage of GDP  at the Pakistan Stock \nExchange (PSX) declined from 16% of GDP on 1 March 2020 to 15% as of mid-August 2020. A \nsteeper decline at the PSX has been prevented by a series of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) policy \nrate cuts since mid-March 2020 that lowered the policy rate by 6.25% to 7.00% and the borrowing \ncosts for firms. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s access to global financial markets has become more \nexpensive because of an increase in the credit default spread since February 2020.7 As a result, \ndeveloping  robust  and  competitive  domestic  capital  markets  is  even  more  critical  and  is  an \nindispensable  tool  for  mobilizing private  investment  and  minimizing  such  external shocks.  The \nprogram will aid the COVID-19 recovery phase through subprogram 1 reforms, such as enhanced \naccess to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through a dedicated capital \nmarket platform and mobilization of savings by onboarding new retail investors through simplified \nknow-your-customer (KYC) procedures with biometric verification. The government has become \nincreasingly aware of the need to institute appropriate reforms so that the capital markets can \nenhance intermediate savings and investments to drive sustainable economic growth. \n \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  prioritizes  developing  the  finance  sector  and  capital  markets  to \n5. \nsupport  sustainable  economic  development  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  private \ninvestment.8 The program will not only support private sector expansion but also contribute to the \noperational priorities of (i) strengthening governance and institutional capacity through specific \ninstitutional  strengthening  reforms  and  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  through \nreforms that enhance the participation of female investors. Facilitation of private sector investment \nwas part of the country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 and is also a key area under the country \npartnership strategy, 2020\u20132024 (footnote 2). \n \nPredominantly bank-based finance sector.9 Pakistan\u2019s finance sector is predominantly \n6. \na bank-based system that does not effectively play its intermediation role. As of April 2020, bank \nassets  accounted  for  almost  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  financial  assets,  national  saving \ninstruments and government bonds accounted for 25% of total financial assets, and the equity \nmarket  contributed  less  than  5%.  In  comparison,  bank  assets  accounted  for  62%  of  GDP  in \nBangladesh, 81% in India, and 70% in Sri Lanka, while equity market assets accounted for 12% \nof GDP in Bangladesh, 14% in India, and 22% in Sri Lanka. Banks in Pakistan mainly offer short \nmaturity  loans  and  are  not  in  a  strong  prudential  position  to  offer  long-term  financing  for \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n\n \n\n5  World  Bank.

Pakistan\u2019s  capital  markets  play  a  limited  role  in \n7. \nfinancial intermediation and resource mobilization. The PSX lacks depth in terms of the number \nof investors and the number of companies raising capital. Fewer than 250,000 individual investors \n(less than 0.1% of the population) have a stock investing account. The absence of a centralized \nKYC procedure and cumbersome customer onboarding requirements impede the participation of \nnew investors in the capital markets. During 2015\u20132019, only 25 companies raised capital at the \nPSX, while private equity and venture capital capital-raising activity was four times higher. Market \ncapitalization of the PSX accounted for only about 13% of the country\u2019s GDP in mid-April 2020, \nregressing  from  30%  of  GDP  in  May  2017.  With  543  listed  companies  and  $42 billion  market \ncapitalization, the PSX is below most of its regional peers in terms of market capitalization as a \npercentage  of  GDP  (12%  in  Bangladesh,  21%  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  41%  in  India)  in  2020.  On \naverage,  2.7  brokerage  firms  have  defaulted  per  year  since  2000,  which  adversely  impacted \nmarket confidence. Rules to be listed on the PSX main board and the SME board, which was \ncreated to encourage start-ups, are restrictive. In addition, the SME board requires companies to \nhave a 5-year history and be profitable for more than 2 years. As a result, no company has listed \non the PSX\u2019s SME board despite the country\u2019s growing technology start-up ecosystem. The depth \nand breadth of the capital markets have also been restricted since many state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs) have not been listed on the PSX. As a result, SOEs also miss out on the benefits from \nefficiency  improvements  through  the  discipline  of  stock  market  listing.  Sophisticated  products \nsuch as options and derivatives are not available in the capital markets. \n \n8. \nConstrained bond  market  development.  Pakistan\u2019s  bond  market  (34%  of  GDP as  of \nApril  2020)  is  almost  completely  dominated  by  government  borrowing.  The  government  bond \nmarket is primarily short dated with an average debt maturity of 1.7 years. It does not fulfill its role \nas a benchmark pricing reference  because of ad hoc government debt management practices \narising  from  the  absence  of  a  professional  debt  management  office  (DMO).  The  operating \nframework  of  the  government  bond  market  system  does  not  promote  competitive  bidding. \nAuctioning of government securities is not based on market prices and hampers the formulation \nof a credible government yield curve and a liquid bond market. Although auctions are conducted \nbased on a preannounced auction calendar, the government decides the cut-off yield for the debt \nrather  than  accepting a  market-determined  yield  for  the announced  volume.  When  the  market \nasks for a price higher than what the government is willing to offer, the bids are frequently rejected. \nThe price-driven approach has deep implications for Pakistan\u2019s capital markets. It has restricted \nthe  volume  and  liquidity  of  longer-tenor government  bonds,  and yields  do  not  then  reflect  true \nmarket conditions, which hinders the process of establishing a credible benchmark for medium- \nto long-term financing rates. This undermines the credibility of the primary market, as does the \nrejection  of  auction  bids.  The  government  bond  market  also  does  not  offer  sovereign  sukuks \n(Islamic bonds) to cater to the liquidity management requirements of Islamic banks. \n \n9. \nThe nascent corporate bond market accounted for 2.2% of GDP as of April 2020 compared \nwith 1.0% in Bangladesh, 1.0% in Sri Lanka, and 16.0% in India. The absence of an effective \ngovernment  bond  market yield curve  impedes  the  appropriate  pricing  of corporate  bonds,  and \ncorporate bond issuances are therefore less attractive to issuers and investors. Tax distortions, \nsuch  as  a  complex  and  uneven  tax  regime  that  disadvantages  nonresident  companies  from \ninvesting in bonds, hinder bond market activity. On the demand side, major institutional investors \n(such as pension funds and insurance companies) have a limited role in financing government \nbonds and corporate bonds since these investors prefer National Savings Scheme instruments.10 \n\n10 National Savings Scheme instruments, administered by the Central Directorate of National Savings, are attractive \nsince these instruments are government backed and offer higher returns than equivalent money market instruments, \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fThe  participation  of  investors  across  the  maturity  spectrum  is  critical  to  support  market \ndevelopment. A diverse investor base also lowers the debt cost and volatility in market yields. \n \n10. \nLimited  coordination  between  the  regulators.  Reform  opportunities  begin  with  the \nregulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the SBP, and the DMO \nat the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The SECP acts as the company registrar and apex regulator \nfor nonbank financial markets, including capital markets.  The SBP, the central bank, regulates \nthe banking industry. The DMO handles debt management at the MOF. A national strategic plan \nfor  capital  market  development  is  absent  and  an  institutionalized  forum  for  key  agencies  to \ncoordinate their efforts does not exist. Financial stability is compromised because of limited policy \ncoordination  and  joint  supervision  of  the  financial  system  by  the  key  regulators.  Gaps  persist \nbetween regulators and risks may build across the financial system with no overarching oversight. \n \n11. \nPersistent weakness in governance structures. The SECP\u2019s operational and financial \nefficiency is constrained in terms of the  unclear appointment process, siloed operations where \ncommissioners are responsible only for their designated areas rather than acting as a collegiate \nbody, and limited clarity in the policy board\u2019s role. The SECP\u2019s market surveillance system needs \nto  be  upgraded  to  ensure  effective  market  monitoring.  Its  enforcement  effectiveness  is  also \nchallenged by the absence of a dedicated capital market tribunal. The court system does not have \nthe  competence  to  deliberate  on  securities  cases,  and  the  pace  of  resolving  securities  cases \npending in the court system is also slow. \n \n12. \nSimilarly, the DMO under the MOF faces structural capacity issues and does not function \nas  a  properly  empowered  treasury  operation  that  develops  and  implements  a  consolidated \nadministrative framework for debt management. The DMO merely collates information and acts \nas a conduit to government securities auctions. All decisions on terms, tenor, and structure of \ndebt  are  made  on  a  fragmented  basis  across  the  MOF.  The  DMO  also  does  not  possess  a \ncentralized database for effective cash management and planning. This exposes the government \nto a risk of default in the case of any volatility in demand in the auctions for government bonds.11 \n \n13. \nIn  addition,  the  ability  of  the  country\u2019s  Audit  Oversight  Board  (AOB),  which  critically \noversees  audit  firm  quality  in  Pakistan  and  therefore  contributes  to  market  transparency,  to \neffectively  regulate  the  auditing  profession  is  constrained  in  terms  of  its  board  composition \neligibility criteria, its regulatory powers, and having a stable funding source. The AOB has weak \neligibility criteria for former audit practitioners to serve as members of the AOB governing body, it \nlacks a legal mandate to conduct direct inspections of audit firms unconditionally, and it lacks a \nstable  source  of  funding  from  the  government  to  effectively  execute  its  powers  and \nresponsibilities. Shareholders and investors rely on audited financial statements of companies to \nmake  informed  decisions  and  therefore  trust  that  only  an  audit  firm  with  a  satisfactory  quality \nrating can review companies\u2019 financial statements.  \n \n14. \nProgram anchor. To address these constraints, the government and ADB have agreed \nto  anchor  the  program  to  the  design  of  a  long-term  national  capital  market  master  plan.  The \n\n \n\nand can be redeemed any time without redemption charges, whereas selling instruments with comparable yields \ninvolve such charges. \n\n11 The  World Bank is focusing on organizational restructuring at  the MOF, including integration of various functions \nand/or responsibilities from the other MOF wings into the DMO as well as the DMO\u2019s debt reporting under the $500 \nmillion  Resilient  Institutions  for  Sustainable  Economy  (RISE)  Program  development  policy  financing  that  was \napproved  in  June  2020.  This  program  builds  on  those  foundations  by  developing  the  government  bond  market \nthrough the realization of a market-based government bond market yield curve based on a strategy of creating liquid \nbenchmark bond issues. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nformulation of this master plan during 2019\u20132020 is supported by subprogram 1. Approval of the \ncapital market master plan is included as a crucial subprogram 1 policy action under the program \nto build strong government ownership and coordination across the agencies. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nADB  has  been  engaging  with  Pakistan  since  the  1990s  and  has  been  the  lead \ndevelopment  partner  in  the  capital  markets  area.  ADB  has  supported  the  development  of \nPakistan\u2019s financial markets through three initiatives over the past two decades.  From 1997 to \n2002, support was mainly provided through a $250 million policy-based loan for the Capital Market \nDevelopment Program to support the adoption of fundamental reforms.12 This program primarily \ncontributed to the establishment of the SECP and the transition to a new regulatory regime. From \n2002 to 2007, support was provided through a $260 million policy-based loan for the Financial \n(Nonbank)  Markets  and  Governance  Program.13 The  objective  was  to  strengthen  the  pension, \ninsurance,  and  savings  systems,  as  well  as  strengthen  the  SECP\u2019s  regulatory  regime  in  the \nnonbank  subsector.  From  2007  to  2011,  a  $400  million  policy-based  loan  for  the  Second \nGeneration  of  Capital  Market  Reform  Program  primarily  supported  developing  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  voluntary  private  pensions,  adopting  a  professional  certification  regime,  and \nimplementing  a self-regulatory  organization  model  at  the  stock exchanges.14 Since 2011,  ADB \nhas  continued  engagement  in  the  finance  sector  through  a  public  sector  enterprises  reform \nprogram;  the  development  of  inclusive  insurance  markets  in  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises; and disaster risk financing.15 \n \n16. \nThe Capital Market Development Program was successfully implemented with concrete \nresults;  subsequent  financial  markets program  and  the  second  generation  program  mentioned \nabove were partly successful. The proposed program will build on lessons from the Independent \nEvaluation Department\u2019s special evaluation study and the completion reports of the three previous \nprograms. The program\u2019s effectiveness will be facilitated by (i) a limited number of impactful policy \nactions to monitor program compliance effectively (previous programs had too many actions and \ntoo broad a focus); (ii) comprehensive consultation with stakeholders through national workshops \nto diagnose the issues effectively, leading to adoption of relevant policies and thereby creating \nownership;16 and (iii) formulation of the long-term national capital market master plan to ensure \nsustainability  of  reforms,  and  embed  the  plan  within  a  broader  government-owned  long-term \ndevelopment strategy, serving as an anchor for the program.17 The program (i) pursues a focused \n\n \n\n12 ADB. 1997.

Program Completion Report on the Capital Market Development Program \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fapproach by concentrating on a few key areas, (ii) is part of a long-term engagement, and (iii) is \nintegrated with government reform initiatives supported by all relevant stakeholders (footnote 16). \n \n17. \nThe program builds on ADB\u2019s previous capital and financial market programs to introduce \nreform  measures  that  deepen  and  broaden  Pakistan\u2019s  capital  markets  by  (i)  developing  the \ngovernment yield curve and thereby promoting a more liquid government bond market through \nthe  institutional  strengthening  of  the  DMO;  (ii)  enhancing  institutional  investor  demand  by \nbroadening, deepening, and diversifying the investor base; (iii) strengthening the institutional and \nregulatory  capacity  of  the  SECP,  the  DMO,  and  the  AOB;  (iv)  developing  important  market \ninfrastructure, such as surveillance systems and a trading system for bonds; and (v) enhancing \nthe  supply  of  alternative  financial  instruments,  such  as  derivatives.  Government  consultations \nidentified the reform areas discussed in paras. 18\u201320. The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  Market  stability  strengthened.  The  reforms  will  promote  more  robust,  resilient,  and \nstable  capital  markets  through  subprogram  1  actions,  such  as  amending  the  Securities  and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan Act, 1997 to ensure structural changes in the appointment \nprocess, and commissioning operations as a collegiate body. The establishment of the National \nFinance Stability Council comprising the SBP governor, the SECP chair, and the finance minister \n(or  adviser  on  finance  and  revenue)    will  improve  interagency  policy  coordination  and  play  an \ninstrumental  role  in  dealing  with  systemic  issues  that  cut  across  regulatory  domains.  The \nintroduction  of  a  new  broker  model  will  strengthen  the  brokerage  industry  by  reducing  broker \ndefaults.  The  new  model  will  categorize  brokers  according  to  their  net  worth  and  governance \nrequirements, which will ascertain appropriate operational risks to be assumed by the brokers. \nSubprogram 2 actions include exempting income tax for SECP, implementing the broker model \nand replacing legacy leverage instruments with derivatives. \n \n19.  Market facilitation enhanced. Reforms in this area will support more efficient resource \nmobilization and allocation in the economy by expediting the adjudication of enforcement actions \nand  strengthening  auditing  standards.  Expedited  adjudication  will  complement  the  enhanced \nenforcement  capacity  at  the SECP by  establishing  a  special  tribunal  for  capital-market-related \ncases in subprogram 1 as part of the judicial system overseen by a tribunal chair and its members. \nSubprogram  1  actions  include  developing  an  adequately  funded  AOB  with  a  strengthened \nregulatory and operational mandate based on the adoption of international auditing standards, \nwhich will strengthen compliance, enhance market confidence, and allow for informed investment \ndecisions. The formulation of a long-term national capital market master plan will ensure that the \nprogram is an integral part of a government-owned long-term development strategy. Subprogram \n2 actions include making the special tribunal operational and installing an upgraded electronic \nmarket surveillance system at the SECP. \n \n20. \nThe supply and demand of securities enhanced. This will involve supply measures in \nsubprogram 1 to (i) promote alternative financial instruments through in-principle approval from \nthe federal government for passage by Parliament of a netting bill to be implemented by the SECP \nand  SBP  that  will  reduce  counterparty  risk  and  the  subsequent  introduction  of  derivatives  to \ndevelop a deeper and broader capital market, (ii) revitalize a separate PSX board for SMEs with \nreduced listing requirements and costs, and (iii) gain Cabinet approval for a streamlined taxation \nregime for nonresident companies investing in debt securities. Supply measures in subprogram \n\n \n\n(Loan 1576-PAK) and Capacity Building of the Securities Market (TA Loan 1577-PAK)  in Pakistan. Manila; ADB. \n2008.

Demand measures in subprogram 1 include (i) onboarding new retail \ninvestors through simplified KYC procedures with biometric verification, (ii) introducing volume-\nbased auctions with variance limits to develop a credible government yield curve, (iii) approving \na DMO staffing plan to strengthen debt management proficiency, and (iv) developing an SECP \npolicy  on  gender  mainstreaming  that  will  raise  demand  for  securities  through  the  increased \nparticipation of female investors since women\u2019s participation in Pakistan\u2019s capital markets is very \nlow.  Demand  measures  in  subprogram  2  will  (i)  put  the  DMO  staffing  plan  into  operation,  (ii) \neliminate  institutional  investors  from  participating  in  the  National  Savings  Scheme  to  promote \ncontractual savings institutions and pension fund demand in the capital markets, (iii) implement a \nbuyback of fragmented issues and replace them with liquid benchmark issues to create liquidity \nin  the  government  bond  market  keeping  in  view  cost  risk  trade  off,  and  (iv)  issue  women \nentrepreneur bonds whose proceeds will facilitate the financing of SMEs owned or led by women. \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB  is  regarded  by  the  government,  market  participants,  and \n21. \ndevelopment partners as a credible party that will ensure a balanced and professional approach \ndevoid of short-term interest and political interference. ADB offers an integrated approach  that \ncombines professional and impartial policy advice with financial support for adjustment, effective \nimplementation support, and capacity development through TA to ensure sustainability. Not many \ndevelopment partners have the same level of credibility,  or the means or capacity to offer  this \nsolutions-based  approach  that  can  effectively  tailor  these  best  practices  to  the  needs  and \nconditions of Pakistan\u2019s capital markets by also applying ADB\u2019s knowledge in similar programs \nacross the region. Without ADB involvement in capital market reforms, and given the complexities \ninvolved  and  the  resources  and  expertise  required,  such  reforms  would  not  have  progressed \nsuccessfully. \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  These  reforms  complement  other  initiatives,  such  as  the \n22. \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  $500  million  Resilient  Institutions  for  Sustainable  Economy  (RISE)  Program \ndevelopment  policy  financing  that  was  approved  in  June  2020,  and  the  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom\u2019s $10 million SECP Digitalization Project. The \nRISE Program will develop a legal framework for debt management, while the Department for \nInternational  Development  project  focuses  on  strengthening  the  SECP\u2019s  information  and \ncommunication technology systems. The IMF\u2019s $6 billion EFF program approved on 3 July 2019 \nfacilitates improved macroeconomic management, including through sound debt management. \nThe program builds on the legal and institutional foundations of sound debt management under \nthe  RISE  Program  and  the  EFF  by  developing  the  government  bond  market  through  the \nrealization  of  a  market-based  government  bond  market  yield  curve.  To  ensure  synergies  and \ncomplementarity, ADB is closely coordinating with the IMF and other development partners. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  overarching  development  objective:  capital \nmarkets act as a major catalyst in transforming the economy into a more efficient, innovative, and \ncompetitive marketplace within the global arena (footnote 4). The development of capital markets \nwill  contribute  toward  achieving  this  objective  by  stimulating  competition  with  the  banking \nsubsector that will lead to greater efficiencies and innovation. The program will have the following \nreform  effect:  the  capacity  and  size  of  the  capital  markets  are  augmented.  The  program  is \nstructured  around  four  reform  areas:  (i)  market  stability  strengthened,  (ii)  market  facilitation \nenhanced, (iii) supply measures enhanced, and (iv) demand measures enhanced. Subprogram 1 \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nreforms focus on strengthening the institutional and regulatory capacity of the SECP, the DMO, \nand  the AOB,  while  subprogram  2 will  catalyze  institutional  investor  demand and  increase  the \nsupply of alternative financial instruments, such as derivatives. The proposed reforms conform to \nbest  practices,  including  those  promulgated  by  the  International  Organization  of  Securities \nCommissions. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nD. \n \nBased on the development financing requirements of the program, ADB will provide policy-\n24. \nbased loans totaling $600 million to finance two subprograms under the programmatic approach. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  concessional  loan  of  $290.204  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan  will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  of  2%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has also requested  a regular \nloan of $9.796 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The \nloan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions as set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average loan maturity is 9.25 \nyears,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  The  development  policy  letter  is  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n25. \nPakistan\u2019s  development  financing  needs.  The  government\u2019s  financing  requirements \nare  expected  to  be  $78.79  billion  in  FY2021,  to  be  financed  by  domestic  and  foreign  sources \n(Table  1).  The  government\u2019s  foreign  borrowing  will  be  $15.15  billion  in  FY2021,  mainly  from \ninternational financial institutions and bilateral partners. \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Needs and Support for FY2021 \n($ million) \n\nItem \nGross financing requirement \nGross domestic financing \nGross foreign financinga \n  ADB\u2019s originally programmed and new policy-based loans \nThird Capital Market Development Program \nTrade and Competitiveness Program \nEnergy Sector Reform Program \n  World Bankb \n \n  Others (including bilateral partners, IDB, AIIB, euro bond)d \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,  EFF = Extended Fund Facility, FY = \nfiscal year, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \na  The amount includes policy-based lending operations. \nb  The World Bank will provide three development policy operations during FY2021. \nc  The IMF EFF loan disbursements are expected to continue during FY2021. \nd  This comprises a $0.500 billion loan from the AIIB, a $1.000 billion loan from the IDB, a $1.000 billion loan from Saudi \nArabia,  $1.500  billion from  a  euro  bond  issuance,  $3.922  billion  from commercial  banks,  and  $3.434  billion  from \nbilateral partners (People\u2019s Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates). \n\nFY2021 \n78,788 \n63,636 \n15,152 \n900 \n300 \n300 \n300 \n1,617 \n1,279 \n11,356 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIMFc \n\nSource: Government of Pakistan (Ministry of Finance), IMF, and ADB estimates. \n \nDebt  sustainability.  ADB\u2019s  debt  sustainability  analysis  concluded  that  the  total  public \n26. \ndebt\u2013GDP  ratio  will  reach  83.0%  in  FY2021  compared  with  82.9%  in  FY2020  and  76.7%  in \nFY2019.  However,  this  ratio  is  expected  to  decline  after  FY2021  and  stabilize  at  72.6%  by \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nFY2024. External debt risks remain high,  but the economy is expected to gradually  recover in \nFY2021, and external debt is projected to steadily decline and return to a more sustainable path \ndriven primarily by a lower current account deficit, non-debt-creating capital inflows, and higher \neconomic growth in subsequent years. More importantly, the availability of adequate concessional \nfinancing  from  ADB  will  provide  much-needed  fiscal  resources  and  allow  the  government  to \nprioritize its development expenditure on productive investments. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe executing agency will be the MOF. The implementing agencies will be the SBP and \nthe  SECP.  A  program  steering  committee  has  been  established  to  oversee  and  coordinate \nprogram implementation; it will also include all relevant departments of  the MOF, SBP, SECP, \nand  the  PSX.  The  indicative  implementation  periods  are  June  2019\u2013September  2020  for \nsubprogram 1 and October 2020\u2013October 2022 for subprogram 2. \n \n28. \nDisbursement and counterpart funds. The loans will be provided in two subprograms \nand will be disbursed upon fulfillment of their respective program policy actions (Appendix 4). The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n29. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6).  The  TA  will  support  the  implementation  of  key \nreform  actions  under  the  program.  The  major  TA  outputs  and  activities  include  (i)  supporting \nlegislative  reforms  such  as  making  the  capital  market  tribunal  operational;  (ii)  supporting  the \ndiscontinuation of the margin trading system and development of derivatives; (iii) facilitating the \nenhancement  of  market  infrastructure;  (iv)  developing  asset-light  sukuk  structures  that  involve \nintangible assets; (v) building capacity and providing training, including strengthening the Institute \nof  Financial  Markets;  and  (vi)  supporting  the  installation  of  a  centralized  trading  platform  for \nprimary and secondary government debt markets.18 The MOF will be the executing agency. The \nSECP and SBP will be the implementing agencies for the TA, which will be implemented over 2 \nyears,  starting  in  July  2020.  ADB  will  engage  36  person-months  of  individual  international \nconsultants  and  16  person-months  of  individual  national  consultants  using  open  competitive \nbidding  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nassociated staff instructions. Disbursements under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office, office supplies, secretarial assistance, \nand other in-kind contributions. Transaction TA of $500,000 was approved in July 2019 for  the \npreparation of subprogram 1 and has been used to develop a diagnostic study and capital market \nmaster plan, review legislation, and draft required legislative changes. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nEconomic and financial. The program will facilitate the mobilization of financial resources \n30. \nfor  productive  investment,  especially  by  the  private  sector,  and  employment  generation  by \nsupporting the development of bond and equity capital markets. This will help reduce the cost of \nfinancial intermediation and help stabilize systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated finance \nsystem. The specific transmission channels are as follows: \n\n18 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBy  addressing  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  on  the  issuance  of  corporate \nsecurities, the program will help increase the number of bond and equity issues, \nboth primary and secondary. This will facilitate the mobilization of scarce financial \nresources for long-term private sector investment. \nBy  promoting  the  development  of  corporate  securities  markets  and  institutional \ninvestors, thereby diversifying financial instruments and broadening the investor \nbase, the program will reduce market volatility and improve the resilience of the \nfinance sector to external shocks. \nBy strengthening market governance in capital markets, the program will enhance \nmarket efficiency and transparency, and improve investor protection. \n\n \n31. \nGovernance. The governance risk assessment followed the Guidelines for Implementing \nADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.19 It found risks that could affect the \nprogrammatic  approach,  such  as  (i)  sudden  changes  in  administrative  procedures,  ministry \nleadership, and/or major staff turnover that may hinder smooth implementation of reforms cause \ndelays; (ii) political support and government ownership of reforms, envisaged under the program, \nwanes;  and  (iii)  institutional  capacity  is  weak.  While  no  major  risks  of  mismanagement  of \nresources  at  the  implementing  level  were  discerned,  and  Pakistan  has  extensive  centralized \nlegislative and institutional public financial management structures, budget execution remains an \narea of weakness. Institutional capacity development is targeted under the transaction TA and \npolicy changes under the program. \n \n32. \nPoverty and social. The capital market reforms under the program will lower the cost of \nfinancial intermediation and facilitate private sector investment that will lead to higher sustainable \ngrowth  and  generate  job  opportunities.  The  program  also  mitigates  the  negative  impact  that \ncapital market instability has on the plight of the poor. It also helps Pakistan diversify its financial \nsystem  so  that  the  country  can  realize  its  broad-based  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  objectives,  including  poverty  reduction.  The  program  seeks  to  address  gender \ndisparities, particularly women\u2019s limited access to capital markets (women comprise more than \n49%  of  the  population  but  only  7%  of  women  in  Pakistan  have  access  to  financial  inclusion \nservices). 20  The  program  promotes  the  approval  and  implementation  of  key  gender  policy \ndocuments at the SECP and PSX, including the legal framework for Women Entrepreneur Bonds. \n \n33. \nSafeguards.  The  program  will  have  no  anticipated  direct  or  indirect  environmental \nimpacts, will not cause involuntary resettlement, and will have no impacts on indigenous peoples. \nIn this regard, the program is classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples. \n \n34. \nRisks and mitigating measures. The program\u2019s risk assessment is rated moderate since \n(i)  ADB  has  solid  experience  in  the  sector  in  Pakistan;  (ii)  the  MOF,  the  proposed  executing \nagency, has a good performance record in externally  financed project implementation; and (iii) \nthe  program  is  unlikely  to  have  any  impact  on  safeguards.  Major  risks  that  could  affect  the \nprogram implementation and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\n \n\n19 ADB.  2008.
