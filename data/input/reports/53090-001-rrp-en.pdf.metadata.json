By improving access to finance, the project will support the expansion of \nMSMEs  and  diversification  of  the  economy,  which  will  in  turn  contribute  to  employment  and \npoverty reduction. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic overview. After a period of slow growth in 2015\u22122016, Mongolia\u2019s economy \nstarted to recover in 2017 with commodity price increases and higher foreign direct investment in \nmining  as main contributors,  as  well  as rising  demand in consumption and  increased  credit to \nhouseholds. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth further accelerated from 5.3% (2017) to 6.9% \n(2018), facilitated by expanding manufacturing and services sectors as well as strong investment \nin mining. For the first time since 2012, the fiscal balance reached a surplus and the public debt \nto GDP ratio  improved from  99.2%  (2017)  to  86.2% (2018).  ADB  forecasts GDP  growth  to  be \nmoderate\u23af6.7%  in  2019  and  6.3%  in  2020,  with  the  expectation  that  a  more  accommodative \nfiscal  policy  will  support  domestic  demand  and  foreign  direct  investment  in  mining  will  remain \nimportant. 2 Macroeconomic  downside  risks  include  the  adverse  impact  of  the  ongoing  trade \ntensions between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the United States (US) that may squeeze \nMongolia\u2019s mineral exports. In addition, the anticipated 2020 parliamentary elections may trigger \nfiscal and monetary loosening, which may impact exchange rate stability and foreign exchange \nreserves.  Regional  inequality  remains  significant.  The  World  Bank  estimates  a  poverty  rate  of \n25.9% in Ulaanbaatar versus 32.9% in rural areas in 2018.3 In 2018, the three international rating \nagencies  upgraded  the  foreign  currency  sovereign  rating  for  Mongolia  by  one  notch  to:  B  by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s, B3 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and B by Fitch Ratings. \n \n4. \nMicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises sector. As mining accounts for about one-\nfifth  of  GDP  and  80%  of  export  earnings,  Mongolia  is  highly  dependent  on  global  commodity \ncycles.4 With  mining  representing  less  than  4%  of  total  employment,  it  is  important  to  support \ninclusive  growth  via  economic  diversification  and  promote  MSMEs  as  an  important  sector  of \nemployment.  The  government  supports  this  sector  by  providing  loans  through  the  SME \n\n \n\n1  MSMEs to be financed by the proposed loan include micro-enterprises and retail SMEs (small enterprises and lower \nmedium-sized enterprises) per XacBank\u2019s segmentation, which are defined as enterprises with annual turnover of \nunder MNT3 billion or employees of less than 30.  \n\n2  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Fund and technical assistance.5 MSMEs comprise 90.0% of registered businesses \nand  generate  about  50.0%  of  employment.6 MSMEs  consistently  report  access  to  credit  as  a \nmajor barrier to investment and growth.7 As of March 2019, small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs)  loans  accounted  for  only  19.8%  of  the  banking  sector\u2019s  outstanding  loans.8 MSMEs \naccess  to  finance,  especially  for  women-owned  entities,  is  constrained  by  high  interest  rates, \nshort-tenor  loans  that  do  not  match  the  cash  flows  of  investments,  and  stringent  collateral \nrequirements  that  many  MSMEs  cannot  meet.  Low  financial  literacy  is  also  a  problem  among \nsmaller  entities.  Despite  comprising  46.2%  of  the  workforce,  Mongolian  women  are  less  likely \nthan men to own assets that can be accepted as collateral, making banks hesitant to lend them \nmoney. This situation persists even though women have higher repayment rates than their male \ncounterparts. Only 19.2% of married women in rural areas own land either individually or jointly \nwith their husbands.9  \n \n5. \nFinance sector overview. The Mongolian finance sector consists of 13 commercial banks \nof  which  12  are  privately  owned  and  one  is  state-owned,  534  nonbank  financial  institutions \n(NBFIs), and 207 savings and credit cooperatives. The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) is responsible \nfor  supervising  the  banks,  while  the  Financial  Regulatory  Commission  is  responsible  for \nsupervising  NBFIs  including  insurance  companies,  security  firms,  and  savings  and  credit \ncooperatives. Commercial banks provided 97.0% of loans in 2018.10 Total assets of the banking \nsector increased by 14.8% to MNT33.1 trillion in 2018. BOM classified the top five banks\u23afKhan \nBank, TDB, Golomt Bank, XacBank, and State Bank\u23afas systemically important. These banks \naccounted for 86.0% of the banking system assets. Currently, commercial banks follow the Basel \nI regulatory framework. Implementation of the Basel II framework is expected by the end of 2019.   \n \nIn February 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers \u010cesk\u00e1 Republika S.R.O. carried out an asset \n6. \nquality  review  (AQR)  of  the  banking  system  as  required  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund \n(IMF).11 The AQR identified an aggregate capital shortfall representing 3.1% of GDP (2017). BOM \nrequired the banks with capital shortfalls to meet additional capital requirements by December \n2018. In Moody\u2019s opinion issued in August 2018, all systemically important banks had sufficient \ncapital by June 2018 reflecting full loan loss provisions and asset valuation losses.12 However, \nthe banking sector remains vulnerable with questionable origins of funds used for recapitalization \nof  certain  banks  and  the  slow  recapitalization  of  smaller  banks.  The  AQR  also  led  to  a \nreclassification of problem assets resulting in an increase of the banks\u2019 average nonperforming \n\n \n\n5  The SME Development Fund provided MNT276.1 billion loans to 1,864 MSMEs during 2013\u22122016. \n6  ADB. 2018.

ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations in Mongolia\u2019s finance sector have targeted the \n7. \nunderserved MSMEs given the vital role that they currently play in overall employment and the \npotential  they  have  in  furthering  economic  diversification.14 Given  its  strong  positioning  as  an \nMSME market leader and its commitment to service women-led MSMEs, ADB selected XacBank \nas  a  partner.15 The  proposed  transaction  will  constitute  the  second  ADB  loan  to  XacBank;16 \nhowever,  this  is  the  first  time  that  ADB\u2019s  loan  may  be  partially  denominated  in  togrog,  funded \nthrough ADB local currency bond issuance. The current project also sets more ambitious gender \ntargets as compared with the earlier project. XacBank is owned by reputable shareholders and \nhas  sound  corporate  governance,  experienced  management,  advanced  risk  management \nsystems,  and  has  displayed  solid financial  performance  and  capital  adequacy  in  a  challenging \noperating environment.   \n \nThe design of the proposed transaction builds on the lessons of previous ADB support for \n8. \nMSME financing in Mongolia. XacBank weathered the 2016\u22122017 economic downturn relatively \nwell compared to other banks but needed to adjust its growth strategy and as a result could not \nmeet the original targets of ADB\u2019s first loan (footnote 16). This resulted in a less than satisfactory \nrating  in  ADB\u2019s  ex-post  evaluation.17 For  the  proposed  project,  ADB  has  considered  possible \nvolatility  of  such resource-based  economies  and  the resulting  impacts  on  the  borrower  and  its \ntarget clients when setting out the development targets in the design and monitoring framework. \nAnother important aspect is that ADB has  now established effective solutions for offering local \ncurrency  loans  via  ADB  bond  issuances,  which  will  mitigate  currency  induced  risk  for  ADB\u2019s \nborrowers and their MSME clients.18  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nXacBank was established as the result of a merger of the two largest NBFIs in Mongolia, \nGoviin Ekhlel LLC and X.A.C LLC in 2001. With total assets of MNT3,156 billion at the end of \nJune  2019,  XacBank  is  Mongolia\u2019s  fourth-largest  commercial  bank,  representing  about  10% \nmarket share. It operates in all 21 provinces and the capital, serving more than 700,000 customers \nthrough  87  branches,  as  well  as  specialized  banking  outlets.  XacBank  has  about  1,300  staff \n(2018).  \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\n13 Bank  of  Mongolia.

Most MSME loans \nare secured. XacBank will focus on the automation of its main business lines to scale-up its core \nbusiness. It has invested heavily in digital transformation including expanding its ATM and point \nof  sales  networks,  loan  origination,  payments,  and  establishing  mobile  and  internet  banking \nplatforms  utilizing  suitable  FinTech  solutions.  To  expand  its  cost-effective  branchless  retail \nbusiness in rural areas, XacBank has partnered with a mobile telecom company and large gas \nstation operators.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nOwnership. XacBank is fully owned by the TenGer Financial Group, which is a Mongolian \nfinancial services group incorporated in 2001 that provides a range of financial services including \nbanking, leasing, insurance, and asset management and security services. As of 30 June 2019, \nTenGer  Financial  Group\u2019s  major  shareholders  were  Mongolyn  Alt  Corporation  (20.0%), \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (17.2%),  ORIX  Corporation  (16.8%),  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and Development  (12.9%),  National  Bank  of  Canada  (10.5%),  Ronoc (10.2%), \nMongolia Opportunities Fund (6.6%), and Triodos Fair Share Fund (3.7%). The remaining small \nshareholders are the Open Society Forum Mongolia, Rotary Club of Ulaanbaatar, and Mongolian \nindividuals.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence  and  found  no  significant  or  potentially \nsignificant  integrity  risks. 19  The  identified  beneficial  owners  do  not  appear  to  constitute  a \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risk, in the absence of any unresolved or substantiated \nadverse media or other information. Two directors on the board of XacBank and several directors \non the boards of shareholder companies are politically exposed persons, however, none are the \nsubject of adverse news. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is \nbeing  used  for  money  laundering  or  terrorism  financing.  Tax  integrity  due  diligence  was  not \nrequired given that there is no substantial ownership through intermediate jurisdictions or material \nrelated-party transactions. \n \n12.  Management.  An  experienced  management  team,  comprised  of  the  chief  executive \nofficer (CEO), chief risk officer, chief financial officer, chief credit officer, chief human resources \nofficer, chief operations officer, chief audit, chief investor relations and corporate affairs officer, \npresident of business banking, and the president of retail banking leads XacBank. In May 2019, \nXacBank\u2019s board appointed Tsevegjav Gumenjav as CEO after having served as the president \nof retail banking (November 2018\u2212April 2019) and chief retail banking and chief financial officer. \nPrior to joining  XacBank,  he  served  as  CEO  of XacLeasing,  chairman  of the  board of  TenGer \nInsurance  LLC,  and  treasury  manager  at  a  multi-brand  company  based  in  San  Francisco, \nCalifornia, in the U.S.20 \n \n13. \nGovernance structure. XacBank has a well-defined corporate governance structure in \nline  with  international  best  practice.  The  board  of  directors  provides  strategic  guidance  and \nleadership  of  the  bank  by  setting  strategy  and  policy.  The  board  consists  of  nine  members \nincluding the chairman, one executive director, five non-executive directors, and two independent \ndirectors.21 Sanjay Gupta was elected in March 2019 as the chairman of the board of directors of \nXacBank and TenGer Financial Group. Previously, he served on the board for 2 years as non-\nexecutive director. He has 34 years of banking experience in senior leadership roles in Asia and \n\n \n\n19 ADB. 2003.

ADB expects to syndicate a B loan of up to $30 million \namong  eligible  B  loan  participants.  At  least  a  portion  of  the  A  loan  will  be  denominated  in  US \ndollars as the anchor for the B loan syndication. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nUse of proceeds. The loan facility will fund XacBank\u2019s lending operations to MSMEs in \nMongolia. No less than 33% of the A loan proceeds will be deployed by XacBank for lending to \nMSMEs that are women-led or are women sole proprietorships. No less than 40% of the A loan \nproceeds will be provided by XacBank to finance MSMEs located outside of Ulaanbaatar, where \neconomic development lags behind the capital and the poverty rate is 7% higher. \n \nReporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the transaction until the loan is fully repaid. \n16. \nXacBank  will  report  to  ADB  periodically  and  on  particular  requests.  These  reports  will  include \nquarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  annual  audited  financial  statements,  compliance \ncertificates  on  financial  covenants,  progress  reports  of  XacBank\u2019s  MSME  lending  program  in \nrespect of development effectiveness, and the gender action plan (GAP). ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations  Department  will  prepare  the  monitoring  report  regularly,  at  least  annually,  and  will \nsubmit the first monitoring report no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nProviding  critically  needed  long-term  finance.  Mongolia  is  a small  volatile  economy \nthat  carries  high  country  risks.  Hence,  capital  markets  remain  undeveloped  and  foreign \ncommercial bank funding remains the exception. Most domestic market borrowings are short term \nwith tenor of up to 1 year. Due to challenging market conditions, IFI funding is an important source \nof  funding  for  XacBank.  ADB  will  provide  stable  long-term  financing,  which  will  help  limit \nXacBank\u2019s  funding  risk  and  enable  the  bank  to  develop  its  MSME  business  on  a  sustainable \nbasis.  \n \n18. \nCatalyzing private sector funding and support. ADB is expected to mobilize additional \nprivate  sector  funding for this  project  under  a  B  loan structure,  which  will  help further  diversify \nXacBank\u2019s long-term funding base. \n \n19. \nProviding  local  currency  finance  from  international  investors.  IFIs  fund  the  bank \nmostly  in  US  dollars  that  require  hedging  of  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  ADB  has  received \nregulatory approvals to raise local currency financing through the issuance of an off-shore togrog \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \n\n\flinker bond.22 Subject to market conditions, the proposed transaction may be partially funded by \nADB\u2019s inaugural offshore togrog-linked bond for Mongolia, which will provide long-term fixed-rate \nlocal currency funding that is not readily available in the local market.  \n \nSupporting gender equity. The transaction is classified as gender equity theme and ADB \n20. \nhas worked with XacBank to set gender-specific disbursement targets. At least one-third of the A \nloan proceeds will be used for lending to women-led MSMEs. XacBank will implement a GAP to \nenhance its outreach to women-led MSMEs, strengthen staff skills, and heighten the awareness \nto service women borrowers. 23  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\n \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nOutcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be improved credit access of Mongolian MSMEs. \n\n \nA. \n \nImpacts. The proposed loan will support the government\u2019s strategy to restore inclusive \n21. \neconomic growth to revitalize the economy and improve the well-being of its citizens by improving \nthe  resilience  of  the  finance  sector  and  enhancing  financial  intermediation  especially  to  micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises and other underserved segments. \n \n22. \n \n23. \nOutputs. The outputs will be (i) XacBank\u2019s lending capacity to MSMEs, including those \nled by women and located outside Ulaanbaatar, is increased; and (ii) XacBank\u2019s ability to render \nservices to women is enhanced.  \n \nB. \n \n24. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The transaction supports two \npriorities  of  Strategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  and  (ii) \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality.24 Strategy  2030  highlights  ADB\u2019s  supports  for  SMEs \nand  inclusive  businesses  to  help  generate  quality  jobs  and  support  inclusive  growth.  It \nemphasizes ADB\u2019s  support to the finance  sector  by helping  to  develop financial  infrastructure, \ninstitutions, and products and services. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2017\u22122020 for Mongolia.25 Under the pillar of promoting economic and social stability, \nADB will promote labor-intensive growth outside the mining sector through SME development by \nimproving their access to finance and by establishing credit lines for key financial institutions. The \nproposed  project  will  improve  MSMEs\u2019  access to finance  by  providing much-needed  long-term \nfinance to a local bank. It will also help to tackle the persistent gender gap in the country and is \nthus aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u2013\n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n22 In a linker bond structure, the international investor provides and receives foreign currency, most likely US dollars, \nwhile retaining the local currency exchange fluctuation risk. XacBank will convert the US dollar payments into togrog \nand togrog repayments into US dollars at the applicable spot exchange rates.  \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB.  2018.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (2009)  as FI  treated  as  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.28  \n \n26. \nEnvironmental and social safeguards. The ADB loan facility will fund XacBank\u2019s MSME \nfinance operations in Mongolia, which will specifically exclude sub-loans that are categorized A \nor  B  for  impacts  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  based  on \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. XacBank provides sub-loans to MSMEs, which are mostly in \nthe service and trade sectors such as small tourist camp operators, bakery shops, and individual \ntraders.  Sub-loans  to  MSMEs  in  the  manufacturing  sector  are  usually  for  working  capital  or \npurchase of equipment. MSME clients involved in the mining sector are raw material or service \nsuppliers rather than small mining companies. XacBank\u2019s current and likely future MSME portfolio \nare likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. Climate change impact from the \nproject is expected to be low due to the nature and scale of MSME sub-loans that may be financed \nby ADB loan proceeds. No land acquisition, physical, or economic displacement, or impact on \nindigenous peoples\u2019  communities  is  foreseen  in relation to any  activities of the sub-borrowers. \nXacBank implemented a social and environmental management system (SEMS) in compliance \nwith  IFC\u2019s  environmental  and  social  performance  standards,  and  further  enhanced  it  to  meet \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirement prior to the disbursement of the earlier ADB loan. \nThe  SEMS  policy  document  guides  XacBank\u2019s  environmentally  sound  and  sustainable \ndevelopment principles and ensures that its MSME finance operations comply with national laws \nand regulations of Mongolia. No MSME activities with adverse impact on environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples were financed using the proceeds of the earlier ADB loan, \nand  due  diligence  confirmed  the  adequacy  of  its  SEMS  to  screen  and  exclude  any  potential \ncategory  A  or  B  sub-loans  from  the  proposed  ADB  finance.  Consistent  with  the  earlier \narrangements, XacBank will (i) apply its SEMS and exclusion list for finance, which are aligned \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements,  including  ADB's  prohibited  investment \nactivities list, (ii) exclude all projects that will have adverse environmental and social safeguards \nimpacts,  (iii)  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations,  and  (iv)  comply  with  the  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.29 XacBank  will \nconfirm these in its periodic report to ADB. \n \n27. \nLabor  and  social  protection.  XacBank  ensures  its  and  its  sub-borrowers  compliance \nwith national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, takes measures to \ncomply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.30 As  part  of  the  loan  application \nprocess,  XacBank  evaluates  performance  of  its  sub-borrowers  on  occupational  safety,  proper \n\n \n\n26 ADB.  2013.
