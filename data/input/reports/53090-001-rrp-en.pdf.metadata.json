THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $60,000,000 (or its equivalent in togrog), comprising (i) a senior unsecured A loan of up to \n$30,000,000 (or its equivalent in togrog), and (ii) a senior unsecured B loan of up to $30,000,000, \nto XacBank LLC (XacBank) for the Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises Financing Project \nin Mongolia.1  \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-term financing to \nXacBank  to  support  its  lending  operations  to  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(MSMEs) in Mongolia. By improving access to finance, the project will support the expansion of \nMSMEs and diversification of the economy, which will in turn contribute to employment and \npoverty reduction. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Economic overview. After a period of slow growth in 2015\u22122016, Mongolia\u2019s economy \nstarted to recover in 2017 with commodity price increases and higher foreign direct investment in \nmining as main contributors, as well as rising demand in consumption and increased credit to \nhouseholds. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth further accelerated from 5.3% (2017) to 6.9% \n(2018), facilitated by expanding manufacturing and services sectors as well as strong investment \nin mining. For the first time since 2012, the fiscal balance reached a surplus and the public debt \nto GDP ratio improved from 99.2% (2017) to 86.2% (2018). ADB forecasts GDP growth to be \nmoderate\u23af6.7% in 2019 and 6.3% in 2020, with the expectation that a more accommodative \nfiscal policy will support domestic demand and foreign direct investment in mining will remain \nimportant.2 Macroeconomic downside risks include the adverse impact of the ongoing trade \ntensions between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the United States (US) that may squeeze \nMongolia\u2019s mineral exports. In addition, the anticipated 2020 parliamentary elections may trigger \nfiscal and monetary loosening, which may impact exchange rate stability and foreign exchange \nreserves. Regional inequality remains significant. The World Bank estimates a poverty rate of \n25.9% in Ulaanbaatar versus 32.9% in rural areas in 2018.3 In 2018, the three international rating \nagencies upgraded the foreign currency sovereign rating for Mongolia by one notch to: B by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s, B3 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and B by Fitch Ratings. \n \n4.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises sector. As mining accounts for about one-\nfifth of GDP and 80% of export earnings, Mongolia is highly dependent on global commodity \ncycles.4 With mining representing less than 4% of total employment, it is important to support \ninclusive growth via economic diversification and promote MSMEs as an important sector of \nemployment.  The  government  supports  this  sector  by  providing  loans  through  the  SME \n \n1  MSMEs to be financed by the proposed loan include micro-enterprises and retail SMEs (small enterprises and lower \nmedium-sized enterprises) per XacBank\u2019s segmentation, which are defined as enterprises with annual turnover of \nunder MNT3 billion or employees of less than 30.  \n2  ADB. 2019.

Low financial literacy is also a problem among \nsmaller entities. Despite comprising 46.2% of the workforce, Mongolian women are less likely \nthan men to own assets that can be accepted as collateral, making banks hesitant to lend them \nmoney. This situation persists even though women have higher repayment rates than their male \ncounterparts. Only 19.2% of married women in rural areas own land either individually or jointly \nwith their husbands.9  \n \n5.  Finance sector overview. The Mongolian finance sector consists of 13 commercial banks \nof which 12 are privately owned and one is state-owned, 534 nonbank financial institutions \n(NBFIs), and 207 savings and credit cooperatives. The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) is responsible \nfor  supervising  the  banks,  while  the  Financial  Regulatory  Commission  is  responsible  for \nsupervising  NBFIs  including  insurance  companies,  security  firms,  and  savings  and  credit \ncooperatives. Commercial banks provided 97.0% of loans in 2018.10 Total assets of the banking \nsector increased by 14.8% to MNT33.1 trillion in 2018. BOM classified the top five banks\u23afKhan \nBank, TDB, Golomt Bank, XacBank, and State Bank\u23afas systemically important. These banks \naccounted for 86.0% of the banking system assets. Currently, commercial banks follow the Basel \nI regulatory framework. Implementation of the Basel II framework is expected by the end of 2019.   \n \n6.  In February 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers \u010cesk\u00e1 Republika S.R.O. carried out an asset \nquality review (AQR) of the banking system as required by the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF).11 The AQR identified an aggregate capital shortfall representing 3.1% of GDP (2017). BOM \nrequired the banks with capital shortfalls to meet additional capital requirements by December \n2018. In Moody\u2019s opinion issued in August 2018, all systemically important banks had sufficient \ncapital by June 2018 reflecting full loan loss provisions and asset valuation losses.12 However, \nthe banking sector remains vulnerable with questionable origins of funds used for recapitalization \nof  certain  banks  and  the  slow  recapitalization  of  smaller  banks.  The  AQR  also  led  to  a \nreclassification of problem assets resulting in an increase of the banks\u2019 average nonperforming \n \n5  The SME Development Fund provided MNT276.1 billion loans to 1,864 MSMEs during 2013\u22122016. \n6  ADB. 2018.

Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations in Mongolia\u2019s finance sector have targeted the \nunderserved MSMEs given the vital role that they currently play in overall employment and the \npotential they have in furthering economic diversification.14 Given its strong positioning as an \nMSME market leader and its commitment to service women-led MSMEs, ADB selected XacBank \nas a partner.15 The proposed transaction will constitute the second ADB loan to XacBank;16 \nhowever, this is the first time that ADB\u2019s loan may be partially denominated in togrog, funded \nthrough ADB local currency bond issuance. The current project also sets more ambitious gender \ntargets as compared with the earlier project. XacBank is owned by reputable shareholders and \nhas  sound  corporate  governance,  experienced  management,  advanced  risk  management \nsystems, and has displayed solid financial performance and capital adequacy in a challenging \noperating environment.   \n \n8.  The design of the proposed transaction builds on the lessons of previous ADB support for \nMSME financing in Mongolia. XacBank weathered the 2016\u22122017 economic downturn relatively \nwell compared to other banks but needed to adjust its growth strategy and as a result could not \nmeet the original targets of ADB\u2019s first loan (footnote 16). This resulted in a less than satisfactory \nrating in ADB\u2019s ex-post evaluation.17 For the proposed project, ADB has considered possible \nvolatility of such resource-based economies and the resulting impacts on the borrower and its \ntarget clients when setting out the development targets in the design and monitoring framework. \nAnother important aspect is that ADB has now established effective solutions for offering local \ncurrency loans via ADB bond issuances, which will mitigate currency induced risk for ADB\u2019s \nborrowers and their MSME clients.18  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  XacBank was established as the result of a merger of the two largest NBFIs in Mongolia, \nGoviin Ekhlel LLC and X.A.C LLC in 2001. With total assets of MNT3,156 billion at the end of \nJune 2019, XacBank is Mongolia\u2019s fourth-largest commercial bank, representing about 10% \nmarket share. It operates in all 21 provinces and the capital, serving more than 700,000 customers \nthrough 87 branches, as well as specialized banking outlets. XacBank has about 1,300 staff \n(2018).  \n \n13 Bank  of  Mongolia.

The  bank\u2019s  MSME  clients  typically  run  services  and  trade  businesses,  small  agri-\nprocessing and manufacturing facilities along the supply chain of corporations. Most MSME loans \nare secured. XacBank will focus on the automation of its main business lines to scale-up its core \nbusiness. It has invested heavily in digital transformation including expanding its ATM and point \nof sales networks, loan origination, payments, and establishing mobile and internet banking \nplatforms  utilizing  suitable  FinTech  solutions. To  expand  its  cost-effective  branchless  retail \nbusiness in rural areas, XacBank has partnered with a mobile telecom company and large gas \nstation operators.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  Ownership. XacBank is fully owned by the TenGer Financial Group, which is a Mongolian \nfinancial services group incorporated in 2001 that provides a range of financial services including \nbanking, leasing, insurance, and asset management and security services. As of 30 June 2019, \nTenGer  Financial  Group\u2019s  major  shareholders  were  Mongolyn  Alt  Corporation  (20.0%), \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (17.2%),  ORIX  Corporation  (16.8%),  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (12.9%), National Bank of Canada (10.5%), Ronoc (10.2%), \nMongolia Opportunities Fund (6.6%), and Triodos Fair Share Fund (3.7%). The remaining small \nshareholders are the Open Society Forum Mongolia, Rotary Club of Ulaanbaatar, and Mongolian \nindividuals.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence  and  found  no  significant  or  potentially \nsignificant  integrity  risks.19 The  identified  beneficial  owners  do  not  appear  to  constitute  a \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risk, in the absence of any unresolved or substantiated \nadverse media or other information. Two directors on the board of XacBank and several directors \non the boards of shareholder companies are politically exposed persons, however, none are the \nsubject of adverse news. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is \nbeing used for money laundering or terrorism financing. Tax integrity due diligence was not \nrequired given that there is no substantial ownership through intermediate jurisdictions or material \nrelated-party transactions. \n \n12.  Management. An experienced management team, comprised of the chief executive \nofficer (CEO), chief risk officer, chief financial officer, chief credit officer, chief human resources \nofficer, chief operations officer, chief audit, chief investor relations and corporate affairs officer, \npresident of business banking, and the president of retail banking leads XacBank. In May 2019, \nXacBank\u2019s board appointed Tsevegjav Gumenjav as CEO after having served as the president \nof retail banking (November 2018\u2212April 2019) and chief retail banking and chief financial officer. \nPrior to joining XacBank, he served as CEO of XacLeasing, chairman of the board of TenGer \nInsurance LLC, and treasury manager at a multi-brand company based in San Francisco, \nCalifornia, in the U.S.20 \n \n13.  Governance structure. XacBank has a well-defined corporate governance structure in \nline with international best practice. The board of directors provides strategic guidance and \nleadership of the bank by setting strategy and policy. The board consists of nine members \nincluding the chairman, one executive director, five non-executive directors, and two independent \ndirectors.21 Sanjay Gupta was elected in March 2019 as the chairman of the board of directors of \nXacBank and TenGer Financial Group. Previously, he served on the board for 2 years as non-\nexecutive director. He has 34 years of banking experience in senior leadership roles in Asia and \n \n19 ADB. 2003.

The two independent directors serve on the risk \nmanagement committee and the audit committee.  \n \n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n14.  ADB will provide a senior A loan facility to XacBank of up to $30 million (or its togrog \nequivalent) with a tenor of up to 5 years. ADB expects to syndicate a B loan of up to $30 million \namong eligible B loan participants. At least a portion of the A loan will be denominated in US \ndollars as the anchor for the B loan syndication. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  Use of proceeds. The loan facility will fund XacBank\u2019s lending operations to MSMEs in \nMongolia. No less than 33% of the A loan proceeds will be deployed by XacBank for lending to \nMSMEs that are women-led or are women sole proprietorships. No less than 40% of the A loan \nproceeds will be provided by XacBank to finance MSMEs located outside of Ulaanbaatar, where \neconomic development lags behind the capital and the poverty rate is 7% higher. \n \n16.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the transaction until the loan is fully repaid. \nXacBank will report to ADB periodically and on particular requests. These reports will include \nquarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  annual  audited  financial  statements,  compliance \ncertificates on financial covenants, progress reports of XacBank\u2019s MSME lending program in \nrespect of development effectiveness, and the gender action plan (GAP). ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department will prepare the monitoring report regularly, at least annually, and will \nsubmit the first monitoring report no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n17.  Providing critically needed long-term finance. Mongolia is a small volatile economy \nthat  carries  high  country  risks.  Hence,  capital  markets  remain  undeveloped  and  foreign \ncommercial bank funding remains the exception. Most domestic market borrowings are short term \nwith tenor of up to 1 year. Due to challenging market conditions, IFI funding is an important source \nof  funding  for  XacBank.  ADB  will  provide  stable  long-term  financing,  which  will  help  limit \nXacBank\u2019s funding risk and enable the bank to develop its MSME business on a sustainable \nbasis.  \n \n18.  Catalyzing private sector funding and support. ADB is expected to mobilize additional \nprivate sector funding for this project under a B loan structure, which will help further diversify \nXacBank\u2019s long-term funding base. \n \n19.  Providing local currency finance from international investors. IFIs fund the bank \nmostly in US dollars that require hedging of the foreign exchange risk. ADB has received \nregulatory approvals to raise local currency financing through the issuance of an off-shore togrog \n ", "6 \nlinker bond.22 Subject to market conditions, the proposed transaction may be partially funded by \nADB\u2019s inaugural offshore togrog-linked bond for Mongolia, which will provide long-term fixed-rate \nlocal currency funding that is not readily available in the local market.  \n \n20.  Supporting gender equity. The transaction is classified as gender equity theme and ADB \nhas worked with XacBank to set gender-specific disbursement targets. At least one-third of the A \nloan proceeds will be used for lending to women-led MSMEs. XacBank will implement a GAP to \nenhance its outreach to women-led MSMEs, strengthen staff skills, and heighten the awareness \nto service women borrowers. 23  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT   \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n21.  Impacts. The proposed loan will support the government\u2019s strategy to restore inclusive \neconomic growth to revitalize the economy and improve the well-being of its citizens by improving \nthe resilience of the finance sector and enhancing financial intermediation especially to micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises and other underserved segments. \n \n22.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be improved credit access of Mongolian MSMEs. \n \n23.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) XacBank\u2019s lending capacity to MSMEs, including those \nled by women and located outside Ulaanbaatar, is increased; and (ii) XacBank\u2019s ability to render \nservices to women is enhanced.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n24.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The transaction supports two \npriorities of Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, and (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality.24 Strategy 2030 highlights ADB\u2019s supports for SMEs \nand  inclusive  businesses  to  help  generate  quality  jobs  and  support  inclusive  growth.  It \nemphasizes ADB\u2019s support to the finance sector by helping to develop financial infrastructure, \ninstitutions, and products and services. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2017\u22122020 for Mongolia.25 Under the pillar of promoting economic and social stability, \nADB will promote labor-intensive growth outside the mining sector through SME development by \nimproving their access to finance and by establishing credit lines for key financial institutions. The \nproposed project will improve MSMEs\u2019 access to finance by providing much-needed long-term \nfinance to a local bank. It will also help to tackle the persistent gender gap in the country and is \nthus aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u2013\n \n22 In a linker bond structure, the international investor provides and receives foreign currency, most likely US dollars, \nwhile retaining the local currency exchange fluctuation risk. XacBank will convert the US dollar payments into togrog \nand togrog repayments into US dollars at the applicable spot exchange rates.  \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 2018.

ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as FI treated as C for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.28  \n \n26.  Environmental and social safeguards. The ADB loan facility will fund XacBank\u2019s MSME \nfinance operations in Mongolia, which will specifically exclude sub-loans that are categorized A \nor B for impacts on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples based on \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. XacBank provides sub-loans to MSMEs, which are mostly in \nthe service and trade sectors such as small tourist camp operators, bakery shops, and individual \ntraders. Sub-loans to MSMEs in the manufacturing sector are usually for working capital or \npurchase of equipment. MSME clients involved in the mining sector are raw material or service \nsuppliers rather than small mining companies. XacBank\u2019s current and likely future MSME portfolio \nare likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. Climate change impact from the \nproject is expected to be low due to the nature and scale of MSME sub-loans that may be financed \nby ADB loan proceeds. No land acquisition, physical, or economic displacement, or impact on \nindigenous peoples\u2019 communities is foreseen in relation to any activities of the sub-borrowers. \nXacBank implemented a social and environmental management system (SEMS) in compliance \nwith IFC\u2019s environmental and social performance standards, and further enhanced it to meet \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirement prior to the disbursement of the earlier ADB loan. \nThe  SEMS  policy  document  guides  XacBank\u2019s  environmentally  sound  and  sustainable \ndevelopment principles and ensures that its MSME finance operations comply with national laws \nand regulations of Mongolia. No MSME activities with adverse impact on environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples were financed using the proceeds of the earlier ADB loan, \nand due diligence confirmed the adequacy of its SEMS to screen and exclude any potential \ncategory  A  or  B  sub-loans  from  the  proposed  ADB  finance.  Consistent  with  the  earlier \narrangements, XacBank will (i) apply its SEMS and exclusion list for finance, which are aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, including ADB's prohibited investment \nactivities list, (ii) exclude all projects that will have adverse environmental and social safeguards \nimpacts, (iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations, and (iv) comply with the with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.29 XacBank will \nconfirm these in its periodic report to ADB. \n \n27.  Labor and social protection. XacBank ensures its and its sub-borrowers compliance \nwith national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, takes measures to \ncomply with internationally recognized core labor standards.30 As part of the loan application \nprocess, XacBank evaluates performance of its sub-borrowers on occupational safety, proper \n \n26 ADB. 2013.

Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \nXacBank has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nin its business activities. Through the GAP, XacBank will implement measures to further empower \nand benefit women-led enterprises and further strengthen its institutional capacity to service \nwomen borrowers.

XacBank was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC.
