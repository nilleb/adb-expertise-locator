In  2010, \nSMEs  contributed  60%  of  gross  domestic  product,  provided  around  80%  of  new  urban \nemployment (with particular benefit to low-income workers and socially vulnerable groups), and \nintroduced 75% of new technologies.2 The PRC aims to further develop SMEs by accelerating \ntheir  economic  transformation,  enhancing  the  provision  of  services,  and  promoting  their \nsustainable growth.3 \n \n3. \nOn the other hand, SMEs are becoming major polluters, and are associated with severe \nenvironmental  impact  in  some  industrial  areas.  More  than  80%  of  SMEs  generate  pollution  in \nindustrial  production,  accounting  for  60%  of  the  pollution  generated  in  the  PRC.4 Most  face \nchallenges  in  their  production  processes,  such  as  obsolete  technologies,  low  efficiency,  and \nhigh  water  consumption.5 Among  various  pollution  indicators  for  wastewater,  chemical  oxygen \ndemand  and  ammonia  nitrogen  have  been  specially  targeted  by  the  government  for  control. \nIndustries  where  SMEs  are  responsible  for  wastewater  with  the  highest  levels  of  chemical \noxygen  demand  and  ammonia  nitrogen  are  the  paper,  food  processing,  chemical,  and  textile \nindustries. \n \n4. \nIndustrial  wastewater  is  difficult  to  treat  due  to  high  pollutant  concentration,  complex \nchemical composition, and high variance in water quantity and quality. In the PRC, treatment of \nindustrial  wastewater  is  handled  separately  from  sewage  pipeline  networks  operated  by  the \nmunicipal governments. Large industrial enterprises often operate their own treatment systems \non  site,  discharging  treated  wastewater  into  rivers  and  bypassing  municipal  wastewater \ntreatment facilities. Most SMEs, however, do not have sufficient treatment capability and instead \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   W.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\ntend to dump untreated wastewater into waterways or sewers at volumes that often exceed the \ncapacity of municipal wastewater treatment facilities.6 \n \n5. \nAn additional challenge arises from sludge, a waste by-product of wastewater treatment \nor waste from industrial processes. More than 80% of sludge is untreated in the PRC, which has \nserious impact on soil and groundwater quality.7 Sludge from industry is particularly toxic, since \nit can be higher in heavy metal content (70%\u201390% of heavy metals are absorbed into sludge). \n \nTo address increasing impacts on health caused by pollution from industrial wastewater, \n6. \nthe government is taking urgent action. In January 2015, an amended Environmental Protection \nLaw  took  effect;  the  law\u2019s  amendments  raised  wastewater  discharge  standards  and  imposed \nsevere  punishments  on  noncompliant  enterprises,  including  criminal  penalties  and  uncapped \nfines.8 In  April  2015,  the  State  Council  released  the  Water  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control \nAction Plan, widely  viewed as the PRC\u2019s most comprehensive and aggressive policy measure \nto  arrest  water  pollution. 9 Further,  wastewater  treatment  standards  have  been  progressively \ntightened for specific industrial subsectors.10 Tougher regulation raises particular challenges for \nSMEs; whereas environmental agencies tend to monitor and ensure environmental compliance \nfrom  larger-scale  factories,  they  have  not  historically  imposed  the  same  measures  on  SMEs, \nmost  of  which  are  noncompliant.  Many  SMEs  lack  the  technical  capability  to treat  highly  toxic \nwastewater  to  meet  the  higher  standards  by  themselves.  Further,  the  investment  and \noperational costs for wastewater treatment equipment are prohibitively high for many SMEs due \nto a lack of economies of scale.11 \n \n7. \nTo address pollution from SMEs, the government has also launched various initiatives to \npromote  eco-industrial  parks,  which  are  specially  accredited  industrial  parks  that  have \nenvironmental  risk  control  measures,  centralize  treatment  of  wastewater,  and  reuse  industrial \nwater.  The  number  of  industrial  parks  accredited  as  eco-industrial  parks  increased  from  2  in \n2001 to 64 in 2014.12 The government\u2019s initiatives have created new business opportunities to \ntreat wastewater for a cluster of SMEs. \n \n8. \nThrough continuous dialogue with stakeholders in the PRC wastewater sector, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  identified  CTEG  as  a  private  sector  pioneer  in  SME  industrial \nwastewater and sludge treatment. The company was confirmed as a viable candidate for ADB \nsupport,  following  a  review  of  its  technical  and  financial  performance,  its  willingness  to  meet \nADB standards, and the potential benefits to the PRC environmental services industry resulting \nfrom the company\u2019s expansion. \n                                                \n6   Government of  the  PRC,  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection.  2014.

CTEG\u2019s  facilities  will  target  SMEs  in  highly  polluting \nindustrial  sectors,  such  as  textile,  paper,  chemical,  and  food  processing.  Treated  wastewater \nwill  be  discharged  according  to  national  environmental  standards  or  supplied  to  industry  for \nreuse in manufacturing. \n \n10. \nidentifying,  evaluating,  selecting,  negotiating, \nimplementing,  and  administering  the  subprojects.  Subprojects  for  ADB  assistance  will  meet \neligibility  criteria  agreed  between  CTEG  and  ADB.  In  selecting  a  location for  each  subproject, \nCTEG  will  evaluate  the  local  government\u2019s  accountability,  and  the  volume  and  quality  of \nwastewater discharged by industries. \n \n\nCTEG  will  be \n\nresponsible \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor and the Borrower \n\n11. \nThe  project  sponsor  and  borrower,  CTEG,  is  a  leading  provider  of  integrated  water \nsolutions  in  the  PRC,  with  businesses  covering  wastewater  treatment,  industrial  water  supply, \nand sludge and solid waste treatment. CTEG was founded as Xi Zhou Enterprises Hong Kong \nin 1999 by Tsui Cham To of Hong Kong, China; the company commenced operations in 2003, \nand  under  Tsui\u2019s  leadership  became  an  early  leader  in  its  industry.  In  anticipation  of  a  stock \nexchange  listing,  in  2010  the  company  was  renamed  as  CTEG  and  established  as  a  holding \ncompany  incorporated  in  the  Cayman  Islands.13 In  2013,  CTEG  was  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong \nStock Exchange.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nCTEG  differentiates  itself  from  peers  in  the  PRC\u2019s  wastewater  treatment  and  water \n12. \nsupply  market  by  focusing  on  industrial  SMEs,  including  customers  in  the  textile,  paper,  and \nfood  processing  sectors. The  company  aggregates  wastewater  discharge from  customers  in  a \nsingle  location,  such  as  an  industrial  park,  and  then  treats  it  using  a  combination  of  chemical \nand biological processes. CTEG employs custom technologies that are adapted to the specific \ncharacteristics  of  its  customers\u2019  effluent. 14  Additionally,  treated  wastewater  is  recycled  to \ncustomers for reuse in manufacturing processes. \n \nAs  of  June  2015,  CTEG  operated  six  industrial  wastewater  treatment  plants  with  total \n13. \ntreatment capacity of 545,000 tons per day, three industrial water supply plants with total supply \ncapacity  of  280,000  tons  per  day,  one  industrial  solid  waste  treatment  plant  with  capacity  of \n2,278 tons per day, two municipal wastewater treatment plants with total treatment capacity of \n120,000 tons  per  day,  three sludge treatment  plants  with total  capacity  of  3,142  tons  per  day, \nand five hazardous waste treatment plants with total capacity of 904 tons per day. \n \n14. \nsince 2012.  \n \n                                                \n13   \n14  To  achieve  the  best  treatment  performance,  CTEG  uses  specialized  equipment  and  technologies  developed  in-\nhouse,  such  as  rotary  solid  removal  equipment,  anaerobic  hydrolysis  tanks,  and  solar-powered  sludge  drying \nsystems. \n\nCTEG  has  demonstrated  rapid  growth  since  its  establishment,  especially  in  the  period \n\n\f4 \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact.  The  project  will  contribute  to  mitigating  water  pollution  from  SMEs,  consistent \n\n15. \nwith goals of the State Council of the PRC (footnote 9). \n \n16. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  SME  industrial  wastewater  and  sludge \nmanagement  through  increased  treatment  of  wastewater  and  sludge.  About  one-third  of  the \ntreated wastewater for SME customers impacted by the project will be reused. \n \n17. \nOutput.  The  output  will  be  the  installation  and  operation  of  SME  industrial  wastewater \nand  sludge  treatment  plants  at  designed  performance  levels.  By  2019,  wastewater  treatment \ncapacity  of  450,000  tons  per  day  (to  meet  the  most  stringent  national  standard 15),  sludge \ntreatment capacity of 4,200 tons per day, and industrial water supply capacity of 240,000  tons \nper  day  will  be  developed.  The  facilities  will  comply  with  ADB  safeguards  and  technical  and \nfinancial eligibility criteria.16 \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nthe  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health \n\nConsistency with  ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \n18. \nof Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and the environment as two of the four strategic \npriorities.17 On infrastructure, the project is in line with the strategy\u2019s focus on water, sanitation, \nand  waste  management,  as  well  as  with  its  emphasis  on  public\u2013private  partnership.  On  the \nthreats  and  promotes \nenvironment, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n \n19. \nConsistency  with  country  partnership  strategy.  By  supporting  inclusive  growth  and \nenvironmental sustainability, the project addresses two of the three development goals of ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC. 18 The  project  aligns  with  the  country  partnership \nstrategy\u2019s  sector  focus  on  environmental  protection,  water  management,  and  pollution  control, \nand strongly complements ADB\u2019s current initiatives in wastewater treatment and water pollution \ncontrol in urban areas, including advisory support. \n \n20. \nConsistency  with  the  water  and  urban  operational  plans.  The  project  aligns  with \nADB\u2019s water policy, which recognizes that remedies to water stress must include reversing the \ndegradation  of  water  resources  caused  by  agricultural,  industrial,  and  municipal  effluents. 19 \nADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  also  identifies  wastewater  management  as  a  key \noperational focus in rapidly industrializing countries like the PRC.20 The project is an example of \nthe type of intervention envisaged by the plan, which promotes water as a core investment area \nand raises ADB\u2019s water investment target to $2.0 billion\u2013$2.5 billion a year by 2020, and targets \nan  additional  $500  million  per  year  for  private  sector  lending.

The  project  is  economically \nviable, as the economic internal rate of return is higher thanthe social discount rate of 12.0%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  to  CTEG  consists  of  (i)  an  A  loan  of  up  to  $100  million \n23. \nequivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii)  a  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $150  million \nequivalent in US dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the A loan from its ordinary capital resources \nand the complementary loan from participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record. The \nA loan will have a maturity of up to 10 years from the date of the facility agreement. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n24. \n\nJustification for ADB involvement in the project is based on the following:  \n(i) \n\nThrough  ADB\u2019s  partnership  with  a  pioneering  company,  the  project  will \ndemonstrate  how  SME  industrial  wastewater  and  sludge  treatment  investments \ncan be commercially and technically viable. ADB\u2019s requirements will ensure that \nCTEG  operates  according  to  best  international  practices  and  adheres  to  high \nstandards of environmental and social management, serving as a model for the \nfuture  private  sector \nindustry.  ADB  assistance  will  build  confidence \nparticipation. \nADB  assistance  will  lower  transaction  costs  by  bundling  multiple  infrastructure \nsubprojects,  which  are  often  too  small  and  time-consuming  for  international \ncommercial banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. ADB will link the cluster of \nsubprojects  with  the  international  financing  community  by  arranging  syndication \nand providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence. \n\nin \n\n(ii) \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\nDemand  risk.  Demand \n\nfor  CTEG\u2019s  services  depends  on \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nlocal  governments\u2019 \n25. \ncommitment  to  develop  industrial  zones  and  to  attract  SMEs  into  such  areas  and  contract  for \nCTEG\u2019s services.  CTEG mitigates this risk by expanding in phases. In addition, ADB loans will \nsupport  subprojects  developed  under  arrangements  that  provide  exclusive  rights  to  provide \nservices in designated areas. Lastly, the recent tightening of environmental discharge standards \nand  enforcement  (para.  6),  and  the  significant  investment  required  for  SMEs  to  build  and \noperate  their  own  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  should  encourage  SMEs  to  outsource \nwastewater treatment to CTEG. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n\f7 \n\n \n26. \nOfftaker  counterparty  risk.  CTEG\u2019s  customers  are  SMEs,  which  pose  increased \ncounterparty risk due to their smaller size and varying credit quality. CTEG\u2019s customers are also \nconcentrated in the highly seasonal textile industry, resulting in volatile cash flows.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n27. \nRegulatory  risk.  The  PRC\u2019s  increased  promotion  of  environmental  protection  and \nsustainable  development  imposes  stricter  regulation  on  industrial  water  pollution.  Policies \nimplemented  nationally  from  2015  significantly  tighten  standards  for  industrial  effluent  quality, \nincrease  pollution  penalties,  and  empower  local  regulators  to  close  noncompliant  factories. \nSince  the  implementation  of  national  regulations  varies  locally  and  regulatory  practices  are \nevolving, the standards and costs under which CTEG operates face some uncertainty. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nSafeguards.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  The  wastewater \n28. \nand  sludge  treatment  services  cater  to  various  SMEs,  particularly  in  textile  industries. \nDewatered sludge is transported to a brick-making facility, which is also operated by CTEG. The \nsites  for  CTEG\u2019s  wastewater  and  sludge  treatment  plants  are  selected  in  coordination  with \nrespective  local  governments.  Since  2003,  the  PRC  has  required  wastewater  and  sludge \ntreatment  plants  to  conduct  a  full  environmental  assessment.  The  facilities  are  to  be  planned \nand  operated  in  full  compliance  with  PRC\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  Potential  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  during  operation  include  effluent  quality,  sludge  management,  noise, \nodor,  and  possible  generation  of  toxic  gases.  Potential  adverse  impacts  associated  with \nconstruction and operation can be mitigated through the adoption of good engineering practices \nand  an  appropriate  environmental  management  plan.  Initial  environmental  examinations \n(including  environmental  management  plans)  will  be  prepared  for  ADB-funded  subprojects  in \naccordance  with  Appendix  1  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  CTEG\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  will  include  environmental  safeguards \nscreening procedures to avoid subprojects with potential to be category A. The subprojects are \ncontingent  on  local  government  plans  for  industrial  development  and  pollution  control;  CTEG \nbids  on  and  secures  specific  subprojects  before  preparing  each  environmental  assessment, \nincluding  the  initial  environmental  examination  requirement  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  identified \nand  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts \nare in the environmental and social audit report, including the corrective action plan. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \n29. \nindigenous peoples. Subprojects will be located in or near industrial zones. As industrial zones \nare  set  up  by  municipal  governments,  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation  are  expected  to  be  insignificant  and,  if  needed,  will  be  carried  out  by  municipal \ngovernments.  The  ESMS  will  reflect  the  resettlement  policy  principles  of  Appendix  2  of  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  will  include  procedures  to  screen  subprojects  that  may  be \neligible for ADB funding. Subprojects with potential to be category A for involuntary resettlement \n\n\f8 \n\nwill  be  excluded.  Should  subprojects  have  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  entailing  physical \nand economic displacement, resettlement plans will be prepared and implemented by municipal \ngovernments  following  PRC  national  laws  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  requirement  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The  ESMS  will  include  social  safeguards \nscreening procedures to avoid adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. Subprojects with potential \nto be category A or category B for impacts on indigenous peoples will be excluded. \n \n30. \nSocial  dimensions. The project is categorized  \u201cno gender elements.\u201d However, CTEG \nwill  undertake gender  analysis  as  part  of  the  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  for \neach subproject, and will involve women in consultation, awareness campaigns, and recruitment. \nCTEG upholds gender equality and provides equal benefits for both men and women. Priorities \nare given to women for certain jobs, such as in the financial and administrative departments and \nlaboratories. The project is not expected to cause any specific cultural or social impact on any \nsocioeconomic  group,  including  women,  or  exclude  women  from  benefiting  from  the  project. \nCTEG  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy \n(2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards.22 \nCTEG will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance with such laws and \n(ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  be \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n31. \nCTEG was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  direct  A  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and \n\n32. \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n33. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 23  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of the PRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to CTEG. ADB will enter \ninto  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n34. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$250,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $100,000,000 \nequivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources;  and  (ii)  a \ncomplementary loan of up to $150,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan to CTEG for the \n\n                                                \n22  ADB. 2003.
