The  loan  is  supporting  the  $223,000,000  capex  and \nexpansion plan of OIL and its subsidiaries (Olam) over the 2017-2019 period and invest in Olam\u2019s \nmidstream  processing  assets  and  permanent  working  capital  for  smallholder  farmer  supply  in \nIndonesia,  Timor-Leste,  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG),  and  Viet  Nam.3 The  project  will  promote \ninclusive and sustainable agricultural value chains with higher local value addition in Southeast \nAsia and the Pacific. The TA subproject will complement the loan by providing capacity building \nsupport to 3,500 smallholder coffee farmers that Olam sources from in Viet Nam.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n\nSubproject Scope \n\nOverall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \nThe TA cluster was approved on 18 December 2017. Subproject 1 was approved on 18 \n2. \nDecember  2018  and  Subproject  2  was  approved  on  10  May  2018.  For  Subproject  1,  the \nrecruitment of the consulting firm is currently underway and the expected commencement date is \n15 February 2020. For Subproject 2, Landell Mills Limited was retained as the consultant. The \ncommencement date for Subproject 2 is 19 November 2018 and the project will be completed by \n14 May 2021.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe TA subproject will help smallholder coffee farmers in Viet Nam fully benefit from their \ninclusion in the coffee value chain by improving the productivity and quality of crops, and meeting \ninternational certification standards. The subproject will also ensure that these farmers are better \nprepared  to  cope  with  the  negative  consequences  of  climate  change.  The  scope  of  the  TA \nsubproject will be limited to the activities of the TA cluster in Viet Nam.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nImpacts and outcome of the TA subproject are in line with the financing project. Impacts \nare:  (i)  double the  agricultural  productivity  and  incomes  of  small-scale  food  producers  through \ninputs, knowledge, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment, (ii) \nensure  sustainable  food  production  systems  and  implement  resilient  agricultural  practices  that \nincrease productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for \nadaptation to climate change, and (iii) significant increase in the exports of developing countries. \nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSubproject Outputs and Activities \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2017.

Improving  productivity  and  price  realization  can  have  a  significant \nimpact on household incomes. However, many smallholder producers are constrained by gaps in \nknowledge and understanding of good agricultural practices, limited financial inclusion, difficulties \nin  accessing  high  quality  inputs  and  technical  advice,  poor  transport  links  and  market \ninfrastructure, and continued dependence on middlemen.  \n \nIn Viet Nam, the consequences of heavy use of fertilizer and other agro-chemicals range from \ndeforestation  and  fishery  resource  depletion,  to  a  growing  incidence  of  land  degradation  and \nwater pollution.7 Climate change is also a growing challenge and poses a serious threat to long \nterm sustainability. Viet Nam has been listed as one of the five countries that will be worst-affected \nby climate change given its high exposure to floods and storms.8  \n \nTA support to households will be anchored on a holistic climate-smart agriculture training program \nincluding  training  sessions,  field  trials,  and  demonstration  plots.  Productivity  and  quality \nimprovement,  environmental  sustainability  of  production,  farmer  organization,  and  household \nfinancial management will be key focus areas, which will help build suppliers\u2019 understanding of \nand  adherence  to  the  Olam  Supplier  Code.9 The  TA  will  help  to  establish  local  level  farmer \nmanaged  demonstration  plots  to  clearly  demonstrate  the  impact  of  specific  farm  management \npractices.  These  demonstration  plots  will  form  part  of  a  broader  network  of  farm  level \ndemonstration plots that is envisaged under Timor-Leste\u2019s coffee sector development plan. They \nwould  be  comparable  to  the  farmer  demonstration  plots  that  have  been  established  by  World \nCoffee Research and aligned with the frameworks and principles that have been established by \nthe Government of Timor-Leste and relevant industry stakeholders.  \n \nTA support to smallholders will be organized and monitored using the Olam farmer management \ninformation system (OFIS), an innovative mobile technology platform that is being developed by \nOlam.  This  will  facilitate  initial  baseline  data  collection  on  household  and  farm  characteristics, \nongoing recording of training and extension activities, periodic surveys of farm conditions to track \nchanges  over  time,  the  development  of  personalized  farm  management  plans,  and  the \nimplementation  of  farm  and  household  level  certifications.  The  deployment  of  OFIS  will  be  a \nsignificant innovation for Timor-Leste and will facilitate rigorous monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nSeveral  steps  will  be  taken  to  maximize the  benefits  of  the  initial  roll-out  of  OFIS.

The knowledge and learning that is emerging from TA activities will \nalso be regularly shared with other industry stakeholders. This will help to leverage the impact of \nTA activities by facilitating information exchange between sector stakeholders and encouraging \nbroader uptake of successful approaches.  \n \nThe  TA  will  also encourage  institution  building  and  establishment  of  industry  standards  in  Viet \nNam through the development of coffee grading systems and unified information management \nsystem. The TA is a piggyback TA which will help realize the projected impact of the financing \nproject. The TA will help farmers be included in the global coffee supply chain by helping them \nadopt sustainable farming practices and increasing their production and quality, and ultimately, \nincome. \n\nScope of Service \n\nA. \n \nThe project will be designed around the registration of 3,500 new farmers into the Olam Farmer \nInformation System (OFIS). This requires building on-the-gournd relationships with farmers and \ncollecting data through a baseline and annual surveys. Information collected should be used to \ndesign  training  programs  including  Good  Agricultural  Practices,  Integrated  Pest  Management, \nand Climate Smart Agriculture. The setting up and running of a series of coffee demo plots will \nprovide accurate information on local coffee growing conditions, thus informing training content \nand providing training sites for farmers.  \n \nFarm level demonstration plots will be broadly modelled a World Coffee Research methodology \nbeing used locally, with the following characteristics:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nLocated on individual farmers\u2019 land and broadly representative of size / growing \nconditions faced by other farmers in the immediate vicinity;  \nManaged  according  to  a  design  that  is  centrally  coordinated  and  that  involves \n\u2018side-by-side\u2019 application of different treatments / practices.  \nSupported by careful data collection and monitoring to enable clear evaluation of \nthe economic returns of different \u2018improvements\u2019 or changes in farming practices.  \nProviding  clear  visual  evidence  to  nearby  farmers,  and  micro-data  for  more \naggregated analysis.  \n \n\nOFIS will be used to generate individual farm management plans and the project will supply inputs \nand advice to implement these effectively. Improvements in productivity, coffee quality and farmer \nlivelihoods are key measures of success. (Organic) certification and/or OLC certification may be \nuseful tools for delivering/measuring these.  \n \nThe firm will report to the ADB project officer through the assignment team leader and will perform \nthe following: \n \n1. \n\nOutput 1: Inclusive coffee supply chain established \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSupport  quality  improvements  and  market  linkages  (certification  if  appropriate) \nleading to livelihood improvements of new farmers: 3,500 in Viet Nam.  \nPilot smallholder specialty coffee traceability program in 10 cooperatives or farmer \ngroups in Viet Nam.  \nFarmer-to-farmer best practice exchanges facilitated by training farmer-instructors: \n200 in Viet Nam. \nTraining of farmers on gender inclusion and elimination of child labor: 3,500 in Viet \nNam. \nTraining of famers in financial literacy: 3,500 in Viet Nam.10 \n\n(v) \n \nOutput  2:  Environmentally  sustainable  and  climate  resilient  supply  chain \nestablished \n(i) \n\npractices \n\nin  good \n\nagricultural \n\nTraining in climate smart agriculture11 to farmers, including (i) adaptation strategy \nfor temperature increase and precipitation change, (ii) water harvesting and drip \nirrigation, and (iii) conservation agriculture: 6,500 in Timor-Leste.  \nTraining \n(i) \nfarmers, \nreplanting/rejuvenation,  (ii)  pruning,  (iii)  integrated  pest  management,  (iv) \nintercropping, and (v) harvest and post-harvest solutions: 6,500 in Timor-Leste. \nEstablishment of a network of 50 trial and demonstration plots across the central, \ndistrict, and village levels to test and demonstrate appropriate methodologies for \nrehabilitation,  replanting,  pruning,  composting  and  soil  management  and \nintegrated pest management.  \nDevelop and provide training for 1,000 farmers in: (i) innovative technologies for \nresources  conservation,  (ii)  innovative  technologies  for  climate  adaptation,  (iii) \nsustainable use of agri-chemicals and organic inputs, and (iv) pollution control. \n\nincluding \n\nto \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(ii) \n\n \nOutput 3: Smallholder coffee farmer access to information and services expanded  \nEnroll  all  participating  farm  households  (total  3,500)  in  the  Olam  Farmer \n(i) \nInformation  System  (OFIS)  and  complete  baseline  and  periodic  farm  surveys, \nrecord ongoing training and farmer support, and personalized farm management \nplans to all participating households.   \nProvide  an  \u2018OFIS  Window\u2019  -  a  data  platform  giving  transparency  on  project \nactivities  and  progress  and  hold  regular  knowledge  sharing  sessions  with \ngovernment and industry stakeholders. \nCoordination with selected external partners on design and implementation of a \nstructured evaluation of different training approaches and methodologies;  \nAssessment  of  overall  project  impacts  by  analyzing  household  income  and \nlivelihood data from OFIS and other relevant data sources.   \n \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nThis assignment is for Timor-Leste only. However, under the Project, three similar assignments \nare  expected.  Each  project  country  (i.e.,  Timor-Leste,  PNG,  Viet  Nam,  Indonesia)  will  have  a \nseparate contract. For efficiency, consulting firms are encouraged to bid for more than one of the \nfour contacts. \n \nB. \n\nKey Expertise Required \n \n\n \n\n10 At least 25% women.  \n11 Identification of current and projected climate risks for smallholder coffee farmers and mapping of risks to proposed \n\nadaptation strategy and training is part of this output. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n \nProposing entities are provided with the flexibility to structure and organize the project team, and \ndetermine the number and nature of any additional team members required to deliver the project \nobjectives  and  outputs.
