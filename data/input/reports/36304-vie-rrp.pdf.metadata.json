An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nand a summary environmental analysis is a core appendix. \n \nThe project scope includes (i) client-oriented agricultural research \nand  capacity  strengthening,  (ii)  grassroots  agricultural  extension \nimprovement,  and  (iii)  rural-based \ntechnical  and  vocational \ntraining.  Activities  will  focus  on  effective  management  and \ndissemination  of  agriculture  science  and  technology  (AST)  to \npromote production and marketing of agricultural and agro-based \nproducts.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  and  modernize  the  AST \ntheir  staff, \nsystem  and \nresearchers, and other stakeholders in planning and implementing \nadvanced  AST  activities.  Improvements  in  key  AST  areas, \nincluding  agricultural  research,  extension,  and  training,  will  be \nevidenced  by  more  client-oriented  AST  activities  with  improved \nmechanisms \ntechnology \nfor  participatory  and  pro-poor \ndissemination  that  reflect  demand  in  the  field;  and  improved \nphysical  and  human  resources  for  the  AST  system  with  effective \ncommunication  and  collaboration  between  public  and  private \nsector  organizations.  Project  activities  related  to  agricultural \nextension will mainly cover upland or remote areas in five selected \nprovinces  in  line  with  the  country  strategy  and  program  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Viet  Nam.  Other  project \nactivities will have nationwide coverage. \n \nDuring 1995\u20132005, the agriculture sector in Viet Nam grew rapidly \nat  an  average  annual  rate  of  4.1%,  and  contributed  to  the \ncountry\u2019s  overall  annual  economic  growth  of  7.2%.  From  a  net \nimporter  of  rice  in  the  late  1980s,  Viet  Nam  has  become  one  of \nthe largest rice exporters in the world, and exports large quantities \nof  commercial  crops,  including  coffee,  rubber,  tea,  pepper, \ngroundnuts,  and  cashews.  As  part  of  the  10-year  National \nSocioeconomic  Development  Strategy \nto \nsustain  growth,  employment,  and  exports  in  agriculture  to  help \nfoster \nreduce  rural  poverty, \nagricultural diversification into higher value products and markets; \n(ii) \nand \nproductivity, \nagroprocessing;  (iii)  improve  product  quality  for  domestic  and \ntechnology  development  and \nexport  markets;  (iv) \n\nthe  Government  plans \n\n(2001\u20132010)  and \n\naddition, \n\nincrease \n\nfacilitate \n\nto  (i) \n\nfactor \n\nvalue \n\n\fii \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\ntechnologies  need \n\ndissemination  through  improved  research  and  extension;  and \n(v) increase  rural  industries,  infrastructure,  and  services.  The \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) formulated \nits 5-year plan for 2006\u20132010 to ensure sustainable and equitable \ngrowth of the agriculture sector and prepare for the country\u2019s rapid \nintegration  into  international  markets.  To  achieve  these  policy \nobjectives, more effective use of AST is required for technological \nadvancement,  which  will  ensure \nfood  security;  promote \nagricultural  diversification;  and  improve  the  quality  of  high-value \ncrop,  livestock,  and  fishery  products  that  are  comparable  with \nneighboring  countries  and  trade  competitors.  Access  to  new \ntechnologies  by  farmers  and  agro-based  enterprises  is  essential \nas  Viet  Nam's  agriculture  is  gradually  shifting  its  focus  from \nincreased  production  volumes  to  increased  production  values  by \nidentifying new production processes and innovative products and \nmarketing.  These \nto  be  developed  and \ndisseminated  in  partnership  with  central  and  provincial  agencies \nof the Government, private enterprises, farmers, and international \nagricultural research institutions. \n \nMajor  policy  and  structural  weaknesses  in  agricultural  research, \nextension,  training,  and  market  information  systems  in  the  public \nsector are being addressed under the ongoing Agriculture Sector \nDevelopment  Program.  Successful  reforms  in  these  institutions \nwill require investments in human resources and infrastructure for \nAST  that  will  enable  them  to  contribute  more  significantly  to \nagricultural growth in a changing global environment. The Project \nwill  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for \nViet Nam,  which  aims  at  supporting  the  country's  sustainable \neconomic growth by raising agricultural productivity and promoting \nprivate agroenterprises. The Project will complement the ongoing \nand  planned  activities  of  other  external  funding  agencies  and \nnongovernment organizations, and has been formulated based on \nthe \nthe  relevant  agricultural  research \ninstitutes,  organizations  involved  in  agricultural  extension,  and \nMARD\u2019s technical and vocational training schools. \n \nThe Project will contribute to the national goal of economic growth \nand poverty reduction by achieving the sustainable and equitable \ngrowth  of  the  agriculture  sector.  The  Project  aims  to  strengthen \nthe  capacity  of  the  national  AST  system.  The  advanced  AST \nsystem  will  facilitate  technology  development  and  dissemination, \nimprove  the  quality  of  agricultural  products  for  domestic  and \nexport markets, and increase their competitiveness. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $40  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $2.62 million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ninvestment  needs  of \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\n \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\niii \n\nSource \n \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n30.0 \n10.0 \n40.0 \n\n% \n \n75.0 \n25.0 \n100.0 \n\n \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n \nA loan of Special Drawing Rights 20,198,000 equivalent from the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  of  ADB  will  be  provided,  with  a  term  of \n32 years including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n \n30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\nin \n\nthe  province, \n\n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n \nMARD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation. \nMARD  will  establish  a  central  project  management  unit  in  its \nAgricultural Project Management Board. The unit, to be headed by \na  project  director,  will  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  of  the \nProject and ensure interdepartmental coordination within MARD at \nthe  central  level  under  appropriate  technical  guidance  of  the \nDepartment  of  Science  and  Technology,  and  other  concerned \ndepartments  of  MARD.  Before  loan  effectiveness,  a  provincial \nproject  management  unit  will  be  established  under  the  provincial \ndepartment  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  in  each  of  the \nfive  project  provinces.  The  unit  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nmanagement  and  supervision  of  the  project  activities  related  to \nagricultural  extension \nincluding  contractual \narrangements for service delivery, finance and project accounting, \nprocurement,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  reporting.  Before \nloan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  also  establish  a  project \nsteering committee to be headed by the vice minister of MARD in \ncharge  of  science  and  technology  to  facilitate  interministerial \ncoordination  and  provide  overall  guidance \nfor  project \nimplementation. \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  from  the \nproceeds of the loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines, and the procurement plan as agreed and \namended \nthe  relevant \nGovernment  procedures  and  regulations.  Supply  contracts  and \ncivil  works  under  the  Project  will  be  limited  in  size;  and  be \nawarded through shopping, national competitive bidding, or direct \ncontracting procedures according to the estimated contract value, \nand to ensure that procured contracts are reasonably priced and \nsuitable  for  project  activities,  and  that  fair  canvassing  is  done \namong suppliers. \n\ntime,  and  will \n\nfollow \n\nfrom \n\ntime \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nThe  Project  will  require  a  team  of  consultants,  including  29 \nperson-months of international and 96 person-months of national \nconsultants  in  the  fields  of  agricultural  research  management, \nagricultural  extension  management,  agricultural  vocational \ntraining, social development, environmental assessment, financial \nmanagement,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  An  international \nconsulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  provide  these  services.  The \nin \nselection  and  engagement  of  consultants  will  be  done \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nthe procurement plan as agreed and amended from time to time. \nThe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used,  and \nsimplified technical proposals invited from the short-listed firms. \n \nSpecial  attention  will  be  paid  to  social  issues  related  to  gender \nand  beneficiaries  in  the  project  provinces,  including  ethnic \nthe  project \nminorities  and  environmental \nactivities.  A  multistakeholder  participatory  diagnosis  and  design \napproach  was  adopted  for  project  preparation  to  disseminate \nfindings  and  project  design.  Key  stakeholders,  including  relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  research  institutes,  local  administrations, \nfarmer groups, other external funding agencies, and international \nnongovernment  organizations,  were  consulted  during  project \nformulation.  These  stakeholders  strongly  support  the  project \nconcept  and  recognize  the  importance  of  improved  AST  in \nViet Nam. \n \n\nissues  related \n\nto \n\nto  strengthening \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major  assumptions  for  effective  project  implementation  include \nthe \n(i) continued  Government  commitment \nnational  AST  system  and  to  creating  a  favorable  policy  and \ninstitutional  environment  for  the  market-oriented  growth  of  the \nagriculture sector, (ii) adequate provision of counterpart resources \nfor  maintaining  sustainable  project  operations,  and  (iii)  active \nparticipation  of  key  stakeholders  in  planning  and  implementing \ngrassroots extension services. \n \nConcerns  are  often  raised  about  the  possible  risk  that  research-\nled  technological  advances  in  agriculture  may  benefit  wealthy \nfarmers  at  the  expense  of  poor  farmers.  Wealthier  farmers  may \nhave more resources to apply new technologies. However, access \nto agricultural science and technology is also critical for improving \npoor  farmers\u2019  income  and  livelihood.  In  this  context,  special \nmeasures  must  be  included  to  identify  farmers\u2019  needs  in  poor \ncommunities. Under the Project, the selection criteria for research \nand  extension  contracts  and  demonstration  trials  will  have  pro-\npoor elements to reflect local farmers\u2019 needs, and give priority to \nsocially  sensitive  activities  in  the  provincial  agricultural  extension \nplans  with  regard  to  participation  of  women  and  ethnic  minority \ngroups.  These  criteria  will  be  rigorously  applied  to  ensure  a \npositive impact on poverty reduction. \n \nOther  project  risks  may  include  (i)  inadequate  provision  of \ncounterpart  resources  for  the  project  facilities,  (ii)  weak  linkages \n\n\fbetween agricultural research and extension, and (iii) inadequate \nstakeholder  participation  in  project  planning  and  implementation. \nThe  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  it  will  provide  adequate \ncounterpart  staff  and  resources  to  maintain  sustainability  of  the \nthe \nproject \nGovernment  to  ensure  adequate  financial  resources  for  the \nupgraded  equipment  and \nlinkage \nbetween  research  and  extension,  and  continue  the  project \napproach to promote active stakeholder participation. \n \n\nimpact.

The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  in  Viet  Nam  was  estimated  at  $622  in \n2005,  an  increase  of  more  than  20%  from  2004.  Poverty  rapidly  decreased  during  the  last \ndecade from 58% in the early 1990s to 23% in 2004.1 Progress toward the country\u2019s Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  and  targets  has  been  fast;  achieving  poverty  reduction  targets  ahead  of \nschedule is making attainment of social development goals feasible. However, despite the rapid \nreduction  in  overall  poverty  incidence,  poverty  still  remains  a  critical  issue  particularly  in  rural \nareas where about 75% of the country\u2019s population lives. Severe poverty exists in upland and \nremote  areas  and  the  gap  in  income  between  urban  and  rural  areas  is  rapidly  increasing. \nPoverty is particularly high in rural areas in the central region where increased efforts for rural \ndevelopment are required. \n \n3. \nDuring  1995\u20132005,  the  agriculture  sector  in  Viet  Nam,  including  crops,  livestock, \nfisheries,  and  forestry,  expanded  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  4.1%.  In  2005,  the  total \nproduction  value  of  the  sector  was  estimated  at  D175.0  trillion  ($10.9  billion)  or  about  21%  of \nthe  national  GDP.2  The  agriculture  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction, accounting for about 30% of the total export value and about 60% of the labor \nforce. More  than 50% of agricultural production value comes from the  Red River and Mekong \nRiver deltas. Sector's growth in 2005 was estimated at about 4.0%. \n \n4. \nIn 2004, about 7.4 million hectares (ha) or 57% of the total cropped area of 12.9 million \nha  was  under  rice  cultivation  mainly  in  the  two  delta  areas.  Total  paddy  production  was \nestimated  at  about  34.6  million  tons  with  average  yield  of  about  4.7  tons  per  ha.  Other  major \ncrops  include  maize  (910,000  ha),  fruits  (747,000  ha),  vegetables  (606,000  ha),  cassava \n(372,000 ha), sugarcane (306,000 ha), and groundnuts (243,000 ha). Perennial industrial crops \ninclude coffee (514,000 ha), rubber (437,000 ha), and pepper (50,000 ha). Viet Nam was a net \nimporter of rice in the late 1980s, but has become one of the largest rice exporters in the world, \nand also exports large quantities of commercial crops. This rapid growth is mainly attributed to \nthe  market-oriented  reforms  that  recognize  farm  households  as  the  key  unit  of  production, \nliberalized  land  use  rights  and  decision  making  on  production  and  marketing,  and  increased \ninvestment  in  irrigation  development  and  rehabilitation.  Improved  agriculture  science  and \ntechnology  (AST)  also  played  an  important  role,  though  its  focus  was  more  on  increasing  the \nquantity of production and less on the aspect of product quality and marketing. \n \n5. \nWith  globalization,  the  agricultural  setting  is  changing  rapidly.  Trade  in  agricultural \nproducts is becoming diverse, and the technological base for agriculture is increasingly built on \nadvanced  AST.  Information  technologies  contribute  to  improvements  in  agricultural  production \nand marketing. The private sector has taken a larger role in the generation and diffusion of new \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. \n2  The  figures  for  2005  are  preliminary  estimates  obtained  from  the  General  Statistics  Office  of  the  Government  of \n\nViet Nam. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntechnologies  for  seeds,  agrochemicals,  and  veterinary  medicines.  In  particular,  multinational \nenterprises operate in various agricultural input and output markets. Under this global situation, \nincreased production volume by itself cannot enhance the contribution of the agriculture sector \nto the national economy. Accompanying growth in production values through improvements in \nproduct  quality  and  marketing  is  essential  to  ensure  sustainable  agricultural  growth.  In  this \ncontext, strengthening of the country\u2019s AST system is urgently required. \n \n6. \nThe  AST  system  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  highly  fragmented  and  characterized  by \nduplication  of  efforts  and  programs.  The  ongoing  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program \n(ASDP)3 addresses major structural weaknesses in AST, including (i) overlapping functions and \nuneven  geographic  distribution  of  research  institutes,  (ii)  inadequate  capacity  of  extension \nservices in disseminating improved technology and research outputs, and (iii) ineffective support \nfor  agro-industrial  development.  In  March  2003,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assisted \nthe  Government  in  formulating  a  road  map  for  AST,4  which  calls  for  (i)  detailed  analysis  and \ninventory  assessments  of  the  AST  system,  (ii)  increased  emphasis  on  client-oriented \nagricultural  research  and  extension,  (iii)  coordination  and  partnership  with  key  stakeholders  in \npublic  and  private  sectors,  and  (iv)  provision  of  comprehensive  and  quality  services  with \nincreased focus on poor and disadvantaged farm households. The road map also stresses the \nneed  for  increased  investment  in  improving  physical  and  human  resources  for  AST.  The \nproposed  AST  Project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Viet  Nam, \nand  fully  takes  into  account  the  reform  measures  implemented  under  the  ASDP  and  the  main \nthrust of the road map. \n \n7. \nIn  Viet  Nam,  the  major  contribution  of  AST  in  the  1990s  was  as  a  spillover  from  the \naccumulated  benefits  of  agricultural  research  and  development  undertaken  elsewhere.  This \nresulted in the increased use of fertilizer and machinery. This source of growth will continue, but \nthe  need  for  new  technology  adapted  to  the  country\u2019s  specific  agroecological  conditions  will \nincrease. To become a significant source of agricultural growth, the national AST system needs \nto  be  modernized  and  become  more  effective.  This  will  require  capacity  strengthening  with \nimproved equipment and facilities, and upgraded skills and capacity of human resources. It will \nalso  require  new  systems  and  management  approaches,  increasing  the  focus  on  the  local \nneeds  of  farmers  and  traders  through  client-oriented  management  of  AST  resources  and \ninstitutions. A more detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy \n\n8. \nAs part of the National 10-Year Socioeconomic Development Strategy (2001\u20132010), the \nGovernment plans to (i) foster agricultural diversification into higher value products and markets; \n(ii) increase factor productivity, value addition, and agroprocessing; (iii) improve product quality \nfor  domestic  and  export  markets;  (iv)  facilitate  technology  development  and  dissemination \nthrough  improved  research  and  extension;  (v)  increase  rural  industries,  infrastructure,  and \nservices;  and  (vi)  reduce  rural-urban  income  gaps.  The  Government  strongly  recognizes  that \nmore  effective  use  of  AST  is  required  for  technological  advancement,  which  will  ensure  food \nsecurity,  promote  agricultural  diversification,  and  improve  the  quality  of  high-value  agriculture \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nand agro-based products that are comparable with neighboring countries and trade competitors. \nImprovement of the national AST system is one of the highest priority policy issues. \n \n9. \nMARD  formulated  its  new  5-year  plan  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan  (2006-2010)  to  ensure  sustainable  and  equitable  growth  of  the  agriculture \nsector in view of the country\u2019s rapid integration into international markets through its entry into \nthe World Trade Organization and the implementation of the Free Trade Area Agreement of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. The new plan will aim to (i) modernize the agriculture \nsector;  (ii)  strengthen  AST;  (iii) increase  investment  in  the  improvement  of  postharvest \noperations and biotechnology; (iv) promote agricultural trade and marketing; and (v) strengthen \nthe  system  of  sector  management,  thereby  increasing  agricultural  household  income,  and \nensuring sustainable and equitable sector growth. \n \n10. \nTo  achieve  these  sector  objectives,  the  Project  will  address  the  existing  sector \nconstraints  in  agricultural  research,  extension,  and  rural-based  training  through  effective \ninvestment in the national AST system, which has been significantly low in Viet Nam (0.1% of \nagricultural GDP) as compared with Thailand (1.4%) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (0.4%). \nTo  promote  production  and  marketing  of  high-value  and  high-quality  agricultural  products, \naccess  of  farmers  and  agro-based  enterprises  to  advanced  AST  and  related  knowledge  and \nskills must be improved. In this context, the Project is critically important for strengthening the \nnational AST system. \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Agriculture Science and Technology System \n\nIn Viet Nam, the national AST system for agricultural research, extension and training is \n11. \ncomplex,  involving  six  ministries:  MARD,  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  Ministry  of \nEducation  and  Training,  Ministry  of  Industry,  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  and  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment. This complex system is the result of various institutional changes \nin the agriculture sector since the 1970s. The Government fully recognizes the weaknesses of \nthe  existing  AST  system  due  to  (i)  complex  organizational  structures;  (ii)  old  facilities  and \nobsolete  equipment;  (iii)  inadequate  budgetary  allocations  for  carrying  out  advanced  AST \nprograms and for upgrading equipment and facilities; (iv) lack of coordination among agencies \nand institutes, and duplication of efforts on similar topics; (v) lack of effective linkages between \nresearch and extension, and other support services; and (vi) uneven regional distribution of staff \nand facilities concentrated in the two delta regions. These issues often lead to a waste of scarce \npublic  resources  for  a  variety  of  AST  activities,  weak  institutional  capacities,  and  lack  of \nfeedback from producers and traders. \n \n12. \nUnder the ASDP, MARD initiated policy and institutional reform measures related to the \nnational AST system, including (i) reorganization of the national agricultural research system to \nrationalize  the  existing  mandates  and  resources  of  research  institutes,  (ii)  comprehensive \nrevision of the Government decree on agricultural extension to institutionalize participatory and \npro-poor agricultural extension services, and (iii) strengthening of provincial agricultural market \ninformation systems. The Government\u2019s approval and implementation of these measures were \ncritical milestone events in the AST system as they actually led to the commencement of long-\nawaited reforms in the system. This process is still in transition, and formal ministerial circulars \nand regulations to institutionalize the reorganized system are being prepared with technical and \nadvisory  support  of  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA).5  These  ongoing  reforms  are  expected  to \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

A \nmore detailed description of the issues related to the national AST system, and rationale for the \nproposed investment are included in the sector analysis in Appendix 2. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Policy and Operational Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  policy  on  agriculture  and  natural  resources  research6  aims  to  contribute  to \n13. \n(i) poverty  reduction,  (ii)  sustainable  management  of  agriculture  and  natural  resources,  and \n(iii) increased  agricultural  productivity.  The  policy  highlights  the  need  for  integrated  farming \nsystems  with  diversified  crops;  provision  of  support  for  farming  in  unfavorable  environments, \nincluding  upland  and  remote  areas;  and  technology  development  and  natural  resources \nmanagement based on stakeholder participation. The Project includes a number of features that \nare in line with the agenda of the ADB policy to strengthen the national AST system in Viet Nam \nas described in the project components (paras. 21\u221237). \n \n14. \nThe  Project  was  formulated  based  on  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for  Viet  Nam,  approved  in  January \n2002,7  and  subsequent  updates,  which  highlighted  the  country\u2019s  need  for  rural  development \nthrough  improved  agricultural  productivity  and  diversification  as  an  important  measure  to \nachieve  the  CSP\u2019s  strategic  objectives.  The  Project  is  included  in  the  CSP  update  for  2006\u2013\n2008, and in line with the new CSP (2007\u20132010) for Viet Nam (footnote 1), approved in October \n2006, which aims at pro-poor economic growth. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nUntil  the  end  of  2004,  according  to  the  MARD  database,  external  funding  agencies, \n15. \nincluding  ADB,  committed  about  $2.14  billion  to  assist  the  agriculture  sector  in  Viet  Nam,  of \nwhich about $0.82 billion was in grant funds and $1.32 billion in loans. As of 31 December 2005, \nADB  provided  20  loans  to  agriculture,  irrigation,  fisheries, and  rural  development  in  Viet  Nam, \namounting to $892 million or 26% of the total loans to the country of about $3.4 billion. ADB has \nbeen  active  in  supporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  sector  through  ASDP,  and  in \nsupporting  projects  for  rural  finance,  and  irrigation  and  flood  control.  Other  external  funding \nagencies  in  the  sector  include  those  of  Australia,  Denmark,  Japan,  and  Netherlands; \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development;  and  World  Bank.  ADB  is  active  in  ensuring \nadequate coordination with other multilateral and bilateral funding agencies through its Viet Nam \nResident Mission. These external funding agencies and international research institutions will be \nregularly briefed on project implementation during loan review missions and regular dialogue on \nsector issues related to the ASDP. Appendix 3 shows recent initiatives of major external funding \nagencies in the agriculture sector. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\n16. \nAs of the end of December 2005, ADB had seven ongoing loans in the agriculture and \nnatural resources sector. The progress of the ongoing ASDP is satisfactory with releases of the \nfirst  and  second  tranches  of  the  program  loan  despite  an  initial  delay  in  the  program  start-up. \nOverall  portfolio  performance  in  Viet  Nam  was  less  encouraging  in  2004  with  implementation \ndelays.  Generic  implementation  issues  in  the  country  include  lengthy  decision-making \nprocesses  and  inadequate  number  of  well-qualified  and  competent  project  management  staff. \nThese  issues  are  being  addressed  jointly  with  the  World  Bank  and  other  external  funding \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1995.

The  program \nperformance  audit  report  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program  loan,8  which  was  rated  as \nsuccessful,  is  very  relevant  and  provides  important  lessons  learned  for  the  proposed  Project, \nincluding the need for (i) better focus in the project scope for agricultural support services, and \n(ii)  gradual  sector  reforms  accompanied  by  timely  provision  of  financial  and  TA  assistance. \nThese  contributed  to  general  success  in  introducing  changes  in  the  agriculture  sector.  The \nproposed Project is fully in line with this approach to accompany Government sector reforms. \n \nLessons from other projects of ADB and other external funding agencies mainly relate to \n18. \nthe  need  for  stronger  linkages  between  research  and  extension,  and  for  enhanced  project \nreadiness.  These  lessons  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  proposed  project \ncomponents  will  be  implemented  with  improved  linkages  between  agricultural  research  and \nextension and other support services at various stages through participation of key stakeholders \nin  work  planning  and  implementation  of  the  Project,  and  in  the  selection  of  research  and \nextension  proposals  to  be  funded  under  the  Project.  These  measures  will  ensure  that  client \ndemand is reflected in the project activities for agricultural research and extension. To enhance \nproject  readiness,  advance  action  for  consultant  recruitment  was  taken,  and  the  TA  for \nstrengthening  managerial  capacity  of  the  staff  involved  in  the  national  AST  system  was \nmobilized prior to loan approval (footnote 5). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  strengthen  the  national  AST  system  in  Viet  Nam,  thereby \n19. \ncontributing  to  the  sustainable  and  equitable  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  ultimately  to \nreduced  rural  poverty.  The  Project  will  address  critical  issues  involved  in  AST  development, \nincluding the low level of linkages among key AST areas (agricultural research, extension, and \ntraining),  and  the  gap  in  the  capacity  of  physical  and  human  resources  for  the  national  AST \nsystem.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  resolution  of  these  issues  and  increase  the \neffectiveness  and  relevance  of  AST  activities  for  clients  to  receive  benefits  of  improved  AST, \nand  promote  on-farm  and  off-farm  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources.  Inclusion  of  the  three \nkey  AST  areas  under  the  Project  as  part  of  the  integrated  national  system  is  vital  if  the  full \npotential of AST development is to be realized. \n \n20. \nThe  project  scope  will  cover  (i)  client-oriented  agricultural  research  and  capacity \nstrengthening, (ii) grassroots agricultural extension improvement, and (iii) rural-based technical \nand  vocational  training.  The  activities  will  be  undertaken  through  close  linkages  among  the \ncomponents.  Activities  related  to  extension  will  mainly  cover  upland  or  remote  areas  in  five \nprovinces,  including  Dak  Nong,9  Nghe  An,  Ninh  Thuan,  Quang  Nam,  and  Thanh  Hoa,  while \nother  project  components  have  nationwide  coverage.  Specific  project  outcomes  will  include \n(i) improved  capacity  of  physical  and  human  resources  for  agricultural  research,  (ii)  increased \n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2002. Program Performance Audit Report on the Agriculture Sector Program in Viet Nam. Manila (PPA: VIE \n\n25325). \n\n9   The  Government  of  Denmark  is  currently  formulating  a  follow-up  project  to  its  ongoing  Agriculture  Sector \nProgramme Support activities in several provinces including Dak Nong; the activities are expected to have strong \nsynergy with the proposed ADB Project. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nresponsiveness of agricultural research activities to client needs, (iii) improved farmer access to \nparticipatory  and  pro-poor  agricultural  extension  services,  (iv)  strengthened  linkages  between \nagricultural research and extension, (v) increased responsiveness of rural-based technical and \nvocational  training  to  national  sector  goals,  and  (vi)  strengthened  capacity  of  rural-based \nagricultural training. The project scope has been carefully designed to avoid overlapping, and be \ntechnically complementary to the ongoing policy and institutional reforms under the ASDP. The \ndesign and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nClient-Oriented Agricultural Research and Capacity Strengthening \n\nThis  component  will  support  (i)  client-oriented  research  programs,  (ii)  training  and \n21. \npostgraduate  programs  for  staff  involved  in  agricultural  research,  and  (iii)  upgrading  of \nlaboratory equipment of selected agricultural research institutes. \n \nClient-Oriented  Research  Programs.  The  Project  will  promote  agricultural  research \n22. \nprograms and timely application of research results to clients\u2019 practical uses. Prior to start-up of \nthis activity, MARD, the Executing Agency for the Project, will establish a committee to examine \nand  select  research  proposals  for  project  funding  on  a  competitive  basis.  The  committee  is \nproposed  to  have  a  total  of  11  members,  representing  MARD\u2019s  Science  and  Technology \nCouncil,  other  relevant  government  and  non-government  agencies,  including  agro-enterprises \nand rural associations. \n \nThe  research  proposals  to  be  funded  under  the  Project  need  to  focus  mainly  on \n23. \nknowledge,  information,  and  technologies  relevant  to  the  agroecological  regions  serviced  by \nregional research institutes, and must be clearly in line with the selection criteria to reflect client \nneeds,  strategic  relevance,  and  sustainability  (para.  70  [ii]).  A  scoring  system  to  emphasize \nsocial  and  pro-poor  aspects,  and  promotion  of  environmentally  sustainable  agricultural  and \nnatural resource management systems, will be adopted. Although research subjects on upland \nand remote areas will be covered mainly by public institutes, private sector institutions can also \napply  for  the  program.  The  proposals  need  to  involve  at  least  one  provincial  agricultural \nextension  center  (PAEC)  or  extension  advisory  council  as  a  coapplicant  to  ensure  a  linkage \nbetween  research  and  extension.10  The  maximum  amount  of  a  research  proposal  will  be \n$100,000. Reasonable laboratory or office equipment to undertake the proposed research can \nbe  included  in  the  proposal.  This  activity  is  complementary  to  the  ongoing  Collaboration  for \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development  Program  financed  by  the  Government  of  Australia,  which \ndelivers large-scale and advanced agricultural research programs through a competitive bidding \nsystem. Coordination through the committee established for the Project will avoid the selection \nof repetitive and duplicative research proposals. \n \n24. \nTraining  of  Research  Staff.  To  address  the  shortage  of  qualified  research  staff,  the \nProject  will  provide  on-the-job  training  and  postgraduate  and  postdoctoral  study  programs  for \nthe staff of agricultural research institutes and other institutions of the national AST system. The \npurpose  of  the  on-the-job  training  is  to  effectively  utilize  the  existing  and  proposed  laboratory \nequipment  and  facilities,  and  improve  staff  knowledge  and  skills  to  manage  sophisticated \nfacilities. During the first year of the Project, the Project\u2019s consultant team will conduct a needs \n\n                                                 \n10 The field survey carried out during project formulation indicates farmers\u2019 strong demand for reliable information on \nagricultural research results and improved technology from regional and central research institutes and extension \nservices.  \n\n\f7 \n\nassessment  for  on-the-job  training.  The  assessment  will  build  on  the  inventory  of  existing \nequipment and facilities compiled during project formulation under the project preparatory TA,11 \nMARD\u2019s  2003  equipment  utilization  survey,  and  additional  questionnaires  to  be  given  to \nselected  institutions.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  assessment,  MARD  will  identify  the  subjects \nand formulate proposals for the type and duration of on-the-job training programs. \n \n25. \nThe Project will finance overseas study programs in key areas of agricultural research, \nincluding agricultural biotechnology, postharvest technology, product preservation for fruits and \nvegetables,  economic  policy  and  marketing,  and  natural  resources  management.  No  specific \nquota will be assigned to any of these subject areas or institutes. The application and selection \nprocesses will follow MARD\u2019s existing procedures, and a selection committee will be established \nwith  the  participation  of  Science  and  Technology  Council  members,  other  relevant  ministries, \nand  key  stakeholders.  The  specific  selection  of  trainees  is  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The \noverseas study programs will support 20 trainees for doctoral courses for 3 years, 15 trainees \nfor master\u2019s courses for 2 years, and 20 trainees for postdoctoral programs for 1 year. At least \n10% of the total trainees will be women. To ensure that these study programs will be completed \nduring the project period, applications will be invited in the first and second years of the Project \nfor  commencement  in  the  following  years.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  overseas  study \nprograms to be funded under the Project will be carried out in a manner acceptable to ADB. In \nparticular, the Government will ensure that appropriate arrangements are developed so that the \ntrainees will provide relevant services after returning from the programs. Such arrangements will \nbe  developed  in  consultation  with  ADB  prior  to  implementation  of  the  study  programs.  The \nhuman  resource  development  plan  for  agricultural  research  was  formulated  under  the  ASDP \nand  approved  by  MARD  in  October  2005.  The  proposed  training  program  for  researchers  will \ncontribute  to  implementation  of  the  plan  by  providing  opportunities  for  training  and  overseas \nstudy programs. \n \n26. \nUpgrading  of  Research  and  Laboratory  Equipment.  The  Project  will  provide  and \nupgrade  essential  research  and  laboratory  equipment  of  selected  MARD  agricultural  research \ninstitutes  to  fill  critical  gaps  in  research  due  to  outdated  equipment.  Institutes  to  be  covered \nunder the Project are indicated in Appendix 4. At the initial stage of project formulation, a total of \n46 organizations involved in the national AST system, including research institutes, universities, \nand  colleges,  were  surveyed  and  37  organizations  responded  with  a  list  of  priority  equipment \nand facilities. The Government\u2019s plan to finance new equipment and facilities, and ongoing and \nplanned external assistance to these organizations were examined in collaboration with MARD \nfor  the  screening  of  organizations  to  be  funded  under  the  Project  and  to  avoid  any  overlap. \nDuring  this  process,  MARD  identified  10  high  priority  institutes,  whose  core  functions  and \nmandates  comply  with  national  sector  goals  and  that  are  not  covered  under  the  ongoing  and \nplanned external assistance projects or the Government\u2019s investment plans. The equipment to \nbe  covered  under  the  Project  mainly  constitutes  basic  equipment  urgently  required  for  the \ninstitutes\u2019 research programs.12 This project component will not establish any new institutes or \nfacilities,  but  will  mainly  support  upgrading  of  existing  equipment  and  facilities  as prioritized  in \nconsultation with MARD and concerned institutes to minimize necessary incremental costs and \nensure financial sustainability (para. 41). Small-scale civil works included under this component \nwill not require land acquisition or resettlement. Based on the list of equipment prepared during \nproject  formulation,  MARD  (the  central  project  management  unit  in  collaboration  with  the \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2005.

MARD  will  ensure \nthat  adequate  knowledge  and  skills  exist  at  the  institutes  for  utilization  of  the  procured \nequipment.13 \n \n\n2. \n\nGrassroots Agricultural Extension Improvement \n\n27. \nThe  Project  will  improve  farmers\u2019  access  to  participatory  and  pro-poor  extension \nservices, and strengthen linkages between agricultural research and extension services. Project \nactivities for agricultural extension will be implemented in five project provinces (para. 20) based \non  selection  criteria  that  include  (i)  a  focus  on  the  central  region,  where  incidence  of  rural \npoverty  is  high,  and  synergy  with  other  ADB-financed  projects;14  (ii)  existence  or  planned \nestablishment  of  a  provincial  advisory  council  for  agricultural  extension,  which  includes  as  its \nmembers  representatives  of  PAEC,  regional  research  institutes,  civil  society  organizations, \nfarmer groups, and mass organizations; (iii) possible operational linkages with regional research \ninstitutes;  (iv) high  poverty  incidence  in  the  upland  or  remote  districts  in  the  province;  and  (v) \nwillingness  to  participate  in  project  activities.  In  the  five  provinces,  the  Project  will  promote \ndecentralized  agricultural  extension  systems  based  on  a  stakeholder  participatory  process \nthrough provincial advisory councils. Based on the performance of the project activities during \nthe  first  2  years  of  implementation,  the  Government  and  ADB  may  consider  implementing \nextension activities under the Project in other provinces at the time of the midterm review. Under \nthis  component,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  strengthening  of  pro-poor  provincial  agricultural \nextension services, and (ii) promotion of contractual agricultural extension services. \n \nPro-Poor  Provincial  Agricultural  Extension  Services.  The  first  activity  to  be \n28. \nimplemented  under  this  subcomponent  will  be  the  development  of  provincial  plans  for \nagricultural  extension.  PAECs  will  select  priority  districts  in  upland  or  remote  areas,  conduct \nfarmers\u2019  needs  assessments,  and  identify  necessary  training  activities  and  potential  local \nservice  providers  through  workshops  and  consultation  meetings  with  national  and  local \nstakeholders. The individual provincial plan will be tailored to the situation and condition of each \nprovince, and provide a firm basis for the implementation of subsequent activities. The plan will \nhave special sections for women and ethnic minorities to ensure their active participation. \n \n29. \nBased  on  the  needs  assessments  and  the  outcome  of  stakeholder  consultations,  the \nPAECs will prepare appropriate training programs for provincial extension staff and grassroots \nextension  service  providers  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  implementation  consultants. \nPriority subjects of the training programs identified during project formulation include (i) skills for \nfarmers\u2019  business  development  and  financial  management;  (ii)  advanced  agricultural  science \nand  technology;  (iii)  participatory  and  farmer-centered  extension  methodology  and  community \norganization, including experiences and lessons learned under the farmer field school approach; \n(iv)  integrated  pest  management  and  other  environmental  concerns;  and  (v)  awareness  of \ngender mainstreaming and ethnic minority concerns. \n \n30. \nThe  training  programs  for  trainers  will  cover  a  total  of  40  extension  staff  from  the  five \nproject provinces. The number of staff from each province will be proportional to the size of the \nprovince.  Two  workshops  for  20  staff  each  will  be  organized  for  10  days,  and  promote  the \n                                                 \n13  The  proposed  implementation  arrangements  will  not  be  affected  by  Decree  No.115  issued  in  September  2005, \nwhich  requires  all  research  institutes  of  the  Government  to  become  financially  autonomous  by  the  end  of \nDecember  2009.  However,  if  different  implementation  arrangements  are  required  in  future,  the  Government  and \nADB will consider revising the proposed implementation arrangements, as required. \n\n14 Including the Rural Infrastructure Project in the Central Region proposed for an ADB loan in 2007. \n\n\f9 \n\nformation  of  20  two-person  teams  of  provincial  trainers  at  completion  of  the  workshops.  The \nteams  of  trainers  will  work  with  resource  persons  and  facilitate  the  training  programs  for \ngrassroots district and commune extension service providers. These programs will require about \n5 days and commence at the end of the first year of the Project. A total of about 270 programs \nwill  be  organized  during  the  project  period;  about  6,000  people  are  expected  to  participate  in \nthese  programs,  including  at  least  100  provincial  extension  staff,  400  district  staff,  and  5,500 \ncommune  service  providers.  The  lessons  learned  and  feedback  from  other  relevant  projects, \nincluding the ADB project financed under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction,15 will be fully \ntaken into consideration for planning and implementing this project component. \n \n31. \nIn addition, the Project will support ongoing technical training programs organized by the \nPAECs for local extension staff and farmer groups on other priority subjects identified during the \nformulation of provincial plans. Training for farmers in poverty-stricken upland and remote areas \nwill  include  an  emphasis  on  food  security  and  nutrition,  particularly  as  an  entry  point  for  poor \nfarmers to participate in the training programs. One overseas study tour for about 10 people to a \ncountry in Southeast Asia and a total of 34 in-country visits will be organized under the Project. \nThe  participants  will  be  selected  from  the  national,  provincial,  and  district  extension  staff; \nselection  will  reflect  the  need  for  increased  participation  of  women  and  ethnic  minority \npopulation in consultation with the National Agricultural Extension Center (NAEC) and PAECs. \nThe selection of participants in the overseas study tour is subject to ADB approval. \n \n32. \nTo  enhance  the  impact  of  extension  services,  the  information  and  communication \ncapacity  and  networks  of  NAEC,  PAECs,  and  district  stations  for  agricultural  extension  in  the \nproject  provinces  will  be  strengthened  under  the  Project  through  the  procurement  of  basic \nequipment and provision of support for incremental operating costs during the first 2 years. The \nProject  will  also  finance  national  mass  media  programs  on  subjects  related  to  AST;  this  is  an \nimportant part of the agricultural extension strategy to improve farmers\u2019 awareness, knowledge, \nand  information  on  production  and  marketing.  This  will  be  implemented  through  contractual \narrangements with radio and television stations with nationwide coverage. \n \n33. \nPromotion  of  Extension  Contracts.  The  Project  will  finance  on-farm  demonstration \ntrials  in  the  project  provinces  through  contractual  arrangements  with  regional  or  national \nresearch  institutes  to  strengthen  the  provincial  links  between  research  and  extension.  Past \nefforts  for  these  trials  in  each  province  should  be  fully  considered  to  avoid  overlapping  and \nduplicating  activities.  Each  contract  will  cover  the  fees  for  institutes,  extension  materials,  and \ntravel and accommodation costs. The Project will promote local contractual extension services \nto  mobilize  the  trained  grassroots  extension  service  providers  as  a  source  of  nongovernment \nextension services. These contracts will (i) cost up to the maximum of $10,000, (ii) need to be in \nline  with  the  provincial  plan  for  agricultural  extension  of  the  respective  project  province  (para. \n28),  and  (iii)  focus  on  the  priority  subjects  included  in  the  plan  for  improved  knowledge  and \ntechnology related to crop and livestock production and marketing. \n \n34. \nTo  ensure  pro-poor  and  gender-equal  service  delivery,  the  demonstration  trials  and \nextension services need to be implemented in the communes where at least 30% of households \nare classified as poor households in line with the national average for poverty incidence in rural \nareas and at least 40% of beneficiaries of these services are women. They will include efforts \nfor  community  organization.  The  contracts  to  be  awarded  in  the  final  year  of  project \nimplementation  need  to  ensure  that  at  least  50%  of  beneficiaries  are  women  farmers.  The \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB.  2005.

Manila (JFPR 9071\u2013VIE). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nawarded  contracts  also  need  to  specify  that  special  considerations  will  be  given  to  the \nparticipation and practices of ethnic minorities. A project-specific committee for the selection of \nextension proposals for funding will be established under the Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nRural-Based Technical and Vocational Training \n\ntechnical  and  vocational \n\nThe  capacity  of  rural-based \n\n35. \ntraining  schools  will  be \nstrengthened  by  (i)  improving  technical  knowledge,  teaching  and  managerial  skills  of  teachers \nand  administrators  and,  curricula;  and  (ii)  upgrading  library  and  laboratory  equipment  and \nmaterials,  teaching  and  laboratory  facilities,  and  office  equipment  for  school  administration. \nRelated civil works will be done on the existing compounds and will not require land acquisition \nand resettlement. Ten technical and vocational schools of MARD specializing in food processing \ntechnology,  postharvest  operations,  and  irrigation  management  have  been  selected  based  on \nconsultations with MARD and criteria that include (i) activities focus on rural worker training in \nthe  agriculture  sector,  (ii)  no  substantial  investment  for  rehabilitation  in  the  past  or  high \nbudgetary allocations, and (iii) no overlaps with the Vocational and Technical Education Project \nfinanced  by  ADB.16  Appendix  5  summarizes  the  training  schools  selected  for  the  Project.  The \nselected  schools  have  significant  student  enrolments  in  agro-based  technical  training, \npostharvest,  food  processing,  and  mechanical  engineering  related  to  agriculture.  Schools  with \nstudent  enrolments  mainly  in  subjects  like  accounting  and  bookkeeping,  and  other  trades  that \nare not directly related to agro-based technical and vocational training, have not been selected \nfor the Project. \n \n36. \nTo  ensure  that  these  training  schools  are  geared  toward  national  sector  goals  and \npriorities,  necessary  training  programs  and  workshops  will  be  provided  for  the  teaching  and \nadministrative staff in close consultation with other relevant agencies, including the Ministry of \nLabor, Invalids, and Social Affairs; and Ministry of Education and Training. The subjects of these \nprograms  include  (i)  partnership  between  training  institutions  and  agro-based  industries; \n(ii) school  planning  and  management;  (iii)  curriculum  development  and  learner-centered \nteaching  methods;  (iv)  development  of  teaching  and  learning  resources,  including  biological \ndemonstration  models  and  audiovisual  materials;  and  (v)  mainstreaming  of  gender  and  ethnic \nminority issues. Under  this component, the Project aims to improve teachers\u2019 ability to shift to \nlearner-centered teaching methods and strengthen their technical competency and knowledge. \n \n37. \nIn  accordance  with  the new  curriculum  guides  developed  under  the  Project,  necessary \nequipment and materials as teaching resources and for library and laboratory purposes will be \nprovided to the selected MARD training schools. These include (i) textbooks and other teaching \nmaterials,  (ii)  audiovisual  equipment  and  materials,  (iii)  computer  hardware  and  software, \n(iv) laboratory  equipment  and  testing  materials,  and  (v)  food  processing  machines  and \nequipment.  Small-scale  civil  works  costing  less  than  $500,000  per  contract  for  renovation  of \nclassrooms,  libraries,  and  laboratories  will  be  carried  out.  These  will  not  include  buildings  for \nschool  administration,  student  accommodation,  and  other  facilities  not  directly  related  to \nteaching and learning purposes. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB.  1998.

Manila (Loan 1655\u2013VIE). This \nloan  provides  support  for  only  one  school  managed  by  MARD,  Bac  Giang  Agricultural  Secondary  Technical \nSchool. \n\n\f11 \n\n4. \n\nProject Management Support \n\n38. \nSupport for project management will be provided for the central project management unit \n(CPMU)  and  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  in  five  project  provinces,  and  to \nstrengthen coordination between the CPMU and PPMUs. The Project will finance (i) incremental \noperating  costs  for  the  project  staff,  office  utilities  and  supplies,  vehicle  operating  costs,  and \ntravel  expenses;  (ii)  project  implementation  consulting  services;  (iii)  equipment  for  office \ncomputers,  photocopiers,  and  communications;  and  (iv)  one  service  vehicle  for  the  CPMU. \nMARD  will  allocate  its  two  existing  vehicles  to  the  Project,  and  provincial  administrations  will \nassign  their  existing  vehicles  to  the  project  activities.  No  civil  works  will  be  undertaken  for \nproject management purposes. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n39. \nLinkage  with  Policy  and  Institutional  Reforms  under  the  ASDP.  The  Project  was \nformulated in line with the national development priorities in the agriculture sector to strengthen \ncapacity  of  the  national  AST  system.  It  will  build  on  the  Government\u2019s  past  and  ongoing \nachievements  in  its  policy  and  institutional  reform  measures  implemented  under  the  ASDP \n(para.  12).  The  Project  will  fully  consider  appropriate  feedback  from  the  outcome  of  these \nongoing reforms under the ASDP during the project period. \n \n40. \nProvision  of  Research  and  Extension  Funds  on  a  Competitive  Basis.  The  Project \nwill support agricultural research and extension activities based on the selection of competitive \nproposals to ensure the implementation of client-oriented activities based on improved linkages \nbetween  research  and  extension.  This  funding  mechanism  is  relatively  new  for  regional \nresearch  activities  and  extension,  although  MARD  does  provide  competitive  grant  funds  for \nagricultural  research  programs.  To  minimize  the  implementation  risk,  ADB  has  provided \nadvisory  TA  (footnote  5)  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  AST  management  for  improving  project \nreadiness  in  the  national  AST  system.  During  project  formulation,  a  series  of  consultation \nmeetings were carried out with key stakeholders in the national AST system to solicit views and \nsuggestions on the proposed competitive funding system, and to disseminate the project scope \nand design. Provision of contractual grassroots extension services aims to promote participatory \nand  farmer-centered  services  based  on  Decree  No.  56  introduced  under  the  ASDP.  The  field \nsurvey  conducted  during  project  formulation  identified  strong  demand  for  access  to  improved \nknowledge and technology among farmers, and their willingness to pay.17 \n \n41.  Measures  to  Ensure  Sustainability  of  Project  Impact.  The  Project  will  not  establish \nany  new  public  institutions,  and  staff  numbers  and  other  incremental  costs  will  not  increase \nsignificantly.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  adequate  counterpart  funds  will  be \nprovided after project completion for operation and maintenance of the equipment and facilities \nof  research  institutes,  and  technical  and  vocational  schools  to  be  upgraded  under  the  Project \n(para. 70 [i]). New equipment will require consumable materials for which the Project includes \nprovisions for initial stocks of supplies equivalent to 10% of the value of the equipment. These \nstocks are expected to sustain operations during the project period, and allow demonstration of \neffective  utility  of  the  upgraded  equipment  and  facilities  to  support  increased  budget  provision \nand  funding  through  cost-recovery  research  contracts.  The  ongoing  TA  (footnote  5)  aims  to \nstrengthen  managerial  capacity,  and  strategy  and  business  plan  development  of  the  research \ninstitutes, thereby enhancing project sustainability. \n\n                                                 \n17 In selected provinces, community veterinary workers currently provide fee-based extension services for small-scale \n\nlivestock production. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n42. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  upgrading  of  facilities  to  be  financed  under \nthe  Project  will  be  carried  out  on  the  existing  compound  of  research  institutes  and  training \nschools.  Some  new  classrooms  and  laboratories  will  be  constructed  for  the  training  schools. \nSuch  construction  will  have  a  maximum  of  about  1,200  square  meters  on  the  existing \ncompounds and will not require land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n43. \nSocial  Considerations.  The  component  for  grassroots  agricultural  extension  will  be \nimplemented in the five project provinces where the incidence of rural poverty is high and ethnic \nminority groups constitute a high proportion of population in upland or remote districts. Individual \nprovincial  agricultural  extension  plans  will  be  formulated  at  project  inception  through \nconsultations  with  a  wide  range  of  key  stakeholders  in  the  provinces.  Action  plans  have  been \nprepared  under  the  Project  for  gender  mainstreaming  and  indigenous  people\u2019s  development \nduring project formulation; their recommendations will be adopted in the project activities. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $40.0 million equivalent, including taxes and \n\n44. \nduties of $2.62 million, and is summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nBase Costb \n1.

MARD,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation,  and  establish  a  CPMU  in  its  Agricultural  Projects  Management  Board.  The \nCPMU will be headed by a project director appointed by MARD, and include at least a deputy \nhead,  planning  officer,  finance  and  accounting  officer,  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer, \nprocurement  officer,  and  other  necessary  support  staff  on  a  full-time  basis.  The  CPMU  will \noversee  day-to-day  project  implementation,  and  ensure  interdepartmental  coordination  within \nMARD at the central level under appropriate technical guidance of (i) the Department of Science \nand  Technology  for  the  client-oriented  agricultural  research  and  capacity  strengthening \ncomponent,  (ii)  NAEC  for  the  grassroots  agricultural  extension  improvement  component,  and \n(iii) the Department of Organization and Personnel for the rural-based technical and vocational \ntraining component. The CPMU will also be primarily responsible for central-level procurement, \nconsultant recruitment, fund disbursements, and provision of support for the PPMUs. \n \n47. \nA  PPMU  will  be  established  under  the  provincial  department  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment in each of the five project provinces before loan effectiveness. Each PPMU will be \nheaded  by  a  PPMU  manager,  and  have  a  planning  officer,  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer, \naccountant,  and  other  necessary  supporting  staff.  The  PPMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nmanagement  and  supervision  of  the  project  activities  related  to  agricultural  extension  in  the \nprovince, \nfinance  and  project \naccounting, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting. The PPMU will (i) maintain \neffective  provincial  coordination  among  the  relevant  provincial  departments,  PAEC,  regional \nresearch institutes, and other key stakeholders; and (ii) ensure proper management of provincial \nactivities according to the agreed implementation schedule. Project management units may be \nestablished at participating research institutes, and technical and vocational training schools, if \nrequired  and  deemed  appropriate,  to  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  policy  for \nproject implementation and management. \n \nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee \n48. \n(PSC) to facilitate interministerial coordination and provide overall policy guidance. The PSC will \nbe  headed  by  the  vice  minister  of  MARD  in  charge  of  science  and  technology  matters,  and \ninclude  representatives  of  concerned  MARD  departments,  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training, \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Science and Technology, \nState Bank of Viet Nam, and the project provinces. The representatives of farmers\u2019 associations \nand other stakeholders will participate in the PSC meetings as required.  \n\nincluding  contractual  arrangements \n\nfor  service  delivery, \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n49. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  January  2007  to  December  2011. \nPlanning  for  the  training  programs  for  agricultural  research  and  extension  staff,  formulation  of \nprovincial plans for pro-poor extension services, and preparation of documents for procurement \nand staff recruitment will be initiated immediately after loan effectiveness. Appendix 7 provides \nthe implementation schedule. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n50. \nProcurement  of  civil  works,  equipment,  and  materials  will  be  mainly  carried  out  by  the \nCPMU in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines and the procurement plan as agreed \nand amended from time to time, and will follow the relevant procedures and regulations of the \nGovernment.  The  CPMU  will  be  responsible  for  formulating  contract  packages,  preparing  bid \ndocuments, evaluating bids, and awarding contracts satisfactory to the Government and ADB. \nCivil works for the Project are expected to be in small packages costing less than $500,000, and \nprocured  under  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Selection  and \nengagement  of  contractors  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval.  These  civil  works  will  not \nrequire  resettlement  or  land  acquisition.  Contract  packages  for  equipment  and  materials  are \nlikely  to  be  less  than  $500,000.  Supply  contracts  that  are  likely  to  exceed  $100,000  but  less \nthan  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding.  Universities  and  other \nspecialized institutions will be directly contracted for the overseas study programs as there will \nbe a limited number of institutions to provide post-graduate courses on the relevant specialized \nsubjects. \n \n51. \nSelection  of  research  and  extension  contracts  will  be  done  by  the  respective  selection \ncommittees to be established under the Project and assisted by the CPMU for regional research \ncontracts, and by the PPMUs for provincial research and extension contracts. MARD will submit \nthe evaluation reports on the selection of research contracts costing more than $50,000 to ADB \nfor approval. The procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n52. \nThe  Project  will  require  a  team  of  consultants,  including  29  person-months  of \ninternational  and  96  person-months  of  national  consultants  in  the  fields  of  (i)  agricultural \nresearch  management,  (ii)  agricultural  extension  management,  (iii)  agricultural  vocational \ntraining, (iv) social development, (v) environmental assessment, (vi) financial management, and \n(vii) monitoring and evaluation. An international consulting firm will be engaged to provide these \nservices.  The  international  agricultural  research  management  specialist  will  act  as  the  team \nleader.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and the procurement plan as agreed and amended from \ntime to time. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used, and simplified technical \nproposals invited from the short-listed organizations. The outline terms of reference and person-\nmonths  of  these  consulting  services  are  in  Appendix  9.  To  enhance  project  readiness,  an \nadvance action on consultant recruitment is being carried out to avoid initial delays in the start-\nup of project activities in the field. \n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy18  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \n53. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  Loan  Agreement  and  will  be \nincorporated in the bidding documents. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  MARD  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  Loan  processing  missions  of  ADB  emphasized  the \nsection  on  fraud  and  corruption  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines,  and  the  need  for \nstrengthening  financial  control  and  management  particularly  for  provinces  and  districts.  ADB \nloan review missions will conduct regular verification of the project statements of expenditures. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n54. \nThe Government will open a project imprest account at a commercial bank satisfactory \nto ADB immediately after loan effectiveness; it will be managed by the CPMU. An initial amount \nwill be deposited into the account based on the projected expenditures for the next 6 months, \nbut  will  not  exceed  $1  million.  In  view  of  the  difficulties  encountered  in  provinces  in  past  ADB \nprojects,  a  second  generation  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  provincial  treasury  of \neach  project  province  to  ensure  proper  management  of  the  provincial  accounts  and  the \naccounts of the project management units of the participating research institutes, and technical \nand  vocational  training  schools,  which  may  be  established  if  required.  Loan  proceeds  will  be \nmade  available  from  the  central  project  account  to  the  provincial  project  accounts.  The  initial \namount  to  each  provincial  account  will  be  based  on  the  projected  expenditures  for  the  next  6 \nmonths,  but  will  not  exceed  $50,000.  The  provincial  imprest  accounts  are  required  for  locally \npurchased equipment and materials, contractual services, and small-scale training activities at \ngeographically  dispersed  locations  in  the  five  project  provinces,  and  will  be  managed  by  the \nPPMUs.  Each  PPMU\u2019s  expenditures  are  subject  to  endorsement  by  the  respective  provincial \ntreasury.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  the  financial  regulations  of  the \nGovernment. The accounts will be liquidated and replenished according to ADB's statement of \nexpenditures  procedures  for  payments  below  $50,000  based  on  withdrawal  applications \nsubmitted to ADB from time to time. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n55. \nThe  CPMU  and  PPMUs  will  separately  maintain  records  on  project  accounts  in  a \nmanner  that  allows  identification  of  expenditures  under  the  Project,  and  have  them  audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB and in accordance with sound auditing principles. The \nannual  audit  report  should  include  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  imprest  accounts  and  the \nstatement of expenditures operations of the CPMU and PPMUs. Certified copies of the audited \nreports will be submitted to ADB, in English, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \nThe  CPMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  on  overall  project  implementation,  services \nprovided,  implementation  issues,  and  recommended  measures  for  improvement;  and  submit \nthem to the PSC and ADB within 30 days after the end of each quarter. The format for progress \nreports will be agreed between the Government and ADB at project inception. The Government \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nwill also prepare and provide to ADB a midterm review report at the end of the second year of \nproject  implementation  and  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  project  completion. \nThese reports will be in a form and have details satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n56. \nThe  CPMU  will  be  responsible  for  setting  up  an  appropriate  system  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  project  performance  and  impact  as  part  of  MARD\u2019s  management  information  system \nwith  assistance  from  the  project  implementation  consultants.  Some  baseline  data  and \ninformation  on  environmental  and  social  aspects  of  the  five  project  provinces  have  been \ndeveloped through detailed field surveys during project formulation and will be used to develop \nthe monitoring system. The social impact indicators developed and used for the Japan Fund for \nPoverty  Reduction  project  (footnote  15)  will  be  fully  taken  into  account.  These  data  and \nindicators will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity as required.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n57. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  conduct  reviews  of  project  implementation, \ngenerally on a semiannual basis. The CPMU will organize PSC meetings in conjunction with the \nproject  review.  Based  on  the  field  review  and  consultations  with  the  relevant  agencies  of  the \nGovernment  and  key  stakeholders,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  identify  critical  issues  in \nproject  implementation  and  agree  on  necessary  measures  to  resolve  such  implementation \nissues.  In  addition  to  regular  project  review,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  on  project  performance  and  impact  during  the  third  year  of \nproject  implementation.  The  project  completion  review  will  be  carried  out  upon  project \ncompletion based on the terms of reference to be agreed between the Government and ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n58. \nIn addition to the strategic importance of AST for the sustainable and equitable growth of \nthe  agriculture  sector,  the  Project  is  expected  to  generate  two  distinct  streams  of  economic \nbenefits  to  the  sector  through  (i)  more  client-oriented  agricultural  research  and  extension \nservices,  and  (ii)  improved  capacity  of  rural-based  technical  and  vocational  training.  Direct \nbeneficiaries will be farmers and the selected institutions involved in the AST activities, including \nagricultural  research  institutes,  extension  centers,  and  rural-based  technical  and  vocational \ntraining schools. \n \n59. \nThe Project will provide incremental and replacement equipment and facilities that will be \nused  in  combination  by  researchers  and  other  users.  Since  the  Project  will  strengthen  the \noverall capacity of the research and extension services, and does not support specific research \nand  extension  programs,  attempts  to  disaggregate  the  benefit  and  cost  streams  to  individual \nfinancing sources would be arbitrary. The nature of AST activities and the required time lag for \nthe  generation  of  benefits  need  to  be  taken  into  account  in  estimating  the  overall  economic \nimpact  of  investment  for  improved  AST  activities.  Past  studies  indicate  high  returns  to  AST \ninvestment  with  a  median  value  of  37%.19  Other  studies  based  on  adaptive  research  and \nextension activities in Viet Nam and in other countries also indicate that average rates of return \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2000.  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  the  Policy  Implementation  and  Impact  of  Agriculture  and  Natural \n\nResources Research. Manila (SST: STU 2000-17). \n\n\f17 \n\nrange  from  30%  to  50%.  Although  the  quantitative  estimation  of  direct  economic  benefits  is \ndifficult, highly positive economic benefits are expected from improving the national AST system \nwith  its  potential  economic  rate  of  return  in  the  range  of  30\u201350%  estimated  based  on  a \ncomparative  and  empirically  grounded  approach.  At  present,  public  financing  is  critical  to \npromote more sustainable AST activities, such as fee-based research and extension services. \nLong-term sustainability of these services will depend on the demonstration and dissemination \nof benefits so that farmer groups, local governments, or others develop ways to fund them. \n \nUnder the component for rural-based technical and vocational training, the Project aims \n60. \nto  improve  the  quality  of  graduates  from  10  selected  rural-based  technical  and  vocational \nschools  of  MARD,  which  have  substantial  student  enrolments  in  courses  on  agro-based \ntechnical  training,  postharvest  operations,  and  agribusiness.  The  economic  benefits  of  this \ntraining to society as a whole can be approximated by the private income streams received by \ntrainees.  This  approach  to  economic  analysis  is  the  same  as  for  the  ongoing  Vocational  and \nTechnical Education Project of ADB (footnote 16) and for other education projects. On the basis \nof assumptions about the number of new and existing graduates from the 10 institutions, their \nemployment  rates,  and  levels  of  remuneration,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \ncomponent  is  estimated  at  31%  for  the  base  case  scenario.  Sensitivity  and  quantitative  risk-\nbased analyses confirm that these returns are robust under a range of adverse circumstances in \nwhich costs may increase or benefits decrease. \n \n61. \nThe distributional aspects of the Project also need to be considered qualitatively. During \nproject  formulation,  the  need  for  special  measures  to  incorporate  poverty  focus  and  pro-poor \nAST  mechanisms  into  the  project  design  was  fully  considered.  The  five  project  provinces \nselected  for  the  agricultural  extension  activities  have  a  high  incidence  of  poverty  and  high \nproportions of ethnic minority population in upland and remote districts. However, that poverty \nfocus  is  accomplished  by  more  than  simply  selecting  areas  with  a  high  incidence  of  poverty. \nBased on ADB\u2019s dialogue with key stakeholders during project formulation and in relation to the \nongoing  ASDP,  provision  of  pro-poor  mechanisms  through  the  use  of  participatory  planning \napproaches and strengthening of grassroots extension services has been incorporated so that \nthe national AST system will become more responsive to farmers\u2019 demands than a simple, top-\ndown  distribution  of  knowledge.  The  project  components  for  agricultural  research  and \ngrassroots  extension  improvement  incorporate  these  factors  into  the  design.  In  addition, \nprovision  of  a  new  framework  for  pro-poor  extension  services  under  the  ongoing  ASDP  is \nexpected  to  enhance  the  positive  project  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  A  more  detailed \ndescription of economic benefits and sustainability is in Appendix 10. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n62. \nA  social  assessment  was  conducted,  based  on  existing  study  reports  and  rapid  rural \nappraisals  undertaken  from  December  2004  to  February  2005  in  the  five  project  provinces,  to \nexamine the livelihood and farming conditions of rural households. During the rural appraisals, \nspecial attention was given to analyzing the situation of ethnic minorities and operations of local \nextension services. All the data and information were gathered through focus group discussions \nand interviews with key stakeholders in agricultural extension and village leaders. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n63. \nTraditional farming knowledge does not always allow people to move away from chronic \npoverty and vulnerability. The effective use of AST knowledge and skills can play a crucial role \nin  promoting  farming  practices  that  will  help  smallholder  farmers  ensure  food  security  and \nincrease  their  household  cash  income.  The  selection  criteria  for  the  research  and  extension \n\n \n\n\fproposals to be funded under the Project will ensure inclusive social development by selecting \nproposals that address the needs of the poor and disadvantaged groups of farmers in upland or \nremote  areas.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Decree  No.  56  issued  in  2005,  the  Project  will \npromote  the  concept  of  decentralized  extension  services  and  decision  making  for  effective \nservice delivery in upland and remote communities.  \n \n64.  While women constitute half of the total agricultural labor force, the situation of women in \nthe sector is often characterized by imbalances in the regulation of civil transactions, provision \nof  credit,  and  delivery  of  agricultural  support  services.  Despite  the  important  role  that  women \nplay  in  the  agriculture  sector,  various  disparities  exist  in  women\u2019s  access  to  services  and \nproductive  resources.  While  women  work  in  most  agricultural  activities,  they  represent  about \n25%  of  the  participants  in  training  programs  for  animal  husbandry  and  10%  of  those  for \ncultivation. Women extension workers constitute about 30% of all workers. The project impact \non women is expected to be positive with a gender action plan to increase awareness of gender \nissues and to promote women\u2019s AST knowledge and skills. The project performance and social \nimpact will be monitored through the monitoring and evaluation system based on gender- and \nethnicity-disaggregated data and information, and regularly assessed every year. \n \n65. \nIn Viet Nam, more than 50 ethnic minority groups can be identified, and they have a high \ndegree of diversity in terms of language, lifestyle, kinship, belief, and farming practices. The five \nproject provinces covered under the grassroots agricultural extension improvement component \nhave about 15 ethnic minority groups, including Thai, Tho, H\u2019mong, and Cham. They constitute \n7\u201320% of the total provincial population, but make up a higher proportion in upland and remote \ndistricts.  Specific  measures  have  been  identified  and  will  be  fully  taken  into  account  in  each \nproject component to ensure that the needs and practices of the ethnic minority population will \nbe fully considered under project activities. \n \n66. \nAn initial environmental examination was carried out for the Project in accordance with \nthe guidelines of the Government and ADB for environmental assessments. The environmental \nscreening  revealed  that  the  environmental  impact  of  any  single  activity  is  generally  minor.  To \naddress any possible adverse environmental impact, the Project will ensure that environmental \nassessments will be carried out in line with Government regulations for the relevant categories \nof  civil  works  during  the  design  phase,  and  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  will  be \nimplemented.  A  summary  environmental  analysis  is  in  Appendix  12,  and  a  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n67. \nADB's  study  (footnote  19)  notes  legitimate  concerns  that  research-led  technological \nadvances in agriculture may benefit wealthy farmers at the expense of poor farmers. Wealthier \nfarmers  may  in  fact  have  more  resources  to  apply  new  technologies.  In  this  context,  special \nmeasures must be included to identify farmers\u2019 needs in poor communities. Under the Project, \nthe selection criteria for research and extension contracts and demonstration trials will have pro-\npoor elements to reflect local farmers\u2019 needs, and give priority to socially sensitive activities in \nthe  provincial  agricultural  extension  plans  with  regard  to  participation  of  women  and  ethnic \nminority groups. \n \n68. \nOther project risks include (i) inadequate provision of counterpart resources for operation \nand  maintenance  of  equipment  and  facilities  upgraded  under  the  Project,  (ii)  weak  linkages \nbetween  agricultural  research  and  extension,  and  (iii)  inadequate  stakeholder  participation  in \nplanning and implementing AST activities under the Project. The Government has assured ADB \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nthat it will provide adequate incremental budget to maintain sustainability of project impact. ADB \nwill  continue  its  dialogue  with  the  Government  to  ensure  adequate  financial  resources  for  the \nupgraded equipment and facilities. \n \nTo  strengthen  the  linkage  between  research  and  extension,  the  selection  criteria  for \n69. \nagricultural  research  proposals  will  require  the  inclusion  of  either  the  PAEC  or  provincial \nadvisory council for agricultural extension so that relevant local stakeholders are involved in the \nplanning  and  implementation  of  the  research  activities.  This  will  ensure  that  local  demand  is \nreflected  in  the  proposed  research  and  extension  contracts.  Similarly,  inclusion  of  provincial \nadvisory  councils  in  the  formulation  of  provincial  agricultural  extension  plans  will  facilitate  the \nprocess of stakeholder consultations in the project activities. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n70. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ntheir \n\ntransformation \n\ninto  self-financed  organizations \n\nTo maintain sustainability of project impact after completion, the Government will \nensure that it will provide adequate counterpart staff and funds for operation and \nmaintenance of the equipment and facilities upgraded in the selected agriculture \nresearch  institutes  under  the  Project.  The  Government  will  further  ensure  that \nsuch  institutes  will  provide  adequate  staff  and  funds  for  operation  and \nin \nmaintenance  after \naccordance with Decree No. 115, issued in 2005. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  criteria  to  be  applied  for  the  selection  of \nresearch proposals to be financed under the Project include (a) appropriateness \nto the local client needs based on the results of participatory rural assessments; \n(b) relevance to the national sector goals, strategies, and priorities; (c) technical \nand  financial  viability  and  sustainability;  (d)  linkage  with  agricultural  extension \nand  effective  mechanisms \ntechnology  development  and \nfor  participatory \ndissemination; and (e) compliance with social and environmental requirements. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  overseas  study  programs  to  be  funded  under \nthe Project will be carried out in a manner acceptable to ADB. In particular, the \nGovernment will ensure that appropriate arrangements are developed so that the \ntrainees  participating  in  the  overseas  study  programs  will  provide  relevant \nservices after returning from the programs. Such arrangements will be developed \nin  consultation  with  ADB  prior  to  the  implementation  of  the  study  programs.  At \nleast 10% of the total number of trainees will be women. \nTo  ensure  pro-poor  service  delivery,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the \ndemonstration \nthe  Project  will  be \nimplemented in poor communes where at least 30% of households are classified \nas poor households. \nThe Government will ensure that the project activities will be implemented in line \nwith the proposed gender action plan. In particular, the proposed gender action \nplan  will  be  reflected  in  the  provincial  plans  for  agricultural  extension  to  be \ndeveloped in conjunction with the Project. The extension contracts to be funded \nunder the Project will have provisions that at least 40% of beneficiaries of these \nservices  are  women.  The  contracts  to  be  awarded  in  the  final  year  of  project \nimplementation will have provisions that at least 50% of beneficiaries are women. \n\ntrials  and  extension  services  under \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the project activities will be implemented in line \nwith  the  proposed  indigenous  peoples  action  plan,  and  that  the  proposed \nindigenous  peoples  action  plan  will  be  reflected  in  the  provincial  plans  for \nagricultural  extension  to  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  Project.  All \nextension contracts to be funded under the Project will give special consideration \nto the participation and practices of ethnic minority population. \nThe Government will ensure that civil works to be financed under the Project will \nnot require resettlement or land acquisition. If resettlement or land acquisition is \nunavoidable, the Government will prepare a resettlement plan in accordance with \nADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement20 and submit it to ADB for approval prior \nto awarding the concerned civil works contract. \n\n(viii)  To  address  any  possible  adverse  environmental  impact,  the  Government  will \nensure that (a) environmental impact assessments will be carried out in line with \nGovernment  regulations  for  the  relevant  categories  of  civil  works  during  the \ndesign phase, and (b) recommendations of the initial environmental examination \nand  the  environmental  monitoring  plan  for  the  Project  will  be  effectively \nimplemented. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nA provincial project management unit (para. 47) will be established under the provincial \n71. \ndepartment  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  in  each  of  the  five  project  provinces  before \nloan effectiveness. \n \nAn  interministerial  project  steering  committee  (para.  48)  will  be  established  with \n72. \nrepresentatives  of  the  relevant  ministries  and  agencies  as  its  members  before  loan \neffectiveness. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n73. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  20,198,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Agriculture \nScience and Technology Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n17 November 2006 \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1995.

Although more than half \nof  the  total  cropped  area  is  dominated  by  rice  cultivation,  production  of  agricultural  crops  is \nbeing rapidly diversified with increased production and export of commercial crops. The trend to \ndiversify  from  food  crop  monoculture  is  expected  to  continue  as  the  country\u2019s  economy \nincreasingly  integrates  with  the  world  market  through  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization and regional free trade agreements among the countries in Southeast Asia. \n \nThe growth of the agriculture sector over the past decade is the result of a combination \n2. \nof  (i)  market-oriented  economic  policy  launched  in  1986,  (ii)  public  investment  in  irrigation \nsystems,  and  (iii)  increased  land  and  labor  inputs.  The  market-oriented  reforms  led  to  the \nprogressive decontrol of prices and market functions, recognition of farm households as the key \nunit of production and marketing, and liberalized land-use rights. The recent sector growth was \nattained  by  the  country  essentially  catching  up  with  international  and  regional  standard \npractices. However, continued agricultural growth will increasingly require new farming systems \nand  more  locally  driven,  productivity-based  improvements  for  increased  value  of  agricultural \nproduction. \n \n3. \nTo  address  this  sector  issue,  the  Government  recognizes  an  urgent  need  for  the \neffective  use  and  application  of  advanced  agriculture  science  and  technology  (AST)  in \nagricultural production and marketing. Strengthening of the national AST system is required now \nfor technological advancement to ensure food security, promote agricultural diversification; and \nimprove the quality of high-value crop, livestock, and fishery products that are comparable with \nneighboring  countries  and  trade  competitors.  This  will  address  the  needs  of  farmers  and \nindustries  for  better  quality  standards  and  delivery  of  agricultural  and  agro-based  products,1 \nthereby contributing to higher value-added in the agriculture sector and improved rural income. \n \n4. \nSeveral  policy  constraints  still  limit  the  emergence  of  an  open  land  market.  Limitations \non  land  transfers  and  land  size  constrain  the  availability  and  flexible  use  of  agricultural  land. \nDespite  active  lending  by  state-owned  commercial  banks,  access  to  formal  credit  is  limited  in \nrural  areas.  A  large  proportion  of  farmers  and  small-scale  enterprises  still  depend  on  informal \nfinancial  sources  for  their  funds.  Improved  rural  access  to  reliable  and  effective  financial \nservices  is  urgently  required.  Capital  investment  in  irrigation  development  absorbs  more  than \nhalf  of  the  national  budget  for  the  agriculture  sector.  Huge  losses  of  irrigation  management \ncompanies,  which  thus  underfund  operation  and  maintenance  activities,  result  in  the \ndeterioration of the existing irrigation systems and further losses in the state budget. Continued \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms  are  required  to  improve  access  to  these  critical  resources  for \nagricultural production. \n \n5. \nAs Viet Nam will be integrated into international markets, future growth of the agriculture \nsector will increasingly depend on postproduction activities (storing, processing, and marketing) \nand measures to fulfill more stringent market requirements. Agro-industries will play a vital role \n                                                 \n1  In Viet Nam, improved capacity of the national AST system would substantially improve product quality and safety, \nproduct  differentiation,  postharvest  operations,  and  marketing.  The  recent  growth  in  production  and  exports  of \nvarious  commercial  crops  (coffee,  rubber,  tea,  pepper,  groundnuts,  and  cashews)  needs  to  be  accompanied  by \nimproved research, extension, and training programs to strengthen the competitiveness of the country\u2019s agricultural \nand agro-based products in international markets. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nAST System and Funding \n\nin this aspect, and can lead to the development of export  markets, which will then lead to the \nprogressive  diversification  of  industries  and  expansion  of  other  sectors.  However,  trade, \nmarketing, and processing of agricultural products are still heavily affected by underperforming \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  The  Government  has  gradually  introduced  measures  to \nimprove  the  performance  of  SOEs  under  the  SOE  Law,  but  favorable  treatment  of  SOEs  in \nterms  of  access  to  finance  and  other  resources  constitutes  a  serious  obstacle  for  promoting \nviable  private  business  opportunities  in  the  country.  Implementation  of  continued  reforms  for \nSOEs  and  market  liberalization  are  required  to  strengthen  the  integration  of  improved \npostharvest systems in the agriculture sector. SOE issues will continue to be addressed through \nregular  policy  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nupdating  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program,  and  for  SOE  reforms  and  improved  corporate \ngovernance. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe AST system in Viet Nam has focused on high and sophisticated technology, often \nimported from outside and adapted in a way inappropriate to local practices and agroecological \nconditions. Even though this approach has generated increased production benefits, it has often \nbeen unable to adequately address the client needs of local farmers and traders, particularly in \nupland  and  remote  areas.  During  the  consultative  process  for  project  formulation,  the \nimportance  of  effective  management  and  coordination  of  the  national  AST  system  was \nemphasized  by  key  stakeholders  at  informant  interviews,  focus  group  meetings,  and \nparticipatory  workshops.  At  present,  the  Science  and  Technology  Council  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has general responsibility for overall management \nand coordination of the AST system. The council consists of more than 40 eminent researchers \nselected from major institutes and universities, and from different regions of the country.2 As an \nincreasing number of enterprises in agriculture and agro-based industries will constitute a major \nshare in the Vietnamese economy, agricultural research and extension will have to respond to \nthe  needs  of  not  only  farmers  but  also  of  these  agroenterprises.  Thus,  it  will  be  essential  to \nintegrate  research  and  extension  with  agro-based  industries;  the  corporate  sector  is  also \nexpected to contribute to financing a share of the research and extension budget. \n \nAgriculture constitutes about 6% of the total state budget. Beginning in the late 1990s, \n7. \nthe  Government  embarked  on  an  extensive  decentralization  program  in  public  expenditures \nbased  on  the  1996  State  Budget  Law.3  The  2002  State  Budget  Law  provides  provincial \ngovernments  with  considerable  discretion  in  fiscal  management.  The  share  of  provincial \ngovernments  in  total  public  expenditures  increased  from  26%  in  1992  to  48%  in  2002,  and \ndecentralization  continues.  Provincial  governments  appear  to  have  reasonable  capacity  for \nfiscal  management,  particularly  in  the  provinces  where  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  have \neffective  systems  for  monitoring  and  supervision.  In  line  with  this  overall  trend,  the  share  of \nagriculture sector expenditures for local implementation increased from 43% in 1997 to 79% in \n2002.  Most  of  the  agricultural  extension  services  are  being  implemented  and  delivered  by \nprovinces.  The  new  decree  for  agricultural  extension  (para.  18)  is  expected  to  increase \nprovincial  financial  flexibility  by  promoting  more  cost-effective  extension  services  and  possible \nuser fee contributions from local farmers. \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

Part  of  the  budget  is  also  provided  for  research  programs \nand institutes through competitive bidding systems, contributing to improved program budgeting \nin  agricultural  research  and  providing  opportunities  for  involving  nongovernment  research \ninstitutions in the national AST system. Underfunding of recurrent expenditures for staff salaries, \noperation,  and  maintenance  is  a  problem  for  all  AST  areas,  including  agricultural  research, \nextension,  and  training.  This  will  need  to  be  addressed  in  the  regular  dialogue  on \nimplementation  of  the  proposed  Project  and  on  ADB\u2019s  overall  sector  portfolio  management \nreview. \n \nC. \n \n\nOngoing Reforms in the National AST System \n\n1. \n\nAgricultural Research \n\n9. \nSince the late 1960s, the country\u2019s agricultural research system developed rapidly, and a \nrelatively complete set of institutes was created and endowed with a large pool of experienced \nresearchers,  educated  mainly  in  Eastern  Europe.  The  main  agenda  for  research  included \ncontributions  to  food  security,  production  of  diverse  commodities,  and  increased  exports. \nHowever, efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural research activities have been affected by a \nnumber of institutional and resource issues.  \n \n10. \nViet  Nam  has  a  complex  system  of  agricultural  research,  involving  six  ministries.  In \n2005,  MARD  alone  had  25  research  institutes  with  113  subinstitutes  and  centers,  and  6 \nuniversities. The annual budget for administration and regular operation of the MARD research \ninstitutes  amounted  to  about  D101.7  billion  ($6.3  million).  The  Government  attempted  to \nstreamline  the  system  in  1996  by  merging  several  institutes,  shifting  the  control  of  some \ninstitutes to SOEs, and converting other institutes to self-financing entities. However, this policy \nencountered  difficulties  as  some  research  institutes  and  SOEs  were  reluctant  to  accept  the \nproposed changes. \n \n11. \nThe Government fully recognizes the weaknesses of the existing system of agricultural \nresearch, which often results in a dispersal of scarce public resources, duplication of research \nefforts, weak capacity of research staff, and lack of feedback from producers and traders. The \nhigh concentration of the institutes in the two large delta regions (Red River and Mekong) has \nalso resulted in an uneven distribution of research institutes and their stations, and limited the \nrelevance of research results in other agroecological regions. A lower level of research activities \nhas been undertaken for upland farming systems, which constitute more than three quarters of \nthe  country\u2019s  land  area.  Furthermore,  uncertainty  surrounding  the  structure  of  the  national \nagricultural  research  system  has  long  made  it  difficult  for  research  institutes  to  formulate  their \nmedium- to long-term plans, and undertake effective investment. \n \n12.  Most  research  institutes,  established  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  have  not  received \nadequate support for upgrading of facilities and equipment. While the proportion of government \nbudget allocated to the national AST system has slightly increased in the last few years, many \nof  the  research  institutes  still  suffer  from  insufficient  state  budget  allocations.  Outputs  of \nresearch  programs  are  often  the  results  obtained  from  experiments  or  small-scale  pilot \nactivities. Extending them to large-scale production faces several difficulties due to the shortage \nof  human  and  financial  resources.  During  the  survey  carried  out  for  project  formulation,  many \nMARD  agricultural  research  institutes  and  laboratories  commented  that  they  urgently  required \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nresources  to  upgrade  facilities  and  replace  obsolete  equipment,  and  to  improve  institutional \ncapacity to conduct more effective research programs to meet client needs. \n \n13.  Within  the  next  10  years,  the  agricultural  research  system  is  expected  to  face  human \nresource constraints in terms of staff capacity. A large number of qualified senior scientists will \nleave the research system while the cadre of well-qualified scientists to take over their positions \nwill  be  relatively  small.  Under  the  ongoing  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP),4 \nMARD  formulated  a  detailed  plan  to  implement  the  reorganization  of  the  national  agricultural \nresearch system, which was approved by the Government in September 2005. The plan aims to \n(i) ensure focused research activities through effective coordination among research institutes; \n(ii)  carry  out  regionally  oriented  research  programs,  which  are  suitable  for  the  respective \nagroecological  regions;  and  (iii)  make  research  activities  more  responsive  to  national  sector \ngoals and demands of producers and traders.5 MARD also stated in its Science and Technology \nPlan  (2004)  that  its  priority  areas  for  research would  include  (i)  plant and  animal breeding,  (ii) \nproduct  preservation,  (iii)  agricultural  policy  and  marketing,  and  (iv)  natural  resources \nmanagement.  \n \n14. \nThe  Government\u2019s  approval  of  the  detailed  plan  was  a  significant  step  toward  further \nrationalization  of  the  agricultural  research  system  and  development  of  a  more  client-oriented \nsystem.  Several  institutes  involved  in  crop  research  and  genetic  engineering  were  officially \nmerged into the Viet Nam Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Under the ASDP, the Government \npromoted  a  competitive  grant  funding  mechanism  to  finance  agricultural  research  programs \nsuited  to  the  needs  of  different  agroecological  regions  and  client  needs.  Building  on  these \nreform efforts under the ASDP,6 the AST Project will provide financial support for the provision \nof competitive research grants and strengthening of institutional capacity and human resources \nfor improved agricultural research. \n \n\n2. \n\nAgricultural Extension \n\n15. \nDevelopment  of  agricultural  extension  services  in  Viet  Nam  is  relatively  new.  The \nGovernment  Decree  No.  13  on  the  establishment  of  provincial,  district,  commune,  and  village \npublic  sector  extension  services  was  issued  in  March  1993,  and  provided  implementation \nguidelines for the extension services in the field. In July 2003, the Government established the \nNational Agricultural Extension Center (NAEC) to create an agency solely responsible for public \nagricultural  extension  services  and  ensure  effective  service  delivery  and  coordination  by \nconcentrating scarce financial and human resources. At present, NAEC supervises about 3,200 \nspecialized  central,  provincial,  and  district  staff  members,  and  employs  part-time  contractual \nworkers,  including  about  7,500  commune  extension  workers  and  more  than  100,000  village \nassistants.  On  average,  there  is  one  specialized  extension  staff  member  for  every  3,650  farm \nhouseholds  in  the  country.  Public  mass  organizations  such  as  women\u2019s,  farmers\u2019  and  youth \nunions  contribute  to  the  provision  of  extension  support  for  local  communities  in  the  field.  In \naddition,  commodity-specific  producer  associations  for  coffee,  tea,  and  cotton  provide  training \non production technology and other services for farmers.  \n \nAccurately  assessing  the  contribution  of  agricultural  extension  to  farmers\u2019  adoption  of \n16. \nimproved agricultural knowledge and technology is difficult as the feedback from farmers during \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.

However,  access  to  advanced \nknowledge  and  technology  is  one  of  farmers'  critical  concerns.  Other  issues  related  to  public \nagricultural  extension  services  include  (i) inadequate  coverage  due  to  the  shortage  of  human \nand financial resources; (ii) dispersal of scarce financial resources due to continued use of high \ninput  subsidies;  (iii)  need  for  improved  understanding  about  farmers\u2019  concerns  related  to \nagricultural  knowledge  and  technology;  (iv)  weak  technical  capacity  of  grassroots  extension \nservice  providers;  and  (v)  need  for  appropriate  modality  and  services  suited  to  poor  farmers, \nparticularly in upland and remote areas. MARD recognizes that the past extension approaches \nwere  suited  to  the  needs  of  relatively  better-off  farmers,  who  were  able  to  afford  increased \nagricultural inputs. Provision and visibility of extension services in poor communities and upland \nand remote areas was low, and pro-poor extension delivery needs to be promoted through more \nparticipatory and farmer-centered approaches. Technical and managerial capacity of provincial \nagricultural extension services and grassroots extension agents must be strengthened. \n \n17. \nUnder  the  ASDP,  NAEC  of  MARD  formulated  and  issued  a  ministerial  circular  to  its \nprovincial departments to assist provinces in forming advisory councils to increase participation \nof local stakeholders in planning and implementing agricultural extension services. The purpose \nwas  to  promote  more  client-oriented  extension  services.  Advisory  councils  for  extension  were \nestablished in about 40 provinces by October 2006, involving key provincial stakeholders such \nas  representatives  of  farmers\u2019  associations  and  cooperatives,  women\u2019s  unions,  regional \nresearch  institutes,  provincial  agricultural  extension  centers,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), and private traders. \n \n18. \nNAEC  also  initiated  the  comprehensive  revision  of  the  Government  decree  on \nagricultural  extension  to  institutionalize  participatory  and  pro-poor  agricultural  extension \nservices.  Decree  No.  56  on  agricultural  and  fishery  extension,  approved  and  issued  by  the \nGovernment  in  April  2005,  (i)  emphasizes  the  need  for  client-oriented  services  with  an \nincreased  focus  on  economically  disadvantaged  areas,  (ii) recognizes  the  role  of  grassroots \nagricultural extension service providers in communes and villages, and (iii) includes a provision \nfor  contractual  arrangements \nfacilitate \ndecentralization  of  extension  service  delivery  and  increase  participation  of  farmers  and  other \nstakeholders,  including  mass  organizations  and  nongovernment  service  providers,  in  planning \nand  implementing  extension  activities.  Decree  No.  56  was  formulated  through  a  series  of \nconsultations  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  including  the  relevant  government  agencies \nand a group of NGOs involved in agricultural extension. The NGOs highly commended the open \nand  transparent  process  of  consultations  initiated  by  NAEC.  In  line  with  the  new  decree,  the \nProject  aims  to  promote  pro-poor  extension  services  and  strengthen  the  technical  capacity  of \ngrassroots extension service providers. \n \n\nfor  extension  services. \n\nis  also  expected \n\nto \n\nIt \n\n3. \n\nRural-Based Technical and Vocational Training \n\n19. \nThe  secondary  technical  and  vocational  schools  of  MARD  in  the  agriculture  sector \nprovide an important opportunity to  develop a competitive  work force for agriculture and agro-\nbased industries in Viet Nam. The agricultural training programs tend to be specified within the \nnational qualifications frameworks that are closely related to tasks and skills required in the work \nforce.  The  Education  Law  of  1998  provides  an  overall  framework  for  reforming  the  education \nsystem  in  the  country.  Particular  areas  of  focus  include  a  general  policy  for  decentralized \ndecision-making  related  to  the  planning  and  implementation  of  rural-based  training  programs, \nand  the  improvement  of  teaching  and  learning  quality.  Significant  renovation  of  curricula  has \noccurred at the primary level, and ongoing improvements are being carried out at the secondary \nand  higher  levels  with  ADB  assistance  under  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  loan  for  the  Vocational  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nTechnical  Education  Project.7  These  are  expected  to  impact  on  the  delivery  of  rural-based \ntraining through improved coordination within the national framework. \n \n20. \nViet  Nam  has  about  300  secondary  technical  schools,  of  which  one  third  is  under  the \ncontrol of the national Government, and the rest belong to provincial and city management. In \nthe agriculture sector, 31 of the 54 secondary technical schools are managed by MARD and the \nremaining  schools  belong  to  the  provinces.  In  addition  to  secondary  technical  schools,  the \ncountry  has  226  vocational  training  schools,  of  which  102  are  managed  by  the  national \nGovernment and the rest by provinces and cities. These schools provide technicians and skilled \nworkers with enrollments generally coming from lower secondary school graduates; the duration \nof  training  ranges  from  1  to  3  years.  In  agricultural  vocational  training,  MARD  manages  17 \nschools,  10  are  under  provincial  control.  According  to  the  assessment  during  project \npreparation,  the  quality  of  technical  and  vocational  training  schools  varies  in  the  agriculture \nsector. Some provincial institutions are funded and managed well with highly trained teachers, \nwhile others are poorly resourced and require substantial renovation. \n \nKey  issues  evident  among  technical  and  vocational  schools  in  the  agriculture  sector \n21. \ninclude  (i)  slow  improvements  in  curriculum  development  to  achieve  effective  competency-\nbased  training  methods;  (ii)  lack  of  systematic  flow  of  information  on  labor  market  demand  in \nagriculture  and  agro-based  industries,  and  weak  school\u2013industry  linkages;  (iii) inadequate \nteaching, learning, and library resources in AST; and (iv) lack of financial resources to maintain \nthe quality of training programs. As agricultural training institutions are under the jurisdiction of \nvarious  ministries,  they  lack  a  cohesive  management  structure  and  consistent  curriculum \ndevelopment. \n \n22. \nAt  present,  the  agricultural  technical  and  vocational  training  schools  do  not  have  any \nformalized mechanisms to determine labor market demand for various technical skills related to \nagriculture  and  agro-based  industries.  Systematic  labor  market  information  gathering,  being \ndeveloped under ADB\u2019s ongoing Vocational and Technical Education Project, has the potential \nto contribute to determining labor market demand in the agriculture sector or can be a model for \na similar system in the sector. The focus group meetings conducted during project formulation \nindicated increased efforts are required to strengthen school\u2013industry partnerships to meet the \ndemand from industries for school graduates.  \n \n23. \nInvestment  to  date  on  the  AST  areas  of  technical  and  vocational  agricultural  training, \nand, in particular, the areas of postharvest and food processing have been minimal. The Project \naims to contribute to filling gaps in these areas, and ensuring improved institutional capacity of \nthe  schools.  The  proposed  improvement  of  school  facilities  and  curricula  under  the  Project  is \nexpected  to  address  the  critical  needs  of  the  schools  to  respond  more  effectively  to  industry \ndemands.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  progress  toward  the  institutionalization  of  critical \nreforms that can be seen within the national technical and vocational education system. \n \n\n4. \n\nAgricultural Market Information Services \n\nThe  agricultural  market  information  system  (AMIS)  is  complex  and  heterogeneous. \n24. \nVarious public AMIS operations are ongoing and overlapping in area, scope, and responsibility. \nAt present, five AMIS activities are ongoing across 24 provinces. AMIS information usually flows \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  1998.

At the provincial level, the information is collated, and some rudimentary \nanalyses  conducted.  The  summarized  information  is  then  transmitted  by  fax,  telephone,  or \nInternet  to  provinces  and  MARD  for  dissemination  to  the  public  through  mass  media.  At  the \ncentral level, the Information Technology and Statistics Center of MARD is responsible for AMIS \nactivities and has six departments and units with 69 staff members. In addition, the Institute of \nPolicy  and  Strategy  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  of  MARD  handles  part  of  AMIS \ninformation  collection  and  analysis,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  market  projection  and  trade \nanalysis and promotion. \n \n25. \nThe  effectiveness  of  the  present  AMIS  operations  is  constrained  due  to  (i)  limited \nchannels  of  information  dissemination,  (ii)  inadequate  budgetary  allocations,  (iii)  poor  local \naccess to updated market information, (iv) shortage of trained personnel, and (v) weak linkages \nwith  extension  services.  To  address  these  issues,  the  Government  plans  to  strengthen  the \nAMIS activities of the Information Technology and Statistics Center with the use of part of the \ncounterpart  funds  generated  under  the  ASDP  program  loan  (about  $2.4  million),  through  the \nestablishment of AMIS in 20 selected provinces. Other external funding agencies, including the \nWorld Bank and the governments of Australia and Canada, plan to support the improvement of \nAMIS operations in the country through the development of market information services that are \nmore  responsive  to  the  needs  of  client  farmers  and  traders,  and  strengthening  of  analytical \ncapabilities  of  staff  involved  in  AMIS  activities.  ADB  considers  these  ongoing  and  proposed \nsupport activities to be adequate for addressing the existing needs of AMIS. \n \nD. \n \nAs  Viet  Nam\u2019s  agriculture  sector  is  increasingly  liberalized  in  line  with  the  country\u2019s \n26. \neconomic  policy  and \nfor \ndiversification into higher value agricultural and agro-based production is expected to continue \nin  the  next  decade.  The  policy  focus  needs  to  shift  from  increasing  production  volume  to \npromoting higher product value and income. In this context, rapid improvement of the national \nAST  system  is  required  to  address  the  needs  of  client  farmers  and  enterprises  for  benefiting \nfrom  (i)  improved  product  quality,  (ii)  better  skills  to  deal  with  complex  supply  chains  and \nsophisticated  markets,  (iii)  efficient  processing  and  postharvest  operations  and  innovative \nmarketing skills, and (iv) improved collaboration between private and public sectors. \n \n27. \nThe importance of strengthening the national AST system through continued policy and \ninstitutional  reforms  and  increased  investment  is  fully  recognized  by  the  Government  in  its \nnational  development  plans  and  strategy  for  the  agriculture  sector.  In  line  with  the  country \nstrategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam  and  in  close  coordination  with  other  external  funding \nagencies  involved  in  the  sector,  ADB  will  continue  to  provide  support  for  the  Government  to \nmaintain  its  sustainable  sector  growth  by  addressing  issues  related  to  productivity,  access  to \nresources, agro-industry development, and science and technology. \n \n\nNeed to Strengthen Agriculture Science and Technology \n\ninternational  markets, \n\ninto  competitive \n\nintegrated \n\ntrend \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nTitle \n\nDuration \n\nSource \n\nObjectives \n\nAgriculture Sector \nDevelopment \nProgram \n\nTea and Fruit \nDevelopment \nProject \n\nVocational and \nTechnical \nEducation Project \n\nAgriculture Sector \nProgramme \nSupport \n\nAgriculture \nDiversification \nProject \n\nNorthern Mountains \nPoverty Reduction \nProject \n\nCollaboration for \nAgriculture and \nRural Development \n\nStrengthening of \nthe National \nInstitute of \nVeterinary \nResearch \n\nSupport to Public \nAdministration \nReform Program \n\nRural Income \nDiversification \nProject in Tuyen \nQuang Province \n \n\n2002\u20132007  ADB \n\n2000\u20132006  ADB \n\nOngoing \nfrom 1998 \n\nADB \n\nOngoing \nfrom 2000 \n\nDanida \n\n \n\nOngoing \nfrom 2001 \n\nWorld Bank/ \nDFID \n\nSupport the Government's policy and institutional \nreforms to develop a favorable environment for \nmarket-based agricultural growth and agro-industry \ndevelopment. \n\nIncrease farm income and raise the value of \nagricultural production through tea and fruit \ndevelopment. \n\nHelp with the reform of vocational and technical \neducation system in line with the Government\u2019s \nmarket-oriented industrialization policy. \n\nProvide integrated assistance for agricultural and \nrural development through capacity-building activities \nat the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \nA second phase is being formulated. \n\nthereby increasing farm income and rural \nemployment through promotion of rubber \nsmallholders and improved livestock production. \n\nPromote community-based development activities \nthrough improvement of social and rural \ninfrastructure. \n\n1998\u20132005  World Bank  Help diversify and intensify agricultural production, \n\nOngoing \nfrom 2004 \n\nAusAID \n\nIncrease productivity and competitiveness of \nsmallholder agriculture and rural enterprises through \nsupport for agricultural research and development. \n\nOngoing \nfrom 1999 \n\nJICA \n\nSupport for the resolution of animal health issues and \ncontribute to improved veterinary research. \n\nOngoing \nfrom 2001 \n\nUNDP/ \nNetherlands \n\nOngoing \nfrom 2002 \n\nIFAD \n\nImprove public administration in the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development through capacity \nstrengthening in the use of information and \ncommunications technology. \n\nSupport villages with ethnic minority populations in \nupland areas to improve their access to rural \ninfrastructure, health services, and finance. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development;  Danida  =  Danish \nInternational Development Assistance; DFID = Department for International Development; IFAD = International Fund \nfor Agricultural Development; JICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency; UNDP = United Nations Development \nProgramme. \nSources: Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Government of Vietnam; and Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nAmount \n\n($million) \n90.0 \n(Loan) \n\n40.2 \n(Loan) \n\n54.0 \n(Loan) \n\n46.5 \n(Grant) \n\n66.9 \n(Loan) \n\n132.5 \n(Loan/ \nGrant) \n\n7.0 \n(Grant) \n\n1.9 \n(Grant) \n\n3.9 \n(Grant) \n\n20.9 \n(Loan) \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLIST OF SELECTED AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTES \n\nInstitutes \n\nRemarks \n\nA.

The  equipment  and  facilities  of  its  practice  food \nprocessing plants and library are obsolete, and need to be improved \nto meet the demand of local agro-based industries. \n \nThe  school,  located  in  Lam  Dong  Province  in  the  central  highlands \nregion,  has  about  34%  of  its  1,200  students  enrolled  in  the  subject \nareas of agricultural cultivation, animal husbandry, veterinary studies, \nand  land  management.  It  is  an  important  institution  for  rural-based \ntechnical  and  vocational  training  in  the  central  highlands,  where \npoverty  incidence  and  ethnic  minority  population  are  high.  As  the \nschool was established in the 1960s, most of the library, laboratory, \nand classroom facilities are run down and require upgrading. \n \nThis  school  is  located  in  Ha  Tay  Province  in  the  Red  River  Delta \nregion in the north of Viet Nam, and focuses on rural worker training \nland \nprograms \nmanagement. About 60% of the 1,500 students are enrolled in these \nprograms  with  the  majority  of  students  coming  from  the  upland  and \nremote  areas  with  a  high  proportion  of  students  from  ethnic \nminorities.  Seven  of  the  11  laboratories,  library  facilities,  and  about \nhalf of the 26 classrooms require renovation. \n \nThis rural-based training school has a high percentage of enrolments \n(about  70%)  in  agriculture,  animal  husbandry,  plant  protection,  and \nirrigation management. The school is located in Tien Giang Province \nin  the  Mekong  River  Delta  region,  where  only  4%  of  rural  workers \nhave  received  any  formal  training.  Local  demand  for  graduates  of \ntechnical and vocational training schools is increasing because of the \nincreasing  number  of  agro-based  and  food  processing  industries  in \nthe province (20 companies), and nearby provinces of Can Tho (100 \ncompanies),  Soc  Trang \n(60 \ncompanies).  These  companies  range  from  small-scale  to  large \nenterprises  employing  between  10  and  100  workers  in  each \nprocessing  plant.  The  school  plans  to  respond  more  to  this  local \nindustry  demand  for  training  in  agro-based  postharvest  processing. \nThe teaching staff is relatively young with about 40% under 35 years. \nThe school requires adequate laboratory equipment and facilities for \nthe delivery of postharvest training programs. \n \nLocated in Can Tho Province in the Mekong River Delta region, this \nvocational school has about 58% of students enrolled in agriculture, \ncovering  animal  husbandry  and  veterinary  studies,  crop  and  plant \nprotection, and sugarcane production and processing. The school is \nnear  an  export  processing  zone,  where  a  large  number  of  agro-\nbased  enterprises  are  engaged \nin  processing  pineapples, \naquaculture  products,  and  mushrooms.

MARD recognizes \nthe  need  to  increase  the  teaching  capacity  of  the  school  in  offering \npostharvest training through staff development and improvements in \nlibrary  and  laboratory  equipment  and  facilities.  Though  a  large \nproportion  of  managerial  staff  are  senior  staff,  the  teaching  staff  of \nthe school are relatively young with about 39% under 35 years. \n \nThis school is located in Ho Chi Minh City in the southeastern region \nof  Viet  Nam.  About  56%  of  the  students  are  enrolled  in  agro-based \npostharvest  processing,  significantly  contributing  to  technical  and \nvocational  training  in  the  subject.  Its  training  programs  include  food \ntechnology,  microbiology,  and  quality  control  of  food  products.  The \nschool  needs  to  upgrade  laboratory  and  library  equipment  and \nfacilities, and renovate some classrooms. \n \nThis secondary technical school has about 55% of students enrolled \nin postharvest processing, mostly at the upper secondary education \nlevel.  The  school  requires  upgrading  of  laboratory  equipment  and \nfacilities  for  practice  product  processing  activities,  as  the  quality  of \nteaching  programs  are  severely \nlimited  by  old  and  obsolete \nmachines  and  library  facilities.  The  school  also  indicated  its  strong \nneed for capacity strengthening of teaching and administrative staff. \n \nLocated  in  Ha  Nam  Province  in  the  Red  River  Delta  region,  this \nvocational school is mainly engaged in agricultural training, irrigation \nmanagement, and related mechanical works. About 90% of the total \nenrolments of 1,482 students are at the upper secondary level.

This  factor  accumulation  was \nlargely a result of state expenditures in agriculture inputs and infrastructure. However, the scope \nfor  continued  growth  based  on  such  investment  is  limited  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  The \nGovernment fully recognizes the need for a shift in the sector strategy to increased production \nvalue and diversification into higher-value products and innovative marketing. The Project aims \nto  support  this  new  sector  strategy  by  strengthening  the  national  agriculture  science  and \ntechnology (AST) system, and by supporting effective pro-poor delivery of improved AST. Other \nfactors that strengthen the case for the provision of AST by the public sector include (i) the role \nof the public sector to adapt research results to local needs, and extend research findings to a \nlarge number of smallholder and poor farmers through the nationwide public extension network; \n(ii)  poverty-reduction  dimensions  that  need  to  be  included  in  any  AST  efforts  in  Viet  Nam, \nparticularly in upland and remote areas; and (iii) strategic importance of AST for sustainable and \nequitable growth of the agriculture sector. \n \nAccurately  estimating  the  economic  impact  of  a  specific  investment  in  AST  activities  is \n2. \ndifficult  due  to  the  existence  of  various  external  benefits  and  costs,  spillover  effects,  and  long \ntime  lags.  However,  rigorous  efforts  have  been  undertaken  to  evaluate  overall  economic \nbenefits generated from investment in the AST activities. A special evaluation study conducted \nby  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  summarizes  past  studies  and  the  results  of  its \nassessment of case studies selected from the past ADB projects.1 This special study highlights \nhigh returns to investment in AST activities, including agricultural research and extension, with \ninternal rates of return ranging from 20\u201360% with a few exceeding 100%. The estimated median \nvalue was about 37%. The study indicates that the more disaggregated the analysis, the higher \nthe variation expected in the rates of return. Similar studies conducted by the International Food \nPolicy  Research  Institute  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  estimate  high \neconomic  benefits  from  investments  in  AST  activities  with  average  rates  of  return  of  30\u201350%. \nThe  economic  justification  for  the  Project  based  on  the  assessment  of  national  economic \nbenefits directly attributed to the project activities is difficult due to the nature of AST activities. \nHowever,  highly  positive  economic  benefits  are  expected  from  the  proposed  activities  to \nstrengthen the national AST system. \n \n3. \nIn view of the nature of benefits generated from AST activities, the distributional aspects \nof the Project also need to be considered qualitatively. The lack of access to improved AST is \nonly one aspect of multidimensional rural poverty. Access to improved technology alone cannot \novercome  poverty  as  the  role  of  technology  in  poverty  reduction  is  both  indirect  and  partial. \nLegitimate  concerns  focus  on  the  fact  that  rich  farmers  have  more  resources  to  apply  new \ntechnologies and that technology-led change in agriculture has favored better-off farmers in the \npast. Stakeholder consultations for project formulation identified the need for special measures \nand efforts to incorporate poverty focus and engineer pro-poor AST mechanisms into the project \ndesign.  The  five  project  provinces  selected  for  the  agricultural  extension  activities  have  high \nincidence  of  poverty  and  high  proportions  of  ethnic  minority  population  in  upland  and  remote \ndistricts (Appendix 11). However, the poverty focus is more than simply selecting areas with a \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  the  Policy  Implementation  and  Impact  of  Agriculture  and  Natural \n\nResources Research. Manila (SST: STU 2000-17). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nProject Alternatives \n\nhigh  incidence  of  poverty.  Simply  choosing  poor  provinces  and  districts  does  not  provide \neffective poverty focus as no area is wholly poor and the relatively better-off farmers will always \nbe better able to secure benefits often at the expense of poor farmers. \n \nADB\u2019s  dialogue  with  key  stakeholders  during  project  formulation  and  in  relation  to  the \n4. \nongoing  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP)2  indicate  that  pro-poor  agricultural \ngrowth  will  require  provision  of  mechanisms  for  the  AST  demand  of  poor  farmers  to  become \neffective  and  for  the  national  AST  system  to  be  restructured  to  be  responsive  to  farmers\u2019 \ndemands rather than a simple, top-down distribution of knowledge. The project components for \nclient-oriented agricultural research and for grassroots agricultural extension improvement have \nincorporated  these  factors  into  the  design  through  improved  linkages  between  research  and \nextension and through the process of stakeholder participation. These measures aim to ensure \nthat  the  local  needs  and  pro-poor  aspects  are  reflected  in  the  detailed  planning  and \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  In  addition,  provision  of  a  new  framework  for  pro-poor \nextension services under the ongoing ASDP and provision of technical and advisory support for \ncontinued  reforms  and  increased  project  readiness3  are  expected  to  enhance  the  positive \nimpact of the Project on poverty reduction. \n \nB. \n \nIn  line  with  the  AST  road  map4  prepared  in  conjunction  with  the  ongoing  ASDP,  the \n5. \nProject  stresses  the  importance  of  increased  investment  in  upgrading  physical  and  human \nresources to strengthen the country\u2019s AST system. The capacity and quality of the national AST \nsystem and institutions are expected to continue to deteriorate in the absence of the proposed \nProject.  ADB  has  emphasized  during  dialogue  with  the  Government  that  the  increased \ninvestment needs to be undertaken within the framework of the ongoing reform measures being \nimplemented  under  the  ASDP  and  build  on  the  ASDP\u2019s  major  achievements  in  policy  and \ninstitutional  strengths  related \ntraining,  and  market \ninformation systems. \n \n6. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Viet  Nam  (2002\u20132004)  and  its \nsubsequent  updates  highlighted  the  need  for  improved  AST  in  facilitating  the  country\u2019s \nsustainable  growth  and  geographically  focused  support  for  the  central  region.  Under  this \nframework, the Project\u2019s approach for capacity strengthening of existing institutions and human \nresources has been developed and is considered the most cost-effective option in comparison \nwith other alternatives. This approach is also in line with ADB\u2019s new CSP (2007-2010) approved \nin October 2006, which aims at pro-poor economic growth. \n \n7. \nUnder the proposed approach, selection of alternative methods has been made through \na  series  of  participatory  consultations,  where  stakeholders  (i)  determined  priorities  for \ninvestments  in  research  institutes  in  view  of  the  existing  stock  of  equipment  and  facilities, \ncapacity  of  research  staff,  and  proposed  investment  plans  with  the  Government\u2019s  own \nresources;  and  (ii)  included  the  technical  and  vocational  training  schools  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  with  substantial  student  enrolments  in  target \nsubject  areas  on  agro-based  technical  training  and  postharvest  operations.  This  process  was \nadopted  to  identify  the  specific  needs  to  help  the  country\u2019s  agriculture  sector  move  in  rapid \n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2002.

Direct beneficiaries will be \nfarmers  and  the  selected  institutions  involved  in  the  AST  activities,  including  agricultural \nresearch institutes, extension centers, and rural-based technical and vocational training schools. \n \n \n \n9. \nThe Project will not create any entirely new facilities from which clear streams of future \nbenefits  can  be  derived.  The  Project  will  provide incremental  and  replacement  equipment  that \nwill  complement  existing  equipment  and  facilities  previously  financed  by  the  Government  and \nexternal  funding  agencies.  This  equipment  and  facilities  will  be  used  in  combination  by \nresearchers  and  other  users.  Attempts  to  disaggregate  the  benefit  and  cost  streams  to \nindividual financing sources would be arbitrary. The use to which the resources will be put and \nthe benefits derived cannot be predicted due to the participatory, demand-driven nature of the \nresearch  and  extension  activities  proposed  under  the  Project.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  not \nsupport specific research and extension programs but aims to strengthen the overall capacity of \nresearch and extension services to meet the needs of farmers, traders, and enterprises. Thus, \ntaking  a  comparative,  empirically  grounded  approach  to  estimate  economic  benefits  of  the \ncomponents  for  client-oriented  agricultural  research  and  grassroots  extension  improvement  is \nreasonable. \n \nStudies on the investment in general improvement of the AST system estimate the rates \n10. \nof return in the range of 30\u201350% (para. 2). These figures can indicate some magnitude of the \nrates  of  return  expected  from  the  project  components  related  to  agricultural  research  and \nextension.  The  rates  of  return  claimed  for  sample  projects  cannot  be  an  accurate  guide  to \nestimate the returns expected from the broad-based AST support proposed under the Project. \nThese  rates  of  return  also  vary  widely.  However,  for  the  purpose  of  comparison,  the \npostevaluation  of  some  research  programs  actually  conducted  in  Viet  Nam  with  funds  from \nexternal funding agencies indicate a range of economic internal rates of return at 26\u201347%. More \ndetails of these comparative and empirical studies are included in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  graduates  from  10  selected  rural-based \n11. \ntechnical  and  vocational  schools  of  MARD,  which  have  substantial  student  enrolments  in  the \ncourses  on  agro-based  technical  training,  postharvest  operations,  and  agribusiness.  Project \nsupport will be provided to strengthen these subject areas of the 10 schools. \n \n12. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  linkages  among  the  technical  and  vocational  training \nschools,  colleges,  and  the  agricultural  and  agro-based  industries  in  the  respective  regions, \nparticularly  private  sector  employers.  In  partnership  with  industries,  15  new  curricula  will  be \ndeveloped  to  provide  modern  and  market-oriented  courses  and  enable  the  schools  to  provide \ncourses  for  an  increased  number  of  students.  To  ensure  that  the  new  curricula  can  be \neffectively taught, the Project will (i) provide necessary training for teachers and administrative \n\nImproved Capacity of Technical and Vocational Training Schools \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\nstaff;  (ii)  renovate  or  construct  their  classrooms,  libraries,  and  laboratories;  and  (iii)  provide \nequipment and materials. \n \n13. \nUpgrading 10 rural-based technical and vocational training schools, introducing new and \nrelevant  curricula,  and  improving  teaching  and  learning  resources  will  contribute  to  providing \nbetter  qualified  graduates,  who  will  be  readily  employable  in  the  agricultural  and  agribusiness \nenterprises. With the present enrolment of about 11,600 students in agricultural and postharvest \ndisciplines,  about  5,800  better  qualified  graduates  are  estimated  to  enter  into  the  skilled  job \nmarket each year. The increase in classroom capacity will allow student enrolments to increase \nby 10%, adding a further 580 graduates per year. \n \n14. \nFollowing  the  methodology  adopted  for  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Vocational  and  Technical \nEducation  Project,5  the  flows  of  incremental  incomes  of  the  existing  student  enrolment  level \n(5,800  graduates  per  year)  and  of  the  increased  enrolment  facilitated  by  the  Project  (580 \ngraduates  per  year)  may  be  quantified.  Accordingly,  the  flows  of  incremental  incomes  can  be \nassumed  to  reflect  the increased contribution  of  the  graduates,  and  thus  of  the  Project,  to  the \noverall  economy.  In  practice,  this  is  rather  arbitrary  and  conservative  as  the  graduates  will  be \nunable  to  secure  the  entire  productivity  increase  attributed  to  the  Project.  Based  on  the  past \ndata  and  information,  and  assumptions  of  (i)  working  life  of  graduates  of  20  years,  (ii)  course \nlength of 2 years, (iii) incremental annual earning of a graduate with improved capacity at $250 \nand that of an extra graduate at $500, (iv) a drop-out rate of 20% and employment rate of the \ngraduates at 90%, and (v) the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.11, the economic internal rate of return is estimated at about 31%. \n \n15.  Major  assumptions  of  the  base  case  scenario  have  been  subjected  to  the  sensitivity \nanalysis to identify the range and nature of critical risks. Based on the results of the sensitivity \nanalysis,  the  project  component  for  rural-based  technical  and  vocational  training  is  not \nconsidered  to  be  sensitive  to  adverse  changes  in  major  sources  of  benefits  or  costs,  and  the \ncomponent is highly viable. More details are included in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  will  not  establish  any  new  public  institutions,  and  staff  numbers  and  other \n16. \nincremental  operating  costs  will  not  increase  significantly. As  some  new  equipment  is  likely  to \nrequire additional consumable supplies, the Project includes a provision for initial stocks of such \nsupplies  equivalent  to  10%  of  the  equipment  value.  These  stocks  are  expected  to  sustain \noperations during the project period and initial post-project use. This will allow demonstration of \nthe  utility  of  the  new  facilities  to  support  increased  budget  provision  or  funding  through  cost \nrecovery research contracts. \n \nA  field  survey  was  conducted  during  project  formulation  to  examine  the  willingness  to \n17. \npay for improved scientific knowledge and technology among farmer beneficiaries. About 85% \nindicated  they  were  willing  to  pay  for  improved  AST.  This  indicates  potential  for  cost  recovery \nand  fee-based  nongovernment  services  with  acceptable  quality.  A  variety  of  sources  provide \nimproved  AST  and  related  services  on  a  commercial  or  voluntary  basis  as  well  as  by  public \nagencies. In future, training provided for extension service providers is likely to be sustainable at \ncharge rates that are affordable to farmers. \n\nFinancial and Institutional Sustainability \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  1998.

Manila (Loan 1655\u2013VIE). \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nThe  proposed  village,  commune,  and  district  extension  contracts  are  new  in  Viet Nam, \n18. \nand  mainly  practiced  now  by  a  few  international  nongovernment  organizations.  Under  the \nongoing ASDP, the Government issued the revised Decree No. 56 in April 2005 on agricultural \nextension,  which  provides  the  basis  for  promoting  various  forms  of  nongovernment  extension \nservices. At present, public financing is critical to promote these fee-based extension services, \nwhich,  as  its  benefits  are  demonstrated,  may  develop  into  a  sustainable  model  in  the  longer \nterm.  Sustainability  of  the  extension  contracts  then  depends  on  the  demonstration  and \ndissemination  of  benefits  so  that  individual  farmers,  farmer  groups,  local  government, \nenterprises, or others develop ways to fund them. \n \n19. \nUnder  the  component  of  rural-based  technical  and  vocational  training  schools,  the \nupgraded  staff  will  be  the  existing  teaching  and  administrative  staff  trained  under  the  Project \nrather  than  new  staff  recruited  to  increase  payrolls.  In  6  of  the  10  schools,  the  number  of \nclassrooms or students will not increase, so no subsequent increase in the number of teachers \nis  expected.  Under  the  Project,  the  total  number  of  classrooms,  concentrated  in  expansion  of \ntwo  schools,  will  be  increased  from  201  to  215  with  a  probable  need  for  a  comparable  7% \nincrease  in  teaching  staff.  The  new  curricula  and  supporting  equipment  and  facilities  may \nrequire  certain  increases  in  recurrent  costs  beyond  the  needs  of  the  old  curricula,  but  these \nrequirements can only be accurately estimated when the curriculum development processes are \ncompleted. \n \n20. \nThe Government has assured ADB that it will provide adequate counterpart budget for \nthe AST activities proposed under the Project. In 2005, the state budget (including both central \nand provincial budget allocations) for agricultural research was D262.7 billion ($16.4 million) and \nfor  agricultural  extension  D308.6  billion  ($19.2 million).  To ensure  longer  term  sustainability  of \nproject  impact  after  completion,  the  Government  has  also  assured  ADB  that  it  will  provide \nadequate funds for operation and maintenance of the equipment and facilities upgraded under \nthe  Project.  The  annual  incremental  cost  for  the  10  research  institutes  is  estimated  at  about \n$230,000, and the annual cost for the 10 technical and vocational schools at about $360,000. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n \n   No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement? \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe agriculture sector accounts for about 21% of the national gross domestic product (GDP), 60% of the total labor \nforce,  and  30%  of  the  country's  exports.  Because  many  of  the  poor  engage  in  agriculture  as  their  livelihood  and \nincome source, it is the key sector to reduce poverty in the country. \n \nWhile poverty incidence was halved during 1993\u20132002, the pace and rate of poverty reduction varies among regions. \nPoverty  incidence  remains  high  in  upland  and  remote  areas  and  in  pockets  of  densely  populated  deltas  and  river \nbasins. Among ethnic minorities in particular, who have benefited little from economic growth in the past decade, the \nincidence  of  poverty  is  almost  static.  Lessening  disparities  and  inequality  remains  an  emerging  challenge  in  poverty \nreduction in Viet Nam. \n \nThe  country\u2019s  5-year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  continues  to  underscore  investment  in  the \nagriculture sector as one of the means to make economic growth socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. \n \nStrengthening  agriculture  science  and  technology  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  sustainable  economic \ngrowth by reforming agricultural research and extension, and increased private investment in agricultural processing. \nMajor opportunities exist for increasing agricultural productivity and product improvement, and ensuring food security \nand  job  opportunities.  Specific  provisions  in  improving  the  access  and  usage  of  extension  services  by  the  poor, \nwomen, and ethnic minorities will address the need for improving their rural livelihood. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA comprehensive poverty analysis was conducted during project preparatory technical assistance, with the review of \nexisting documents complemented by rapid rural appraisals (RRAs) in the five project provinces (Dak Nong, Nghe An, \nNinh  Thuan,  Quang  Nam,  and  Thanh  Hoa)  to  investigate  the  farming  practices  and  livelihoods  of  remote  rural \nhouseholds.  Special  care  was  given  to  analyze  the  situation  of  ethnic  minorities  and  their  access  to  and  usage  of \nextension services. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  achievements  in  terms  of  social  development  and  poverty  reduction  have  been  remarkable.  Almost  one \nthird  of  the  total  population  was  lifted  out  of  poverty  in  less  then  10  years.  Economic  growth  underpinned  the  rapid \npoverty reduction. \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nOn the other hand, rural poverty is widespread, particularly in upland and remote areas. The country's overall poverty \nincidence  was  estimated  at  about  23%  in  2004;  more  than  80%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas. The  pace  of  poverty \nreduction in upland and remote areas is much slower than the national average. \n\nLow  agricultural  productivity,  monocropping,  and  weak  competitiveness  in  markets  are  major  explanatory  factors  for \nrural  poverty  in  Viet  Nam.  The  poor  in  rural  areas  have  limited  access  to  productive  resources  and  improved \nknowledge  and  technology,  and  are  more  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters  such  as  flood  and  drought.  The  most \ncommon cause of rural poverty is the lack  of productive resources, namely capital, knowledge, and land. A detailed \npoverty analysis identifies a number of issues that need attention: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\naccess to and control of land (including forest and forest products), capital, information, and knowledge are \nlimited; \nrural women have proportionally less access to productive resources than men; and \nethnic  minority  groups  are  proportionally  much  poorer  than  Vietnamese  (Kinh)  groups,  in  particular  those \nliving in the remote districts. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nOther important issues are \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\naccess to training, health, and sanitation facilities, \ncommunity participation in decision making, and \nrecognition of cultural and environmental diversity. \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n \nAgriculture  science  and  technology,  including  research,  extension,  and  training,  have  an  important  role  to  play  in \npoverty reduction. However, the current approach and lowland-biased views in agricultural production is not effective \nor  functional  to  meet  the  unmet  demand.  This  was  one  of  the  main  findings  of  the  RRAs  conducted  during  project \nformulation. One of the thrusts of the Project is to make agricultural research, extension, and training services more \nrelevant to poor farmers\u2019 existing needs and priorities, thereby improving their skills and knowledge and reducing rural \npoverty. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe  formulation  of  the  Agriculture  Science  and  Technology  Project  has  involved  comprehensive  consultations  and \ndiscussions with a wide range of stakeholders. Stakeholder opinions and inputs have been sought through a number \nof  modalities,  including  key  informant  interviews,  participatory  workshops,  focus  group  discussions,  surveys  and \nquestionnaires,  and  the  RRAs.  Stakeholders  have  been  consulted  at  all  levels,  including  ministries,  departments, \nresearch  institutes,  extension  centers,  universities,  provincial  people\u2019s  committees,  districts,  communes,  and  farmer \ngroups.  Consultations  have  also  included  representatives  of  international  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and \nexternal funding agencies operating in the agriculture sector in Viet Nam. \n \nRRA  surveys  were  conducted  in  the  five  project  provinces  to  identify  farmers\u2019  needs  and  priorities  in  information, \nknowledge, and extension advice and those of the poor, women, and ethnic minorities. This consisted of an extensive \nRRA in 17 districts. The RRA was complemented by informant interviews, which included the managers of factories, \nentrepreneurs, and NGO staff. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe Project  will adopt a participatory approach during the implementation phase. In particular, provincial agricultural \nextension  plans  will  be  formulated  through  an  extensive  consultative  process  with  the  provincial  extension  advisory \ncouncils,  which  include  a  wide  range  of  key  stakeholders  in  the  respective  project  provinces.  To  increase  the \nparticipation  of  the  poor  so  that  they  benefit  from  the  Project,  special  care  will  be  given  to  enhance  participation  of \npotential  women  and  ethnic  minority  group  beneficiaries  through  intense  dissemination  activities  and  focused \nawareness campaigns. For this purpose, the Project will develop the capacity of associations, farmer groups, and local \nNGOs.  NGOs  are  expected  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  fostering  social  mobilization  in  the  field  and  reach  the  most \nvulnerable and excluded groups such as ethnic minority communities and poor farmers in upland and remote areas. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender is fully integrated in the country\u2019s socioeconomic development plan, which supports actions to reduce gender \ndisparities  and  ensure  empowerment.  The  Government  is  committed  to  gender  equality  through  policies,  strategies, \nand  actions.  The  National  Strategy  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  in  Viet  Nam  by  2010  is  in  place  with  discrete \ntargets  for  2010,  which  relate  to  equal  rights  for  women  in  labor,  employment,  education,  and  health  care;  and  an \nincrease in the number of woman candidates for leadership positions at all levels and in all sectors. The Strategy calls \nfor  increased  participation  of  women  so  that  women  will  account  for  50%  of  all  participants  in  technical  training \nprograms and beneficiaries of public services. \n \nIn accordance with the Government strategies and commitments, the Project has mainstreamed gender in its scope. \nThe impact on women will be positive as the Project will incorporate specific means to increase awareness of gender \nissues and promote women's knowledge and participation in advanced agriculture science and technology.

The screening revealed that potential environmental impacts \nof project activities are generally minor, and that the project scope to support the strengthening \nof  the  national  agriculture  science  and  technology  (AST)  system  would  have  mainly  indirect \npositive impacts on agricultural production. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts Associated with Civil Works \n\n2. \nThe  research  and  training  components  will  involve  minor  upgrading  and  new \nconstruction  at  a  research  institute  (the  Viet  Nam  Academy  of  Agricultural  Science)  and  10 \nselected  technical  and  vocational  training  schools.  A  likely  scope  of  upgrading  and  new \nconstruction  work  covers  small-scale  civil  works  for  $20,000\u2013$30,000  per  contract  at  the \nresearch  institute  (a  greenhouse  and  a  pilot  tea  plantation);  and  $100,000\u2013$200,000  per \ncontract  for  each  school  for  libraries,  classrooms,  and  laboratories.  The  total  amount  of  civil \nworks for the whole Project is about $1.6 million excluding contingencies. Related civil work will \nbe done on the existing compounds and will not require land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n3. \nThe  small-scale  civil  work  may  cause  potential  negative  impacts  such  as  noise,  dust, \nand demolition waste. These negative impacts are likely to be minor and short term, and can be \nmitigated  with  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  including  restricted  hours  for  work  and \ntransportation  of  materials  and  appropriate  waste  disposal  and  management.  Old  insulation \nmaterials  and  pipes  may  contain  asbestos  and  lead,  and  an  on-site  environmental  monitoring \nplan  will  be  required  as  part  of  overall  project  management  to  ensure  appropriate  disposal  of \nhazardous  wastes.  Chemical  management  at  the  laboratories  of  the  selected  10  training \nschools will be strengthened through developing and implementing the laboratory management \nmanuals to improve laboratory operation. During the design phase, any environmental work will \nbe  done  prior  to  civil  works  in  order  to  obtain  certification  from  the  provincial  department  of \nnatural  resources  and  environment,  if  necessary,  and  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s \nregulations. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nAll  components  include  the  procurement  of  equipment  and  materials.  The  research \ncomponent  will  procure  essential  laboratory  equipment  for  the  selected  agricultural  research \ninstitutes  in  the  areas  of  crop  production,  livestock,  postharvest  technology,  natural  resources \nmanagement,  and  agricultural  policy  planning.  The  extension  component  will  procure  audio-\nvisual and office equipment for training activities. The rural-based training component will mainly \nprocure equipment and materials used for classrooms, libraries, and laboratories. The procured \nequipment  and  materials  are  unlikely  to  cause  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Environmental \ncriteria will be included as part of the procurement criteria to ensure that (i) procured goods are \nnot  listed  in  the  prohibited  items  in  the  national  laws  and  regulations,  and  do  not  include \nluxurious,  military,  or  extremely  hazardous  items  not  related  to  the  project  activities;  and \n(ii) energy conservation, and reuse and recycling considerations for new office equipment will be \ntaken into account as appropriate. \n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts Associated with Procurement \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\nEnvironmental Enhancement Measures \n\nD. \n \n5. \nThe  environmental  screening  did  not  find  any  significant  negative  impacts  generating \nfrom  the  proposed  project  activities.  The  Project  includes  numerous  opportunities  to  introduce \nenvironment  enhancement  measures.  Minor  or  significantly  positive  impacts  can  be  expected \nwhen  increased  attention  on  environmental  issues  is  made  during  project  implementation. \nUnder  the  research  component,  minor  positive  environmental  impacts  are  expected  with  the \ninclusion  of  environmental  criteria  in  funding  research  proposals  and  staff  training.  Under  the \nextension  component,  integrating  environmental  considerations  into  the  training  programs  for \nextension  staff,  farmers,  and  service  providers  can  contribute  to  improved  understanding  of \nsustainable agricultural practices. Increased attention to environmental issues in the curriculum \ndevelopment  for  training  schools  can  promote  improved  knowledge  on  the  close  relationship \nbetween agriculture and environment, and facilitate application of gained skills in the agriculture \nsector.  The  scope  of  environmental  enhancement  measures  will  be  determined  during  the \ndetailed design. \n \nE. \n \n6. \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency  for  the  Project  and  be  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  MARD  will \nestablish  a  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  in  its  Agricultural  Projects  Management \nBoard. The CPMU, headed by a project director, will ensure overall project implementation and \ncoordination  within  MARD  and  with  other  relevant  agencies  of  the  Government,  including  the \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment.  A  provincial  project  management  unit  will  be \nestablished under the provincial department of agriculture and rural development in each of the \nfive project provinces and be responsible for overall management and supervision of the project \nactivities related to agricultural extension in the province. In addition, project management units \nmay  be  established  at  participating  research  institutes,  and  technical  and  vocational  training \nschools.

The EMP will focus on (i) procurement of civil works, equipment, and materials; and \n(ii)  implementation  of  environmental  enhancement  measures.  International  (2  person-months) \nand national (11 person-months) environmental consultants will assist the CPMU and provincial \nproject management units to develop site-specific EMP and monitor EMP progress on a regular \nbasis. The total cost for implementing the EMP for the Project is tentatively estimated at about \n$140,000,  including  expenses  for  (i)  environmental  assessment  works  for  classrooms,  school \nlaboratories,  and  libraries  ($20,000);  (ii)  required  staff  and  consultants  ($110,000);  and  (iii) \nmiscellaneous costs for equipment and field trips ($10,000). The cost of implementing the EMP \nrepresents about 0.3% of the total project cost, and mainly consists of expenditures for human \nresources. \n \nF. \n \n8. \nExtensive  consultation  was  conducted  from  April  2004  through  February  2005.  During \nthe  first  phase,  the  consultant  team  carried  out  the  task  of  sector  review,  issue  identification, \nand draft component design based on a multistakeholder participatory approach. This involved \nan  extensive  series  of  consultative  activities  including  key  informant  interviews,  rapid  rural \nappraisals,  requests  for  comments,  workshops,  focus  group  meetings,  and  surveys  with  more \nthan 400 individuals, ranging from the ministries to grassroots stakeholders in farm households.  \n \n9. \nIn addition, a market information needs survey was carried out during project formulation \nin  eight  agroecological  zones  in  nine  provinces.  This  is  the  first  of  its  type  undertaken  in  Viet \nNam. The objective of the survey was to obtain information from farmers and traders on (i) the \ncurrent  sources  of  market  information,  (ii)  preferred  sources  of  information,  (iii)  importance  of \ndifferent  information  types,  (iv)  frequency  of  information  needs,  (v)  willingness  to  pay  for \ninformation, and (vi) content of user-pay information services. \n \nEnvironment  and  natural  resources  management  was  an  integral  part  of  the  project \n10. \nformulation  exercise.  During  project  implementation,  close  consultations  particularly  with \nfarmers will continue in relation to the introduction of improved AST information and knowledge, \nand  any  concerns  among  farmers  and  other  key  stakeholders  will  be  adequately  incorporated \ninto the project activities. \n \nG. \n \nThe Project will contribute to sustainable and equitable growth of the agriculture sector \n11. \nand  poverty  reduction  through  strengthening  of  the  national  AST  system.  It  will  facilitate \ntechnology  development  and  dissemination,  and  improve  the  quality  of  agriculture  and  agro-\nbased products for domestic and export markets. The Project will complement the ongoing and \nplanned  activities  of  external  funding  agencies  and  NGOs,  and  will  be  implemented  based  on \nthe  investment  needs  of  the  relevant  agricultural  research  institutes,  organizations  involved  in \nagricultural extension, and technical and vocational training schools. \n \nThe  environmental  screening  of  the  Project  yielded  (i)  no  significant  negative  impacts, \n12. \n(ii) some  minor  negative  impacts  that  can  be  mitigated,  (iii)  some  neutral  impacts,  (iv)  some \nminor  positive  impacts  that  can  be  enhanced,  and  (v)  some  potentially  significant  positive \nimpacts.  Specific  recommendations  are  included  in  the  EMP.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination concluded that no further preparatory environmental studies were required. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "ADB \nAMIS \nASDP \nAST \nCPMU \nCSP \nEMP \nGDP \nMARD \nMPI \nNAEC \nNGO \nPAEC \nPPMU \nPSC \nRRA \nSOE \nTA \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 5 October 2006) \n", "Currency Unit\nD1,000\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "dong (D) \n$0.0623 \nD16,050 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nagricultural market information system \nAgriculture Sector Development Program \nagriculture science and technology \ncentral project management unit \ncountry strategy and program \nenvironmental monitoring plan \ngross domestic product \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nMinistry of Planning and Investment \nNational Agricultural Extension Center \nnongovernment organization \nprovincial agricultural extension center \nprovincial project management unit \nproject steering committee \nrapid rural appraisal \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "C.
