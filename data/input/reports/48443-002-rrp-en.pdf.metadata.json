It will also complement \nthe  government\u2019s  efforts  to  align  MSW  services  with  sustainable  development.  It  will  support \noverall  strategies  to  reduce  the  discharge  of  long-term  pollutants  in  the  Xiangjiang  River \nwatershed and has significant potential for wide replication. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Xiangjiang River and its watershed are part of the larger Dongting Lake watershed. \nBoth watersheds are integral elements of the downstream Yangtze River watershed. The Yangtze \nRiver Economic Belt (YREB) covers nine provinces and two specially administered cities in the \nYangtze  River  Basin.  It  accounts  for  over  40%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  population  and  has  40%  of  the \nfreshwater  resources.  It  also  serves  as  the  drinking  water  resource  for  400  million  people, \nprovides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland area, and contributes \nabout  45% of  the  PRC\u2019s  economic output.  The PRC\u2019s  YREB  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132030,2 \nstipulates the prioritization of ecological protection and promotion of green development as the \nguiding principle for the YREB development. As upstream watersheds, the Xiangjiang River and \nDongting Lake play a pivotal role in the water quality of the Yangtze River watershed and in the \ngeneral maintenance of healthy rivers and waterways. Therefore, the Xiangjiang River watershed \nis a key water resource in the overall strategic planning for water security in the Yangtze River, \nand its ecological improvement in turn promotes ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, \nand water resources management of the YREB and its watersheds.  \n \n4. \nThe Xiangjiang River watershed has a total area of about 94,660 square kilometers, with \napproximately 90% of it located in Hunan and the remaining 10% located in the Guangxi Province. \nThe  economic  activity  and  expansion  of  the  human-made  surroundings  have  extensively \ndeveloped  the  Xiangjiang  River  watershed.  By  2017,  approximately  61%  of  Hunan\u2019s  total \npopulation,  or  about  25.1  million  people,  lived  within  the  watershed.  The  total  gross  domestic \nproduct for the Xiangjiang River watershed in 2017 was estimated to be 75% of the overall total \ngross domestic product of Hunan Province. The rapid economic growth experienced countrywide \nfrom  the  mid-1980s  until  the  present,  coupled  with  inadequate  environmental  protection, \ncontributes to the deterioration of the environment and the increased pollution in Hunan and the \nXiangjiang River watershed. By 2000, the surface water of the Xiangjiang River, which met class \nIII quality or better, was less than 70% along the entire river system.3 Based on the PRC drinking \nwater code, water along most reaches of the Xiangjiang River did not meet the standards to be \n\n                                                 \n1  The  project  includes  the  (i)  five  counties  of  Dong\u2019an,  Guiyang,  Hengshan,  Hengyang,  and  Lanshan;  and  (ii)  five \n\ncounty-level cities of Changning, Leiyang, Lengshuijiang, Yongzhou, and Zixing.  \n\n2   Government of the PRC. 2016. Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n3  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2002. Environmental Quality Standards for Surface \nWater. Beijing. There are five categories, with Class I being the highest quality of water and class V being the lowest \nquality. Class III is the minimum that can be used as a bulk source of raw water for production of drinking water. \n\n\fused as a source for raw water. The pollution in the Xiangjiang River had negative impacts on \nliving standards and the health of residents living around the river. The pollution was recognized \nby the government as a threat to the long-term sustainable growth of industry along the river, an \nimpediment to the maintenance of overall river health, a material risk to the strategic supplies for \ndownstream  drinking  water,  and  an  unacceptable  visual  intrusion  on  the  watershed's  well-\nrecognized cultural attraction. \n \n5. \nThe  main  sectors  responsible  for  the  Xiangjiang  River  watershed\u2019s  environmental \ndegradation  are  industry,  agriculture,  and  domestic  (with  domestic  sources  being  primarily \nmunicipal  wastewater  and  MSW).  In  the  period  2000\u20132017,  the  government  adopted  an \nintegrated approach to pollution control to protect water quality in the Xiangjiang River watershed. \nIn  2011,  the  Hunan  Provincial  Government  (HPG)  initiated  a  major  program  of  environmental \npollution control to target the major pollution sources.4 Subsequent environmental regulations and \nincremental  enforcement  in  Hunan  have  reduced  the  impacts  from  industrial  and  agricultural \nsources, and new wastewater treatment plants have reduced pollution from untreated sewage. \nHowever,  significant  challenges  remain  regarding  MSW.  Urbanization  has  left  a  legacy  of \nsubstandard landfill sites that were once in outlying rural areas and are now located close to newly \ncreated urban areas. Much of the countryside has been urbanized and has become part of the \nbuilt environment of the counties and county-level cities. With the expansion of MSW services \nbeing limited in these areas, the challenge of managing MSW in a sustainable manner has grown. \n \nAddressing the poor management of substandard landfill sites.5 Aging landfill sites, \n6. \nwhich are generally no longer receiving any MSW, are one of the last remaining long-term sources \nof  pollution  that  have  not  yet  been  fully  addressed  in  Hunan.  Most  of  these  landfill  sites  are \nreferred  to  as  substandard  MSW  landfills,  or  dumpsites,  meaning  they  were  not  planned, \nengineered, constructed, or operated to appropriate standards. They have been left untreated or \npartially sealed at various locations. They are typically closed in an operational sense. However, \nthey  have  not  been  closed  and  restored \nfor \ndecommissioning. 6  Because  they  were  not  closed  competently,  liquid  leachate  continues  to \npollute  surface  water  and  groundwater  and  the waste  is  also  releasing landfill  gas.7 The  liquid \nleachate and waste contribute to long-term pollution of the river system and downstream water \nquality by raising the biological and chemical oxygen demands, while gross pollution of the soil \nbelow the landfills remains unchecked. Without any form of managed closure, they will continue \nto generate leachate. The landfills pose risks to the health and well-being of people living near \nthem  and  are  a  safety  risk  to  anyone  accessing  them.  HPG  has  identified  59  landfills  in  the \nwatershed to be treated and improved by county and county-level city governments.8 While some \nlandfills have been treated under domestically funded projects, there are still untreated sites that \ncontinue  to  generate  leachate  when  rainfall  and  runoff  infiltrates  the  solid  waste  body,  further \ngenerating leachate from the natural process of waste decomposition. \n \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  best  practice \n\n                                                 \n4  HPG. 2011. Heavy Metal Pollution Management Project Implementation Plan in the Xiangjiang River Basin: 2011\u2013\n\n2015. Changsha. \n\n5  Before the mid-1980s, disposal of MSW in Hunan was rarely managed in accordance with best practice, and formal \nservices were rare. MSW was typically disposed of in so-called substandard landfill sites. The sites have become \ncontaminated resulting from gradual decomposition of buried waste, with consequent degradation of soil and water. \n6  Closure and restoration is an MSW industry recognized term, which describes the process of closing a site from an \nengineering and environmental perspective, including a process  of restoration using agreed design standards for \nfuture land use. It is not operational closure of a landfill site whereupon materials are no longer delivered to the site. \n\n7   As waste within a landfill decomposes, it generates leachate which is a highly polluting liquid contaminant. \n8  Hunan Provincial Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development Department (HURD). 2014. Existing Solid Waste Landfill \n\nRectification Planning for Xiangjiang River Watershed. Changsha. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f7. \nImprovement  of  inadequate  municipal  solid  waste  management  services  in  rural \nareas. Efficient MSW management, which promotes reduction (by waste minimization), reuse (of \nwaste  materials),  recycling,  and  recovery,  is  gaining  ground  in  the  PRC.  However,  the \nmanagement and disposal of MSW generated in rural areas is underdeveloped and inadequate. \nMost waste is randomly dumped onto open areas without treatment. In some cases, it is burned \nopenly, generating polluting emissions. Randomly dumped MSW allows waste to break down and \ndecompose  without  the  means  to  prevent  leachate  from  percolating  into  the  groundwater  or \nflowing into surface water bodies; indiscriminately dumped MSW can clog streams and drains. In \nthe PRC, MSW management focuses on urban areas. For vast rural areas, the management of \ndomestic waste is delegated to villagers. In 2016, HPG commenced the implementation of a five-\nyear plan for rural MSW treatment, which targeted the achievement of at least 70% of rural waste \nbeing  treated  by  2020.9 This  builds  on  rigorous  national  guidance  on  controlled  treatment  and \ndisposal  of  MSW. 10  It  supports  the  3-year  Action  Plan  for  Rural  Settlement  Environment \nRegulation  in  Hunan  Province  issued  by  HPG  in  2018  which  requires  comprehensive \nimplementation of enhanced services for rural sewage and waste treatment. In the rural areas of \nHunan, there has been some progress despite remaining limited and inconsistent. \n \n8. \nExpansion of municipal solid waste to include collection and treatment of kitchen \nwaste. HPG is also promoting the treatment of kitchen waste from commercial sources, which is \ntypically disposed of in landfills or in small dumpsites without treatment. However, because of its \nhigh water and protein content, kitchen waste tends to generate more leachate and greenhouse \ngas  emissions  than  other  MSW.  There  is  concern  about  unregulated  kitchen  waste  handling \nregarding food safety and its impacts on human health.11 According to a proposal raised in the \nHunan People\u2019s Congress,12 eight kitchen waste management projects have been proposed to \nrecover by-products for beneficial reuse, with due regard to public health and overall food safety. \n \n9. \nStrategic context. In the PRC's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the government\u2019s strategy is \nto intensify the control of water pollution and the protection of key watersheds.13 This includes the \necological  restoration  of  resource-depleted  areas  and  the  promotion  of  treating  pollutants  in \ncontaminated river basins. HPG is committed to meeting these obligations and to eliminating or \nminimizing  pollutants.  It  has  prioritized  reducing  long-term  pollution  and  promoting  the \ncomprehensive  treatment  and  effective  management  of  MSW. 14  HPG  focuses  on  landfill \nmanagement and MSW collection, transfer, and treatment in urban and rural areas. \n \n10. \nADB support. The project demonstrates alignment with the operational priorities of ADB \nStrategy  2030  particularly  in  terms  of  environmental  sustainability  and  integrated  solutions  for \nlivable  cities.  It  closely  supports  the  strategic  priorities  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9  HURD. 2016.

This dialogue has contributed to an enabling \nenvironment  that  has  facilitated  policy,  regulatory,  and  operational  improvements.  Starting  in \n2000, ADB supported the government in strengthening urban MSW through technical assistance \nprojects, which helped develop a national policy framework and plans for MSW and wastewater \nmanagement, focusing on small cities and towns. ADB has also provided specific support for the \ntreatment  of  substandard  landfills  in  the  PRC  and  for  the  environmental  management  of \nwatersheds  in  Hunan.  The  project  supports  HPG\u2019s  approach  to  urban\u2013rural  integrated  MSW \nmanagement,  which  seeks  to  address  the  entire  cycle  of  MSW  starting  in  households  with \ncollecting, separating, and recycling; and continuing in counties and cities with transferring and \ntreating  the  remaining  wastes.  It  covers  a  large  population  and  various  levels  of  government \nagencies. The engagement with multiple agencies is designed to drive ownership and build wide-\nranging capacity at the lowest administrative level and act as a model project. \n \n11. \nValue addition of ADB assistance. The PRC has adequate policies and regulations for \nMSW management to which ADB knowledge studies and technical assistance have contributed.16 \nThe implementation of these policies in rural areas, counties, and county-level cities has been a \nconstant  challenge.  HPG  recognizes  this  and  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  to  develop  an \ninvestment  project  in  rural  and  urban\u2013rural  areas,  which  is  intended  to  show  how  policy  and \nregulations can be translated into projects that follow best practices. This is intended to keep from \nduplicating past practices of low-cost interventions that deliver substandard outcomes. This builds \non  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  past  engagements,  showing  the  demand  for  clear  statements  on  best \npractice  and  for  robust  technical  guidance  and  support.  ADB\u2019s  presence  offers  a  unique \nopportunity to deliver numerous projects under one overarching project, wholly focused on MSW, \nto  allow  collaboration  and  comparative  assessment.  ADB\u2019s  focused  support  on  a  chronically \nunderserved sector allows it to be comprehensively addressed. ADB\u2019s engagement assists the \ngovernment  in  the  last  stage  of  providing  MSW  services  and  in  addressing  overlooked  aging \nlandfills. The government and ADB have designed the project collaboratively to have a sharper \nfocus  on  consistent,  effective,  and  innovative  approaches  with  a  high  potential  for  replication, \nbased  on  the  best  international  and  national  practices.  This  enhanced  design  development \nbroadened the project\u2019s scope while adopting more holistic and strategic approaches, leading to \nimproved MSW service outcomes and the adoption of appropriate high-level technologies with \nlarge-scale demonstration potential, including (i) practical and environmentally sound approaches \nto landfill closure and restoration, building on recent codes of practice;17 (ii) robust operational \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB.  2016.

The appraisal included a consideration of rationale and \nrelevance, benefits, proposed designs, life cycle costs, capital and operational expenditure, and \nease  of  implementation  and  operation.  The  due  diligence  confirmed  the  project  is  technically \nfeasible and addresses key issues and complies with the PRC guidelines and regulations. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis.27 An economic analysis was prepared for the overall project and all \n24. \nsubprojects following ADB guidelines. The benefits considered are (i) improved environment and \nhealth  valued  by  project  beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  landfill  works  and  MSW  services, \n(ii) reduced health risks measured by savings in disability-adjusted life years, and (iii) the resale \nvalue of waste byproducts.28 The estimated economic internal rates of return are 15.3% for the \nproject  and 10.8%\u201319.7%  for  the  individual  subprojects,  higher  than  the  economic opportunity \ncost of capital estimated at 9.0%, indicating significant economic returns. A sensitivity analysis \nconfirms rates remain robust under various downward risk scenarios, with the project likely to be \neconomically viable even under combined risk scenarios because unquantifiable benefits were \nnot included in the analysis.29 \n \nFinancial  analysis.30 A  financial  analysis  was  prepared  for  the  overall  project  and  all \n25. \nsubprojects  following  ADB  guidelines,  which  included  the  financial  evaluation  of  the  revenue-\ngenerating  components  and  assessments  of  financial  management  and  sustainability. 31 The \nfinancial evaluation result indicated that only the kitchen waste and three out of the seven MSW \ncomponents are financially viable because Hunan municipalities are still embedding the MSW fee \nin the water bill;32 for these four, the financial internal rates of return (4.02%\u20135.22%) are higher \nthan the respective weighted average costs of capital (2.76%\u20133.11%). The municipalities will fund \nthe financial gap to cover the O&M costs of the components. Financial sustainability was based \non the fiscal impact of (i) counterpart funding; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs, including O&M \nexpenditure. The analysis confirmed the financial sustainability of the project, with fiscal impacts, \nwell within the governments\u2019 projected revenue capacities. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nA  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  for  the  Hunan  Provincial  Housing \nand  Urban\u2013Rural  Development  Department  (HURD)  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nfinancial  management  risk  is  moderate  mainly  because  of  the  (i)  financial  position  of  the \nimplementing  agencies  to  independently  finance  counterpart  funding;  (ii)  project  management \n                                                 \n27 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 During implementation, the final determination will be made on the type of commercial product to be developed for \nresale.

In rural areas, fees are not typically collected, and services are provided by municipal governments. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\noffice  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  unfamiliarity  with  ADB  financial  management  policy  and \nprocedures;  and  (iii)  implementing  agencies\u2019  lack  of  accounting  staff  for  review  procedures.  A \nprocurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for the project is \nmoderate. The project is not the first externally financed development project in Hunan. However, \nit is the first for HURD and all of the implementing agencies except for Zixing. HURD confirmed it \nwill receive advice and support from other HPG agencies, which have experience implementing \nADB projects. The procurement of civil works and goods, including the recruitment of consultants, \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).33 \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and HURD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nD. \n \nThe project will directly provide benefits to the project communities by (i) improving the \n28. \nliving  conditions  and  public  health  of  residents,  (ii)  enhancing  awareness  of  sustainable  MSW \nmanagement, and (iii) providing access to employment opportunities created by the project. \n \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  some  gender  elements.  The  social  and  gender  impact \n29. \nassessment showed that since women are responsible for cleaning, laundry, food preparation, \nand overall family and environmental health, they are more exposed to health risks and they carry \nthe burden of personal and family illness. A social and gender action plan has been prepared to \nensure  that  (i)  women  are  continuously  consulted,  and  gender  concerns  and  suggestions  are \nincorporated  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  MSW  systems;  (ii)  women  are  actively \nparticipating  in  community  awareness  raising,  education  programs,  and  training  on  the  3Rs \nprinciple;  and  (iii)  project  benefits  are  maximized  by  providing  better  access  to  employment \nopportunities  associated  with  the  project.  The  social  and  gender  action  plan  aims  to  minimize \nhealth risks and sexual harassment during construction by including clauses in the contracts to \nlimit HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and to prohibit sexual harassment. This \nwill be supported by robust activities to prevent HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and \nsexual harassment and complemented by a carefully targeted education campaign. \n \nE. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.34 \n \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  environment.  An \n31. \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA), including an environmental management plan (EMP), \nwas  prepared  by  HURD.35 The  EIA  incorporated  findings  of  the  domestic  feasibility  study  and \ndomestic EIAs, climate risks and vulnerability assessment, biodiversity assessment, site visits, \nand consultations with stakeholders. The EIA identified potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and \ninduced environmental impacts and risks for preconstruction, construction, and operation phases \nof the project.36 The EMP identifies the avoidance of adverse impacts through design and site \n                                                 \n33 During implementation, the executing agency will have the option to change to ADB\u2019s new Procurement Framework. \n34 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n35 The EIA main report, with appendixes 1\u20133, was disclosed on 25 May 2018, and appendix 4 on 28 May 2018. \n36 These include anticipated impacts from excavation; handling of leachate and solid waste; groundwater and surface \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\nwater pollution; and closure of landfill sites with potential for air, soil, and water pollution. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement and mitigation measures under construction management. The landfill closures and \nnew  MSW  systems  have  been  considered  in  detail,  including  potential  impacts  for  landfill  gas \ncollection and treatment. During the EIA process, HURD conducted an assessment to determine \nthe significance of project impacts and risks on biodiversity and natural resources, and the EMP \nincludes  adequate  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  potential  impacts  and  risks.  The \nclimate change assessment (para. 33) identified precipitation and flooding as the most important \nrisks affecting the project, and key recommendations have been incorporated in the EMP. \n \nThe EMP includes a plan for internal monitoring to be conducted by contractors during \n32. \nconstruction and by O&M units during operation. The project management office will recruit an \nexternal monitoring entity to evaluate and assess implementation and compliance with the EMP \nduring  all  stages  of  the  project.37 Environmental  management,  and  capacity  development  and \ninstitutional strengthening activities are included under the project to mitigate risks. Two rounds \nof  meaningful  consultations  have  been  conducted  with  all  relevant  stakeholders  during  project \npreparation,  and  the  findings  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  Any  potential \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress \nmechanism  established  for  the  project.  The  EIA  concluded  that  the  anticipated  environmental \nimpacts and risks can be mitigated to acceptable levels by adherence to prescribed training and \ncapacity-building measures and effective implementation of the EMP. \n \nClimate change assessment. According to defined projections for 2046\u20132065 and 2081\u2013\n33. \n2100 and the global climate model representative concentration pathways, the major climate risk \nfor  the  project  is  intense  precipitation,  with  more  frequent  flooding.38 Although  the  behavior  of \nlandfill emissions under regular operating conditions is well known, it is unclear how they behave \nduring flood events. During such events, closed and operational landfills may release pollutants \noriginally entombed in the waste body. Project outputs 1, 2, and 3 are an investment response to \nthe climate vulnerability of the watershed, and these adaptation measures will reduce the risk of \npollutant diffusion in extreme climatic events, mainly flooding.39 \n \n34. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The project will require the acquisition of about \n23.5  ha  of  land  for  the  project  facilities.  Based  on  the  principle  of  avoiding,  if  not  minimizing, \nimpacts  and,  in  consultation  with  the  communities,  only  three  households  will  be  marginally \naffected because of the partial loss of their garden and forest lands. The rest of the facilities will \nbe located on common land (wasteland or unallocated arable and forest land) owned by villagers. \nThere will be no impact on houses or structures except for one abandoned village office. There \nare  six  resettlement  plans  that  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  laws  and \nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  For  the  existing  waste  transfer  stations, \nlandfill sites, and kitchen waste sites, due diligence has been completed and no outstanding issue \nwas found. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  In  the  project  areas,  there  are  0.64  million  ethnic \n35. \nminorities, accounting for 10% of the total ethnic minority population in Hunan. The Miao, Yao, \nand Zhuang are the main ethnic minority groups that are concentrated in the remote upland areas \nof Lanshan County under the prefecture of Yongzhou City. There will be no adverse impact on \nethnic minorities (i.e., no involuntary resettlements and no impact on ethnic minorities\u2019 beliefs, \n\n                                                 \n37 More comprehensive site assessment and monitoring will be conducted during detailed design to characterize the \n\nwaste and to monitor groundwater quality and soil contamination in and around the landfill sites. \n\n38 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2014.
