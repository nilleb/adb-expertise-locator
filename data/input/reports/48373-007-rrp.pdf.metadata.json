The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Strengthening Bridge Operation and Management Project, and \nif the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated to me  by  the \nBoard, approve the TA.1 \n \nThe project will construct a new road bridge (the new Ganga Bridge) across the Ganges \n2. \nRiver and an integrated approach roadway network in the state of Bihar. It will improve transport \nconnectivity  between  north  and  south  Bihar,  which  is  divided  by  the  Ganges  River,  and  better \nlink Patna, the state capital city, and the surrounding areas. The main bridge structure of about \n9.8  kilometers  (km)  is  expected  to  become  the  longest  river  bridge  in  India.  It  will  have  a \ntransformational  impact  by  promoting  the  geographical  integration  of  Bihar,  and  help  balance \nthe  benefits  of  social  economic  development.  In  the  regional  context,  it  is  strategically  located \nnear India\u2019s neighboring country of Nepal, and will enhance the existing road corridors between \nthe two countries. This will lead to greater physical cross-border connectivity, which is supported \nby the Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nBihar  is  the  12th  largest  state  in  India  by  area,  the  3rd  most  populous  with  about \n104 million  inhabitants,  and  the  6th  most  densely  populated.  It  is  in  the  eastern  region  of  the \ncountry,  bordering  Uttar  Pradesh  in  the  west,  West  Bengal  in  the  east,  and  Jharkhand  in  the \nsouth.  The  Ganges  River  flows  through  the  middle  of  the  Bihar  plain  from  west  to  east, \nphysically dividing the state into northern and southern regions. The northern region is bound by \nNepal.  Bihar  has  lagged  behind  other  states  in  terms  of  social  and  economic  development. \nAccording  to  Government  of  India  estimates  based  on  2011\u20132012  data,  34%  of  Bihar\u2019s \npopulation lives below the poverty line, compared with 22% nationally.3 Bihar continues to be at \nthe  bottom  among  major  states  in  India  with  per  capita  income  in  2013\u20132014  of  only  39% \n(Rs15,650) of the national average (Rs39,904), although the gap has since narrowed thanks to \nincreased investment in social infrastructure and improved governance.4 \n \n4. \nThe  problem  of  low  per  capita  income  in  Bihar  is  accentuated  by  the  physical  north\u2013\nsouth  divide.  In  2012,  district-wise  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  was  on  average  40% \nhigher among districts in the south (footnote 4). Among the 38 districts of the state, 7 of the 10 \nmost prosperous districts were in the south, while 7 of the 10 poorest districts were in the north. \nThis  disparity  is  clearly  attributed  to  the  Ganges  River  and  its  enormous  scale,  which  makes \nproviding  connectivity  between  north  and  south Bihar  a  very  difficult  task.  Currently,  along the \nentire  length  of  the  Ganges  River  in  Bihar  (approximately  200  km),  only  four  bridges  are \noperational, and the combined capacity is far too limited to meet traffic demand.5 This not only \nconstrains connectivity but also overall socioeconomic development.6 \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n3   Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013. Press Note on Poverty Estimates, 2011\u20132012. Delhi. \n4   Government of Bihar, Finance Department. 2015. Economic Survey, 2014\u20132015. Patna. \n5   As  shown  on  the  map,  three  bridges  are  between  north  and  south  Bihar  (Gandhi  Setu,  Rajendra  Setu,  and \n\nVikramshila Setu), and one bridge is between south Bihar at Buxar and the state of Uttar Pradesh in the west. \n6   The combined volume\u2013capacity ratio is currently about 1.6\u2014already three times higher than the desired level. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nFour new bridges are under construction at critical locations to help remove the growing \n5. \nconstraint on connectivity.7 Moreover, the proposed project will construct a new Ganga Bridge, \nlocated  about  10  km  downstream  and  east  of  Patna.  The  main  objective  is  to  provide  badly \nneeded additional capacity, and improve connectivity for Patna and the surrounding areas. This \nincludes the Raghopur Diara river island, which is situated and cut off in between two channels \nof  the  Ganges  River.  Its  250,000  inhabitants  now  have  only  a  seasonal  link  (pontoon  bridge) \nconnecting it to Patna, apart from boats. The new Ganga Bridge will span the entire width of the \nGanges  River,  including  the  two  channels,  with  access  ramps  to  the  Raghopur  Diara  river \nisland, and connect to nearby national highways along the north and south banks of the Ganges \nRiver.  It  will  also  serve  as  an  alternative  to  the  existing  Ganga  Bridge  (also  called  Mahatma \nGandhi Bridge), which currently is the main link between Patna and north Bihar. The old bridge \nis deteriorating and has insufficient capacity, which sees severe traffic congestion.8 \n \n6. \nThe new Ganga Bridge, together with the other bridges already under construction, will \nprovide the required transport capacity between north and south Bihar, and significantly improve \nconnectivity. It will substantially reduce the travel time to Patna from the surrounding regions, in \nparticular  north  Bihar,  which  will  ease  access to  the  state\u2019s  administrative  and social  services, \nand health and higher education facilities. The inhabitants of the Raghopur Diara river island will \ngain  year-round  road  access,  allowing  children  access  to  higher-level  schooling  and  women \nbetter access to pre- and postnatal health care. It will help balance the benefits of developments \nin agriculture, tourism, and industrial sectors, and contribute to achieving the priority goal of the \nGovernment of Bihar\u2014to connect Patna to the remotest areas in the state, so that people can \nreach the capital in no more than 6 hours from any place within the state.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Bihar  has  stepped  up  investments  in  the  development  of  quality \n7. \ninfrastructure. Since 2008, ADB has provided three loans totaling $1.02 billion to upgrade 1,466 \nkm  of  state  highways  in  north  and  south  Bihar,  linking  rural  areas  to  national  highways.  With \nthese  collectively,  the  new  Ganga  Bridge  will  improve  mobility  and  accessibility  between  north \nand south Bihar, and is critical to ensuring that the overall development impact is optimized and \nits benefits are fully reaped. The new bridge is integral to the vision and action plan of the Road \nMaster Plan for Bihar\u2019s State Highways Development, a 20-year strategy (2015\u20132035) prepared \nwith ADB assistance to direct further investment into fostering overall economic development in \nthe state.9 \n \n8. \nRegional  connectivity.  In  the  context  of  regional  connectivity  with  India\u2019s  neighboring \ncountries,  the  new  Ganga  Bridge  is  strategically  located  at  about  190  km  southeast  from \nRaxaul, an Indian border town across from Birgunj in Nepal, which enables major cross-border \nmovement  of  goods  and  people  between  the  two  countries.  The  bridge  will  allow  better \ndistribution  of  traffic  on  the  road  network,  which  includes  the  international  and  regional  trade \ncorridors that connect Nepal to the eastern, northern, and northeastern states of India, including \naccess  to  ports  at  Kolkata  and  Haldia  in  West  Bengal. 10  The  project  complements  ADB\u2019s \nongoing support to the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation.11 \n                                                \n7   As shown on the map, two bridges by the Government of Bihar (Arrah\u2013Chhapra and Bakhiarpur, to be operational \nin 2018), and two rail-cum-road bridges by the Government of India (Digha and Munger, to be operational in 2017). \n8   Urgent repairs are being made to maintain operations on the Ganga Bridge, albeit at reduced capacity, while the \n\nGovernment of India is considering options for its complete rehabilitation. \n\n9   ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Road Master Plan for Bihar\u2019s State Highway Development. Manila (TA 8170-\n\nIND, $1,000,000, approved on 20 September). \n\n10  Asian Highway No. 42, which is also the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Corridor 2. \n11 The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program is a project-based partnership that aims to strengthen \ncross-border  transport  networks  that  boost  intraregional  trade  in  the  subregion  (Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  the \nMaldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka). \n\n\fSustainable  maintenance.  In  2013,  the  Government  of  Bihar  enacted  the  Bihar  Road \n9. \nAssets Maintenance Policy, which requires the execution of maintenance works throughout the \ndesign  life  of  road  infrastructure  in  place  and  under  construction.  The  annual  maintenance \nbudget has more than doubled\u2014from Rs3.500 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2012 to Rs8.932 billion \nin FY2015\u2014thanks to increasing revenue from vehicle registration and license fees. Long-term \nperformance-based  maintenance  by  the  private  sector  is  also  being  encouraged  to  provide \ngreater  efficiency.  In  keeping  with  this,  the  contract  for  the  new  Ganga  Bridge  also  includes \npost-completion  performance-based  maintenance  for  5  years,  to  be  financed  by  the  state \ngovernment. This  approach,  and  a  contract modality  that  combines  engineering,  procurement, \nand construction, optimizes incentives for design and construction quality while allowing the use \nof  best  practices  and  innovations  for  efficiency  and  economy.  It  emphasizes  efficient  use  of \navailable resources, and this is consistent with one of ADB\u2019s strategic drivers of change being \nadapted in the development of the private sector. \n \n10. \nClimate  change  resilience.  The  probability  analysis  of  rainfall  extremes  over  the \nGanges  basin  has  shown  a  growing  trend  in  maximum  1-day  rainfall  and  in  the  count  of \nconsecutive rainfall days.12 In view of this, the new Ganga Bridge will span from bank to bank \nover the two river channels and the Raghopur Diara river island. This helps minimize effects on \nthe river regime and is an important climate adaptation measure because the alternative option \nof constructing an embankment road on Raghopur Diara river island, while less costly, could be \nvulnerable to floods. The bridge will also meet the navigation clearance requirements of India\u2019s \nInland  Waterways  Authority,  e.g.,  vertical  clearance  of  10 meters  from  the  highest  recorded \nflood  level,  and  horizontal  clearance  of  100  meters  between  two  piers  of  the  bridge.  This  is \nmaintained  throughout  the  entire  bridge  length  to  accommodate  the  possibility  of  any  future \nchanges in the river morphology and meandering of the river channels. \n \n11. \nFinance plus. The new Ganga Bridge will have a transformational impact by promoting \nthe  geographical  integration  of  Bihar  and  helping  balance  the  benefits  of  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. It will also have a systemic impact on large-scale bridge design and construction \nin  India  by  introducing  new  engineering  and  technology,  a first  of  its kind  and scale  in India.13 \nThis  also  includes  the  implementation  of  stringent  environmental  safeguard  measures,  and  a \nbiodiversity  conservation  plan  that  will  monitor  changes  to  the  local  biodiversity  in  the  project \narea and implement conservation activities to avoid any net loss of biodiversity as a result of the \nproject.  These  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  a  joint  venture  of  reputed  international  and \nnational  design\u2013build  contractors,  and  supervised  by  international  and  national  experts, \ncomprising a project management consulting team. This will enable the local industries to gain \nvaluable experience and know-how that can be replicated for greater benefits in the future. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be improved mobility and accessibility within India, and connectivity with \n12. \nits  neighboring  countries. 14 The  outcome  will  be  improved  transport  connectivity  across  the \nGanges River between north and south Bihar. \n \n\n                                                \n12  Project  Climate  Risk  Assessment  and  Management  Reporting  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n13  The  adopted  extradosed  bridge  design  incorporates  characteristics  of  a  cable-stayed  and  externally  stressed \nconcrete-box segmental structure, which optimizes economy and efficiency.

The key outputs and activities involve \n(i)  preparing  an  operation  management  plan  for  the  new  Ganga  Bridge  that  covers \ncomprehensively  all  relevant  aspects,  including  administration  and  organization,  user  services \nand  quality,  inspection,  and  maintenance  procedures;  (ii)  developing  a  model  maintenance \nmanual  for  major  bridges  in  about  four  selected  districts,  which  can  be  replicated  for  other \n                                                \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ndistricts  in  the  state  and  which  includes  conducting  condition  surveys,  prioritizing maintenance \nrequirements, preparing cost estimates, and formulating a rolling work plan and budget; and (iii) \nlearning  international  best  practices,  including  on-the-job  training  of  managers  and  technical \nstaff  during  the  above  TA  activities,  in-house  technical  workshops,  and  overseas  training, \nincluding case studies and observations.16 \n \n20. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The Government of \nBihar  acting  through  BSRDCL  will  be  the  executing  agency.  BSRDCL  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe TA will be implemented from January 2017 to December 2018. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe location and alignment of the bridge and the approach road network are considered \n21. \nbest among the alternatives reviewed during project preparation given the existing road network \npattern,  as  well  as  minimal  land  acquisition,  dislocation,  and  environmental  impact.  A \nhydrological survey of the Ganges River in the influence area was conducted and the historical \ndata  was  collected  from  the  Central  Water  Commission,  which  established  the  basis  for  the \nhydraulic  design  parameters,  such  as  the  river  discharge  and  highest  flood  level.  The  main \nstructure adopted is an extradosed bridge, which incorporates characteristics of cable stay and \nexternally prestressed concrete box segmental structure, optimizing economy and efficiency for \nconstruction  and  maintenance  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  design  standards. \nThe environmental management plan includes provisions requiring the contractor to ensure the \nsafety of workers and mitigate the accident risk from construction activities. \n \nRoad safety. The project management and authority engineer team will conduct a road \n22. \nsafety  audit  and  assessment,  and  make  sure  that  any  countermeasures  proposed  are \nincorporated in the detailed design. The team will also collaborate with a local nongovernment \norganization (NGO) to be engaged by BSRDCL for rehabilitation and resettlement activities. The \nNGO will also conduct road safety awareness campaigns in the local communities and secure \nthe participation of women and school teachers for dissemination to children. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  by  comparing  the  societal  cost  of  transportation \nwith  and  without  the  project,  considering  the  benefits  of  better  connectivity  between  north  and \nsouth  Bihar  as  well  as  all-year  connectivity  to  Raghopur  Diara  river  island  and  its  250,000 \ninhabitants.  The  project  will  add  capacity  across  the  Ganges  River  and  enable  shorter  travel \ntimes within its influence area. The added capacity will help decrease traffic on other bridges up- \nand  downstream,  thus  reducing  congestion,  improving  travel  times,  and  lowering  vehicle \noperating  costs  on  these  bridges.  The  analysis  also  considered  the  transport  cost  savings  to \ninhabitants of the Raghopur Diara river island. Without the project, those inhabitants depend on \nboats for most of the year and a seasonal pontoon bridge, making the transport of passengers \nand goods very costly, and reducing the residents\u2019 ability to market the produce from their fertile \nland.  Taking  into  account  the  benefits  arising  from  the  project,  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn is estimated at 16%, indicating that the project is viable in social cost\u2013benefit terms. The \n\n                                                \n16  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fsensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes \nin  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  project\u2019s  costs  and  benefits.  The  economic  viability \nremained  satisfactory  at  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.7-14.9%  above  the  12% \ncutoff.  The  project  will  also  provide  large  additional  benefits  to  the  residents  of  the  Raghopur \nDiara  river  island  in  terms  of  better  access  to  education  and  health  facilities,  and  increased \nmarketability of their produce, thus improving their socioeconomic situation. \n \n24. \nThe Government of Bihar intends to collect user fees in the form of toll charges, except \nfor  traffic  from  Raghopur  Diara  river  island.  A  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  to  assess  the \nviability of meeting the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. It was done on an incremental \nbasis  using  the  discounted  cash  flow  method  and  calculating  the  internal  rate  of  return  of  the \nproject. The capital cost includes construction of the bridge and its approaches. The O&M cost \nincludes routine and periodic maintenance of the facility created. All financial projections are in \n2015 nominal Indian rupees with no adjustment for inflation. The estimated financial internal rate \nof return for the  project  in  real  terms  is  4.6%,  which  is  above the  estimated  weighted  average \ncost  of  capital  of  2.3%.  The  cash  flow  projections  indicate  that  the  project  would  generate \nsufficient liquid cash resources to allow the project to meet its O&M costs and meet debt service \nobligations over the analysis period. BSRDCL\u2019s financial health is in good standing overall.17 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management.  A \n\n25. \nPolicy,  legal,  and  institutional  capacity. BSRDCL was incorporated on 20 April 2009 \nunder the Companies Act of 1956, and is a wholly owned company of the Government of Bihar, \nestablished  to  develop,  execute,  manage,  and  maintain  all  types  of  roads,  highways,  and \nbridges. BSRDCL has an 11-member board of directors and is headed by a managing director, \nwith  about  108  staff  members.18 The  corporate  structure  was  developed  along  good-practice \nprinciples,  and  a  sound  culture  is  emerging  with  an  understanding  of  company  values,  which \naim  to  provide  high-class  standards  with  regard  to  safety,  performance,  and  user  satisfaction, \nand to operate under sound ethical standards. \n \n26. \nfinancial  management  assessment  was  conducted, \nconsidering  the  capacity  of  BSRDCL,  including  fund-flow  arrangements,  governance,  staffing, \nbudgeting,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  control  procedures,  financial \ninformation  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  BSRDCL  follows  a \ndouble-entry,  accrual  accounting  and  reporting  process,  in  accordance  with  the  generally \naccepted  accounting  principles  in  India,  and  in  compliance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the \nCompanies  Act  of  2013  to  the  extent  applicable.  BSRDCL  is  experienced  and  familiar  with \nmanaging  ADB-financed  projects.  Further \nto  reporting  procedures  and \naccounting software are described in the PAM. The overall financial management arrangements \nare considered satisfactory, and the overall risk is moderate. \n \n27. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption  measures. All  procurement of goods and works will \nbe undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto  time).  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  BSRDCL.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nimprovements \n\n                                                \n17  The recurrent cost for the project is about 2.8% of BSRDCL\u2019s annual expenditure. \n18  The current managing director is the secretary of the Road Construction Department. The board is chaired by the \n\ndevelopment commissioner of the Government of Bihar. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nA  poverty  and  social  survey  of  366  households  was  conducted,  and  8  focus  group \ndiscussions were held in 18 villages. Respondents felt that the project would make access and \nmobility  more  reliable.  The  project  will  greatly  benefit  northern  Bihar,  including  the  Raghopur \nDiara river island, where socioeconomic indicators are low and the lack of reliable connectivity \nhas hindered growth and development. Improved cross-river connectivity will allow residents in \nthe  north  to  transport their  products more quickly  to  market  centers  in  the  south,  and  will  also \nimprove  their  profit  margins  since  they  will  no  longer  depend  solely  on  local  markets  and \nmiddlemen,  or  face  long  transport  times.  An  estimated  9.3  million  people  live  in  the  project \ndistricts and will experience the economic benefits brought about by the project.19 \n \nGender  and  development. Most women in the project area are involved in household \n29. \nwork. The project will improve connectivity, giving them better access to health services, higher \nlevels  of  education,  economic  opportunities,  and  social  interactions.  Women  living  on  the \nnorthern banks of the Ganges River and on the Raghopur Diara island will benefit in particular. \nLand acquisition and resettlement will affect 56 households headed by women. Special attention \nwill be given to these households to ensure that they are equally well or better off than before \nthe  project.  Meaningful  consultations  with  women  guided  the  design  of  practical  and \nimplementable  gender-proactive  features:  (i)  gender-sensitive  design  of  project  components, \nincluding  separate  toilets  and  rest  areas  for  men  and  women,  and  lighting  for  pedestrians; \n(ii) grassroots  road  safety  and  safe  mobility  campaigns  involving  the  participation  of  women, \nwith a target of 30% as trained facilitators and 50% as beneficiaries; and (iii) awareness training \non  issues  related  to  sexually  transmitted  infections  for  all  project-affected  communities  and  all \ncontractors\u2019 staff before and during construction, targeting a 50% participation rate for women. \nCivil  works contracts  will  have  provisions  to  ensure that  all  applicable  labor  laws  are  complied \nwith,  including  equal  pay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Contractors  are  also \nencouraged to employ local women. \n \n30. \nHIV/AIDS and trafficking. Bihar is characterized as a low-HIV-prevalence state with an \nestimated  adult  HIV  prevalence  of  0.20%,  lower  than  the  national  rate  of  0.27%.  Of  123,873 \npeople  in  Bihar  estimated  to  be  living  with  HIV/AIDS,  39%  are  women.  Major  efforts  in \nawareness building, prevention, and treatment are undertaken by the health department and the \nBihar AIDS Control Society at the state, district, and block levels. Based on public consultations, \nthe  project  incorporates  measures  to  mitigate  HIV/AIDS  risks,  such  as  NGOs  undertaking \nsemiannual  awareness  programs  at  construction  sites  and  in  project-influenced  areas,  in \nparticular  at  important  village  locations  and  in  schools  and  offices.  Awareness-building  will  be \nconducted separately for men and women to discuss gender-specific issues. To combat the risk \nof  human  trafficking,  the  Government  of  Bihar  launched  a  program  in  2007  to  prevent  the \ntrafficking of women and children and to ensure comprehensive rehabilitation for victims. Also, \ninternational NGOs are implementing awareness-building and prevention programs in Bihar. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n31. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  because  of  the  presence  of  the  Gangetic  Dolphin  and  the \nGanges softshell turtle, and the potential presence of the Gharial in the project area. According \nto the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Gangetic Dolphin is endangered, Ganges \nsoftshell turtle is vulnerable, and Gharial is critically endangered. They are also protected under \n\n                                                \n19  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fthe Wildlife  Protection  Act  of  India.  Although  the  project  area  is  not  a  critical  habitat  for  these \nspecies,  the  large  project  scope  requires  sourcing,  transport,  and  storage  of  substantial \nconstruction,  labor,  equipment,  and  material  resources.  The  draft  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  1  December  2015.  Potential  significant \nimpacts entail destruction and disturbance of the natural habitat from on-site noise, vibration, air \nand water pollution, and increased sediment load in the river. The location, timing, and method \nof  construction  will  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  on  the  natural  habitat.  A  biodiversity \nconservation  plan  will  be  implemented  to  avoid  any  net  loss  of  biodiversity.  Other  anticipated \nimpacts  involve  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  construction  and  domestic  waste,  water  contamination, \noccupational  health  and  safety,  erosion,  siltation,  and  traffic  congestion.  Measures  to  manage \nthese have been included in the environmental management plan, which will be updated by the \ncontractor.  Meaningful  consultations  were  held  with  affected  persons  and  key  stakeholders, \nsuch  as  the  local  Forestry  Department,  Zoological  Survey  of  India,  Patna  University,  and  the \nWorld  Wildlife  Fund,  and  their  recommendations  were  incorporated  in  the  EIA.  The  EIA\u2019s \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  further  alleviate  any  concerns  of  affected  persons  and \nrelevant stakeholders during project implementation. \n \n32. \nBSRDCL will be responsible for ensuring the implementation of environment safeguards \nunder the project. Two technical managers of the bridge construction works will be responsible \nfor  managing  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  project  management  and  authority \nengineer  team  will  include  an  environmental  and  biodiversity  specialist  to  supervise  the \nimplementation of environment safeguards. The civil works contractor will employ environmental \nexperts  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  the EIA  and the  environmental  management  plan. \nAn external monitor will be recruited to conduct third-party monitoring of the implementation and \nthe  biodiversity \nsupervision  of  environmental  safeguards,  and \nconservation  plan.  The  project  management  and  authority  engineer  team  will  conduct  training \nworkshops and on-site training on how to implement environment safeguards for BSRDCL staff \nand the contractor. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is classified as category A in accordance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Project components are designed to minimize land acquisition and \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  line  with  the  Right  to  Fair \nCompensation  and  Transparency  in  Land  Acquisition,  Rehabilitation,  and  Resettlement  Act \n(2013), and the Safeguard Policy Statement, and has been disclosed.20 About 256.58 acres of \nprivate  land  will  be  acquired,  affecting  18,171  persons  or  1,594  households,  and  153  private \nstructures.  Of  the  households,  1,509  will  experience  economic  displacement  and  85  will \nexperience physical displacement. Displaced persons will be compensated at replacement cost, \nand rates for different categories of loss and special assistance are detailed in the resettlement \nplan.  The  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  about  $127.6  million.  Impacts \nhave  been  thoroughly  assessed,  and  the  measures  proposed  in  the  resettlement  plan  are \ncommensurate to the assessed impacts. BSRDCL is experienced in implementing ADB projects \nand is committed to implementing the resettlement plan. BSRDCL will engage an NGO to assist \nwith  implementing  the  resettlement  plan,  and  the  project  management  and  authority  engineer \nteam\u2019s resettlement specialist will be the external monitor. \n \n34. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is categorized as C in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Due diligence confirms that no indigenous peoples are present in the project \nimpact area. \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n20 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\nhttp://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ind-bihar-new-ganga-bridge-project-dec-2015-rp \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  low,  while  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProject startup is delayed \nand disbursement is \nslow. \n\nImplementation capacity \nis not adequate. \n\nMaintenance and future \ncapacity for bridge \noperation and \nmanagement is weak. \n\nThe advanced procurement action was expedited in accordance with ADB \nrequirements under retroactive financing. An EPC contract for the bridge and \napproach road network was signed on 10 February 2016, and the PMAE \nconsultant contract was signed on 8 April 2016. \nThe PMAE team will support BSRDCL by providing overall project \nmanagement support and monitoring implementation of safeguard measures, \nincluding EMP and other requirements related to environmental protection. \nThe EPC contract includes 5 years of post-completion performance-based \nbridge maintenance services to be financed by the Government of Bihar.
