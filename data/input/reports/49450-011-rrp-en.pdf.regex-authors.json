BACKGROUND \n \n1.  On 22 June 2017, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility.1 The facility will finance renewable energy \nprojects in 11 Pacific developing member countries with an overall estimated cost of $750 million, \nincluding ADB financing of up to $200 million. Upon approval, the Board delegated authority to \nthe President to approve loans and/or grants to each targeted country for qualifying projects. \n \n2.  The grant to the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Energy Security Project will be \nfinanced under the facility. \n \n3.  The project will rehabilitate the Majuro tank farm (MTF), the fuel handling and storage \nfacilities built in 1981 and operated by Marshalls Energy Company (MEC) on Majuro Atoll. The \nMTF comprises eight 750,000-gallon (2.84 million-liter) above-ground steel storage tanks, two \nsmaller intermediate transfer tanks, and associated piping and pumping infrastructure. Power \ngeneration throughout the Marshall Islands is dependent on fuel delivered by MEC through the \nMTF, as is domestic and international maritime transport operating in Marshall Islands waters. \nThe MTF has become dilapidated because of the harsh operating environment and chronic \ninadequate maintenance practices and budgeting. The project will return the MTF to compliance \nwith applicable industry standards and will institute policies and operating practices (including \npersonnel training) to provide for appropriate maintenance to ensure its sustainability. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n4.  Macroeconomic  context.  The  Marshall  Islands  is  heavily  dependent  on  external \nassistance, with annual grants averaging 60% of gross domestic product (GDP), mostly through \nthe Compact of Free Association (COFA) with the United States, which terminates in 2023. \nUnemployment is high and human development indicators are generally low; income distribution \nis quite uneven and poverty on the outer atolls is considerable. When grant flows from the COFA \ndeclined during 1995\u20132001, per capita GDP over the same period dropped by nearly 35%. \nEconomic growth accelerated from 0.6% in FY2015 to 1.5% in FY2016 because of stronger \nfisheries output and the resumption of infrastructure projects connected with the COFA. ADB \nestimates growth of 4.0% in FY2017 and forecasts 2.5% in FY2018,2 and an economic review \nprepared through Graduate School USA expects average GDP growth of 1.7% through FY2025.3 \n \n5.  Renewable energy investment demand. MEC is a fully state-owned electricity utility that \ngenerates, distributes, and retails electricity on Majuro to a population of about 28,000 (roughly \nhalf of the Marshall Islands\u2019 population). Serving the country\u2019s capital, the Majuro system accounts \nfor 72% of electricity generated and consumed in the Marshall Islands. Ebeye in Kwajalein Atoll \naccounts for an additional 24%, while the outer islands make up the balance. Renewable power \ngeneration in the Marshall Islands is negligible; nearly all power delivered to customers on Majuro \nis generated from diesel fuel. While the Government of the Marshall Islands has established \nambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction and renewable energy targets based on its \nnationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement (implying a required 50% \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Honolulu: Graduate School USA Pacific Islands Training Initiative. \n ", "2 \nreduction in diesel consumption for power generation by 2025),4 achieving these targets will \nrequire an investment of at least $120 million.5 Funding for these investments has not been \nidentified. Responsible sector investment planning demands that existing plant and infrastructure, \nincluding the MTF, be maintained and preserved until they become obsolete and are replaced by \nalternative plants and technologies. \n \n6.  Urgency of tank farm rehabilitation. The MTF was commissioned in 1981 and appears \nto have been designed and soundly constructed in  compliance with applicable codes and \nstandards.  However,  its  current  condition  is  very  poor\u2014a  consequence  of  many  years  of \ninadequate  maintenance  in  a  harsh  and  corrosive  marine  environment  that  is  subject  to \natmospheric salt spray from all directions. All tanks and above-ground piping show significant \nsigns of corrosion. The concrete bunding also exhibits deterioration. Concrete flooring under tanks \nhas eroded significantly, exacerbating corrosion and causing stress on the steel tanks\u2019 welding \njoints. Critical safety and security features, such as ladders, bannisters, and basic lighting, have \nalso deteriorated or are entirely absent. \n \n7.  The MTF is a critical facility and the cornerstone of the Marshall Islands\u2019 energy security. \nIts dilapidated and rapidly deteriorating condition is a severe risk to the Marshall Islands economy, \nthe population\u2019s well-being, and the local environment. The risk of catastrophic failure of the tanks \nand  associated  infrastructure  (pumping  equipment,  piping,  and  containment  bunding)  is \nsignificant. Such failure will likely result in an acute and prolonged shortage of fuel for power \ngeneration,  a  significant  adverse  environmental  impact,  and  extraordinarily  high  costs  for \nremediation and interim alternative supply of fuel, as well as loss of revenue for MEC from fuel \nsales to commercial marine fleets. \n \n8.  Rehabilitation  of the  MTF  will  preserve the  Marshall  Islands\u2019  energy security,  while \nmitigating risks associated with potential catastrophic failure. MEC\u2019s fuel supply to commercial \nmaritime  transport  and  fishing  fleets  also  contributes  significantly  to  the  Marshall  Islands\u2019 \neconomy and is a revenue source for MEC that helps support its other operations (power \ngeneration and sales). \n \n9.  Value added by ADB assistance. Through technical assistance (TA), ADB is supporting \nMEC in its reforms to ensure its future as a viable and sustainable commercial public enterprise.6 \nThe rehabilitation of the MTF under the project will take place while the reform measures that this \nTA is preparing are being implemented. ADB is also implementing a grant to the Marshall Islands \nfor improving the power network distribution in Majuro,7 and considering a waste-to-energy project \nthat will contribute to the Marshall Islands\u2019 renewable energy targets and an additional network \nstrengthening investment project. Implementation of the reform measures that will be developed \nunder the TA will form part of the planned future investments. \n \n10.  Development coordination. The project will be implemented alongside investments and \ntechnical assistance supported by other development partners, including the World Bank, the \nEuropean Union, Japanese International Cooperation Agency, the Government of New Zealand, \n                                                \n4  In its NDCs, the Marshall Islands set a target of a 45% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions based on 2010 levels \nby 2030. \n5  Government of the Marshall Islands.

Alignment with development plans. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2019\u20132021 for the Marshall Islands8. It also supports the country\u2019s National Energy \nPolicy and Energy Action Plan9 and is aligned with the National Strategic Plan 2015-2017 (still \ncurrent), which prioritizes the rehabilitation of the MTF.10 The country operations business plan \nalso envisages further investments in MEC (para. 9). The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 (Table 1).11 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Project\u2019s Contributions \n1.

Notwithstanding that the MTF\u2019s dilapidated and deteriorating condition has been well-\ndocumented and understood by stakeholders for some time,12 no development-partner support \nhas been pledged to address the urgent investment needed to rehabilitate the MTF. Irrespective \nof the Marshall Islands\u2019 and development partners\u2019 prioritization of increased power generation \nfrom renewable sources (where the bulk of assistance resources have been directed in the past \nseveral years), the Marshall Islands will continue to rely on diesel as the cornerstone of its energy \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

The project is included under the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility (footnote \n1), which aims to improve regional energy security in the Pacific region. The facility was approved \nto cover supporting infrastructure, including required power sector infrastructure to maintain grid \noperation.  This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  transmission  and  distribution  assets,  diesel \ngeneration rehabilitation and upgrades, and rehabilitation of tank farm assets.14 The project \nqualifies to be approved under the Pacific Renewable Energy Financing Facility because (i) the \nproject\u2019s scope includes renewable energy generation and supporting energy sector infrastructure \n(para. 14), (ii) the Marshall Islands is one of the 11 eligible Pacific developing member countries, \n(iii) the project is identified in national energy sector planning documents as a priority investment \n(footnote 10), and (iv) the project has been classified category B for environment.  \n \n14.  Preservation of, and reinvestment in, MEC\u2019s and Kwajalein Atoll Joint Utilities Resources\u2019 \n(KAJUR) existing diesel generation assets will remain cost-effective and necessary under any \nrealistic scenario, even if RMI achieves its renewable energy targets: intermittent renewable \nenergy resources, irrespective of the extent of installation of capital-intensive battery storage and \nother enabling technologies, cannot cost-effectively form the basis of a reliable power grid in the \nMarshall Islands context.  This can only be provided  by diesel generation in this context.  \nIntermittent renewable generation technologies can cost-effectively only complement and partially \ndisplace diesel generation; they cannot replace it.  In fact, dispatch of any amount of intermittent \nrenewable power generation in RMI\u2019s power systems (MEC and KAJUR) is not feasible without \ndiesel generation forming the basis of the power systems to maintain system frequency. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) energy security for the Marshall Islands \nimproved and (ii) safety and environmental risks associated with handling and storage of refined \npetroleum products reduced.15 The project will have the following outcome: safe and reliable \noperation of the fuel tank farm  sustained and supply of fuel to power generation facilities \nthroughout the Marshall Islands continued.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output  1:  Majuro  tank  farm  rehabilitated.  The  project  will  fund  an  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contract for (i) the restoration of all fuel tank farm facilities to \nacceptable condition for sustained operation in compliance with applicable norms and standards \nfor safety, reliability, and environmental protection; and (ii) repair and enhancement of the seawall \nthat protects the MTF from erosion and storm surge (the MTF boundary is within 20 meters of the \nocean side of the atoll). \n \n17.  Output 2: Majuro tank farm operation and maintenance program instituted. The \nproject will develop adequate operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures and practices, \nincluding the identification of budgeting requirements, to ensure sustained operation of the \n                                                \n13 In its NDCs, the Republic of the Marshall Islands have set a target of a 45% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions \nbelow 2010 levels by 2030. \n14 Footnote 1, para. 31. \n15 Government of the Marshall Islands, Ministry of Resources and Development. 2016.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The rehabilitation of the fuel tank farm facility has been assessed as technically viable. \nThe MTF is the largest fuel storage in the Central Pacific. It is used to store fuel for electricity \ngeneration throughout the Marshall Islands, as well as for the supply of the international and \ndomestic fishing industry, international and domestic marine transport, and local road transport. \n \n24.  The fuel tank farm facility\u2019s rehabilitation is an urgent priority. Its dilapidated condition \npresents multiple risks. Catastrophic failure of its critical components could lead to the facility\u2019s \ninability to provide fuel handling and storage services. The health and welfare of personnel \nemployed in fuel handling and storage operations are in jeopardy because of the facility\u2019s poor \ncondition, lack of safety equipment, and poor operational practices. The risk of an adverse local \nenvironmental impact if critical component failure leads to large-volume spillage of diesel fuel or \nwaste oil currently stockpiled at the facility is also significant. \n \n25.  The fuel tank farm facility is adjacent to the ocean side (south side) of the Majuro lagoon, \nand is protected from erosion and inundation by a sloping rock seawall. The seawall has subsided \nin some places, and waves occasionally overtop the seawall and deposit debris in the facility. \nSince 1988, three recorded high-water events have inundated part of the site. While the bund \naround the fuel storage tanks has not been breached, inundation remains a real risk given the \n ", "7 \nanticipated  sea-level  rise  and  extreme  weather  event  intensification  from  climate  change. \nAccordingly, the project will include rehabilitation and enhancement of the rock seawall on the \nsouth side of the facility to mitigate against climate change-related risks. \n \n26.  The rehabilitation and upgrade of the MTF will include the replacement of tank assets and \nequipment that will be permanently exposed to the elements over their life cycle. The tank farm \nfacility technical due diligence for rehabilitation has been conducted following the American \nPetroleum  Institution  standard  653  (API  653),  which  provides  minimum  requirements  for \nmaintaining the integrity of such facilities after they have been placed in service; and addresses \ninspection, repair, alteration, relocation, and reconstruction. Works and goods packages under \nthe project will be based on this and other applicable standards. \n \n27.  The project will include advisory services for the development, implementation, and \nincorporation into MEC\u2019s routine business operations of appropriate arrangements and practices \nfor the O&M of the rehabilitated fuel tank farm facility. This will include training MEC personnel \nand allocating sufficient budget for continuous and adequate O&M program implementation. \n \n28.  The project will need to be implemented in stages to allow for uninterrupted operation of \nthe MTF facilities, hence the implementation period from 2019 through 2023. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  The project is found to be economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 16.9%, above the 9.0% minimum required EIRR for ADB investment projects, and \neconomic net present value of $10.8 million.  This is due mainly to the substantial benefits arising \nfrom the uninterrupted operation and extended economic life of the MTF, which would also \nfacilitate continued sale of fuel for power generation, as well as for maritime transport.  Economic \nviability is most sensitive to reductions in benefits, although sensitivity analyses confirm that the \nproject is expected to remain viable across a range of adverse scenarios. \n \n30.  The FIRR for the project is 4% and the FNPV, when discounted at the WACC of 1.8%, is \n$2.4  million.  This  demonstrates  that  the  project  is  financially  viable  to  its  owner,  MEC.  \nRefurbishment of the MTF would facilitate the uninterrupted sale of fuel, resulting in large annual \nrevenue streams. Financial viability likewise remains robust across adverse project scenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  ADB conducted a financial management assessment for the implementing agency, MEC. \nInherent financial management risk of the project before mitigation was assessed as substantial \nbecause  of  MEC\u2019s  entity-level  risks18.  MEC  has  delegated  the  selection  of  the  project \nimplementation consultants to ADB. Contractors and consultants will be paid directly by ADB. \n \n32.  To address threats to MEC\u2019s long-term viability, the MOF and MEC have agreed to \nimplement reform measures that are being prepared under ADB technical assistance (footnote \n6). These reform measures will be presented to MEC and the government in the second quarter \nof 2019.  In advance of this, the government has assented to four key assurances in the project \nlegal agreements:  \n \n                                                \n18 MEC Financial Management Assessment and Financial Analysis of MEC (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n(i)  within 1 year of grant effectiveness, the government has committed to transfer \nownership of the MTF to MEC; \n(ii)  within 15 months of grant effectiveness, the government has committed to a reform \nof  MEC\u2019s  corporate  governance  arrangements  such  that  they  conform  to \nOrganization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nCorporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (2015); \n(iii)  the government will provide for a tariff policy and rate structure that establishes \nMEC\u2019s authorized revenue based on verifiable, prudent and reasonable costs, \nwhile providing MEC an opportunity to recover its costs associated with providing \nelectricity service and incentivizing MEC to control and minimize its costs; and \n(iv)  the government will cause MEC to make available adequate budgetary resources \nfor the implementation of a suitable O&M program for the MTF (Output 2 of the \nproject). \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the MOF and MEC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual19. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The project will provide sustainability of critical economic infrastructure in the Marshall \nIslands that is at risk of catastrophic failure.  Such failure would have a severe negative impact \non the Marshall Islands economy, and on the population\u2019s well-being and societal welfare.  This \nproject is an urgent necessity to prevent such failure. \n \n35.  The project is classified no gender elements given the limited scope to ensure realistic \nand safe gender mainstreaming in the rehabilitation works. However, the project includes some \nproactive  gender  features  including  (i)  ensuring  women  are  involved  in  operation  and \nmaintenance training and (ii) ensuring the project management unit (PMU) conducts training as \nrequired to increase gender awareness among MEC staff and the contractors. ADB will provide \ntraining to the PMU and project staff on the principles outlined in the multilateral development \nbanks\u2019 joint statement on combatting sexual exploitation to ensure that the PMU and project staff \nare able to detect, intercept, respond to, and prevent (or refer) cases of sexual harassment, \ngender-based violence, and other problems that may emerge during project implementation. In \naddition, the project will indirectly support women through the continued provision of basic energy \nservices  that  provide  specific  benefits  to  women  including  increased  safety,  increased \nopportunities for women\u2019s economic empowerment, and time saved from sourcing alternative fuel \nsources. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \n37.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination was prepared following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project is expected to have only small, temporary, and \nlocalized adverse impacts on the environment, which can be readily managed by the proposed \n                                                \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nmitigation measures in the initial environmental examination and environmental management \nplan. The project management unit established in MEC will lead environmental supervision. \n \n38.  The project includes a comprehensive and detailed environmental management plan, \nwhose implementation will be incorporated into the goods and works packages and consulting \nservices for project implementation supervision support. The project will also institute adequate \nO&M procedures for the rehabilitated tank farm facility, including environmental monitoring and \nrisk-abatement measures. MEC personnel will be trained to implement these O&M procedures. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The due diligence \nreport confirmed that the project will not require any land acquisition, displace people, or have an \nimpact on any assets or livelihoods. No distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples will be \naffected. All activities in the overall project will be implemented in a culturally appropriate and \nparticipatory manner. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n   \n40.  The project faces six substantial risks.
