Limited housing supply adversely affects the \n3. \nliving  conditions  of  lower-income  households,  especially  in  large  cities  characterized  by  low \nbuilding standards. The shortage of housing units in India  is estimated at 18.7 million in urban \nareas  and  43.7  million in  rural  areas.3 More  than  90%  of  this  deficit  is  estimated  to  be  in  the \naffordable housing segment, primarily classified as EWS and LIG. A large number of urban lower-\nincome families, with a monthly household income of \u20b910,000\u2013\u20b925,000, can afford privately built \nhousing  costing  \u20b9400,000\u2013\u20b91  million.  This  customer  segment  needs  an  estimated  15  million \nhomes, which translates into a funding need of \u20b97 trillion.4 The Government of India launched the \nPradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana  (PMAY)  initiative  in  2015,  with  a  target  of  building  20  million \naffordable homes for the urban poor, including the EWS and LIG categories, by 2022.5 To date, \nabout 8.4 million homes have been authorized.6 Under the PMAY, the government offers interest \nrate  subsidies  of  3.0%\u20136.5%,  depending  on  the  loan  amount  and  the  income  category  of  the \nborrower, and other measures to incentivize the supply of affordable housing. \n \n4. \nFinance  sector  overview.  Banks  dominate  the  finance  sector,  with  the  assets  of \ncommercial banks totaling 75.0% of financial system assets.7 Public sector banks (PSBs) have \n65.8% of all banking assets, but are facing tighter capital constraints with an average leverage \n\n \n\n1  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Poverty  Alleviation  (MoHUA).  2017.  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojna  (PMAY).  The \nMoHUA\u2019s definition for EWS is family income of less than \u20b90.3 million per annum; family income of between \u20b90.3 \nmillion\u2013\u20b90.6 million per annum qualifies as an LIG; and the middle-income group has family income of above \u20b90.6 \nmillion and less than \u20b91.8 million per annum. For this report and recommendation of the President, lower-income \nhouseholds refer to EWS and LIGs. \n\n2  Lagging states have a higher poverty incidence or lower per capita income than the national average, or have special \nstatus as defined by the Government of India. Special Status is a classification given by the Government of India to \ncertain states that face geographical and socio-economic disadvantages such as hilly terrains, strategic international \nborders,  economic  and  infrastructural  backwardness,  and  non-viable  state  finances.  For  this  project,  the  lagging \nstates are Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, \nand West Bengal. \n\n3  M. Jena. 2016. U.N.

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (accessed on 28 July 2019). \n7  Reserve Bank of India. 2018. Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2017\u20132018. Mumbai. \n\n\fratio of 5.9%. Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) for the banking system declined to 9.3% in \nfiscal year (FY) 2019 from 11.5% in FY2018 and 9.6% in FY2017. The NPAs of private sector \nbanks (3.7%) and nonbank financial companies (NBFCs, 6.6%) reflected better performance than \nthat of PSBs (NPAs of 12.6%) in FY2019. NBFCs serve segments that typically are not catered \nto by banks. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had 9,659 NBFCs registered in FY2019. The NBFC \nsector has generally performed well; however, it has experienced tightening liquidity beginning in \nSeptember  2018  due  to  defaults  of  certain  high  profile  NBFCs,  including  housing  finance \ncompanies (HFCs).8 Despite the size of the banking industry, poor access to financial services \nremains  a  key  issue  in  India,  with  20.1%  of  people  unbanked.9 Access  to  credit  is  even  more \nlimited, with less than 7.0% of borrowers accessing credit via formal channels.10 \n \n5. \nHousing finance sector. Given borrowers\u2019 constrained access to credit and the limited \navailability of long-term funds for financial institutions offering home loans, mortgage penetration \nin  India  was  only  10.0% in  FY2018\u2014much  lower  than  in  other  emerging  markets  such  as  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (18.0%), Thailand (20.0%), and Malaysia (34.0%).11 Most commercial \nbanks  provide  mortgage  lending,  but  the  affordable  housing  segment  has  not  been  a  primary \ntarget as banks have concentrated on salaried employees in urban areas. HFCs are a significant \nplayer in mortgage financing, representing a 37.0% market share. Regulated by the RBI, the 77 \nHFCs  are  solely  mandated  to  fund  housing.12 The  volume  of  HFC  housing  loans  outstanding, \nincluding  loans  against  property  (LAPs),  totaled  \u20b920.9  trillion  in  December  2018,  up  by  an \nannualized rate of 15.6% since March 2018. With an NPA ratio of 1.1% (FY2018), the asset quality \nof HFCs exceeded that of banks. However, rural-focused HFCs targeting low-income segment \nhousehold incomes of less than \u20b90.2 million had an NPA ratio of 12.4% (FY2018) and those with \nincomes of \u20b90.2 million\u2013\u20b90.5 million had an NPA ratio of 4.7% (FY2018). The higher level of stress \nin  these  segments  is  likely  to  be  attributed  to  improper  assessment  of  borrower  debt  service \ncapacity and high loan\u2013value (LTV) ratios. \n \n6. \nloan  borrower  segments.  Lower-income  households  are \nparticularly constrained in obtaining mortgages because of the lack of documents to prove their \nincome source, high credit evaluation costs, and perceived higher credit risk. As a result, such \nhouseholds  typically  fund  their  homes  through  savings,  borrowings  from  family  and  friends,  or \nloans  from  local  moneylenders  at  usurious  interest  rates.  Women  in  this  income  group  find  it \nparticularly difficult to obtain mortgage loans to meet their housing needs, as men dominate land \nand home  ownership.  A survey  of  land  ownership  carried  out  by  ADB  in northern and eastern \nIndia indicated that women owned only 3.6% of plots, while men represented the vast majority \n(85.9%) and the remaining 10.5% were untitled.13 Lack of property ownership directly contributes \n\nUnderserved  home \n\n \n\n8   In September 2018, IL&FS, a large infrastructure development and finance conglomerate, defaulted on its payment \nobligations. The default was due to asset-liability maturity mismatches on the company\u2019s books which worsened due \nto delays in project execution. This led to a crunch in the supply of liquidity in the market which impacted the entire \nNBFC sector. Following a persistent liquidity crunch, Dewan Housing Finance Ltd. (DHFL), one of the largest housing \nfinance  companies,  also  defaulted  on  its  payments  in  June  2019.  DHFL  has  significant  exposure  to  real  estate \ndevelopers \u2013 a sector that is in the middle of a prolonged slowdown and was also heavily dependent on short-term \ndebt, both factors resulted in liquidity issues for the company. More recently, in September 2019, Altico, a NBFC \nfocused on real estate financing also defaulted on interest payments for bank loan due to liquidity shortfalls. \n\n9  The level of unbanked people in India declined from 65% in 2011 to 20% in 2017 after the government launched the \n\nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme, aiming to open 100 million bank accounts for poor families. \n\n10 World Bank. Financial Inclusion Data/Global Findex: India (accessed 9 September 2019). According to the World \nBank\u2019s Findex report (2018), only 8% of males and 5% of females over the age of 15 are reported to have borrowed \nfrom a financial institution. \n\n11 Housing Finance Information Network.

Manila: ADB. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nto  the  low  social  status  of  women,  vulnerability  to  poverty  and  low  bargaining  power  within \nhouseholds. 14 Recognizing  the  issues  related  to  low  levels  of  women\u2019s  property  ownership, \nseveral  states  in India  have  provided tax  incentives  for  women  holding  property  titles.  Female \naccess  to  finance  in  India  is  also  extremely  low,  with  only  5.0%  of  women  reported  to  have \nborrowed from a formal financial institution and only 3.0% having an outstanding housing loan.15 \n \n7. \nRationale.  To  address  the  need  to  improve  affordable  housing  finance,  particularly  for \nwomen and lower-income households, ADB identified HFC partners that have demonstrated the \nability to reach such households on a sustainable basis. While ADB has provided funding to HFCs \nin India in the past,16 the proposed project targets lower-income EWS and LIG segments (footnote \n1) than the previous loans and focuses entirely on female borrowers. Aavas, an HFC based in \nRajasthan, targets the lower-income EWS and LIG segments in rural and small towns classified \nas  Tier  II  and  below.17 Some  83%  of  Aavas  loans  are  to  lower-income  households,18 65%  of \nclients  are  self-employed,  and  44.4%  are first-time  borrowers from  formal  financial  institutions. \nWith  women  representing  58.8%  of  primary  borrowers  and  nearly  all  remaining  loans  having \nwomen  as  co-borrowers,  Aavas  has  a  very  strong  footprint  in  servicing  women.  Aavas  has \ndemonstrated successful business growth, led by experienced senior managers and supported \nby strong middle management. Its robust risk management entails a strong presence of credit \nofficers at its branches. Aavas proved the strength of its prudent operations and risk management \nfollowing demonetization in November 2016, where it was able to maintain strong asset quality, \nsignificantly better than most of its peers. Using technology and automated processes enables \nAavas to have efficient and cost-effective loan sourcing, approval, and monitoring as it scales its \nbusiness across 10 states and seeks to empower more women property owners. The proposed \nproject will support the growth of Aavas from its strong presence in western India toward more \nchallenging, less serviced regions.  \n \nB. \n \nOverview. Aavas was incorporated as Au Housing Finance Private Limited (Au Housing) \n8. \nin February 2011 and began operations in March 2012. It started as a fully owned subsidiary of \nAu Financiers, an NBFC that converted to a small finance bank (SFB) in 2017.19 Associated with \nits  licensing  as  an  SFB,  Au  Financiers  sold  Au  Housing  to  private  equity  investors  Kedaara \nCapital, Partners Group ESCL, and Partners Group Private Equity (Master Fund), LLC in 2016. \nIn March 2017, the company name was changed to Aavas Financiers Limited.  \n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\n14 International Center for Research on Women. 2008.

Most of \n9. \nAavas\u2019 business (about 89.5%) has focused on the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, \nand Madhya Pradesh, with Rajasthan contributing 44.0% of its assets under management (AUM) \nas at the end of FY2019. The company mainly offers housing loans (78.6%), while 21.4% of loans \nwere LAPs to fund businesses and top-up loans for personal use. The average loan size is \u20b90.86 \nmillion, and more than 90.0% of its loans totaled less than \u20b91.5 million ($21,067) in FY2019, while \n83.0% of the loans represented lower-income households. The average contractual tenor of loans \nis 15 years, but the weighted average life of the loan is 7.5 years because of prepayments.  \n \n10. \nBusiness  strategy.  Since  its  foundation,  Aavas  has  become  the  largest  HFC  in  the \naffordable housing segment holding \u20b959.4 billion in AUM (FY2019) with a market share of 6.8%.21 \nAavas will continue to focus on non-salaried lower income customers, penetrating deeper into the \n10 states with existing operations, especially in districts with low mortgage penetration. From its \nbase  in  Rajasthan,  Aavas  has  gradually  expanded  into  the  adjacent  states  of  Gujarat, \nMaharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand. \nThe company will continue to focus on home loans and self-construction home loans, with a cap \nof 25.0% on loans for non-housing purposes. \n \nC. \n \nOwnership.  As  of  31  March  2019,  Aavas\u2019  promoters  included  private  equity  investors \n11. \nLake District (34.3%), Partners Group ESCL (16.7%), and Partners Group Private Equity (Master \nFund),  LLC. (7.3%).  AU Small  Finance  Bank  held 7.2%,  while  other  institutional  investors,  the \npublic, and employees held the remaining 34.5%. Integrity due diligence was conducted.22 Some \n41.7% of shares are with non-promoter and no single investor holds more than 10.0%. While the \nshares held by the three private equity funds are not permitted to disclose details of their investors, \nADB has received written confirmation that anti-money laundering and combating the financing \nof terrorism checks have been conducted in compliance with relevant statutory requirements.23 \nTwo members of the board of directors are politically exposed persons, having served as directors \nin state-owned entities, but they do not appear to be subjects of any adverse media. ADB\u2019s review \nof the relevant entities does not give cause to believe they were established or are being used for \ncross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing.  \n  \n12. \nGovernance  structure.  Aavas\u2019  board  has  nine  members,  including  three  independent \ndirectors,  five  nominee  directors,  and  the  chief  executive  officer.  The  chair  of  the  board  is  an \nindependent director. The board members have experience across the financial services sector, \nincluding with large PSBs, private equity firms, and commercial banks. The audit committee has \na majority of independent directors and the nomination and remuneration committees have equal \nnumber of independent and non-executive nominee directors. Aavas\u2019 statutory auditor is S. R. \nBatliboi & Associates, an EY associate.

Atre worked at Equitas Housing Finance, ICICI Bank and \nCholamandalam before joining Aavas.  \n \n14. \nRisk management. Aavas\u2019 risk management framework and limits are set by its board of \ndirectors,  supported  by  risk  management,  audit,  and  asset  liability  management  (ALM) \ncommittees. The committees are mandated to supervise and identify current and emerging risks, \ndevelop  risk  assessment  systems,  monitor  control  mechanisms,  and  monitor  defined  risk \ntolerance limits. \n \nCredit  risk.  Aavas  has  a  standardized  credit  approval  process  that  entails  customer \n15. \nselection  criteria,  credit  risk,  and  cash  flow  analysis  for  quality  customers.  The  most  heavily \nweighted factors in the credit process include cash flow analysis based on the employment profile \nof the borrower; the Bureau  score; the quality of the property mortgaged; the loan amount; and \nthe  LTV  ratio. 24  Credit  exposures,  limits,  and  asset  quality  are  regularly  monitored  by  the \nmanagement.  Almost  all  loans  fund  owner-occupied  dwellings;  Aavas  does  not  fund  builders. \nCredit  review  is  segregated  from  the  sales  operations  and  the  ratio  of  risk  to  sales  officers  is \nstrong at 1.0:2.5. \n \n16. \nPortfolio monitoring and collections. The company maintains a comprehensive system \nof  internal  controls,  with  key  backup  procedures  and  continuity  plans.  The  internal  audit  team \nensures  compliance  with  controls  and  processes.  Aavas  also  studies  the  behavior  of  declined \ncustomers to enhance its loan approval process. The credit team receives daily updates on any \noverdue payments for all loans underwritten within 18 months. Aavas uses predictive analytics to \nidentify probable late payment cases in advance and to trigger prompt action by its collections \nteam.  \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n17. \nThe  ADB  assistance  consists  of  a  senior  secured  debt  facility  of  up  to  $60  million \nequivalent in Indian rupees with a tenor of up to 8 years. The ADB financing will be in the form of \nnonconvertible debentures with an exclusive legal charge on the security provided. 25 ADB may \nenter into risk transfers with eligible counterparties for a portion of the exposure. \n \nB. \n \n18. \nUse of proceeds. Aavas will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s facility to provide housing finance \nto  EWS,  LIG  and  MIG  households.  The  entire  ADB  loan  amount  will  be  onlent  to  women  as \nprimary borrowers or as co-borrowers. At least 75% of the loan proceeds will be used in selected \nlagging states.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n24 TransUnion  CIBIL  Limited  is  a  credit  information  bureau  operating  in  India.  The  bureau  maintains  credit  files  on \nindividuals and businesses and provides scores that can be used to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower. \n25 A nonconvertible debenture is a debt security with a fixed rate of interest and specified tenor, which is not convertible \nto  equity.  The  security  includes  eligible  receivables,  which  meet  the  following  criteria:  (i)  in  the  \u201cstandard\u201d  or \nequivalent category under the borrower\u2019s asset classification system and (ii) that have not been restructured. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nReporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration.26 Aavas \n19. \nwill report to ADB on regular intervals with (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual \naudited  financial  statements,  (iii)  quarterly  loan  portfolio  and  covenant  reports,  (iv)  annual \ndevelopment indicators agreed between ADB and Aavas, (v) annual reports on safeguards and \nsocial protection compliance, and (vi) annual progress report on the implementation of the gender \naction plan (GAP). \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nC. \n \n20. \nAccess to housing for underserved segments and women. India\u2019s mortgage markets \nare still underdeveloped and lower-income segments lack access to mortgage finance. Housing \nis also a strong contributor to employment. According to an ADB study, \u20b910 million invested in \nconstruction creates 22,000 unskilled, 23,000 skilled and semi-skilled, and 9,000 managerial and \ntechnical  person  work-days  in  India. 27  As  up  to  40%  of  Indian  homes  in  urban  areas  are \nnonpermanent, this transaction targets extending access to affordable permanent quality housing \nto lower-income segments, representing an inclusive business model. As a result of the project, \nthe  market for  housing  loans and  improved  houses  will  be  also  extended towards  women  and \npeople in lagging states. \n \n21. \nAccess to longer-tenor local currency debt. Aavas has an ongoing need for long-term \ndebt  financing  to  respond  to  the  demand  for  affordable  mortgages  targeting  low-income \nhouseholds. Aavas\u2019 assets have a legal maturity of 15 years at origination and 7.5 years (after \nprepayment),  requiring  long-tenor  debt  financing  to  ensure  a  prudent  ALM.  NBFCs  and  HFCs \nmust  also  diversify  funding  to  maintain  adequate  liquidity,  particularly  given  the  current  tight \nliquidity conditions.  \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact.

According  to  ADB\u2019s  India  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue to support the finance sector.29 \nThe project will also support access to affordable housing in lagging states, in line with the PMAY \ninitiative. The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment \nOperational Plan, 2013\u20132020.30 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).The  loan\u2019s  potential  environmental  and  social  (E&S)  impacts,  the  risks \nassociated  with  the  borrower\u2019s  existing  and/or  likely  future  portfolio,  and  its  commitment  and \ncapacity for E&S management have been assessed by ADB. \n \n27. \nCategory  FI  (treated  as  C).  Aavas\u2019  business  activities  have  minimal  or  no  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples.  Aavas  will  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list;  (ii)  exclude \nactivities  with  category  A  and  B  environment  and  social  safeguard  impacts;  (iii)  ensure  that \ninvestments  using  ADB  funds  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  abide  by \napplicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy; and (iv) take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards. \nAavas  will  confirm  this  in  its  periodic  report  to  ADB  and  need  not  apply  any  other  specific \nsafeguard or social requirements. ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) as FI treated as C for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples, and need not apply any other specific requirements. \n \n28. \nEnvironmental and social safeguards. Aavas will not finance real estate development \nor  mass  housing  construction,  and targets  lower-income  and  women  home  borrowers.  Aavas\u2019 \ncurrent  portfolio  generally  falls  within  the  environment  category  C  classification,  wherein  the \nexisting loans or subloans are likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. The \nclimate change impact from the project is expected to be low because of the nature and scale of \nloans that may be financed by the ADB loan proceeds. No land acquisition, physical or economic \ndisplacement,  or  impact  on  indigenous  peoples\u2019  communities  are  expected  since  the  housing \nloans will be provided to individuals who have purchased the property or are voluntarily making \nimprovements to their dwellings. Aavas\u2019 credit policy also excludes activities that impinge on lands \nowned or claimed under adjudication by indigenous peoples, or without the full consent of such \npeople. \n \n29. \nAavas has an established E&S policy. The chief risk officer is responsible for E&S matters, \nwhile the company secretary receives and responds to complaints from the public or civil society \norganizations.  Engineers  conduct  site  visits  and  prepare  valuation  reports  describing  the \nconditions  in  which  the  property  is  situated  and the  market  value,  based  on  prevailing  market \nrates.  Aavas  has  adopted  the  exclusion  list  of  the  International  Finance  Corporation.  Internal \ntrainings on E&S are being provided by Aavas to all relevant staff, and compliance with E&S is \nalso reported in the annual monitoring report as part of its requirements to the CDC Group plc. \n\n \n\n29 ADB.  2017.

Embedded in its \n30. \nrecruitment  policy  is  the  principle  that  Aavas  does  not  discriminate  based  on  gender,  region, \nreligion,  caste,  or  creed.  To  secure  its  employees\u2019  well-being,  Aavas  has  adopted  (i)  a  human \nresources  policy  outlining  benefits,  including  maternity  benefits  and  flexible  work  hours;  (ii)  a \nVishakha Policy (Policy Against Sexual Harassment) to prevent and deter sexual harassment at \nwork; (iii) an employee grievance redressal policy that ensures all communication channels are \nopen for employee grievances; and (iv) a whistleblower policy to encourage employees to report \nconcerns regarding unethical behavior or fraud. Aavas will (i) apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities list; (ii) exclude all projects that have adverse E&S social safeguard impacts (categories \nA and B); (iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations;  and  (iv)  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (footnote  31).  Aavas  will \nconfirm these in its periodic reports to ADB. \n \n31. \nAavas  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.31 Aavas will report on its compliance with such laws.
