The successful implementation of ADB\u2019s municipal infrastructure projects funded by local \ncurrency  bonds2 generated  considerable  interest  among  private  sector  sponsors  and  financial \ninstitutions, as lack of access to finance has been a bottleneck for private participation in urban \nenvironmental infrastructure. It was discovered that CWA is a private sector front runner with a \npioneering  business  model  and  strong  execution  ability.  Through  due  diligence,  ADB \ndetermined that the proposed project supports ADB\u2019s strategies for environmental sustainability, \ninclusive growth, and financial and technical feasibility. In addition to facilitating investments by \nCWA,  ADB's  assistance  is  expected  to  bring  significant  developmental  benefits,  including \nsupporting  private  sector  participation  in  the  newly  opened  water  distribution  subsector, \ncatalyzing  local  and  international  commercial  financing,  and  supporting  the  government's \nobjective of improving the urban environment in the country.   \n \nB. \n\nSector Background  \n\n \n\n1. \n\nThe Urban Water Sector in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n3. \nSuccessful  economic  reforms  and  significant  growth  of  the  PRC  economy  have \naccelerated urbanization. The country\u2019s urban population has more than tripled from 190 million \nin 1980 to 607 million in 2008, accounting for 45.7% of the national population; it is expected to \naccount  for  55.0%  of  the  total  by  2020,  an  incremental  increase  of  about  200  million  people. \nThis  demographic  shift  has  continuously  increased  the  need  for  water  access  and  reliability. \nAlthough  more  than  90%  of  the  urban  population  has  access  to  piped  water,  capacity  to  fulfill \n\u201clast mile\u201d connections to newly urbanizing areas is critically short.  \n \n4. \nWhen the economy was centrally planned, the provision of water was considered a basic \nsocial right and was heavily subsidized by the government. Water supply companies owned by \nlocal governments owned charged limited fees for the consumption of resources and provision \nof services. This system led to a scarcity of capital for the construction, renovation, operation, \nand maintenance of water infrastructure. The lack of expansion and maintenance of pipelines, \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\ncombined  with  growing  demand  for  water,  has  resulted  in  widespread  water  inefficiency\u2014\nreflected  in  incomplete  metering,  unreliable  service,  pipeline  leaks,  and  health  safety  issues \nfrom water that is below national quality standards. \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy and Regulatory Framework \n\nThe  government\u2019s  water  policy  aims  to  (i)  develop  water  sources;  (ii)  protect  existing \n5. \nsources  by  controlling \nintroduce  water-efficient \nindustrial  and  residential  pollution;  (iii) \ntechnologies and operations; and (iv) implement appropriate pricing mechanisms to encourage \nconservation  and  generate  necessary  funds  for  operation,  maintenance,  and  investment.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  economic  and  enterprise  reform  programs  require  that  all  water  supply  and \nwastewater projects be financially sustainable and capable of recovering costs. \n \n 6. \nOversight of the urban water sector is coordinated by the central government, which sets \npolicies,  standards,  and  guidelines  for  drinking  water  quality;  wastewater  discharge;  and  the \nplanning  and  construction  of  water,  wastewater,  and  drainage  infrastructure. 3  Provincial \nagencies set implementing regulations; approve selected actions of municipal agencies such as \ntariff adjustments, and large investment projects; and oversee compliance with water supply and \nwastewater  standards.  Municipal  governments  are  responsible  for  providing  water  and \nwastewater services, typically through a municipally owned company, and setting tariffs.  \n \n7. \nPolicies  to  commercialize  the  municipal  water  supply  sector  began  in  1998  with  a \nnational policy mandating that urban water utilities earn a return on equity and introducing clear \ntariff-setting  procedures.4 Subsequent  directives  sought  to  commercialize  the  sector  further:  (i) \nthe  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  recommended  setting  water  tariffs  according  to  supply \nand  demand,  and  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  emphasized  improvements  in  water \nintensity  (i.e.,  reducing  the  amount  of  water  used  per  unit  of  economic  output);  (ii)  the  Water  \nLaw was revised in 2002 to allow customers to be charged for the volume of water consumed; \n(iii)  five  ministry-level  bodies,  including  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \n(NDRC),  in  2002  jointly  issued  a  nationwide  framework  for  urban  water  tariff  determination, \nincluding  formalizing  the  requirement  that  operation,  maintenance,  and  debt  service  costs  be \nrecovered through tariffs and other user fees;5 and (iv) various agencies have instituted a series \nof complementary policies, such as the \u201cone meter per household\u201d policy to reduce nonrevenue \nwater6 and improve  water quality. In 2009, the NDRC and  the Ministry of Housing and Urban-\nRural  Development  (MOHURD)  announced  priorities  for  urban  water  distribution  tariffs: 7  (i) \nraising  tariffs  gradually  to  encourage  conservation  and  efficiency,  (ii)  increasing  transparency, \n\n                                                 \n3   Several  ministries  carry  out  these  functions:  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  oversees  water  resource \nallocation  as  well  as  usage  in  rural  areas  (irrigation  and  residential);  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban-Rural \nDevelopment  (MOHURD,  formerly  the  Ministry  of  Construction)  regulates  engineering  and  urban  water  use;  the \nMinistry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP)  regulates  pollution  and  wastewater  treatment;  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) oversees tariff policy; while the Ministry of Health issues standards \nfor the quality of residential tap water. \n\n4   NDRC  and  MOHURD.  1998.  Administrative  Measures  on  Tariffs  for  Town  Water  Supply.  Beijing.  (23  September \n1998, amended 29 November 2004). The measures provide benchmarks for an average rate of return on equity for \nmunicipal  water  utilities,  i.e.,  from  8%\u201312%  for  utilities  with  private  investment  and  not  exceeding  6%  for \ngovernment-owned utilities.  \n\n5   NDRC,  Ministry  of  Finance,  MOHURD,  MWR,  and  MEP.  2002.

Beijing.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n(iii)  setting  block  tariffs  (progressive  by  volume)  to  encourage  conservation,  (iv)  establishing \nsimple  sector  categories  for  tariffs,  (v)  incorporating  pro-poor  affordability  measures,  and  (vi) \nraising  public  awareness  of  water  issues.  In  its  first  policy  circular  of  2011,  the  State  Council \nemphasized  the  need  to  \u201caccelerate  reform  and  development\u201d  of  the  water  supply  sector, \nincluding the reform of tariffs.8 The 12th Five Year Plan (2011\u20132015) announced in March 2011 \nfurther emphasizes water efficiency, with a 30% cut in water intensity targeted by 2015.   \n \n8. \nAccording  to  the  national  tariff  guidelines,  water  distribution  tariffs  are  to  be  set  on  a \ncost-plus  basis,  including  the  costs  of  treated  water,  costs  of  distribution,  specified  rates  of \nreturn,  and  taxes.9 In  practice,  municipalities  are  raising  tariffs  at  varying  paces  to  reach  the \nmandated  levels  of  cost  recovery  and  returns.  The  average  residential  tariff  in  the  PRC\u2019s  35 \nlargest cities at the end of 2008 was CNY2.4 per cubic meter, including CNY0.7 per cubic meter \nfor wastewater treatment charges. By international standards, this tariff level is low: household \nwater expenses in these 35 cities account for about 1% of total family disposable income, below \nthe  global  average  of  2%\u20135%.  ADB  has  recommended  that  water  tariffs  be  increased  to  help \npromote  conservation  and  to  make  water  utilities  financially  sustainable,  and  has  encouraged \nmunicipal water authorities to \u201censure the water tariff adjustment process is carried out smoothly \nand on-time.\u201d10 \n \n9. \nQuality  standards  are  increasing.  For  drinking  water,  new  standards,  which  were \nintroduced  in  2006  in  line  with  World  Health  Organization  requirements  and  best  practices  in \ndeveloped  countries,  have  increased  the  number  and  stringency  of  indicators  tested.11 Higher \nstandards  increase  the  investment  requirements  for  treatment,  delivery,  and  monitoring  and \ntesting systems. Moreover, the government has identified urban and rural water quality as a key \ndevelopment task for the 12th Five Year Plan.   \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n10.  While PRC water treatment and wastewater treatment projects have been undertaken by \na  wide  range  of  private  sector  developers  since  the  late  1990s,  private  sector  investment  in \nthese  areas  has  been  largely  based  on  the  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  model.  Building  on \npolicies  to  commercialize  municipal water  distribution  and  treatment  (para.  7),  the  government \nhas encouraged private sector participation in the municipal water supply sector. In 2004, water \ndistribution  in  medium-sized  and  small  cities  was  opened  to  joint  ventures  involving  foreign \ninvestors.  Further,  a  standard  concession  agreement  template  was  promulgated  to  facilitate \nprivate sector participation.12 In 2005 and annually during 2007\u20132010, the State Council issued \npolicies  encouraging  the  investment,  construction,  and  operation  of  water  distribution  and \ntreatment by private entities, and mandating municipalities to allow such participation.13  \n\n                                                 \n8  State Council. 2011.

(23 September     \n1998, amended 29 November 2004). Under these measures, the cost of treated water refers to the raw water tariff  \nand  any  other  direct  expenses  from  the  process  of  water  treatment  (including  electricity;  chemicals  and  other          \nmaterials; depreciation; maintenance and repair; labor; and quality inspecting, monitoring, and testing). The cost of \ndistribution  includes  sales,  management,  and  financial  costs.  Water  lost  during  distribution  is  considered  a  cost.   \nReturns are to be set according to whether the utility is private-invested or government-owned (see footnote 4). \n10  ADB. 2009.

Several  Opinions  on  Encouraging,  Supporting,  and  Guiding  the \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\n \n11. \nNonetheless,  in  water  distribution  private  participation  has  remained  limited,  often \ninvolving  only  minority  investments  in  municipal  utilities.  Utilities  owned  by  municipal \ngovernments  still  own  and  operate  more  than  90%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  municipal  water  distribution \nnetworks.  Given  the  substantial  level  of  investment  required  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  water \npipeline networks and the limited self-financing capacity of municipal-owned utilities, increased \nprivate  ownership  and  operation  of  water  distribution  are  expected  to  improve  operational \nefficiency and help achieve the government\u2019s water efficiency and quality goals.  \n \n12. \nFinancing  has  constrained  the  ability  of  private  sector  developers  to  scale  up  their \noperations.  In  studies  of  the  PRC  municipal  water  sector,  the  World  Bank  has  concluded  that \nfinancing  remains  one  of  the  critical  barriers  to  better  sector  performance. 14  Local  banks \ntypically prefer to lend to large state-owned firms, and are averse to lending to newly privatized \ncompanies. Private companies also have difficulty tapping the enterprise bond market, as bond \nissuance in the PRC is time-consuming, complicated, and subject to numerous approvals.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  Strategy  2020,  which  emphasizes  support  for  achieving \n13. \npoverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  through  environmentally  sustainable  development  and \nprivate sector development.15 The strategy identifies infrastructure and the environment as two \nof  the  five  core  areas  in  which  ADB  will  employ  its  financial  and  institutional  resources  to \nmaximize  results,  efficiency,  and  impact.  In  terms  of  infrastructure,  the  project  is  in  line  with \nStrategy 2020\u2019s emphasis on public\u2013private partnerships and private sector engagement. ADB \nwill  also  seek  to  improve  human  health  through  interventions  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  and \nwaste  management.  With  regard  to  the  environment,  ADB  will  assist  developing  member \ncountries  and  their  municipalities  in  addressing  a  range  of  problems  resulting  from  rapid \nurbanization. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n14. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  is  based  on  four  development  pillars: \n(i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.16 The project reinforces each of these pillars, with particular support \nfor pillars (ii) and (iv). It will be integral to ADB\u2019s efforts to help improve urban environment in the \nPRC.  \n \nThe  PRC  has  been  steadily  turning  to  development  that  is  market-oriented  and  led  by \n15. \nthe  private  sector,  which  has  become  the  driving  force  for  economic  growth  and  job  creation. \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure, energy, finance, and \nenvironmental improvement, and build on ADB\u2019s public sector policy advice to the government \non  private  sector  development.  For  infrastructure,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nDevelopment of Individual and Private Economy and Other Non-Public Sectors of the Economy.

As  agreed  with  the \ngovernment, ADB\u2019s private sector operations focus on viable projects located in less-developed \nregions  and  explore  the  possibility  of  loans  funded  by  ADB\u2019s  yuan-denominated  bonds.  As  a \nfinancially strong project focused mainly on a sector newly opened to private sector participation \nand with the option to be partly funded through a yuan loan, the project is consistent with these \naims.  \n \nThe  project  will  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  in  the  PRC  and  will \n16. \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  overall  support  for  urban  development  in  the  PRC  through  investment \nprojects  and  knowledge  products.  In  particular,  the  project  benefits  from  public  sector \noperations\u2019 policy advice and lessons learned from public sector water supply projects.17  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Water Policy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy, 18  which  emphasizes  careful \n17. \nmanagement  and  participatory  approaches  to  conserve  water.  In  response  to  the  huge  unmet \nwater  needs  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  consistent  with  the  recommendations  of  various \ninternational initiatives to double water investments, ADB has made water a core business area \nand envisages doubling its water investments to more than $2 billion annually.19 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n18. \nThe  project  will  expand  and  improve  water  distribution  coverage,  develop  related \ntransmission and treatment infrastructure, and increase the quality and reliability of water supply \nto cities through private sector participation.  \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Sponsor and the Borrowers \n\nThe  project  will  have  two  borrowers:  CWA  for  the  US  dollar  tranche  and  for  the  yuan \n\n19. \ntranche, CIL, a holding company for CWA\u2019s urban water supply operations in the PRC. \n \n20. \nCWA,  the  sponsor  and  the  borrower  representative  for  the  ADB  loan,  is  a  private \ncompany listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. CWA specializes in urban water operations \nin  the  PRC.  Following  the  government\u2019s  policy  to  encourage  private  sector  investment  in  the \nurban water sector, CWA was founded by a team of senior managers with strong water supply \nexperience  in  the  PRC  and  a  good  reputation.  CWA  has  grown  rapidly  to  establish  itself  as  a \npioneering private sector company in the PRC water supply industry.. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  2007.

Asia Water Watch 2015. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\nCWA\u2019s core value is optimizing water for cities. In 2003, CWA launched its operations as \n21. \none of the first private companies to own and operate water distribution networks in the PRC. \nAbout 85% of CWA\u2019s revenues are from water treatment and distribution, although the company \nalso  operates  wastewater  treatment  plants  in  locations  where  the  local  governments  request \nCWA  to  expand  beyond  municipal  water  supply.  At  the  end  of  2010,  the  company  operated \nmunicipal  water  supply  utilities  under  concessions  or  similar  arrangements  in  23  cities,  with  a \ntotal distribution capacity of 4.1 mcm per day and wastewater treatment capacity of 0.2 mcm per \nday.20 CWA employs more than 4,500 people in the PRC. \n \n22. \nCWA\u2019s  strategy  is  to  acquire  underperforming  water  supply  utilities  from  municipalities \nand improve their operational and financial performance. Many PRC distribution utilities owned \nby  municipal  governments  are  inefficient  and  undercapitalized,  often  leading  to  incomplete \nmetering,  low  returns,  and  gradual  infrastructure  degradation.  CWA  expands  coverage  of  its \nsubprojects  to  link  neighboring  networks  and  connect  new  economic  development  zones. \nThrough technical improvements, CWA can reduce nonrevenue water and turn around a utility\u2019s \nperformance.21 CWA  replaces  outdated  pipes  and  reconfigures  network  layouts;  adds  pump \nstations  to  control  pressure  throughout  the  network;  and  locates  pipeline  leaks  with  centrally \ncontrolled pressure and flow monitors and acoustic detection equipment. By rehabilitating older \npipeline systems, CWA also reduces secondary pollution caused by pipeline corrosion or other \ncontamination. CWA installs meters at each end user and introduces billing systems to facilitate \npayment  (e.g.,  bank  debit,  prepaid  cards,  and  cash  at  CWA  service  counters)  and  service \nimprovements  (e.g.,  24-hour  hotlines  and  rapid-response  repair  teams).  Through  these \ninvestments,  end  users  benefit  from  increased  water  availability,  stable  pressure,  water  at \nquality standards, and improved customer care. \n \n23. \nCWA  can  further  improve  operations  of  subprojects  through  the  introduction  of \ncommercial  management  systems.  Standard  measures  introduced  at  newly  privatized  utilities \ninclude  (i)  seconding  senior  management  in  the  initial  stage  after  acquisition;  (ii)  setting \ncompany performance targets; (iii) creating key performance indicators (KPIs) for all staff;22 (iv) \nlinking  KPIs  to  bonuses  and  promotions;  (v)  training  managerial  and  technical  staff;  and  (vi) \nsharing knowledge between the acquired utility and other subproject companies through senior \nmanager rotations, company-wide  meetings to share experiences and best practices, and use \nof shared technical experts based at regional hubs. CWA also maintains a system of operational \nand financial reporting and benchmarking on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n24. \nCWA  will  use  the  ADB  assistance  to  fund  a  series  of  water  treatment  and  distribution \nsubprojects with total capacity of up to 2 mcm per day by FY2015. The project is designed to be \na  least-cost  solution  to  financing  medium-sized  water  supply  projects,  the  financing  of  which \ninvolves  relatively  high  transaction  costs.  ADB  and  CWA  aim  to  finance  the  water  supply \ninfrastructure  projects  on  a  portfolio  basis  to  reduce  financing  transaction  costs  and  diversify \nrisk.  This  portfolio  approach,  broad  in  reach,  will  enable  ADB  to  provide  financing  support  for \n\n                                                 \n20 CWA holds a 1.6% share of PRC tap water capacity and 0.5% share of wastewater treatment capacity. \n21 CWA\u2019s  success  in  reducing  nonrevenue  water  depends  on  site-specific  factors.  Sites  examined  in  due  diligence \n\nrecorded 3%\u20134% point average annual reductions in nonrevenue water during 2008\u20132010. \n\n22 CWA\u2019s KPIs at the utility level include improvement in the nonrevenue rate; improvement in the fee collection rate; \nincreases in operating efficiency (e.g., per-unit consumption of electricity, chemicals, or other inputs); reductions in \noperating  costs;  improvement  in  the  compliance  rate  with  water  quality  standards;  and  avoidance  of  operational \nfailures or safety incidents.  These utility KPIs are mapped to individual-level performance targets for all staff. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nmultiple  water  supply  projects  that  are  often  too  small  and  time-consuming  for  ADB  or \ninternational banks to finance on a stand-alone basis.  \n \n25.  Major investments at each subproject will be completed in the following five critical areas \nas soon as practical upon CWA\u2019s takeover: (i) repairing or replacing old pipelines and upgrading \nwater treatment plants; (ii) optimizing network connections by introducing pumping stations and \nchanging  the  diameter  of  pipes;  (iii)  centralizing  management  and  dispatching  systems,  which \ninvolves a new information technology system, a network operation system, remote supervision \nof  the  network,  and  automation  of  pumping  stations;  (iv)  expanding  and  densifying  water \ndistribution networks; and (v) expanding the water treatment plants after the network coverage \nreaches a critical mass.  \n  \nTo  achieve  long-term  environmentally  sustainable  growth  and  to  set  standards  in  the \n26. \nfast-growing  water  supply  industry,  the  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  incorporate  loan \nconditions,  such  as  the  maintenance  of  a  transparent  corporate  governance  structure  and  the \nadoption  and  maintenance  of  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS) \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). These components of the project are \nexpected  to  serve  as  best-practice  examples  to  CWA\u2019s  peers  in  the  industry,  enhancing  its \ndemonstration effects.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe  project  output  is  the  efficient  operation  at  designed  performance  levels  of  up  to  2 \nmcm  per  day  of  water  supply  facilities  that  comply  with  ADB  safeguards  and  technical  and \nfinancial eligibility criteria. The project's expected outcome is improved water supply services in \nsecond- and third-tier cities.  \n \nB. \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n28. \nThe  project  directly  contributes  to  basic  human  needs  by  expanding  access  to  clean \nwater and by mitigating secondary pollution during distribution of water to urban households and \nindustries  in  second-  and  third-tier  cities  in  the  PRC.  Poor  people  are  most  vulnerable  to \nenvironment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical attention \nfor digestive tract ailments associated with drinking polluted water.  \n \n29. \nThe  project  will  improve  water  efficiency  by  supporting  private  sector  participation  in \nwater distribution to increase service quality and coverage, reduce costs, and improve financial \nviability. Reducing inefficiencies in water distribution and improving the supply of clean drinking \nwater  is  a  component  of  pro-poor  development. 23  The  project  will  also  contribute  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  long-term  plans  to  reduce  the  national  nonrevenue  water  ratio  to  12%.  Lower \nrates  of  nonrevenue  water  are  typically  associated  with  improved  tap  water  access  for  poorer \nurban households.24  \n \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2010.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n30. \nThe project supports the government\u2019s strategy to encourage private sector participation \nin  urban  water  supply  services  which  are  provided  mainly  by  municipal-owned  utilities.  Water \nsupply  infrastructure  financed  by  the  project  will  thus  be  among  a  small  number  of  water \ndistribution  utilities  managed  by  private  sector  in  the  country.  For  second-  and  third-tier  cities, \nthe  project  will  support  capacity  additions  which  contribute  to  their  economic  plans.  The \ninclusion  of  best-practice  corporate  governance  conditions  in  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  strengthen  the \nmanagement  standards  for  operational  turnaround  through  privatization.  In  addition,  the \nproject\u2019s  B-loan  will  facilitate  international  lending  to  the  PRC  water  distribution  subsector, \nhelping to address the constraints private developers face in securing private sector financing.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n31. \nThe economic benefits are significant and include (i) the value of clean water delivered, \n(ii)  reductions  in  water  loss  during  distribution,  and  (iii)  unquantified  reductions  in  pollutants \nduring  distribution.  The  expected  economic  internal  rate  of  return  from  the  quantified  benefits \nand costs is 18%.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguard \n\n32. \nCWA will ensure that subprojects for ADB financing will comply with specified eligibility \ncriteria and only include rehabilitation and expansion of water treatment plants and water supply \nnetworks. 25  These  water  treatment  plants  will  be  connected  to  rivers,  streams,  or  existing \nreservoirs  established  by  the  local  government.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the \nenvironment as non-significant environmental impacts are anticipated. Pipeline networks will be \nrearranged,  new  pumping  stations  built,  and  water  treatment  plants  expanded  in  cities,  which \nmay  require  small  parcels  of  land.  Hence,  the  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement and C for indigenous peoples. \n \nThe  project  is  in  the  corporate  finance  category  under  the  special  requirements  for \n33. \ndifferent finance modalities of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The safeguard due diligence \nundertaken included a corporate audit of CWA\u2019s ESMS, and past and present performance with \nregards  to  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  In  2008,  CWA  adopted  an  extensive \nenvironment,  health,  safety,  and  social  (EHSS)  management  manual  and  appointed  staff  to \nensure its implementation. CWA has confirmed its commitment to revise the EHSS to meet the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements,  and  to  have  the  new  system  (including  the \nappointment  of  a  senior  manager)  and  capacity  building  plans  in  place  before  the  first \ndisbursement.  \n \n \n\n2. \n\nGender, Labor, and Working Conditions \n\n34. \nCWA  upholds  gender  equality  and  provides  equal  employment  opportunities  for  men \nand  women.  Women  occupy  key  managerial  and  technical  positions  in  plants  visited  during \nADB\u2019s  due  diligence.  About  30%\u201340%  of  the  staff  members  required  to  run  the  plants  visited \nare women working in the administration, operations, and technical departments. CWA provides \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB funds will not be used to finance wastewater subprojects or any new dam, reservoir, or water impoundment. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nsocial  benefits  to  staff  members,  which  include  pension,  medical  insurance,  work  injury \ninsurance, maternity leave, and a social housing fund. CWA has human resource policies and \nprocedures covering recruitment, induction, rewards, disciplinary procedures, and labor contract \nmanagement. The policies and procedures were formulated in consultation with employees and \nare  communicated  to  all  new  employees  during  induction.  CWA  will  ensure  that  contractors\u2019 \nemployment contracts include provisions covering core labor standards and national laws. The \nESMS  will  include  requirements  to  monitor  the  working  conditions  of  workers  employed  by \ncontractors  to  ensure  compliance  with  core  labor  standards  and  national  labor  laws  and \nregulations. \n \n35. \nThe  design  of  water  supply  subprojects  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  carefully  consider \ngender issues as part of the environmental and social assessment, and women will be involved \nin the consultations for future subprojects. These requirements will be outlined in the ESMS.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  CNY2.6  billion  during  FY2012\u2013FY2015,  including  the \n36. \ncosts  of  acquiring  existing  assets,  rehabilitating  and  expanding  networks,  installing  electrical \ncontrol equipment, and other installation expenses. ADB\u2019s loan will fund part of the investment \nplan.  The  remaining  funding  is  expected  to  come  from  (i)  debt  financing  from  bilateral  and \ncommercial banks, and (ii) internally generated cash from CWA\u2019s operations.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Development \n\n37. \nCWA  will  control  project  development  and  financing  arrangements.  CWA  will  acquire \nmajority  share  ownership  and  management  control  of  municipal  water  supply  utilities.  Each \nacquired  utility  will  be  owned  by  a  subproject  company,  which  will  be  established  for  the \npurpose  of  rehabilitating,  expanding,  and  operating  the  utility\u2019s  networks and  treatment  plants. \nThis  subproject  structure  will  enable  CWA  to  respond  to  local  market  conditions  effectively, \nparticularly  with  regard  to  issues  arising  from  the  quality  of  management;  operational  policy; \nbudget,  financial  and  accounting  procedures;  and  network connectivity.  CWA  will  appoint  staff \nfor all key management positions (including general manager, financial controller, and technical \ndirector)  and  will  have  full  control  over  (i)  management  policy;  (ii)  budget,  and  financial  and \naccounting procedures; and (iii) construction and operation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n38. \nCWA was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and Policy \non  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require CWA and \nCIL  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and the borrowers will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation \n\n39. \nDuring  project  implementation,  ADB  will  receive  reports  regularly  on  its  financial  and \noperational  indicators,  as  well  as  other  information  that  ADB  and  CWA  will  agree  upon. \nReporting  will  cover  (i)  the  financial statements,  (ii)  calculations  and  compliance  certificates  of \nthe  financial  covenants,  (iii)  the  business  plans,  (iv) reports  on  the  progress  and  costs  of \nsubproject construction, (v) the amount of water sold, and (vi) operation and maintenance and \nother administrative costs. ADB will conduct annual reviews to monitor environmental and social \nsafeguard  compliance,  credit  assessments  of  the  subprojects,  and  a  review  of  development \nimpacts, among other items. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nLoan \n\n40. \nADB's  proposed  loan  will  have  two  components:  (i)  a  dual  currency,  US  dollar\u2013yuan \ndirect loan (A-loan) in aggregate of up to $100 million equivalent funded by ADB, and (ii) a B-\nloan  of  up  to  $100  million  funded  by  commercial  banks.  The  A-loan  will  have  two  borrowers: \nCWA  as  the  US  dollar  borrower  and  CIL  as  yuan  borrower.    The  A-loan  will  carry  an  interest \nrate and commitment and front-end fees as approved by ADB's Investment Committee.  \n \nThe B-loan of up to $100 million will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \n41. \nA-loan, and will be on terms and conditions to be agreed.  B-loan syndication will be undertaken \non a best-efforts basis.  \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance \n\n42. \nimpacts  and \nis \ndemonstration effects. It will support the government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n \n\nits  development \n\njustified  by \n\nthe  project \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDespite  the  successful  private  sector  participation  in  water  treatment  and \nwastewater  treatment  plants  on  a  BOT  basis,  municipal  water  supply  services \nare  provided  mainly  by  utility  companies  owned  by  municipal  governments. \nDifficulties  in  raising  financing  for  projects,  particularly  in  smaller  cities,  have \nconstrained the maintenance, rehabilitation, and expansion of pipeline networks. \nThe  project  features  a  strong  model  for  addressing  disproportionately  high \ntransaction  costs  of  medium-  and  small-sized  water  supply  project  finance.  Its \nmulti-project  financing  structure  will  enable  ADB  to  extend  its  reach  to  multiple \nsmaller subprojects that are difficult to assist directly. ADB support is essential for \nholding  companies\u2019  development  of  multiple  projects,  and  it  will  catalyze  other \ncommercial financing. \nADB\u2019s  loan  conditions,  such  as  more  transparent  corporate  governance  in \naccordance  with  OECD  principles26 and  an  ESMS  to  cover  projects  (including \nthose beyond ADB-funded subprojects) support the long-term sustainable growth \nof CWA and set standards for the restructuring of municipal utility companies. \n\n                                                 \n26  OECD. 2004. Principles of Corporate Governance. Paris. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  presence  of  ADB  reaffirms  CWA\u2019s  long-term  strategic  commitment  to  the \nwater distribution subsector. ADB\u2019s participation in the project is also expected to \nincrease  the  confidence  of  the  private  sector  in  participating  in  and  financing \nfuture water distribution projects in the PRC. \n\n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 27  the \n43. \ngovernment has been requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance \nto CWA and CIL. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, following \nthe approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n44. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  to  China  Water  Affairs  Group  Limited  and  China  Water  Affairs  Investment \nLimited for the Municipal Water Distribution Infrastructure Development Project in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, consisting of:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nan A-loan denominated in US dollar\u2013yuan dual currency, in an aggregate amount \nof up to $100,000,000 equivalent, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and  \na B-loan in an amount of up to $100,000,000, to be funded by commercial banks,  \n\n \non  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \n \nC.
