THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto China Water Affairs Group Limited (CWA) and China Water Affairs Investment Limited (CIL) \nfor the Municipal Water Distribution Infrastructure Development Project in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC).1  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  In response to the PRC's increasing challenges in ensuring livable cities and sustainable \neconomic development, municipal environmental infrastructure has been a focus area of Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) private sector operations\u2019 business development in the country since \n2006. The successful implementation of ADB\u2019s municipal infrastructure projects funded by local \ncurrency bonds2 generated considerable interest among private sector sponsors and financial \ninstitutions, as lack of access to finance has been a bottleneck for private participation in urban \nenvironmental infrastructure. It was discovered that CWA is a private sector front runner with a \npioneering  business  model  and  strong  execution  ability.  Through  due  diligence,  ADB \ndetermined that the proposed project supports ADB\u2019s strategies for environmental sustainability, \ninclusive growth, and financial and technical feasibility. In addition to facilitating investments by \nCWA,  ADB's  assistance  is  expected  to  bring  significant  developmental  benefits,  including \nsupporting  private  sector  participation  in  the  newly  opened  water  distribution  subsector, \ncatalyzing  local  and  international  commercial  financing,  and  supporting  the  government's \nobjective of improving the urban environment in the country.   \n   \nB.  Sector Background  \n1.  The Urban Water Sector in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n3.  Successful  economic  reforms  and  significant  growth  of  the  PRC  economy  have \naccelerated urbanization. The country\u2019s urban population has more than tripled from 190 million \nin 1980 to 607 million in 2008, accounting for 45.7% of the national population; it is expected to \naccount for 55.0% of the total by 2020, an incremental increase of about 200 million people. \nThis demographic shift has continuously increased the need for water access and reliability. \nAlthough more than 90% of the urban population has access to piped water, capacity to fulfill \n\u201clast mile\u201d connections to newly urbanizing areas is critically short.  \n \n4.  When the economy was centrally planned, the provision of water was considered a basic \nsocial right and was heavily subsidized by the government. Water supply companies owned by \nlocal governments owned charged limited fees for the consumption of resources and provision \nof services. This system led to a scarcity of capital for the construction, renovation, operation, \nand maintenance of water infrastructure. The lack of expansion and maintenance of pipelines, \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Policy and Regulatory Framework \n5.  The government\u2019s water policy aims to (i) develop water sources; (ii) protect existing \nsources  by  controlling  industrial  and  residential  pollution;  (iii)  introduce  water-efficient \ntechnologies and operations; and (iv) implement appropriate pricing mechanisms to encourage \nconservation and generate necessary funds for operation, maintenance, and investment. The \ngovernment\u2019s  economic  and  enterprise  reform  programs  require  that  all  water  supply  and \nwastewater projects be financially sustainable and capable of recovering costs. \n \n 6.  Oversight of the urban water sector is coordinated by the central government, which sets \npolicies, standards, and guidelines for drinking water quality; wastewater discharge; and the \nplanning  and  construction  of  water,  wastewater,  and  drainage  infrastructure. 3 Provincial \nagencies set implementing regulations; approve selected actions of municipal agencies such as \ntariff adjustments, and large investment projects; and oversee compliance with water supply and \nwastewater  standards.  Municipal  governments  are  responsible  for  providing  water  and \nwastewater services, typically through a municipally owned company, and setting tariffs.  \n \n7.  Policies  to  commercialize  the  municipal  water  supply  sector  began  in  1998  with  a \nnational policy mandating that urban water utilities earn a return on equity and introducing clear \ntariff-setting procedures.4 Subsequent directives sought to commercialize the sector further: (i) \nthe 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) recommended setting water tariffs according to supply \nand demand, and the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) emphasized improvements in water \nintensity (i.e., reducing the amount of water used per unit of economic output); (ii) the Water  \nLaw was revised in 2002 to allow customers to be charged for the volume of water consumed; \n(iii) five ministry-level bodies, including the National Development and Reform Commission \n(NDRC), in 2002 jointly issued a nationwide framework for urban water tariff determination, \nincluding formalizing the requirement that operation, maintenance, and debt service costs be \nrecovered through tariffs and other user fees;5 and (iv) various agencies have instituted a series \nof complementary policies, such as the \u201cone meter per household\u201d policy to reduce nonrevenue \nwater6 and improve water quality. In 2009, the NDRC and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-\nRural Development (MOHURD) announced priorities for urban water distribution tariffs:7 (i) \nraising tariffs gradually to encourage conservation and efficiency, (ii) increasing transparency, \n                                                 \n3  Several ministries carry out these functions: the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) oversees water resource \nallocation as well as usage in rural areas (irrigation and residential); the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural \nDevelopment (MOHURD, formerly the Ministry of Construction) regulates engineering and urban water use; the \nMinistry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP)  regulates  pollution  and  wastewater  treatment;  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) oversees tariff policy; while the Ministry of Health issues standards \nfor the quality of residential tap water. \n4  NDRC and MOHURD. 1998. Administrative Measures on Tariffs for Town Water Supply. Beijing. (23 September \n1998, amended 29 November 2004). The measures provide benchmarks for an average rate of return on equity for \nmunicipal  water  utilities,  i.e.,  from  8%\u201312%  for  utilities  with  private  investment  and  not  exceeding  6%  for \ngovernment-owned utilities.  \n5  NDRC, Ministry of Finance, MOHURD, MWR, and MEP. 2002.

Beijing.  \n ", "3 \n \n(iii) setting block tariffs (progressive by volume) to encourage conservation, (iv) establishing \nsimple sector categories for tariffs, (v) incorporating pro-poor affordability measures, and (vi) \nraising public awareness of water issues. In its first policy circular of 2011, the State Council \nemphasized  the  need  to  \u201caccelerate  reform  and  development\u201d  of  the  water  supply  sector, \nincluding the reform of tariffs.8 The 12th Five Year Plan (2011\u20132015) announced in March 2011 \nfurther emphasizes water efficiency, with a 30% cut in water intensity targeted by 2015.   \n \n8.  According to the national tariff guidelines, water distribution tariffs are to be set on a \ncost-plus basis, including the costs of treated water, costs of distribution, specified rates of \nreturn, and taxes.9 In practice, municipalities are raising tariffs at varying paces to reach the \nmandated levels of cost recovery and returns. The average residential tariff in the PRC\u2019s 35 \nlargest cities at the end of 2008 was CNY2.4 per cubic meter, including CNY0.7 per cubic meter \nfor wastewater treatment charges. By international standards, this tariff level is low: household \nwater expenses in these 35 cities account for about 1% of total family disposable income, below \nthe global average of 2%\u20135%. ADB has recommended that water tariffs be increased to help \npromote conservation and to make water utilities financially sustainable, and has encouraged \nmunicipal water authorities to \u201censure the water tariff adjustment process is carried out smoothly \nand on-time.\u201d10 \n \n9.  Quality  standards  are  increasing.  For  drinking  water,  new  standards,  which  were \nintroduced in 2006 in line with World Health Organization requirements and best practices in \ndeveloped countries, have increased the number and stringency of indicators tested.11 Higher \nstandards increase the investment requirements for treatment, delivery, and monitoring and \ntesting systems. Moreover, the government has identified urban and rural water quality as a key \ndevelopment task for the 12th Five Year Plan.   \n \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n10.  While PRC water treatment and wastewater treatment projects have been undertaken by \na wide range of private sector developers since the late 1990s, private sector investment in \nthese areas has been largely based on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model. Building on \npolicies to commercialize municipal water distribution and treatment (para. 7), the government \nhas encouraged private sector participation in the municipal water supply sector. In 2004, water \ndistribution in medium-sized and small cities was opened to joint ventures involving foreign \ninvestors. Further, a standard concession agreement template was promulgated to facilitate \nprivate sector participation.12 In 2005 and annually during 2007\u20132010, the State Council issued \npolicies  encouraging  the  investment,  construction,  and  operation  of  water  distribution  and \ntreatment by private entities, and mandating municipalities to allow such participation.13  \n                                                 \n8  State Council. 2011.

(23 September     \n1998, amended 29 November 2004). Under these measures, the cost of treated water refers to the raw water tariff  \nand any other direct expenses from the process of water treatment (including electricity; chemicals and other          \nmaterials; depreciation; maintenance and repair; labor; and quality inspecting, monitoring, and testing). The cost of \ndistribution includes sales, management, and financial costs. Water lost during distribution is considered a cost.   \nReturns are to be set according to whether the utility is private-invested or government-owned (see footnote 4). \n10  ADB. 2009.

Nonetheless,  in  water  distribution  private  participation  has  remained  limited,  often \ninvolving  only  minority  investments  in  municipal  utilities.  Utilities  owned  by  municipal \ngovernments still own and operate more than 90% of the PRC\u2019s municipal water distribution \nnetworks. Given the substantial level of investment required to rehabilitate and expand water \npipeline networks and the limited self-financing capacity of municipal-owned utilities, increased \nprivate  ownership  and  operation  of  water  distribution  are  expected  to  improve  operational \nefficiency and help achieve the government\u2019s water efficiency and quality goals.  \n \n12.  Financing has constrained the ability of private sector developers to scale up their \noperations. In studies of the PRC municipal water sector, the World Bank has concluded that \nfinancing  remains  one  of  the  critical  barriers  to  better  sector  performance.14 Local  banks \ntypically prefer to lend to large state-owned firms, and are averse to lending to newly privatized \ncompanies. Private companies also have difficulty tapping the enterprise bond market, as bond \nissuance in the PRC is time-consuming, complicated, and subject to numerous approvals.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n13.  The project is consistent with Strategy 2020, which emphasizes support for achieving \npoverty reduction and inclusive growth through environmentally sustainable development and \nprivate sector development.15 The strategy identifies infrastructure and the environment as two \nof the five core areas in which ADB will employ its financial and institutional resources to \nmaximize results, efficiency, and impact. In terms of infrastructure, the project is in line with \nStrategy 2020\u2019s emphasis on public\u2013private partnerships and private sector engagement. ADB \nwill also seek to improve human health through interventions in water supply, sanitation, and \nwaste  management.  With  regard  to  the  environment,  ADB  will  assist  developing  member \ncountries  and  their  municipalities  in  addressing  a  range  of  problems  resulting  from  rapid \nurbanization. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n14.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC is based on four development pillars: \n(i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.16 The project reinforces each of these pillars, with particular support \nfor pillars (ii) and (iv). It will be integral to ADB\u2019s efforts to help improve urban environment in the \nPRC.  \n \n15.  The PRC has been steadily turning to development that is market-oriented and led by \nthe private sector, which has become the driving force for economic growth and job creation. \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure, energy, finance, and \nenvironmental improvement, and build on ADB\u2019s public sector policy advice to the government \non  private  sector  development.  For  infrastructure,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with \n                                                                                                                                                          \nDevelopment of Individual and Private Economy and Other Non-Public Sectors of the Economy.

As  agreed  with  the \ngovernment, ADB\u2019s private sector operations focus on viable projects located in less-developed \nregions and explore the possibility of loans funded by ADB\u2019s yuan-denominated bonds. As a \nfinancially strong project focused mainly on a sector newly opened to private sector participation \nand with the option to be partly funded through a yuan loan, the project is consistent with these \naims.  \n \n16.  The  project  will  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  in  the  PRC  and  will \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  overall  support  for  urban  development  in  the  PRC  through  investment \nprojects  and  knowledge  products.  In  particular,  the  project  benefits  from  public  sector \noperations\u2019 policy advice and lessons learned from public sector water supply projects.17  \n \n3.  Consistency with the Water Policy \n17.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy, 18  which  emphasizes  careful \nmanagement and participatory approaches to conserve water. In response to the huge unmet \nwater needs in Asia and the Pacific, and consistent with the recommendations of various \ninternational initiatives to double water investments, ADB has made water a core business area \nand envisages doubling its water investments to more than $2 billion annually.19 \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n18.  The  project  will  expand  and  improve  water  distribution  coverage,  develop  related \ntransmission and treatment infrastructure, and increase the quality and reliability of water supply \nto cities through private sector participation.  \n \n1.  The Sponsor and the Borrowers \n19.  The project will have two borrowers: CWA for the US dollar tranche and for the yuan \ntranche, CIL, a holding company for CWA\u2019s urban water supply operations in the PRC. \n \n20.  CWA,  the  sponsor  and  the  borrower  representative  for  the  ADB  loan,  is  a  private \ncompany listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. CWA specializes in urban water operations \nin the PRC. Following the government\u2019s policy to encourage private sector investment in the \nurban water sector, CWA was founded by a team of senior managers with strong water supply \nexperience in the PRC and a good reputation. CWA has grown rapidly to establish itself as a \npioneering private sector company in the PRC water supply industry.. \n \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2007.

In 2003, CWA launched its operations as \none of the first private companies to own and operate water distribution networks in the PRC. \nAbout 85% of CWA\u2019s revenues are from water treatment and distribution, although the company \nalso operates wastewater treatment plants in locations where the local governments request \nCWA to expand beyond municipal water supply. At the end of 2010, the company operated \nmunicipal water supply utilities under concessions or similar arrangements in 23 cities, with a \ntotal distribution capacity of 4.1 mcm per day and wastewater treatment capacity of 0.2 mcm per \nday.20 CWA employs more than 4,500 people in the PRC. \n \n22.  CWA\u2019s strategy is to acquire underperforming water supply utilities from municipalities \nand improve their operational and financial performance. Many PRC distribution utilities owned \nby  municipal governments are inefficient and undercapitalized, often leading to incomplete \nmetering, low returns, and gradual infrastructure degradation. CWA expands coverage of its \nsubprojects  to  link  neighboring  networks  and  connect  new  economic  development  zones. \nThrough technical improvements, CWA can reduce nonrevenue water and turn around a utility\u2019s \nperformance.21 CWA replaces outdated pipes and reconfigures network layouts; adds pump \nstations to control pressure throughout the network; and locates pipeline leaks with centrally \ncontrolled pressure and flow monitors and acoustic detection equipment. By rehabilitating older \npipeline systems, CWA also reduces secondary pollution caused by pipeline corrosion or other \ncontamination. CWA installs meters at each end user and introduces billing systems to facilitate \npayment (e.g., bank debit, prepaid cards, and cash at CWA service counters) and service \nimprovements  (e.g.,  24-hour  hotlines  and  rapid-response  repair  teams).  Through  these \ninvestments,  end  users  benefit  from  increased  water  availability,  stable  pressure,  water  at \nquality standards, and improved customer care. \n \n23.  CWA  can  further  improve  operations  of  subprojects  through  the  introduction  of \ncommercial management systems. Standard measures introduced at newly privatized utilities \ninclude  (i)  seconding  senior  management  in  the  initial  stage  after  acquisition;  (ii)  setting \ncompany performance targets; (iii) creating key performance indicators (KPIs) for all staff;22 (iv) \nlinking KPIs to bonuses and promotions; (v) training managerial and technical staff; and (vi) \nsharing knowledge between the acquired utility and other subproject companies through senior \nmanager rotations, company-wide meetings to share experiences and best practices, and use \nof shared technical experts based at regional hubs. CWA also maintains a system of operational \nand financial reporting and benchmarking on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n24.  CWA will use the ADB assistance to fund a series of water treatment and distribution \nsubprojects with total capacity of up to 2 mcm per day by FY2015. The project is designed to be \na least-cost solution to financing medium-sized water supply projects, the financing of which \ninvolves  relatively  high  transaction  costs.  ADB  and  CWA  aim  to  finance  the water  supply \ninfrastructure projects on a portfolio basis to reduce financing transaction costs and diversify \nrisk. This portfolio approach, broad in reach, will enable ADB to provide financing support for \n                                                 \n20 CWA holds a 1.6% share of PRC tap water capacity and 0.5% share of wastewater treatment capacity. \n21 CWA\u2019s success in reducing nonrevenue water depends on site-specific factors. Sites examined in due diligence \nrecorded 3%\u20134% point average annual reductions in nonrevenue water during 2008\u20132010. \n22 CWA\u2019s KPIs at the utility level include improvement in the nonrevenue rate; improvement in the fee collection rate; \nincreases in operating efficiency (e.g., per-unit consumption of electricity, chemicals, or other inputs); reductions in \noperating costs; improvement in the compliance rate with water quality standards; and avoidance of operational \nfailures or safety incidents.  These utility KPIs are mapped to individual-level performance targets for all staff. \n ", "7 \n \nmultiple  water  supply  projects  that  are  often  too  small  and  time-consuming  for  ADB  or \ninternational banks to finance on a stand-alone basis.  \n \n25.  Major investments at each subproject will be completed in the following five critical areas \nas soon as practical upon CWA\u2019s takeover: (i) repairing or replacing old pipelines and upgrading \nwater treatment plants; (ii) optimizing network connections by introducing pumping stations and \nchanging the diameter of pipes; (iii) centralizing management and dispatching systems, which \ninvolves a new information technology system, a network operation system, remote supervision \nof  the  network,  and  automation  of  pumping  stations;  (iv)  expanding  and  densifying  water \ndistribution networks; and (v) expanding the water treatment plants after the network coverage \nreaches a critical mass.  \n  \n26.  To achieve long-term environmentally sustainable growth and to set standards in the \nfast-growing  water  supply  industry,  the  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  incorporate  loan \nconditions, such as the maintenance of a transparent corporate governance structure and the \nadoption  and  maintenance  of  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS) \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). These components of the project are \nexpected to serve as best-practice examples to CWA\u2019s peers in the industry, enhancing its \ndemonstration effects.  \n \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n27.  The project output is the efficient operation at designed performance levels of up to 2 \nmcm per day of water supply facilities that comply with ADB safeguards and technical and \nfinancial eligibility criteria. The project's expected outcome is improved water supply services in \nsecond- and third-tier cities.  \n   \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n28.  The project directly contributes to basic human needs by expanding access to clean \nwater and by mitigating secondary pollution during distribution of water to urban households and \nindustries in second- and third-tier cities in the PRC. Poor people are most vulnerable to \nenvironment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical attention \nfor digestive tract ailments associated with drinking polluted water.  \n \n29.  The project will improve water efficiency by supporting private sector participation in \nwater distribution to increase service quality and coverage, reduce costs, and improve financial \nviability. Reducing inefficiencies in water distribution and improving the supply of clean drinking \nwater  is  a  component  of  pro-poor  development.23 The  project  will  also  contribute  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s long-term plans to reduce the national nonrevenue water ratio to 12%. Lower \nrates of nonrevenue water are typically associated with improved tap water access for poorer \nurban households.24  \n \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2010.

Private Sector Development \n30.  The project supports the government\u2019s strategy to encourage private sector participation \nin urban water supply services which are provided mainly by municipal-owned utilities. Water \nsupply infrastructure financed by the project will thus be among a small number of water \ndistribution utilities managed by private sector in the country. For second- and third-tier cities, \nthe  project  will  support  capacity  additions  which  contribute  to  their  economic  plans.  The \ninclusion of best-practice corporate governance conditions in ADB\u2019s loan will strengthen the \nmanagement  standards  for  operational  turnaround  through  privatization.  In  addition,  the \nproject\u2019s B-loan will facilitate international lending to the PRC water distribution subsector, \nhelping to address the constraints private developers face in securing private sector financing.  \n \n3.  Economic Sustainability \n31.  The economic benefits are significant and include (i) the value of clean water delivered, \n(ii) reductions in water loss during distribution, and (iii) unquantified reductions in pollutants \nduring distribution. The expected economic internal rate of return from the quantified benefits \nand costs is 18%.  \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions   \n1.  Environment and Social Safeguard \n32.  CWA will ensure that subprojects for ADB financing will comply with specified eligibility \ncriteria and only include rehabilitation and expansion of water treatment plants and water supply \nnetworks.25 These  water  treatment  plants  will  be  connected  to  rivers,  streams,  or  existing \nreservoirs established by the local government. The project is classified as category B for the \nenvironment as non-significant environmental impacts are anticipated. Pipeline networks will be \nrearranged, new pumping stations built, and water treatment plants expanded in cities, which \nmay  require  small  parcels  of  land.  Hence,  the  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement and C for indigenous peoples. \n \n33.  The project is in the corporate finance category under the special requirements for \ndifferent finance modalities of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The safeguard due diligence \nundertaken included a corporate audit of CWA\u2019s ESMS, and past and present performance with \nregards  to  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  In  2008,  CWA  adopted  an  extensive \nenvironment, health, safety, and social (EHSS) management manual and appointed staff to \nensure its implementation. CWA has confirmed its commitment to revise the EHSS to meet the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements,  and  to  have  the  new  system  (including  the \nappointment  of  a  senior  manager)  and  capacity  building  plans  in  place  before  the  first \ndisbursement.  \n \n \n2.  Gender, Labor, and Working Conditions \n34.  CWA upholds gender equality and provides equal employment opportunities for men \nand women. Women occupy key managerial and technical positions in plants visited during \nADB\u2019s due diligence. About 30%\u201340% of the staff members required to run the plants visited \nare women working in the administration, operations, and technical departments. CWA provides \n                                                 \n25 ADB funds will not be used to finance wastewater subprojects or any new dam, reservoir, or water impoundment. \n ", "9 \n \nsocial  benefits  to  staff  members,  which  include  pension,  medical  insurance,  work  injury \ninsurance, maternity leave, and a social housing fund. CWA has human resource policies and \nprocedures covering recruitment, induction, rewards, disciplinary procedures, and labor contract \nmanagement. The policies and procedures were formulated in consultation with employees and \nare communicated to all new employees during induction. CWA will ensure that contractors\u2019 \nemployment contracts include provisions covering core labor standards and national laws. The \nESMS will include requirements to monitor the working conditions of workers employed by \ncontractors  to  ensure  compliance  with  core  labor  standards  and  national  labor  laws  and \nregulations. \n \n35.  The design of water supply subprojects to be financed by ADB will carefully consider \ngender issues as part of the environmental and social assessment, and women will be involved \nin the consultations for future subprojects. These requirements will be outlined in the ESMS.  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n36.  The project is estimated to cost CNY2.6 billion during FY2012\u2013FY2015, including the \ncosts of acquiring existing assets, rehabilitating and expanding networks, installing electrical \ncontrol equipment, and other installation expenses. ADB\u2019s loan will fund part of the investment \nplan. The remaining funding is expected to come from (i) debt financing from bilateral and \ncommercial banks, and (ii) internally generated cash from CWA\u2019s operations.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Development \n37.  CWA will control project development and financing arrangements. CWA will acquire \nmajority share ownership and management control of municipal water supply utilities. Each \nacquired  utility  will  be  owned  by  a  subproject  company,  which  will  be  established  for  the \npurpose of rehabilitating, expanding, and operating the utility\u2019s networks and treatment plants. \nThis subproject structure will enable CWA to respond to local market conditions effectively, \nparticularly with regard to issues arising from the quality of management; operational policy; \nbudget, financial and accounting procedures; and network connectivity. CWA will appoint staff \nfor all key management positions (including general manager, financial controller, and technical \ndirector) and will have full control over (i) management policy; (ii) budget, and financial and \naccounting procedures; and (iii) construction and operation.  \n \n2.  Anticorruption Policy  \n38.  CWA was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and Policy \non Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require CWA and \nCIL  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and the borrowers will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n ", "10 \n \n3.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation \n39.  During project implementation, ADB will receive reports regularly on its financial and \noperational  indicators,  as  well  as  other  information  that  ADB  and  CWA  will  agree  upon. \nReporting will cover (i) the financial statements, (ii) calculations and compliance certificates of \nthe  financial  covenants,  (iii)  the  business  plans,  (iv) reports  on  the  progress  and  costs  of \nsubproject construction, (v) the amount of water sold, and (vi) operation and maintenance and \nother administrative costs. ADB will conduct annual reviews to monitor environmental and social \nsafeguard compliance, credit assessments of the subprojects, and a review of development \nimpacts, among other items. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  Loan \n40.  ADB's proposed loan will have two components: (i) a dual currency, US dollar\u2013yuan \ndirect loan (A-loan) in aggregate of up to $100 million equivalent funded by ADB, and (ii) a B-\nloan of up to $100 million funded by commercial banks. The A-loan will have two borrowers: \nCWA as the US dollar borrower and CIL as yuan borrower.  The A-loan will carry an interest \nrate and commitment and front-end fees as approved by ADB's Investment Committee.  \n \n41.  The B-loan of up to $100 million will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan, and will be on terms and conditions to be agreed.  B-loan syndication will be undertaken \non a best-efforts basis.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n42.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  project  is  justified  by  its  development  impacts  and \ndemonstration effects. It will support the government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n \n(i)  Despite  the  successful  private  sector  participation  in  water  treatment  and \nwastewater treatment plants on a BOT basis, municipal water supply services \nare  provided  mainly  by  utility  companies  owned  by  municipal  governments. \nDifficulties in raising financing for projects, particularly in smaller cities, have \nconstrained the maintenance, rehabilitation, and expansion of pipeline networks. \nThe  project  features  a  strong  model  for  addressing  disproportionately  high \ntransaction costs of medium- and small-sized water supply project finance. Its \nmulti-project financing structure will enable ADB to extend its reach to multiple \nsmaller subprojects that are difficult to assist directly. ADB support is essential for \nholding companies\u2019 development of multiple projects, and it will catalyze other \ncommercial financing. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s  loan  conditions,  such  as  more  transparent  corporate  governance  in \naccordance with OECD principles26 and an ESMS to cover projects (including \nthose beyond ADB-funded subprojects) support the long-term sustainable growth \nof CWA and set standards for the restructuring of municipal utility companies. \n                                                 \n26  OECD. 2004. Principles of Corporate Governance. Paris. \n ", "11 \n \n(iii)  The presence of ADB reaffirms CWA\u2019s long-term strategic commitment to the \nwater distribution subsector. ADB\u2019s participation in the project is also expected to \nincrease the confidence of the private sector in participating in and financing \nfuture water distribution projects in the PRC. \n \nC.  Assurances \n43.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 27  the \ngovernment has been requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance \nto CWA and CIL. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, following \nthe approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan to China Water Affairs Group Limited and China Water Affairs Investment \nLimited for the Municipal Water Distribution Infrastructure Development Project in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, consisting of:  \n \n(i)  an A-loan denominated in US dollar\u2013yuan dual currency, in an aggregate amount \nof up to $100,000,000 equivalent, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and  \n(ii)  a B-loan in an amount of up to $100,000,000, to be funded by commercial banks,  \n \non such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nC.
