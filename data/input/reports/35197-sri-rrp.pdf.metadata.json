The  Project  will  build  on  the  outputs  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)-assisted  Skills  Development  Project \n(SDP),  particularly  the  national  vocational  qualifications  (NVQ) \nframework. \n \nThe Project will develop new technician diploma programs within \nthe  NVQ  framework  and  upgrade  six  technical  colleges  (TCs)  to \nCoTs  in  six  out  of  nine  provinces  to  conduct  the  programs. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  MSDVTE  and  relevant  institutions  so \nthey  can  facilitate,  support,  and  ensure  quality,  efficient,  and \nsustainable  TEVT,  focusing  on  NVQ  levels  5\u20137.  The  Project  will \nhelp  the  Government  establish  Univotec,  which  will  address  the \nshortage  of  technologists  and  qualified  instructors  for  TEVT,  and \nprovide an alternative education and career pathway for students \nand TEVT sector personnel, leading to a degree. The Project will, \namong others, develop degree programs leading to a bachelor of \ntechnical  education  (B.Tech.Ed.)  and  a  bachelor  of  technology \n(B.Tech.), and upgrade the facilities and equipment of institutions \ncomprising Univotec so it can offer these programs. \n \nThe Project complements the assistance of development partners \nin  upgrading  TCs  in  other  provinces  to  offer  technician  diploma \nprograms, and in establishing Univotec. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nThe  Government  is  reducing  unemployment  and  responding  to \nthe changing labor market by combining short- and medium-term \nstrategies.  In  the  short  term,  the  Government  is  exploring  the \npossibility  of  expanding  local  and  foreign  skilled  and  semiskilled \nemployment while, over the medium term, according high priority \nto manufacturing-based growth with increased foreign investment. \nThis  strategy  requires  highly  trained  labor,  including  technicians \nand technologists, who are in short supply. \n \nLocally,  the  supply  of  technicians  and  mid-level  professionals  is \nfalling short of demand, while Sri Lanka has been unable to fill a \nsignificant  portion  of  job  orders  abroad  for  mid-level  and  skilled \n(and  higher-wage)  worker  categories,  whose  proportion  among \noverseas Sri Lankans is increasing.  \n \nDespite the large supply\u2013demand gap, unemployment, especially \namong  educated  youth,  is  high.  The  large  number  of  school \nleavers  lack  the  skills  for  jobs  or  self-employment.  These  youths \ncould  be  employed  in  industry  if  they  were  trained  in  relevant \ntechnical and vocational skills.  \n \nTEVT at the technician and technologist levels is underdeveloped \nand cannot produce enough qualified skilled workers for either the \ndomestic  or  foreign  market.  TEVT  needs  to  expand  access  to \ntraining  programs  throughout  the  country  while  increasing  the \nquality  and  market  relevance  of  its  programs;  improving  the \nqualifications  and  numbers  of  TEVT  teaching-training  personnel, \nparticularly  for  technician  and  technologist  programs;  allocating \nfinancial resources to run training programs after the Project; and \nupgrading TEVT\u2019s social image. \n \nThe Project will develop more mid-level and highly skilled human \nto  economic  growth  and  social \nresources \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  envisioned  outcome  is  improved  access  and \nstrengthened capacity of TEVT to meet labor market needs.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $26.7  million  equivalent, \nincluding  taxes,  duties,  interest  charges  on  the  ADB  loan,  and \nphysical  and  price  contingencies.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated  at  $9.9  million  (37%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  at \n$16.8  million  (63%)  equivalent.  The  loan  will  cover  75%  of  the \ntotal project cost. ADB will fund 100% ($9.9 million) of the foreign \ncurrency  cost  and  60%  ($10.1  million  equivalent)  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  Interest  during  project  implementation  will  be \ncapitalized.  The  remaining  $6.7  million  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost will be provided by the Government.  \n \n\nto  contribute \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n\f \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nv\n\n               ($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n 20.0  \n 6.7  \n 26.7  \n\nPercent \n\n \n75 \n25 \n100 \n\n \n 10.1  \n 6.7  \n 16.8  \n\nSource \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\n \n 9.9  \n 0.0  \n 9.9  \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR13,605,000  ($20 million)  equivalent  from  the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  of  ADB  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 years, \nan  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n28 February 2011 \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n31 August 2011 \n \n \nMinistry of Skills Development, Vocational and Technical \nEducation (MSDVTE) \n \nA project steering committee (PSC) will direct the Project, monitor \nits  activities  and  outputs,  guide  the  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU),  and  coordinate  and  liaise  with  other  government  agencies \nand departments. \n \nThe  MSDVTE  secretary  will  chair  the  PSC,  whose  members  will \ncomprise  representatives  from  the  Ceylon\u2013German  Technical \nInstitute;  Department  of  Technical  Education  and \nTraining \nTraining;  National  Apprentice  and  Industrial  Training  Authority; \nNational Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka; Tertiary and \nVocational  Education  Commission;  Vocational  Training  Authority; \nUnivotec;  Ministry  of  Education  with  responsibility  for  higher \neducation;  and  External  Resources  Department,  Department  of \nNational  Planning,  and  Department  of  National  Budget  of  the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning. The PSC will have at least four \nrepresentatives  from  industry  and  employers,  as  well  as  two \nrotating  representatives  of  project  CoTs.  The  SDP  PIU  will \ncontinue to exist and will be responsible to the PSC for day-to-day \nproject implementation. The PIU will be led by a project director. \n \n \nADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement, \nreflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents. \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  project-financed  consulting \nservices  will  be  in  accordance  with  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  using  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. A team of consultants will provide services \nin a range of specializations, with estimated international inputs of \n99  person-months  and  domestic  inputs  of  270  person-months. \nThese  services  will  be  provided  by  a  consulting  firm  and  will  be \nselected according to ADB guidelines. \n \nThe Project will strengthen and expand the capacity for technician \nand  technological  education.  The  Project  will  raise  the  quality, \nrelevance,  and  sustainability  of  the  programs  for  technicians  and \ntechnologists  by  developing  training  and  program  standards; \nupgrading  selected  TCs  to  CoTs;  and  strengthening  the  capacity \nof TEVT teachers, trainers, personnel, and administrators.  \n \nThe  development  of  the  NVQ  for  technicians  and  technologists \nwill help institutionalize an alternative education and career path, \nparticularly  for  school  leavers,  in  technical  and  technology \neducation  leading  to  a  degree.  Establishing  a  voluntary  national \nassociation  of  TEVT  providers  and  industry  sector  councils  will \nincrease the market orientation of training programs.  \n \nreduce  high  unemployment  and \nThe  Project  will  help \nunderemployment  among  the  educated  youth,  and  increase \naccess  to  postsecondary  education  and  training  by  establishing \nUnivotec  and  CoTs,  and  by  upgrading  TCs  to  CoTs  outside \nColombo.  \n \nSocial  marketing  and  career  guidance  will  focus  on  promoting \ntechnology-based  employment,  increasing  public  awareness  of \ntechnological  career  paths,  and  marketing  training  programs  to \nwomen. The introduction of new training programs, including fields \nthat  are  not  traditionally  male-oriented,  will  attract  women  to \ntechnician programs. The new degree and diploma programs will \nbe  alternative  career  options  to  fulfill  personal  aspirations  for \nhigher  education,  particularly  for  those  who  do  not  qualify  for \nuniversity admission.  \n \nto  ensure \nCoupled  with  MSDVTE\u2019s  strengthened  capacity \nrelevance,  quality,  and  efficiency  of  TEVT, \ntechnician  and \ntechnological  education  will  create  skilled  workers  for  domestic \nindustries  and  the  foreign  labor  market.  The  direct  economic \nbenefits  are  (i)  increased  domestic  production  because  of  the \ngreater  use  of  human  capital,  which  will  be  reflected  in  wage \nincreases  of  the  graduates  employed  in  domestic  industries;  and \n(ii)  increased  remittances  in  foreign  exchange  from  graduates \nemployed abroad. \n \n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nvii\n\nin \n\ntechnical \n\nAnnual enrollment intake capacity of technician diploma programs \nis  expected  to  increase  by  about  2,400  full-time  and  part-time \nstudents.  Similarly,  Univotec  is  expected  to  have  an  annual \nenrollment intake capacity of about 600 full-time and 600 part-time \nstudents in the technologist program, and about 300 full-time and \nteacher  education \nthe \n300  part-time  students \nprogram. Over the 15-year evaluation, about 15,300 more youths \nare expected to graduate with a B.Tech. (9,900) and a B.Tech.Ed. \n(5,400) from Univotec, and about 22,500 with CoT diplomas. \n \nThe  political  conflict  is  a  major  risk  to  achieving  the  Project\u2019s \ngoals.  Without  peace  and  stability,  the  local  economy  may  not \nadvance  and  could  cause  local  demand  for  technicians  and \ntechnologists  to  stagnate.  However,  demand  for  mid-level  and \nskilled workers overseas would remain strong. \n \nThe  turnover  of  personnel  in  MSDVTE  and  its  institutions \ncontributes  to  unstable,  sometimes  weak,  TEVT  leadership  and \nadministration.  The    project  design  includes  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  officials  to  ensure  continuity  in  leadership.  Private \nsector  participation  in  various  councils  will  help  them  sustain \nTEVT programs while making training programs more relevant. \n \nAs  the  Government  provides  free  training  programs  and  small \nstipends  to  trainees,  the  sustainability  of  the  project  investment \nafter  implementation  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  provision  of \nan adequate operation and maintenance budget. The Project will \nthus  support  a  policy  dialogue  on  financially  sustaining  project \nactivities  after  implementation.  The  capacity  of  CoT  heads  for \nstrategic  planning \nrevenues  will  be \nto  generate  TEVT \nstrengthened.  \n \nThe  implementation  of  TEVT  loan  projects  suffered  from,  among \nothers,  delays  and  complex  problems  brought  about  by  the \ntransfer of project responsibility from one ministry to another, lack \nof  counterpart  funds,  and  slow  appointment  of  qualified  project \nstaff. The Government has reassured ADB that it is committed to \nthe  Project  and  will  allocate  the  necessary  counterpart  funds. \nThe SDP PIU staff may continue with the Project, minimizing the \nrisk of slow implementation. Qualified instructors and trainers are \nassumed  to  be  available.  The  Project  includes  flexible  upgrading \nof staff skills and knowledge. Government can hire temporary staff \nas  needed.  The  implementation  of  Univotec  activities  risks \ndelayed  approval,  if  not  non-approval,  of  the  University  Act  by \nParliament. The Government has reassured ADB that it is deeply \ncommitted to support the Univotec charter. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse impacts are anticipated. The Project is unlikely to trigger \nADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy.  No  adverse  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples are anticipated. \n\n \n\n\fix \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Technical  Education  Development \nProject (the Project). \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA.  \n \n2. \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  human  development  indicators  are  the  highest  in  South  Asia.  The  adult \nliteracy  rate  is  91%,  and  the  net  enrollment  rates  are  95%  in  the  primary  and  85%  in  the \nsecondary  grades.  Half  of  all  students  are  female.  However,  despite  these  significant \nachievements and having an educated and highly trainable population, the unemployment rate \namong those educated to general certificate of education (GCE) ordinary level (O/L) is 13% and \nto GCE advanced level (A/L) 17%, which are greater than the national average of 8.5%. Most \nSri  Lankans  (85%)  live  in  rural  areas.  As  of  2002,  poverty  was  more  prevalent  in  rural  areas \n(25%) and in the estates (30%) than in urban areas (8%).  \n \nOver  300,000  GCE  O/L  and  GCE  A/L  students  annually  are  not  able  to  continue  their \n3. \neducation  because  of  limited  places  in  colleges  and  universities.1  Grade-11  and  -13  school \nleavers lack the skills to get jobs or be self-employed. Students who are unable to continue to \ngrade 12 (A/L) can directly apply for admission into technical education and vocational training \n(TEVT)  programs,  such  as  craft  courses,  where  the  entry  requirement  is  GCE  O/L  pass.  With \nGCE A/L examination passes in the required subjects, students can apply to programs leading \nto national diplomas and a degree in technological education. However, GCE A/L graduates are \nless  likely  to  acquire  technical  skills  as  their  goal  is  to  acquire  traditional  university  education \nqualifications. GCE O/L graduates are more likely to go into trades and technical training. \n \n4. \nArmed  hostilities  ceased  in  2002,  increasing  political  stability  and  accelerating \nrehabilitation, reconstruction, and recovery. From negative growth in 2001, Sri Lanka posted an \nannual  average  of  5.1%  real  economic  growth  rate  in  2002\u20132004.  The  four  largest  economic \nsectors,  by  contribution  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  are  trade  and  hotels, \nmanufacturing, agriculture, and transport and communications. Over the past 6 years, the share \nof agriculture has decreased while that of transport and communications has trended up. Trade \nand services has remained steady at 25.7% and manufacturing at 17.4%, and grew faster than \nthe  general  economy  in  2003\u20132004.  Sri  Lanka  receives  significant  income  in  the  form  of \nremittances from Sri Lankans working as expatriate workers\u20147.5% of GDP in 2004.  \n \nAs the share of agriculture shrinks, available jobs are declining and pressure is mounting \n5. \nto create jobs in other domestic sectors, which require higher skills. However, labor market data \nand projections point to short supply of technicians and associate professionals. Projections for \n2006\u20132007  indicate  a  total  shortfall  of  over  14,000  positions  in  manufacturing,  construction, \ntransport and communications, and other sectors. Abroad, competition between Sri Lankan and \ndomestic workers seems to be fierce. At the same time, Sri Lanka is unable to fill job orders for \nmid-level and highly skilled (and higher-wage) worker categories, whose share of the job orders \nis increasing. In 2003 alone, of the job orders for 20,980 skilled positions, only 8,987 were filled. \n\n                                                 \n1  In 2001, of the 456,829 who sat for O/L examinations, about 273,000 (60%) did not qualify to continue on to A/L \neducation. Of the 198,509 candidates who sat for the A/L examinations, 98,329 (50%) qualified for university, but \nonly 11,962 were admitted; thus, 186,547 of the A/L candidates could not proceed to university. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAbout 1 million Sri Lankans, or 15% of the employed, are abroad, most of whom are working as \nunskilled and semiskilled workers, particularly as housemaids. \n \n6. \nThe  Government  is  responding  to  unemployment  and  the  changing  labor  market  by \ncombining  short-  and  medium-term  strategies.  In  the  short  term,  the  Government  is  exploring \nthe possibility of expanding skilled and semi-skilled foreign employment while, over the medium \nterm, according high priority to manufacturing-based growth with increased foreign investment. \nThis strategy requires highly trained labor, including technicians and technologists, who are in \nshort supply.  \n \nB.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nTo  meet  the  need  for  technicians  and  technologists  and  for  higher  education,  TEVT, \nparticularly  technician  and  technological  education  programs,  needs  to  be  more  accessible. \nPrograms  need  to  be  of  better  quality,  more  relevant,  and  more  sustainable,  and  their  social \nimage must be enhanced. The TEVT sector analysis is in Appendix 1.  \n \nProvision  of  Technical  and  Technological  Education.  Postsecondary  technical  and \n8. \ntechnological  education  is  relatively  underdeveloped.  The  large  investments  needed  to  put  up \nsuch  facilities  hinder  the  establishment  of  more  institutions,  both  public  and  private.  Diploma \nprograms  cater  to  those  who  have  GCE  A/L  qualifications,  with  good  marks  in  mathematics, \nphysics,  and  chemistry.  These  programs  are  3\u20134  years  long,  including  on-the-job  training. \nDiploma  programs  in  technical  and  technological  education  are  conducted  by  at  least  four \nrecognized institutions, all clustered in Colombo and not accessible to many potential student-\ntrainees. These programs are funded by the Government and include nominal daily allowances \nto  students.  Although  training  institutions  outside  Colombo  do  not  offer  technician-  and \ntechnology-related diploma programs, some technical colleges (TCs) can be upgraded to do so. \nThere are 37 TCs throughout the country\u2019s nine provinces. \n \n9. \nExcluding the Open University of Sri Lanka, institutions offering technician programs in \n2003  took  in  about  700  students-trainees  and  graduated  563  technicians.  The  technologist \nprogram is offered by the university and, in 2002 and 2003, took in a total of 522 students and \ngraduated  29.  The  numbers  of  graduates  are  much  lower  than  the  local  labor  market \nrequirements  for  technicians  and  higher-level  skills,  not  to  mention  overseas  demand  for \ntechnicians.  The  training  output  for  higher-level  technical  skills  is  disproportionately  low \ncompared to the enrollment in craft and operator courses, or a ratio of about 1:50 to craft skills, \nwhich is far from the normal proportion (1:5 to 1:10). Capacity to develop higher-level technical \nskills  is  low  and  cannot  respond  to  private  sector  requirements  and  global  competition.  \nThe development and promotion of the technical education system must be accelerated. \n \nTechnician  Standards  and  Quality  Assurance  Mechanisms.  There  are  no \n10. \noperational  program  standards  for  technicians  that  can  be  used  as  curriculum  bases  in  TEVT \ninstitutions;  there  are  also  no  institutional  standards  for  TEVT  institutions,  private  or  public. \nLevels 5\u20137 of the national vocational qualifications (NVQ) framework are yet to be developed. \nQuality assurance mechanisms for the technician and technologist programs need to be put in \nplace. Although there is a registration system for training providers, it requires refinement and \nwider  implementation.  The  Tertiary  and  Vocational  Education  Commission  (TVEC),  which  is \nmandated to provide quality assurance to the TEVT system, needs to be strengthened in audit \nof programs and institutions to ensure that they comply with TEVT accreditation standards.  \n \n11.  When  they  complete  their  training,  trainees  should  be  able  to  find  jobs.  Training \nprograms should be relevant, responding to the needs of the industry and employers. However, \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nduring  project  preparation,  employers  and  their  associations  were  dissatisfied  with  TEVT  at \nmost  levels.  Industry  and  employers  must  be  closely  involved  in  identifying  training  program \nofferings, setting program standards, validating curricula, and making other decisions relating to \nTEVT. This would raise their interest in recruiting graduates from government TEVT institutions. \nHeads  of  training  institutions  should  undertake  strategic  planning  and  management  and \ncollaborate more with industry and employers to make programs more responsive to the market. \nGovernment  regulations  affecting  the  decision  making  of  upgraded  training  institutions  should \nbe reviewed, to identify responsibilities that can be decentralized.  \n \nNumber  and  Qualifications  of  Teaching  Personnel.  Overall,  teaching  personnel  are \n12. \nneither  sufficient  in  number  nor  sufficiently  qualified,  particularly  for  technician  programs.  \nIn  2002,  only  62%  of  the  allocated  posts  in  the  four  major  TEVT  providers  were  filled,  mainly \nbecause of the hiring freeze in the Government. Visiting or part-time staff are hired to augment \nacademic  staff.  The  student\u2013teacher  ratio  based  on  enrollment  is  about  32:1,  which  needs  to \ndecrease to improve quality.2 A recent study conducted by TVEC3 on the training staff in major \npublic  providers,  including  TCs,  revealed  that  about  79%  of  staff  members  have  a  diploma  or \nlower  and  possess  mainly  a  6-months  technical  certificate  or  a  2-year  technical  diploma.  Half \nhad  teacher  training  of  less  than  3  weeks  and  about  36%  had  no  pedagogical  training.  Only \n13%  had  industrial  training  after  joining  the  public  service.  Most  teachers  lack  trade  skills  and \nindustrial experience, methods and psychology of learning, student assessment and evaluation \nmethodologies,  and  teaching  practicum.  The  facilities  for  technical  teacher  training  are  limited \nand  are  only  in  Colombo.  No  institution  addresses  preservice  education  of  TEVT  teachers.  \nNo  degree  programs  raise  the  qualifications  of  technical  teachers  to  the  professional  level  to \naddress the lack of teaching skills, the need to upgrade technical knowledge, and the need to \nimprove  qualifications  for  higher  pay.  In  mid-2005,  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  mass \nrecruitment,  MSDVTE  recruited  degree  holders,  some  of  whom  will  be  instructors  in  training \nprograms, helping fill posts, but many require pedagogical training. Recruitment and retention of \nteachers  and  instructors  is  hampered  by  low  pay,  which  is  aggravated  by  the  lack  of \nopportunities to improve qualifications. \n  \n13. \nFinancial  Sustainability.  As  the  Government  provides  free  training,  expanding  TEVT \nthrough new technician and technologist programs will require more money. A strategy should \nensure that training programs receive adequate resources, run efficiently, and are conducted in \na  sustainable  manner.  Resources  should  be  linked  to  outputs  to  ensure  that  the  quality  of \ntraining programs and trainees is not compromised and that TEVT investments in facilities and \nequipment  are  not  wasted.  More  resources  are  needed  to  purchase  consumable  training \nmaterials; run, maintain, and repair training equipment; and procure learning materials.  \n \n14. \nNo  Alternative  Paths  to  Higher  Education.  The  problem  of  upgrading  teachers\u2019 \nknowledge and qualifications is aggravated by the absence of options for upward mobility within \nthe TEVT system, hampering its potential to create jobs, build skill-based competitiveness and \nhuman  capital,  and  attract  and  develop  students  with  vocational  aptitude  and  the  appropriate \nattitude.  The  capacities  of  conventional  universities  are  limited  and  mostly  oriented  toward \nacademic  pursuits  leading  to  white-collar  jobs.  In  general,  there  is  no  systematic  link  between \nTEVT  and  the  higher  education  system  for  vertical  mobility  toward  life-long  learning  and \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 1999.

The study had 1,774 respondents. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nalternative  career  paths.  The  adoption  by  the  Government  of  the  NVQ  framework4  in  TEVT \nallows O/L and A/L students to pursue technical-oriented careers and receive higher education \nwhile  employed.  The  NVQ  classifies  TEVT  courses  according  to  skills  standards;  the  NVQ\u2019s \napex  is  the  achievement  of  a  degree  by  an  O/L  student.  Appendix  2  summarizes  the  NVQ \nframework.  \n \n15. \nSocial  Image.  TEVT  has  a  poor  social  image.  As  potential  applicants  into  the  current \ntechnician training system have completed GCE A/L, most are qualified for university admission. \nTechnician  training  in  whatever  form  under  the  current  system  does  not  lead  to  a  degree.  \nThe demand for degrees is high, which is unlikely to be filled by the current university system. \nDuring  project  preparation,  discussions  with  students  focused  on  degrees  and  not  on \ntechnology or work. GCE O/L students, however, are not eligible for diploma studies and are not \ninformed  of  their  alternatives.  Families  need  to  know  the  economic  opportunities  awaiting \ntechnicians.  To  attract  more  women  to  training  programs  that  will  allow  them  to  earn  higher \nincomes,  the  attitude  toward  female  participation  in  the  technician  profession  needs  to  be \nimproved.  \n \n16. \nGovernment  Strategy.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  skills  and \nadopt  international  best  practices  to  increase  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  competitiveness  and  improve  the \nemployability  of  its  workforce  locally  and  abroad.  The  Government  has  planned  to  strengthen \nthe  intake  and  output  of  education  and  TEVT  institutions.  To  upgrade  TEVT  personnel\u2019s \nknowledge and skills, and to provide alternative higher education, the Government is planning to \n(i)  upgrade  one  TC  in  each  of  the  nine  provinces  to  a  college  of  technology  (CoT),  which  will \noffer  technician  diploma  programs;  and  (ii)  develop  an  alternative  higher  education  pathway, \nfocusing  on  technical  education  and  technology,  by  establishing  the  University  of  Vocational \nTechnology (Univotec), which will be the apex TEVT institution in the country. \n \nADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s education and training strategy in Sri Lanka5 is consistent with the \n17. \nGovernment\u2019s  priorities.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  supports  the  development  of  TEVT  to  reduce \nhigh  youth  unemployment  and  develop  high-level  human  resources  to  achieve  skill-based \ncompetitiveness.  ADB  supports  the  improvement  of  relevance,  effectiveness,  and  efficiency  of \nthe technical and skilled workforce. \n \n18. \nExternal  Assistance.  ADB  is  one  of  the  largest  providers  of  external  assistance  to \neducation and training, with investments of about $233 million in eight projects over the past 23 \nyears.  Three  of  the  projects  were  for  technical  education  and  skill  development  (Appendix  3). \nThey  were  designed  to  address  problems  confronting  TEVT  and  have  helped  build  and \nstrengthen  TEVT  capacity  to  serve  expanding  training  requirements.  Past  projects  developed \nstandards  and  training  programs,  built  capacity  of  training-teaching  staff  and  administrators, \nestablished technical teacher training facilities, and updated training facilities and equipment.  \n \n19. \nDevelopment  partners  have  committed  to  upgrade  four  CoTs  and  develop  Univotec.  \nTC-Jaffna will be upgraded by the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), and three \ntechnologies will be upgraded in TC-Maradana by the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA),  while  one  CoT  each  in  the  Eastern  and  Southern  provinces  will  be  confirmed  for \nassistance  by  other  development  partners.  Univotec  will  receive  assistance  from  the  German \nTechnical Cooperation (GTZ) in applied advanced technologies. \n                                                 \n4  NVQ  framework  development  was  one  of  the  activities  of  the  ongoing  Skills  Development  Project;  ADB.  1999. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Skills Development Project.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \nLessons Learned. ADB\u2019s assistance to TEVT started in 1982. Two projects6 have been \n20. \ncompleted while the Skills Development Project (SDP) is ongoing; the proposed Project is the \nfourth  TEVT  project.  Appendix  4  summarizes  lessons  learned  from  TEVT  projects  in  other \ncountries and in Sri Lanka, which have been incorporated in the proposed project design.7 While \nthe SDP supports programs in vocational training, the lower half of the qualifications framework, \nthe Project will assist the upper half. The Project builds on the NVQ framework developed with \nthe SDP\u2019s support. To ensure the relevance of training programs, project preparation included \nconsultations  with  industries  in  different  regions  to  identify  their  current  and  emerging  needs. \nThe  Project  proposes  to  develop  the  technician  programs  with  industry  and  employer  input  to \nensure  that  relevant  skills  and  knowledge  are  imparted.  As  the  Government  provides  free \neducation and training until the first degree, and fee-levying is a sensitive issue, charging fees \nfrom students and trainees will not necessarily be the first recourse for financial sustainability. \nThe Project will review the regulations of the Government; of the Ministry of Skills Development, \nVocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE); and of the Department of Technical Education \nand Training (DTET) to identify which responsibilities can be decentralized to help make training \nprograms  more  efficient  and  sustainable.  The  Project  will  train  senior  personnel  of  CoTs  in \nstrategic  planning,  industry  partnerships,  and  training  needs  assessments,  and  develop  and \nimplement output-based budgeting (OBB) for CoTs.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe Project\u2019s impact will be the development of more mid-level and highly skilled human \nresources who will contribute to economic growth and social development. The Project supports \nthe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  economic  goals  by  improving  the  country\u2019s \nskill-based competitiveness. \n \n22. \nThe Project\u2019s envisioned outcome is improved access and strengthened capacity of the \nTEVT system in technical and technological education to meet labor market needs. The Project \nwill help the Government close the gap between the supply of and demand for technicians and \ntechnologists by helping (i) upgrade TCs to CoTs to offer new technician diploma programs, and \n(ii) establish Univotec to offer new technical education and technology degree programs.  \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe Project will have three outputs: (i) CoTs strengthened to offer technician education, \n(ii)  MSDVTE  and  relevant  institutions  strengthened  to  support  market-responsive  TEVT,  and  \n(iii)  Univotec  established  and  made  operational.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n24. \nThe  Project  complements  and  builds  on  the  SDP  outputs.  The  Project  will  develop  the \nNVQ  framework  by  adding  the  program  standards  of  NVQ  levels  5\u20137  (technician  to \ntechnologist) to the SDP-initiated skills standards of levels 1\u20134. The Project will involve industry \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n6    ADB. 1982.

The  proposed  education  and  training  pathway  to  technician \ndiplomas is illustrated in Appendix 6. CoTs will have delegated authorities and, as the flagship \nTEVT  center  in  its  province,  provide  technical support  to  the  smaller  TCs  with  less  resources. \nTraining  programs  will  primarily  meet  domestic  labor  market  needs  and,  secondarily,  foreign \ndemand.  The  Project  will  help  upgrade  six  CoTs  (project  CoTs),  namely,  Anuradhapura  CoT, \nBadulla CoT, Kandy CoT, Kurunegala CoT, Maradana CoT, and Rathnapura CoT. Development \npartners will help upgrade three CoTs in the three other provinces. The annual enrollment intake \ncapacity of technician diploma programs is expected to increase from the current 600 students \nto about 1,500 full-time and 1,500 part-time students; the additional students will not be required \nto have GCE A/L qualifications for admission.  \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Administration and Operations Systems \n\n \n26. \nTo  improve  the  operational  efficiency  of  CoTs,  the  Project  will  help  develop  and  install \nsystems  and  procedures,  including  related  manuals  and  handbooks,  on  governance  and \nadministration,  planning,  monitoring,  and  management  and  information  systems  according  to \nthe  institutions\u2019  vision  and  goals.  The  systems  and  procedures  will  cover  budgeting,  student \nregistration,  and  alumni  registration.  The  Project  will  train  about  24  nonacademic  and \nadministrative staff in these systems and procedures and in budgeting, planning, and financial \nmanagement.  CoTs  are  expected  to  develop,  among  others,  their  own  annual  budgets, \ncalculate  their  unit  costs,  and  eventually  implement  OBB.  The  Project  will  provide  the  project \nCoTs with consultancies; training and workshops; and procurement of equipment, software, and \nmaterials. \n \n \n\nStrengthening Strategic Management  \n\nb. \n\n \n\n \n27. \nThe objective of this subcomponent is to strengthen the capacity of each CoT to develop \nand  implement  strategic  plans  in  response  to  the  needs  of  employers,  the  manufacturing  and \nservices sectors, industry, and the region it is serving. Advisory councils will be established for \neach  CoT  and  will  have  at  least  60%  representation  from  employers,  the  manufacturing  and \nservice sectors, and industry. The Project will orient members of advisory councils in strategic \nplanning  for  TEVT.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  about  18  CoTs  officials  to \nundertake strategic planning, business development, and entrepreneurial management, to serve \neconomic and investment needs and priorities, in close consultation with regional development \nbodies  and  businesses.  The  training  will  include  (i)  management  and  planning  for  a  market-\nresponsive institution, (ii) development and promotion of demand-driven part-time education and \ntraining  programs,  (iii)  training  needs  assessment  in  industries  and  communities,  (iv)  building \npartnerships  with  employers  for  training,  exploring  subcontracted  production  to  enhance \ntraining,  and  (v)  writing  project  proposals  and  bidding  documents.  The  Project  will  provide  for \nconsultancy  and  study  tours  to  model  institutions  abroad  for  international  benchmarking  and \nnetworking. \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\nc. \n\nDeveloping Student Selection Procedures and New Curricula \n\n \n28. \nCoTs  will  be  offering  new  technician  diploma  programs  within  the  NVQ  framework. \nThese programs will not require GCE A/L passes for admission; thus, students may come from \ndiverse  academic  and  training  backgrounds.  The  Project  will  help  develop  a  student  selection \nsystem  that  will  consider  the  varied  backgrounds  of  applicants.  This  will  include  identifying \nknowledge gaps and recommending bridging programs to be offered by CoTs and other training \nproviders. The system will include a technician aptitude test, which the Project will develop and \nvalidate.  The  Project  will  provide  consultancies,  training  and  workshops,  equipment,  and \nmaterials.  \n \n29. \nThe Project will help develop 12 new technician program curricula according to TVEC-\napproved  standards  and  the  NVQ  framework.  The  indicative  list  of  technologies  in  which \ntechnician programs may be offered includes biomedicine, ceramics and clay, civil technology, \nelectricity  and  power,  electronics  and  communication,  electronic  imaging  and  printing,  farm \nmachinery, food technology, information and communication, jewelry design and manufacturing, \nmarine  technology,  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning,  and  welding  and  fabrication.  Appropriate \nbenchmarked  curricula  from  the  international  technician  training  market  will  be  identified  and \nacquired; where necessary, curricula will be developed according to program standards. Three \nbridging  programs  will  be  developed.  The  Project  will  establish  sectoral  councils  to  validate \ntechnician  curricula.  A  system  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  programs  and \nstudents  will  be  developed.  The  Project  will  provide  for  consultancies,  the  development  and \nacquisition of curricula, learning and multimedia materials, software, and office equipment. \n \nTraining  partnerships  with  industries  may  involve  the  development  of  part-time  and \n30. \nmodular  training  programs  for  employees  and  managers  to  upgrade  their  skills  and \nqualifications.  Part-time  courses  will  be  an \nfor  TEVT.  \nIn collaboration with industries, the Project will help develop training modules of varying duration \nto be offered as fee-charging part-time courses.  \n \n\nimportant  source  of  revenue \n\n \n\nd. \n\nUpgrading Facilities and Equipment \n\n \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  the  procurement  and  installation  of  equipment  in  project \n31. \nCoTs  that  will  match  the  curricular  requirements  of  technician  programs  and  meet  TVEC-\nendorsed skill and program standards. The programs\u2019 equipment needs will be reviewed vis-\u00e0-\nvis  the  equipment  stock  of  these  institutions,  after  which  a  list  of  necessary  curricular  training \nequipment will be prepared. Equipment will be of the generic type approved by industry sector \ncouncils  (ISCs).  A  facilities  and  equipment  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  plan  will  be \ndeveloped.  Teaching  and  technical  staff  will  be  trained  in  O&M  of  equipment  and  facilities  in \nproject CoTs.  \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  renovation  of  physical  facilities  of  each  project  CoT.  \nA  physical  facilities  development  plan  will  be  developed.  It  will  identify  minor  facilities \nrenovations,  if  any,  needed  to  provide  technician  training  as  per  the  endorsed  standards, \ncurricula developed to meet those standards, and equipment purchased to support the curricula. \nThe  Project  will  support  these  renovations,  which  will  be  minor  and  may  cover  workshops, \nlaboratories, offices, electrical power, water supply, and lighting.  \n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nUpgrading the Skills of Teaching Personnel  \n\n \n33. \nThe qualifications, knowledge, and skills of CoTs teaching personnel will be upgraded to \nteach  new  curricula  in  the  context  of  any  new  equipment  acquired  or  new  training  program \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nareas  offered.  The  Project  will  provide  consultancies  and  financial  resources  to  prepare  and \nimplement  a  staff  development  plan.  The  Project  will  support  upgrading  of  (i)  educational \nqualifications  of  teaching  and  training  staff  and  (ii)  technical  and  industrial  skills  of  technical \nteachers  in  existing  and  new  technologies.  Activity  (i)  will  include  upgrading  educational \nqualifications  to  a  bachelor  of  technical  education  (B.Tech.Ed.)  or  its  equivalent,  including \nthrough in-service training at Univotec. If the establishment of Univotec is delayed, students will \nenroll in flexibly-delivered programs in other institutions.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nComponent 2: Strengthening MSDVTE and Relevant Institutions \n\n \n34. \nThe Project will strengthen MSDVTE and relevant institutions to facilitate, support, and \nensure  a  relevant,  quality,  and  sustainable  TEVT  system,  with  focus  on  NVQ  levels  5\u20137.  \nThe  Project  will  consolidate  the  progress  made  under  the  SDP  and  build  on  its  completed \nactivities.  This  component  will  include  (i)  the  development  and  implementation  of  OBB,  \n(ii)  a  refined  education  management  information  system  (EMIS),  (iii)  training  standards  for \nhigher-level  technical  skills,  an  operational  NVQ  system,  (iv)  a  quality  assurance  system,  and \n(v) a TEVT social marketing strategy. \n \n\na. \n\nDeveloping Output-Based Budgeting \n\n \nOBB  will  link  institutions\u2019  resources  and  outputs,  which  will  help  improve  the  use  of \n35. \nfacilities and equipment, and thus increase the cost-effectiveness of programs. The Project will \nhelp develop OBB for MSDVTE training institutions. Training workshops on OBB will be offered \nto MSDVTE planning, budgeting, and accounting personnel, and to related staff of the Ministry \nof  Finance  and  Planning.  The  Project  will  support  consultancies,  training  and  workshops, \nsoftware, materials, and office equipment in relevant offices. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening TEVT Sector Policy Analysis and Planning  \n\n \n36. \nThe Project will refine MSDVTE\u2019s EMIS to include information on the CoTs and Univotec \nand on the OBB requirements. The refined EMIS will be installed at MSDVTE, TVEC, Univotec, \nand  CoTs.  The  Project  will  help  MSDVTE  comprehensively  map  government  and \nnongovernment TEVT institutions using a geographic information system (GIS). The Project will \ntrain about 12 staff members of MSDVTE, TVEC, Univotec, and CoTs in the use of EMIS and \nGIS data for policy analysis, planning, and decision making.  \n \nThe Project will help TVEC conduct and disseminate information and  studies on TEVT \n37. \nissues  and  policies.  The  studies\u2019  topics  include  (i)  mechanisms  to  ensure  the  financial \nsustainability  of  relevant  quality  training  programs,  (ii)  the  efficiency  of  the  present  system  of \nGovernment  and  nongovernment  TEVT  provision,  (iii)  the  administrative  and  regulatory \nenvironment  of  private  TEVT  provision,  (iv)  quantification  of  economic  benefits  contributed  by \nthe  TEVT  sector,  and  (v)  employment  of  trainees  and  tracer  studies.  Under  (i),  specific \nrecommendations will be made, some of which will be piloted in project CoTs. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  consultancies,  training,  consultation  workshops,  research \n38. \nassistance,  software,  computers,  reproduction  of  study  papers  and  reports,  web  page \ndevelopment and maintenance, and workshops to inform policy makers and the public of TEVT \nissues.  \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nc. \n\nDeveloping the NVQ and Program Standards  \nfor Technologists and Technicians  \n\n \n39. \nThe Project will support the continued articulation of the NVQ, with focus on the higher-\nlevel  qualifications  for  technicians  and  technologists.  The  related  program  standards  and \nsample curricula for NVQ levels 5\u20137 will be developed. TVEC will be assisted to establish ISCs, \nwhich will adapt and validate international and locally developed training standards in selected \ntechnology and crafts programs. ISCs will provide guidance on the estimated human resource \nrequirements of sectors. The Project will develop at least 12 technician and technology program \nstandards  in  new  and  emerging  technologies.  These  standards  will  provide  for  horizontal  and \nvertical mobility in TEVT. The related skills standards of these technologies at NVQ levels 1\u20134 \nwill be reviewed, and refined as needed, for seamless progression to levels 5\u20137. About 30 skills \nstandards will be developed and validated at levels 1\u20134. The Project will help disseminate these \nstandards  to  stakeholders,  including  Government  and  nongovernment  training  providers.  \nThe Project will support consultancies, workshops, materials, reproduction, and dissemination.  \n\n \n \n\nd. \n\nStrengthening the TEVT Quality Assurance System \n\n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  develop  and  implement  a  TEVT  quality  assurance  mechanism  for \ntechnician  and  technological  education  programs  to  ensure  that  ISC-validated  program \nstandards  endorsed  by  TVEC  are  achieved  and  maintained  by  all  training  providers.  TVEC \nregistration  procedures  and  standards  for  nongovernment  training  providers  will  be  reviewed \nand  refined  as  needed  by  the  Project.  Accreditation  standards  and  transparent  accreditation \nprocedures  will  be  developed  and  implemented.  Database  systems  for  registration  and \naccreditation  will  be  developed  and  installed.  To  assist  the  accreditation  process,  and  also \nfacilitate  government\u2013private  training  provider  interactions,  TEVT  providers  will  be  organized \ninto  a  national  association.  About  15  TVEC  staff  members  and  40  prospective  accreditation \nauditors,  including  members  of  the  association  of  training  providers  and  professional \norganizations, will be trained in the accreditation process. The Project will help TVEC undertake \nsample compliance audits. The Project will provide for 10 institutional audits in the first year of \nthe  program,  15  in  the  second  year,  and  25  in  the  third  year.  The  Project  will  support \nconsultancies,  workshops,  materials,  software,  office  equipment, \nreproduction,  and \ndissemination.  \n \n\ne. \n\nEnhancing the Social Image of TEVT \n\n \nDiploma programs will require social marketing to attract workers, students, and school \n41. \nleavers, particularly women, with the aptitude and attitude for technical and vocational education \nand a career in technology. The Project will raise the public\u2019s awareness of the NVQ framework \nand  technical  education.  In  collaboration  with  national  industry  sector  associations,  career \nguidance and counseling units, and JobsNet,8 the Project will develop and implement a social \nmarketing  strategy.  The  strategy  will  include  information  to  be  disseminated  through  mass \nmedia,  in  the  JobsNet  system,  and  in  the  career  centers  established  through  the  SDP.  \nThe Project will support consultancies; material development, procurement, and dissemination; \nand mass media campaigns.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n8   JobsNet is an initiative of the Ministry of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment that is being managed by the \nCeylon Chamber of Commerce. JobsNet does not only provide information on available employment opportunities, \nbut also an interface for employers and job-seekers. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nComponent 3: Establishing the University of Vocational Technology  \n\n3. \n \n42. \nUpon  the  passage  of  the  University  of  Vocational  Technology  Act  (Univotec  Act),  \nthe  Project  will  help  the  Government  establish  Univotec,  which  will  address  the  shortage  of \ntechnologists and qualified instructors for technical education, and provide an alternative higher \neducation pathway leading to a degree for students and TEVT personnel. By providing access \nto  tertiary  education,  this  component  will  help  improve  the  sector\u2019s  social  image.  Univotec  will \noffer new degree programs, starting with a B.Tech.Ed. and a bachelor of technology (B.Tech.). \nIt  will  have  various  campuses  using  the  physical  facilities  of  various  TEVT  institutions.  \nThe  premises  of  the  National  Institute  of  Technical  Education  of  Sri  Lanka  (NITESL)  will  be \nupgraded  to  be  the  main  campus,  and  NITESL  will  be  strengthened  to  become  a  faculty  of \ntraining  technology.  Other  technical  institutions  of  MSDVTE,  including  TC-Ratmalana,  will \nbecome  part  of  the  faculty  of  vocational  technology.  Univotec  is  expected  to  have  an  annual \nenrollment intake capacity of about 600 full-time and 600 part-time students in the technologist \nprogram, and about 300 full-time and 300 part-time students in the technical teacher education \nprogram. \n \n\na. \n\nDeveloping University Administration and Technical Capacity \n\n \n43. \nThe Project will support the development and implementation of university systems and \nprocedures,  including  manuals  and  handbooks,  on  university  governance  and  administration, \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  management  and  information  systems.  The  latter  will  include  \n(i)  student  administration,  (ii)  human  resource  management,  (iii)  budgeting  and  finance,  and  \n(iv) alumni tracing. This will be achieved by consultancies; procurement of equipment, software, \nand  materials;  and  training  and  workshops.  The  Project  will  train  about  15  Univotec  staff \nmembers to use these systems.  \n \n44. \nTo develop the capacity of Univotec officials in university leadership and administration, \nthe  Project  will  support  up  to  22  officials  for  executive  leadership  training  and  regional  and \noverseas  study  tours  of  similar  institutions  for  international  benchmarking  and  development  of \nuniversity  linkages.  About  60  academic  and  technical  staff  members  will  train  in  emerging  or \nnew technologies to be offered at the diploma and degree levels, teacher education, curriculum \nand  multimedia  material  development,  appropriate  nontraditional  content  delivery  modes,  and \napplied  research  and  extension.  The  Project  will  provide  consultancies,  international  and  local \ntraining, workshops, and materials.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDeveloping Student Selection Procedures and New Curricula  \n\n \n45. \nThe Project will help develop curricula in degree programs leading to a B.Tech.Ed. and  \na  B.Tech.,  and  develop  and  acquire  related  curriculum  materials,  including  multimedia.  \nThe  Project  will  help  develop  and  validate  student  admission  and  selection  standards  and \nrequirements,  which  consider  the  varied  academic  and  training  backgrounds  of  applicants.  \nThis  will  include  assessment  of  various  diploma  programs,  identification  of  academic  and \ntraining gaps, and recommendations for bridging programs to be offered by diploma institutions \nand  Univotec.  The  Project  will  help  develop  bridging  programs  for  Univotec.  To  achieve  all \nthese, the Project will provide consultancies, workshops, and curricular and learning materials. \n \n \n \n46.  With  new  programs  to  be  conducted  and  more  students  and  trainees  to  be  served, \nadditional facilities and equipment will be required. The Project will support a consultant who will \ndevelop  a  rational  phased  infrastructure  development  plan  for  the  university,  considering  the \n\nUpgrading Facilities and Equipment \n\nc. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nSpecial Features  \n\navailable  infrastructure and  facilities  of  MSDVTE  institutions  that  could  be  used  as  campuses. \nThe  plan  will  identify  facility  gaps  and  develop  the  master  plan  and  architectural  drawings  of \nessential infrastructure based on approved resources for this purpose. The Project will support \nthe  upgrade  and  construction,  if  necessary,  of  classrooms,  light  and  heavy  laboratories, \nworkshops,  and  communal  and  administrative  accommodations.  New  equipment  and  furniture \nwill  be  provided  based  on  the  set  minimum  standards  of  the  new  curricular  programs  and \ntechnology  specializations.  Office,  communication,  and  reprographic  equipment  will  be \nprocured.  A  facilities  and  equipment  O&M  manual  will  be  developed.  About  24  academic  and \ntechnical staff members will be trained in O&M of these equipment and facilities.  \n \nC. \n \nAdmission  Eligibility  of  GCE  O/L-Educated  Youth  and  Employed  Workers.  \n47. \nThe  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to  GCE  O/L-educated  youth  and  employed  workers,  \nwho have satisfactorily completed and been awarded a national certificate or its equivalent, to \nbe admitted to a diploma program upon meeting some equivalency requirements. \n \n48. \nLaddered  Training  System  with  an  Alternative  Pathway  to  Diploma  and  Degree \nPrograms.  The  Project  supports  a  laddered  training  system  for  vertical  progression  and \ncontinuing  education  of  technical  and  technician  graduates.  This  opens  options  to  link  and \narticulate  the  TEVT  programs  with  technology  and  technical  education  to  the  degree  level.  \nThis  will  be  made  possible  by  using  established  standards  to  develop  bridging  modules  to \ncompensate for content deficiencies. Univotec will provide an alternative pathway to a degree, \nimprove access to tertiary education, and provide vertical mobility within TEVT. \n \nD.  \n \n49. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $26.7  million  equivalent,  including  taxes, \nduties,  interest  charges  on  the  ADB  loan,  and  physical  and  price  contingencies.  The  foreign \nexchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $9.9  million  (37%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  at  $16.8  million \n(63%) equivalent of the total cost.

MSDVTE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be \norganized  to  direct  the  Project,  monitor  its  activities  and  outputs,  guide  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU),  and  coordinate  and  liaise  with  other  government  agencies  and \ndepartments.  The  secretary  of  MSDVTE  will  chair  the  PSC,  whose  members  will  comprise \nrepresentatives  from  TVEC;  Ceylon-German  Technical  Training  Institute;  DTET;  National \nApprentice  and  Industrial  Training  Authority;  NITESL;  Vocational  Training  Authority;  Univotec; \nMinistry  of  Education  with  responsibility  for  higher  education;  and  External  Resources \nDepartment,  Department  of  National  Planning,  and  Department  of  National  Budget  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Planning.  The  PSC  will  include  at  least  four  representatives  from \nindustry and employers, as well as two rotating representatives of project CoTs. The PSC will \nmeet as needed but not less than quarterly to review project progress and to make decisions. \nThe MSDVTE policy working group will provide TEVT policy guidance and technical advice to \nthe PIU, and ensure the continuity and consistency of reforms and changes to TEVT policy and \nMSDVTE institutions. The project director will be a member and the PSC secretary. \n \n52. \nThe  SDP  PIU  will  be  retained  to  ensure  continuity  between  the  SDP  and  the  Project. \nIt will be responsible to the PSC for day-to-day project implementation and will be headed by a \nproject director. Specialists in administration and finance, procurement, civil works, and project \nperformance  monitoring  and  reporting  will  assist  the  project  director.  Focal  persons  will  be \nappointed in each project CoT and institution receiving project support and implementing project \nactivities. The PIU will coordinate with DTET in implementing component 1, and with TVEC and \nthe MSDVTE planning division for component 2. While the Univotec Act is awaiting passage by \nParliament,  the  MSDVTE  planning  division  will  coordinate  component  3;  after  passage  of  the \nact, Univotec will take over. To ensure the smooth implementation of project activities in each \nproject CoT, the CoT head will be appointed as the focal person and will be responsible to the \nPSC and PIU for project implementation in that CoT.  \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n \n53. \nThe indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement   \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  March  2006  to  February  2011.  \n\n \n54. \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  contract  for goods  and  services  of  more  than  $500,000  will \nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  contract \npackages of $500,000 equivalent or less will follow international shopping procedures. All civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  awarded  through  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified \ncontractors  in  accordance  with  Government  standard  procedures  and  other  requirements \nsatisfactory to ADB. Minor items valued at less than $50,000 equivalent will be procured directly \nfollowing  Government  procedures.  Appendix  9  includes  the  indicative  procurement  packages \nand modes of procurement. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \n55. \nProject will be in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  team  of  consultants  to \nprovide services in a range of specializations, with estimated international inputs of 99 person-\nmonths  and  domestic  inputs  of  270  person-months,  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Appendix  10  summarizes  the  required  consulting \nservices, and Appendix 11 provides the outline terms of reference. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \n56. \nand  MSDVTE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nStaff Development and Training \n\n \nInternational  fellowships  and  local  training  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  about \n57. \n1,022  people,  equivalent  to  4,475  person-months  of  training:  226  person-months  for \ninternational fellowships and 4,249 person-months for local training and industrial attachments. \nSelection of candidates will follow the Government\u2019s policy and implementing guidelines under \nforeign  and  local  training.  ADB  approval  will  be  required  before  the  award  of  international \nfellowships.  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of  (i)  the  nominated  candidates,  (ii)  their \nqualifications,  and  (iii)  detailed  cost  of  proposed  courses.  For  training  recipients,  a  bonding \narrangement, in accordance with Government procedures and requiring recipients to remain in \ntheir  institutions  for  a  minimum  period,  will  be  required.  A  summary  of  indicative  areas  for \ninternational staff development and local staff training is in Appendix 12. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n58.  MSDVTE will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections and for requesting \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  To  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  funds,  an \nimprest  account  will  be  established  in  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  in  Colombo.  The  initial \namount  will  be  no  more  than  a  6-months  projected  disbursement  or  10%  of  the  total  loan \namount, whichever is less. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed \nor liquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. MSDVTE will \ncoordinate  the  timely  release  of  funds.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the \nimprest  account  and  SOE  procedures.  A  separate  audit  opinion  should  be  included  in  the \nannual audit report. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n \n59. \nThe Government, acting through MSDVTE, will maintain records and accounts adequate \nto identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. MSDVTE will maintain separate \nrecords  and  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial  statements  are \naudited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor\u2019s report and \ncopies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion \non the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and use of the imprest account \nunder ADB\u2019s SOE procedure, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after \nthe  close  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  year.  The  independent  external  auditing  services  will  be \nfinanced from the loan proceeds.  \n \nThe  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  status  and  progress  of  project \n60. \nimplementation and submit them to ADB within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will have \na  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  indicate  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  \n(ii)  status  of  performance  indicators,  (iii)  problems  encountered  and  actions  taken  to  address \nthem,  (iv)  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  (v)  program  of  activities  proposed  for  the \nfollowing quarter. Within 3 months after project completion, the PIU will prepare and submit to \nADB a project completion report describing project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, \nand impact. \n \n\n 8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n61. \nAnnual Operational Plans. To ensure efficient project implementation, the Government \nwill prepare and provide ADB with the next fiscal year\u2019s project operational plan at least 30 days \nbefore  the  start  of  the  next  fiscal  year.  The  operational  plan  will  mainly  include    (i)  project \nactivities  with  cost  estimates  proposed  for  each  component/subcomponent  with  performance \ntargets; (ii) a plan for complying with outstanding loan covenants; (iii) a breakdown of financial \nrequirements, including loan proceeds withdrawal and counterpart funds from the Government; \nand (iv) details of how project activities are to be integrated into other ongoing programs. \n \n62.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Project  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  MSDVTE  through  the  PIU  and  will  build  on  the  SDP  M&E  system.  In  the  first \nyear  of  implementation,  a  baseline  indicator  study  will  be  conducted  to  refine  and  expand \nverifiable indicators of project inputs, outputs, and impact, including internal efficiency of project \ninstitutions,  external  efficiency  of  technician  and  technology  programs,  cost-effectiveness  of \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ntraining  programs,  and  gender  disaggregation.  MSDVTE,  primarily  TVEC  and  the  planning \nsection, will be responsible for output and impact M&E. The Project will refine EMIS to regularly \ncollect  information  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  project  activities  in  CoTs  and  Univotec, \nand  to  provide  information  for  OBB.  Project  M&E  data,  including  from  EMIS,  will  be  regularly \nreported  and  analyzed  in  quarterly  and  annual  reports  submitted  to  ADB.  The  Project  will \ninclude  strengthening  MSDVTE  capacity  for  policy  analysis.  MSDVTE  will  conduct  studies  on \nTEVT issues and policies, including tracing trainee-graduates. \n \n\nProject Review \n\nimplementation  arrangements, \n\n9. \n \n63. \nBesides  regular  reviews,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm \nreview during the Project\u2019s third year. Among other things, they will (i) review the project scope, \ndesign, \ninstitutional  development,  and  capacity-building \nprocesses;  (ii)  review  changes  in  Government  policies  and  institutional  framework  since \nappraisal  and  evaluate  their  impact  on  the  Project;  (iii)  assess  project  implementation  against \nperformance  indicators;  (iv)  review  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (v)  identify  critical  issues \nand  constraints;  and  (vi)  recommend  changes  in  project  design  or  implementation  as  needed. \nSpecific attention will be given to a review of (i) the number of staff members who have received \noverseas  training  and  have  been  retained,  (ii)  access  of  minority  groups  and  women  to  CoTs \nand Univotec, and (iii) the impact of OBB on the overall efficiency of CoTs. One month at most \nbefore  the  review,  the  PIU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  comprehensive  report  on  each  of  the  above-\nmentioned issues. The review will recommend changes in project design and implementation as \nneeded. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts  \n\n \nA.  \n \nInstitutional  and  Sectoral  Benefits.  The  Project  will  strengthen  and  expand  the \n64. \ncapacity for technician and technological education. The quality, relevance, and sustainability of \nthese education programs will be improved by (i) developing training and program standards for \ntechnicians  and  technologists;  (ii)  upgrading  selected  TCs  to  CoTs;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  TEVT  teachers,  trainers,  personnel,  and  administrators.  Developing  the  NVQ  for \ntechnicians  and  technologists  will  help  institutionalize  an  alternative  education  and  training \npathway,  particularly  for  school  leavers,  in  technical  and  technology  education  leading  to  a \ndegree. The establishment of a voluntary national association of TEVT providers and ISCs will \nincrease the market orientation of training programs.  \n \n65. \nSocial  Benefits.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  reduce  the  high  rate  of \nunemployment  and  underemployment  among  the  educated  youth,  and  increase  access  to \npostsecondary education and training. Univotec and the CoTs will provide more education and \ntraining  opportunities  and  options  to  the  youth  and  unemployed.  By  upgrading  TCs  to  CoTs \noutside Colombo in all provinces, postsecondary education and training will be made accessible \nto more potential student-trainees, including those who cannot afford to travel to Colombo. With \nthe  medium  of  instruction  proposed  to  be  English,  ethnicity  and  local  language-related \nprejudices  will  be  minimized  and  cross-cultural  communication  strengthened  among  the \nstudents  and  staff.  Bridging  programs  will  help  minimize  knowledge  gaps  arising  from \ndifferences in education quality across schools.  \n \n66. \nSocial  marketing  and  career  guidance  services  will  focus  on  promoting  technology-\nbased employment; increasing public awareness of  technological career paths; and promoting \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ntrade,  technician,  and  technology  programs  to  women.  The  introduction  of  new  training \nprograms, including in fields that are not traditionally male-oriented, will help attract women to \ntechnician programs. The degree and diploma programs will not only increase the employability \nof  the  youth  and  other  groups  but  will  also  serve  as  an  alternative  education  and  training \npathway  for  fulfilling  their  personal  aspirations.  The  programs  will  allow  youth  to  develop  their \ngeneric and technical skills, which are useful for employment as well as for social participation.  \n \n67. \nEconomic  Benefits.  Coupled  with  MSDVTE\u2019s  strengthened  capacity  to  ensure \nrelevance,  quality,  and  efficiency  of  TEVT,  the  B.Tech.,  B.Tech.Ed.,  and  technician  diploma \nprograms  will  increase  the  number  of  skilled  workers  who  can  fill  the  supply\u2013demand  gap  in \nvarious domestic industries as well as in the foreign labor market. The direct economic benefits \nof the Project are (i) increased domestic production because of the greater use of human capital \nthat will be reflected in wage increases of the graduates employed in domestic industries, and \n(ii) increased remittances in foreign exchange from graduates employed abroad. See Appendix \n13 for the economic and financial analysis.  \n \n68. \nThe  Project  is  envisioned  to  increase  annual  enrollment  intake  capacity  of  technician \ndiploma  programs  by  about  2,400  full-time  and  part-time  students.  Similarly,  Univotec  is \nexpected to have an annual enrollment intake capacity of about 600 full-time and 600 part-time \nstudents in the technologist program, and about 300 full-time and 300 part-time students in the \ntechnical  teacher  education  program.  Over  the  15-year  evaluation,  about  15,300  more  youths \nare expected to graduate\u20149,900 with a B.Tech. and 5,400 with a B.Tech.Ed from Univotec, and \nabout  22,500  with  technician  diplomas  from  CoTs.  With  higher  skill  qualifications  in  the  TEVT \nsector,  graduates  from  the  project  institutions  will  be  rewarded  with  higher  wages  and  faster \npromotion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  20.4%  in  the  base-case \nscenario. \n \nB. \n \n69. \nThe  political  conflict  in  Sri  Lanka  presents  a  major  risk  to  achieving  the  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment  goal.  Without  peace  and  stability,  the  local  economy  may  not  develop  and/or \nadvance,  and  local  demand  for  technicians  and technologists  may  stagnate.  However,  even  if \nlocal demand were stagnant, overseas demand for skilled and highly skilled Sri Lankans would \nremain strong. \n \n70. \nInstitutional  Risk.  MSDVTE  requires  capacity  strengthening  to  build  a  private\u2013public \npartnership-based  TEVT  system.  The  high  turnover  of  personnel  has  contributed  to  unstable, \nsometimes  weak,  leadership  and  administration.  The  project  design  includes  capacity \nstrengthening  of  TVEC,  CoTs,  and  Univotec  officials  to  ensure  continuity  when  the  leadership \nchanges.  Private  sector  participation  in  CoT  advisory  councils,  national  association  of  training \nproviders,  and  ISCs  will  encourage  the  private  sector  to  play  a  key  role  in  promoting, \npatronizing,  and  sustaining  TEVT,  while  contributing  to  greater  market  relevance  of  training \nprograms.  \n \nSustainability of Project Investment. Because the Government fully finances the cost \n71. \nof  training  programs  and  provides  small  stipends  to  trainees,  the  sustainability  of  project \ninvestment after implementation depends on the Government\u2019s commitment to funding TEVT as \nevidenced  by  adequate  provision  of  an  O&M  budget,  including  updates  of  curricula,  learning \nmaterials, and software. The Project will develop and implement OBB for CoTs and assess the \npowers that may be decentralized to CoTs to encourage them to be more efficient. The capacity \nof heads of CoTs for strategic planning to generate TEVT revenues will be strengthened.  \n \n\nProject Risks and Assumptions \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n72. \nImplementation Risk. The implementation of the first and second loan projects suffered \nfrom,  among  others,  delays  and  complex  problems  brought  about  by  the  transfer  of  project \nresponsibility from one ministry to another, lack of counterpart funds, and slow appointment of \nqualified  project  staff.  The  Government  has  reassured  ADB  that  it  is  committed  to  the  Project \nthat it will allocate the necessary counterpart funds, and that SDP PIU staff will continue under \nthe Project, subject to satisfactory performance. Qualified instructors and trainers are assumed \nto  be  available.  The  Project  includes  upgrading  staff  skills  and  knowledge,  which  will  be \ndelivered flexibly. The Government can hire temporary staff as needed. Parliament could delay \nthe approval of or not approve the Univotec Act. The Government has given its reassurance that \nit is deeply committed to supporting the Univotec charter.  \n \n73. \nSafeguard  Measures.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix  14.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  aspects  were  reviewed;  no  adverse  impacts  are \nanticipated.  The  amount  of  waste  generated  under  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  small, \nparticularly  hazardous  substances,  which  should  be  negligible.  Nevertheless,  environmental \nconsiderations  will  be  incorporated  into  the  project  activities  to  avoid  any  minor  environmental \nimpacts  during  refurbishment  of  training  institutions  and  in  the  disposal  of  training  waste \nmaterials.  Where  substances  designated  as  hazardous  or  toxic  under  national  law  are  to  be \nused as part of training activities in laboratories, waste management plans will be formulated to \nprotect  human  health  and  the  environment,  and  to  ensure  the  safe  collection,  transport, \ntreatment,  storage,  and  disposal  of  such  substances.  The  plans  will  highlight  segregation  of \ntoxic  substances  at  source,  recovery  and  use  of  recovered  materials,  and  safe  disposal  in \ndesignated  hazardous  waste  landfill  sites.  The  Project  will  have  positive  impacts  on  all  ethnic \ngroups without favoring any. However, in the event of any negative project impact on an ethnic \nminority  or  any  positive  impact  not  accruing  to  an  ethnic  group,  safeguard  measures  will  be \nincluded  either  in  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  as  per  the  approved  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  framework,  or  as  specific  action  in  resettlement  plans.  With  no  planned  land \nacquisition, the Project is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n74. \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  heads  of  the  CoTs  will  be  selected  through  a \nprocess of open application and selection will be based on merit.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  advisory  councils  are  established  within  \n3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  are  composed  of  at  least  60%  representation \nfrom employers, manufacturing and service sectors, and industry, and will have \nheld its first meeting. \n\n(iii)  Within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MSDVTE  will  have  developed,  approved, \nand introduced new technician curricula with various technology specializations, \nincluding  bridging  programs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  technician \nprograms in the nine CoTs will conform to the same program standards and will \nnot vary in structure.  \n\n(iv)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  MSDVTE  will  have  developed  and \ninstitutionalized  a  procedure  for  the  selection  of  applicants  to  the  technician \neducation program, including an admissions test. GCE A/L will not be  made  an \nentry criterion and NVQ will receive equal consideration.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Ministry  of  Public  Administration  will \nrecognize  the  diplomas  issued  by  CoTs  for  entry  into  the  public  service  within  \n3 years of loan effectiveness.  \n\n(vi)  MSDVTE will ensure that CoT staff who participate in staff development activities \n\n(vii) \n\nwill be replaced on an interim basis.  \nIf  the  B.Tech.  Ed.  program  does  not  start  within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  \nthe  Government  will  ensure  that  an  equivalent  program  arrangement  for \nupgrading the qualifications of staff is developed and entered into. The equivalent \nprogram will start within 3 years of loan effectiveness.  \n\n(viii)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the Management Services Department of the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning and MSDVTE will have approved the cadre of \ntrainers, instructors, as well as technical and administrative staff needed for the \neffective and efficient operation of the nine CoTs and Univotec. Within 2 years of \nloan effectiveness, at least 90% of such cadre will have taken up their position. \nFemales will comprise at least 20% of the academic staff by the end of the third \nyear of implementation.  \n\n(x) \n\n(ix)  Within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MSDVTE  will  have  approved  and  fully \ninstitutionalized OBB for the CoTs, including its related management information \nsystem.  MSDVTE  will  ensure  that  all  budgetary  allocations  for  the  CoTs  as  of \nyear 3 of project implementation will be in accordance with OBB.  \nStudies  of  cost  recovery  mechanisms  in  the  TEVT  sector  will  be  completed  by \nthe  second  year  of  project  implementation  and  piloting  of  some  will  have  been \ninitiated by midterm in at least 3 project CoTs.  \nBy  the  end  of  the  third  year  of  project  implementation,  MSDVTE  will  have \ndeveloped a 5-year budget and sustainability plan for the CoTs and Univotec and \nrelevant  authorities  will  have  approved  such  a  plan.  The  approved  plan  will \ninclude  clear  budgetary  allocations  for  consumables  on  an  expanding  basis,  as \nwell  as  a  decision  to  move  the  O&M  costs  for  the  CoTs  and  Univotec  from  the \ndevelopment budget to the recurrent budget by the end of the Project.  \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii)  Within  3  months  of  the  passage  of  the  Univotec  Act,  the  members  of  its \ngoverning body will have been notified by MSDVTE and will have held their first \nmeeting. \n\n(xiii)  Within  1  year  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Act  creating  Univotec,  a  transparent \nprocedure for the selection of applicants to the degree programs will have been \ndeveloped and institutionalized. The requirements will include NVQ levels 5 and \n6 and similar qualifications.  \n\n(xiv)  Within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MSDVTE  will  have  developed,  approved, \n\nand introduced new curricula leading to B.Tech. and B.Tech.Ed. at Univotec.  \n\n(xv)  Within  4  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  baseline  M&E  study  will  have  been \n\ncompleted.  \n\n(xvi)  Throughout  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  allocate  sufficient \nbudget in its recurrent budget to maintain the 2005\u20132006 level of operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  technical  and  vocational  schools  funded  by  the  ADB  under \nthe SDP.  \n\n(xvii)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, MSDVTE will develop and approve a policy \nand  action  plan  to  ensure  equal  access  for  different  population  groups  to  CoTs \nand Univotec. The Government will ensure that the governing bodies of Univotec \nand of each CoT will adopt such policy and implement them by year 2.  \n\n(xviii)  The Government will ensure that the Project will be implemented in accordance \nwith  the  ethnic  minority  development  framework,  resettlement  framework,  and \nthe gender action plan.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nlabor \n\nlaws,  do  not  employ  child \n\n(xix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \nfor  construction  and \napplicable \nmaintenance activities, and do not differentiate wages between men and women \nfor work of equal value.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  compliance  with  existing  environmental  laws  and \nregulations of Sri Lanka, the environmental policy of ADB,9 and the actions listed \nin para. 75.  \n\nlabor \n\n(xx) \n\n(xxi)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  in  accordance  with  relevant  labor \nlegislation, each institution involved in delivering training courses will prepare and \napprove  an  occupational  health  and  safety  plan  (OHSP)  covering  work-related \nsafety  and  health  issues  of  personnel  and  public.  The  OHSP  will  include  an \nemergency plan for accidents and calamities. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \n \nB.  \n \nThe  following  conditions  will  be  met  by  the  Government  before  the  loan  becomes \n75. \neffective:  (i)  the  PSC  shall  have  been  established,  its  members  notified,  and  shall  have  met \nonce;  (ii)  the  Government  will  have  approved  the  establishment  of  the  Project  CoTs;  \n(iii) MSDVTE will have confirmed the technical areas for support; and (iv) DTET will have issued \na  circular  delegating  authority  to  CoTs  in  the  areas  of  revenue  generation,  spending,  and \nselection of course offerings. \n \nC.  \n \n76. \nUntil the Univotec Act has been passed by Parliament and made effective, no withdrawal \nwill be made from the loan for any project activity under subcomponents 3.A(i), 3.A(ii), 3.A(iii), \nand 3.C.  \n\nConditions for Disbursement  \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n77. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  13,605,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Technical  Education  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n26 October 2005 \n \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2002.

The first tier of training programs consists of certificate courses, which \nare designed to produce semi-skilled to crafts-level workers, and usually require a pass in the \nGeneral  Certificate  of  Education  (GCE)  ordinary  level  (O/L)  examination  in  the  required \nsubjects.  These  courses  range  in  duration  from  6  months  to  4  years. The  next  tier  of  courses \nconsists  of  diploma  programs,  which  currently  cater  to  students  who  passed  their  GCE \nadvanced  level  (A/L)  examination  with  relatively  good  marks  in  mathematics,  physics,  and \nchemistry.  The  objective  of  these  programs  is  to  prepare  the  students  to  become  versatile \ntechnicians capable of performing a broad spectrum of work between that of an engineer and a \nskilled worker. These programs vary in duration from 3 to 4 years.  \n \nCertificate  programs  are  offered  by  major  public  providers  under  the  purview  of  the \n2. \nMinistry  of  Skills  Development,  Vocational  and  Technical  Education  (MSDVTE).  These  major \npublic  providers  are  the  National  Apprentice  and  Industrial  Training  Authority  (NAITA),  \nthe  Vocational  Training  Authority  (VTA),  the  Department  of  Technical  Education  and  Training \n(DTET),  and  the  Ceylon-German  Technical  Training  Institute.  The  National  Youth  Services \nCouncil  (NYSC)  and  other  ministries  also  offer  craft-level  and  certificate  courses.  DTET  is  the \nlead  agency  for  technical  education  programs.  About  320  public  TEVT  institutions  throughout \nthe  country  are  operated  by  these  major  public  TEVT  providers.  A  number  of  ministries  are \ninvolved in TEVT, either as part of their mandated functions or as part of serving their respective \nsectors.  The  distribution  of  other  public  TEVT  providers  and  operators  is  as  follows:  \n379  statutory  bodies,  209  government  institutions,  and  21  special  institutions.  The  National \nCertificate in Engineering (Craft Courses) is the main technical education program. The full-time \nprogram is 2 years long. The curriculum has 60\u201370% practical content and 30\u201340% theoretical \ncontent, with credits given for every subject every semester.  \n \n3. \nDiploma  programs  are  offered  by  at  least  four  recognized  institutions  in  Sri  Lanka:  \nthe  Technician  Training  Institute  (TTI)  under  NAITA,  the  Mattakuliya  Advanced  Technical \nInstitute with the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technical Education (SLIATE), the Institute of \nTechnology-Moratuwa University (ITUM), and the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL). Each of \nthese  institutions  has  its  own  curriculum.  Generally,  the  curriculum  is  about  60%  practical \ncontent  and  40%  theoretical.  After  completing  the  program,  students  are  awarded  a  diploma \nsuch as a Higher National Diploma in Engineering (HNDE), a National Diploma of Technology \n(NDT), a National Diploma in Engineering Sciences (NDES), or a Diploma of Technology (DT).  \n \nPostsecondary  higher  technical  education  is  relatively  underdeveloped.  Only  a  limited \n4. \nnumber  of  mandated  public  providers  and  a  few  enterprising  private  technical  institutions  with \nforeign affiliations are engaged in higher technical skills development. This is one of the major \nreasons for the bottleneck in responding to labor market demands. In addition, there is a need \nto  provide  vertical  mobility  to  the  holders  of  Higher  National  Diplomas  in  Science  and \nTechnology in order for them to aspire to higher education and enhance their productivity, and \nto  ensure  their  life-long  employability  and  self-fulfillment.  So  far,  only  one  institution  of  higher \nlearning  in  the  country  has  addressed  this  need,  the  OUSL,  which  offers  distance-learning \nprograms. \n \n5. \nThe Government is the main financier and provider of TEVT in Sri Lanka. As the TEVT \nsystem has expanded, activities are being duplicated and the system is facing operational and \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1          21\n\nfinancial  constraints.  These  affect  the  efficiency,  relevance,  and  quality  of  TEVT.  There  is  a \nshortage of qualified teachers and conditions of facilities are poor. Most of the TEVT institutions \nare  not  motivated  to  improve  or  to  broaden  their  financial  base  because  of  the  lack  of  a \nfacilitating policy environment. Public\u2013private partnership in TEVT is yet to be fully realized and \nthe private sector could play a greater role.  \n \n6. \nThere  are  a  growing  number  of  private  providers  of  TEVT  courses,  but  these  mostly \nfocus on information technology. They award an assortment of certificates and diplomas with no \nassurance  of  quality  or  national  recognition.  From  consultations,  there  appears  to  be \ntremendous variation in their training quality, from outstanding to very poor. This may compound \nthe  unemployment  situation  and  discourage  youth  from  pursuing  TEVT  programs.  By  law,  the \nprovision  of  TEVT  by  the  private  sector  and  by  nongovernment  organizations  requires \nregistration, accreditation and approval by the government through the Tertiary and Vocational \nEducation  Commission  (TVEC).  About  350  private  TEVT  institutions  are  registered  with  the \nTVEC. There are wide gaps in the enforcement of the present system, which need to be filled \nbefore  consistent  training  quality  becomes  a  reality.  There  are  no  professional  associations \nsuch  as  private  accrediting  bodies  and  no  peer  or  professional  evaluation  of  institutions  and \nprograms. It is very difficult to determine the supply capacity of the private sector.  \n \n7. \ninternational  nongovernment \norganizations (INGOs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) operating in the country, only \n128 of which are registered with TVEC. Training by these organizations is undertaken mainly to \nsupport  farming,  micro-enterprise  development,  or  basic  craft  skills.  On  occasion,  these \norganizations ask public providers to recognize their training programs.  \n \nB. \n \n\nPlanning and Development of Technical Education and Vocational Training \n\nthere  are  a  considerable  number  of \n\nIn  addition, \n\n1. \n\nTertiary and Vocational Education Commission  \n\n \nTVEC  serves  as  the  main  arm  of  MSDVTE  in  planning,  coordinating,  and  monitoring \n8. \ntertiary  education  and  training.  TVEC  was  established  as  a  statutory  body  with  the  following \ngeneral  objectives:  (i)  the  planning,  coordination  and  development  of  tertiary  education  and \nvocational  education  at  all  levels  in  keeping  with  the  human  resource  needs  of  the  economy; \n(ii) the  development  of  nationally  recognized  systems  for  the  granting  of  tertiary  education \nawards,  including  certificates  and  other  academic  distinctions;  and  (iii)  the  maintenance  of \nacademic and training standards in institutes, agencies and all other establishments that provide \ntertiary  education  and  vocational  education.  However,  the  TVEC  is  failing  to  carry  out  its \nfunctions  because  of  lack  of  resources  and  consequent  weak  capacity.  The  ongoing  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Skills Development Project (SDP)1 provides support to TVEC in skills \nstandards  development,  establishment  of \nthe  National  Vocational  Qualification  (NVQ) \nFramework,  and  the  development  accreditation  system,  which  will  partly  address  these \nconstraints. The NVQ Framework has been finalized. It has seven levels, of which only levels  \n1 to 4 have been developed. About 45 skills standards for selected trades have been developed \nand  are  now  being  implemented  in  a  number  of  TEVT  institutions.  The  full  operation  of  an \naccreditation system, however, may not be realized within the implementation period of SDP.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Institute of Technical Education Sri Lanka  \n\n \n9. \nThe  National  Institute  of  Technical  Education  Sri  Lanka  (NITESL)  is  another  important \narm of the MSDVTE, particularly for technical teacher education and staff development. It was \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1999.

Manila. \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nteaching  methodology,  educational \n\nOperation and Constraints of Major Technical Education Providers \n\nestablished  in  1998  as  a  statutory  body  to  assist  the  ministry  and  TVEC  to  formulate  TEVT \npolicy  and  to  promote  teacher  education,  research  and  development.  Among  its  mandated  \nfunctions are to (i) provide training programs and services in technical and vocational education; \n(ii) implement and maintain a system for examination and accreditation; (iii) initiate and promote \npractices  connected  with  training  teachers  in  technical  and vocational  education,  including  the \nadaptation of appropriate technology for training purposes; (iv) provide professional services in \nthe various functional areas of technical and vocational education and training, human resource \ndevelopment,  curriculum  development, \ntechnology, \nvocational guidance and counseling; (v) provide and promote graduate and postgraduate level \ntechnical and vocational education and training; (vi) undertake and promote research and other \nstudies on all aspects of technical and vocational education and training; and (vii) sponsor and \nhold  conferences,  seminars  and  workshops,  and  publish  books,  journals  and  magazines  in \nconnection  with  all  aspects  of  TEVT.  NITESL  needs  to  do  much  more  to  address  the  acute \nshortage of TEVT teachers, including updating their knowledge, improving their teaching skills, \nand  raising  their  qualifications.  There  is  a  need  to  update  its  resources  and  strengthen  its \ncapacity  for  technical  teacher  training,  curriculum  development,  flexible  training  delivery,  and \nmultimedia learning. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nDTET and NAITA are under MSDVTE. SLIATE was formerly with MSDVTE but  is now \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Education;  ITUM  and  OUSL  are  autonomous  bodies  that  offer  technical \neducation.  Most  of  these  are  corporate  bodies  with  specific  mandates,  separate  and \nindependent  governing  bodies,  and  diverse  organizational  structures.  Close  scrutiny  of  public \nTEVT organizations reveals functional and resource duplication. The organizations are supply-\noriented and their programs overlap. Moreover, major TEVT providers under MSDVTE need to \nbe  reoriented  toward  a  unified,  sustainable,  and  market-driven  TEVT  system.  All  of  the \ninstitutions  offering  technician-level  and  diploma  programs  require  GCE  A/L  qualifications  for \nadmission,  which  hampers  their  response  to  the  demand  for  technicians  and  technologists. \nTechnician  programs  in  the  current  system  have  diverse  admission  requirements,  duration, \ncurriculum design and content mix, training arrangements and delivery, and award and program \naccreditation.   \n \nDepartment of Technical Education and Training. DTET has the mandate to develop \n11. \nskilled workers and craftsmen. Under its direct supervision and control are 37 technical colleges \nthroughout the country that offer courses up to the certificate level. The total enrollment in 2003 \nwas 18,265 and the dropout rate averaged about 25% over the last 5 years. More than any of \nthe other line agencies, DTET has, over time, gone through various institutional arrangements. \nIn  2004,  it  came  under  the  authority  of  MSDVTE.  As  a  government  agency,  DTET  faces  the \nmajor  constraint  of  lacking  autonomy  or  corporate  powers  that  are  vested  in  statutory  bodies \nsuch as NITESL, TVEC, SLIATE, and VTA. Students with GCE O/L qualifications are eligible for \nadmission  into  its  certificate  programs.  Currently,  the  DTET  capacity  to  fulfill  its  mandate  is \nconstrained  by  a  lack  of  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance,  lack  of  qualified  teaching  staff, \nand outdated programs and equipment. \n \nSri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technical Education. SLIATE is mandated to offer \n12. \ndiploma  programs  in  technical  education.  It  has  18  advanced  technical  institutes  (ATIs), \n11 independent and 7 attached, located throughout the country. Of these, only the Mattakuliya \nATI is engaged in technical/technician training. It offers the HNDE and has an annual intake of \nabout 150 students. The administration, management, and control of the affairs of the SLIATE \nare  vested  in  its  governing  council,  which  is  composed  of  15  members  representing  mostly \ngovernment  line  agencies,  professional  bodies,  the  federation  of  chambers  of  commerce  and \nindustry, and persons of recognized competence and eminence in the relevant areas of studies. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1          23\n\nincorporated  under \n\nthe  National  Apprenticeship  Board,  which  was \n\nThe Director-General serves as the principal executive and academic officer, under the general \ndirection of its Governing Council, and is appointed by the minister with 5-years tenure of office. \nThe institute is poorly equipped, lacks sufficient qualified full-time and motivated teaching staff, \nand lacks resources for operation and maintenance.   \n \nNational  Apprentice  and  Industrial  Training  Authority.  NAITA  conducts  training  in \n13. \napprenticeable trades and operates highly specialized institutes such as the Technician Training \nInstitute and the Automotive Training Institute. NAITA places its trainees in industry. It operates \n49  training  centers  (4  national  and  45  small  centers),  with  a  total  enrollment  of  16,448  and  a \ndropout  rate  of  about  29%  in  2003.  NAITA  is  a  corporate  body  established  under  TVEC \nprovisions (Part II, Act No. 20 of 1990, as amended by Act No. 50 of 1999) and is the successor \nto \nthe  National \nApprenticeship  Act  No.  49  of  1971.  The  Authority  has  the  following  objectives:  (i)  planning, \norganizing  and  providing  training;  (ii)  specifying  standards  in  relation  to  vocational  training; \n(iii) conducting  national  trade  tests;  (iv)  conducting  research  and  development  in  vocational \ntraining;  (v)  holding  competitions  to  promote  the  development  of  various  skills;  (vi)  developing \nthe  training  capacities  of  establishments  and  other  institutions  providing  vocational  training; \n(vii) advising the TVEC on vocational training; and (viii) linking up with institutions in Sri Lanka \nand  abroad  that  have  similar  objectives  and  equating  and/or  validating  certificates,  diplomas \nand  degrees  in  allied  subjects  and  courses.  NAITA  is  governed  by  a  board  of  management, \nwhich  consists  of  not  more  than  15  members  representing  government  institutions,  trade \nunions,  commerce,  and  industry.  NAITA  has  established  strong  links  with  industry  through  its \nenterprise-based  apprenticeship  programs,  despite  shortages  of  funding  and  staffing,  and \noutdated facilities. \n \nInstitute  of  Technology\u2013University  of  Moratuwa.  ITUM  offers  technician  education \n14. \nprograms leading to an NDT. The program consists of 2 years of full-time studies and 1 year of \nindustrial training under the supervision of NAITA. The program operates on an annual system. \nThe  available  fields  of  NDT  specialization  are  civil,  chemical,  electrical,  electronics  and \ntelecommunications, marine, mechanical, nautical, polymer, and textile and clothing. The entry \nqualification for these courses is a GCE A/L pass in mathematics and age between 18-24 years. \nIn addition, an aptitude test is given. A special feature of the curriculum is that all students are \nrequired  to  pass  basic  courses  held  4  hours  a  week  for  1  year.  Currently,  the  facilities  and \nequipment  used  for  instruction  and  laboratory  work  of  students  are  shared  with  the  Faculty  of \nEngineering. Only a few courses have separate buildings for workshops and laboratories. \n \n15. \nOpen  University  of  Sri  Lanka.  OUSL  is  the  only  institution  in  Sri  Lanka  which  offers \ntechnician  and  technological  education  programs  leading  to  a  diploma  and  a  degree  in \nengineering technology. The Faculty of Engineering Technology is responsible for carrying out \nthese programs. OUSL differs from conventional universities, technical colleges, and institutes \nin  that  it  makes  use  of  flexible  delivery  and  distance  learning  modes.  This  provides  greater \nopportunities  for  employed  persons  without  age  or  educational  restrictions.  The  OUSL  has  a \nstudent population of about 20,000, spread across 21 regional and study centers throughout the \ncountry. The OUSL, unlike most government universities and technical colleges, charges fees, \nincluding a registration fee, a facilities fee, an exemption fee, and a tuition fee.  \n \n16. \nThe  areas  of  specialization  are  agriculture,  automobile,  civil,  computers,  electrical, \nelectronics  and  communications,  manufacturing,  and  textile  engineering.  Each  course  is \nassessed  through  continuous  assessment  and  final  examinations.  Continuous  assessment \nincludes laboratory work, field classes, assignments, presentations, and tests. The DT of OUSL \nis comparable to the NDT, NDES and HNDE programs of the other institutions above. It is one \nof  the  avenues  for  entry  to  mid-level  technical  grades  within  the  engineering  profession.  \nThe  minimum  program  duration  is  4  years.  The  minimum  completion  time  for  the  Bachelor  of \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nTechnology  (B.Tech.)  degree  is  7  years,  although  in  practice  it  takes  longer.  Holders  of  the \nB.Tech.  degree  are  expected  to  develop  their  creative,  analytical  and  innovative  thinking \ncapabilities and to increase their ability to access knowledge. Normally, entry into this program \nis through the DT, although other paths are also possible. \n \n\nFigure A1: Education and Training Systems in Sri Lanka \n\nVocational Certificate\n\nCraft-level / Higher Certificate\n\nTechnician Diploma\n\nProfe-\nssional \nDegree\n\nLevel of \nEducation\n\nAge\n\n \n\nYear of \nSchooling\n\n20\n\n19\n\n18\n\n17\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\n12\n\n11\n\n10\n\n09\n\n08\n\n07\n\n06\n\n05\n\n04\n\n03\n\n02\n\n01\n\n)\n\nS\nE\nD\nN\n\n(\n \n\nI\n\nA\nT\nA\nN\n\n)\nT\nD\n\n(\n \nL\nS\nU\nO\n\n)\n\nE\nD\nN\nH\n\n(\n \n\nE\nT\nA\nL\nS\n\nI\n\n)\nT\nD\nN\n\n(\n \n\nM\nU\nT\n\nI\n\n \ns\ne\n\ni\nt\ni\ns\nr\ne\nv\nn\nU\n\ni\n\n \nl\n\na\nn\no\ni\nt\nn\ne\nv\nn\no\nC\n\n)\ns\ns\ne\nr\ng\ne\nd\n\n \nl\n\ni\n\na\nn\no\ns\ns\ne\nf\no\nr\np\n(\n\nUniversity \nand Higher \nEducation\n\nCOLLEGIATE LEVEL\n\nGCE A/L\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.\ns\nr\ny\n \n4\n\u2013\n3\n \nI\n\nT\nT\nG\nC\n\n)\ne\nt\na\nc\ni\nf\ni\nt\nr\ne\nC\n\n \nr\ne\nh\ng\nH\n\ni\n\n(\n\n \n \n \ne\nc\ni\nt\nn\ne\nr\np\np\nA\nA\nT\nA\nN\n\n \n\nI\n\n)\n.\ns\nr\ny\n \n3\n\u2013\n1\n(\n\n-\n \n.\ns\no\nm\n \n6\n(\n \n\nA\nT\nV\n\n)\n.\ns\nr\ny\n \n2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nT\nE\nT\nD\n\n \n)\n.\ns\nr\ny\n \n2\n\u2013\n.\nt\nr\ne\nC\n\n(\n\n \n \n \n.\nc\nt\nE\n\n \n2\n\u2013\n1\n\n.\ns\nr\ny\n\nBasic Skills Training\n\nSENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nGCE O/L\n\nJUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nSECONDARY \nEDUCATION\n\nPRIMARY SCHOOL\n\nPRIMARY \nEDUCATION\n\n \n  A/L = advanced level, CGTTI = Ceylon German Technical Training Institute, DT = diploma of technology, DTET = \nDepartment of Technical Education and Training, GCE = general certificate of education, HNDE = higher national \ndiploma  in  engineering,  ITUM  =  Institute  of  Technology\u2013Moratuwa,  NAITA  =  National  Apprentice  and  Industrial \nTraining Authority, NDES = national diploma in engineering sciences, NDT = national diploma of technology, O/L \n= ordinary level, OUSL = Open University of Sri Lanka , VTA = Vocational Training Authority. \nSource: ADB. 2005.

The  First  Technical  Education  Project  (FTEP) \naimed  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  craft  and  technician  education  and  training \nprovided  at  the  technical  colleges  (TCs)  under  the  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  (MOHE).  \nThe FTEP assisted in (i) establishing the National Technical Teacher Training College (now the \nNational  Institute  of  Technical  Education  Sri  Lanka  [NITESL]);  (ii)  updating  equipment  and \nfacilities of 20 selected TCs; and (iii) upgrading management of the technical education system \nthrough  the  establishment  of  the  Technical  Education  Division,  which  was  upgraded  into  the \nDepartment of Technical Education and Training (DTET) and later transferred to the Ministry of \nLabor and Vocational Training in 1994. The Project closed in 1988. \n \nSecond  Technical  Education  Project.  The  Second  Technical  Education  Project \n3. \n(STEP)  was  intended  to  enhance  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  technical  education  by \ncomplementing  the  achievements  and  addressing  the  shortcomings  of  the  FTEP.  STEP \nconsisted  of  two  main  components,  (i)  an  educational  development  program,  and  (ii)  the \nrehabilitation and augmentation of facilities in institutions under the former Technical Education \nDivision  of  MOHE.  The  educational  development  program  component  was  focused  on \nimproving the administration of the Technical Education Division and TCs, the functions of the \nNational Technical Teachers\u2019 Training College, the further development and implementation of \nTC courses, and staff training and career development. The other component dealt mainly with \nupgrading  facilities  in  12  TCs  that  were  not  included  under  the  FTEP;  the  provision  of  new \nequipment;  and  the  provision  of  limited  staff  accommodation  and  a  hostel  for  women.  \nThe project was executed initially by MOHE and was later transferred to the Ministry of Labor \nand Vocational Training (MOLVT) in 1994. STEP was completed in 1995. \n \n4. \nSkills  Development  Project.  The  ongoing  Skills  Development  Project  (SDP)  was \ndesigned  to  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  skills  training  by  reorienting  the  vocational \ntraining  system  through  the  introduction  of  competency-based  training  to  ensure  a  closer \npartnership  between  vocational  institutions  and  the  private  sector.  SDP  is  increasing  both  the \nefficiency  and  the  competence  of  Government  in  the  provision  of  skills  training  programs. \nAlthough it specifically addresses the operations of DTET technical colleges and the vocational \ntraining centers (VTCs) of the Vocational Training Authority (VTA), it addresses all of TEVT by \ninitiating a national vocational qualification (NVQ) system. \n \n5. \nSDP  has:  (i)  developed  a  policy  framework  for  the  institutionalization  of  competency-\nbased training (CBT); (ii) established a national CBT learning resources development centre at \nthe  Ministry  of  Skills  Development,  Vocational  and  Technical  Education  (MSDVTE),  learning \nsource  utilization  centers  and  career  guidance  and  counselling  centers  at  TCs  and  other \ncentres;  (iii)  upgraded  VTC  facilities;  (iv)  developed  20  new  courses  and  converted  \n25  existing  courses  into  CBT  format;  (v)  introduced  entrepreneurship  and  basic  management \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1982.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\nskills  courses;  (vi)  developed  skills  standards  up  to  craftsmen  level;  and  (vii)  established  the \nNVQ Framework. SDP has provided support for the upgrade of facilities and capacity building of \nselected  vocational  training  institutions,  including  six  national  vocational  training  institutions,  \n37  TCs,  239  selected  vocational  training  centers  and  private  sector  and  nongovernment \norganization (NGO)-managed vocational training in eight provinces and 25 districts. \n \n6. \nSDP  has  finalized  basic  policy  documents  for  the  unified  TEVT  system.  These  include \noperations manuals for the National Vocational Qualifications Framework of Sri Lanka, national \nskills  standards,  assessment  and  certification,  and  a  guide  for  CBT  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  NVQ \nframework  is  now  established  and  the  relevant  policy  documents  and  operation  manuals  on \nCBT, course accreditation procedures, quality management checklist for the training providers, \nand  policy  guidelines  for  institutionalization  of  career  guidance  and  counseling  services  have \nbeen  provided  to,  and  are  being  used  at,  all  project  institutions.  MSDVTE  has  endorsed  the \npolicy  establishing  the  NVQ  Framework.  TVEC  has  prepared  an  action  plan  for  effective \nimplementation of the NVQ, quality management system (QMS), and accreditation procedures, \nand a national committee has been established to review the progress of the NVQ system. \n \n7. \nThrough  SDP,  45  skills  standards  have  been  developed  and  recommended  by  the \nNational  Industrial  Training  Advisory  Committee  (NITAC).  Forty-five  curricula  are  ready  for \nimplementation,  and  assessment  materials  and  other  supporting  documents  have  been \nprepared.  However,  skills  standards  have  to  be  reviewed;  45  have  already  been  reviewed.  \nSDP is supporting the implementation of 21 CBT courses in 75 centers and will implement more \nduring the implementation period.  \n \nSDP  has  developed  a  quality  management  system  consisting  of  a  framework, \n8. \nhandbooks,  formats,  and  procedures.  The  quality  management  self-assessment  system  has \nbeen  pilot-tested  and  quality  audits  have  been  initiated  in  several  vocational  training  (VT) \ncenters.  SDP  has  established  career  guidance  and  counseling  centers  and  trained  staff  to \nprovide  support  services.  Learning  resource  utilization  centers  have  been  established  in  50 \ntraining centers. A training management information system has been developed and installed \nin 91 centers.   \n  \nBuilding  on  Past  Assistance.  The  proposed  Project  will  build  on  the  work  of  the \n9. \nongoing  SDP.  The  Project  will  build  on  the  National  Vocational  Qualifications  framework  by  \nadding  NVQ  levels  5,  6  and  7  (technician  to  technologist)  to  the  SDP-initiated  NVQ  1  to  4 \nprogram  standards.  The  proposed  Project  will  further  involve  industry  and  employers  in  the \ninstitutional  transformation  for  identified  growth  areas  and  global  competition  through  advisory \ncouncils and industry sector councils, among others. \n \n10.  World  Bank-Financed  TEVT  Projects.  The  World  Bank  supported  two  TEVT  projects \nin  the  1980s:  (i)  the  Vocational  Training  Project,  which  was  aimed  at  increasing  the  supply  of \ntrained  manpower  and  improving  management  expertise;  and  (ii) the  Second  Vocational \nTraining Project, which established the Institute for Construction Training and Development and \nsupported an intensive management training program. \n \n11. \nSri  Lanka-Germany  Development  Cooperation.  Sri  Lanka  and  Germany  have \ncooperated with each other for 40 years. At present, there are 44 Sri Lanka\u2013Germany projects, \nin  implementation  or  planning  stages.  Two  prominent  projects  relate  to  vocational  training: \n(i) Strengthening  of  Vocational  Training  Project  (SVTP);  and  (ii)  Vocational  Training  for  Rural \nWomen  and  Youth  Project  (VTW).  The  SVTP  was  started  in  early  1997  with  the  National \nApprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and  VTA, in support of technical training,  \nat the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute (CGTTI), the Apprenticeship Training Institute \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(SLGRTTC).  \nthe  Sri  Lanka  German  Railway  Technical  Training  Centre \n(ATI)  and \nThe  VTW  Project  was  started  in  1998  in  collaboration  with  NAITA  and  VTA.  It  sought  to \nenhance  the  capacities  of  local  training  providers  by  helping  them  to  identify  their  training \nneeds;  develop  curricula;  implement  training  programs;  impart  entrepreneurship,  gender \nsensitivity, and environmental awareness; provide on-the-job training; and monitor employment \nafter  training.  The  project  focused  on  upgrading  the  skills  of  women  and  men  for  self-\nemployment ,while encouraging women to take on nontraditional vocations. \n \nDonor  Assistance  Complementing  Technical  Education  Development  Project \n12. \n(TEDP). The Government will be helped to develop TCs into Colleges of Technology (CoTs) by \nthe Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), which will support the strengthening of \nthe  Jaffna  Technical  College;  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  which  will \nhelp  Maradana  Technical  College.  Negotiations  are  underway  to  provide  assistance  for  a \nproposed CoT in the Eastern province and in the Southern province.  \n\n \n \nTable A3.1: External Assistance to the Education Sector and the \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training Subsector \n\n Amount \n($ millon) \n\n         Loan/        Year of \n        Grant       Approval \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSource \n \n\nA.

Lessons Learned from Past ADB TEVT Projects \n\n1. One-shot projects do not work \n\n\u2022  The Project is the fourth ADB TEVT project assistance in Sri \n\nLESSONS LEARNED \n\nIncorporating Lessons Learned  \nin Project Design \n\nLanka in 25 years. The Project builds on the ongoing SDP. SDP \nfocused mainly on setting up the NVQ framework and supporting \nVT. The Project continues the development of the NVQ at the \ntechnician and technologist levels and the capacity-building \nneeded to deliver these programs. \n\n\u2022  Industrial sector councils will be established and will validate \n\nstandards and equipment. CoTs will have advisory councils that \nwill be mostly from industry. A sectoral council will be established \nin CoTs to validate technician curricula. Heads of CoTs will be \nstrengthened in strategic planning and partnerships. \n\n\u2022  The Project provides for strengthening of heads and senior \n\nofficials of CoTs. Part of the dialogue with Government is the \nassignment of dynamic leaders. \n\n \n\n\u2022  The Project is focused on the strengthening of technician and \n\ntechnological education. In view of the political environment, no \nsweeping policy reform is proposed.  \n\n\u2022  Labor market demand analysis will be undertaken for each of the \nprograms. CoTs will develop institutional development plans. \nCoTs will have advisory councils that will be mostly from industry. \nHeads of CoTs will be strengthened in strategic planning and \npartnerships. \n\n\u2022  The Project will support a study to assess the administrative and \n\nregulatory environment of private TEVT provision and to \nrecommend an action plan for their greater participation. \n\n\u2022  For CoTs, the Project will examine the administrative and \n\nregulatory framework to identify powers and responsibilities that \ncan be decentralized to facilitate improved relevance and \nsustainability.  \n\n\u2022  The Project will support a study on financial sustainability \n\nmechanisms. The Project will  (i) review rules and regulations of \nthe Government, MSDVTE, and DTET to assess which \nregulations could be delegated or decentralized to make training \nprograms more efficient and sustainable; (ii) with a view to being \nmore responsive to the needs of employers and to generate some \nrevenues, CoT senior personnel will be given training in strategic \nplanning, industry partnerships, and training needs assessments; \nand (iii) for more efficient allocation of resources, an output-based \nbudgeting system for the CoTs will be developed and \nimplemented. \n\n\u2022  The Project supports the further development of the National \n\nVocational Qualifications Framework, particularly the articulation \nof levels 5\u20137. \n\n2. Need industry linkage \n\n3. Leadership spells difference in \nperformance \n\nB.  Lessons Learned for Project Design \n\n1. Projects should not attempt to do too \nmuch, particularly sweeping reforms, as \nthese would probably be beyond the \nnational implementation capacity.  \n2. Labor market analysis and tracer studies \nare important for proper direction and \nfeedback to training systems.  \n\n3. In the area of private training provision, \nobstacles to growth and improvement, \nincluding regulatory constraints, should be \nexamined.  \n4. Devolution of authority must be designed \nwith a prior assessment of administrative \nand regulatory framework and the \nrequirements for it to succeed.  \n5. Financial sustainability is big challenge \nfor training projects. More emphasis should \nbe given to analyses of sustainability, while \nat the same time being realistic as public \ntraining projects also have equity \nobjectives.  \n\n6. Where reform of training systems is \nundertaken, the establishment of national \nqualification frameworks will facilitate labor \nmobility and more efficient use of training \nresources. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31\n\nLessons Learned \n\nC.

Technological  education \n\n \nA.  \n \nEconomic  Rationale.  To  keep  up  with  rapid  technological  changes  and  to  stay \n1. \ncompetitive  in  increasingly  globalized  markets,  Sri  Lankan  industries  are  demanding  workers \nwith  greater  skills  and  upgrading  the  skills  of  their  workers.  However,  the  technical  education \nand vocational training (TEVT) sector in Sri Lanka currently does not have enough capacity to \nis  still \nmeet \nunderdeveloped, and programs for higher-level technical training are limited: At the technologist \nlevel,  only  the  Open  University  of  Sri  Lanka  (OUSL)  offers  a  Bachelor  in  Technology.  There \nwere  only  17  graduates  from  this  course  in  2003.  At  the  technician  level,  four  public \npostsecondary  institutions  offer  diploma  level  technician  programs  with  total  output  of  612 \ngraduates in 12 technological subjects in 2003. The output from these institutions is extremely \nlow  when  compared  with  industries\u2019  needs.  The  ratio  of  technicians  to  craftsmen  or  skilled \nworkers is low: the normal ratio for a developing economy is about 1:5, while in Sri Lanka the \ncurrent  ratio  is  1:50.  In  order  to  address  the  shortage  of  technologists  and  technicians,  the \nProject will assist the proposed University of Vocational Technology (Univotec) and six Colleges \nof Technology (CoTs) to develop the capacity to train technologists in Bachelor of Technology \n(B.Tech.) programs and technicians in Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) \nprograms.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Skills  Development, \nVocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE) in supporting and facilitating these programs. \n \n2. \nNumber  of  Qualified  TEVT  Instructors.  Only  62%  of  teaching  positions  at  the  four \nmajor TEVT institutions were filled in 2002. The majority of the instructors at technical colleges \n(TCs) are diploma and/or certificate holders, lack adequate industrial experience, and teaching \nskills. There are no degree programs leading to a Bachelor in Technical Education in Sri Lanka. \nThe National Institute of Technical Education Sri Lanka (NITESL) currently offers in-service staff \ndevelopment  programs  for  trainers/teachers  and  conducts  diploma  level  programs  for \ninstructors.1 Under the Project, the NITESL will be upgraded to a faculty of training technology \nwithin  Univotec  and  will  offer  a  degree  program  leading  to  a  Bachelor  of  Technical  Education \n(B.Tech.Ed.) in order to raise the qualifications of instructors at CoTs.    \n \n3. \nDespite  the  supply\u2013demand  gap  for  technicians  and  technologists,  the  number  of \neducated  young  people  without  jobs  is  growing  and  is  a  cause  of  serious  concern.  \nThe  unemployment  rate  for  people  with  at  least  General  Certificate  of  Education  (GCE) \nadvanced level (A/L) qualifications is 17.3%, which is above the average unemployment rate of \n8.5%  in  2004.2  This  implies  a  significant  waste  of  human  resources.  This  mismatch  between \nlabor demand and supply can be mainly attributed to three factors: (i) the limited capacity of the \nTEVT  sector,  (ii) the  unwillingness  of  eligible  youth  to  pursue  careers  as  technicians  or \ntechnologists  because  of  TEVT\u2019s  poor  image,  and  (iii)  the  fact  that  TEVT  courses  tend  to  be \nsupply-driven and unresponsive to industries\u2019 needs. \n \n 4. \nAlternatives Considered. Private sector provision of TEVT services was considered as \nan  alternative  to  the  Project.  Private  sector  participation  in  the  TEVT  sector  is  currently \nconcentrated in information technology (IT). The private sector is not expected to participate in \n\n                                                 \n1  The  National  Diploma  in  Vocational  Training  is  offered  at  National  Institute  of  Technical  Education  Sri  Lanka \n    (NITESL). \n2  Department of Census and Statistics. Quarterly Report of the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey, Third Quarter 2004. \n    Colombo. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nother  fields  supported  by  the  Project  because  of  the  considerable  infrastructure  and  capital \nrequirements  and  the  prevailing  uncertainty.  At  present,  the  cost  of  private  sector  TEVT \nprograms  is  relatively  high  and  beyond  the  reach  of  the  poor.  The  public  sector  has  provided \nmost  TEVT  services  and  has  a  wide  provider  network.  It  was  therefore  decided  to  support \nexisting public sector providers and promote private\u2013public partnerships. To create an attractive \ncareer  path  in  the  TEVT  sector  as  a  serious  alternative  to  conventional  university  education, \nstate  intervention  will  be  needed.  By  establishing  Univotec  as  an  apex  body  and  positioning \nCoTs  as  provincial  resource  centers,  the  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  move  towards \nestablishing  a  coherent  TEVT  system  with  vertical  mobility.  As  part  of  the  registration  and \naccreditation processes, the Project will also examine the framework within which private TEVT \nprovision is takes place with a view to providing a more facilitating environment.  \n \nThere  are  several  public  TEVT  providers  which  already  offer  technological  and \n5. \ntechnician  courses  at  postsecondary  levels.  Instead  of  supporting  them,  six  TCs  under  DTET \nwere selected to be upgraded to CoTs under the Project. This approach was chosen because: \n(i) existing courses at postsecondary levels accept only GCE A/L qualified students, and are not \nopen to GCE ordinary level (O/L) qualified students who are more likely to consider a technician \ncareer. Programs at TCs have GCE O/L requirements or less, and hence are better positioned \nto  offer  technician  programs  for  students  with  the  aptitude  for  training;  and  (ii)  TCs  have  a \ncountrywide  network  with  37  colleges  distributed  across  provinces,  while  other  public  TEVT \nproviders,  in  addition  to  admitting  only  GCE  A/L  qualified  students,  conduct  technological  and \ntechnician courses mainly in the Colombo region and two other large urban areas. \n \n6. \nLabor Demand Analysis. Currently, the supply of TEVT services is very low in relation \nto  demand.  In  2003,  only  15.5%  of  the  total  labor  force  of  7.6  million  had  some  form  of \nvocational  training.3  According  to  a  labor  market  survey  in  2004,4  TEVT  graduates  constitute \nonly  around  7.1%  of  skilled  and  technical  labor  force  employed  in  the  204  surveyed \nestablishments. Faced with a limited supply of graduates from the TEVT sector, private sector \nindustries  train  employees  in-house  to  upgrade  their  skills.  Many  have  said  that  they  would \nprefer to hire technically qualified persons with a recognized diploma in technical education.  \n \n7. \nBased  on  industry  growth  projections,  labor  demand  for  different  occupations  and \nindustry  categories  was  estimated  for  2004\u20132007.  Only  15%  of  the  estimated  demand  for \ntechnicians  and  24%  for  skilled  workers  would  be  filled  during  2004-2007,  assuming  that  the \nsupply levels remain constant.5 Hence, there is an immense need to expand and diversify the \ncurrent  TEVT  system  in  order  to  fill  the  huge  supply\u2013demand  gap  for  technicians  and  skilled \nworkers.  \n \n8. \nThe  Project  will  support  CoTs  and  Univotec  to  produce  more  skilled  technologists  and \ntechnicians  in  selected  technologies.  Sufficient  industry  demand  for  these  graduates  is  a \nprerequisite for the economic viability of the Project. Technology fields to be offered at Univotec \nand the CoTs will primarily address domestic labor market needs. Addressing foreign demand \nwill be a secondary consideration. Up to four technology fields to be offered by each CoT were \nproposed during consultation workshops involving the public and private sectors.6 According to \nworkshop participants, the greatest demand is for skilled workers in (1) information technology, \n(2)  civil  engineering,  and  (3)  construction.  Thus,  information  and  communication  technology  is \n                                                 \n3  Table 6.1 in p.33, TVEC. 2004. Labor Market Information Bulletin, June 2004. \n4  The Survey was conducted in five districts and 11 industries under PPTA 4090-SRI: Human Resource Investment  \n    Project in 2004. \n5  The supply\u2013demand gaps are 71,000 for technicians and other associates; and 346,000 for skilled workers. \n6  Workshops were conducted on 25 February, 11, 18\u201320, and 31 March 2005. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                           Appendix 13 \n\n51\n\nproposed  to  be  offered  in  seven  out  of  the  nine  CoTs,  and  civil  technology,  including \nconstruction, in four. \n \n9. \nThere  is  also  foreign  demand  for  graduates  of  the  project  institutions.  There  are  about \n1 million Sri Lankan workers in foreign countries, who remitted $1.6 billion in foreign currency in \n2004.7 Foreign labor demand has continuously exceeded supply, especially for skilled workers \nand  technicians.  In  2004,  there  were  366,226  job  orders  from  foreign  countries,  of  which \n156,013  (42.6%)  were  filled.  For  technicians  and  associated  professional  categories  in  2004, \nout  of  11,180  job  orders,  only  2,273  (20%)  were  filled,  implying  a  large  number  of  missed \nearning  opportunities  during  the  period.  Since  the  foreign  jobs  for  technician  and  associated \nprofessionals offer much higher salaries than those for similar domestic jobs,8 if these positions \nare  filled  by  graduates  from  the  project  institutions  this  would  increase  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  foreign \nexchange earnings.   \n \n10. \nEconomic  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (EIRR).  To  quantify  the  economic  viability  of  the \nProject,  the  EIRR  over  15  years  was  estimated.  The  Project  will  start  three  streams  of  new \nprograms  at  technician  and  technologist  levels:  (i)  B.Tech.Ed.,  (ii)  B.Tech.  and  (iii)  Diploma  in \nTechnician  Education.  The  first  two  will  be  offered  by  Univotec,  and  the  diploma  program  by \nnine CoTs, six of which will be assisted by the Project.  \n \nThe  B.Tech.Ed.  program  will  train  instructors  and  lecturers,  who  will  in  turn  teach \n11. \ndiploma courses as well as some of the existing certificate level courses at CoTs. The benefits \nfrom the B.Tech.Ed. program will be reflected in: (i) increased labor productivity (and thus higher \nwages) of CoT graduates who are taught by better qualified instructors and lecturers; (ii) shorter \njob  search  times  as  a  result  of  better  learning  outcomes;  and  (iii) an  increase  in  internal \nefficiency  of  the  existing  certificate  level  courses  taught  by  instructors  and  lecturers  with \nB.Tech.Ed qualifications.  \n \nThe B.Tech. program will train students as technologists in various technologies, starting \n12. \nfrom the third year of project implementation, when there will be 200 full-time and 200 part-time \nstudents.  By  the  fifth  year  of  implementation,  the  program  intake  will  increase  to  600  full-time \nand  600  part-time  students.  Based  on  the  projected  number  and  the  employment  rate  of \ngraduates, the program will lead to better labor productivity and higher wages. Representative \nwage  structures  for  technologists  and  unskilled  workers  were  developed  from  the  industry \nsurvey and used as the bases for the benefits computation.9  \n \nThe Diploma in Technician Education programs will begin in the second year of project \n13. \nimplementation  with  an  intake  of  375  full-time  and  375  part-time  students  in  various \ntechnologies. By the fifth year of implementation, the intake will expand to a maximum of 1,500 \nfull-time  and  1,500  part  time  students.  The  benefit  from  the  DTET  programs  is  calculated  as \nincremental  wage  income  for  those  diploma  holders  employed  in  their  respective  technology \nfields.  \n \n14. \nproject \n\nThe economic cost of the Project includes: (i) the capital investment incurred during the \nthe  project \n\nrecurrent  costs  beyond \n\nimplementation  period, \n\nincremental \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n7  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2004.

In the low scenario, the employment rate, the promotion and \ncompletion  rates,  and  the  intake  rate  are  all  assumed  to  be  lower  than  the  base  scenario  by \n20%. In the high scenario, the employment rate is assumed to be higher than the base by 5%,11 \nthe promotion and completion rates higher by 5%, and the intake higher by 20% (Table A13.1). \nThe internal efficiency of the programs is the most sensitive parameter for the EIRR. Hence, it is \nimperative  to  ensure  that  students  stay  in  programs  and  complete  the  degree  and  diploma \nrequirements.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n\nItem \n\nEmployment rate of graduates \nPromotion/completion rate \nNumber of intake \nOne year delay in diploma programs CoTs \n\nHigh \n21.5 \n23.1 \n23.7 \n \n\nBase  \n20.4 \n20.4 \n20.4 \n20.4 \n\nLow \n16.1 \n  9.8 \n16.6 \n20.3 \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis \n\n                 CoT = college of technology.  \n                 Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  \n \n17. \nPoverty  in  Sri  Lanka  is  a  rural  phenomenon.  In  2002,  21%  of  the  rural  population  was \nclassified  as  poor,  compared  with  6%  of  urban  population.  The  Project  will  ensure  equity  in \naccess  to  TEVT  by  upgrading  one  TC  each  in  six  of  the  nine  provinces.12  Table  A13.2 \nsummarizes  income,  education,  and  employment  indicators  in  seven  provinces.  Across \nprovinces,  there  is  a  positive  correlation  between  the  average  income  and  tertiary  education \nenrollment rate and a negative correlation between the average income and the unemployment \nrate  for  the  population  with  A/L  qualifications.  Since  many  of  the  nonpoor  can  obtain \npostsecondary  education  at  fee-paying  private  institutions13  and  secure  white-collar  jobs \nafterwards, a large percentage of the unemployed population with A/L qualifications and those \nwho  cannot  pursue  further  education  at  the  postsecondary  level  are  likely  to  belong  to  poorer \nhouseholds. The project programs are expected to enroll students from the poorer households, \nwho would not otherwise be able to pursue postsecondary level education, and to equip them \nwith  income-earning  skills  upon  program  completion.  By  offering  programs  in  technologies \n\n                                                 \n10 SLRs12,000  per  annum  for  a  full-time  student  and  SLRs7,500  for  a  part-time  student  were  assumed  for  \n    out-of-pocket expenses. \n11 The employment rate cannot exceed 100%. \n12 Up to six colleges of technology (CoTs) will be supported by ADB and the rest will be supported by other donors, \nCooperation]  \n    including Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit [German Agency for   Technical \n    (GTZ), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Korean   International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).  \n13 Approximately  70%  of  tertiary  education  enrollment  is  in  the  private  sector.  Since  these  private  tertiary  are \n    expensive, there is a sharp disparity in tertiary education enrollment between the poor and non-poor. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                           Appendix 13 \n\n53\n\nneeded  locally,  the  Project  will  encourage  regional  growth  and  contribute  to  regional  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n\nTable A13.2: Income, Education, and Employment by Province \n \n\nItem\nPercentage below poverty linea\n\nAverage income per personb\n\nUnemployment for GCE AL qualifiedc\n\nTertiary education enrollment rated\n\nWestern\u2013\nMaradana\n9.2%\n\nSouthern\u2013 \nGalle\n23.6%\n\nSabaragamuwa\u2013 \nRathnapura\n28.9%\n\nCentral\u2013 \nKandy\n20.8%\n\nUva\u2013\nBadulla\n31.8%\n\nNorth Western\u2013 \nKurunegala\n22.3%\n\nNorth Central\u2013 \nAnarudhapura\n18.1%\n\nTotal\n19.2%\n\n4,187\n\n11.3%\n\n16.0%\n\n2,598\n\n19.7%\n\n10.0%\n\n2,036\n\n21.0%\n\n9.0%\n \n\n2,623\n\n19.2%\n\n8.0%\n\n2,528\n\n20.7%\n\n7.0%\n\n2,717\n\n17.0%\n\n7.0%\n\n2,437\n\n3,056\n\n24.0%\n\n16.5%\n\n6.0%\n\n11.0%  \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nA/L = advanced level, GCE = general certificate of education. \na The official poverty line is SLRs1,423 per month in 2002. \nb Monthly income in SLRs. \nSources: (a and b)\u2013Department of Census and Statistics. 2004.

Educational  institutions  find  it  difficult  to  expand  high-quality  programs, \nparticularly  at  the  postsecondary  level  and  in  the  TEVT  sector,  where  the  unit  cost  of  training \none technician or technologist is significantly higher than in the general education sector.  \n \n19. \nThe  Government\u2019s  share  in  the  project  costs  is  estimated  at  $6.7  million  during  the \nimplementation period. Public TEVT provision is the responsibility of the MSDVTE, which was \nformed in 2003. In Table A13.3, the annual shares of the Government in the Project costs are \ncompared  with  the  projected  MSDVTE  budgetary  allocations  for  the  years  2006\u20132011.

These  may  include \n(i) offering fee-levying short or part-time courses for employees in industries and (ii) expanding \nfee-levying weekend courses. In addition, the Project will review the rules and regulations of the \nGovernment and MSDVTE to identify responsibilities that could be decentralized to facilitate the \nefficiency  and  sustainability  of  training  programs;  train  senior  personnel  of  CoTs  in  strategic \nplanning, industry partnerships, and training needs assessments; and develop and implement a \nperformance-based budgeting system for the CoTs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                           Appendix 14 \n\n55\n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nThe technical education and vocational training (TEVT) sector in Sri Lanka comprises a diverse mix of study programs \noffered  by  the  Government,  private  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  catering  to  a  variety  of  target \ngroups, including the poor. There are about 1,421 TEVT institutions, with a total enrollment of about 64,000 trainees in \n2003. Of this number, a significant percentage of the unemployed urban and rural poor (60%) had acquired skills and \nfound  employment  opportunities  in  the  country  and  abroad.  The  rural  and  urban  poor  are  a  large  and  important \nsegment  of  the  population,  with  great  potential  to  contribute  to  the  future  economic  growth  of  the  country. \nThe  TEVT  sector  has  helped  to  reduce  poverty  in  several  ways.  It  provides  free  education  to  the  poor  in  technical \ncolleges  (TCs).  In  some  vocational  training  institutions,  such  as  the  National  Apprentice  and  Industrial  Training \nAuthority,  monthly  allowances  are  given  to  trainees  undergoing  practical  training  in  industry.  It  is  estimated  that  the \nhigh proportion of students who failed the General Certificate of Education (GCE) ordinary level (O/L) examination and \nare  school  dropouts  are  from  poor  households.  Since  they  have  a  limited  opportunity  to  continue  their  higher \neducation in private secondary education institutions, they tend to obtain alternate qualifications in the TEVT sector. \nSome recent studies show that 60% of the households of students in the TEVT sector received less than SLRs 6,000 \nper month. Students coming from poor households are mostly enrolled in basic skills development courses. The TEVT \nsector  also  helps  to  improve  the  skills  of  the  poor,  make  them  more  competitive,  and  enable  them  to  earn  a \nreasonable salary or wage. For example, semi-skilled and skilled workers, who also belong to poor households, have \nthe opportunity to continue to develop their skills and to earn higher salaries. The TEVT sector is expected to continue \nto train about 25,000 rural and urban youths from low-income families each year. This will sustain the positive impacts \nof the TEVT sector on the economy and on the lives of poor youths and their families by providing skills training and \nincreased access to job opportunities. \n \nThe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  has  given  high  priority  to  human  development  through  TEVT  in  order  to  produce  a \ncompetent  and  flexible  workforce  that  will  promote  social  and  economic  development  and  encourage  the  youth  to \ndevelop the best of their potential for economic and social development of the country. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) document, Poverty Reduction in Sri Lanka (2001), noted the lack of access to high-quality education among the \npoor. The Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between ADB and the Government of Sri Lanka, signed in March \n2002,  defines  the  nature  of  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  Government  for  economic  growth  and  human  resources \ndevelopment.  The  education  system,  including  TEVT,  must  play  a  vital  role  in  ensuring  that  the  nation  has  a \nproductive  workforce,  with  the  knowledge  and  the  skills  needed  by  the  economy.  ADB\u2019s  education  and  training \nstrategy  in  Sri  Lanka  is  part  of  its  overall  strategy  of  poverty  reduction,  human  development,  and  economic  growth. \nADB has provided support to the TEVT sector in Sri Lanka through three projects.   \n \nTEVT  in  Sri  Lanka  is  relatively  new  and  underdeveloped.  There  are  about  379  statutory  bodies,  209  government \ninstitutions,  350  private  institutions  and  128  NGO  institutions.  In  2003,  63,454  students  were  enrolled  in  vocational \ncourses  at  certificate  and  diploma  levels.  Although  annual  admissions  show  a  gradual  increase  in  the  student \npopulation, the dropout rate has increased from 21% to 26% over the last 6 years. This can be attributed to the low \nsocial  image  of  technical  education,  lack  of  proper  career  guidance  in  the  choice  of  courses,  the  poor  quality  of \ninstruction and of the training environment, and domestic instability. Despite the expansion of TEVT facilities in both \npublic  and  private  sectors,  the  intervention  of  the  government  is  required  to  promote  TEVT  as  an  alternative  career \npath  toward  more  rational  human  resource  development.  Each  year,  140,000  people  enter  the  job  market,  70%  of \nwhom  remain  unemployed.  Youth  unemployment  has  increased  because  of  a  lack  of  appropriate  skills  and \ncompetencies.  The  conventional  secondary  education  system,  with  its  traditional  courses,  does  not  cater  to  the \nemerging needs of the labor markets, especially in new technological areas. \n\nTEVT  in  Sri  Lanka  does  not  receive  high  recognition  among  students  and,  as  a  result,  enrollment  of  trainees  in  VT \ninstitutes  is  comparatively  low.  The  development  of  technical  education  at  diploma  and  degree  levels  creates  an \nopportunity  for  students  enrolled  in  basic  skills  development  courses  and  the  unemployed  to  obtain  TEVT \nqualifications.    Vocational  students  have  a  higher  tendency  to  get  into  higher  earning  jobs  in  industry.  The  social \nprofile of such students  indicates  that most prefer to continue their education and training while they are employed as \nthey have to  continue supporting themselves and their families. New forms of tertiary education would enable more \npoor students to become qualified, including higher diplomas and degrees. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n       Appendix 14 \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nFor the last two decades there has been high international demand for Sri Lankan labor, but the country has not been \nable to cater to some labor market requirements. Hence, the Project will focus on strengthening the Ministry of Skills \nDevelopment, Vocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE) and the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission \n(TVEC)  as  the  sector\u2019s  apex  bodies,  and  establish  provincial  colleges  of  technology  (CoTs)  and  the  University  of \nVocational  Technology  (Univotec)  to  reduce  the  skills  mismatch.  Alternative  forms  of  tertiary  education  and  vertical \nmobility  will  offer  better  education  and  training  opportunities  to  students  from  economically  disadvantaged \ncommunities. \n  \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nUsing the 2003 human development index, Sri Lanka was ranked 93rd of 175 countries. Sri Lanka has had a history of \nwelfare interventions, which have contributed much to social development. According to the 2003 household income \nand expenditure survey, 24.7% in the rural sector, 7.9% in the urban sector, and 22.1% in the estate sector live below \nthe  poverty  line.  The  regions  with  high  levels  of  poverty  are  those  with  low  access  to  public  services  and  low \nachievements as measured by human development indicators. Of the nine provinces where the proposed CoTs are to \nbe  established,  poverty  is  high  in  Uva,  Sabaragamuwa,  North  Central,  North  and  Eastern  Provinces.  In  these \nprovinces  most  people  live  in  rural  areas.  Sabaragamuwa  has  the  highest  level  of  poverty  (28.9%)  and  Western \nprovince  the  lowest  (9.2%).  In  the  other  districts  where  the  proposed  CoTs  will  be  established,  Badulla  and \nRathnapura  have  most  poor  households.  The  proportion  of  persons  engaged  in  small  industries  is  lower  in  Badulla \nthan in Rathnapura. Consumption poverty is lower in urban areas than in rural areas. Urban residents tend to receive \nregular  incomes  from  several  household  members  and  to  have  access  to  welfare  services.  In  rural  areas,  many \npeople live on estates (mostly tea estates), which are isolated and have poor housing and education facilities.  \n \nAn  inverse  relationship  exists  between  the  poverty  level  and  the  extent  of  urbanization--the  more  urbanized  the \nprovince is, the lower is its poverty level. For example, the most urbanized Western and Southern Provinces have the \nlowest  poverty  levels,  and  the  least  urbanized  Uva  and  North-Western  Provinces  have  the  highest.  This  points  to  a \npositive relationship between sources of income and the level of poverty. People who earn a higher proportion of their \nincome from nonfarm employment are wealthier than people who earn most of their income from agriculture. This also \nimplies  more  urbanized  and  industrialized  areas  are  more  affluent  than  those  that  have  remained  predominantly \nagricultural. An inverse a relationship exists between the level of poverty and the level of education. The incidence of \npoverty  is  highest  among  individuals  in  households  where  the  principal  income  earner  has  no  schooling  (58%)  and \nlowest  among  households  where  the  principal  income-earner  is  a  graduate  (5%).  Substantial  variations  in \nconsumption poverty can be seen across districts, with the same relationships between the extent of poverty and the \ndegree  of  urbanization  and  the  level  of  education  of  household  members.  Overall,  poverty  is  high  in  districts  where \nagricultural development has been low and the expansion of industrial and commercial activities has been sluggish.      \n \nIn most rural areas, access to vocational training is limited. Most of the vocational training centers conduct traditional \ncourses despite the ADB Skill Development Project (Loan 1707-SRI) having initiated the introduction of competency-\nbased training (CBT) system. The shortage of trained instructors and lecturers is a major problem at the local level. \nCraft level students do not have much scope to upgrade their knowledge and competencies through higher TEVT to \naccess technical and managerial level jobs within the country or abroad.  Trainees in the TEVT sector tend to have \nlow salaries as a result they do not pursue higher education in the vocational training sector. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nDuring  the  project  preparation  phase,  participatory  consultations  were  held  with  different  stakeholders  at  the  policy-\nmaking level, representatives of organizations providing vocational training, local communities, private sector, staff of \nthe ongoing Skills development Project, MSDVTE officials, and students. Discussions were held with stakeholders at \nthe  regional  level  to  identify  courses  that  take  into  consideration  labor  market  demands.  Industrial  specialists  were \nconsulted  for  information  on  training  needs  and  employment  opportunities.  At  a  national  workshop  the  draft  project \nfeasibility study was presented to key stakeholders and their comments and concerns were addressed. In addition, the \nsteering committee, chaired by the Secretary of MSDVTE, met at least three times to discuss the design of the project \nin the context of the current government\u2019s national policies.  \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                           Appendix 14 \n\n57\n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\nGender Development \n\n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe Project includes the participation of industry and employers, key stakeholders of the TEVT sector, to ensure the \nquality and relevance of training programs. TVEC will be strengthened to work with industry and employers. Industry \nsector  councils  will  be  established  to  help  develop  and  validate  program  and  training  standards  in  selected \ntechnologies  and  craft-level  programs.  Advisory  councils  in  CoTs  will  assist  senior  CoT  administrators  to  determine \nthe  direction  of  its  training  programs.  In  CoTs,  sectoral  councils  will  validate  curricula.  Senior  CoT  personnel  will \nengage stakeholders in the planning, administration, and implementation of training programs that are responsive to \nindustry\u2019s needs.  \n \n \nD. \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nSri Lanka provides free primary, secondary, and tertiary education in an extensive public school system and a network \nof  vocational  and  technical  education  institutions  throughout  the  country.  Incentives,  such  as  scholarships,  are  also \nprovided.  Women  have  a  high  educational  attainment  and  there  is  gender  equality  in  access  to  general  education. \nTheir  high  educational  attainment  has  partly  contributed  to  the  increase  in  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  labor  force. \nBetween 1981 and 2001, the share of women in the labor force increased from 18% to 34%.  \n \nHowever,  despite  these  achievements,  social  biases  in  career  choices  are  still  apparent  and  are  reflected  in \nenrollments  in  TEVT  programs.  Although  women  comprised  37%  of  the  total  enrollment  in  TCs  in  2003,  they  were \nmainly  enrolled  on  commerce  and  secretarial  courses.  The  number  of  female  students  in  trades  courses,  such  as \nelectronics, automobile repairs, carpentry, masonry, welding and motor mechanics, is low. Women comprise less than \n25% of the enrollment in technical courses.  \n \nThere is a need to encourage more women into technical education. A social marketing program would be useful and \nnew technology courses may also present new opportunities. Attracting more women to less \u201cfeminine\u201d courses would \nalso improve their access to higher paying jobs locally and abroad. Although  women comprised 72% of people  who \nmigrated  for  foreign  employment  in  2002,  most  were  employed  as  housemaids,  where  they  received  low  incomes, \nexperienced job insecurity, and worked in poor conditions.  \n \nThe Project includes the following strategies to address gender issues: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nIn the overall social marketing strategy, the gender dimensions of TEVT will be emphasized. Career \nguidance  components  will  raise  awareness  of  a  technical  and  technological  career  path,  with  a \nspecial focus in promoting female enrollment in the TEVT sector.  \nWithin the first year of project implementation, MSDVTE will develop and approve a policy and an \naction  plan  emphasizing  the  need  for  a  gender-sensitive  environment  and  for  women  to  be \nencouraged  to  enroll  in  trades,  technician,  and  technologist  programs.  The  policy  and  action  plan \nwill  address  issues  such  as  student  selection  and  allocation  criteria,  subsidy,  and  scholarship \nprograms, and awareness-raising activities within the first year of project implementation.  \nEach  CoT  and  the  university  will  appoint  a  gender  coordinator  to  oversee  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the gender policy. \nThe project implementation unit (PIU), MSDVTE, TVEC, each CoT, and Univotec will collect project \nbaseline  gender-disaggregated  data,  and,  thereafter,  regularly  collect  and  maintain  gender-\ndisaggregated data in its database.  \nThe PIU, in cooperation with TVEC, the CoTs and Univotec will regularly analyze project output and \nimpact indicators, including by gender.  \nAs new technician programs are introduced, the CoTs will, at minimum, maintain the gender ratio of \nits 2004 enrollment as a TC (about 37%). \nEach  CoT  and  the  university  will  maintain  gender-sensitive  infrastructure  facilities,  which  will \nenhance the learning environment of female students.   \nInstructors and lecturers will undertake gender-sensitization training.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n.  \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n       Appendix 14 \n\nE.
