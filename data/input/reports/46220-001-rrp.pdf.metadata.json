By  focusing  on  critical  expenditures,  sustainability,  and  life  cycle  costing, \ninvestments  in  the  two  sectors  will  become  financially  more  viable.  The  risks  will  be  more \nequitably shared when investments are made through public\u2013private partnerships. Users of the \nroads  and  drinking  water  supply  will  benefit  from  enhanced  and  sustainable  services,  and \ntaxpayers will get better value for money and greater benefits from their taxes. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nEconomic  growth  facilitated  by  improved  infrastructure  is  a  government  development \n3. \npriority. 3  Infrastructure  assets  are  deteriorating  fast  in  Armenia,  and  resources  for  their \nrehabilitation  or  replacement  are  limited,  as  confirmed  during  the  program  design  phase.4 The \nroad and water sectors are particularly important, given their impact on the economy and quality \nof life. Under-provision or poor provision of roads limits people\u2019s access to markets, health, and \neducation  facilities.  Better  maintained  road  networks  around  economic  hubs  can  improve \naccess and create opportunities for economic integration for those in peri-urban and rural areas. \nReliable access to clean water is an important factor for household well-being. \n \n4. \nArmenia  is  a  landlocked,  mountainous  country  with  an  extensive  road  network  that  is \nunderfunded  and  of  poor  quality.  Frequent  seismic  activity  and  sharp  seasonal  temperature \nvariations  adversely  affect  road  conditions,  construction,  and  maintenance.  The  country  has \nabout  7,700  kilometers  of  republic,  interstate,  and  local  roads.  About  3,500  kilometers  of  the \nnetwork are managed by the central government, while the maintenance of the rest is delegated \nto  the  severely  resource-constrained  marzes  and  local  communities. 5   There  is  inadequate \ninformation  to  make  sound  sector  and  investment  decisions  for  more  than  half  of  the  republic \nroads.  Available  qualitative  information  about  roads  managed  by  local  communities  is \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   As  per  ADB's  project  classification  system,  the  program  will  target  the  following  sectors,  in  addition  to  public \nmanagement: (i)  transport  and  (ii)  water  and  other  urban infrastructure  and services.  Under  the  transport sector, \nroad  transport  (non-urban),  urban  roads,  and  transport  policies  and  institutional  development  are  the  subsectors \nthat will be addressed. Under the water sector, urban policy, institutional and capacity development, and the urban \nwater  supply  are  the  subsectors  that  will  be  targeted.  This  classification  has  been  reflected  in  the  Program  at  a \nGlance page. For brevity and clarity in this report, the \"road sector\" and \"water sector\" will be used in reference to \nthese subsectors. \n\n3   Government of Armenia. 2008.

In  the  absence  of  data,  it  is  difficult  to  monitor  how  efficiently  the  roads  are \nmaintained by public and private service providers. \n \n5. \nArmenia\u2019s  road  asset  ownership,  management,  and  regulatory  structures  are \nsegmented.  The  country  has  more  than  500  national,  regional,  and  local  road  managers  with \ndifferent  levels  of  expertise  and  capacity.  This  creates  operational  and  management  issues, \nundermines economies of scale, and limits value optimization in sector investments. The central \nbudget allocation for capital expenditure on roads, funded mainly by international development \nassistance,  cannot  meet  the  demand.  The  distortion  between  capital  expenditures  and  the \noperating  budget  is  also  increasing.  Sector  analyses  indicate  about  1%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP)  is  required to maintain  the road  network  in its  current  condition,  but  only  about \n0.25%  of  GDP  ($25  million  a  year)  is  budgeted  for  operation  and  maintenance.  ADB,  the \nEuropean  Investment  Bank,  and  the World  Bank  have  invested  more  than  $500  million  in  the \nroad sector  since  2000.6 However,  the road  maintenance  budget  allocations declined  because \nof  post-2009  fiscal  constraints,  the  block  allocations  for  new  road  construction,  and  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  shortfalls.  Four  key  issues  need  to  be  addressed  to  improve \nroad  sector  effectiveness\u2014insufficient  technical  information,  fragmented  sector  management, \nlack of a sector regulator, and inadequate funding to achieve sustainable service delivery. \n \n6. \nAfter Armenia became independent in 1991, most of its water and wastewater systems \nwere  in  poor  condition  because  of  limited  financial  and  management  capacity.  Technical  and \ncommercial water losses exceeded 85%; most households received less than 5 hours of water \na  day.  Since  2000  the  government  has  restructured  the  water  sector,  awarding  lease  and \nmanagement  contracts  to  private  water  operators.  Substantial  investments,  supported  by \ndevelopment  agencies,  have  been  made  to  improve  the  system.  Despite  improvements  in  the \nduration  and  quality  of  water  for  two-thirds  of  the  population  on  the  main grid,  key  challenges \nremain.  About  560  communities  in  rural  and  peri-urban  areas  are  not  connected  to  the  grid. \nInitial assessments indicate that about half of the existing network needs renovation, and 40,000 \nrural  inhabitants  do  not  have  access  to  piped  water  supply.  In  2008,  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  estimated  that  about  $100  million  in  water \nand  sanitation  investments  are  needed  for  rural  areas.7 The  capital  investment  needs  for  the \nmain water supply grid for the next 5 years are estimated at about $279 million, or 2.8% of GDP.  \n \n7. \nThe  Public  Services  Regulatory  Commission  (PSRC)  regulates  the  water  sector.  All \npublic  and  private  owners  of  water  assets  are  subject  to  the  same  regulatory  regime  under \nPSRC.  Five  private  operators  manage  the  drinking  water  supply  on  behalf  of  the  government \nthrough  lease  or  management  contracts.  The  State  Committee  on  Water  Economy  (SCWE), \npart  of  the  Ministry  of  Territorial  Administration  (MTA),  carries  out  the  policy,  strategy,  and \nstandards  functions.  However,  the  regulatory  activities  of  PSRC  and  SCWE  are  not  fully \ndelineated.  The  separation  of  policy  from  operational  management  and  regulation,  while \ncredible, does not address operational and financial inefficiencies. Water sector management is \nhampered  by  (i)  the  lack  of  a  consolidated,  complete,  and  current  asset  database  to  inform \ninvestment  decisions,  and  (ii)  weak  government  engagement  with  the  private  operators  that \nmanage water assets. Financial support to the water sector is not explicitly stated in the budget \nbecause  financial  reporting  practices  in  the  sector  are  irregular  or  incomplete.  The  sector  is \nmarked  by  weak  public  and  financial  management  systems.  The  water  sector  needs  (i)  a \n\n                                                \n6  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7   OECD and Environmental Action Programme Task Force. 2008.

Areas for early attention include (i) streamlined \ninstitutional  framework  for  policy,  regulation,  asset  management,  service  delivery,  and  dispute \nresolution functions; (ii) sector-wide strategies for tariffs, metering, nonrevenue water, and asset \nmanagement  and maintenance;  and (iii) system and capacity  enhancements for more  efficient \nplanning, budgeting, procurement, contract management, and allocative efficiency.  \n \nThe government has been working with development agencies and the private sector to \n9. \nimprove  road  and  water  supply \ninvestment  and \nmaintenance  needs  far  exceed  the  resources  available.  In  addition,  the  current  systems  can \nbenefit from significant efficiency enhancements to receive better value from expenditures. Both \nsectors  are  acutely  underfunded,  and  the  government\u2019s  long-term  planning  and  sector \nmanagement capacity is limited. Improved sector management and service delivery in road and \nwater supply requires (i) integrated sector management informed by sound asset management; \n(ii) effective financial management and additional financing options; and (iii) aligned department \nand  agency  responsibilities,  functions,  and  accountabilities  to  help  achieve  targets  in  each \nsector.  These  findings  echo  the  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  initiatives  in  the  road  and  water \nsectors, the country programming, and other development partners\u2019 experiences in Armenia. \n \n10. \nThe  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  development  agenda  on  sustainable \ninfrastructure  provision  as  articulated  in  the  Armenia  Development  Strategy  2014\u20132025;  the \nMedium-Term  Expenditure  Framework,  2014\u20132016;  and the  Republic  of Armenia Government \nProgram.8 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020; the Water Operational \nPlan,  2011\u20132020;  the  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  Operational  Plan;  and  the  development \npriorities  identified  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016. 9  The  program  will \nintroduce  a  cross-sector  approach,  where  sector  and  finance  ministries  collaborate  at  all  four \nlevels of results-based management\u2014planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring. To \nsupport  the  reforms,  ADB  will  partner  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  for  optimal  resource \nmobilization,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communication  (MOTC)  for  the  national  road \nnetwork, MTA for regional coordination, and PSRC and SCWE for drinking water supply. These \nimplementing agencies will undertake the institutional and policy reforms detailed in the design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nThe  core  development  challenge  has  been  the  limited  impact  that  sector  investments, \n11. \ndelivered  through  the  sector  agencies,  have  had  on  Armenia\u2019s  road  and  water  sector \nsustainability.  Finance,  water,  road,  and  regulatory  agencies  will  be  equally  engaged  in  this \nprogram\u2019s  results.  The  program  will  complement  sector  interventions  by  ADB  and  other \n                                                \n8   Government  of  Armenia.  2012.

The program will provide a more \nintegrated  approach  and  an  opportunity  to undertake  deeper,  more  sustainable  reforms  in the \ntwo sectors. The policy matrix in Appendix 4 sets forth the preconditions for the release of two \ntranches under the loan. The program was designed in close coordination with the development \npartners  that  support  Armenia\u2019s  road,  water,  and  public  management  sectors,  including  the \nEuropean  Union,  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nInternationale  Zusammenarbeit  and  KfW, \nInternational \nDevelopment, and the World Bank to optimize synergies and avoid duplication.10 The program \nteam\u2019s  findings  were  regularly  shared  with  civil  society,  service  user  organizations,  public  and \nprivate service providers, academia, and development partners during the design phase through \nworkshops,  seminars,  and  bilateral  meetings.  These  stakeholders  were  then  consulted \nspecifically  on  the  importance,  relevance,  and  achievability  of  the  proposed  reforms,  and  their \nfeedback  was  incorporated  in  the  program  design.  This  participatory  approach  will  continue \nduring loan implementation to ensure program results are achieved as Armenia\u2019s development \nneeds evolve.  \n \nB. \n\nthe  United  States  Agency \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nfor \n\n12. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  service  delivery  in  the  road  transport  and  water  supply \nsectors.

The segmented sector structure is \na common binding constraint for the two sectors. To enable informed and efficient management \nof the road sector,  the  program  will  support  the government  in  establishing  a road council  (an \nMOTC-led,  multi-agency  advisory  body  for  coordination  of  road  maintenance  policies  and \ninvestment  decisions  across  the  country).  The  road  council  will  comprise  management \nrepresentatives \nterritorial \nadministration (which coordinates regional infrastructure), and other ministries and agencies as \nrequired. MTA will lead a multi-agency working group, which will review the roles of key water \nsector  agencies  to  align  their  responsibilities  and  functions  more  effectively.  Results  of  this \nreview will inform the preparation of Armenia\u2019s next water sector strategy with a financing plan. \nThe Water Code 2002 and related legal acts will be aligned with the new water sector strategy \nto provide the required legal guidance for the developing sector. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Strategies  and  processes  to  allocate  investments  more  efficiently \ndeveloped.  The  government  will  adopt  a  financing  strategy  for  road  maintenance  and \nimplement it from 2015 onwards through a participatory process. The road council will, as part \nof  its  coordinating  function,  validate  road  maintenance  expenditures,  which  will  be  developed \nbased  on  road  asset  management  principles.  Quantitative  and  qualitative  performance \nindicators  will  be  included  in  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF),  2015\u20132017  for \nboth  the  road  and  water  sectors  to  institutionalize  results  monitoring.  To  improve  financial \nplanning,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  the  water  sector,  the  government  will  (i) fully \nexercise its shareholder role by requiring transparent and complete financial reports from water \n\n                                                \n10   Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nsector operators and by using this information for financial planning, and (ii) explicitly state the \namounts and objectives of water sector subsidies in budget publications. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Regulatory frameworks improved. Sector development targets may be met \nmore  consistently  in  the  long  run  if  the  sector  is  regulated  according  to  clearly  defined \nstandards. To  improve  service standards  and better  safeguard  user  rights,  MOTC\u2019s  regulatory \nmandate  will  be  defined  for  Armenia\u2019s  entire  road  network,  including  state,  republic,  and  local \nroads.  MOTC  will  establish  a  regulatory  department  to  carry  out  this  mandate.  Furthermore, \nMOTC will adopt a streamlined system to receive feedback from users and redress grievances. \nIt  will  be  implemented  by  the  regulatory  department.  PSRC,  which  regulates  the  water  sector, \nwill adopt a similar system to address water user concerns and service delivery failures. \n \nOutput 4: Monitoring systems strengthened. Regulatory systems are only as good as \n16. \nthe  results  they  generate,  which  should  be  monitored  through  complete,  verifiable,  up-to-date \ninformation systems on assets and financial positions.  A geo-referenced video inventory of the \ncountry\u2019s road network will be completed during the program period. For better informed policy \nand  investment  decision  making,  international  roughness  index  of  all  roads  will  be  monitored \nannually. To improve oversight of drinking water supply assets, SCWE will implement an asset \nmanagement system and improve information sharing between the public and private agencies. \nThe  internal  audit  capacity  within  the  key  counterpart  agencies  will  be  developed  to  support \nbetter  links  between  budget  and  audit,  as  well  as  between  audit  reports  and  policy  decisions. \nRegularly updated performance data will better inform policy and financial decisions; they will be \nshared  with  key  stakeholders  in  a  timely  manner  to  keep  beneficiaries  engaged  in  ensuring \nservice quality. MOTC, PSRC, and SCWE will develop and implement public information plans \nto increase accountability, improve customer service, and enable better informed and broader-\nbased public engagement with the service providers.  \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR \n31,770,000 ($49,000,000  equivalent) from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help finance the \nprogram.11 The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest \nrate  of  2.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the \nfull  exchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. \n \n18. \nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches,  subject  to  compliance  with  the  agreed-upon \ntranche  release  conditions  in  Appendix  4.  The  first  tranche  in  the  amount  of  SDR12,967,000 \n($20  million  equivalent)  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness;  the  second  tranche  in  the \namount  of  SDR  18,803,000  ($29  million  equivalent)  is  expected  to  be  released  in  the  third \nquarter of 2015. The loan size and tranche amounts are justified by (i) the nature and sequence \nof  reforms  that  are  required;  (ii)  cost  of  implementing  these  reforms;  (iii)  the  government\u2019s \nresources for development expenditure and financing needs (Table 1); and (iv) the time required \nto undertake the reforms.  \n \n19. \n\nThe 2009 economic crisis and the countercyclical fiscal package increased the financing \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n                                                \n11  The government\u2019s Development Policy Letter is in Appendix 3. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ngap. The public debt-to-GDP ratio jumped from 16.4% in 2008 to 43.6%  in 2013.12 Public debt \nservice is projected to continue its upward trend. The government\u2019s fiscal consolidation process, \ninitiated  after  the  economic  recovery  of  2010\u20132011,  reduced  the  budget  deficit  from  7.6%  of \nGDP in 2009 to 1.5% in 2012 and 0.4% in 2013. A new package of tax amendments for excise, \nincome, and mining taxes was approved in 2012. The package aims to increase revenues, thus \nenabling  higher  public  expenditures  for  development.  The  planned  budget  deficit  for  2014  is \n2.3% of GDP, and is projected to be 2.0% of GDP in 2015.13 The government expects to reduce \nthe budget deficit despite the 8% rise in public spending, largely because of higher public sector \nsalaries and pensions envisaged in 2014.14 \n \n\nTable 1: State Budget Financing Gap for 2013, 2014 (Planned), 2015 (Projected)  \n\nItem \n1.

The  largest  development  expenditure \nitem is social protection at 6.9% of GDP in 2013, 7.7% in 2014, and 7.6% in 2015. Expenditure \non  transport,  road network,  and communication and on  housing  and public  utilities constituted \n2.6%  of  GDP  in  2013  and  is  planned  to  be  1.9%  in  2014  and  2.1%  in  2015  (Table  1). \nExpenditure  on  water  was  about  0.5%  of  GDP  for  2013,  a  level  that  is  expected  to  be \nmaintained  in  2014.15 Expenditure  for  transport,  road  network,  and  communication  was  about \n1.4%  of  GDP  in  2013  and  is  expected  to  be  about  1.5%  of  GDP  in  2014.

Improvements in policy and operational systems are expected to \ncreate fiscal space, reduce the financing gap with prudent financial management, and improve \nthe value-for-money of road investments through better prioritization and monitoring of results. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n21.  MOF  is  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing  agencies are  the  MOF,  MOTC,  MTA, \nPSRC,  and  SCWE  with the  responsibilities described in para.  10  and  the  program  design  and \nmonitoring framework in Appendix 1. A steering committee, chaired by the executive director of \nthe  Foreign  Financing  Project  Management  Center  in  MOF  and  comprising  working-level \nimplementing  agency  representatives,  will  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  of  program \nactivities. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to Armenia as the borrower in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans.16 The program implementation period is from November 2013 to September 2015. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n22. \nThe Capacity Development TA for Strengthening Sector Management Capacity in Road \nand Water Sectors will be attached to the loan to support the government in effective and timely \nimplementation  of  tranche  2  policy  actions.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,000,000,  of  which \n$900,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nother  sources).  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  office, \nadministrative  and  logistics  support,  interpretation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  It  will  be \nimplemented  from  TA  effectiveness,  expected  to  be  in  November  2014,  to  September  2015. \nMOF will be the executing agency and ADB will oversee implementation.17 \n \nThe TA outputs will include (i) a consolidated drinking water supply sector strategy with a \n23. \nfinancing  plan  for  Armenia;  (ii)  draft  amendments  to  align  relevant  legislation  with  the  drinking \nwater  supply  sector  strategy;  and  (iii)  a  financing  strategy  for  road  maintenance.  The  TA  will \nalso provide training and technical advice to MOF, MOTC, SCWE, and PSRC to (i) implement \nresults-based  budgeting  in  water  and  roads,  including  development  and  analysis  of  key \nperformance  indicators  (KPIs);  (ii)  disseminate  and  implement  the  public  information  plans  for \nroad and water users; (iii) develop and manage the water asset register; and (iv) prepare risk-\nbased audit plans and conduct performance audits in the two sectors. \n \n24. \nThe TA will require 16 person-months of international and 34 person-months of national \nconsulting  services  through  short-term  and  co-sourcing  arrangements.18 The  government  has \nwelcomed  co-sourcing  as  it  will  allow  for  on-site  and  longer-term  engagement  of  experts  for \nknowledge and skills transfer rather than capacity substitution by consultants, as has been the \ncase to date. The team of international and national consultants will consist of (i) public financial \nmanagement  specialists,  (ii)  road  transport  and  water  supply  economists,  (iii)  a  public  utilities \nregulatory  affairs  specialist,  (iv)  water  sector  engineers,  (v)  road  engineers,  (vi)  a  data  and \nsystems  management  specialist,  (vii)  internal  audit  specialists,  and  (viii)  a  legal  expert.

Manila. \n17   Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18   Co-sourcing involves combining services from within and outside a business to achieve the same goal. In this case, \nit refers to technical experts working with experts in counterpart agencies to deliver certain outputs and expedite \nthe capacity transfer process. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ninternal audit specialists will be recruited through an audit firm. International consultants will be \nrecruited through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 \nand  simplified  technical  proposals.  National  consultants  will  be  engaged  individually  since  the \nrequired  qualifications  are  diverse  and  difficult  to  source  from  one  consulting  firm.  The \nconsultants will prepare regular progress reports, and TA deliverables will be made available in \nArmenian and English. All consultants and resource persons will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ndisbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nPublic  financial  management  and  economic  analysis  of  Armenia  have  been  conducted \nas part of the loan design background work and the upcoming country partnership strategy. The \nidentified  gaps  have  been  incorporated  into  the  program  design,  including  the  importance  of \nprudent financial management as well as adequate resources for a sustainable road network.  \n \n26.  Water sector financial assessments indicated that water and trading losses are high, and \ntariffs  fall  short  of  full  cost  recovery.  Water  operators  receive  21%  of  their  annual  income  as \nexplicit  and  implicit  subsidies  from  the  government  and  bilateral  assistance  to  Armenia  from \nFrance  and Germany.  The  financial  losses  accumulated  until  2013  were  about  $75 million,  or \n0.75%  of  GDP.  Greater  transparency  in  public  subsidies,  tariff  calculation,  technical  and \nfinancial losses, and the overall financial situation of the water sector is expected to increase the \nincentives  for  water  companies  to  reduce  water  losses.  This  can  reduce  the  size  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s annual (explicit and implicit) subsidy to the sector\u2014estimated at 0.1% of GDP\u2014\nand  free  resources  for  regular  maintenance,  repair,  and  upgrading  of  infrastructure,  thus \nimproving service provision to the population.19 The introduction of a consolidated water assets \nregister will increase the information available for investment planning. \n \n27. \nImproved qualitative and quantitative KPIs for the road and water sectors in the budget \nprocess are expected to result in more efficient budget allocations. The KPIs have been linked \nwith  the  planning  and  budgeting  processes  during  the  program  preparatory  phase,  as \ndemonstrated in the MTEF, 2014\u201316 and the 2014 Budget Law. The link between the KPIs and \nthe  implementation  and  monitoring  processes  will  be  further  strengthened  during  the  program \nperiod.  Risk-based  performance  audits  and  better  qualified  auditors  will  improve  the  quality  of \naudits. The appointment of independent non-executive members to the MOTC and SCWE audit \ncommittees  (including  from  civil  society  organizations)  will  further  strengthen  the  internal  audit \nsystem. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nThe  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  financial  management  is  developing. \nManagement  of  treasury  operations  has  improved,  with  almost  all  government  expenditures \ngoing  through  a  single  account.  Armenia  has  adopted  the  Law  on  Internal  Audit  based  on \ninternational good practice, and the establishment of internal audit departments and committees \n\n                                                \n19   Yerevan  Djur  is  using  its  own  resources  to  finance  40%  of  the  regular  maintenance,  repair,  and  upgrading  of \n\nwater infrastructure, while the other utilities are heavily dependent on development partner financing. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nin sector agencies is under way. Program budgeting reforms are ongoing. The Budget System \nLaw  was  adopted,  with  a  coding  system  for  program-based  budget  classifications.  Budget \nreporting  remains  largely  input-oriented.  The  Law  on  Internal  Audit  has  not  been  fully \nimplemented because of weak capacity in the Ministry of Finance and in the internal audit units. \nA  weak  internal  control  environment  can  lead  to  fiduciary  risks.  The  program  will  help  build \nplanning,  budgeting,  performance,  and  financial  monitoring  capacity  in  the  two  sectors  to \nstrengthen the public financial management and internal control environment. \n \nArmenia has improved the legal and institutional frameworks for public procurement. The \n29. \nProcurement Law went into effect on 1 January 2005, leading to the introduction of procurement \nprocedures.  The  Road  Map  for  Finalizing  e-Procurement  Reform  in  the  Republic  of  Armenia, \n2013\u20132015 was adopted, and a procurement support center was established in 2013 to review \nprocurement  processes  and  provide  procurement  training  and  advice.  However,  the  center\u2019s \ncapacity is limited. The transparency of procurement has improved since 2011 with tender and \nprocurement  announcements  made \nthe \nengagement of the procurement appeals council. The oversight of contracting arrangements in \nroad and water supply sectors need to be restructured and strengthened to align the incentives \nof  the  government  and  contractors.  The  program  will  help  upgrade  procurement  outcomes  by \nimproving contract oversight.  \n \nThe  government\u2019s  efforts  to  fight  corruption  have  had  limited  success.  The  Anti-\n30. \nCorruption  Monitoring  Commission,  set  up  in  2009,  oversaw  the  implementation  of  the  Anti-\nCorruption Strategy and Action Plan, 2009\u20132012. The Anti-Corruption Council is responsible for \napproving  anticorruption  policies  and  coordinating  related  activities.  However,  it  has  not \nproduced  a  report  since  2011.  The  program  will  help  strengthen  transparency  in  public \nexpenditure.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and MOF.  \n \nC. \n\nthrough  media  outlets  and \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ninternet,  and \n\nthe \n\n31. \nThe program is expected to have a positive indirect impact on the poor and nonpoor as it \nwill strengthen the efficiency, predictability, and transparency of public resource allocations and \nuse  in  the  road  and  water  sectors.  Efficiency  gains  from  better  resource  and  expenditure \nmanagement in these sectors will improve the quality, coverage, and delivery of public services. \nBetter-maintained  road  networks  will  increase  access  and  create  more  opportunities  for \neconomic  and  social  integration.  A  better  managed  and  regulated  water  network  will  broaden \nthe beneficiary base and improve service quality. Sector-specific, time-bound public information \nplans and diligently implemented grievance redress mechanisms will better inform and empower \nroad and water users. Program characteristics are not amenable to gender design. No adverse \nimpact on poor and vulnerable groups from the policy reforms is envisaged under the program.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nThe program supports policy reforms and institutional and capacity strengthening in road \nand water  sector  management.  In compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nthe  program  is  classified  under  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nprogram are expected to outweigh the costs with the existing mitigating measures. \n\n \nTable 2: Summary of Major Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nTA  is  attached  to  the  program  to  build  capacity  and \nimprove  budgetary  and  management  skills  in  these \nagencies. \n\nRisks \nDifferent  levels  of  capacity  in  MOTC,  SCWE,  MTA, \nand MOF to implement budget  processes may delay \nadoption  of \nthe \ntransport and water supply sectors. \nLack  of  consensus  on  reforms  might  delay  program \nimplementation. \n\nresults-based  management \n\nin \n\nBudget  planning  is  not  linked  to  performance;  asset \nmonitoring and internal audit practices are not able to \nprevent fiduciary risks. \nWeak \nincluding performance-based ones. \n\nimplementation  of  procurement  contracts, \n\nThe legal and regulatory framework for anticorruption \nis  adequate  but  implementation  is  weak,  which \nreduces the incentives to fight corruption. \n\nincluding  professional  and  advocacy \nStakeholders, \ngroups,  service  providers,  and  users  were  consulted \nduring  program  design.
