It will \nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  51.5  kilometers  (km)  of  the  two-lane  M6  highway  from  Vanadzor  in \nArmenia to the  border  with Georgia at  Bagratashen,  improve facilities and safety  along and  in \nthe vicinity of this road section in northern Armenia, and strengthen the institutional capacity of \nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC).2 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nRegional  integration  and  transport  infrastructure  needs.  Armenia  is  a  landlocked \ncountry in the South Caucasus region located at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western \nAsia.  Armenia  has  distinctive  economic  and  geographic  features  that  pose  considerable \ntransport challenges. Armenia shares borders with four countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and \nTurkey. However, only the southern border with Iran and the northern border with Georgia are \nopen. The western border with Turkey and the eastern border with Azerbaijan have been closed \nsince  the  early  1990s.  In  addition,  Armenia  has  challenging  topography  and  weather \nconditions\u2014the country is mountainous and experiences low winter temperatures, heavy snow, \nand high-intensity rain. As a result, the cost of infrastructure development and maintenance has \nremained high.  \n \n4. \nImportant  link  between  Armenia  and  Georgia.  Armenia\u2019s  economy  relies  heavily  on \ntrade with neighboring countries through one border crossing with Iran at Meghri and two major \nborder crossings with Georgia at Bavra and Bagratashen (Map). Bavra is at the north end of the \nongoing  North\u2013South  Road  Corridor  Investment  Program  financed  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB).3 The  North\u2013South  road  corridor  will  mainly  serve  cross-border  freight  traffic  to \nwestern Georgia  and  the  Black  Sea  ports.  Bagratashen  is  connected  to  the  country\u2019s  national \nnetwork via the two-lane M6 highway, which will be upgraded by the proposed project. The M6 \nis  a vital  link connecting Armenia with Georgia  and  beyond. It  is  the  shortest  link  between the \nrespective capitals, Yerevan in Armenia and Tbilisi in Georgia. In 2014, the Bagratashen border-\ncrossing  point  handled  0.85  million  tons  of  import  and  export  freight,  representing  49%  of  the \ntotal  import  freight  tonnage  and  goods  by  road.4 Several  international  financial  institutions  are \nintegrated  border \nimprove  border  crossing  efficiency  and  develop \nworking \nmanagement  systems  in  Armenia,  including  improvements  at  Bagratashen.  The  project  is \ncrucial to the country\u2019s trade and economy, and will be indispensable in the long term. \n \nThe  M6  is  ill-equipped  to  be  a  major  trade  artery.  Originally  a  trail,  it  has  been \n5. \nrehabilitated  gradually,  but  to  basic  technical  standards  (especially  geometric  parameters) \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided small-scale project preparatory technical assistance on 9 July 2015 for due diligence. \n3  ADB.  2009.

Manila. \n\njointly \n\nto \n\n4  European Investment Bank. 2014. Feasibility Study Comprehensive Phase I Report. Luxembourg.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nbecause of its constrained alignment within the Debed gorge, a corridor it shares with Armenia\u2019s \nonly  operating  international  rail  link.  The  M6\u2019s  deteriorated  condition  imposes  high  transport \ncosts  on  users. The road pavement  is  in  poor  condition,  and  safety  and  drainage facilities are \ndeteriorated or damaged. Visibility is unacceptably short in several locations because of sharp \nbends  and  steep  gradients.  Some  structures  are  dangerous  and  need  to  be  rehabilitated \nimmediately. Every year landslides, flooding, rock falls, and heavy snowfall cause road closures. \nThese  factors  have  contributed  to  a  poor  safety  record\u2014about  30  crashes  and  six  fatalities  a \nyear during 2012\u20132014. To improve the whole 90 km of the M6, the government requested ADB \nto finance 51.5 km and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to cofinance the remaining 38.5 km. \n\n \n6. \nRoad sector achievements and challenges. Road transport plays an important role in \nthe  national  economy,  but  is  constrained  by  road  conditions  and  terrain.  In  2014,  more  than \n55%  of  freight  (measured  as  tonnage)  and  more  than  95%  of  passengers  traveled  by  road. \nArmenia\u2019s road network is 7,530 km long and comprises 1,759 km of interstate roads, 1,966 km \nof  republican  roads,  and  3,806  km  of  local  roads.  Condition  survey  data  indicates  that  the \ncondition  of  interstate  roads  has  declined  steadily  since  2010;  about  66%  was  in  good  to  fair \ncondition in 2015, down from 93% in 2010. Republican roads have fared better: 66% was in a \ngood to fair condition in 2015, up from 44% in 2010. Reliable data for local roads is not available. \nThe poor road conditions are mainly attributed to (i) a historical lack of maintenance and limited \nmaintenance  funding;  (ii)  obsolete  road  design  and  technical  specifications;  and  (iii)  a  lack  of \nqualified  workers,  contractors,  and  consulting  companies  with  the  necessary  knowledge  and \nskills. \n \n7. \nRoad  sector  institutions.  The MOTC is the principal government agency in charge of \nthe transport sector. It administers all interstate and republican roads. MOTC delegates its road \nadministration functions (including collection of road and traffic data and asset management) to \nthe  Armenian  Roads  Directorate,  a  state-owned  noncommercial  organization,  through  annual \ncontracts.  Marzes  (regional  administrations)  and  local  communities  manage  all  local  roads.  \nThe institutional capacity of MOTC will be strengthened through trainings to be provided under \nthe project management supports. \n \n8. \nRoad  safety.  The  number  of  road  traffic  deaths  in  Armenia  per  100,000  people  is  \nhigh.5 While the number of recorded deaths has remained at about 300 per year between 2011 \nand 2014, the number of crashes and the recorded number of injuries have risen about 11% per \nyear during the same period.6 Armenia has developed a road safety action plan with support of \nthe  European  Union  through  Transport Corridor Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia  regional  road  safety \nproject in 2014, but the implementation is still pending due to lack of fund.  The National Road \nSafety Council, an advisory body established in 2010, is not fully operational. To augment road \nsafety, improvements are needed in institutional coordination, traffic safety audits, road designs \n(including signs and markings), speed limit enforcement, and other areas.  \n \n9. \nGovernment  sector  strategy  and  plans. Improving transport system is a government \npriority, as reflected by its inclusion in the Armenian Development Strategy (ADS), 2014\u20132025. \nThe  government  strategies  see  the  development  and  increased  efficiency  of  the  transport \nsystem  as  a  prerequisite  for  economic  growth  and  increased  access  to  social  and  economic \nservices. The project is in line with the government\u2019s development strategies, as well as ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n5   World Health Organization. 2015.

The  project  will  reduce  the  road \n10. \nmaintenance  backlog,  contributing  to  the  sustainable  road  maintenance  initiative  being \ndeveloped  by  ADB  and the World Bank  under  separate  interventions.  Under the  Infrastructure \nSustainability Support Program,8 approved by ADB in 2014, the government began a series of \nreforms to strengthen results-based management systems. The aim was to address some of the \nroad  sector  constraints  in  order  to  help  meet  the  government\u2019s  development  priorities.  \nGreat progress has been made in the phase 1 of the support program: (i) several government \nagencies were restructured to align them more closely with the functions required in the sector, \n(ii) program budgeting structures were implemented to enable expenditures to be more focused \non  results,  (iii)  policies  and  procedures  were  introduced  to  improve  road  asset  management, \nand (iv) a road sector financing strategy was prepared to allow the government to view the road \nsector networks as assets and understand the costs of underfunding or poor resource allocation. \nPhase  2  of  the  support  program,  which  is  being  prepared  and  is  expected  to  be  approved  in \n2016, will propose an increase in the budget allocation for road network maintenance through a \nsystematic approach until 2021. \n \nImproved social benefits of the project. The project will help improve access to social \n11. \nservices, agriculture, tourism, and jobs, with the aim of reducing regional economic and social \ndisparities. The project will benefit Lori Marz (region), a major tourism destination with beautiful \nand dramatic  landscapes.9 The area  attracts  local  and international  tourists from  Europe, Iran, \nthe  Russian  Federation,  and  other  countries.  Tourism  is  a  significant  part  of  the  Armenian \neconomy:  international  tourist  arrivals  have  grown  about  14%  per  year  since  2006,  reaching \nalmost  1  million  in  2013.10 The  project  will  help  the  region  transition  from  its  historically  high \ndependence  on  minerals  and  chemicals  to  a  more  diversified  economy  with  an  emphasis  on \ntourism and service sectors. \n\n \n12. \nLessons  learned.  The  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  learned  from  previous \nprojects,  including  the  following:  (i)  close  monitoring  and technical  support  on  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement  activities  are  necessary  at  an  early  stage  of  the  project  preparation;  \n(ii)  a  strong  project  implementation  unit,  especially  in  procurement  and  contract  management,  \nis  indispensable  for  successful  implementation;  and  (iii)  expeditious  decision-making  by  the \ngovernment and streamlined internal approval procedures are needed to ensure that contracts \nare awarded as scheduled and implementation is effective.  \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) accelerated deterioration of the road \n13. \nnetwork prevented; and (ii) safe, quick, and easy transportation ensured.11 The outcome will be \nimproved transport efficiency and safety along the Vanadzor\u2013Bagratashen section of the M6. \n \n\n                                                \n7   ADB. 2014.

A cofinancing letter was signed by EIB and issued to ADB on 4 July 2016. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n18. \nThe  MOTC  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Transport  Project  Implementation  Unit \n(TPIU), which was established in 2006 and satisfactorily implemented the World Bank\u2019s Lifeline \nRoad Network Improvement Project, will be the implementing unit. The TPIU, which is headed \nby a director, has about 15 permanent staff and 10 contractual staff. Recognizing that the TPIU \nneeds  to  be  strengthened,  ADB  and  EIB  agreed  to  use  part  of  their  loan  proceeds  to  provide \nsupport  to  TPIU  in  the  areas  of  safeguards  and  procurement  to  ensure  successful  project \nimplementation. \n \n19. \nADB and EIB agreed to fully share information acquired in connection with the project so \nthat it may be used by both banks in project processing and implementation.

It  will  improve  the \n21. \nexisting  two-lane  highway  from  Vanadzor  to  the  Georgia  border  at  Bagratashen,  following  the \nexisting alignment except for a few sections where minor realignments are required to improve \ngeometric  alignment,  sight  distance,  and  safety.  The  project  road  will  be  reconstructed  with  a \ncarriageway  width of 6.6 meters and 1.5\u20132.4-meter shoulders. The design speed is 60\u201380 km \nper hour in rolling terrain with a maximum grade of 3%, and 40\u201360 km per hour in hilly terrain \nwith a maximum grade of 8%. The scope of construction work includes earthwork and pavement \nimprovements;  and  safety \nworks;  reconstruction  of  some  bridges;  drainage;  roadside \nengineering  features  such  as  traffic  signs,  road  markings,  and  traffic  barriers.  In  addition,  \na  climate  change  risk  mitigation  assessment  will  be  carried  out  before  construction  starts, \nfocusing on measures such as slope protection and stabilization, rock fall protection, landslide \nand  flood  protection,  and  other  issues  related  to  climate  change.  The  detailed  design  was \nprepared by an international consultant engaged by EIB in accordance with acceptable Armenia \nstandards and international practices. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe  economic  and financial  analysis  concluded  that  the  project  is  economically  viable. \nThe  economic  evaluation  covered  the  entire  90  km  of  road  for  both  the  with-project  and  \nwithout-project scenarios. The project will generate economic benefits mainly through (i) vehicle \noperating cost savings; (ii) travel time savings of users; and (iii) improved road safety as a result \nof  better  pavement  conditions,  geometric  design,  and  sight  distances.  The  economic  analysis \nshows that such benefits would allow the project to produce an economic internal rate of return \nof 20.9%. Although they may not be readily quantifiable, additional economic benefits are likely \nto accrue through lower emissions of air pollutants, noise, and greenhouse gases, as well as the \npromotion of local tourism that creates more jobs along the road. \n \nThe project road will not earn revenue through tolls. However, the project is expected to \n23. \nreduce  the  periodic  and  routine  maintenance  requirements  of  the  M6  considerably.  After  the \nproject,  the  routine  unit  maintenance  requirements  will  be  close  to  the  budget  allocation; \n\n\f7 \n\nperiodic maintenance requirements, when averaged over the evaluation period, will be greater \nthan  the  current  budget  allocation.  Even  the  reduced  requirements  will  be  a  challenge  for  the \ngovernment to cover. The 2016 budget for periodic and routine maintenance  is AMD4.0 billion \nfor all interstates and AMD6.25 billion for republican roads. Special measures will be required to \nensure  that  adequate  budget  is  allocated  to  road  maintenance,  including  for  this  project.  \nUnder phase 2 of the support program,15 ADB is helping the government to take proactive steps \nto  increase the  budget  allocation  for  road  maintenance  and  enhance  its  effectiveness  through \npolicy dialogue. \n \n24. \nSensitivity  tests  and calculations  of  switching  values  were  carried  out  to  determine  the \neffect  of  variations  in  key  input  parameters.  The  result  shows  switching  values  of  174%  for \nconstruction costs and 45% for benefits\u2014meaning the project would be economically efficient if \nconstruction  costs  were  to  rise  by  74%  or  the  benefits  were  to  fall  by  55%  of  the  base  case \nvalues.  Project  viability  is  also  robust  in  the  face  of  traffic  diversion  to  Bavra  from  2022,  \nthe  absence  of  crash  cost  benefits  and  larger-than-anticipated  traffic  disruption  during \nconstruction. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nFinancial  management.  A financial  management  assessment  of the  MOTC  confirmed \nthat it has sufficient capacity to manage and maintain the accounting systems, financial controls, \nand  audit  arrangements  required  for  the  project.  The  MOTC\u2019s  financial  accounting,  auditing \nrules,  and  internal  control  systems  follow  generally  accepted  international  accounting  and \nauditing  practices.  The  MOTC  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts  to  identify  \n(i)  the  works,  goods,  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds;  (ii)  financing  resources \nreceived;  (iii)  expenditures  incurred  for  the  project;  and  (iv)  the  use  of  counterpart  funds, \nincluding  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial  reporting  arrangements.  An  independent \nchartered  accounting  firm  will  audit  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements \nannually in accordance with national and international auditing standards. \n \nThe  TPIU\u2019s  financial  management  risk  is  considered  moderate  and  can  be  lowered  by \n26. \nmitigating  measures.  An  assessment \ntwo  main  financial  management  risks:  \nidentified \n(i)  the  project  and  TPIU  will  be  unable  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  on  financial \nmanagement  and  loan  disbursements  because  of  inexperience  with  ADB  projects,  and  \n(ii)  high  turnover  of  TPIU  financial  management  staff  because  of  low  salaries  and  significant \nworkloads may result in operating inefficiency. These financial management risks will be closely \nmonitored during project implementation. \n\n27. \nProcurement. A procurement risk assessment of the MOTC indicated that procurement \nrisk is moderate. The government has established a sound governance mechanism and has the \nexperience  to  undertake  procurement  according  to  the  World  Bank\u2019s  procurement  policy.  \nThe  MOTC\u2019s  main  procurement  management  challenges  are  (i)  high  turnover  of  experienced \nprocurement  staff,  (ii)  complex  and  bureaucratic  internal  approval  systems  that  can  cause \nproject  startup  delays,  and  (iii) multiple layers  of  review  and approving  authorities. To mitigate \nthese risks, a master bidding document was prepared, advance procurement has been sought, \nand a procurement consultant will be recruited to assist the TPIU. The procurement consultant \nwill also provide some on-the-job training to ensure experience will stay after the project. \n\n                                                \n15 ADB.  2015.  Technical  Assistance  to  Armenia  for  the  Infrastructure  Sustainability  Support  Program,  Phase  2. \n\nManila (TA 9065-ARM). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n28. \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOTC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nAn  assessment  of  social  impacts  and  analysis  of  key  stakeholders\u2019  perceptions  and \nconcerns  about  the  project  have  been  conducted  with  positive  feedback.  The  project  will  help \nthe  area  to  transition  from  an  abandoned  chemical  hub  to  a  tourist  and  leisure  destination.  \nThe  potential  beneficiaries  are  local  communities,  regional  and  cross-border  road  users, \npassengers,  and  transporters  of  goods.  The  project  will  provide  them  with  safer  and  faster \naccess  to  Georgia  and  the  countries  to  the  north,  and  will  reduce  their  transportation  costs.  \nThe main gender issues in the area are unemployment, and vertical and horizontal labor force \nsegregation. Women are present in a narrower band of occupational categories\u2014generally the \nones  with  lower  remuneration  such  as  education  and  health\u2014and  at  lower  levels  of \nresponsibility.  The  project  does  not  have  gender  design  elements  because  of  its  focus  on \nconstruction  of  road  works.  Increased  tourism  arrivals  may  have  indirect  benefits  for  women \nworking in this sector. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nADB  and  EIB  agreed  to  adopt  a  single  social  and  environmental  assessment  and \nplanning  process,  as  well  as  unified  safeguard  documentation,  consultation,  and  disclosure \nrequirements to satisfy both ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and EIB\u2019s environmental \nand  social  standards  as  stipulated  in  the  EIB\u2019s  Statement  on  the  Environmental  and  Social \nPrinciples  and  Standards  and  EIB\u2019s  Environmental  and  Social  Handbook. 16  During  project \nimplementation, ADB will be responsible for supervising and monitoring the environmental and \nsocial  aspects  of  the  ADB-financed  section,  while  EIB  will  be  responsible  for  reviewing  and \nmonitoring the environmental and social aspects of the EIB-financed section. \n \n31. \nEnvironment. The project for the ADB-financed section is classified category B for  the \nenvironment.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  prepared  as  part  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examination for the ADB-financed road section, includes mitigation measures to \naddress  all  construction  and  operational  impacts.  The  EMP  will  form  part  of  the  bidding \ndocuments.  During  project  implementation,  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring the environmental compliance of the ADB-financed section. The TPIU at MOTC will \nbe  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  all  safeguards  requirements,  and  the  TPIU  has \nengaged  a  contractual  environment  specialist  for  this  purpose.  However,  the  TPIU  needs  to \nbuild  environment  capacity  and  will  be  required  to  hire  a  full-time  qualified  environment \nspecialist to review and oversee the implementation of the initial environmental examination and \nEMP.  The  contractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  mitigation  measures  in  the  field \nthrough an environment specialist. The environment specialist of the supervision consultant will \nconduct environmental supervision in the field. A grievance redress mechanism to handle both \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  issues  will  be  established  to  receive  feedback  and \ncomplaints, if any, from affected parties and to address them during construction and operation. \nThe TPIU will submit to ADB and relevant government authorities the semiannual environmental \nmonitoring reports for the ADB-financed section. These reports will be disclosed to the public on \nwebsites of the MOTC (Armenian) and ADB (English). \n\n                                                \n16 EIB.  2009.

With  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  the  MOTC  has  prepared  a  draft  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  that  contains  a  preliminary  social  impact  assessment  based  on  the \ncadastral  data.  The  assessment  indicates  that  the  project  will  permanently  acquire  542  land \nplots  covering  212,871  square  meters  in  nine  communities,  affecting  private,  community,  and \nstate land. This includes 44 residential land plots, 10 businesses, and 11 leaseholders on state \nand  community  lands.  The  project  will  affect  303  households  (788  persons  at  an  average \nhousehold  size  of  2.6),  most  of  which  will  be  partially  but  permanently  affected.  \nFor  implementation,  the  LARP  will  be  updated  with  census  data,  an  assets  inventory,  and \nconsultations  with  the  identified  affected  households  during  the  detailed  measurement  survey \nupon  issuance  of  the  requisite  decree  by  the  government.  In  Armenia,  there  are  chronic \ndiscrepancies  between cadastral maps  and the  objects  on the ground. Therefore,  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  will  determine  the  correct  status  of  the  affected  structures  and  the \nconsequent number of the project-affected persons, which may have been overestimated earlier. \nBased  on  the  current  data,  44  residential  and  10  business  structures  are  expected  to  be \nrelocated. \n \n33. \nThe  draft  LARP  details  the  impacts  of  land  acquisition  and  proposes  ways  to  mitigate \nthem,  including  an  entitlement  matrix.  Provisions  have  been  made  for  (i)  the  loss  of  land, \njobs;  \nresidential  and  nonresidential  buildings,  public  property,  crops,  businesses,  and \n(ii)  allowances  for  severe  impacts;  (iii)  relocation  allowance;  and  (iv)  temporary  impacts.  \nThe  LARP  also  covers  asset  valuation,  compensation  provisions,  organizational  setup,  \na  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  compliance  with  ADB  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation requirements. The provisions of the draft LARP have been discussed and disclosed \nduring  consultations  with  the  community.  The  TPIU  has  implemented  World  Bank  and  ADB \nprojects involving involuntary resettlement and has engaged a safeguards consultant. Generally, \nexecuting  agencies  in  Armenia  have  a  strong  commitment  to  meeting  ADB\u2019s  safeguards \nrequirements  and  managing  the  social  risks.  The  LARP  was  disclosed  to  the  public  on  the \nwebsites  of  the  MOTC  (Armenian)  and  ADB  (English).  After  implementation  of  the  LARP,  \na  compliance  report  prepared  by  an  external  monitor  will  be  submitted  to  ADB,  which  will  be  \na precondition for initiating the civil works. \n \n34. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples,  \nas  there  are  no  indigenous  peoples  near  the  ADB-financed  road  section  or  in  the  country,  \nas defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for operational purposes. Accordingly,  \nno indigenous peoples planning documents will be required. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35.  Major risks and mitigating measure are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 17  Overall,  the  risks  can  be  managed  by \nadopting  mitigating  measures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n10 \n\nRisks \nImplementation of program budgeting \nhas been limited by weak capacity and \npoor information flows, which results in \nunsustainability of road maintenance \n\nInadequate project management capacity \nof the TPIU and extra workload to meet \nADB and EIB requirements might delay \nproject procurement and implementation \n\nCost overruns \n\nInadequate measures for climate change \nimpact risk \n\nfurther \n\nimprove \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Sustainability  Support  Programa  (phase  1  is \nongoing, phase 2 is being prepared) will help strengthen capacity and \nimprove  program  budgeting  in  the  road  subsector.

ADB  has \ndiscussed  with  the  government  increasing  salaries  with  a  special \narrangement for  TPIU staff, but it may take  more time to be effective. \nThe  government  agreed  to  hire  consultants,  including  specialists  in \nprocurement,  engineering,  environment,  safeguards,  and  financial \nmanagement,  under  the  loan  to  strengthen  the  TPIU  during  project \nimplementation.  EIB  also  agreed  to  allocate  funds  to  strengthen  the \nTPIU\u2019s capacity. ADB and EIB agreed to enhance coordination through \njoint  missions  and  sharing  of  information.  Advanced  contracting \nactions have been initiated for consultants and civil works. \nA  sufficient  contingency  has  been  allocated  to  ensure  better  cost \nestimates before awarding of civil works contracts. \nLocated  in  mountainous  terrain,  the  project  is  vulnerable  to  disasters \nsuch  as  floods,  landslides,  rock  falls,  slope  erosion,  and  snowfall.  \nA climate change expert with  a strong engineering background will be \nthe  existing  design  and  propose  specific \nengaged \nengineering  solutions  and  measures  to  adapt  to  the  climate  change \nimpacts. \n\nto  review \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EIB = European Investment Bank, TPIU = Transport Project Implementation Unit. \na ADB. 2014.
