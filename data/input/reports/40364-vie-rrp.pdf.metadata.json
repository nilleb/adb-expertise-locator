They  are  intended  to  improve  the  quality \nof the environment and the living standards of rural communities. \nThe benefits of the subprojects include an increase in the number \nof  houses  connected  to  clean  and  reliable  water  for  drinking  and \nsanitation, a reduction in or elimination of flooding and stagnation \nof  wastewater,  and  better  personal  sanitation.  The  potential \nadverse  environmental \nimpacts  associated  with  design, \nconstruction, and operation of the subprojects will mostly be small \nand  localized  and  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  proper \nengineering  design  and  implementation  of  the  mitigation  and \ninitial  environmental \nmonitoring  measures \nidentified \nexaminations.  An  environmental  assessment  and \nreview \nframework has been prepared for future subprojects. \n \nThe  project  will  increase  access  to  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nimproving the health and quality of life of the rural population in six \nselected provinces in the central coastal region of Viet Nam. The \nits \nthe  government \nproject  will  support \nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132010, \nincluding \nreducing  poverty  to  10%\u201311%  of  households  by  2010.  In  so \ndoing,  it  will  help  the  government  to  achieve  the  Vietnamese \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n \nThe  project  will  provide  piped  water  and  hygienic  sanitation  to \nabout  350,000  people  living  in  rural  areas.  The  project  has  a \nstrong  poverty  focus  and  its  design  is  based  on  lessons  from \nprevious interventions in the sector. The implementation will follow \na  community-based  approach  and  will  focus  on  (i)  improving \nhygienic behavior, (ii) strengthening operation and maintenance of \nthe water supply works, and (iii) monitoring and evaluation of the \noutputs  and \nimpacts  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninvestments.  \n \n\nimplementing \n\nin \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nIn  2006,  about  46%  of  the  rural  population  of  Viet  Nam  had \naccess  to  clean  water,  although  at  quantities  barely  sufficient  to \nsupport  their  basic  needs  and  not  continuously  throughout  the \nyear.  About  83%  of  the  population  had  latrines,  but  only  48%  of \nthese  could  be  considered  hygienic.  About  37%  of  the  rural \npopulation  still  practiced  open  defecation.  In  2006,  about  72%  of \npublic  schools  had  latrines  but  only  12%  of  them  were  hygienic. \nOnly 21% of commune health centers had latrines.  \n \nKnowledge  of  individual  sanitation  was  still  poor.  In  2006  only \n2.3%  of  the  rural  population  knew  that  hand  washing  with  soap \nmay  prevent  some  communicable  diseases,  and  only  13%  of \nhouseholds  and  11%  of  the  students  washed  their  hands  with \nsoap before meals and after urination or defecation.  \n \nBetter access to clean water and hygienic sanitation will improve \npublic health. This in turn will reduce poverty by reducing medical \nexpenses  and  productive  days  lost.  In  addition,  the  project  will \nalso reduce the burden on woman and girls, who are traditionally \ntasked with water collection and caring for sick family members. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  health  and  living \nconditions of people living in rural areas in the project provinces. \nThe project will contribute to the National Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Strategy to 2020, which states that, by 2020, 100% of \nthe  rural  population  will  (i)  have  access  to  clean  water,  with  a \nminimum  volume  of  60  liters  per  capita  per  day,  (ii)  use  hygienic \nlatrines, and (iii) practice proper personal hygiene. \n \nThe outcome will be access to clean water and hygienic sanitation \nfor  about  350,000  people  living  in  rural  areas  in  about  30 \ncommunes  in  the  six  project  provinces  in  the  central  coastal \nregion  of  Viet  Nam:  Binh  Dinh,  Ha  Tinh,  Nghe  An,  Quang  Binh, \nQuang Nam, and Thanh Hoa.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $50  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.4 million.  \n \n\nTentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n \nTotal \n45.00 \n2.63 \n2.37 \n50.00 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n  90.00 \n5.27 \n \n \n4.73 \n 100.00 \n\n \n \n \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nThe  loan  will  be  granted  by  the  government  to  the  provincial \npeople's committees of the six project provinces. \n \n01 October 2010 \u2212 30 June 2017 \n\n\f \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n31 December 2016 \n\nthe  commune \n\nimprovement.

The provincial Departments \nof  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  will  set  up  a  provincial \nproject  management  unit.  The  provincial  Viet  Nam  women\u2019s \nunions  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  revolving  funds  for \nlevel,  water  and \nsanitation \nsanitation commune committees will be established and sanitation \nand health promoters identified to ensure community participation \nin  project  implementation  and  implement  hygiene  awareness \nactivities. \n \nGoods,  works,  and  services  financed  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  will  be  procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement  contracts  will  contain  anticorruption  provisions  as \nspecified by ADB. Procurement will generally be carried out by the \nPPMUs and supported by the international consultant. Civil works \nabove  $2,000,000  or  goods  above  $500,000  will  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding. Civil works with value of \n$2,000,000 or less and goods with value of $500,000 or less, will \nbe procured through national competitive bidding. Civil works and \ngoods  with  value  of  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  through \nshopping.  Civil  works  contracts  for  household  sanitation  with  a \ntotal  value  of  $5,000  or  less  can  be  procured  at  the  commune \nlevel  and  will  follow  community  participation  in  procurement  in \nimplementing  small \naccordance  with  ADB's  procedures \nprojects with community participation.  \n \nConsultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsulting services will include the following packages: (i) general \nproject  management;  (ii)  technical  design  and  procurement \nservices; (iii) preparation of safeguard documents; (iv) community \ninformation,  education,  and  communication \nmobilization  and \nimplementation; and (v)  capacity building of water supply system \noperators.  Consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  to  provide  these \nservices, at a total of 1,497 person-months, of which 285 person-\nmonths  will  be  for  international  specialists  and  1,212  person-\nmonths  for  national  specialists.  The  consulting  services  will  be \nacquired  through  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method. \nThe  technical  proposals  will  be  given  a  weight  of  80%  and  the \nfinancial  proposals  20%.  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  will  be \napplicable \nthe  consulting  services.

The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the \nadvance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance  the  project,  and  that  the  action  should  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nIn  the  subproject  areas,  all  the  households  will  be  provided  with \nclean water and sanitation services in an equitable and affordable \nmanner.  The  project  will  provide  access  to  clean  water  and \nhygiene  sanitation  facilities  to  approximately  350,000  people, \nabout  27%  of  whom  live  in  poverty,  compared  with  16%  in  Viet \nNam  as  a  whole.  Access  to  clean  water  and  sanitation  at  the \nhousehold  level  is  expected  to  improve  public  health,  especially \nchild health, and to reduce medical expenditure. \n \nThe  potential  risks  are:  (i)  poor  households  may  not  be  able  to \nafford  water  tariffs  that  will  provide  full  cost  recovery;  (ii)  local \ngovernment  agencies  may  not  be  able  to  implement  community-\nbased approaches and gender strategies, or may resist doing so; \n(iii) implementation of information, education, and communication \nmaterials  may  take  a  traditional  top-down  approach  instead  of \nintensive  community  mobilization;  (iv)  women,  poor  people,  and \nmembers of ethnic minorities may be marginalized in the decision \nmaking  and  planning  of  water  and  sanitation  facilities  at  the \ncommunity \nlevel;  (v)  beneficiaries  may  not  adopt  hygienic \nbehavior,  which  may  reduce  some  benefits  of  the  project; \n(vi) water supply facilities may not be sustainable because of low \nwater  tariffs  and  improper  operation  and  maintenance.  Risk \nmitigation measures are integrated into the project design. \n \nThe  main  assumptions  are  that  the  government  (i)  remains \ncommitted  to  the  rural  water  supply  sector  and  continues  to \nprovide counterpart funding, (ii) is willing to learn from the lessons \nof  previous  interventions  in  the  sector,  and  (iii)  makes  available \nsufficient  staff  for  project  planning  and  implementation  at  central \nand  provincial  level.

It  will  also \nsupport \ntargets  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP), \n2006\u22122010, 2  including  reducing  the  poverty  rate  to  10%\u221211%.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  average  gross \ndomestic product growth of 7.8% per year between 2002 and 2007 reduced its overall poverty \nrate  from  28.9%  to  16.0%.  However,  the  poverty  rate  in  the  rural  areas  (where  72%  of  the \npeople live) is still 20.4%. The framework for all poverty reduction activities in Viet Nam is the \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy, 3  which  recognizes  that  access  to \nclean  and  safe  water  and  hygienic  latrines4 is  one  of  the  preconditions  for  poverty  reduction, \nparticularly for Viet Nam's rural population.  \n \nIn  2006,  about  46%  of  the  rural  population  had  access  to  clean  water,  although  at \n3. \nquantities  barely  sufficient  to  support  basic  needs  and  not  continuously  throughout  the  year. \nAbout 83% of the population had latrines, but only 48% of these could be considered hygienic. \nAbout  37%  of  the  rural  population  still  practiced  open  defecation.  In  2006,  about  72%  of  the \npublic  schools  had  latrines  but  only  12%  of  them  were  hygienic,  while  only  21%  of  commune \nhealth centers had latrines.  \n \n4. \nKnowledge of individual sanitation was still poor. In 2006  only 2.3% of rural population \nknew that hand washing with soap may prevent some communicative diseases, and only 13% \nof  households  and  11%  of  students  washed  their  hands  with  soap  before  meals  and  after \nurination or defecation.  \n \nBetter access to clean water and hygienic sanitation will improve public health. In turn, \n5. \nthis will reduce poverty by reducing medical expenses and productive days lost. The burden on \nwomen  and  girls,  who  are  traditionally  tasked  with  water  collection  and  caring  for  sick  family \nmembers, will be reduced. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n6. \nGeographic focus.  The central coastal region of Viet Nam consists of 14 provinces and \naccounts for about 30% of the country's total land area. The population is predominantly rural \n(78%). The focus of the proposed project on this region is justified by its high poverty levels, low \nwater supply and sanitation coverage, and the limited availability of suitable water resources. \n \nHigh  poverty  levels.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  central  coastal  provinces  have  higher \n7. \npoverty levels than the national average, surpassed only by the northern and central highlands \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Table 3 indicates that open defecation is widely practiced in \n\nDrainage  problems.  The  surface  drainage  facilities  available  in  some  communes  are \n10. \naffected  by  a  lack  of  proper  facilities  for  gray  wastewater  and  storm  water.  This  leads  to \nstagnant  water  pools,  mosquito  breeding,  and  flooding  by  contaminated  water  during  rains. \nThese  problems  are  acute  in  the  areas  located  in  the  coastal  flat  terrain,  which  have  high \ngroundwater tables. \n \n11. \nLack  of  exploitable  water  sources.  The  shallow  groundwater  layers  in  the  central \nregion contain high levels of salinity, turbidity, hardness, fluoride, iron, manganese, aluminum, \nand pollution from human, industrial, and livestock waste. Surface water is often of poor quality \ndue  to  turbidity,  organic  matter,  and  pollution  by  surface  runoff  that  contains  micro-organisms \nand  agricultural  chemicals.  The  central  coastal  provinces  have  low  amounts  of  exploitable \ngroundwater, so many poor rural households use highly polluted water for their daily needs. \n\n2.60 \n4.70 \n1.80 \n\n1.40 \n1.60 \n1.90 \n0.80 \n3.30 \n2.10 \n4.00 \n4.70 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \nItem \nNational \n   Urban \n   Rural  \nBy region \n\nRed River Delta               \nNorth East  \nNorth West  \nNorth Central  Coast  \nSouth Central  Coast  \nCentral Highland  \nSouth East  \nMekong River Delta  \n\nHouseholds \nwith Toilets and \nSeptic Tanks \n\nTable 3: Sanitation Coverage, 2006 \n(%) \nHouseholds \nwith Pour Flush \nToilets \n4.70 \n6.10 \n4.20 \n  \n2.60 \n2.10 \n1.80 \n3.20 \n8.20 \n13.20 \n9.00 \n3.20 \n\n34.30 \n73.80 \n19.30 \n  \n41.60 \n19.30 \n13.30 \n18.50 \n39.60 \n23.20 \n66.00 \n23.70 \n\nHouseholds with \nDouble Vault \nComposting Toilets \n\n \nOpen \nDefecation \n\n \n\n20.10 \n6.70 \n25.10 \n \n34.00 \n34.90 \n10.90 \n42.10 \n12.90 \n4.60 \n3.80 \n1.80 \n\n29.90 \n10.20 \n37.50 \n\n19.40 \n41.60 \n70.30 \n35.00 \n38.80 \n56.50 \n19.50 \n24.30 \n\nSource: Viet Nam household living standard survey (2006). \n\n \nGovernment strategy and investment plan. Government intervention in the rural water \n12. \nsupply and sanitation (RWSS) sector began in 1999 with the development of a national RWSS \nstrategy, which set ambitious coverage targets for 2010 (85% coverage for clean water supply \nand  70%  for  hygienic  latrines)  and  2020  (100%  coverage  for  both  clean  water  supply  and \nhygienic latrines). At that time, less than 30% of the rural population had access to water that \nmet  basic  hygienic  criteria,  and  less  than  20%  of  rural  households  had  hygienic  latrines. \nInvestment  in  RWSS  was  only  10%  of  the  amount  needed,  and  the  understanding  of  good \nhygienic  practices  was  low.  In  addition,  RWSS  programs  were  fragmented,  with  little \ncoordination among ministries and departments, and the legislative environment was weak with \nrespect to regulations and guidelines for managing the sector. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2 \nand an overview of external assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \nIn  developing  the  strategy,  the  importance  of  RWSS  was  recognized,  as  75%  of  the \n13. \nnational population lives in rural areas. In recognition of the importance of improving the RWSS \nsector, the government made it one of seven national target programs for the period 2001\u20132005 \n(NTP I). An evaluation of NTP I in 2005 revealed that progress had been made5 and assumed \nthat  the  water  supply  coverage  targets  for  2010  and  2020  would  be  met,  provided  current \ninvestment  levels  were  maintained.  For  sanitation,  however,  there  was  little  prospect  of \nachieving  the  planned  targets,  since  the  reliance  on  household  finances  to  build  latrines  had \ncaused coverage rates of the poor to lag far behind those of better-off households. The review \nalso  stressed  the  importance  of  targeting  government  and  partner  organization  support  at  the \npoorest  populations,  specifically  in  coastal  areas,  where  population  density  is  high  and \nexploitable water supplies are limited. \n \nA second national target program was approved in 2006, covering the period 2006\u20132010 \n14. \n(NTP  II),  which  addressed  some  of  the  issues  identified  in  the  evaluation  of  NTP  I.6 NTP  II \ntargets  increasing  access  to  clean  water  for  an  additional  14.7  million  people  and  the \n                                                 \n5  (i) Water supply coverage was extended to 23 million people and 3.7 million more households were using hygienic \nlatrines;  (ii)  it  led  to  improvement  in  hygienic  practices,  and  the  number  of  schools,  commune  health  clinics,  and \nrural  markets  with  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  increased;  (iii)  funding  sources  were  diversified;  and  \n(iv) legal documents and guidelines were prepared to encourage different economic sectors to invest in the water \nsupply and sanitation sector and to stimulate a diversification of management models. \n\n6  (i) Improved institutional structure and coordination among stakeholders; (ii) decentralization and building capacity \nfor  planning  and  implementation  at  provincial  and  district  levels;  (iii)  development  of  coherent  legal,  policy  and \nregulatory  settings,  including  increased  involvement  of  communities;  (iv)  greater  focus  on  sanitation  by \nstrengthening information education and communication (IEC) activities as an integral part of any RWSS program; \n(v) greater participation by local communities; and (vi) better monitoring and evaluation of RWSS data. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nconstruction  of  hygienic  latrines  for  an  additional  2.6  million  households.  The  total  national \nbudget for these activities was estimated at $1.4 billion and that for the central coastal region at \n$317  million7 (23%),  of  which  15%  or  $48  million  is  expected  to  be  financed  by  international \npartner  organizations.  The  remainder  will  be  financed  by  the  central  government  (14%),  local \ngovernment (10%), and beneficiaries (61%). Currently, the government is reviewing the national \nstrategy on RWSS, to be completed by November 2009. Based on the result of this review, it \nwill  be  decided  whether  the  current  5-year  national  target  program  will  be  extended,  or \ndesignated differently. Nevertheless, the national RWSS strategy provides a pragmatic strategic \napproach toward achieving 100% access to safe water and sanitation services in rural areas by \n2020 and it has been adopted by the current project. \n \n15. \nKey sector institutions. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  RWWS  strategy  through  its  provincial  departments  of \nagriculture  and  rural  development  (DARDs).  Under  MARD  is  a  National  Center  for  Rural  and \nClean  Water  and  Environmental  Sanitation  (NCERWASS)  to  which  MARD  has  delegated \nresponsibility for RWSS project implementation. At the provincial level, project implementation is \ndelegated  by  DARDs  to  provincial  centers  for  rural  and  clean  water  and  environmental \nsanitation  (PCERWASS).  The  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH),  General  Department  of  Preventive \nMedicine  and  AIDS  control  is  responsible  for  setting  and  monitoring  drinking  water  quality \nstandards and for developing public awareness of hygiene and health. The MOH works through \nits provincial departments of health (DOHs) and district and commune health care centers. The \nMinistry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  is  responsible  for  implementing  school  sanitation \nprograms  through  its  provincial  departments  of  education  and  training  (DOETs).  In  2007, \nMARD, MOH, and MOET signed an interministerial circular on guidelines for implementing and \ncoordinating  the  RWSS  strategy  among  the  three  ministries.  Information,  education,  and \ncommunication (IEC) guidelines issued by NCERWASS recognized the importance of commune \ncommittees and local health promoters in increasing awareness of sanitation and hygiene. Mass \norganizations,  such  as  women\u2019s  unions,  play  important  roles  in  community  mobilization  and \ninitiating community-based savings or credit groups. \n \n16. \nCountry  strategy  and  program.  The  current  CSP  for  Viet  Nam  aims  to  support  the \ngovernment  in  implementing  its  SEDP,  2006\u20132010  and  reducing  poverty  to  10%\u201311%  of \nhouseholds  by  2010.  The  SEDP  has  a  strong  results  orientation,  with  performance  indicators \nthat  include  the  Vietnamese  Millennium  Development  Goals.  ADB's  support  for  the  RWSS \nsector  is  in  line  with  (i)  the  government's  and  ADB's  overall  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  by \nfocusing  on  the  poor  rural  population;  and  (ii)  ADB's  support  for  achieving  the  Viet  Nam \nDevelopment Goals, especially those on improving access to water supply and sanitation. The \nproposed  project  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,8 specifically  pillar  number  II:  inclusive \nsocial development. It will provide poor rural communities with access to infrastructure, the lack \nof which is listed as a key constraint on reducing poverty in ADB's country operations business \nplan, 2009\u20132011.9 The proposed project is in line with ADB's continued geographic focus on the \ncentral region, and complements past and ongoing ADB projects10 in this region by building on \nprevious capacity development and infrastructure projects. The proposed project is included in \nthe country operations business plan as a loan project for 2009. \n\n                                                 \n7  $181 million for water supply, $96 million for sanitation and $40 million for IEC and capacity building. \n8  ADB.  2008.

Continued  support  from  partner  organizations  will  be  needed  for  the \ngovernment  to  implement  NTP  II  and  achieve  the  targets  set  out  in  the  RWSS  strategy.  This \nstrategy  expects  an  unrealistically  high  contribution  by  the  beneficiaries  to  the  total  budget  of \n61%.  The  budget  calculations  are  based  on  assumed  investment  costs  of  $34  per  capita  for \nwater supply and $20 per household for sanitation, which is considerably lower than commonly \nused unit prices.11 It is expected that the actual budget will be four to five times higher than this \nand  that  contributions  from  partner  organizations  eight  to  ten  times  higher  than  current \nestimates will be required. When it reviews the strategy, the government will address this issue \nby  preparing  a  more  detailed  budget  estimate  and  financing  plan.  Without  increased  support \nfrom partner organizations, the RWSS targets will not be achieved.   \n \n18. \nNeed  for  piped  water  supply  systems. The government has recognized the need for \npiped water supply systems to be constructed in areas where access to clean water sources is \nlimited, because of the pollution of shallow groundwater and water scarcity. The RWSS strategy \nstresses the importance of promoting piped water supply systems, while the NTP II calls for the \nconstruction of 4,900 new piped water supply schemes nationwide. The government's policy is \nto provide these schemes without charge in areas where the population is predominantly poor, \nprovided the systems will create sufficient revenues to be operated in a sustainable manner. \n \n19. \nLimited  focus  on  sanitation  improvement.  Sanitation  has  been  widely  neglected  by \nthe  existing  planning  and  implementation  system,  so  achievement  of  national  targets  on \nsanitation  is  behind  schedule.  In  rural  areas,  sanitation  is  often  limited  to  the  construction  of \nhousehold  latrines,  normally  regarded  to  be  the  responsibility  of  households  themselves. \nHousehold,  public  and  school  latrine  programs  have  received  limited  attention  from  political \nleaders.  The  project  will  support  subprojects  that  include  sanitation  improvements  as  well  as \nwater supply.  \n \n20. \nLimited  knowledge  of  the  benefits  of  hygienic  practices.  Although  the  provision  of \nlatrines and sanitation infrastructure brings improved health and environmental outcomes, these \nare  significantly  increased  when  beneficiaries  are  exposed  to  IEC  programs  on  household \nsanitation practices that improve their awareness of the relationship between water, sanitation, \nand hygiene. In addition, considerable health and environmental improvements can be achieved \nby  providing  public  and  school  latrines  and  better  drainage  systems,  all  supported  by  specific \nIEC programs.  \n \n21.  Many  IEC  materials  have  been  developed  in  Viet  Nam.  Supported  by  various  partner \norganizations,  the  government  has  made  an  inventory  of  the  materials  available,  which  have \nbeen evaluated and placed in the public domain for easy reference.12 In 2003, the government \npublished  an  implementation  guideline  on  IEC,  introducing  the  concept  of  a  community \nresponsive approach.13  \n \nThe main lessons learned from previous IEC programs in Viet Nam are that (i) allocated \n22. \nbudgets too small to implement complete IEC programs, including evaluation of impacts; (ii) IEC \nprograms  are  implemented  on  a  short-term  basis  only  and  are  discontinued  following  the \ncompletion  of  construction  of  associated  works;  (iii)  IEC  programs  should  be  extended  to \n                                                 \n11 $80\u2013$100 per capita for water supply and $100\u2013$150 per household for sanitation. \n12 NCERWASS,  supported  by  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  Plan  International.  More  than  500 \n\ndocuments were collected and made accessible through an electronic library. \n\n13 NCERWASS supported by UNICEF and the Danish International Development Assistance. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ninclude  behavioral  change  communication  components,  and  (iv)  IEC  programs  are  effective  if \ndesigned specifically for local awareness and education levels, and for specific socioeconomic \nsituations. The project has allocated an ample budget to support IEC activities over an extended \nperiod  of  time.  These  programs  will  be  designed  specifically  for  each  subproject  following  a \nknowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP)14 assessment by the consultants. \n \n23. \nInsufficient  community  participation.  The  project  will  be  implemented  using  the \ncommunity-based approach (CBA) which will complement the traditional top\u2013down approach of \nthe  government.  The  population  will  be  actively  involved  in  all  phases  of  the  project  cycle. \nImplementation  of  IEC  activities  is  an  effective  way  to  start  CBA  by  raising  awareness  and \ncreating  demand  for  services.  Follow-up  activities  will  focus  on  giving  the  communities  control \nover planning decisions and investment resources, based on principles of local empowerment, \nparticipatory governance, demand-responsiveness, administrative autonomy, greater downward \naccountability, and enhanced local capacity.  \n \n24. \nLack of consistent sector data. RWSS sector-based data, including coverage rates, is \ninconsistent  and  unreliable.  The  data  are  provided  by  different  agencies,  using  different \ndefinitions  and  with  limited  capacity  to  carry  out  comprehensive  surveys.  Under  NTP  II,  the \ngovernment  approved  a  new  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  program  that  includes  eight \nsector-level  indicators  and  six  program-level  indicators.  The  project  will  adopt  these  indicators \nas  part  of  the  project  performance  management  system,  the  implementation  of  which  by \nprovincial and district governments will be supported through a series of workshops.  \n \n25. \nImproved  sustainability  of  water  supply  systems.  The sustainability of water supply \nsystems  depends  on  effective  operation  and  management  of  the  system  and  the  affordability \nand  willingness  of  the  beneficiaries  to  pay.  The  project  will  support  intensive  and  continuous \ntraining of managers and operators of the water supply systems in setting water tariffs that are \nhigh  enough  to  recover  full costs,  following  the  government's  guidelines.15 However,  the  tariffs \nshould be affordable and full cost recovery should not be an excuse for inefficient operation of \nthe water supply system. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n26. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  better  health  and  living  conditions  of  people  living  in \nrural  areas  in  the  project  provinces.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the  RWSS  strategy,  which \nstates  that,  by  2020,  100%  of  the  rural  population  will  (i)  have  access  to  clean  water,  with  a \nminimum volume of 60 liters per capita per day; (ii) use hygienic latrines; and (iii) practice proper \npersonal  hygiene.  The project is designed  as a  sector  investment  project.  It  meets  the  criteria \nfor  sector  lending  since:  (i)  the  RWSS  strategy  forms  a solid  basis  for project implementation,  \n(ii)  NCERWASS  has  proven  capacity  to  implement  RWSS  projects,  and  (iii)  the  policies \napplicable to the water and sanitation sector are appropriate. \n \nThe  outcome  will  be  access  to  clean  water  and  hygienic  sanitation  for  about  350,000 \n27. \nrural people in about 30 communes in the six project provinces in the central coastal region of \nViet Nam: Binh Dinh, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, and Thanh Hoa. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n14 Understanding  the  levels  of  KAP  will  enable  a  more  efficient  process  of  awareness  creation  as  it  will  allow  the \n\nprogram to be tailored more appropriately to the needs of the community. \n\n15 Circular No. 100 /2009/TT-BTC (tariff framework), issued by MOF on 20 May 2009. \n\n\fSelection  of  project  provinces. The selection of the six project provinces was based \n28. \non: (i) the poverty level, (ii) the size of the rural population, (iii) the number of rural residents with \naccess  to  clean  water  and  hygienic  latrines,  and  (iv)  the  percentage  of  ethnic  minorities.  In \naddition to these quantifiable criteria, two more selection criteria were applied: (v) the access to \nsuitable surface and shallow groundwater sources, and (vi) the capacity of local government to \nimplement  the  proposed  project.  The  six  selected  provinces  have  large  poor  rural  populations \nand large ethnic minority populations.16  \n \nSubproject  selection.  The  project  design  is  based  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  six \n29. \nsubprojects,  one  in  each  project  province.  The  subprojects  include  communes  that  are \nrepresentative  of  others  in  terms  of  their  socioeconomic  profiles,  water  supply  and  sanitation \nneeds, and projected impacts.  \n \n30. \nEach  subproject  will  consist  of  one  or  more  communities,  covered  by  a  single  piped \nwater supply system. Each system may cover 300\u22123,000 households or 1,500\u221218,000 people. \nAlthough  classified  as  rural,  the  communities  are  relatively  densely  populated  and  are  mostly \nsituated  around  public  markets  and  along  provincial  roads.  The  subprojects  will  follow  an \nintegrated  approach  to  the  improvement  of  water  supply  and  sanitation,  including  minor \ndrainage improvement.  The project will support a CBA, ensuring the active involvement of the \ncommunities in the preparation, planning, design, construction and operation of the water supply \nand sanitation facilities.  \n \n31. \nIt  is  expected  that  six  to  nine  subprojects  will  be  selected  and  approved  annually. \nApproval  of  the  subprojects  will  be  based  on  a  subproject  appraisal  report  that  includes  (i)  a \nfeasibility study; (ii) required safeguard documents on the environment, resettlement, and ethnic \nminorities; (iii) a CBA-IEC plan; and (iv) a baseline survey covering socioeconomic, health, and \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  coverage  data.  The  capacity  of  the  provinces  to  implement  a \nsubproject will be assessed by ADB, based on the progress made in implementing subprojects \nin  the  previous  batch.  Provinces  that  perform  satisfactorily  may  be  awarded  more  subprojects \nthan provinces that perform poorly. Detailed selection criteria are in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n32. \nOutput  1:  Operational  and  sustainable  piped  water  supply  systems.  By  2016,  24 \npiped  water  supply  systems  will  be  operational,  providing  clean  water  to  about  65,000 \nhouseholds or 350,000 people. Each system will have to comply  with the following standards: \n(i) water will be provided continuously at quantities not lower than 80 liters per capita per day;17 \n(ii)  tap  water  will  be  clean  and  safe  for  human  consumption  without  further  treatment;  \n(iii) the number of breakdowns will be less than four per month and these  will not last more than \n2  hours  each;18 (iv)  the  water  tariff  will  cover  operation,  maintenance  and  depreciation  costs;  \n(v) the water bill per household, based on 80 liters per capita per day, will be less than 3% of \naverage monthly income. \n \n33. \nThe water supply systems will consist of: (i) a raw water source: either a deep well or a \nsurface  water  intake;  (ii)  transmission  mains;  (iii)  treatment  plant;  (iv)  pumping  station  if \n\n                                                 \n16 Average poverty ratio of subprojects is 27% versus 17% national and ethnic minority ratio is 10% versus 6%. \n17 The RWSS strategy prescribes a minimum of 60 liters per capita per day (lcpd). For piped water supply schemes \nwith  house  connections,  a  rate  of  80  lcpd  is  a  more  realistic  design  criteria,  considering  easy  access  to  water \nsupplies.  This  is  supported  by  the  World  Bank's  Red  River  Delta  Water  Supply  Project,  where  the  first  batch  of \nsubprojects  were  designed  for  60  lcpd  which  proved  to  be  not  enough.  The  next  batches  adopted  80  lcpd  as \ndesign capacity. \n\n18  Except in case of force majeure, such as typhoons and flooding. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nrequired;  (v)  central  elevated  reservoir;  (vi)  distribution  system;  and  (vii)  house  connections  or \ncommunal taps, with water meters. Preference will be given to systems operating under gravity \nand  to  reservoirs  located  on  natural  elevations.  The  systems  will  follow  the  \"fill  and  draw\" \nprinciple rather than continuous flow. The project, the government, and beneficiaries will finance \ncapital  investments.  Beneficiaries  will  be  charged  service  fees  to  cover  the  operation, \nmaintenance and depreciation costs. \n \n34. \nThe  government  follows  six  management  models  for  rural  water  supply  operations,  of \nwhich  four  are  considered  to  be  suitable  for  piped  water  supply  systems:19 (i)  the  cooperative \nmanagement  model,  (ii)  the  PCERWASS  management  model,  (iii)  the  private  management \nmodel,  and  (iv)  the  enterprise  management  model.  Viet  Nam  has  limited  experience  of  the \nmanagement of rural water supply schemes by cooperatives, the private sector, or enterprises. \nPiped water supply systems are considered too complex to be managed by cooperatives, while \nno privately operated water supply systems have been identified in the project provinces. The \nWorld Bank promotes the enterprise model despite the absence of lessons to draw upon.20 The \nmost common model is the PCERWASS model, whereby PCERWASS selects local people to \ntrain  these  into  operators.  This  model  has  varying  success  rates,  depending  on  the  quality  of \ntraining  and  educational  background  of  the  selected  operators.  The  project  will  support  the \nPCERWASS  management  model,  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  building  the  capacity  of  the \nmanagement and operational staff, before and during system operations. \n \n35. \nOutput  2.  Improved  household  and  public  sanitation.  By 2016, 65,000 households \nwill (i) have access to hygienic latrines, at home, at school, at commune health centers and at \npublic places; and (ii) benefit from better drainage at home and at public areas.  \n \n36. \nThis  output  will  be  achieved  through  four  main  activities:  (i)  construction  and \nrehabilitation  of  latrines  and  small  drainage  works  at  households;  (ii)  construction  and \nrehabilitation  of  school  latrines;  (iii)  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  latrines  at  health  centers \nand  public  areas;  and  (iv)  construction  of  drainage  works  in  public  areas.  The  household \ndrainage  works  will  properly  discharge  spill  and  gray  water  flows  that  result  from  the  water \nsupply works.  \n \nThe  MOH  has  endorsed  four  types  of  household  latrines:  double  vault  composting \n37. \nlatrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pour flush water-sealed latrines, and latrines with septic \ntanks. The MOET endorses a variety of standard designs for school sanitation blocks, all using \nseptic tanks for wastewater disposal. The project will support double vault composting and pour \nflush  latrines  for  household  use,21 depending  on  cultural  preference,  and  the  MOET-endorsed \nstandard design.  \n \n38. \nThe project will support the construction of household latrines by providing in-kind grants \nand cash credit directly to households. Grants, equal to about 70% of the total latrine investment \n\n                                                 \n19  The  two  other  models  are:  community  management  model  and  management  directly  by  the  provincial  people\u2019s \n\ncommittee (PPC). \n\n20  The World Bank promotes the enterprise model in its Red River Delta RWSS project. A provincial enterprise is set \nup  which  is  in  charge  of  all  rural  water  supply  schemes  in  the  province.  The  enterprise  is  co-owned  by  the  PPC \n(90%)  and  the  communities  (10%)  and  after  equitization  shares  may  be  sold  to  private  entities.  Although  an \nevaluation  is  yet  to  be  carried  out,  three  questions  can  be  raised:  (i)  besides  ownership,  how  do  these  systems \ndiffer  in  terms  of  management  capacity  strengthening;  (ii)  how  are  these  new  enterprises  going  to  deal  with  the \nproblems  of  sector  regulation  which  their  experienced  urban  counterparts  currently  face;  and  (iii)  why  not  merge \nthese  rural  enterprises  with  their  urban  counterparts  to  profit  from  economies  of  scale  and  management \nexperience?  \n\n21 Ventilated  improved  pit  latrines  are  considered  unsuitable  for  densely  populated  areas  and  septic  tanks  are  too \n\ncostly. \n\n \n\n\fcosts, will be provided to poor households.22 The total latrine costs may vary per subproject. In \nflood-prone  areas,  elevated  latrines  will  have  to  be  constructed.  The  grant  will  be  provided \nthrough  the  construction  of  the  latrine  substructure,  to  be  procured  by  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  units  (PPMUs)  through  a  single  works  contract  for  each  subproject.  This  will \nensure  the  quality  and  appropriateness  of  the  technologies,  and  lower  costs  because  of \neconomies of scale. The households will construct the superstructure themselves. Credit will be \nprovided  to  non-poor  households  through  a  revolving  fund,  managed  by  the  provincial  and \ncommune  Viet  Nam  women's  union  (VWU).  23 The  maximum  credit  available  will  equal  the \nestimated  full  costs  of  the  latrine.  Individual  households  will  be  responsible  for  procuring \nmaterials  and  works.  The  provincial  Viet  Nam  women\u2019s  union  (PVWU)  will  be  responsible  for \nensuring the technologies are appropriate and of acceptable quality. School, health clinic, public \nlatrines, and public drainage works will be grant-financed.  \n \n39. \nThe project will support the establishment and training of sludge removal units in areas \nwhere  flood-proof  latrines  will  be  constructed.  Disposal  of  the  sludge  will  be  at  designated \ndisposal  sites  or  composting  stations.  The  sludge  removal  and  disposal  system  will  be \nsupervised by the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) or designated government departments. \nThe operating costs will be borne by the population.  \n \n40. \nOutput  3.  Improved  hygiene  awareness.  In  addition  to  providing  the  infrastructure \nunder outputs 1 and 2, community hygiene awareness will be raised to ensure that benefits are \nsustained following project completion. It is expected that by 2016 at least 90% of the population \nof the project areas will connected to water supply systems and will pay water bills on time. Less \nthan 30% of total water usage will be from alternative water sources. At least 90% of all latrines \nwill be operational and well maintained.  \n \n41. \nThis  output  will  be  achieved  through  three  sets  of  activities:  (i)  increased  community \nparticipation  in  subproject  implementation,  (ii)  formation  and  training  of  water  and  sanitation \ncommune  committees  (WSCCs)  and  support  to  health  and  sanitation  promoters  (HSPs),  and \n(iii) behavioral change for good hygiene practices through IEC.  \n \n42. \nThe project will adopt CBA to mobilize communities and implement IEC activities. Each \nsubproject  will  start  with  an  IEC  activity  promoting  community  awareness  of  health  and \nsanitation, followed by an orientation phase to (i) prepare communities on their involvement in \nthe  various  phases  of  the  project  cycle,  (ii)  establish  the  WSCCs  and  identify  the  HSPs,  and  \n(iii)  identify  the  required  IEC  training  materials  and  approach  based  on  a  KAP  assessment  by \nthe  consultants.  This  will  enable  the  establishment  of  the  implementation  structure  and  an \napproved  CBA-IEC  action  plan,  particular  to  each  community.  The  action  plan  will  include  \n(i)  demonstrated  commitment  of  the  community  to  the  project;  (ii)  an  agreed  community \nparticipation  strategy,  including  benchmarks  and  timelines;  and  (iii)  an  agreed  IEC  plan, \nincluding identification of required materials and training approaches. Approval of this document \nby the PPC and ADB will be a prerequisite for subproject approval. \n \n43. \nThe  CBA-IEC  plan  will  be  based  on  best  practices  in  Viet  Nam.  The  IEC  plan  may \ninclude elements of community-led total sanitation and ecological sanitation, if appropriate. The \nprogram  will  be  implemented  in  selected  subprojects,  leading  to  improved  awareness  of  the \n\n                                                 \n22 Following  classification  of  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs,  the  current  threshold  for  the  rural \n\npopulation is D200,000 per person. The ministry is considering increasing that threshold to D350,000. \n\n23 ADB  has  good  experience  with  revolving  funds  for  sanitation  improvement,  managed  by  PVWUs  under  various \nprojects.  Detailed  guidelines  have  been  prepared  which  will  be  adopted  for  this  project.  The  World  Bank  has \nadopted same approach for its Red River Delta RWSS project. Following the Project closing, the revolving fund will \nbe continued by the VWU and may be extended to include other project areas within the respective provinces, \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nrelationship  between  water,  sanitation  and  hygiene,  behavioral  change,  and  consequently  to \nconsiderable  health  and  environmental  improvements.  Progress  will  be  measured  through  a \nbaseline survey and follow-up surveys.  \n \nThe WSCCs24 will include community leaders, representatives from the commune VWU \n44. \nand  other  mass  organizations,  commune  health  officials,  village  leaders,  men  and  women \nrepresentatives from water users, school teachers and HSPs. At least 40% of the members of \nthe  WSCCs  will  be  women.  Representatives  from  the  village  VWU  and  village  health  workers \nwill be trained as HSPs to mobilize the community for social preparation and to implement IEC \nactivities. At least 50% of the HSPs will be women. The HSPs will cover about 100 households \neach. The PPMU will allocate community funds of $2,000 per 100 households to procure goods \nand works25 for sanitation improvement in the local area. Procurement will be carried out by the \ncommunities, facilitated by the HSPs and approved by the PPMUs. \n \n45. \nThe  project  includes  capacity  building  to  enable  provincial  government  agencies, \nPPMUs, communes and villages to appreciate the importance of CBA and IEC. This is needed \nto promote the participation of communities in planning, implementing and managing water and \nsanitation services.  \n \n46. \nOutput 4. Strengthened sector planning and implementation capacity.  This output \nwill be delivered through three activities: (i) improvement of operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof  water  supply  facilities,  (ii)  effective  M&E  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  investments,  and  \n(iii) capacity building of provincial and commune VWU to manage sanitation revolving funds.  \n \nThe  project's  support  for  improved  O&M  will  improve  the  sustainability  of  water  supply \n47. \nworks  by:  (i) \nimproving  system  management  capacity,  and  (ii)  promoting  community \ninvolvement in monitoring the systems' operations. Generally, operational staff will be selected \nfrom the project communities, based on their educational background and working experience. \nPCERWASS will support these staff in attending training courses, and will continue to provide \nsupport after the systems have been commissioned. The project will support the involvement of \nWSCCs  in  selecting  operational  staff  and  monitoring  the  operation  of  the  system.  Before  the \nnew  facilities  are  handed  over,  operators  will  be  trained  through  course  work  at  training \ninstitutions and on-the job training at well-run piped water supply schemes in the same province, \nor,  if  not  available,  in  other  provinces. 26  Once  systems  are  handed  over  and  operational, \nPCERWASS  will  assign  experienced  staff  to  operate  the  system  for  at  least  a  month \ncontinuously  and  6  more  months  intermittently.  The  project  will  support  (i)  the  training  of  the \nstaff;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  an  operators'  network,  including  operators  from  the  subproject \nareas,  and  other  existing \nrural  and  urban  piped  water  supply  systems;  and  \n(iii)  semiannual  meetings  of  these  networks  to  receive  training  on  a  specific  technical  subject \nand to discuss their own experiences and achievements. \n \n48. \nBy 2016, the M&E program should be operational in the project provinces. The project \nwill  support  \"train  the  trainers\"  courses  for  provincial  and  district  governments,  and  data \ncollection  and  evaluation  training  for  the  subproject  communes.  Baseline  and  annual  M&E \nsurveys,27 including water-related disease data, will be collected by communities and HSPs.  \n\n                                                 \n24 The WSCC will serve as liaison between PPMU and community and will be tasked with endorsing and monitoring \nCBA-IEC action plan, facilitating IEC activities, supporting HSPs, and monitoring contractors. Detailed tasks will be \ndefined as part of CBA-IEC action plan. \n\n25 Goods  may  include  equipment  for  stabilized  sludge  removal  from  composting  toilets.  Works  may  include  small \n\ndrainage improvement works. \n\n26 This may be urban systems operated by water supply enterprises. \n27 Using the M&E indicator set developed by MARD. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\n \n49. \nOutput  5.  Improved  project  management  capacity.  This  output  will  be  delivered \nthrough  two  activities:  (i)  project  orientation  workshops  in  each  province;  and  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment  program  for  PCERWASS,  DOH,  DOET,  PVWU,  CPP,  CVWU,  WSCC,  and  HSPs. \nProject orientation workshops will be conducted in each province to inform key stakeholders about \nthe  project  design  and  eligibility  of  communes  to  participate  in  the  project.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  program  will  focus  on  improving  project  implementation  practices,  including:  \n(i)  RWSS  engineering  and  contract  management;  (ii)  financial  appraisal  and  analysis;  \n(iii) financial management; (iv) hygiene and sanitation awareness; (v) quality control; (vi) social \nand  gender  awareness \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of \nenvironmental,  resettlement,  and  ethnic  minority  safeguard  plans;  (viii)  planning  and  budgeting; \n(ix) accounting and bookkeeping; and (x) procurement. A detailed assessment of training needs \nwill be carried out at the start of the project by the consultants. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n(vii)  preparation, \n\ntraining, \n\nPoverty  focus.  The  project  has  a  strong  poverty  focus:  (i)  subproject  selection  will \n50. \nprioritize communes with high poverty levels; (ii) house connections will be provided at minimum \ncost, 28  allowing  poor  families  to  benefit  equally  from  the  water  supply  services  provided;  \n(iii) poor households29 will be eligible for grants to construct sanitation facilities; and (iv) the IEC \nprogram will be implemented through CBA, encouraging poor households to participate. \n \n51. \nIntegrated  approach  to  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  promotion.  The \nbenefits from access to improved water supply and sanitation infrastructure will be strengthened \nif  behavioral  change  leads  to  improved  hygienic  practices.  The  project  will  only  support \nsubprojects  that  include  investments  in  infrastructure  and  behavioral  change  programs.  The \nproject  will  support  school  sanitation  programs,  since  children  often  educate  their  parents  in \nproper hygiene practices.   \n \n52. \nCommunity-based approach to subproject implementation. To prevent communities \nreturning  to  their  traditional  practices  following  project  completion,  the  subprojects  will  \n(i)  address  community  needs,  (ii)  provide  services,  and  (iii)  remain  affordable  to  the  poor \nhouseholds.  The  project  supports  (i)  capacity  building  and  awareness-raising  of  local \ncommunities,  (ii)  participatory  decision  making  on  communities'  involvement  in  project \nimplementation  and  IEC,  (iii)  community-based  procurement  of  small  sanitation  works  to  meet \nlocal  needs,  and  (iv)  capacity  building  of  government  and  mass  organizations  to  create  an \nenabling environment and strengthen governance relationships. \n \n53. \nInformation,  education,  and  communication  as  a  continuing  activity.  Sustained \nbehavioral change can only be achieved through long-term support. The project will support IEC \nactivities  on  a  continuing  basis  starting  immediately  after  approval  of  the  subprojects  until  6 \nmonths after completion of the construction works. The total duration of the IEC support will be \n3\u20133.5 years. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n54. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $50  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$4.4  million.  The  total  cost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other \n                                                 \n28  Maximum  household  contribution  5%  of  total  investment  cost,  or  about  $18.  This  will  be  charged  after \ncommissioning of the works through deferred payments system.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB \nwill  finance  taxes  and  duties  of  $4.1  million30 while  government  financing  of  $2.6  million  will \ncover resettlement and land compensation, 5% of the cost of the water supply infrastructure,31 \nand  10%  of  the  public  latrines  and  drainage.  It  is  expected  that  this  approach  will  strengthen \nprovincial  government  ownership  of  infrastructure  and  lead  to  lower  contract  costs.  The  taxes \nand  duties  are  not  excessive,  amounting  to  less  than  10%  of  total  project  costs.  The \nbeneficiaries are expected to contribute $2.4 million in cash and kind. The financing plan is in \nTable 5. The project was prepared through a project preparatory technical assistance grant32 of \n$600,000 financed by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund-IV. \n \n\nTable 5: Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nTotal \n45.00 \n2.63 \n2.37 \n50.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n90.00 \n5.27 \n4.73 \n100.00 \n\n                                                 \n30 Only on ADB-financed expenditure. \n31 The  water  supply  works  for  each  subproject,  including  the  house  connections  will  be  constructed  under  a  single \ncontract to be fully financed by ADB (90%) and the provincial budgets (10%).

The  PPMU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  activities  at \nthe subproject level and will be accountable for all related expenditure, including revolving funds \nand community funds. The accounts of the credit scheme will be subject to audit by the project \nauditor recruited by the CPMU. The required legal documents and detailed implementation and \nmonitoring  guidelines  will  be  prepared  by  the  consultants.  The  implementation  arrangements \nare in Appendix 6. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n59. \nIt  is  estimated  that  the  project  will  be  implemented  over  6.5  years,  commencing  in  the \nfirst  half  of  2010.  The  first  year  will  be  used  to  recruit  consultants  and  start  the  community \n\n                                                 \n33 The  procurement  committee  will  include  a  procurement  officer,  an  administration  officer,  and  technical  staff.  The \nteam  leader  and  deputy  team  leader  (or  other  national  consultant  of  the  project  consulting  team)  are  part  of  the \nprocurement  committee  in  an  advisory  role  without  voting  rights.  The  consultant  will  prepare  an  independent \nevaluation report, to be submitted directly to the CPMU and copied to ADB.   \n\n \n\n\fmobilization and IEC activities of the first group of subprojects. With the approval of six to nine \nsubprojects a year, it is expected that the construction of the last batch of subprojects will start \nat the beginning of the fourth year. The construction period will be about 2 years, leaving 1 year \nto  finalize  the  capacity  building  of  the  operational  staff  and  complete  the  IEC  activities.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nAdvance Recruitment of Consulting Services \n\nADB  management  has  approved  advance  recruitment  of  consulting  services.  MARD  can \n60. \npost advertisement and receive expressions of interest and may draft a short list of consultants, \nrequest proposals, and evaluate them.  ADB\u2019s support of advance contracting does not commit \nADB  to  approve  the  loan  project  or  to  finance  the  recruitment  costs.  Contracting  should  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n61. \nGoods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  procurement  contracts  will \ncontain anticorruption provisions as specified by ADB. Procurement will generally be carried out \nby the PPMUs and supported by the international consultant. Civil works above $2,000,000 or \ngoods  above  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works \nwith  value  of  $2,000,000  or  less  and  goods  with  value  of  $500,000  or  less,  will  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding. Civil works and goods with value of $100,000 or less will \nbe procured through shopping. Civil works contracts for household sanitation with a total value \nof $5,000 or less can be procured at the commune level and will follow community participation \nin  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB's  procedures  for  implementing  small  projects  with \ncommunity  participation.  The  experience  with  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  practices \nvaries from province to province. The international consultant will provide support for preparing \nbid  documents,  and  for  the  bidding  process,  including  evaluation.  All  international  competitive \nbidding  and  the  first  two  similar  NCB  civil  works  contracts  in  each  province  will  be  subject  to \nprior review by ADB. The water supply works will be contracted as design build contracts. The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n62. \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Consulting services will include the following packages: \n(i)  general  project  management  to  CPMU  and  PPMUs,  (ii)  technical  design  and  procurement \nservices,  (iii)  preparation  of  safeguard  documents,  (iv)  community  mobilization  and  IEC \nimplementation, and (v) capacity building of water supply system operators. Consulting services \nwill  be  provided  by  one  international  consulting  firm,  recruited  by  the  CPMU,  and  various \nnational consulting firms, recruited by the PPMUs. The firms will provide a total of 1,497 person-\nmonths of consulting time, of which 285 person-months will be for international specialists and \n1,212  person-months  for  national  specialists.  The  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  using  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. The technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% \nand  the  financial  proposals  20%.  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  will  be  applicable  throughout \nthe consulting services. The assets purchased will be handed over to MARD upon completion of \nthe project. The outline terms of reference of consultants are in Appendix 9. \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n63. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MARD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of MARD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the project. \n \nTo  encourage  greater  stakeholder  participation,  transparency  and  accountability,  the \n64. \nproject will (i) strengthen the capacity within the MARD to comply with the project administration \nmanual;  (ii)  use  the  NCERWASS  website  and  the  existing  system  at  the  commune  people's \ncommittee  offices  (notice  board)  to  disclose  information  on  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds, \nincluding procurement data; (iii) notify communities of the date and location of selected events \nin  the  procurement  process  (e.g.,  public  bid  openings,  progress  reviews,  and  hand  over \nceremonies);  and  (iv)  establish  grievance  redresses  mechanisms  at  the  CPMU  and  PPMU \nlevels in each participating province to receive complaints and/or grievances from communities, \ncontractors,  and  others.  The  procurement  data  to  be  disclosed  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  \n(i)  list  of  participating  bidders,  (ii)  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  (iii)  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures, (iv) contract award, (v) list of goods and services procured, and (vi) intended and \nactual utilization of loan proceeds under each contract. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n65. \nPayment of eligible expenditures from loan proceeds will be made either through direct \npayment or imprest account procedures in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Immediately after loan effectiveness, MARD will establish a first-\ngeneration imprest account (FGIA) in Ha Noi, and the six PPMUs will each establish a second-\ngeneration imprest account (SGIA), in a commercial bank designated by State Bank of Vietnam \nand acceptable to ADB. \n \n66. \nThe maximum amount to be deposited into each imprest account shall be equivalent to \nthe estimated expenditure to be funded through each imprest account for the next 6 months of \nproject  implementation,  but  in  any  event  shall  nor  exceed  $4,500,000  for  the  FGIA  and \n$650,000  for  each  SGIA.  The  SGIAs  will  be  replenished  upon  presentation  of  documented \nliquidation of expenditures as outlined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The CPMU may \nuse  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  for  replenishing  the  imprest  accounts  and \nliquidation  of  advance  payment,  provided  that  each  individual  payment  does  not  exceed \n$100,000. \n \n67. \nPayments made directly from the CPMU and PPMUs will be supervised and authorized \nby the treasury at central and provincial levels upon receipt of payment documents. Based on \nthe  payments  authorized  by  provincial  treasuries,  each  PPMU  will  prepare  withdrawal \napplications  with  associated  payment  documents  or  statements  and  the  SGIA  balance  sheet \n(using  the  CPMU  format)  and  submit  them  to  the  CPMU.  Upon  the  receipt  of  reimbursement \napplications  and  payment  documents  from  PPMUs,  the  CPMU  will  prepare  an  aggregated \nwithdrawal  application  and  submit  it  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  endorsement.  Authorized \nwithdrawal applications will be forwarded to ADB for reimbursement to the FGIA.  \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nFunds for the sanitation revolving fund will be disbursed through the PPMU's managed \n\n68. \nSGIAs to the PVWUs.  \n \n69. \nNo  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  to  a  participating  province  if \nmisprocurement has been found by ADB or procurement has been identified as irregular, until \nthe  misprocurement  or  other  irregularity  has  been  corrected  by  the  province  concerned  to  the \nsatisfaction of the government and ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n70. \nThe  CPMU  and  PPMUs  shall  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  project \nexpenditures  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  consultant  team  will  provide \ntraining on the use of the imprest accounts and support to CPMU and PPMU accounting staff. All \nproject  accounts  will  be  audited annually  as  part of the regular audit  by  an  independent auditing \nfirm acceptable to  ADB,  using international  accounting and auditing standards. The  consolidated \naudit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the government's fiscal year. \nThe audit opinion will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control \nsystems  regarding  project  expenditures  and  transactions  to  ensure  safe  custody  of  project-\nfinanced  assets;  (ii)  a  determination  as  to  whether  the  government,  MARD,  and  participating \nprovinces  have  maintained  adequate  documentation  for  all  financial  transactions,  specifically \nincluding the statement of expenditure and imprest account procedures for both first and second \ngeneration  imprest  accounts;  and  (iii)  confirmation  of  compliance  with  the  project  financial \nmanagement system and ADB requirements for project management. A separate audit opinion will \nbe issued on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures.   \n \n71. \nEach PPMU will submit quarterly reports and data to the CPMU within 15 days of the end \nof each quarter. The CPMU will (i) collect and consolidate all project progress reports, site reports, \nand technical and financial reports and submit them to ADB; and (ii) prepare quarterly progress \nreports  within  30  days  of  the  end  of  each  quarter,  a  midterm  project  evaluation  report,  and  an \noverall  project  completion  report.  The  quarterly  report  will  include  (i)  a  narrative  description  of \nprogress  made  during  the  reporting  period;  (ii)  modifications,  if  any,  to  the  implementation \nschedule;  (iii)  details  of  land  use  and  resettlement;  (iv)  information  on  environmental  screening;  \n(v) major project activities by CPMU, PPMUs and PVWUs; (vi) financial and procurement-related \ninformation;  (vii)  problems  experienced  and  remedial  actions  proposed;  (viii)  the  work  to  be \ncarried out during the upcoming reporting period; and (ix) a summary of expenditures during the \nquarter, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures to date. A project completion report will \nbe prepared by the CPMU and submitted to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the \nproject.  All  reports  and  associated  financial  accounts  and  data  will  be  presented  to  ADB  in  the \nEnglish language. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n72. \nA project performance management system will be developed based on the government's \nM&E system and implementation procedures, expanded to ensure that it meets the performance \nand  safeguard  reporting  needs  of  the  proposed  project,  including  basic  health  indicators.  A \nbaseline  survey  will  be  conducted,  as  part  of  the  IEC  action  plan.  The  communes  will  be \nresponsible  for  data  collection  and  will  be  assisted  and  trained  by  the  project  consultants.  The \nPPMUs  will  consolidate  these  data  and  will  provide  the  CPMU  with  quarterly  reports  on  their \n(i) activities, (ii) compliance with safeguard requirements, and (iii) progress toward output targets. \nThe  CPMU  will  consolidate  these  into  a  quarterly  progress  report  that  will  be  finalized  and \ncirculated to ADB, MARD, and MOH, within 1 month of the end of the reporting quarter. Selected \ndata  will  be  disaggregated  by  sex,  household  income,  and  ethnic  group  where  feasible  and \n\n\fapplicable.  Annual  project  performance  management  system  reports  will  be  prepared  by  each \nPPMU, then consolidated by the CPMU and submitted to ADB.   \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n73.  MARD and ADB will conduct joint loan reviews at least twice a year and a comprehensive \nproject  review  about  30  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  comprehensive  project  review  will \nevaluate  (i)  the  actual  progress  of  each  project  output  in  each  province;  (ii)  implementation \narrangements  and  procedures;  (iii)  role  of  commune  committees  and  commune  promoters  in  \nfurthering project implementation; (iv) procurement procedures; (v) progress and effectiveness of \ncapacity  development  programs;  (vi)  the  functioning  and  performance  of  the  CPMU,  PPMUs, \nPVWUs,  and  consultants,  (vii)  the  financial  performance  and  cost  recovery  of  water  supply \nschemes and revolving funds; and (viii) effectiveness of safeguard procedures. Remedial actions \nwill be agreed to address the problems identified. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n74. \nPoverty and social impacts. About 27% of the population of the central coastal region \nlived  in  poverty  in  2006,  compared  with  16%  in  Viet  Nam  as  a  whole. The  monthly  per  capita \nincome was lower than the national average. About 70% of the population lives in rural areas. In \nthe  subproject  areas,  44%  of  the  labor  force  is  engaged  in  agriculture  and  the  poverty  rate \nranges from 15.5% to 34.5%. \n \n75. \nEquitable  access  to  clean  and  affordable  water  continues  to  be  a  critical  issue  in  rural \nareas of Viet Nam. In the subproject areas, all households will be provided with clean water and \nsanitation  services \nin  an  equitable  and  affordable  manner.  The  project  will  provide \napproximately  350,000  people  with  access  to  clean  water  and  hygienic  sanitation  facilities. \nAccess to clean water and sanitation by households will improve public health, especially child \nhealth,  and  will  reduce  medical  expenditures.  By  targeting  remote  rural  areas,  the  project  will \nbenefit populations with high poverty levels.  \n \n76. \nEthnic minorities. The number of ethnic groups in the project provinces varies from 3 to \n28.  The  groups  include  the  Ba-na,  Bru-van-kieu,  Ca  Rai,  Cham,  Chut,  Co  Tu,  Edo  Nagi,  Gia \nRai, Gie Trieng, Hoa, Khemer, Moung, Nung, Tay, Thai,  Tho Dao, and, Xe Dang.  However, the \npercentage of ethnic minority people in the project provinces is relatively small (ranging from 2% \nto 14%), except for the subproject area of Quang Nam Province, which has a population that is \n80% Co Tu and a poverty rate of 60%.  \n \n77. \nThe  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  provinces  are  integrated  into  the  mainstream \npopulation  in  terms  of  language,  schooling,  and  clothing.  The  subprojects  will  not  have  any \nadverse cultural effects on these groups. The ethnic minority people will benefit from both the \nwater and the sanitation services provided by the project. To ensure that ethnic minority people \nparticipate equally, have a voice in the planning of water sanitation facilities, and receive equal \nbenefits from the project, an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) will be prepared for each \nsubproject in areas where more than 50% of the population is from ethnic minorities. An ethnic \nminority  development  framework  is  included  in  the  project  for  the  preparation  of  EMDPs. \nSubprojects where less than 50% of the population is from ethnic minorities will include actions \nspecifically  targeted  at  such  groups  in  the  subproject  design.  For  the  subproject  in  To  Vieng \ncommune  of  Tay  Giang  District  in  Quang  Nam  Province,  an  EMDP  has  been  prepared.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nGender  impacts. Women provide most of the labor in the collection and use of water. \n78. \nThey are also usually responsible for taking care  of sick family members. Access to improved \nwater services and sanitation facilities will have a positive impact on family health and will allow \nwomen  to  spend  more  time  on  productive  activities.  The  CBA  of  the  project  will  provide  an \nopportunity for women to participate in planning water and sanitation services. Women's active \ninvolvement  in  planning  community  water  and  sanitation  facilities  will  increase  their  voice  in \ncommunity affairs.  Specific attention will be given to targeting women in implementing the IEC \nfor  behavioral  change.  The  capacity  of  VWU  will  be  developed  to  mobilize  the  community  to \ncreate demand for water and sanitation services, and to implement IEC. The WSCCs and their \nworking  groups  will  be  at  least  40%  women,  and  will  include  representatives  from  the  VWUs, \nHSPs,  and  the  communities.  In  addition,  at  least  50%  of  the  HSPs  will  be  women.  A  project- \nspecific  gender  strategy  will  ensure  women's  participation  in  planning  and  implementation  of \nwater and sanitation facilities and in building the capacity of the women's union, and staff of the \nPPMU to secure the active involvement of women in the project activities. The summary gender \nanalysis and action plan is in Appendix 11. \n \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  main  resettlement  impacts  created  by  the \n79. \nproject will be the permanent loss of land for the construction of water supply plants and minor \ndamage to structures, crops and trees and the temporary loss or disruption of the use of land \ncaused by the construction of pipelines. Most permanent acquisition will be limited to land that is \npublicly owned and reserved for infrastructure purposes, although some permanent acquisition \nwill be required along the pipeline route where it traverses private agricultural land. Where the \npublic land is currently used for other purposes, the users of the land will be offered alternative \nland so they are no worse off as a result of the project. \n \n80. \nThe six PPCs will be responsible for resettlement plan preparation and implementation. \nThe  resettlement  plans  for  the  six  core  subprojects  will  need  to  be  updated  once  the  final \ndesigns  have  been  completed.  Upon  completion  of  detailed  designs,  a  detailed  measurement \nsurvey  will  be  completed,  which  will  confirm  the  number  of  affected  people  and  the  extent  of \nimpact.  Compensation  rates  will  be  updated  for  all  categories  of  lost  assets  and  allowances \nbased on replacement cost surveys undertaken at that time. The updating of resettlement plans \nand  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  for  other  (as  yet  unidentified)  subprojects  will  be \nundertaken by the project implementation consultant with the support of the respective PPCs.  \n \n81. \nA  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  address  the  other  subprojects  in \naccordance with ADB policy. The resettlement framework contains key components including a \ndefinition  of  the  cutoff  date,  an  entitlement  matrix,  the  process  for  preparation  of  future \nresettlement  plans,  minimum  requirements \nfor  surveys  (detailed  measurement  survey, \nsocioeconomic  survey  and  replacement  cost  survey),  consultation,  grievance  redress  and \ndisclosure  requirements,  controls  relating  to  vulnerability,  gender  and  ethnicity,  institutional \narrangements, M&E requirements, and an implementation schedule. The summary resettlement \nplan and resettlement framework is in Appendix 12. \n \n82. \nEnvironmental  impacts.  The  environmental  classification  of  the  project  is  category  B. \nBased  on  the  results  of  the  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  the  subprojects  are \nunlikely to cause significant adverse environmental impacts since they are intended to improve \nthe  quality  of  environment  and  living  standards  of  rural  communities  in  the  subproject  areas. \nBenefits  include  the  increase  in  the  number  of  houses  connected  to  clean  and  reliable  water \nsupply  for  drinking  and  sanitation,  minimized  or  eliminated  flooding  and  stagnation  of \nwastewater,  and  improved  personal  sanitation.  The  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts \nassociated with design, construction and operation of the subprojects will be small and localized \nand  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  proper  engineering  design  and  implementation  of \n\n\fmitigation  and  monitoring  measures  identified  in  the  IEEs.  An  environmental  assessment  and \nreview framework (EARF) has been prepared for future subprojects. \n \n83. \nEconomic  benefits.  Six  sample  subprojects  were  selected  for  the  feasibility  study.  The \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the pilot subprojects range from 13.4% in Quang \nNam  to  23.0%  in  Nghe  An.  These  projections  suggest  that  all  six  subprojects  examined  are \neconomically  viable,  since  their  EIRRs  are  all  well  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital of 12% for the benefits that have been quantified. \n \n84.  Major quantifiable benefits attributable to the project include: (i) nonincremental benefits \n(water  supplied  by  the  project  will  replace  most  of  the  water  sources  currently  used  by  the \nhouseholds);  (ii)  incremental  benefits  (beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  and \nexpanded  water  services  and  their  consequent  increase  in  water  consumption);  (iii)  user  cost \nsavings  (as  a  result  of  lower  costs  for  water  storage  and  boiling  and  filtration);  and  (iv)  time \nsavings  in  the  collection  of  water.  The  economic  costs  of  the  pilot  subprojects  include  capital \ncosts (including land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation and monitoring \ncosts) and O&M costs (including the costs of replacing depreciated equipment). \n \n85. \nFinancial management capacity. The financial management capability of NCERWASS \nis adequate to implement the project. Training in ADB disbursement procedures will be provided \nby the project. The financial management capacity of PCERWASS varies, but in general needs \nstrengthening.  The  project  implementation  consultants  will  review  the  financial  information \nsystems  and  procedures  of  PCERWASS  and  propose  modifications.  The  consultants  will  \n(i)  draft  terms  of  reference  for  external  auditors,  (ii)  prepare  a  financial  management  plan,  \n(iii)  assist  in  implementing  this  plan,  (iv)  prepare  a  training  program,  and  (v)  develop  a \nmethodology  for  periodic  reviews  of  the  water  supply  tariff.  The  PPMU  staff  will  be  trained  in \nADB loan processing and policies and related procedures for procurement and disbursement. \n \nRisks  and  mitigation  measures.  The  following  are  potential  risks  for  the  project:  \n86. \n(i)  poor  households  may  not  be  able  to  afford  water  supply  tariffs  at  full  cost  recovery;  \n(ii)  local  government  agencies  may  be  unable  to  implement  CBA  and  the  gender  strategy  or \nmay  resist  doing  so;  (iii)  implementation  of  IEC  activities  may  take  a  traditional  top-down \napproach instead of intensive community mobilization; (iv) women, poor people, and members \nof  ethnic  minorities  may  be  marginalized  in  decision  making  and  the  planning  of  water  and \nsanitation  facilities  at  the  community  level;  (v)  beneficiaries  may  not  adopt  hygienic  behavior, \nwhich may reduce some of the benefits of the project; and (vi) water supply facilities may not be \nsustainable because of low water tariffs and improper O&M. \n \n87. \nTo mitigate these risks, communities will be involved in the preparation, implementation, \nand  monitoring  of  water  supply  works,  so  facilities  are  appropriate  to  the  community  needs. \nIndividual households will be targeted to raise awareness of the importance of hygiene for family \nhealth and so they can contribute labor and local materials for building latrines. Training will be \nprovided  to  local  governmental  agencies,  community  facilitators,  and  commune  water  and \nsanitation  committees  so  they  can  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  effectiveness  of \ncommunity  mobilization  for  implementing  IEC  CBA,  and  the  EMDP,  for  planning,  and  for \nensuring  the  equal  participation  of  men  and  women  in  decision  making  for  community \ninvestments  in  water  and  sanitation.  Monitoring  indicators  that  are  disaggregated  by  poverty, \nethnicity,  and  gender  will  be  included  in  the  project  monitoring  system.  The  community \nfacilitators will be trained in community mobilization and implementation of IEC and to monitor \nhygienic  behavior.  The  appropriateness  and  affordability  of  the  water  supply  systems  will  be \nassessed  during  project  implementation  and  discussed  with  the  communities,  following  the \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fCBA. The project will support the PPCs to set water tariffs to cover operation, maintenance and \ndepreciation costs, and to train operators to run the systems efficiently. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  and  MARD  have  given  the \n\n88. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nO&M of water supply facilities. MARD and the PPCs will ensure that (a) the water \ntariffs  will  cover  the  cost  of  O&M  and  depreciation  of  the  water  supply  facilities,  \n(b) the systems are operated efficiently, and (c) management and technical support is \nprovided  to  the  operational  staff  of  the  water  supply  facilities  to  ensure  continued \nO&M of the water facilities beyond project period. \nO&M of sanitation facilities. The PPCs will ensure that (a) O&M funds will be raised \nthrough either user fees or school fees, or provided from provincial budgets; and (b) \nschool, health clinics, and public latrines  will  be  maintained  properly beyond project \nperiod.  \nSanitation  revolving  funds.  MARD  and  the  PPCs  will  support  the  PVWUs  to \nmanage  the  sanitation  revolving  funds  effectively  and  efficiently  beyond  the  project \nperiod.  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MARD  and  the  PPCs  shall  have \nreviewed and approved the revolving fund implementation guidelines. \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Water and sanitation commune committees. MARD and the PPCs will facilitate \nthe  establishment  of  these  committees  and  ensure  their  composition  as  agreed \nbetween  the  government  and  ADB.  MARD  and  the  PPCs  will  support  their \ncontinued existence and effective functioning beyond the project period.   \nGender.  The  borrower  will  ensure  that  the  executing  agencies  will  implement  the \nprovisions set forth in the project specific gender action plan and CBA prepared for \nthe  project  as  agreed  upon  between  the  borrower  and  ADB.  The  specific  targets \nare:  (a)  WSCCs  will  include  40%  women  members,  (b)  construction  of  separate \ntoilets facilities for girls and boys in school and separate toilets for male and female \nin the health centers and public places, (c) revolving loan fund to women's union, \n(d)  at  least  50%  of  the  HSPs  are  female,  (e)  formation  of  one  men  and  one \nwomen's group in the village for community mobilization and IEC implementation, \n(f) IEC is implemented through commune and village women's union, (g) under the \nEMDP,  women  from  all  the  households  are  trained  in  home  gardening  using \ncompost from sanitation program, (h) all  female headed households receive grant \nfor households latrines, (i) recruitment of 30% professional female staff for PPMU, \n(j)  capacity  building  training  of  the  project  management  include  30%  professional \nstaff,  and  (k)  RWSS  database  and  monitoring  indicators  for  hygiene  behavior \ndisaggregated by gender. \nEnvironment.

The National Rural Clean Water \n1. \nSupply and Sanitation Strategy to 20201 was developed by the Ministry of Construction and the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD).  The  strategy  was  approved  by  the \nPrime Minister on 25 August 2000.2 \n  \n2. \nIn  developing  the  strategy,  the  importance  and  context  of  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation (RWSS) were recognized: 75% of the national population is rural and predominantly \npoor,  and  better  RWSS  is  needed  to  achieve  better  public  health,  living  conditions,  and \nenvironment. As a result, RWSS was made one of seven national target programs in 2000. At \nthe  time,  only  30%  of  the  population  had  access  to  water  that  met  basic  hygiene  criteria,  and \nonly 20% of rural households had hygienic latrines. Investment in RWSS was only 10% of the \namount needed, understanding of good hygienic practices was low, and use of fresh excreta as \nfertilizer  was  common.  In  addition,  RWSS  programs  were  fragmented,  with  little  coordination \namong  ministries  and  departments  and  a  weak  legislative  environment  with  respect  to \nregulations and guidelines for the management of RWSS.   \n \nThe strategy sets ambitious targets for physical infrastructure, 100% coverage for both \n3. \nclean  water  supply  and  hygienic  latrines  by  2020,  but  without  identifying  the  specific  projects, \ntotal investments, or sources of funds that might be required to achieve these objectives.  \n \nEvaluation of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation National Target Program I (2001\u2013\n4. \n2005).  The  RWSS  strategy  was  implemented  over  the  period  2001\u20132005  as  a  national  target \nprogram (NTP I). At the conclusion of RWSS NTP I, a sector status report was developed by a \ngovernment\u2013partner  organization  review  team  and  issued  in  January  2005.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) was part of the team. The report represents the most comprehensive \neffort seen to date to evaluate RWSS at the national level. In particular, it places RWSS within \nthe perspective of the rapid economic development of Viet Nam in recent years.  \n \nThe  evaluation  of  NTP  I  revealed  that  progress  had  been  made:  (i)  water  supply \n5. \ncoverage  was  extended  to  23  million  people;  (ii)  3.7  million  more  households  were  using \nhygienic  latrines;  (iii)  a  newly  introduced  sanitation  campaign  led  to  improvements  in  hygienic \npractices;  (iv)  the  number  of  schools,  commune  health  clinics,  and  rural  markets  with  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  facilities  increased;  (v)  funding  sources  were  diversified  (43%  from \nbeneficiaries, 22% from central budget, 16% from international partner organizations, and 19% \nfrom  other  sources);  and  (vi)  legal  documents  and  guidelines  were  prepared  to  encourage \ndifferent  economic  sectors  to  invest  in  the  sector  and  to  stimulate  a  diversification  of \nmanagement models. \n \n6. \nIt  was  also  concluded  that  the  water  supply  coverage  targets  for  2010  and  2020  are \nlikely to be met provided existing efforts were maintained. However, there was little prospect of \nmeeting the sanitation targets. Because households have had to pay to build their own latrines, \nthe  poor  lag  far  behind  better-off  households  in  coverage  rates.  The  review  also  stressed  the \nthe  poorest \nimportance  of \n\ntargeting  government  and  partner  organization  support  at \n\n                                                 \n1 MARD. 2000.

The team felt that the key issues included: (i) the legal, \npolicy,  and  regulatory  environment;  (ii)  coordination  among \nthe  government,  partner \norganizations,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  (iii)  decentralization  policies;  \n(iv)  socialization  and  private  sector  participation;  (v)  community  participation;  (vi)  information, \neducation,  and  communication  (IEC);  (vii)  sustainability  of  finances  and  operation  and \nmaintenance; (viii) monitoring and evaluation of RWSS facilities, and (ix) links to public health \nand economic development. \n \nRural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  National  Target  Program  II  (2006\u20132010).

This \naddressed the issues identified in the evaluation of NTP I: (i) improved institutional structure and \ncoordination among stakeholders to ensure more targeted investments; (ii) decentralization and \nlevels;  \nbuilding  capacity \n(iii) development of coherent legal, policy, and regulatory settings, including greater involvement \nby  communities  and  the  private  sector;  (iv)  greater  focus  on  sanitation  by  strengthening  IEC \nactivities  as  an  integral  part  of  any  RWSS  program;  (v)  establishing  a  range  of  investment \nfinancing mechanisms; (vi) increasing participation by local communities; and (vii) strengthening \nthe monitoring and evaluation of RWSS data. \n \n9. \nNTP II aims to provide access to clean water for an additional 14.7 million people and to \npromote the construction of hygienic latrines for an additional 2.6 million households.

Based on the results, a decision will be taken on whether the current 5-\nyear national target program will be extended, or will be designated in a different manner.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  institutional  structure  of  the  RWSS  is  complex.  There  are  a  number  of  different \n12. \nagencies  and  programs  in  addition  to  the  RWSS  NTP  II  that  are  part  of  national  efforts  to \nachieve  RWSS  coverage  and  poverty  targets.  Decentralization  means  that  provinces  have \nsubstantial  autonomy  with  regard  to  budgets  and  responsibility  for  planning  and  activity \nimplementation.  \n \n13.  MARD  is  the  lead  agency  for  RWSS.  It  has  delegated  the  responsibility  for \nimplementation of programs financed by partner organizations to the National Center for Rural \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  (NCERWASS).  The  government-funded  NTP  II  program  is \nadministered  by  the  national  standing  office  based  in  the  Department  of  Water  Resources \nManagement in MARD.  \n \n14. \nfinanced  by  partner \norganizations,  including  those  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency \ninclude: \n(JICA),  NCERWASS  undertakes  various  support  activities.  These \nimplementation of a monitoring and evaluation system for RWSS; development of management \nmodels  for  piped  water  systems  (e.g.,  user  groups,  cooperatives,  and  public  utilities); \npreparation of introductory material on RWSS technologies; and development of operation and \nmaintenance guidelines for various types of water supply systems. \n \n15. \nThe Ministry of Finance is responsible for recurrent budget allocations to NTPs, financial \ncontrols,  and  release  of  funds  to  provinces.  The  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investments  in \nconsultation with the Ministry of Finance proposes budget allocations for approval by the Prime \nMinister and the National Assembly.  \n \n16. \nThe  Ministry  of  Health  is  responsible  for  developing  awareness  on  hygiene  and  health \nand for setting and monitoring water quality standards. The Ministry of Education and Training is \nresponsible  for  health  and  hygiene  programs  in  schools.  Responsibilities  are  delegated  to  the \nprovincial departments of these ministries: departments of health and departments of education \nand training. \n\nimplementation  of  programs \n\nto  managing \n\nIn  addition \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nProvincial people's committees manage resources and coordinate the implementation of \n\n \n17. \nRWSS investments. Typically this is devolved to the provincial office of PCERWASS.  \n \nInstitutional  constraints.  The  provincial  authorities  are  the  key  executing  agencies. \n18. \nHowever,  they  (i)  lack  familiarity  with  the  RWSS  strategy  and  the  principles  affecting \nsustainability,  (ii)  have  a  tendency  to  focus  on  water  and  ignore  sanitation,  (iii)  lack  technical \ncapacity,  (iv)  focus  on  meeting  construction  targets  rather  than  functional  targets,  and  \n(v) are unfamiliar with demand responsive approaches. \n \n19. \nLack  of  coordination  and  limited  capacity. Although at the national level there is an \nagreement  between  MARD,  MOH,  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  to  coordinate \nRWSS activities, this has not led to coordination at the provincial level. Implementation capacity \nvaries significantly from province to province and there is no strategic plan to build capacity.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n \n\nMajor Development Partners: Strategic Foci and Key Activities  \n\nA. \n \nThe Rural Water Supply Sector (RWSS) in Viet Nam is supported by over 100 agencies. \n1. \nThe main development partners in the sector are the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), \nthe World Bank, Danish International Development Assistance (Danida), the Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA). \nTheir current programs are listed in Table A3.1. \n \n2. \nUNICEF's involvement in the RWSS dates from the early 1980s. It has a strong focus on \ndeveloping technical, managerial and policy capacity in national agencies, mass organizations, \nand  communities.  It  has  successfully  introduced  community-based  sanitation  models,  notably \nthe  intensive  sanitation  promotion  model,  and  it  provides  support  to  the  National  Center  for \nRural and Clean Water and Environmental Sanitation in developing information, education and \ncommunication materials.  \n \n3. \nThe World Bank supports the sector primarily through the Red River Delta Water Supply \nand Sanitation Project, focusing on piped water supply schemes following demand-responsive \napproach and principles of the national RWSS strategy.  \n \n4. \nThe  two  main  partner  organizations  are  Danida  and  AusAID,  who,  with  support  of  the \nNetherlands, will provide budget support for the implementation of the National Target Plan II. In \naddition,  they  are  providing  technical  assistance  to  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment (MARD) to prepare legislation and technical guidelines.  \n \n5. \nUnion supports RWSS through integrated rural development projects. \n \n6. \nOver  40  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  are  active  in  the  sector  in  about  40 \nprovinces, more so in water than sanitation. This is often as an element of more broadly based \ndevelopment  support  than  through  focused  projects.  NGOs  have  been  successful  in  fostering \ncommunity  participation  and  demand-responsive  approaches,  but  because  of  their  small-scale \nand  local  focus,  lessons  have  only  been  mainstreamed  into  national  programs  to  a  limited \ndegree. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  joint  government-donor  review  of  National  Target  Plan  I  concluded  that  there  is  a \nlack of coordination among the government, partner organizations, and NGOs. In 2006 MARD \nand  several  partner  organizations,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  established \nthe Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Partnership (RWSSP). The objective of the partnership \nis to maximize the efficiency of resource utilization within the sector through collaborations that \nwould  harmonize  the  many  policies  and  programs  in  existence.  The  partnership  has  regular \nmeetings to discuss the development progress of the sector in general and to discuss regulatory \nand technical issues. It also provides a forum for development partners to share lessons learned \nthrough the circulation of a bimonthly newsletter.  \n \nThe  RWSSP  is  guided  by  a  steering  committee  consisting  of  representatives  of  the \n8. \nvarious  relevant  ministries,  such  as  MARD,  Ministry  of  Construction,  Ministry  of  Health,  and \nMinistry of Education and Training. The daily activities are implemented by a coordinating unit, \n\nJICA  provides  assistance  for  groundwater  resource  development  and  the  European \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nAchievements, Issues and Recommendations  \n\nestablished  within  MARD  and  through  specific  technical  working  groups.  The  partnership  has \nand active website, holds regular meetings and produces a bi-monthly newsletter. \n \n9. \nOne of the principal tasks before the RWSSP is to help formulate the Unified Sanitation \nSector  Strategy  and  Action  Plan,  since  sanitation  (rural  and  urban)  has  been  identified  as  a \npriority issue in Viet Nam. The Water and Sanitation Program is one of the lead organizations in \nthe  consultative  team  responsible  for  engaging  with  the  relevant  government  agencies \npreparing the sanitation strategy. ADB, too, is participating in this endeavor. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nADB's history of financing the water supply and sanitation sector in Viet Nam has mainly \nfocused  on  urban  areas.  ADB's  goals  include  sustainable  environmental  management  and \ninclusive  social  development  under  its  Strategy  2020.1   Its  support  for  RWSS  will  help  ADB \nachieve its goals of providing access to infrastructure by rural communities and improving living \nstandards.    The  proposed  project  will  allow  ADB  to  actively  support  the  review  of  the  national \nRWSS  strategy,  develop  a  capacity  building strategy,  and  seek  cooperation  with  development \npartners through the RWSSP. \n \n11. \nIn formulating the project, ADB has extensively consulted with the development partners \nthrough  formal  consultations  and  informal  consultations.  The  RWSSP  has  substantially \ncontributed to discuss and align the various partner approaches.  \n \n12. \nA main issue to be discussed further is the issue of a possible sector wide approach, or \nbudget  support  as  provided  by  Danida,  AusAID,  and  the  Netherlands.  Although  this  approach \nwas  considered  for  this  project  as  well,  the  limited  implementation  capacity,  especially  at \nprovincial  level,  was  seen  as  a  major  risk.  Also,  the  fiduciary  risks  were  considered  to  be  too \nhigh. \n \n13. \nThrough  a  continuous  dialogue  with  partners  and  the  government  and  based  on  the \nlessons learned of the development partners, this issue should be further explored and possibly \nadapted in future ADB intervention in the RWSS sector in Viet Nam. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2008.

The project will start with orientation workshops in the project \nprovinces. These will enable district governments to introduce the project, its objectives and the \neligibility  criteria  for  subproject  selection.  Following  these  workshops,  districts  can  submit  their \nproposed subprojects to the provincial project management unit (PPMUs). \n \n2. \nIn order for subprojects to be eligible, they have to demonstrate that piped water supply \nsystems  with  a  central  water  source  are  the  most  economical  way  of  supplying  water  in  the \nsubproject areas and that they comply with the following criteria.  \n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCommunes  have  relatively  high  population  densities.  Human  and  animal  waste \ndisposal are likely to contaminate shallow ground water layer. \nShallow groundwater layers are polluted, making the water unfit for consumption \nor requiring extensive treatment. Pollutants include salinity, fluoride, arsenic, and \niron.  \nSuitable  readily  accessible  drinking  water  sources  are  scarce.  The  shallow \ngroundwater  or  nearby  surface  water  sources  have  too  little  yield  in  the  dry \nseason  to  sustain  the  requirements  of  the  population,  leading  to  a  drying  up  of \nshallow groundwater wells, surface streams, and springs. \n\n \n3. \nThe existence of one or a combination of these situations will justify the exploitation of \nraw water sourced from deep groundwater layers, or located outside the subproject area, and of \na central water treatment facility.  \n \n4. \nprioritized based on the following criteria and weighting: \n\nOnce  a  shortlist  of  subprojects  has  been  established,  the  potential  subprojects  will  be \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\npoverty ratio (40%), \nethnic minority ratio (30%), and \nRWSS coverage ratios (30%). \n\n \n5. \nThe  highest  ranked  subprojects  with  similar  final  scores  will  be  reviewed  and  the  final \nranking will be based on the per capita investment costs1 and the readiness for implementation. \nThe six sample subprojects covered by the project preparatory technical assistance 2 have been \ngiven the highest priority on the shortlist, since they comply with the eligibility criteria and are in \nan advanced stage of readiness. \n \n6. \nApproval  of  subprojects.  Following  the  preparation  of  the  shortlist,  final  approval  of \nsubprojects  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  based  on  a  subproject  appraisal \nreport that includes (i) a feasibility study; (ii) financial and economic analysis; (iii) a commitment \nletter from the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) to ensure the financial sustainability of the \nwater  supply  system;  (iv)  required  safeguard  documents  on  environment,  resettlement,  and \nethnic  minorities;  (v)  a  community-based  approach  and \ninformation,  education,  and \ncommunication (CBA-IEC) plan; (vi) an agreement between the PPMU and Subproject CPCs on \nthe  level  of  customers'  contribution  and  payment  mechanism  for  the  water  supply  works;  and \n(vii)  a  baseline  survey  covering  socioeconomic,  health,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \ncoverage data.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Lower per capita investment costs will allow for more beneficiaries. \n2   ADB.  2008.

These connection charges may only be levied once \nthe systems have been  commissioned and the charges must be affordable. Nonpayment  may \nnot lead to disconnection of the customers. A deferred payment system is preferred.  \n \n9. \nThe  CBA-IEC  plan  will  include:  (i)  demonstrated  commitment  by  the  community  to  the \nproject;  (ii)  an  agreed  community  participation  strategy,  including  benchmarks  and  timelines; \nand  (iii)  an  agreed  plan  for  IEC,  including  identification  of  required  materials  and  training \napproaches. \n \n10. \nIt is expected that the 24 subprojects will be implemented over 3 years, with six to nine \nsubprojects  implemented  each  year.  The  capacity  of  the  provinces  to  implement  a  subproject \nwill be assessed by ADB on the progress made in implementing subprojects under the previous \nbatch. Provinces that perform well may be awarded more subprojects than those that perform \npoorly. \n \nPreparation  of  subprojects. Following the approval of the  subproject, implementation \n11. \nstarts  with  (i)  setting  up  the  community  participation  structure  and  implementing  the  CBA-IEC \nactivities,  (ii)  social  preparation  and  training  of  the  Viet  Nam  women's  union  for  sanitation \nimplementation and operation of revolving funds, and (ii) preparation of the bidding documents. \n \n12. \n \n\nThe project will help to establish water and sanitation commune committees that  \n\ninclude  the  commune  leader,  representatives  from  the  commune  Viet  Nam \nwomen's  union  and  other  mass  organizations,  commune  health  officials,  village \nleaders, male and female representatives from the water users, school teachers \nand health and sanitation promoters; \nhave a membership that is at least 40% female; and \nhave three  working groups: a water users group, a community mobilization and \nIEC Implementation group, and an operation and maintenance group.   \n\nThe project will help to train teams of health and sanitation promoters that \n\nconsist  of  representatives  from  the  village  Viet  Nam  women's  union  and  village \npublic health workers; \ncan  mobilize  the  community  for  social  preparation  and  to  implement  IEC \nactivities; \nhave a membership that is at least 40% female; \nwill cover approximately 100 households per promoter; and  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n13. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n38  \n \n\n \n14. \nthat:  \n \n\n(v) \n\nwill  be  assigned  a  budget  of  $2,000  per  promoter  to  procure  goods  and  works3 \nfor  sanitation  improvements  by  households  under  the  supervision  of  the  water \nand sanitation commune committee. \n\nThe project will help to formulate and implement CBA-IEC program for each subproject \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ncovers  household  and  school  sanitation  and  is  based  on  best  practices  in  Viet \nNam, \nincludes  elements  of  community-led  total  sanitation  and  ecological  sanitation, \nand \nwill start after subproject approval and continue until 6 months after completion of \nphysical  construction  with  progress  measured  through  a  baseline  survey  and \nfollow-up surveys. \n\n                                                 \n3  Goods  may  include  equipment  for  stabilized  sludge  removal  from  composting  toilets.

AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\n     Country/Project Title: Viet Nam/Central Region Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project  \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/Energy and \nWater Division \n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  framework  for all  poverty  reduction  activities in Viet  Nam is  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth  Strategy  (CPRGS),  which  recognizes  that  access  to  clean  and  safe  water  and  sanitary  toilets  is  a \nprecondition  for  poverty  reduction,  specifically  for  Viet  Nam's  rural  population.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  average  gross \ndomestic product growth of 7.8% per year between 2002  and 2007 reduced the poverty rate from 28.9% to \n16.0%, but it did not close the gap between urban and rural areas. The poverty rate in rural areas (where 72% \nof the people live) is still 20.4%. In targeting rural areas this project will benefit populations with high levels of \npoverty.  The  project  will  facilitate  poor  households'  access  to  project  benefits  by  providing  them  with  water \nconnections.  \n \nThe  project  will  improve  the  health  and  welfare  of  household  beneficiaries,  hasten  the  reduction  of  rural \npoverty, and help to close urban\u2013rural income gap. The provision of clean water will improve the quantity and \nquality of marketable production, particularly from arable crops, livestock husbandry and fishing, which are the \nprimary  income  sources  of  poorer  households.  The  project  responds  to  the  key  challenges  identified  in  the \nADB's country strategy and program, 2007\u22122010:a  to promote socially equitable and balanced development, \nsustainable  environmental  management,  and  institutional  capacity  strengthening.  It  likewise  supports  the \nmajor targets of Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u22122010b and the Vietnamese Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDG).  These  include  reducing  poverty  to  10%\u201311%,  creating  8  million  new  jobs  and \nfacilitating  the  adoption  of  clean  technologies  and  pollution  minimization  facilities.  Providing  clean  water  will \nreduce the need to boil water for consumption, thereby reducing the demand for firewood. This will contribute \nto the government target of increasing forest cover.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (MDG) \n \n1. Key Issues \n \nOne reason for the comparatively higher poverty in rural areas is the slow growth of agriculture, which is still \nthe backbone of the rural economy. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries have 55% of the employed population \nbut grew by only 3.8% per year between 2001 and 2005. In contrast, industry grew by 10.2% and services by \n7.0%  during  the  same  period.  However,  agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries  still  accounted  for  21%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s 2006 gross domestic product. The economy of all project areas and communities is predominantly \nagricultural.  Poverty  within  rural  area  varies,  with  those  provinces  that  are  more  dependent  on  agriculture \nhaving a higher poverty rate. It also varies among ethnic groups within provinces, with minority groups being \nmuch  poorer.  The  poverty  rate  among  ethnic  minorities  was  estimated  to  be  60%  in  2005.  These  groups \ngenerally live in rural areas and are more dependent of agriculture than the rest of the population.  \n \nA total of 24 subprojects in 30 communes in six provinces  will  be selected. They cover  a range of activities \naimed at securing the sustainable provision of potable water and human waste management services to rural \ncommunities. The targeted communities have poverty rates ranging from 6.2% (Quang Binh) to 60% (Quang \nNam).  Four  of  the  targeted  sites  have  poverty  rates  higher  than  the  national  average  of  16.0%.  One  of  the \ncore subprojects is the To Vieng town center of A Tieng commune, Tay Giang district in Quang Nam Province \nwhich has a large ethnic minority population. Ethnic minorities constitute 57.3% of the commune population. \nThe poverty rate in the To Vieng is 60%.  \n \nThe targets in Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 include increasing the proportion of \nthe population with access to fresh water in urban areas to 95% and in rural areas to 85%. Another target is to \ncreate a favorable environment for development of enterprises, with the focus being on raising the quality and \nefficiency of their production and business operations. Activities to achieve this target include reviewing and \ndeveloping strategies for ensuring a sustainable supply of clean water and sanitary waste management. Other \ntasks  to  which  the  project  will  contribute  include  enhancing  the  development  of  disadvantaged  regions  and \nareas  with  ethnic  minorities,  implementing  information  education  and  communication  programs,  and \npromoting public health and hygienic behavior.   \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10   55 \n\n2. Design Features.  \n\nThe  project  has  a  strong  focus  on  poverty.  It  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  not  just  by  providing  clean \nwater supplies and sanitation services but also by targeting the poor.  Poor households will receive free initial \nwater  connection.  Villagers  from  ethnic  minorities  will  be  consulted  to  determine  the  most  suitable  technical \ndesigns  for  water  infrastructure.  The  component  on  improved  household  and  public  sanitation  will  provide \npoor households  with grants to  construct sanitation  facilities.  In  addition,  the  water and  sanitation  commune \ncommittee (WSCC)  will mobilize other government poverty programs to maximize the benefits of the project \nfor the poor households. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nRural  water  supply  and  sanitation  is  a  particularly  important  concern  in  Viet  Nam  as  some  38%  of  the  rural \npopulation  still  lacks  access  to  piped  drinking  water.  Even  where  piped  water  is  available,  it  often  does  not \nmeet  safety  standards.  Pollution  from  salinity  intrusion,  livestock  waste,  commercial  waste,  and  agricultural \nchemicals  is  increasingly  endangers  public  health.  Up  to  half  the  cases  of  communicable  diseases  in  Viet \nNam are related to poor water supply and sanitation. \n \nThe  provinces  in  the  Central  Region  have  poverty  levels  that  are  higher  than  the  national  average; \ninvestments  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  by  local  governments  are,  therefore,  limited.  In  the  region,  only \n10% to 15% of households are served by a private tap or public standpipe. About half of households obtain \nwater from shallow dug wells, which are easily susceptible to bacterial contamination and saline intrusion, and \n20%\u201325%  of  people  in  the  central  region  receive  water  from  relatively  expensive  private  deep  wells.  The \nregion suffers from water shortages in the dry season and contaminated supplies from flooding of dug wells in \nthe  wet season. Groundwater is heavily exploited for the irrigation of cash crops, resulting in frequent  water \nshortages. Shallow groundwater contains high levels of salinity, turbidity, hardness, fluoride, iron, manganese, \naluminum,  and  pollution  from  humans,  industry,  and  livestock.  Surface  water  is  often  affected  by  turbidity, \norganic matter, and pollution by surface runoff that contains microorganisms and agricultural chemicals. River \nwater  in  the  lower  reaches  is  polluted  by  industry  and  settlements  upstream.  As  a  result,  many  rural \nhouseholds,  particularly  those  with  ethnic  minority  populations,  have  little  choice  on  their  source  of  drinking \nwater  and  they  are  sometimes  forced  to  buy  water  from  vendors  or  fetch  water  from  long  distances  at  high \ncosts. Poor households have to use highly polluted water for many of their daily water needs. \n\n \nThe low per capita consumption and low population density in remote areas makes attaching the communes \nto regional  water supply services a financially unattractive proposition. However, most of these communities \nhave good potential to establish a local water supply service that can be developed to meet local demand for \nclean water.   \n\n \n\nIn  the  project  areas,  people  complain  about  the  poor  quality  of  available  water  supplies.  Complaints  range \nfrom a bad smell to high particle content. Households in three project provinces also report an annual water \nshortage.  Sanitation  facilities  vary  among  communes  and  70%\u201390%  of  households  use  pit  latrines.  Waste \nwater  and  solid  wastes  are  generally  disposed  of  by  being  used  as  fertilizer  on  arable  land  or  are  tipped, \nuntreated, into the nearest river or pond.  Only 25% of people in the project area reported washing their hands \nafter  using  toilets.    Cholera,  diarrhea,  malaria,  dengue  fever,  parasitic  worms,  skin  diseases,  and  child \nmalnutrition  are  common  in  the  project  area.  Sporadic  outbreaks  of  cholera  and  other  water-associated \ndiseases within the project areas lead to the loss of many days work and absence from school. In focus group \ndiscussions  in  the  core  subprojects,  46%  of  respondents  reported  that  children  could  not  attend  schools \nsometimes  because  of  water  related  sickness.  A  major  benefit  of  choosing  the  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices sector is that it will improve community health. As a result it will increase the supply of labor available \nfor economic development activities and reduce the school time lost by children due to sickness.  \n\nProviding  opportunities  for  communities  to  access  improved  services  may  not  automatically  result  in  their \nadoption. The IEC campaign can play a significant role in raising awareness, changing hygiene behavior, and \nmotivating people to pay for monthly water bills. The Quang Nam project area is being promoted as a model \nvillage. A principal benefit of living here is that each house was supplied with a flush toilet. As a consequence, \nthe  number  of  work  and/or  school  days  lost  to  sickness  is  now  insignificant.  Emphasis  will  be  given  to \nplanning an effective IEC implementation plan for the project. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10    \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.    Consultation  and  project  disclosure  meetings  were  held  in  all  communes  in  each  of  the  project  areas. \nSeparate  meetings  were  held  with  government  officers  at  both  provincial  and  district  levels.  Ethnic  minority \ncommunities were represented in the meetings in Quang Nam Province. A focus group discussion was held \nwith women to get their perspective on the water and sanitation situation.   \n \n2.    What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nNo separate plan has been prepared. However, a community-based approach is included in the project and \ncommunity  participation  activities  are  mainstreamed  through  the  water  and  sanitation  committees  of  the \ncommunes,  the  implementation  of  an  information  and  education  campaign,  and  community  mobilization \nactivities.  \n \nThe  community  participation  activities  are  included  in  the  resettlement  framework,  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment framework and the gender action plan.  A budget will be prepared for each subproject and will \nbe financed by loan funds. The common key features of the  community participation are:     \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nrepresentation  of  the  local  community,  including  members  of  ethnic  minorities  and  women  in \ndecision-making bodies, through water and sanitation committees of communes; \nIEC  will  be  conducted  in  each  subproject  with  the  active  involvement  of  the  community  and \ncommunity mobilization will be undertaken through village health promoters; \n\n(ii)  consultations  will  be  carried  out  in  designing,  implementing,  and  monitoring  the  subprojects  and \n\nimpact avoidance and mitigation measures;  \n\n(iv)  project personnel and contractors will be oriented on the community-based approach; \n(v) \n\nrepresentatives of affected households, including women and members of ethnic minorities, will be \ninvolved as part of groups monitoring project activities at the community level and beneficiaries will \nbe consulted during  overall  project  monitoring  to  validate data  and  provide  views  and suggestions \non issues unfolding during implementation; and     \n\n(vi)  community  consultation  will  be  carried  out  during  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and \n\nindigenous peoples\u2019 development plan for the subprojects. \n\n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n\n \nIn core subproject areas, women bear most of the responsibility for the productive work and household chores \nthat require water. The socio-economic survey which was carried out during project preparation revealed that \nwomen walk 3 to 7 kilometers daily and spend 3 to 4 hours daily to collect water. In the project area \nwaterborne diseases are common and women are the primarily responsible for taking care of family health. \nThe same survey revealed that 29% of women often got sick and could not attend work.   The time taken \naway from productive activities affects the quality of their lives. Access to improved water service and \nsanitation facilities would have a positive impact on family health.  \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014\naccess to and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-\nmaking process: \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n   Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nThe following is the summary of the gender strategy from the gender action plan in Appendix 11. \n \nThe community-based approach of the project provides opportunities for women to participate in the planning \nof  water  and  sanitation  services.  Women's  active  involvement  in  planning  community  water  and  sanitation \nfacilities will increase their voice in community affairs. Since women are responsible for family health, they will \nbe  targeted  in  implementing  the  IEC  for  behavioural  change.  During  community  meetings,  women  will  be \nprovided  with  project-specific  information  on  free  household  connections  and  sanitation  grants  for  poor \nhouseholds.  Village  women's  unions  will  mobilize  the  community  to  create  demand  for  water  and  sanitation \nservices and for the implementation and monitoring of IEC. \n \nThe  provincial  women\u2019s  union  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  revolving  loan  funds  for  sanitation \nimprovement.  Through  the  commune  women\u2019s  union,  the  provincial  women\u2019s  union  will  promote  public \nawareness of the revolving loan fund, identify poor households eligible for sanitation grants, process loan  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10   57 \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures \nIncluded in \nDesign \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n     Resettlement \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action.  \n   Indigenous \nPeoples \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action. \nIncluded in the \nconstruction \ncontractors\u2019 \ncontract. \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\nAwareness \ncampaign \nIncluded in the  \ncontractors\u2019 \ncontract. \n\napplications, channel payments and collect repayment, maintain accounts and records, and monitor sanitation \nfacilities financed through the loan fund and grant.  \n \nFor resettlement activities, women will be consulted in the consultation and disclosure meeting.

Hanoi. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f   58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY GENDER ANALYSIS AND ACTION PLAN \n \n\n1. \nRural water supply and sanitation is an important concern as about 38% of the rural \npopulation still lacks access to piped drinking water. The Central Region Rural Water Supply \nand  Sanitation  Sector  Project  will  bring  significant  benefits  to  rural  households  in  project \nprovinces.  The  primary  objective  of  the  project  is  to  develop  the  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation  subprojects  initially  in  six  provinces  of  Central  Viet  Nam.  The  main  components \ninclude  the  development  of  (i)  sustainable  community-based  pipe  water  systems;  (ii) \nimproved  household  and  public  sanitation  systems;  (iii)  community-based  information, \neducation,  and  communication  for  health  and  hygiene  behavior;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  relevant  stakeholders.  The  project  will  provide  clean  water  and \nsanitation  facilities  to  about  65,000  households.    A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been \nprepared  to  ensure  that  the  different  needs  of  men  and  women  are  incorporated  in  the \nplanning  of  community  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  that  men  and  women \nparticipate meaningfully in the project components. The GAP will ensure equal opportunities \nfor  men  and  women  in access  to  project  benefits. It  is  based  on the  gender analysis  done \nduring the preparation of the project and is designed according to ADB's Policy on Gender \nand  Development  (1998).  The  GAP  will  be  implemented  by  the  provincial  project \nmanagement unit (PPMU) supported by a gender specialist, recruited under the consultant's \ncontract.  The  gender  specialist  will  work  with  district  women's  union,  commune  women's \nunion and commune water and sanitation committee to implement the GAP.  \n \nA. \n\nBackground \n\n2. \nThe total population of Viet Nam is 86 million, of whom 50.8% are women. Women \nconstitute 49% of the labor force. The population in the project area is predominantly rural \n(78%).  The  Vietnamese  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets  in  the  rural  water  and \nsanitation sector include access to national standard clean water with volume of 60 liters per \nperson  per  day  for  85%  of  the  rural  population  and  hygiene  latrines  for  70%  of  rural \nhouseholds.  \n \n3. \nViet Nam has made progress in improving gender equity and equality. Gender issues \nin  government  policy  on  rural  water  and  sanitation  are  addressed  by  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and by the Gender Strategy in Agriculture and \nRural Development.1  The gender objectives of the strategy are to  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nissues \n\nindustrialization  and \n\nincrease  awareness  of  gender \nmodernization of agriculture and rural areas following a socialist orientation; \nincrease  rural  women's  access  to  and  control  of  key  resources,  including \nland, credit, water, infrastructure, and public services; \nintegrate  gender  targets  and  sex-disaggregated  monitoring  and  evaluation \ntools  in  policies,  plans,  programs  and  development  projects  of  the  ministry \nand the sector; \nachieve  gender-sensitive  practices  and  gender  equality  in  agricultural \nresearch, public services and training; and \nincrease  women's  empowerment  and  access  to  decision-making  in  key \ninstitutions  including  MARD,  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment,  people\u2019s  committees  at  all  levels,  agricultural  universities, \ninstitutes, colleges, vocational schools and enterprises. \n\n                                                 \n1  Issued  under  the  Decision  of  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  No.  4776  QD-BNN/TCCB, \n\ndated 28 October 2003. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11  59 \n\nB. \n\nGender and Water Use and Hygiene Behavior \n\n4. \nIn  the  core  subproject  area,  women  bear  most  of  the  responsibility  related  to \nproductive work and household chores that require water. The socioeconomic survey which \nwas carried out during project preparation revealed that women walk 3 to 7 kilometers daily \nand  spend  3  \u2212  4  hours  daily  to  collect  water.  In  the  project  area,  waterborne  disease  is \ncommon  and  women  are  primarily  responsible  for  taking  care  of  family  health,  which \noccupies a significant amount of their productive time. The same survey revealed that 29% \nof women often got sick and could not attend work. Limited access to water and sanitation \nfacilities  in  the  rural  areas  is  also  a  health  and  safety  risk  to  women  and  girls.  Although \nwomen  provide  most  of  the  labor  in  collection  and  use  of  water,  they  have  little  power  in \ndecision  making  on  water  and  sanitation  planning.  Most  programs  on  water  and  sanitation \ndo not include women in the planning and implementation phase. Information education and \ncommunication programs often do not target women adequately.   \n \n5. \nAt the national level, 33% of the management staff of the standing office for National \nTarget  Plan  II  of  MARD  are  women.  However,  in  the  project  provinces  this  figure  is  only \n18%.

A  separate  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  each  subproject.  These \nresettlement plans will serve as a model for subsequent resettlement plans for other subprojects \nunder the sector loan. \n \n2. \nBased  on  the  likely  level  of  resettlement  impacts,  the  subprojects  will  be  category  B \nunder  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nAccordingly,  only  short  resettlement  plans  will  be  required.  The  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (PPTA)  consultant  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  have \nprepared  a  resettlement  plan  for  each  of  the  core  subprojects.  These  documents  involve \nidentification  of  affected  households  and  potentially  affected  households  in  each  of  the \nprovinces. The extent (e.g., area of land and type of asset) and type (temporary or permanent) \nof  impacts  were  also  identified.  The  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in  consultation  with \naffected  people  and  will  be  fully  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy (2005).  \n \n3. \nA  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  address  the  other  subprojects  in \naccordance  with  ADB  policy.  The  key  components  are:  definition  of  the  cutoff  date,  an \nentitlement matrix, the process for preparing future resettlement plans, minimum requirements \nfor  surveys  (detailed  measurement  survey,  socioeconomic  survey,  and  replacement  cost \nsurvey),  consultation,  grievance  redress  and  disclosure  requirements,  controls  relating  to \nvulnerability,  gender  and  ethnicity,  institutional  arrangements,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nrequirements, and an implementation schedule. \n \nB. \n \n \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts\u2014Core Subprojects \n\nTien Loc Commune, Han Loc District, Thanh Hoa Province \n\n1. \n\nActivities in this commune will require 7,536 m2 of permanent and 4,000 m2 of temporary \n4. \nland  acquisition.  Of  the  permanent  land  acquisition,  2%  is  residential  land,  68%  is  public  land \nleased for agricultural purposes, 5% is publicly-owned land leased for fish or shrimp ponds and \n24% is forest land. Land acquisition affects 124 households. There is no demolition of houses or \nstructures required, and no impacts on institutions or commercial premises. \n\n2. \n\nDien Yen Commune, Dien Chau District, Nghe An Province \n\n \n \nActivities  in  this  commune  will  require  32,000  m2  of  permanent  and  1,502  m2  of \n5. \ntemporary  land  acquisition.  Of  the  permanent  land  acquisition,  31%  is  public  land  leased  for \nagricultural purposes and 69% is fish or shrimp ponds. Land acquisition affects 48 households. \nNo  demolition  of  houses  or  structures  will  be  required,  and  there  will  be  no  impacts  on \ninstitutions or commercial premises. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n4. \n\n3. \n\nThanh Trach Commune, Bo Trach District, Quang Binh Province \n\nThach Bang and Thach Kim Commune, Loc Ha District, Ha Tinh Province \n\n \n \nActivities  in  these  communes  will  require  4,900  m2  of  permanent  and  28,162  m2  of \n6. \ntemporary  land  acquisition.  None  of  the  permanent  land  acquisition  is  residential land,  98%  is \nnonagricultural  land,  and  2%  is  public  land.  Land  acquisition  affects  175  households.  No \ndemolition of houses or structures will be required, and there will be no impacts on institutions or \ncommercial premises. \n \n \n \nActivities in this commune will require 7,500 m2 of permanent and 1,008 m2 of temporary \n7. \nland  acquisition  required.  All  of  the  permanent  land  acquisition  is  public  land.  Temporary  land \nacquisition affects 113 households. No demolition of houses or structures is required, and there \nwill be no impacts on institutions or commercial premises. \n \n \n \nActivities  in  this  commune  will  require  7,157  m2  of  permanent  and  22,324  m2  of \n8. \ntemporary  land  acquisition.  Of  the  permanent  land  acquisition,  5%  is  agricultural  land,  5%  is \nforest  land,  89%  is  nonagricultural  land,  and  1%  is  public  land.  Land  acquisition  affects  13 \nhouseholds. No demolition of houses or structures is required, and there will be no impacts on \ninstitutions or commercial premises. \n \n \n\nTay Thuan and Tay Giang Communes, Tay Son District, Binh Dinh Province \n\nTo Vieng Commune, Tay Giang District, Quang Nam Province \n\n6. \n\n5. \n\nActivities  in  this  commune  will  require  2,048  m2  of  permanent  and  12,718  m2  of \n9. \ntemporary  land  acquisition.  Of  the  permanent  land  acquisition,  83%  is  agricultural  land,  and \n17%  is  residential.  Land  acquisition  affects  150  households.  No  demolition  of  houses  or \nstructures is required, and there will be no impacts on institutions or commercial premises. \n\nThe  land  acquisition  requirements  and  loss  of  crops  as  a  result  of  the  land  acquisition \n\n10. \nrequirements for the 6 core subprojects are summarized in Tables A12.1 and A12.2.  \n \nC. \n\nLegal and Policy Framework \n\n11. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  of  the  project  are  based  upon  Vietnamese \nlegislation,  principally  the  Land  Law,  2003;  Decree  197/CP,  2004  modified  in  2006  to  cover \ncompensation,  support,  and  resettlement  when  land  is  recovered  by  the  State;  Circular  116, \n2004 on guiding the implementation of Decree 197; and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  and  Public \nCommunications.  With  the  promulgation  of  Decree  197/CP,  2004  and  Decree  17/2006,  the \ngovernment\u2019s  policy  and  legal  framework  on  resettlement  has  moved  much  closer  toward  the \nprinciples underlying ADB\u2019s policies.  \n\nIn  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures \n12. \nand ADB's policies and requirements, ADB's policies and requirements will prevail. This is also \nin  accordance  with  Decree  131/2006  which  stipulates  that  for  projects  financed  by  overseas \ndevelopment assistance, partner organizations\u2019 policies apply. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\nD. \n\nEthnicity, Vulnerability and Gender Issues \n\n13. \nOne  of  the  core  subprojects  (Quang  Nam  Province)  is  located  in  an  area  with  a \nsubstantial ethnic minority population. Of the six villages in the project area, five are completely \npopulated by members of ethnic minorities, while 20% of the population in Ag Rong (the district \ncapital) is from an ethnic minority.  A separate ethnic minority development plan  was prepared \nfor this subproject and it found that land acquisition would not adversely affect livelihoods as the \nextent of acquisition will be minor. \n\nIncome Restoration Measures \n\nResettlement Plan Preparation and Implementation \n\nA project gender action plan has been included in the resettlement framework to address \n\n14. \nThe  resettlement  framework  establishes  specific  actions  to  address  ethnic  minority \nissues  and  those  affecting  other  vulnerable  households  which  may  be  affected  by  future \nsubprojects. \n \n15. \nresettlement-related issues, particularly those associated with women. \n \nE. \n \n16. \nNo  relocation  is  required  for  this  project,  and  land  acquisition  is  relatively  minor. \nAccordingly,  no  specific  income  restoration  measures  have  been  designed.  Socioeconomic \nimpacts  will  be  carefully  monitored  by  an  external  monitoring  agency  and,  should  future \nsubprojects  have  negative  livelihood  impacts,  suitable  income  restoration  measures  will  be \ndeveloped.  The  entitlement  matrix  includes  a  transition  allowance  to  assist  in  protecting \nlivelihoods should it be necessary for affected households to participate in such a program. \n \nF. \n \n17. \nThe  six  provincial  peoples  committees  (PPC)  will  be  responsible  for  resettlement  plan \npreparation and implementation. The resettlement plans for the six core subprojects will need to \nbe updated once the final designs have been completed. Upon completion of detailed designs, \na  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  completed,  which  will  confirm  the  number  of  affected \npeople and the extent of impact. Compensation rates will also be updated for all categories of \nlost assets and allowance based on replacement cost surveys undertaken at that time. Updating \nof  the  resettlement  plans  and  preparation  of  any  resettlement  plans  for  other  (as  yet \nunidentified)  subprojects  will  be  undertaken  by  the  project  implementation  consultant  with  the \nsupport of the respective PPCs. \n \nG. \n  \nAffected people were involved in focus group discussions and individual meetings during \n18. \nresettlement plan preparation. The aim of this consultation was to present preliminary designs of \nthe  water  supply  system,  the  potential  impacts,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  proposed  entitlements,  institutional  arrangements  and \nimplementation schedule. The concerns and suggestions provided by the affected people during \nthis process were then incorporated in the resettlement plans.  \n \n19. \nresettlement framework will be fully disclosed prior to project appraisal. \n \n \n \n\nA  public  information  booklet  has  been  prepared  and  the  resettlement  plans  and \n\nInformation Disclosure, Community Consultation and Local Participation \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\nH. \n \n20. \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  unit  will  be  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  of \ncompensation and allowance activities. Progress reports will be submitted to ADB every quarter. \nAn independent monitoring agency specialized in social sciences will be recruited and mobilized \nbefore  commencement  of  any  compensation  activities,  including  the  detailed  measurement \nsurvey. The agency will be required to submit quarterly reports on the progress of compensation \nand income restoration program implementation and make any necessary recommendations.   \n  \nI. \n \n21. \nThe resettlement entitlements have been designed to cover compensation of all losses \nand  other  allowances.  Severe  impacts  are  not  anticipated  as  a  result  of  this  project,  but,  to \nensure  a  framework  exists  should  such  an  impact  be  experienced  in  future  subprojects,  the \nentitlement  matrix  in  the  resettlement  framework  provides  entitlements  for  severely  impacted \nhouseholds. \n \n22. \n\nThe key project entitlements are included in Table A12.3.\n\nResettlement Entitlements \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \ne\nc\nn\ni\nv\no\nr\nP\n\nTien Loc \nDien Yen \nThach Bang/ \nThach Kim \nThanh Trach \nTo Vieng \nTay Thuan/ \nTay Giang \n\nTable A12.1.1:  Summary of Land Acquisition by Type \n\nResidential \n\nNonagriculture \n\nAgriculture \n\nForest \n\nPublic land  \n\nTotal \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(\n \nt\nn\ne\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nP\n\n151 \n \n \n\n \n \n348 \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n(\ny\nr\na\nr\no\np\nm\ne\nT\n\n \n \n2,630 \n\n1,008 \n \n \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(\nt\nn\ne\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n(\ny\nr\na\nr\no\np\nm\ne\nT\n\n \n \n4,800 \n\n \n \n600 \n\n \n\n \n6,369  19,585 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(\nt\nn\ne\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nP\n\n5,135 \n9,788 \n \n\n \n342 \n1,700 \n\nFish/ Shrimp \nPond \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n(\ny\nr\na\nr\no\np\nm\ne\nT\n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(\nt\nn\ne\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(\nt\nn\ne\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n(\ny\nr\na\nr\no\np\nm\ne\nT\n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(\nt\nn\ne\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nP\n\n3,000 \n1,502 \n21,782 \n\n412 \n22,213 \n \n\n1,000 \n \n \n\n1,838 \n \n \n\n \n \n2,700 \n\n \n \n100 \n\n \n1,141 \n12,718 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n388 \n \n\n \n\n1,540 \n \n\n7,500 \n58 \n\n \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n(\ny\nr\na\nr\no\np\nm\ne\nT\n\n \n \n \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n(\ny\nr\na\nr\no\np\nm\ne\nT\n\n \n \n450 \n\n \n58 \n \n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(\nt\nn\ne\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n)\n\n2\n\nm\n(\ny\nr\na\nr\no\np\nm\ne\nT\n\n7,536 \n32,000 \n4,900 \n\n4,000 \n1,502 \n28,162 \n\n7,500 \n7,157 \n2,048 \n\n1,008 \n22,324 \n12,718 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n\nUnit \nm2 \n\ntree \n\n \n\n \n\nType \nAnnual \ncrop \nPerennial \ntree \n\nBanana \ntree  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank\n\nTable A12. 2:  Summary of Land Acquisition Impacts on Crops and Trees \n\nTien Loc \n(Thanh Hoa) \n8,135 \n\nDien Yen (Nghe \nAn) \n11,290 \n\n \n\nThach Bang \n(Ha Tinh) \n22,418 \n\nThanh Trach \nCommune \n(Quang Binh) \n147 \n\nTo Vieng \n(Quang Nam) \n342 \n\nTay Thuan/Tay \nGiangc (Binh \nDinh) \n10,780 \n\nTotal \n 53,112 \n\n460 \n\n \n\n22,213 \n\n9,071 \n\n132 \n\n150 \n\n745 \n\n 32,771 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncluster \n\n \n\n \n\n480 \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n483 \n\n  \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n\ni\n\n \n\n6\n5\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\nTable A12.3:  Summary Entitlement Matrix for the Six Core Subprojects and for the Resettlement Framework  \n(See full entitlement matrixes in the six core subproject resettlement plans and the project resettlement framework) \n\nA.
