The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting \nRural  Electrification  through  Renewable Energy,  and if the  Board approves the  proposed loan \nand  administration  of  the  grants,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA.2   \n \n2. \nThe  project  is  designed  to  assist  Nepal\u2019s  energy  sector  development  by  facilitating  (i) \nexpansion  of  domestic  power  transmission  capacity,  (ii)  power  exchange  with  India,  (iii) \naugmentation  and  expansion  of  the  distribution  networks,  and  (iv)  mini-grid-based  renewable \nenergy  access  in  rural  areas.3 The  project  is  prioritized  as  part  of  the  South  Asia  Subregional \nEconomic  Cooperation  Program\u2019s  Power  Generation  and  Transmission  Master  Plan  and \nRegional Cooperation Business Plan, 2014\u20132016.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNepal  is  facing  chronic  power  shortages.  Only  65%  of  the  country\u2019s  households  have \naccess  to  electricity\u201456%  through  the  national  grid  and  9%  through  off-grid  solutions.  Per \ncapita electricity consumption is 102 kilowatt-hours per year, one of the lowest in the world. The \ninstalled  capacity  is  762  megawatts  (MW),  well  below  the  peak  demand  of  1,095  MW.  As  a \nresult, consumers connected to the national grid experience scheduled power cuts of 12 hours \nper  day  or  more  during  the  dry  season.  With  the  expected  commissioning  of  six  hydropower \nprojects with a combined capacity of 732 MW in the next 3 to 6 years and more than 1,500 MW \nof  additional  capacity  being  developed,  a  wet  season  supply  surplus  is  anticipated  by  2018.5 \nHowever, the limited power transmission and distribution network is becoming  a bottleneck for \nmeeting domestic power demand, as well as power trade with neighboring countries.  \n \n4. \nThe Government of Nepal has set the following key targets to be met by year 2027: (i) \nincreasing per capita electricity consumption to 400 kilowatt-hours per year, (ii) commissioning \n4,000 MW of generation capacity, (iii) providing electricity to 75% of the population through the \nnational  grid  and  25%  through  decentralized  generation  solutions,  and  (iv)  developing \nexportable  power  capacity.6 Steps  have  been  taken  to  meet  these  targets:  a  master  plan  for \nhydropower  with  annual  storage capacity  has  been  prepared;  the transmission  system  master \nplan  is  being  updated;  a  distribution  system  and  rural  electrification  master  plan  has  been \noutlined  by  the  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA);  and  a  long-term  agreement  for  bulk  power \ntrading  with  India  is  being  negotiated.  Parallel  institutional  improvements  are  needed.  An \nincremental  retail  tariff  increase  of  20%  during  2002\u20132012  improved  NEA\u2019s  financial  position, \n\n                                                \n1  Under  the  Scaling  Up  Renewable  Energy  Program  in  Low-Income  Countries  financed  by  the  Strategic  Climate \n\nFund. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory  TA.

Manila. \n5  The total installed capacity will be more than 3,000 MW against the projected peak load of 2,052 MW in FY2020. \n6  Government of Nepal. 2010. Three Year Interim Plan (2010\u20132013). Kathmandu. \n\n\f2  \n\n  \n\nbut  it  is  still  weak  because  tariffs  do  not  reflect  costs.7 In  addition,  system  planning  capacity \nneeds to be improved; NEA\u2019s generation, transmission, and distribution departments need to be \nring-fenced8 as a precursor to further corporate restructuring; and a fully independent regulatory \nagency needs to be established.  \n \nTo achieve the 25% electrification target through off-grid solutions, the government has \n5. \nenacted policies and plans such as the Rural Energy Policy 2006, Subsidy Policy for Renewable \n(Rural) Energy 2009\u20132013, Renewable (Rural) Energy Subsidy Delivery Mechanism 2013, and \nDelivery Mechanism of Additional Financial Support to Micro/Mini Hydro Project 2011. Enabling \nmeasures such as targeted grants (subsidies) and exemption of renewable energy projects from \ncertain  licensing  requirements  have  been  set  up.  These  activities  are  being  coordinated  and \nimplemented  under  the  National  Rural  and  Renewable  Energy  Program,  a  government-led \n\u201csingle window\u201d program for off-grid renewable energy supported by development partners.  \n \n6. \nThe project will contribute to Nepal\u2019s energy development objectives by (i) scaling up the \non-grid and off-grid renewable energy supply, (ii) facilitating cross-border power exchange, (iii) \nincreasing access to renewable energy in rural areas, and (iv) building capacity for on-grid and \noff-grid power sector development. The on-grid components will be able to evacuate 2,000 MW \nof new generation outputs along the Kali Gandaki corridor and Marsyangdi corridor9 to the main \nload  centers  at  Kathmandu  Valley,  and  facilitate  at  least  1,200  MW  of  power  exports  to  India \nonce  the  second  400  kilovolt  (kV)  cross-border  transmission  line  from  Bardaghat  (Nepal)  to \nGorakhpur  (India)  is  connected.10 Half  of  the  exports  will  come  from  the  Upper  Marsyangdi  2 \nHydropower  Project,  which  is  to  be  developed  by  GMR  Group,  India.  The  off-grid  component \nwill provide access to electricity and facilitate productive energy use activities in rural locations \nwithout connections to the national grid, increasing the income and welfare of rural communities \nby using renewable energy mainly for agriculture, rural enterprises, health, and education.11 The \nproject  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for \nNepal, which aims to (i) improve inclusive electricity access, (ii) develop renewable energy, (iii) \npromote  regional  cooperation,  and  (iv)  strengthen  sector  governance. 12  The  sector  and \nprogrammatic context of the project is presented in a supplementary document.13 \n \nADB  interventions. In 2009, 2011, and 2013, ADB approved four projects14 to address \n7. \nthe  immediate  needs for  the  power  sector,  including generation, transmission,  and  distribution \nsystem  expansion  and  improvement.  Capacity  development  TA  attached  to  the  Tanahu \nHydropower Project was approved in 2013 and is being implemented to support NEA\u2019s financial \n                                                \n7  NEA incurred a net loss of NRs4.53 billion in 2013.  \n8  Financially separated in terms of assets and/or profits. \n9  The  Marsyangdi  Corridor  transmission  line  could  have  been  assigned  to  a  private  developer  that  is  considering \nbuilding  a  600  MW  hydropower  plant  in  Nepal.  Although  the  proposal  has  many  merits,  NEA  opted  for  a  purely \npublic facility. The rationale is to offer all private investors power evacuation facilities on a national and equal basis. \n10 The  feasibility  study  for  the  second  cross-border  transmission  line  is  being  funded  by  ADB.  2013.

The project \nwill supplement ADB\u2019s ongoing interventions by enhancing NEA\u2019s financial position through the \nimplementation  of  a  pricing  mechanism  for  the  use  of  NEA\u2019s  power  grid  by  third  parties  for \nelectricity exports, as well as improvements in NEA\u2019s planning capacity by supporting initiatives \nincluding the preparation of the distribution system and rural electrification master plan.  \n \n8. \nLessons from ongoing projects. Since 2009, ADB operations in Nepal\u2019s power sector \nhave  been  instrumental  in  supporting  the  reform  process,  including  preparation  of  NEA\u2019s \nfinancial restructuring and a tariff increase of 20% after 11 years. However, the implementation \nof  the  ongoing  projects,  including  the  procurement  of  consultants  and  contractors,  has  been \nslow. NEA\u2019s decision making has also been slow. Land acquisition has been a problem, mostly \nbecause  of  changes  in  the  alignment  of  transmission  lines.  Project  readiness  has  been  low. \nThese  lessons  have  been  integrated  into  the  design  of  this  project.  A  project  management \ndirectorate will manage the project. The directorate, headed by a deputy managing director level \nofficer,  will  be  responsible for  procurement  and  construction  supervision  of  all  ADB  projects.15 \nThe  project  preparatory  TA  includes  a  consulting  firm  to  help  NEA  with  the  detailed  design, \nroute surveys, preparation of bidding documents, and selection of turnkey contractors. A project \nsupervision consulting firm, funded by the project, will oversee construction. The implementation \nschedule  will  be  longer  than  the  standard  5  years.  The  S  curve  for  disbursement16 is  realistic \nand takes into account the difficulties encountered in project implementation in Nepal.  \n \n9. \nCoordination  with  other  development  partners.  The  project  has  been  developed  in \ncoordination  with  the  NEA;  the  Alternative  Energy  Promotion  Centre  (AEPC);  the  Ministry  of \nEnergy; the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment; the Government of Norway and \nthe Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; the European Investment Bank (EIB); the \nGovernment  of  Denmark;  and  the  German  Development  Bank.  The  project  components \ncomplement the operations of the World Bank Group and  the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency.17 \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  project's  impact  will  be  increased  electricity  access  in  Nepal  and  improved  power \nexchange across the border. The outcome will be increased capacity of the national power grid \nand enhanced renewable energy development.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \n \n\nThe project will have four outputs:  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\nOutput  1:  Power  transmission  capacity  increased.  This  comprises  (a) \nconstruction  and/or  augmentation  of  45.0  kilometers  (km)  of  400  kV  and  191.5 \nkm  of  220  kV  transmission  lines  along  the  Kali  Gandaki  corridor  and  the \nMarsyangdi\u2013Kathmandu  route;  (b)  construction  and/or  augmentation  of  500 \nmegavolt-ampere  (MVA)  of  400  kV/220  kV/132  kV,  500  MVA  of  220  kV/132 \n\n                                                \n15 Details are in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A display in curve of projected cumulative disbursement amount plotted against time of project implementation. \n17 The World Bank is supporting the Dhalkebar (Nepal)\u2013Muzarffarpur (India) 400 kV cross-border transmission line. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4  \n\n  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nkV/33 kV, and 120 MVA of 33 kV/11 kV grid substations along the Kali Gandaki \ncorridor  and  Marsyangdi\u2013Kathmandu  route;  and  (c)  construction  and/or \nreplacement of grid service substations with an aggregate capacity of 393.8 MVA \nacross the country.18\n \nimproved.  This  comprises  the \nOutput  2:  Power  distribution  network \nconstruction and/or upgrading of 410 km of 33 kV, 545 km of 11 kV, and 725 km \nof  400-volt  distribution  lines;  216  MVA  33kV/11kV  substations;  and  20  MVA \ndistribution substations in the east, central, and west regions.  \nOutput  3:  Mini-grid-based  renewable  energy  systems  in  off-grid  areas \nincreased. This includes installation of up to 4.3 MW of mini hydroelectric power \nplants  and  up  to  0.5  MW  of  mini-grid-based  solar  or  solar  and  wind  hybrid \nsystems in selected rural communities through the provision of (a) a credit line of \n$5  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  to  user  communities  for  mini-hydro  power \nplants, and (b) a $10 million grant from the SCF administered by ADB.19\n \nOutput  4:  Capacity  development  for  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  and \nAlternative Energy Promotion Centre provided. The physical investments will \nbe  reinforced  and  supplemented  by  capacity  building  for  NEA  and  AEPC, \nincluding  support  for  project  management;  preparation  of  a  distribution  system \nand rural electrification master plan, as well as a feasibility study of a large-scale \nwind farm; and parallel livelihood development activities in the project area. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe project is estimated to cost $440 million including physical and price contingencies \nand  interest  during  implementation.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  1.  Detailed \ncost estimates are in the project administration manual (PAM).20  \n \n13. \nThe government has requested a loan of $180.0 million in various currencies equivalent \nto SDR116.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project.21 The loan \nwill have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  ADB  will  finance  the  interest  during \nconstruction. \n \n14. \nThe  government  also  requested  cofinancing  of  $191.2  million,  comprising  a  loan  of \n$120.0  million  from  the  EIB, 22 a  grant  of  $60.0  million  equivalent  from  the  Government  of \nNorway,23 and  a grant  of $11.2 million from  the  ADB  SCF. The funds from  the  Government  of \nNorway and the ADB SCF will be administered by ADB.24 ADB and the Government of Norway \nwill  conclude  a  joint  contractual  cofinancing  agreement,  while  ADB  and  EIB  will  conclude  an \n\n                                                \n18 In addition, the EIB will provide parallel cofinancing for the construction of 125 km of a 220 kV transmission line and \n400 MVA of 220 kV/132 kV/33 kV substations along the Marsyangdi corridor, and 24 km of a 132 kV transmission \nline,  and  30  MVA  132  kV/33  kV  and  6/8  MVA  of  33  kV/11  kV  substations  for  Samundratar\u2013Trishuli  3B  Hub \ntransmission line. \n\n19 Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries financed by the SCF, Nepal has been \nselected  as  a  pilot  country  for  funding  and  TA.  The  government  prepared  the  Scaling  Up  Renewable  Energy \nProgram  Investment  Plan,  which  was  endorsed  by  the  governing  trust  fund  committee  of  the  SCF  in  November \n2011. Outputs 3 and 4 will be implemented as integral parts of the National Rural and Renewable Energy Program. \n\n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 This includes $70 million from the allocation for regional cooperation and integration projects. \n22 The EIB cofinancing is parallel and will not be administered by ADB. \n23 The Government of Norway will provide cofinancing in Norwegian kroner. \n24 ADB  and  ADB-administered  funds  will  finance  transportation  and  insurance  costs.

Procurement to be financed by ADB funds and ADB-administered \nfunds will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Since ADB is administering cofinancing resources in the form of grants from \nthe  Government  of  Norway  and  the  SCF  for  operations  financed  by  the  Asian  Development \nFund  (ADF),  universal  procurement  will  apply  to  all  procurement  packages  to  be  financed  by \nADF resources, jointly by ADF resources and the grant from Norway, and by the SCF grant.27 \n \n18. \nThe  government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  contracting  for  procurement  of \ngoods and turnkey works, and for recruitment of consultants. The government has been advised \nthat  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to finance  the  project.  The \ngovernment has requested ADB assistance in selecting the project supervision consultant. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n19. \nThe  project  will  be  supported  by  capacity  development  TA  for  Supporting  Rural \nElectrification  through  Renewable  Energy. 28  The  Ministry  of  Science,  Technology  and \nEnvironment will be the executing agency.

The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will examine \nthe  feasibility  of  a  large-scale  wind  farm  (minimum  aggregated  installed  capacity  of  1  MW)  in \nNepal, and prepare draft regulations for implementing the Renewable Energy Promotion Board \nAct. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20. \nTechnical due diligence has been undertaken on all components and confirmed that the \ncost estimates are reasonable and unit costs compare favorably with similar recent projects in \nIndia and Nepal. The proposed technologies and design concepts are similar to NEA\u2019s existing \ntechnologies and practices for transmission system design, construction, and operation, except \nthat NEA has no experience with high-temperature, low-sag conductors.29 AEPC staff is familiar \nwith  the  technologies  and  concepts  for  all  the  subprojects  of  the  off-grid  component.  The \ncapacity development component will provide technical support to NEA and AEPC for designing \nand commissioning the subprojects. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nFinancial  analysis  of  the  project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \n21. \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 30  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in \nconstant  2014  prices.  The  NEA\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  estimated  at  1.2%  (in \npre-tax real terms). Based on conservative assumptions adopted for base case analysis, a one-\noff  real  tariff  increase  of  20%  and  continuing  annual  real  increases  of  1.4%  are  required  to \nensure the financial viability of the project in aggregate with a financial internal rate of return of \n1.4%.31 The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  will  rise  to  3.2%  if  wheeling  power  from  the  Upper \nMarsyangdi 2 hydropower station to India through transmission facilities is considered.32  \n\n \n\n22. \nThe  project  has  been  analyzed  for  economic  viability  using  a  with-  and  without-project \napproach  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.33 The \neconomic internal rate of return of the project is 22%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project \nreturns are robust against changes to critical variables with a minimum economic internal rate of \nreturn of 16%.34 The on-grid components will support new clean energy supplies of at least 200 \nMW  for  domestic  use\u2014sufficient  for  the  minimum  needs  of  at  least  2  million  people\u2014and \nfacilitate  exchange  of  at  least  1,200  MW  with  India.  The  off-grid  component  will  help  30,500 \nhouseholds to access electricity in off-grid areas. Mainly because of the displacement of fossil \nfuel and kerosene-based lighting system in off-grid areas, about 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide \nwill be reduced annually.  \n \n\n                                                \n29 Technical  Notes  on  High-Temperature,  Low-Sag  Conductors  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n30 ADB. 2005.

The  NEA  has  sufficient  experience  in  local  and  foreign  procurement,  including \nADB  standard  bidding  procedures  under  domestic  projects  and  external  assistance  from \ninternational  development  partners.  AEPC  has  experience  in  local  and  foreign  procurement \nunder  domestic  projects  and  external  assistance  from  international  development  partners.  As \nthis will be AEPC\u2019s first direct experience with ADB funding, a long-term procurement consultant \nwill  be  engaged  to  provide  support.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  NEA,  and  AEPC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  project  interventions  are  designed  to  benefit  the  poor  through increased  economic \n24. \nopportunity, knowledge, and rights. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \nA  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  plan  has  been  prepared.35 Enhanced  electricity  access \nwill  help  reduce  poverty  including  women\u2019s  time  poverty.  The  executing  agencies  and \ncontractors  will  ensure  that  priority  and  preference  are  given  to  local  workers,  especially  the \npoor,  the  disadvantaged,  and  marginalized  ethnic  groups.  The  project  will  promote  and \nadvocate  for  a  socially  inclusive,  gender-equitable,  and  non-discriminatory  work  environment \nand practices. Practices will be consistent with core labor standards. Where worker migration is \nrequired,  the  project  will  minimize  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  through  information  dissemination \ncampaigns at project areas. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examinations  and  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  for  future  unidentified  off-grid  subprojects  have  been \nprepared  for  both  on-  and  off-grid  components  following  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009)  and  the  government's  environmental  regulatory  framework. 36  Potential  impacts  are \nmostly temporary and reversible, but some irreversible impacts on the natural habitat will occur \nbecause of the  clearance of  about  150  hectares  of forested  land.  Available information  on the \nhabitat  ranges  and  elevations  of  sensitive  species  indicates  that  critical  habitat  will  not  be \ndirectly impacted; potential impacts on natural habitat and potentially sensitive ecosystems have \nbeen  identified  and  can  be  readily  mitigated.  Due  diligence  has  determined  that  associated \nhydropower  facilities  comply  with  Nepal\u2019s  regulatory  requirements.  Cumulative  and  induced \nimpacts will have net positive benefits from easier access to energy and productive end uses of \nenergy. Climate change risk screening was conducted and resulted to a medium climate change \nclassification. Risks identified will be addressed through best practice engineering design.37  \n \n26. \nThe  initial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs) \nfor  all  components  include mitigation  measures,  monitoring,  and budgetary  provisions  that  are \nadequate to address the environmental impacts of the project. The EMPs\u2019 requirements will be \nincorporated into bidding documents. The NEA and AEPC have sufficient capacity to supervise \nconstruction contracts and EMP implementation, including preparation of semiannual monitoring \nreports. The EMPs will be updated as necessary during implementation. Public consultation and \ninformation disclosure requirements have been met, including requirements for consultation with \n\n                                                \n35 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Initial Environmental Examination; Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n37 Project  Climate  Risk  Assessment  and  Management  Report  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2) \n\n \n\n\fthe management teams for protected areas. The environmental assessment for the project was \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 28 February 2014.  \n \n27. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The \nproject  will  require  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement,  which  will  primarily  be \neconomic displacements with limited impact from physical displacement. The transmission and \ndistribution  components  will  have  permanent  and  temporary  impacts.  Permanent  impacts  are \nanticipated  from  land  acquisition  for  the  construction  of  new  transmission  substations, \ndistribution substations, transmission towers, and distribution poles.  The temporary impacts will \nbe  from  the  loss  of  trees  and  crops  along  the  right-of-way.  About  715  households  will  be \naffected  by  land acquisition  and loss of  crops  and trees.  An initial  assessment  shows  that the \nproject  areas  do  not  have  any  endangered  indigenous  peoples  groups.  The  magnitude  of  the \nimpacts on indigenous peoples is not significant. Impacts are limited to loss of portions of land \nfor  some  indigenous  peoples  which  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost.  Where  these \ngroups  are  considered  vulnerable,  additional  resettlement  assistance  will  be  provided,  in \naddition to the compensation, and consultations will be carried out to make them aware  of the \nproject and to obtain their endorsement for land acquisition.  \n \n28. \nBased on surveys, two draft combined resettlement and indigenous peoples plans have \nbeen prepared for the on-grid components, in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nthe  government\u2019s  legal  framework. 38  These  plans  will  be  publicly  disclosed  to  interested \nstakeholders on the ADB and NEA websites.  \n \n29. \nThe  off-grid  component  will  not  have  any  resettlement  impacts  for  sample  subprojects \nand  no  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.39 The  minimum  private  land  requirements  for \nthe sample subprojects will be met through voluntary land donation. A due diligence report has \nbeen prepared for the sample subprojects. The off-grid component allows for future subprojects, \nwhich  have  not  been  identified  and  are  subject  to  due  diligence.  Therefore,  a  resettlement \nframework40 and an indigenous peoples planning framework41 have been prepared as required \nby  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  related  national  policies  and  legislation.  AEPC  will \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  and  indigenous  people  plan,  and  will  submit \nsemiannual reports to ADB.  \n \n30. \nSocial  safeguards  measures  will  be  achieved  in  line  with  the  provisions  stated  in  the \nPAM.42 A  summary  of  the  initial  social  safeguards  assessment  is  presented  in  the  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy.43 \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 44 The  project  benefits  are  expected  to \noutweigh the associated risks. \n\n                                                \n38 Combined  Resettlement  Plan  and  Indigenous  Peoples  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n39 No impacts on indigenous peoples groups are foreseen for the off-grid component. If impacts are identified, AEPC \nwill prepare an indigenous peoples plan, identifying fair and inclusive compensation and rehabilitation measures, in \nline with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national laws and regulations. \n\n40 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n41 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n42 Sections VII (safeguards) and VIII (gender and social) of the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2).  \n\n43 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10  \n\n  \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak regulatory framework \n\nFinancial sustainability of NEA \n\nSlow  decision  making  within  NEA \non project implementation \nWeak implementation capacity of \nAEPC in larger-scale mini-hydro \nprojects \nTariff collected from end users may \nnot cover O&M cost because of low \ntariffs and low load factor \n\nMitigating Measures \nContinued  policy  dialogue  with  government  to  enact  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission legislation  \nADB is supporting the implementation of NEA financial restructuring plan and \nmanagement  reforms,  and  strengthening  ETFC\u2019s  capacity  to  review  retail \ntariff  adjustment  petitions.  The  project  will  support  NEA  in  establishing  a \npricing mechanism for open access to its power grid for electricity exports.  \nA  dedicated  PMD  will  be  responsible  for  preparation  and  implementation  of \nthe project, with assistance from project implementation support consultants. \nA two-tier implementation structure will be adopted. The implementation \nsupport consultants will assist AEPC at the central level, while RSCs and \nsocial mobilizers will support AEPC at the field level.   \nThe project design has integrated into project implementation the support for \nproductive energy use activities to ensure these activities are ready for \noperation once the power generation parts are commissioned.
