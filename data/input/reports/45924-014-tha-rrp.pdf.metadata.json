With its recent acquisitions and projects currently under development, EGCO plans \nto increase its installed renewable energy capacity to over 300 MW by 2015.3 EGCO\u2019s strategy \naligns with the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2012\u20132021 approved by \nthe  Government  of  Thailand  in  December  2011,  which  increased  the  target  for  wind  power \ncapacity to 1,200 MW by 2021.4 As of January 2012, only 7.28 MW of wind power was installed \nand  operating  in  the  country.  The  plan  sets  out  a  target  of  generating  25%  of  primary  energy \nfrom  renewable  sources  by  2021,    thereby  avoiding  76  million  tons  of  carbon  emissions \nannually. This will be the first Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing of a wind power project \nin  Southeast  Asia.  It  is  working  with  EGCO  on  this  project  to  establish  a  financing  framework \nthat can be replicated for EGCO\u2019s larger 200 MW wind power project planned in 2013.  \n \nThe project is eligible for cofinancing from the  ADB CTF.5 The Clean Technology Fund \n3. \nprovides  concessional  financing  to  support  the  rapid  deployment  of  low-carbon  technologies \nwith significant potential to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. It is \nadministered through multilateral development banks, including ADB, and is one of the largest \nfunds helping developing countries fill gaps in financing projects to mitigate climate change. The \nCTF  Trust  Fund  Committee  approved  the  allocation  of  $99.5  million  for  the  CTF  Thailand \nPrivate Sector Renewable Energy Program on 24 May 2012, to be utilized and administered by \nADB.6 The  proposed  project  is  the  second  private  sector  project  in  Thailand7 under  the  ADB \nCTF8 (approved and under due diligence), for a total allocation of $19 million to date. \n \n4. \nAs  of  June  2012,  Thailand\u2019s  installed  power  generation  capacity  was  31,525  MW.  The \ncountry\u2019s electricity production depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 65% produced using \n\n                                                \n1   Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   EGCO\u2019s currently operating installed capacity for renewable energy includes 9.9 MW generated from biomass and \n\n63 MW of solar.   \n\n4   The original target for wind power was set at 800 MW in 2007.  \n5   Climate Investment Funds. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n6   ADB  Thailand  Private  Sector  Renewable  Energy  Program  approved  by  CTF  Trust  Fund  Committee  on  24  May \n2012 pursuant  to  the  Financial  Procedures  Agreement  entered  into between  ADB  and  the  International  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  as  trustee  of  the  Trust  Fund  for  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  dated  18  March \n2010. \n\n7   The first private sector project identified under the ADB CTF is the Provincial Solar Power Project.   \n8   ADB. 2009.

Natural  gas  has  traditionally  provided  Thailand  with  a \nreliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling natural gas reserves \nfrom the Gulf  of Thailand  mean  the  country must  diversify  and  secure  alternative  fuel  sources \nfor power generation. Fortunately, Thailand has abundant renewable energy sources\u2014biomass, \nbiogas,  mini-hydro,  solar,  and  wind.  Using  these  domestic  sources  of  renewable  energy  can \nboost  Thailand\u2019s  energy  security,  save  foreign  exchange,  and  protect  the  country  from  global \nprice fluctuations.  \n\n \nTo  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  advocates \n5. \ndecentralized power generation mainly by supporting the country\u2019s small power producer (SPP) \nand very small power producer (VSPP) programs. The SPP program allows private developers \nto  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390  MW  power  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase \nagreements  (PPAs)  with  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT).  Under  the \nVSPP  program,  producers  of  up  to  10  MW  may  sell  power  to  the  Metropolitan  Electricity \nAuthority  (MEA)  or  the  Provincial  Electricity  Authority  (PEA).  Renewable  energy  SPPs  and \nVSPPs are eligible for a feed-in tariff (or \u2015adder\u2016) in addition to the wholesale electricity price. As \nof  March  2012,  only  three  wind  power  VSPPs  were  connected  to  the  grid,  with  a  combined \ncapacity of 0.380 MW.   \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n6. \nThe  borrower  is  Theppana  Wind  Farm  Company,  a  special  purpose  project  company \n90%  owned  by  EGCO  and  10%  owned  by  the  founder  of  Pro  Ventum,  an  international  wind \npower developer based in Germany.9  \n \n7. \nEGCO  is Thailand\u2019s first  independent  power  producer  and  currently  the second  largest \nprivate power producer in the country. It was privatized by EGAT in 1992 and listed on the Stock \nExchange  of  Thailand  in  1995.

It  is  expected  that  successful  project  implementation  and \nviable returns will attract other private investors to wind energy projects. \n \n\nThe  outcome  will  be  the  demonstrated  viability  and  sustainability  of  a  utility-scale  wind \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n11. \nproject in the private sector.. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \n \nC. \n\nThe output will be the installation and operation of the 7.5 MW wind power plant. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  supports  development  that  is  environmentally  sustainable  and \n13. \nrecognizes  the  role  of  the  private  sector  to  meet  growing  energy  demand  in  the  region, \ncapitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  operating  strengths  in  infrastructure  development,  finance,  and  other \nareas. 13  The  strategy  supports  expanding  environment-friendly  technologies  for  clean  and \nefficient  energy generation  and use,  as  well  as  a larger  role for  the  private  sector  financing of \ninfrastructure through public\u2013private partnership. The project is consistent with the above.  \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n14. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2007\u20132011  for  Thailand  has  three  core  strategic \nareas:  infrastructure,  environmental  sustainability,  and  capital  markets. 14  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  this  strategy.  The  government\u2019s  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2012\u2013\n2021  notes  the  immense  potential  of  wind  power  in  Thailand  and  that  energy  imports  can  be \navoided  through  its  use  with  private  investment.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  long-\n\n                                                \n12 The  government  has  established  clean  energy  targets of  1,200  MW  of  wind power  by  2021  and  25%  of primary \n\ncommercial energy from renewable sources by 2021. \n\n13 ADB.  2008.

In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), an initial environmental examination was carried out. The project site and its \nimmediate vicinity do not support natural vegetation of ecological significance. The site does not \nprovide  important  habitat  to  any  terrestrial  birds,  nor  is  located  along  the  route  of  migratory \nbirds.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  identified,  and \neffective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  mitigate  them  are  outlined  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  Impacts  during  construction  are  short  term  and  will  be  readily  mitigated. \nDuring  operation,  predicted  noise  and  shadow  flicker  effects  will  be  studied,  confirmed,  and \nmonitored.  Theppana  is  committed  to  hiring  qualified  staff  to  implement  the  plan  including  the \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nconduct  of  regular  O&M  in  partnership  with  Goldwind.25 The  cost  of  mitigation  measures  is \nincluded  in  project  design  and  overall  project  cost.  The  monitoring  program  will  keep  track  of \nnoise,  shadow  flicker  frequency,  bird  and  bat  injury  or  mortality,  complaints  received,  and \nincidents or accidents. Theppana will submit an annual environmental monitoring report to ADB.    \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. \nTheppana  entered  into  lease  agreements  for  land  under  the  Agricultural  Land  Reform  Office, \nwhere  the  wind  turbines,  substation,  and  green  area  will  be  located,  and  for  Nor  Sor  3  Gor26 \nland  that  will  be  used  for  the  access  road.  The  lease  agreement  with  the  Agricultural  Land \nReform  Office  includes  consent  signed  by  farmers  who  will  yield  portions  of  the  land  they \nfarmed.  These  agreements  were  based  on  negotiation  and  the  agreed  compensation \npackage.27 No  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the  transmission  line,  as  Theppana  will  upgrade \nPEA\u2019s existing transmission line. There are no indigenous peoples at the project site. \n\n \n19. \nDuring  construction,  250  workers  will  be  engaged,  mainly  as  skilled  and  unskilled \nlaborers.  Theppana  and  its  contractors  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  and \nreport  annually  to  ADB  on  their  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards.28 Stakeholders,  including  communities  in  the  vicinity  of  the \nproject, were informed and consulted about the project.
