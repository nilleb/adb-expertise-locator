Over \nthe  last  5  years,  the  Government  and  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH) \nhave  made  great  progress  in  replacing  the  inefficient  hospital-\nbased  system,  which  is  biased  toward  curative  care,  with  a \nsystem  based  on  primary  health  care  (PHC)  and  preventive \nservices.  In  particular,  the  concept  of  family  medicine  has  been \nintroduced  and  a  network  of  family  group  practices  (FGPs) \nestablished.  However,  much  remains  to  be  done  to  embed  the \nchanges  and  deepen  their  impact;  further  efforts  to  improve  the \nquality of FGPs and rationalize hospital facilities and  overstaffing \nare essential.  \n\n \n\nADB  will  continue  its  partnership  with  the  Government  in  helping \n(i)  improve  rural  health  service  delivery,  especially  to  achieve \nMillennium  Development  Goals  at  all  levels  of  the  rural  health \nsystem ;  (ii)  introduce  changes  in  traditional  popular  views  of \nhealth  services;  (iii)  strengthen  the  reform  process  and  MOH \ncapacity to implement reforms; and (iv) study and test initiatives of \npublic sector management and health care financing mechanisms \nto improve sector efficiency, sustainability, and pro-poor focus. \n \nThe  goal  of  the  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project \n(HSDP2)  is  to  improve  the  health  of  the  people,  especially  the \npoor  and  vulnerable,  including  women  and  children,  in  targeted \nrural areas. HSDP2 has two objectives: (i) improve the quality and \nutilization of health services in rural areas, especially for the poor \nand  vulnerable;  and (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  the  health  sector, \nextending  the  reforms  in  sector  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and \nsustainability, and institutional development initiated by the HSDP.  \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nHSDP2 has three components: (i) integrated improvement of rural \nhealth  services,  (ii)  institutional  capacity  development,  and  (iii) \nproject  management.  Component  (i)  will  be  implemented in  five \nrural  aimags  (Bayanhongor,  Dornod,  Dzavhan,  Ovorhangay,  and \nHentiy), which were selected for their level and severity of poverty, \nlevels of infant and maternal mortality, and incidence of infectious \ndiseases.  Components  (ii)  and  (iii)  are  nationwide.  HSDP2  will \nfocus investment in areas that will have the greatest impact on the \npoor and vulnerable.    \n \nThe total project cost is $17.50 million equivalent, of which $9.26 \nmillion equivalent is the foreign exchange cost, and $8.24 million \nequivalent, the local currency cost.   \n \n\n \nSource \nA.

The  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.  Interest \nwill  be  charged  at  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% thereafter.  The borrower will be Mongolia.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  SDR10.191  million  ($14  million \nequivalent).  The  balance  of  $3.5  million  equivalent  will  be \nprovided by the Government. The ADB loan will include financing \nof the interest charge. \n \n5 years  \n \n30 June 2008 \n\n \nAllocation  and  Lending \nTerms \n\n \nA  project implementation unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  in  MOH, \nbased  on  the  framework  of  the  existing  HSDP  PIU  to  ensure \ncontinuity  of  experienced  staff.  In  each  HSDP2  aimag, an aimag \nproject coordinator will be assigned. A national steering committee \nand aimag supervisory groups will be formed for policy guidance \nand coordination. \n \nMinistry of Health \n \nProcurement  of  ADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil \nworks will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement, and Mongolia\u2019s Public Procurement Law, which was \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\f \n\n   v\n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nProcurement, and Mongolia\u2019s Public Procurement Law, which was \nprepared  with  ADB  assistance.

International  consulting  firms  or  individuals \nwill be engaged.  \n \nA  grant  of  $650,000  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives  in \npublic sector management and health care financing mechanisms. \nThe  objectives  of  the  technical  assistance  are  to  (i)  strengthen \nMOH  and  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  capacity  and \nimprove  understanding  of  output-based  budgeting  for  the  new \nPublic  Sector  Finance  Management  Law,  and  (ii)  improve \neffectiveness and sustainability of the Health Insurance Fund.   \n \nHSDP2  will  benefit  the  whole  population  indirectly  through \nnationwide  components  that  support  health  sector  reform  and \nsector institutional building.  \n \nUnder the targeted rural health service component, about 400,000 \npeople  in  five  rural  aimags,  representing  18%  of  the  total \npopulation,  will  benefit  directly  from  improved  availability  and \nquality  of  rural  health  services.  About  48.5%  of  the  population in \nthese  HSDP2  aimags  is  poor,  compared  to  the  national  average \nof 36.0%. The targeted aimags also have endemic diseases and a \nhigh infant mortality rate, which are composite proxies for poverty \nincidence, indicating that most people in the targeted aimags face \nmultiple deprivations.   \n \nIn the five  targeted  aimags,  HSDP2 will  strengthen public health \neducation  and  preventive  works  at  the  bag  (community)  level, \nrenovate  and  equip  soum  (district)  health  centers  and  aimag \nhospitals, train  staff at all levels of  the health  system  to improve \nthe  quality  of  service  delivery,  and  set  up  performance-based \nincentives  in  provider payments to improve service management  \nand    increase    attention    to  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including \nwomen  and  children.  HSDP2  will  encourage  greater  participation \nof stakeholders. \n \nHSDP2  will  focus  its  support  on  PHC,  which  is  an  internationally \nproven  best  practice  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable, especially women and children. Rural PHC is provided \nby bag  feldshers  (community  nurses),  soum  heath  centers, and \naimag  hospitals  for  referral  cases.  HSDP2  will  reinforce  bag \n\n\f \nRisks and Safeguards \n\naimag  hospitals  for  referral  cases.  HSDP2  will  reinforce  bag \nfeldshers who are primarily responsible for promoting reproductive \nhealth  and  soum  health  centers, where the most outpatients are \nwomen of reproductive age, and children. Aimag hospitals will be \nstrengthened  to  provide  quality  services  to  referral  cases  of \npregnant women, and children.  \n \nWomen  are  crucial in  providing  PHC  in  urban  and  rural  areas. \nMore  than  98%  of  rural  PHC  providers  (doctors,  nurses,  and \nfeldshers) are women. In urban areas women  also provide PHC. \nBy  focusing  on  PHC,  HSDP2  will  directly  benefit  women  through \nimproved human development services and empowerment.    \n \nHSDP2 is classified as a core poverty intervention with a focus on \nhuman development and gender and development.      \n \nThe  Government  is  active  in  introducing  reforms  and changes in \npublic  sector  management  and  health  care  financing  systems. \nHowever,  if  initiatives  are  not  accompanied  by  a  change  in \ncapacity and capability of stakeholders of the health sector and an \nefficient  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  expected  outcomes \nare not likely. This risk will be minimized in HSDP2 through strong \ncapacity-building  support,  provision  of  technical  services,  and \nstrengthened monitoring systems.  \n \nThe changes being introduced in health service delivery require a \nchange in attitude of staff and clients and in management. HSDP2 \nwill invest in a public information campaign to manage perceptions \nof a responsive health system and will strengthen management.  \n \nInsufficient funds will hamper PHC reform.  Hospital rationalization \nshould  be  accelerated  to  reallocate  funds  to  reform  PHC  and \nFGP.  HSDP2  will  support  hospital rationalization  by  intensifying \npolicy dialogue, improving efficiency in hospital management, and \nbuilding MOH capacity to plan and monitor hospital restructuring.      \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\ni\ni\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Mongolia  for  the  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project  (HSDP2).  1   The  report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical assistance  (TA)  for  support  for  health  reform,  and  if  the  Board \napproves the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the Board, will \napprove the TA.   \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE:  SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nInitial Reform Achievements \n\n \nA. \n \nMongolia has been reforming  its  health  care  system  and  health  financing  mechanisms \n2. \nsince the early 1990s. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) through Health Sector Development \nProgram (HSDP)2 has been  helping the Government plan and implement sector reforms since \n1997 and has introduced significant and necessary changes in the health system. The aim is to \nreplace  an  old  Soviet  model,  dominated  by  an  extensive  network  of  hospitals  that  were \noverstaffed,  emphasized  facility-based  curative  care, and not sustainable  after  transition, with \none that is more responsive to client needs, based on primary health care (PHC) and preventive \nservices, of good quality, and sustainable.  \n \n3. \nOne of the major accomplishments under the HSDP was the introduction of family group \npractices (FGPs) to provide PHC. FGPs\u2014teams of doctors and nurses\u2014work as private entities \nthrough  contracts  with  local  administrations.  The  Government  established  237  FGPs  in \nUlaanbaatar  and  in  all  aimag  centers  nationwide  by  early  2002.  FGPs  receive  capitation \npayment  under  performance-based  contracts  that  incorporate  incentives  for  FGPs  to  see  the \npoor. The FGP system serves the poor and vulnerable better than other types of services3.  \n \nOther reforms included the introduction of licensing and accreditation. While licensing of \n4. \nFGPs  has  been  established  and  applied  nationwide,  hospital  accreditation  has  been  applied \nonly to a limited extent, reflecting weak reform in the hospital sector. Rationalization of hospitals \nand health personnel has reduced the number of beds and staff by 40% since 1990 (to 7.5 beds \nand 13.4 staff per 1,000 population in 2001). However, these ratios are still much higher than in \ncomparable countries, and rationalization should be pursued. A review of the progress of HSDP \nimplementation is in Appendix 2.   \n \nB. \n \n5. \naddressed to expand and sustain development progress in health:   \n \n6. \nDouble Burden of  Diseases. People\u2019s health has improved steadily since 1996 but is \nstill poor. The infant mortality rate (IMR) has declined but is still high at 30.2 per 1,000 live births \nin 20014 and is worse in rural than  urban areas. The main causes of death among infants and \n\nThe  health  sector  faces  considerable  challenges.  The  following  key  issues  must  be \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities  \n\n                                                 \n1   The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 1997.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \nMongolia  for  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila.  This  includes  a  program loan to support policy \nreforms, a project loan for investments, and a TA for support for decentralized health services. \n\n3   An e valuation report on the FGP system is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n4  Household  surveys  report  higher  mortality  than  does  MOH.  MOH  data  is  suspected  to  miss  several  births, \n\nparticularly neonatal deaths. \n\n\fchildren  under  5  years  of  age  are  respiratory  diseases,  perinatal  conditions,  diarrhea,  and \ninfectious  diseases.  Poor  nutrition  among  children  increases  vulnerability  to  disease.  The \ndownward trend in the maternal mortality rate (MMR) has reversed  recently and is of particular \nconcern.  MMR  in  rural  areas  is  twice  that  in  urban  areas.  Poor  nutrition,  particularly among \npregnant women, is another acute problem.  Table 1 provides relevant Millennium Development \nGoals (MDG) indicators and the goals that the country aims to achieve.   \n \n7. \nMongolia  has  rapidly  undergone  an  epidemiological  transition  in the  past  ten  years. \nDisease pattern shows the  double burden of communicable  and  noncommunicable  diseases. \nThe  country  faces  reemerging  infectious  diseases. Tuberculosis,  syphilis,  and  viral  hepatitis \nincreased significantly over the last  5  years.  So  far,  4  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)-\npositive  cases  have  been  identified,  but  sexually  transmitted  infections  and  risk  behavior  are \nwidespread,  contributing  to  HIV  vulnerability.  In  brief,  the  health  system  faces  challenges  in \naddressing  communicable  and  maternal  and  child  health  conditions  and  noncommunicable \ndiseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, accidents, and injuries.  \n \n\nTable 1.

The health system in rural areas is composed \n8. \nof bag feldshers (community nurses), soum health centers, and aimag hospitals. Bag feldshers \nand  soum  health  centers  provide  PHC for  rural  populations,  including  health  education,  and \nbasic  health  services,  including  maternal  services.  Aimag  hospitals  (250\u2013350  beds)  provide \nfirst-referral services. For remote areas, inter-soum hospitals are set up as first-referral hospitals. \nAlthough  providing PHC  to  outpatients,  soum  health  centers  are  equipped  with  beds  mainly \nbecause of the centers' vast catchment areas and severe climate conditions.  \n \n9. \nUnequal  access  to  quality  health  services, and  the worse  health  status  in  rural  than \nurban areas are serious constraints in the health sector. Health resources are  concentrated in \nurban  areas,  particularly  in  Ulaanbaatar,  while  rural  areas  have  a  shortage  of  physicians  and \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nHospital-Dominated  System  and \n\nother  qualified  health  workers,  deteriorated  buildings,  and  a  lack  of  basic  equipment  and \nsupplies.  Reflecting  the  low  population  density  and  low  service  quality,  soum  health  centers \nserve only  2\u20135  outpatients  a  day  and  5-10  deliveries  a  year.  Mortality  rates  are  consistently \nhigher  in  rural  than  urban  areas,  indicating  that  rural  Mongolians  have  not  benefited  equally \nfrom health service improvement.  \n \n10. \nHuman  resources  are  scarce  in  rural  areas.  Isolation,  lack  of  opportunity  for  medical \nconsultation  with  colleagues,  limited  practice  due  to  the  small  population,  lack  of  up-to-date \ntechnical  material,  limited  opportunity  for  on-the-job  training  and  continuing  education  with \nappropriate  supervision,  and  difficult  transportation  and  communication  conditions  are  major \nobstacles to attracting and retaining qualified health staff in rural areas. Recently, the Ministry of \nHealth  (MOH)  prepared a strategy  to  strengthen  soum  health  centers,  proposing to renovate \nand equip health centers, train and retain soum health workers, and pilot capitation  payment at \nthe  soum  level.  HSDP2  will  assist  this  MOH  initiative  and  provide  an  integrated  set  of \nimprovements.   \n \nInefficient  Hospital  Management.  Hospital \n11. \nrationalization is still a major challenge. HSDP set an initial target of 7.5 hospital beds per 1,000 \npopulation, which was met in 1999, but is still high for Mongolia\u2019s economic level.  Much of the \nhealth  budget  is spent keeping  hospitals  open and  heated, depleting funds to finance care  of \npatients. If hospitals are not further rationalized, investment impact will be diluted.   \n \n12. \nRationalization  should  make  hospital  management  more  efficient.  Hospital  care  is \ncharacterized  by  long  stays  (10.72  days)  and  relatively  high  admission  rates  (20.4%  of  the \npopulation are hospitalized annually), leading to high bed occupancy. Long stays are driven by \nperverse  funding  arrangements,  low  quality  of  services  caused  by  shortage  of  drugs  and \noutdated treatment protocols, and facility-based protocols for infectious disease control, such as \nfor  tuberculosis.  Many  admissions  are  for  pathologies  that  would  be  treated  on  an  outpatient \nbasis in international practice, such as headache, hypertension, and diabetes.  Improvement in \nefficiency  of  hospital  management,  including  introduction  of  appropriate  admission  criteria, \ninternational  standard  treatment  guidelines,  and output based provider  payment mechanisms, \nwill reduce the required level of accommodation. The quality of PHC should be improved, and \ndemand for it increased to reduce the need and demand for hospitals. \n \n13. \nHowever, resistance  is strong  to  reducing the number of beds and  hospitals,  not  only \namong  health  personnel  and  MOH  but  also  among  the people,  who  are  accustomed  to  the \nhospital-based  system.  MOH\u2019s  previous  plans  to  close  or  merge  hospitals  have  been \nsuspended due to protests from the  people. External  assistance has not been coordinated to \nfacilitate rationalization. New hospitals are being built and the number of hospital beds has been \nincreasing  in  Ulaanbaatar  since  2000.  Policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  needs  to  be \nrenewed to pursue rationalization.   \n \n14. \nPoor Human Resources Development. The large-scale changes that have taken place \nin  clinical  and  managerial  arrangements  over  the  past  decade  have  created  many  new \nchallenges for staff at all levels of the health system. Overstaffing and staff maldistribution have \ncontinued  to  hamper  sector  efficiency.  The  number  of  physicians  has  increased  since  1999, \nparticularly  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  current  high  demand  for  physician  training,  and  a  lack  of \ncongruency between service needs and training intakes, has led to significant overproduction of \nphysicians. Medical university students should be reduced, and incentives given to  physicians \nand nurses to stay in rural and remote areas.  \n \n\n\fDecentralization  has  become  a  government  priority.  Provincial  governments  became \n15. \nresponsible  for  delivering  and  financing  health  services,  while  MOH  has  shifted  to  policy \ndevelopment, strategic planning, regulation and standard setting, and monitoring and evaluation. \nHowever, local governments lack experience, and planning and managerial capacity in resource \nallocation in the health sector. Some have diverted resources from health care to other sectors. \nFew have been able to  follow  MOH\u2019s broad policy of shifting resources from hospitals to PHC. \nDespite  MOH\u2019s  overall  responsibility  for  workforce  planning,  and  the  recently  developed \nNational  Health  Workforce  Plan  2002-2012,  local  governments  continue  to  recruit,  distribute, \nand train staff within the budget framework set by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) \nin ways that may not always match MOH\u2019s plan.  If  decentralization is to produce the expected \npositive outcomes, capacity of local governments must be built.     \n \nSince  2002,  the  environment  has  become  conducive  to  linking  policy  setting  with \n16. \nimplementation  as  the Government  has decided to  delegate  decision  making  in  health budget \nallocation  to  MOH.  However,  data  on  health  services,  personnel, and budget  are  fragmented, \nand  hardly  linked  with  evidence-based  decision  making.  Capacity  building  of  MOH  and  local \ngovernments, combined with renewal of the health management information system (HMIS) and \noperational research, will have substantial positive impacts on sector efficiency.  \n \nLimited  and  Inefficient  Health  Care  Financing. 5  Health  care  spending  is  low  by \n17. \ninternational standards at 4.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). Thus, the Government must \nensure  that  its  financial  allocations  are  fair  and  efficient,  and  that  spending  is  prioritized \naccording  to  health  needs.  However,  financial  management  knowledge  and  skills  are \ninsufficient; and financing sources and fund flows and use are not understood enough to help \nauthorities to make efficient and effective decisions. In 2003, the World Bank will  help establish \nnational health accounts to help the Government analyze health expenditures. \n \n18.  Mongolia  is  undergoing  major  public  sector  reform.  The  Public  Sector  Finance \nManagement  Law  (PSFML)  was  passed  by  Parliament  in  2002, and will be  effective  in  2003. \nFinancial management capacity remains weak, and MOH lacks a  comprehensive health sector \nfinance  policy and  an  implementation  plan.  Aimags  lack  the  capacity  to  develop  an  efficient \nbudget  based  on  outputs.  Training  for  health  care  finance  at  the  central  and  aimag  levels  is, \ntherefore, required.  \n \n19.  Mongolia  has  supported  the  development of the social health insurance scheme since \n1994.  The  health  insurance  system  provided  universal  compulsory  coverage,  and  collected \nemployer-employee contributions.  The Government subsidized premiums for those categorized \nas \u201cvulnerable.\u201d  With  the  introduction  of  the  new  eligibility  criteria  in  2001, several people lost \nthese  benefits,  as  compulsory  was  replaced  by  voluntary  coverage.  Further  assessments \nrelated  to  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  in  2001  suggested  that  households  were \nunable  to  pay  premiums  due  to  liquidity  constraints  or  lack  of  geographical  access,  such  as \namong the nomadic population, and herdsman. \n \n20. \nThe sources of health care financing in 2001 included government budget (74%), Health \nInsurance  Fund  (HIF)  (23%),  and  cost  sharing  (3%). According to  PSFML, HIF is expected to \ncontribute  up  to  32%  of  the  total  health  budget  by  2003.  The  Government  expects  HIF  to \nimprove  its  income  from  premium s,  as  fewer people  are  now  categorized  under  \u201cvoluntary\u201d \ncoverage  and  eligible  for  exemptions  on  premiums.  However,  recent  premium  collection \nindicates that HIF revenue may not improve quickly and that the  Government may thus remain \n\n                                                 \n5  A detailed analysis of heath care financing and public health expenditure is in Supplementary Appendix B.   \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nthe  leading  financier  of  health  care.  HIF  has  no  regulations  and  criteria  for  service  use  and \nservice delivery quality control mechanisms. HIF must improve premium collection, set controls, \nestablish checks and balances, and streamline pricing mechanisms.   \n \nPeople\u2019s  Perceptions  and  Attitudes  to  Health  Reform.6 HSDP  identified  people\u2019s \n21. \ntraditional perceptions of and attitudes to health services\u2014valuing hospital-based curative care, \nfor  instance\u2014as  a  major  risk.  HSDP  aimed  to  reform  the  system  to emphasize  PHC. HSDP \nstrategies included information and education campaigns as well as quality assurance of FGPs, \nwhich  provide  PHC  to  the  urban  population.  Increased  utilization  of  FGPs  and  patient \nsatisfaction  with  them  were  observed.  However,  many  people,  particularly  in  Ulaanbaatar, \ncontinue  to  visit  hospitals,  bypassing  FGPs:  50%  of  hospital  outpatients  have  gone  directly  to \nhospitals.  \n \n22. \nThe information and education campaign supported by HSDP was found to be effective \nin promoting reform and emphasizing the role of FGPs. The campaign was particularly effective \nin  the  early  stages  but  gradually  tapered  off  as  budgets  were  reduced.  Information \ndissemination  was  largely  undertaken  by  project  staff  as  MOH  and  local  government \ninvolvement  was  not  optimal.  Information  and  education  are  important  components  of  the \noverall  reform  agenda  and  need  to  have  a  high  priority  during  all  phases  of  HSDP2.  Local \ngovernments  and  staff  must  lead  information  campaigns,  with  coordination  and  advice  from \nMOH.  \n \n23. \nHSDP  helped the  FGP  system  improve  service  quality  by  (i)  introducing  a  capitation \npayment and performance-based contract, (ii) applying licensing for FGP quality assurance, (iii) \nproviding  training  and  equipment,  and  (iv)  establishing  a  good  working  environment  by \nrehabilitating and rebuilding facilities. However, training consisted of only one short course and \nwas  not  followed  by  supervision  or  on-the-job  advice.  Similarly,  training  impacts  were  not \nanalyzed.  Surveys  thus  reported  limited  knowledge  and  practice  of  standard  protocols.  The \npopulation must have confidence  in FGP and PHC to reduce dependency on hospitals. Quality \nis a major factor in raising confidence. HSDP2 thus emphasizes improving the service quality of \nFGPs and soum health centers and will provide a comprehensive package of training courses, \non-the-job  advice,  and  systematic  impact  assessments.  These  components  will  be  further \nsupplemented by continuing education.   \n \n24. \nIts  Limited  Utilization. \nInternational assistance for the public health sector, after peaking in 1994, has since declined in \nabsolute size and  in  share  of  public  health  expenditure,  which  declined to 12% in 2000  from \n32% in 1994.  Appendix 3 provides details of recent  health  sector  investments.  The  purposes \nand  priorities  of  various  funding  agencies  are  not  always  consistent  with  those  of  the \nGovernment.  For  instance,  external  investment  in  specialized  hospitals  and  advanced \nequipment could divert or even distort Government\u2019s spending priorities in the heath sector if not \ncarefully planned. Inputs are sometimes duplicated. Strategies and approaches used in external \nassistance  are  not  necessarily  compatible  with  each  other,  thus  confusing  local  governments \nand communities involved in donor programs.  \n \n25.  Many examples of suboptimal use of donor  assistance can be cited. The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) has highlighted that goods and services provided by donors are often left \nunused or underutilized. WHO also observed that too many consultants cover the same areas \nand produce too many reports for MOH to digest, leading to unutilized consultant inputs. Impact \n\nInternational  Assistance  and \n\nLack  of  Harmonized \n\n                                                 \n6  Information sources on the FGP evaluation are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nanalysis  and  monitoring  are  not  systematically  done,  either  by  donors  or  the  Government. \nEffective coordination and monitoring mechanisms  are needed to ensure that inputs and policy \nadvice  are  consistent  and  complementary.  External  assistance  must  be  optimally  utilized. \nHSDP2  will  help  build donor  coordination  capacity  and  mechanisms  of  MOH  and  will  help it \ncreate a conducive environment for effective donor assistance.        \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nGoal and Objectives \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nsuch as women and children in target areas. HSDP2 has two objectives:  \n \n\nHSDP2\u2019s  goal is to  improve  the  health  of  people,  especially  the  poor  and  vulnerable, \n\nImprove quality and utilization of health services in rural areas, especially for the \npoor and vulnerable. \n\nBuild  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  health  sector,  based  on  the  reform \nachievements  and  institutional  developments  of  HSDP  in  sector  efficiency, \neffectiveness, and sustainability.  \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\n \nB. \n \n27. \nHSDP2  has  three  components,  which  were  designed  through  intensive  national  and \nlocal  consultations  with  key  stakeholders,  paying  attention  to  the  needs  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable:  (i)  integrated  improvement  of  rural  health  services,  (ii)  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment, and (iii) project management.  \n \n28. \nComponents  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  have  an  impact  nationwide,  while  component  (i)  will  be \nimplemented in  five  rural  aimags  (Bayanhongor,  Dornod,  Dzavhan,  Ovorhangay,  and  Hentiy), \nwhich were selected for their level and severity of poverty, level of infant and maternal mortality, \nand  incidence  of  infectious  diseases.  The  profiles  of  the  HSDP2  aimags  are  in  Appendix  4. \nHSDP2 will invest in areas that will have the greatest impact on the poor, women, and children.   \n \n\n1. \n\nIntegrated Improvement of Rural Health Services \n\n \n29. \nThis component focuses on improving access to, utilization of, and quality of basic PHC \nservices in an integrated way in the HSDP2 aimags. Investments will be made at the bag, soum, \nand  aimag  levels.  Factors  and  challenges  affecting  service  quality  and  utilization  will  be \ncomprehensively addressed  by (i)  improving  working  conditions  by  rehabilitating  facilities  and \nproviding equipment; (ii) upgrading knowledge and skills of staff; (iii) providing incentives to staff \nto  work  in  rural  areas, and  meet  the  needs of  the  poor  and  vulnerable;  and  (iv)  providing \nparticipatory and informative public heath campaigns to create demand for quality PHC services, \nand improve community, and family health and nutrition practices.  \n \nBasic health  services  strengthened  under  this  component  include  maternal  and  child \n30. \nhealth (MCH) services and infectious disease control,  which contribute to reaching MDGs and \nproviding  cost-effective  health  services  to  combat  prevalent  diseases.  The  scope  of  these \nservices,7 in  line  with  life-cycle  approach,  includes  immunization;  growth  monitoring;  school \n\n                                                 \n7 The framework of the package is  defined in the government policy in line with the World Development Report, 1993, \nand ADB Policy for the Health Sector, 1999. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nhealth;  integrated  management  of  child  illness;  nutrition;  reproductive  health  services;  safe \nmotherhood (antenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care); basic neonatal care; breastfeeding; \ntuberculosis  control;  sexually  transmitted  infection  control;  water-borne  disease  control;  and \nprevention  of  noncommunicable  diseases,  particularly coronary heart  diseases,  hypertension, \nand diabetes,  which  are  related  to  inappropriate  diet  and  smoking.  Nutrition  support  should \nalways be a part of an integrated approach. HSDP2 will help all health workers provide these \nservices effectively, in accordance with health workers\u2019 terms of reference.  \n \nFunds for recurrent operating and maintenance costs must be available to make optimal \n31. \nuse  of  capital  investments.  The  Government\u2019s  support  for  training  and  public  information \ncampaigns must be secured. Incremental financial requirements associated with HSDP2 will be \nassessed annually and included in the aimag health budget plan.   \n \n\na. \n\nSoum Health Service Development \n\n32. \nA capitation payment system linked with performance-based contracts will be introduced \nat  rehabilitated or rebuilt  soum  health  centers  and  then  rolled  out  to  the  remainder of HSDP2 \naimags. The purpose of the capitation system incentives is to promote efficient management by \nservice  providers;  improve  quality  performance,  especially  in  essential  health  services;  and \nincrease responsiveness to the needs of the poor. Capitation rates, performance indicators, and \nmonitoring methods will follow FGP mechanisms but adjusted to rural needs, delivery care, and \ninpatient  needs.  An  international  consultant will  help  HSDP2  aimag  health  departments  and \nsoum health centers make a detailed action plan to implement a capitation system and establish \nmonitoring mechanisms. A series of workshops and meetings is planned.    \n \n33. \nAround  13  soum  health  centers  will  be  upgraded  and  around  10  soum  health  centers \nrebuilt where they are. The requirements for civil works for soum health centers will be met by \nadopting  a  flexible  approach,  which  will  reflect  the  services  provided  (basic  clinical  services, \npreventive  services, and health  education  and  health  promotion);  actual  utilization; and  other \nrequirements  such  as  staff  residences  and  community  rooms  as  incentives  to  rural  health \nworkers. Energy-efficient design with appropriate technical services such as telephones, heating, \nwater, sanitation, and waste management will be provided. Renewable energy measures will be \nadopted.  Downsizing  of  facilities  and  adoption  of  energy-efficiency measures are  expected to \nsubstantially  reduce  running  cost,  particularly heating,  which  accounts  for  40\u201360%  of  costs. \nMaintenance  requirements  will  be  identified,  a  plan  developed,  and  financial  arrangements \nagreed on before work commences. During the first year, a civil works survey will be undertaken \nto  assess  these  points,  make  an  inventory,  and  develop  designs.  An  environmental \nmanagement  plan  will  be  prepared,  together  with  monitoring  systems.  Health center  boards, \nwhich will be set up to  promote community  participation  in  health  center  management,  will  be \ninvolved in designing the health centers.   \n \n34. \nBased on the agreed-on role of soum health centers and the need to provide essential \nservices, a set of basic equipment will be provided to all soum health centers in HSDP2 aimags. \nThe equipment at this level will  be similar to that of FGPs and outreach kits of FGP doctors but \nadjusted to rural and obstetric needs as well as for environmental management.     \n \n35. \nInformation and communication technology  (ICT) services will be provided at the soum \nand aimag levels to (i) improve office function and administration, (ii) strengthen HMIS , and (iii) \nsupport distance learning. HMIS at the soum level will focus on collecting and analyzing data on \nhealth  status  and  service  utilization,  and  on  improving  services  delivery.  HMIS  is expected to \nrecord  epidemiological  and  activity  data  at  source  and  prepare  electronic  patient  records.  For \n\n\fdistance learning, this component will provide electronic access to health documents, up-to-date \nprotocols and initiatives  [initially  through  compact  disc  read-only  memory  (CD-ROM)  and  then \nthrough network]. Soum health centers will be connected through e-mail for online consultations \nwith HSDP2 aimag hospitals. CD-ROMs, to be developed by the  MOH Directorate for Medical \nServices  (DMS),  will  supplement  distance  learning.  An  international  training  specialist  will \nprepare a distance-learning plan; develop concepts, training curricula, and training materials for \ndistance learning; and establish a health library.  \n \nDue to poor electricity and telephone  infrastructure, limited budget for operational costs, \n36. \nand  health workers\u2019  limited  ICT  experience,  careful  and  phased  approaches  are  required  to \nensure  the  success  of  ICT  support.  International  consultants  will  help  HSDP2  aimag  health \ndepartments  assess  infrastructure  status  and  operational  costs  and  develop  a  phased  ICT \naction plan (system, software, supply, and training). Training will be provided.  \n \n37. \nSoum  health  center  staff  will  receive  training.  Senior staff  will  receive training  in  the \nbasics of management. Efficient management is especially important  to implement a capitation \npayment  mechanism.  This  training  will  be  organized  centrally  by  DMS,  but  will  be  delivered \nlocally through outreach branches.  \n \n38. \nBag  feldshers  will  be  trained  to  improve  public  health  knowledge  and  skills  in \naccordance with their job description, and, where necessary, provided with basic equipment.  In \nparticular,  feldshers  in  remote  bags  will  receive  motorbikes  to  increase  their  outreach  range. \nParticular attention will be given to (i) health education and promotion; (ii) routine health check-\nups  and  consultation,  and  preventive  and  public  health  service  in  MCH  and  nutrition;  and  (iii) \ncollection and analysis of data for HMIS. MCH kits have been distributed to all bag feldshers by \nother agencies, and HSDP2 will  help feldshers use these kits more efficiently and enhance  the \nimpacts of feldshers\u2019 activities.    \n \nBag feldshers, with the assistance of soum and aimag staff, will intensively and regularly \n39. \norganize a wide range of health education and promotion campaigns to improve community and \nfamily  health  and  nutrition  practices  and  raise  public  awareness of HSDP2 goals and scope. \nHealth  education  materials  and  equipment  will  be  provided  to  bags  and  soums.  Campaign \nimpact  will  be  assessed  and  best  performance  rewarded.  The  campaign  budget  will  cover \nprofessional  technical  support,  material  supplies,  operational  and  logistical  costs,  and \nperformance  incentives.  Feldshers  will  prepare  an  annual  campaign plan in close  consultation \nwith soums and communities.   \n \n\nb. \n\nReferral System Support \n\n40. \nInter-soum  and  aimag  hospitals  will  be  strengthened  as  the  first-referral  system  for \ntargeted  essential  services,  particularly  MCH  services  in  HSDP2  aimags.  Five  inter-soum  and \nfive aimag  hospitals  will  be  upgraded and  equipped.  The  list  of  equipment  follows  the  first-\nreferral  units  provided  under  HSDP,  but  will  be  adjusted  to  meet  rural  needs.  Clinical  and \nmanagerial training will be provided to improve quality of referral services.   \n \n41. \nAssistance  will  be  provided  to  rehabilitated  facilities  at  the  soum,  inter-soum,  and \nHSDP2  aimag  levels  in  environmental  management. A monitoring  system will be also set up. \nHSDP2 will procure medical waste containers at rehabilitated/rebuilt soum health centers and \ncover the cost of transporting collected medical waste to aimag hospitals for disposal. A cost-\neffective  incinerator  will  be  procured  and  installed  at  each  HSDP2  aimag  hospital.  Detailed \nmedical waste m anagement guidelines will be developed and training organized.      \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Capacity Development  \n\n \n42. \nHSDP  initiated  a  reform  process  that  defined  the  direction,  and  provided  the  basis  for, \nhealth sector development. To develop the health sector and improve sector efficiency, equity, \nquality,  and  sustainability,  ongoing  reforms  must  be  consolidated  and  sector  capacity \nstrengthened to plan, manage, coordinate, and monitor system development.    \n \n\na. \n\nConsolidation of Reform in System Development  \n\n \n43. \nHSDP supported the shift to PHC, quality assurance, and sector rationalization (hospital \nand  overstaffing),  which  were  major  reforms.  HSDP2  will  continue  to  pursue  and  accelerate \nthem, which is indispensable to develop an efficient, effective, and pro-poor health sector.  \n \n44. \nThe shift to PHC has resulted in the  establishment of FGPs in urban areas nationwide. \nUtilization  of  and  users\u2019  satisfaction  with  FGPs  has  been  increasing,  but  strong  support \ncontinues to be required until FGP is firmly rooted. HSDP2 will improve service quality and FGP \nperformance  by  reviewing  FGPs\u2019  performance  and  identifying  training  needs,  especially  in \nmanagement  and  finance, and outreach  services to  the  poor,  women,  children,  disabled, and \nunderserved. Based on identified training needs, all FGPs will be retrained and  50 new doctors \ntrained annually  in family medicine. Training will be linked with MDGs and prevalent diseases. \nEquipment  will  be  provided  to  improve  quality.  Monitoring  of  service  quality,  management, \nservice  utilization,  affordability,  and  satisfaction  among  the  vulnerable  groups  will  be \nstrengthened. HSDP2 will renew advocacy for PHC.   \n \nQuality  assurance  will  be  enhanced  by  strengthening  licensing  and  accreditation \n45. \nmechanisms. Three  years  have  passed  since  the  licensing  system  of  medical  doctors,  FGPs , \nand other major health workers was established and implemented. HSDP2 will assess licensing \nsystem\u2019s performance  and  propose mechanisms  for  greater  quality  assurance  impact.  Recent \namendments in health insurance legislation require all hospitals to become accredited. HSDP2 \nwill review and modify the accreditation system  to make it not only a stronger quality assurance \ntool but also a more effective  management tool. The quality control structures and functions of \nMOH and DMS will be reviewed. Relevant government staff will be trained. HSDP2 will reinforce \nquality  assurance  mechanisms  by  improving  purchaser  and  provider  organizations  and \nsupporting professional associations.  \n \n46. \n A  critical  step  for  hospital  rationalization  is  efficient  hospital  inpatient  management \nleading to a lower accommodation capacity requirement. HSDP2 will review admission policies \nand  inpatient  management  practices,  prepare  guidelines  on inpatient  management,  and  train \nhospital managers. HSDP2 will assess bed requirements in line with  actual utilization rates and \nimproved  management,  and  propose  appropriate  hospital  capacity.  HSDP2  will  also  help \nimprove inpatient management and rationalization of beds at hospitals, as pilots, where modern \ntreatment protocols are introduced or where modern equipment is provided by the Government \nor donors.  \n \nHSDP2  will  help  the  Government  rationalize  staff  by  developing  and  implementing \n47. \ncareer development support schemes to train those who  wish to move to rural areas or leave \nthe public health sector.  A career development support unit (CDSU) will be established in DMS \nto  provide  counseling,  training,  and  social  marketing  to  increase  job  opportunities  for  scheme \nparticipants. Posts vacated by participants will not be refilled.  \n \n\n\fb. \n\nCapacity Building   \n\ninstitutional  capacity \n\nHSDP2  will  strengthen \n\n \n48. \nin  planning,  budgeting,  staffing, \nmanagement,  evaluation,  and coordination  at the national,  aimag  and  soum  levels. HMIS and \noperational  researches  will  be  reinforced  as  management tools. At  the national  level, support \nwill be given to MOH, including DMS, in undertaking sector reform and development.  Critical to \nthe success of HSDP2 is the enhancement of the role of  DMS, which will need to take  the lead \nin capacity building for the  health sector. Under the restructuring of the public health sector,  the \nGovernment  has  decided  to  convert  DMS  to  an  agency  under  MOH.  DMS  will  become the \nimplementation  arm  of  MOH  in  improving  health  care  services while  MOH  will concentrate on \npolicy/strategy development, regulation, and coordination. Training activities will be planned by \nDMS and delivered in close collaboration with other  technical institutions. MOH will coordinate \ntraining to avoid duplication with other international agencies. \n \n49. \nFor training under  the  component  for  integrated  improvement  in  rural  health  services, \nDMS will develop, with the assistance of international consultants, a rural training plan for health \nworkers in HSDP2 aimags. To strengthen decentralized training activities, outreach DMS offices \nwill be set up and equipped in two HSDP2 aimags.   \n \n50. \nA  series  of  nationwide  training  courses  are  also  envisaged  under  HSDP2,  including \ntraining  for  (i) management  and  planning;  (ii)  human  resource  development; (iii)  health care \nfinancing,  health  economics,  and  policies;  (iv)  accreditation  and  quality  assurance;  and  (v) \nclinical areas. HSDP2 will first train trainers at the national level to prepare and monitor health \nmanagement courses and develop guidelines and material.  Aimag and soum health managers \nwill be trained in planning, budgeting, managing, and monitoring health services.  \n \n51. \nTo  build  institutional  capacity  in  human  resource  development,  HSDP2  will  review the \nhuman resource development policy  and regulations and project staffing needs for  2004\u20132007. \nBased on  this  policy,  HSDP2  will  help  MOH develop a workforce  plan,  covering  the  number, \nprofiles, geographical, and professional distribution and job description of human resources, and \ntraining  needs.  The  plan  will  include  specific  measures  to  reduce  turnover  of  health  workers. \nHSDP2  will  provide  training  and  studies  to  build  skills  and  capacities  to  plan  and  monitor  a \nperformance-based  salary  scheme,  which  the  Government  plans  to  introduce.  Preservice \ntraining  of  students  from  rural  areas  and  those  who  can  serve  underserved  areas  will  help \nallocate  more  qualified  staff  to  rural  areas.  Continuing  education  plans,  curriculums,  and \nlearning material will be developed.  \n \n52. \nTo  strengthen  client  responsiveness and  participation of the health sector,  HSDP2 will \nencourage  the  development  of  general  information  material  for  patients  and  clients  on  health \nservice, education, and promotion. HSDP2 will develop and implement the concepts of patients\u2019 \nrights and responsibilities, with a focus on  the requirements of the poor and vulnerable groups. \nComplaint  procedures  will  be  reviewed  and  mechanisms  developed  to  address  clients\u2019 \ncomplaints in a fair and equitable manner.  \n \nHSDP2 will develop MOH capacity and mechanisms to coordinate donor assistance and \n53. \npromote  its  optimal  use.  HSDP2  will  help  MOH  engage  donors  in  strategy  and  action \nformulation,  consolidate  donor  assistance  to  shared  goals  and  strategies,  and  maintain  a \nmonitoring  and  policy  dialogue.  For  optimal  use  of  donor  assistance,  HSDP2  will  help  MOH \nprepare  donor  guidelines  and  set  up  a  functional  structure  to  advise  donors,  review  their \nproposals,  and  propose  safeguards.  HSDP2  will  enable  MOH  to  create  an  environment \nconducive to effective donor assistance and to mobilizing further donor assistance.         \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nProject Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nC. \n \n54. \nThe total cost of HSDP2 is estimated at $17.50 million equivalent, of which an estimated \n$9.26  million,  or  53%,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  local  currency  cost  is estimated at \n$8.24 million equivalent or 47% of the total cost. A summary is shown in Table 2, and details are \nin Appendix 5. \n \n\nCost by Component \n\nTable 2.

The  loan  will  be  repayable  over  32  years  with  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter.  The  borrower  will  be  Mongolia.  ADB  will  fund  100%  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost, totaling 53% of the estimated project cost, and  58% of the local currency cost. \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $3.5  million  equivalent  as  counterpart  financing, \nwhich accounts for 20% of total costs, including financing civil works, taxes and duties, training, \nworkshops, and other recurring costs.

MOH  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  HSDP2.  The  state  secretary of MOH will be the \nproject  director.  A  national steering committee will be  established to provide overall guidance, \nchaired by the state secretary of MOH and composed of senior officials from MOH, Ministry of \n\nCost by Source \n\nADB \nGovernment \n \nTotal \n \nD. \n \n\n\fSocial  Welfare  and  Labor  (MSWL),  MOFE,  Bank  of  Mongolia,  Mongolian  Medical  University, \nState Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO),  DMS, and HSDP2 aimag representatives.  The \naimag  supervisory  groups,  chaired  by  the  aimag  governor\u2019s  office,  will  be  composed  of \nrepresentatives  of  health  department,  aimag  hospitals,  soum  health  centers,  and  bags.  The \ncommittee and  supervisory  groups  will  meet  quarterly  and  be  responsible  for  approving  the \nannual HSDP2 budget and activity plan and reviewing and advising on implementation progress. \nWorking  groups  will  be  established  for  key  areas\u2014health  insurance,  human  resource \ndevelopment, and HMIS. \n \n57. \nA project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up  in Ulaanbaatar. MOH and  the PIU will \nimplement and coordinate HSDP2, undertake procurement and disbursement related to HSDP2, \nand monitor and report on progress against a set of quantitative and qualitative indicators. The \nPIU will closely consult with relevant health facilities, as appropriate. The PIU will have a project \nmanager  and  staff  for  planning,  training,  administration,  accounting,  procurement/civil  works, \nand  equipment.  In  each  HSDP2  aimag  an  aimag  project  coordinator  will  be  appointed  to \noversee the implementation of  HSDP2 at  the  local  level,  to  be assisted by quality assurance \nstaff  and  procurement/civil  works  staff.  Project management  and  monitoring  capacities  at  the \nPIU and aimags will be strengthened. Implementation arrangements (Appendix 6) are generally \nthe  same  as  HSDP  arrangements  that  have  worked  reasonably  well.  HSDP2  will  be \nimplemented  over  five  years,  from  2003  to  2008.  The  HSDP2  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nProcurement of ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil works will be carried out \n58. \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Mongolia\u2019s Public Procurement Law, \nprovided,  however,  that  in  the  event  of  any  inconsistency  between  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  the \nlaw, ADB\u2019s guidelines will prevail.   \n \n59. \nEquipment  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  over \n$500,000; international shopping for contracts over $100,000; and direct purchase for contracts \nless than $100,000. Civil works valued over $1 million will be carried out through international \ncompetitive bidding, and civil works contracts valued at or less than $1 million will be carried out \nunder  local  competitive  bidding,  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and \nMongolia\u2019s Procurement Law. In accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures, eligible foreign contractors \nmay  participate  in  local  competitive  bidding.  The  list  of  indicative  contract  packages  is  in \nAppendix 8.  The indicative civil works and procurement  are in  Supplementary  Appendixes  C \nand D. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services and Training \n\n \n60. \nHSDP2  is  designed  to  reduce  reliance  on  consultants,  as  core  concepts  and  program \nmechanisms for reform-related activities were developed by HSDP, and MOH and the PIU have \naccumulated  managerial  experience.  A  total  of  205  person-months of consulting services (31 \ninternational  and  174  domestic)  will  be  recruited  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for the engagement of international and \ndomestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  or  through  a  firm.  The \nquality-and-cost-based selection method (QCBS) will be applied to consulting firms and detailed \ncosting  based  on  QCBS  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  consultants  will \nprovide  services  in  (i)  capitation  payment,  (ii)  hospital  management  standards,  (iii)  human \nresource  development,  (iv)  ICT  network  development,  (v)  training,  and  (vi)  civil  works  and \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nenvironment. Appendix 9 shows the indicative consultancy requirements. The indicative training \nprogram is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n61. \nAn imprest account will be established by the PIU in a commercial bank acceptable to \nADB  to  expedite  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (January 2001) and detailed arrangements between the Government \nand ADB. The Government may make withdrawals from the imprest account for PIU staff costs; \ntraining,  seminars,  and  studies;  locally  available  material;  domestic  consultant;  rationalization \nincentives;  and  civil  works  contracts  under  local  competitive  bidding.  The  initial  amount to be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. Procedures from ADB\u2019s statement \nof expenditure  will be followed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  account  and  reimburse  individual  SOE \npayments that do not exceed $50,000. \n \n\n5. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit \n\n \n62. \nThe  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nproject performance report and submit them to ADB and MOH within 30 days after the end of \nthe applicable period. Within three months after physical completion, MOH will submit a project \ncompletion  report  to  ADB.  Separate  records  and  accounts  for  all  expenditures  financed  out  of \nthe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  maintained  by  MOH  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  annually  audit  project  accounts,  including financial \nstatements, SOEs, and imprest account records . The audit report should be  submitted to ADB \nin English not later than six months after the fiscal year to which the report relates.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System  \n\n \n63.  MOH  will  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem (PPMES) acceptable to ADB. PPMES  will (i) assess HSDP2 technical performance; (ii) \nevaluate  delivery  of  planned  activities;  (iii)  measure  project  impacts;  (iv)  measure  social  and \neconomic benefits with a focus on the poor, women, and disabled; and (v) monitor achievement \nof MDGs. PPMES indicators will serve as a basis to prepare reports on project implementation \nand the reform process, and cover fiscal impacts, improved use of resources, change in access \nto  services  (particularly  among  the  poor),  improved  service  quality,  cost  savings  from \nrationalization,  client  satisfaction,  and  MDG  progress  status.  Performance  indicators  are  in \nAppendix  10.  Some  indicators  will  be  monitored  through  surveys  financed  by  HSDP2,  while \nothers  will  be  monitored  through  routine  administrative  and  financial  data.  Where  feasible, \nindicators will be disaggregated by socioeconomic level and sex. The monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist and consultants will help MOH and PIU determine  the specific indicators and develop \na cost-effective and efficient monitoring system during the first year of HSDP2.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe  objectives  of  the TA  are to (i)  strengthen  MOH  and  MSWL  capacity  and  improve \n64. \nunderstanding on the output/performance-based budgeting for the new PSFML, and (ii) improve \neffectiveness and sustainability of HIF. The TA will complement HSDP2 in sector strengthening \nby  focusing  on  new  government  initiatives  and  challenges  where  firm  strategies  and \nmethodologies  have  not  been  established.  The  TA  will  finance  16  person-months  of \ninternational  and  48  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  health  care \nfinance,  health  insurance, and HMIS. The TA  will be  implemented over 18 months.  Detailed \n\n\finformation on the TA is in Appendix 11. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants;  and  for  domestic  consultants,  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.     \n \nThe TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA \n65. \nis  estimated  to  cost  $764,000  equivalent,  comprising  $464,000  in  foreign exchange costs and \n$300,000 equivalent in local  currency  expenditures.  ADB  will  provide  $650,000 to finance the \nentire foreign currency expenditures and $186,000 of local currency expenditures, the remaining \n$114,000 equivalent being provided in kind by the Government.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\n \nA. \n \n66. \nThe outcome of HSDP2 should be an improvement in the health status of the population \nin  general,  and  in  the  rural  HSDP2  aimags  in  particular.  The  project  will  benefit  the  whole \npopulation  indirectly  through  nationwide  components  that  support  sec tor reform and institution \nbuilding.  \n \n67. \nHSDP2  will  focus  on  improving  rural  health  services.  Under  the  targeted  rural  health \nservice  component, where  most  HSDP2  funds  are  allocated,  about  400,000  people  in  rural \nHSDP2  aimags,  representing  18%  of  the  total  population,  will  benefit  directly  from  improved \navailability and quality of rural health services.   \n \nHSDP2 will  strengthen  public  health  education  and  preventive  works  at  the  bag  level, \n68. \nrenovate  and  equip  soum  health  centers  and  aimag  hospitals,  train  all  health  system  staff  to \nimprove service delivery, and set up incentives in provider payment arrangements to increase \nattention  to  the  poor.  HSDP2  will  encourage  greater  participation  of  stakeholders. HSDP2 will \nsupport decentralization. Transparent and accountable management with well-trained managers \nwill  ensure  the  delivery  of  quality  service  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including  women  and \nchildren. Most users of PHC are women and children. Most health providers are women in rural \nareas. Women will thus benefit directly from HSDP2.  \n \n69. \nHSDP2  will  (i)  enhance  health  care  institutional  and  individual  capacities  through \nstudies, training, and development activities; (ii) support improvement of the policy capability of \nMOH;  (iii) help  DMS  take  a  stronger  lead  in  developing  institutional  capacities  throughout  the \nhealth sector; (iv) help HIF of SSIGO and its local offices develop their roles and responsibilities; \n(v) train managers and staff at the aimag and soum levels; (vi) support professional associations \nin expanding and deepening reforms; and (vii) strengthen client responsiveness.     \n \nB. \n \n70. \nThe Government is introducing reforms and changes in public sector management and \nfinancing  systems.  However,  if  initiatives are not  accompanied by a corresponding  change in \nthe capacity and capability of stakeholders or  by an efficient monitoring and evaluation system, \nexpected outcomes are not likely to be produced. This risk will be minimized in HSDP2 through \nstrong  capacity-building  support,  provision  of  technical  services,  and  strengthened  monitoring \nsystems.  \n \n71. \nReforms require a change in attitude of staff and clients, and the recognition of the need \nto  provide  quality  services.  Managing  public  perceptions  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  that \n\nRisks \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nthrough \n\nEnvironment \n\nFGPs  have  been  paid \n\nunrealistic  expectations  are  not  encouraged  and  that  changes  are  introduced  in  a  measured \nway. Change management will be a key aspect of general management. The health sector does \nnot  have  strength  in  management.  The  pace  of  change  must  match  that  of  strengthening \nmanagement capability to redirect resources to health promotion and disease prevention and to \nfocus resources on the delivery of quality PHC. \n \n72. \nthe  government  budget  supported  by  HSDP. \nCommencing in 2003, HIF will pay FGPs.  By using HIF to cover FGPs,  the allocation to PHC is \nestimated  to  increase  from  14%  to  19%  of  public  health  expenditures.  However,  noting  the \nshrinking size of HIF and increasing hospital capacity, sustainable funding of the FGP system \nby health insurance is at risk.  It is not certain if the  planned  budget for the FGP system can \naccommodate  enough  incentives  to  improve  services, which  are  required  to  raise  people\u2019s \nconfidence in FGPs. Insufficient funds will hamper PHC reform. Hospitals should be rationalized \nto reallocate funds to PHC and FGP. HSDP2 will support  hospital rationalization through policy \ndialogue and improvement of efficiency in hospital management and MOH capacity building to \nplan and monitor hospital restructuring.  \n \nC. \n \n73. \nHSDP2  will  rehabilitate  and  rebuild  hospitals/health  centers  in  the  five  HSDP2  aimags. \nEnvironmental  benefits  will  be  realized  through  improved  medical  waste  management  and \nwastewater  disposal.  HSDP2  will  ensure  that  environmental  measures  are  put  in  place, \norganize training for health workers and local governments on medical waste management, and \nset up a environment monitoring mechanism. Details are in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n \n74. \nHSDP2 focuses on poverty and gender and aims to focus on the health of the rural poor. \nHSDP2  will invest in  five  aimags,  where  48.5%  of  the  people  are  poor.  Appendix  4  provides \ndetails  on  selected  aimags,  and  Appendix  13  provides  the  poverty  and  gender  analysis, \nincluding the gender plan, and other social analyses. \n \nHSDP2  reviewed ethnic differentials in health and social outcomes.  Although  Mongolia \n75. \ncomprises  over  16  distinct  clans  and  ethnic  groups,  none  is  so  distinct  from  the  dominant \nsociety  as to be  especially  disadvantaged  in  the  development  process.  Therefore,  HSDP2  is \nclassified as  category  C  in  terms  of  indigenous  peoples.  However,  to  facilitate  understanding \nand acceptance of HSDP2 among ethnic minorities, languages familiar to ethnic minorities will \nbe used in information campaigns and local training.  \n \n76. \nThe population overall has good access to health services, but disparities are evident by \nincome  and  locations.  Health  service  utilization  among  the  poor  is  far  lower  than  among  the \nwealthy.8 The poor are also more likely to visit soum health centers, primarily because of access \nand  costs  of  care,  while  higher-income  households  are  more  likely  to  use  aimag and  private \nhospitals.9 The  quality  of  health  services  is  poorer  in  rural  than  urban  areas.  HSDP2  will, \ntherefore,  concentrate  on  upgrading  rural  health  services  and  facilitate  incentives  to  attract \nhealth workers to underserved areas.     \n \n\nSocial Analysis \n\n                                                 \n8   Kainyam,  Tungalag,  Protection  of  Vulnerable  Population  Groups  with  a  focus  on  criteria  for  identification  of                   \n\nvulnerability and its implication for health insurance reform, HMIEC, MOH, Mongolia, 2000.  \n\n9   Mongolia Poverty Assessment in a Transition Economy, World Bank, 1996 \n\n\fRural  PHC  is  provided  by  bag  feldshers  in  communities and by soum health centers. \n77. \nOne major responsibility of bag feldshers is to promote reproductive health.  Most soum health \ncenter  patients  are  women  of  reproductive  age,  and  children.  HSDP2  aimag  hospitals  will  be \nstrengthened to provide quality  services to referred cases of pregnant women, and children. By \nsupporting PHC,  HSDP2  will  also  empower  women  and  improve  their  working  conditions  as \nwomen are crucial in providing rural and urban PHC. More than 98% of the bag feldshers, soum \ndoctors and nurses, and aimag nurses are women. About 95% of aimag doctors are women. In \nurban  areas,  95%  of  FGPs  are  also  women.  HSDP2  emphasizes  assistance  to  PHC, directly \nbenefiting women as patients and as providers through human  resource development. HSDP2 \nthus has a poverty and gender focus.  \n \nE. \n \n\nEconomic Analysis10 \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n78. \nInvestment  under  HSDP2  is  expected  to  yield  substantial  economic,  social,  and \ninstitutional  benefits.  The  major  benefits  from  HSDP2  are  out-of-pocket  savings,  and \nproductivity gains as more resources are channeled to  rural  health.  HSDP2  will  have  several \npositive  health  and  welfare  impacts  that  can  be  quantified  in  economic  terms.  HSDP2  is \nexpected  to  increase  the  number  of  persons  receiving  quality  health  care  and  will  contribute \ndirectly  to  improve  the  productivity  of  target  beneficiaries.  Even  with  relatively  conservative \nassumptions, HSDP2 yields an economic internal rate of return of 24.4%. The real rate of return \nis likely to be higher as healthy workers are able to work more productively and earn more than \nunhealthy workers. These benefits exclude externalities that accrue to HSDP2.    \n \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Impact \n\n \n79. \nHSDP2 has been designed to minimize recurrent cost implications. The improvement of \nthe health service delivery system is intended to reduce wastage, improve the internal efficiency \nof health service delivery, improve energy efficiency of health facilities, thus reducing the cost of \nhealth  care  for  the  individual  and  society.  The  incremental  recurrent  costs  of  HSDP2  arise \nlargely from increased access to quality health care. Although new construction and renovation \nof health facilities are financed by ADB proceeds, local governments must operate and maintain \nthe premises to ensure sustainability. HSDP invests in PHC that is internationally proven cost-\neffective services that, together with minimized recurrent cost, will increase sustainability.      \n \nThe financial sustainability analysis evaluates the impact of HSDP2 on the government \n80. \nbudget.  From  the  total  project  cost  of  $17.5  million,  the  Government  will  finance  about  $3.5 \nmillion  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government\u2019s  annual  share  in  project  costs  will  average \n$680,000,  or  1.1%  of  the  health  sector  annual  budget  of  $53.9  million.  Recurrent  costs  to  be \nborne  by  the  Government  during  HSDP2  are  estimated  at  $590,000  per  year.

HSDPs will reinforce and extend the reforms in \nsector  efficiency,  effectiveness  and  sustainability  and  institutional  development  initiated  by \nHSDP, described below.  \n\n \n\n \n HSDP Achievements  \n\nHSDP Policy Objectives \nand Targets \n\n1. Promote PHC \n\n1.1 Define PHC as the priority strategy \nRestructure  the  health  system \nbased on PHC and an effective \nreferral system  \n\nGuarantee universal access to a \npackage of essential clinical and \npublic health services \n\nThe Government approved the establishment of FGPs nationwide in 1999. With \nthe  assistance  of  HSDP,  the  Government  has  introduced  238  FGPs  to date  in \naimag  centers  and  districts  of  Ulaanbaatar.  FGPs  provide  PHC  services  to  1.1 \nmillion people.    \nMOH has adopted a package of essential clinical and public health services. The \nmain providers of primary health services are soum doctors, bag feldshers, and \nFGPs. Based on an updated list of essential drugs, MOH has developed a list of \nfree or subsidized drugs for the vulnerable and poor. \n \n\nSince  1999,  MOH  through  HSDP  has  conducted  a  nationwide  PHC  information \ncampaign  through  the  mass  media.  Pre-  and  post-campaign  surveys  were \ndeveloped.   \nA reference library for PHC was established at the Mongolian Medical University \n(MMU), accessible to university staff, students, and all family doctors.  \nThe  curriculum  on  PHC  for  medical  studies  was  revised  and  introduced  at \nMongolia in 2000.  \n \n\nHSDP developed a special training program  of 11 modules for family doctors and \nnurses and has trained all family doctors and nurses since 2000.  \n \n\n1.2 To gain the support of the population for PHC \nGain  the  support  of  the  public \nfor PHC \n\nEnsure physicians understand \nand support PHC \n\n1.3. Train, deploy, and support PHC providers \nDevelop PHC services  \n\n1.4. Allocate more resources to PHC \nIncrease percentage of \ngovernment health expenditure \nallocated to PHC \n\nThe Government intends to increase the health sector budget to 5% of GDP as \ntargeted by WHO. The health sector budget reached 4% of GDP and 11% of the \ngovernment total budget in 2002.  \n\n2. Encourage  private health sector participation in health service delivery \n\n2.1. Improve the legal framework for the health sector in a market environment \nDevelop a legal framework for \nthe practice of medicine by  \n \na) developing accreditation \nmechanisms to establish public \nand private health facilities, and \n \nb) establishing licensing \nmechanisms for public or private \nmedical practice. \n \n2.2. Develop mechanisms to finance private sector delivery of health services  \nDevelop private FGP working \nunder contract (see 5.1, \ncapitation payments) \n\nThe  Government  established  a  licensing  and  accreditation  unit  in  September \n1998.  \nStandards  have  been  developed  and  approved  for  soum  health  centers  and \naimag hospitals. Standards for other health facilities are being prepared.  \nMOH  has  developed  and  approved  licensing  mechanisms  for  public  or  private \nmedical practice. \nMore than 9,138 doctors  (some  have  2  or  3  licenses ) and 16,652 paramedical \nstaff have been licensed. \nMOH had accredited 421 health facilities, including pharmacies and drug supply \ncompanies.  MOH recommended improvement of performance of 72 pharmacies.  \n\n A performance contract has been established between FGPs and aimag health \ndepartments in accordance  with  Government  Resolution  149,193  of  2000.    The \naimag  health  department  is  financing  FGPs  in  accordance  with  their  level  of \nperformance.   \nMOH  and  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  have  approved financing \nmechanisms for private hospitals that treat insured inpatients. HIF does not pay \nprivate hospitals for uninsured patients. \n \n\nDevelop payment mechanisms \nfor private hospitals  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2  25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n2.3. Facilitate access to building and equipment for private health service providers \nDevelop guidelines for lease \nand sale of public buildings and \nrooms to private providers \n\nHSDP consultants on privatization have developed guidelines for lease of public \nbuilding rooms to private providers.  Many private clinics and hospitals are renting \npublic buildings and rooms. \n\n2.4. Outsource nonmedical hospital services and medical support services \nIdentify services to be \ncontracted out and develop \nguidelines for contracting \n\nHSDP  consultants  on  privatization  have  identified  and  developed  guidelines  for \ncontracting-out of services. Services for contracting-out to private providers  are \n(i) noncore such as laboratory, X-ray, ultrasound, etc.; and (ii) nonmedical such as \nkitchen,  laundry,  etc.  More  than  20  health  facilities  are  contracting  out  their \nkitchen and laundry services to private providers. \n\n3. Restructuring health facilities \n\n3.1. Rationalize physical health infrastructure in rural areas \nIdentify location of referral \nfacilities in the aimags  \nDevelop a master plan for rural \nhealth facilities  \n\nMOH  approved  locations  of  first-referral  units  in  13  aimags  in  2001.  HSDP \nprovided basic equipment to these units in HSDP areas.  \nA  master  plan  for  rural  health  facilities  was  developed  by  international  and \ndomestic consultants of HSDP.  \n\n3.2.

MOH is reviewing the international consultant's report.  \n \n\nThe  international  consultant  and  local  consultants  of  HSDP  drafted  job \ndescriptions for all categories of health staff.  \nInternational and local consultants of HSDP developed guidelines and submitted \nthem to MOH.    \nMMU is developing programs for continuous training for health staff.  \n\nHSDP  consultants  identified  the  need  for  health  personnel,  and  recommended \nmodifying  student  intake  accordingly.  MMU  stated  that  it  needs  at  least  240 \nstudents every year to as student fees are the school\u2019s main income. HSDP has \nrecommended that Government find alternative financing mechanisms for MMU.   \nEvery year, about 200 MMU graduates begin work as soum and family doctors.     \n\nIncrease the number of qualified \nPHC practitioners  \n \n4.2. Control and progressively reduce the number of health staff in the public sector \nLimit recruitment in public health \nsector  \n\nDuring the last 7 years, public sector staff decreased by 932 people.  \n\n4.3. Improve health personnel mix and distribution \nDevelop incentives for health \npersonnel to work in \nunderserved areas  \n\nMOH,  in  collaboration  with  HSDP,  developed  financial  incentives  for  doctors  to \nwork in remote areas without doctors.  MOH has contracted with 46 doctors to go \nto the remote areas  for at least 3 years. \n\n4.4. Mitigate the negative impact of health facility rationalization \nDevelop a redundancy policy for \npersonnel affected by hospital \nrationalization, including \nallowances for moving to rural \nareas  \n \n\nMOH intends to contract over 40 doctors for services in remote areas .   \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe capitation payment model was approved by order of the minister of health, \nand  the  capitation  rate  approved  by  joint  order  (29/01  January  2000)  of  the \nministers  of  finance  and  health.  All  FGPs  are  financed  by  capitation  payments \nfrom the local budget. \nThe capitation rate is determined by age group and poverty level. For example, \ncapitation payment for  children  under  1  year  from  poor  families   is  higher than \nother age groups from better-off families.  \n\nBypass  fees  for  direct  consultation  at  higher-level  health  services  should  be \nintroduced. Bypass fees are imposed only in Ulaanbaatar.  \n\n5.  Improve  health care financing and management \n\n5.1. Introduce capitation payment for FGP \nDevelop capitation payment for \nFGP \n\nDevelop variable capitation \nrates for vulnerable groups in \nrural areas  \n\n5.2. Introduce incentives to adequately use the referral system \nIntroduce fees for direct visits at \nhigher-level health services (by-\npass fees) for the proper \nfunctioning of the referral \nsystem  \n\n5.3. Introduce cost containment mechanisms for hospital service \nDevelop prospective payment \nfor hospital services  \n \n \n \n5.4. Establish autonomous hospital boards in public hospitals \nEstablish autonomous hospital \nboards  \n\nIn 1998, MOH introduced prospective payment mechanisms for public and private \nhospitals. It changed the prospective payment rate in early 2002. The prospective \npayment mechanism  is  based  on  the  population  covered  by  hospital  and  local \ndisease profiles .  \n\nHospital boards were established in all public hospitals in 1998. On the basis of \nthe  lessons  learned,  implementation  arrangements  were modified  in 1999  with \nADB approval.  Each aimag  now  has  one hospital board with representatives of \nmedical  staff,  local  government,  private  sector,  community,  and  all  aimag \nhospitals.  The  hospital  board  supervises  hospital  services  and  establishes \nperformance contracts with every hospital in the aimag and districts. The hospital \nboards in the three HSDP  aimags  (Dorngovi,  Hovd, and  Khubsgul) are working \nsatisfactorily.  In  other  aimags  and  districts  of  Ulaanbaatar,  however,  hospital \nboards are not yet established.   \nTraining  of  hospital  administrators,  fellowships,  and  study  tours  are  to  be \nundertaken. \n\n6. Promote the  poor and vulnerable groups \n\n6.1. Identify vulnerable groups to better target support \nIdentify vulnerable groups \u2014 \npeople who need special \nattention to maintain and \nimprove their health  \nIdentify the poor \n \n\nTo  maintain  and  improve  the  health  of  vulnerable  groups,  MOH  introduced \ncapitation payment rates adjusted by poverty level. These are applied in financing \nFGPs but not in allocating resources for soum health centers .   \n\nFurther work is required to identify properly the poor. (Identification of the poor is \nbased on self-declaration.)  \n\nMonitoring access to and utilization of health services by the poor commenced on \n1 January 2001. \n\n6.2. Guarantee access to essential health services for the poor and vulnerable groups \nMonitor impact on utilization of \nhealth services for the poor and \nvulnerable groups  \nDevelop incentives for health \npersonnel to work in rural and \npoor areas  \nEnsure financing of essential \nhealth services for the poor and \nvulnerable groups  \n\nTo guarantee the availability of essential health services, MOH provides financial \nincentives  for  doctors  who  intend  to  work  in  remote  areas,  where  there  is  no \ndoctor.  \nFinancing of essential health services for the poor and vulnerable groups at FGPs \nservices  is  satisfactory,  but  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  are  not  guaranteed \ninpatient  services.  Outpatient  services  at  all  levels  are  available  for  everyone, \nincluding the poor and vulnerable groups.   \nHSDP  built  39  FGP  clinics  on  the  periphery  of  Ulaanbaatar, where many poor \npeople live. \n\nFGP = family group practice, GDP = gross domestic product, MMU = Mongolian Medical University, MOH = Ministry \nof Health, O&M = operation and maintenance, PHC = primary health

The  public  health  policy  and  other  national  health  programs, \nincluding  the  Soum  Health  Development  Program,  have  been  endorsed  and  provide  a \nframework for strategic development of the health sector. However, in view of rapid change in \nthe  environment,  MOH  needs  to  review  the  continued  applicability  of  some  programs  and \ndevelop  policies,  particularly  those  related  to  health  financing  and  government-wide  financial \nreforms, to ensure a comprehensive and coherent health sector strategy.   \n \n2. \nThe Public Sector Finance Management Law (PSFML) was approved in 2002 and is to \nbe  effective  from  2003.  The  Government  expects  to  move  rapidly  from  conventional  input- to \noutput-based  budgeting.  Since  PSFML  requires  public  agencies  (including  hospitals)  to  be \nfunded based on their outputs or products, the outputs that hospital and health services provide \nneed to be defined and their costs estimated. This process will help identify population needs, \nassess  budget  needs  to  address  these  concerns,  and  target  resources  to  areas  with  the \ngreatest  need  and  with  the  greatest  inequity  in  health  outcomes.  In  the  health  sector,  PSFML \nwould  give  MOH  more  control  over  the  budget  process  and  the  use  of  funds  to  meet  overall \nsector  objectives.  PSFML  shifts  the  responsibility  for  health  care  budget  planning  and \nadministration  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE)  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  aimag \ngovernors\u2019  offices  to  MOH  central  and  aimag  offices.  The  PSFML  will  ensure  appropriate \nallocation  for  health  care  at  the  aimag  level.  The  new  process  can  help  streamline  the  health \nsystem, leading to rationalized services and better-targeted interventions. \n \n3. \nMOH will have to prepare to administer and monitor reforms, staff will require training in \nmanagement and output-based budgeting, activity and service costs will need estimation based \non  output/performance,  and  performance  indicators  will  need  to  be  identified.  MOH  lacks  staff \nand  the  skills  mix  to  address  this  challenge.  Staff  should  be  trained  and  deployed    for  these \nfunctions,  and  the  skills  mix  and  capacity  strengthened,  at  the  central  and  aimag  levels,  to \nensure  proper  training,  administration,  and  monitoring  of  the  new  financial  and  management \nsystems. \n \n4. \nThe  role  of  the  Health  Insurance  Fund  (HIF)  in  supporting  public  sector  health \nexpenditures  and  complementing  government  budgetary  allocations  is  expected  to  increase \nsignificantly. In 2002, the sources of health care financing were government budget  (74%), HIF \n(23%),  and  cost  sharing  by  patients  (3%).  Services  covered  under  HIF  include  inpatient    and \noutpatient care, and drugs. HIF was established in 1994 and is administered by the State Social \nInsurance General Office (SSIGO) in the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MSWL). Health \npolicy and regulations are developed under MOH direction, but health insurance implementation \nand management are under MSWL\u2019s direction.  The evolving roles and functions of HIF should \nbe  made  clear,  and  the  links  between  health  policy  and  health  insurance  implementation \nstrengthened. \n \n5. \nHIF  aims  at  universal  coverage  through  a  combination  of  compulsory,  voluntary,  and \nemployer-employee contributions. Almost 70% of HIF income is from compulsory employer-paid \npremiums.  Voluntary  contributions  were  abolished  recently  and  those  identified  under  social \nassistance programs are eligible to receive government subsidies. However, the impact of these \nreforms on the vulnerable, underserved, and poor is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that a \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n39 \n\ngrowing number of people, as many as 15% of the population, remain without health insurance \ncoverage,  with  some  groups  more  affected  than  others  either  due  to  adverse  selection  or \nliquidity  constraints.  People\u2019s  health  could  be  adversely  affected  if  quality  basic  health  care  is \nnot  easily  accessible  and  affordable.  The  system  suffers  from  moral  hazard,  as  appropriate \nregulations and criteria on service use (e.g., hospital admission criteria, length of hospital stay, \netc.)  and  quality  control  mechanisms  on  service  delivery  are  lacking.  PSFML  has  persuaded \nHIF to improve premium collection, streamline pricing mechanisms, set controls, and establish \nchecks and balances. \n \n6. \nMOH is working to formalize an essential health care package. The package will focus \non  the  basic  health  needs  of  children  (child  survival  services,  immunization,  integrated \nmanagement  of  childhood  illnesses,  nutrition);  women  (safe  motherhood,  basic  reproductive \nhealth  care,  including  deliveries  and  pre-  and  postnatal  care);  and  adults  (screening  and \ntreatment for tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes). The package has to be refined and its \ncost  estimated  to  provide  the  total  cost  for  package,  which  should  be  supported  by  the \nGovernment.  \n \n7. \nAn  effective  health  management  information  system  (HMIS)  is  essential  to  support \nhealth sector reforms and to monitor project and program outputs. The HMIS framework needs \nreview  and  streamlining  in  accordance  with  changing  requirements  of  the  health  sector.  For \nexample, PSFML will require routine data collection to budget, target, and assess performance. \nTools  will  have  to  be  developed  and  timely  data  collected  and  analyzed  for  effective  decision \nmaking.  To  collect  and  analyze  data  and  routinely  monitor  financial  and  health  performance \nindicators,  a  strong  HMIS  is  essential.  MOH  is  trying  to  refine  HMIS  but  lacks  the  skills, \ncapacity, and support to do so. \n \nB. \n \nThe technical assistance (TA) will (i) strengthen MOH and MSWL capacity and improve \n8. \nunderstanding  of  output  and  performance-based  budgeting  as  required  under  PSFML,  and  (ii) \nimprove  HIF\u2019s  effectiveness  and  sustainability.  The  TA  complements \nin \nstrengthening  capacity  to  address  sector  financing,  budgeting,  and  sustainability  issues \ncomprehensively  within  the  framework  established  by  PSFML  and  health  sector  strategies; \nproviding strategic planning support; and developing systems to support MOH and HIF through \ntimely and reliable collection and analysis of financial and health performance indicators.   \n \nC. \n \n9. \nDrawing on the draft national health policy, public health policy, and other national health \nprograms,  the  TA  will  help  MOH  ensure  that  health  sector  strategies  are  comprehensive  and \nconsistent,  and  define  and  strengthen  the  linkages  between  sector  strategies  and  health  care \nfinancing  (including  health  insurance)  policies.  The  TA  will  build  capacity  in  MOH  to \ncomprehensively  review  and  refine  the  health  sector  strategy,  and  build  capacity  in  MOH  and \nSSIGO to streamline and formulate pricing and payment mechanisms, including capitation, case \nmix, single purchaser systems, and others. \n \n10. \nTo support implementation of PSFML, the TA will build capacity in MOH to cost services \nand apply output-based budgeting, through workshops and training. The TA will also help MOH \nfinalize  the  essential  health  care  package,  and  cost  the  package.  The  TA  will  help  MOH \nstreamline  routine  HMIS   and  operational  researches,  build  capacity  to  handle  financial  and \n\nScope and Methodology \n\nthe  project \n\nObjectives \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nnonfinancial data for decision making, and finalize performance-based indicators and targets for \noutput-based budgeting.   \n11. \nThe  TA  will  help  strengthen  national  consensus  on  the  role  and  expectations  of  social \nhealth insurance by supporting a workshop/conference on transition economies\u2019 experiences in \nsocial health insurance. The TA will help strengthen routine working mechanisms between MOH \nand  SSIGO  to  strengthen  the  links  between  health  policy  development,  formulation  of \nregulations,  and  implementation  of  health  insurance.  The  TA  will  build  capacity  to  develop  a \npackage  of  health  benefits  (using  principles  of  evidence-based  medicine  and  technology \nassessment); regulations; procedures; provider payment mechanisms; and guidelines on health \ncare  use  and  on  quality  controls  for  care  provided  by  health  service  providers  under  contract \nwith  SSIGO.  The  TA  will  also  build  capacity  to  reassess  the  situation  among  the  poor  and \nunderserved  and  to  propose  mechanisms  to  protect  the  poor  against  catastrophic  illness.  The \nTA  will  help  improve  understanding  of  international  social  health  insurance  models  through \nstudy tours, and train staff in social health insurance (procedures, guidelines, and administration \nof social health insurance) through workshops at central and local levels of SSIGO and health \nservice providers.   \n\n \nCost and Financing \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nD. \n \n12. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $764,000,  of  which  $464,000  is  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $300,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance $650,000, covering  the entire foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $464,000  and  $186,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  through  the  provision  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  space  for  TA  administration,  and  workshop  facilities.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan of the TA are in Table A11.1.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nThe TA will commence on July 2003 and be completed by December 2004. MOH will be \nthe  executing  agency.  MSWL  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  TA  component  on \nstrengthening  social  health  insurance.  The  TA  will  have  a  steering  committee  headed  by  the \nstate secretary of MOH, with members including the vice minister; chair of the Social Insurance \nNational Council, MSWL; Director of Economics Operations, Ministry of Finance and Economy; \nand  heads  of  task  forces  and  other  relevant  persons.  The  steering  committee  will  oversee \ngovernment  coordination,  provide  timely  guidance  and  management  support  to  the  TA,  and \nmeet quarterly. \n \n14. \nA team of international and local  consultants  will  implement  the  TA.  It  will  provide  16 \nperson-months of international consultants, who will be specialists in health policy and planning, \nhealth care finance, health insurance, and HMIS. The TA will also provide 48 person-months of \nlocal  consultants  with  expertise  in  health  policy,  health  economics,  public finance, insurance, \npoverty  assessment,  HMIS,  and  legal  issues.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  Procurement  of  office  equipment,  computers,  and  printers  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n41 \n\nTable A11.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n($'000) \n\nForeign \nExchange  Currency \n\nLocal \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nItem \nA.

A  limited  number  of  specific  environmental  and  social  impacts  may  result from \nHSDP2  implementation  but  can  be  avoided  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  generally  recognized \nperformance  standards,  guidelines,  or  design  criteria.  The  following  potential  environmental, \nhealth, safety, and social impacts of the HSDP2 were analyzed: \n\ncomprehensive  waste  management  plan,  including  handling  and  disposal  of \nmedical and bio-hazardous waste; \n\nliquid waste and sewage disposal; \n\n \n(ii) \n \n(iii)  management of construction impacts over the planned building period (sediment \n\nand erosion control, emissions, noise, traffic, worker health and safety); \n\nhygiene and implementation of good hospital management practices; and \n\nemployee health and safety training. \n\n \n\n \n2.   \nHSDP2  will  upgrade  primary  health  care  (PHC)  facilities,  including  rural  soum health \ncenters,  first-referral  inter-soum and  aimag  hospitals,  as  well  as  training  facilities in  five  rural \naimags:  Bayanhongor,  Dornod,  Dzavhan,  Ovorhangay,  and  Hentiy.  About  10  soum  health \ncenters will be renovated, 10 new soum health centers rebuilt on the existing locations, and 5 \ninter-soum hospitals and 5 existing aimag hospitals renovated. During the first year of HSDP2, a \nlist  of  facilities  for  civil  works  will  be  finalized  and  a  civil  works  survey  undertaken to assess \nactual needs, make an inventory of facilities and their utilization, and develop flexible standard \ndesigns. Downsizing of facilities, resulting in lower bed capacity, will be pursued in the  HSDP2 \ndesign.  \n \n3. \nThis  appendix  summarizes  the  issues  related  to  environmental  evaluation  of  aimag \nhospitals and  soum health centers. Aimag hospital issues are  based on the aimag hospital at \nChoibalsan, Dornod. The amount of rehabilitation works it needs is typical of the extent of civil \nworks required for the other aimag hospitals included in HSDP2, and also represents the type of \ncivil  works  at  inter-soum  and  soum  health  centers,  albeit  on  a  much  smaller  scale.  The \nChoibalsan hospital is the biggest aimag hospital covered by  HSDP2. The hospital has a 365-\nbed  capacity  and  offers  emergency,  inpatient,  outpatient,  intensive  care,  maternity,  infectious \ndiseases, ophthalmology, dental, and psychiatry services. This study also discusses the  scope \nof  environmental  issues  related  to  soum  health  care  centers,  based  on  review  of  Sergelen, \nHulunbuir, Bulgan and Dashbalbar Choibalsan soum health centers, which are representative of \nHSDP2 conditions.  \n \nB. \n\nAssessment \n\n1. \n\nClimate and Geography \n\n \n4. \nThe climate in  HSDP2  areas  is  continental,  with  very  hot,  dry  summers  and long, cold \nwinters. Summer and winter temperatures can vary significantly, due primarily to differences in \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n43 \n\n2. \n\nChoibalsan Aimag Hospital \n\nelevation (720\u20132,060 meters above sea level). Average January temperatures range from \u201316 \nto \u201324 degrees Celsius. Mongolia has over 260 sunny days a year, with winds especially strong \nin spring. The rainy season is short, from mid-July to September, with precipitation of less than \n50 millimeters (mm) average per month and a maximum of about 75 mm in July.  HSDP2 areas \nare  not  densely  populated,  have  little  development  activities,  and  are  not  adjacent  to \necologically sensitive areas.  \n \n \n \n5. \nDornod is one of the poorest aimags. It has among the highest levels of infant mortality \nand  infectious  diseases  in  the  country,  and  some  of  the  highest  death  rates  due  to  high \nincidence  of  liver  cancer,  tuberculosis,  and  infectious  diseases,  and  due  to  high  maternal \nmortality  and  infant  mortality.    \u201cHealth  Sector  of  Mongolia  80  Years\u201d  indicates  the  following \nstatistics:  liver  cancer,  9.33/10,000  people;  tuberculosis,  31.56/10,000;  infectious  diseases, \n227.6/10,000;  infant  mortality,  46.4/1,000;  and  maternal  mortality,  1.41/1,00.  These  numbers \nare higher than those other aimags, and other developing countries.  \n \n6. \nChoibalsan (population 45,000), the capital of Dornod (population 85,000), is Mongolia\u2019s \nfourth  largest  city  (after  Ulaanbaatar,  Darkhan,  and  Erdenet).  Apart  from  animal  husbandry, \nseveral important industrial activities are located within the city, including a large abattoir, wool \nproduction, and flour milling.  \n \n7. \nThe  Cholibalsan aimag  hospital  complex  is  in  the  city  center  and  consists  of  1\u20134-story \nbuildings  for  inpatients,  maternity,  laundry,  morgue,  pediatrics,  outpatients,  and  infectious \ndiseases. Public transportation connects the hospital to the city. \n \n8. \nThe  hospital  is  connected  to  the  municipal  wastewater  system,  which  functions \nsatisfactorily.  Electrical  supply  is  provided  through  a  local  grid  system  with  little  or  no \ninterruptions.  No backup power supply is considered for this location but may be needed for the \nother project aimag hospitals and soum health centers if power supply is rated unreliable during \nthe civil works survey. Consideration would then be given to the provision of  renewable electric \nsupply  measures  such as solar panel or wind generators.  Solid waste collection and disposal \nare  provided  by  the  local  city  authority.  However,  the  hospital  is  responsible  for  the  collection \nand disposal of its medical waste. This waste is disposed of on the hospital premises by burning \nin an onsite, locally constructed incinerator.  \n \nSurface  Water  and  Groundwater.    The  hospital  is  within  500  meters  (m)  from  the \n9. \nnearest  surface  water  source  (Kherlen  River),  which  is  abundant  and  used  to  water  livestock \nand irrigate vegetables. Surface water quality is acceptable, with direct contamination limited for \nthe  most  part  to  unregulated  disposal  of  human  excreta  and  biosediments  resulting  from \nlivestock traffic upstream. The city water supply system provides Choibalsan aimag hospital with \ngood  and  abundant  water  for  drinking,  washing,  and  cooking  24  hours  a  day.  Groundwater is \nsufficient, suitable, and used for drinking, washing, cooking, and irrigating.   \n \nEnvironmentally  Sensitive  Areas  and  Hazards.  No  environmentally  sensitive areas \n10. \nwere observed near the aimag hospitals. However, inadequate attention to the proper disposal \nof hazardous medical waste does pose a potential problem.   \n \nAir  Quality.    Outdoor  and  indoor  air  quality  is  satisfactory  for  the  hospital  and  health \n11. \ncenters.  However,  at  times  airborne  particulates  lower  the  air  quality.  The  movement  of \nlivestock,  pedestrians,  and  vehicles,  as  well  as  strong  winds  may  at  times  cause  slight \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ndeterioration  of  indoor  air  quality,  but  not  frequently  or  severely  enough  to  cause concern. As \nprotection from extreme winter temperatures, coal ash is used as roof insulation. Given the poor \nstructural integrity of many ceilings and roofs, some suspension of coal ash particles in the air, \nwith subsequent respiration by patients and staff, seems likely.  \n \n12. \nVegetation.  Vegetation  around  the  hospital  and  health  centers  is  typically  in  poor \ncondition due to disturbance by grazing livestock, and vehicular and pedestrian traffic. However, \nthe traffic in the vicinity of the hospital complex is low.  \n \n13. \nEndangered Species, Wildlife, and Wildlife Habitat.  There are only a few trees in the \nhospital complex, planted and cared for by hospital staff. Aside from various domestic animals \n(dogs, sheep, horses, goats, and cows), wildlife in and  around  the  hospital  is  limited  to  birds, \nsmall  rodents,  and  common  insects  such  as  grasshoppers  and  flies.  The  presence  of \nendangered species is unlikely.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSoum Health Centers \n\n \n14. \nThe average  soum  population is 3,000,  most of  whom  are  herdsmen.  A  soum health \ncenter  consists of  a  1\u20132-story  building  with  5\u201315  beds.  It  is  fenced and about  20\u201350  m  away \nfrom the neighboring residential/industrial building.  Land use and topography are similar to that \nof the Choibalsan aimag hospital.     \n \n15. \nAt a soum health center, drinking water is brought from a well onsite maintained by the \nsoum administration. Water quality and quantity are acceptable. Human excrement is collected \nin  a  pit  latrine  outside  the  health  center  building  operated  by  clinic  staff.  Wastewater  from \nwashing  and  laundry  drains  into  the  ground.  Medical waste is  burned  in a small  locally  made \nincinerator outside the building near the latrines. Organs such as placentas are buried deep and \naway  from  populated  areas.  Health  centers  pay  inadequate  attention  to  proper  disposal  of \nmedical waste, posing a potential environmental problem. \n \n16. \nSurface  water  is  abundant  in  soums. Groundwater  is  sufficient  and  suitable, and  the \nsource of water for soum health centers. Horses are the main mode of transportation in soums. \nLike hospital areas, soums have no endangered species, wildlife, and wildlife habitat.  \n\n \n4. \n\nMedical Waste Assessment  \n\n \nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) has regulations on collection, transportation, and disposal \n17. \nof medical wastes. Bacteriological laboratory waste should be sterilized in an autoclave, stored \nwith solid waste, and transported for disposal at dedicated solid waste disposal sites. Syringes \nshould  be  collected  in  plastic  buckets  or  safety  boxes  and  either  burnt  or  sent  to  solid  waste \nsites. Dressings should be neutralized in chlorine solutions, lysol, or formaldehyde for 24 hours \nand then disposed of with solid waste. Clinical laboratory wastes should be neutralized and then \ndisposed of through the sewerage system. Special medical wastes (body parts, placenta, etc.) \nshould be stored for several days before transport to waste deposal sites and buried. Cytotoxic \nwaste materials (only at aimag hospitals) should be burned only.  \n \n18. \nAimag  hospitals  and  soum  health  centers  do  not  generally  adhere  strictly  to  these \nregulations,  mainly  due  to  lack  of  local  budget  and,  therefore,  insufficient  waste  containers, \nstorage, and collection facilities; insufficient disposal equipment and transport; and lack of staff \ntraining in waste management and safety procedures.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\nfollow \n\nGovernment  Resolution  N256,  2001  proposes  measures \n\nto  strengthen  waste \n19. \nmanagement for 2002-2006, including establishment of waste disposal sites in environmentally \nacceptable  locations  throughout  the  country.  In  September  2002,  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO)  consultants  assessed  medical  waste  management  practices  at  small,  medium-sized, \nand  large  hospitals  and  clinics,  including  on-site  storage,  collection,  and  disposal,  and \nrecommended improvement in waster management.  \n \n20.  MOH has drafted new regulations to guide  medical waste management. They are based \non WHO  recommendations.  The  guidelines  will  mitigate  health  and  safety  hazards  to  hospital \nworkers  from  toxic  gases,  excessive  radiation,  and  hazardous  solid  waste  such  as  used \ndressings, discarded human body parts, and materials that might contain or have been exposed \nto pathogens. The guidelines will also provide for staff training in safety procedures and medical \nwaste management. \n \n21. \nThe  guidelines  will  provide  standards  for  collection  and  disposal  of  medical  waste  for \nHSDP2 aimag and inter-soum hospitals and soum health centers, and for design of institutional \narrangements  for  environmental  impact  mitigation.  The  design  of  HSDP2  facilities  for \nconstruction  and  operation  will \nthese  mitigation  measures.  An  environmental \nmanagement plan,  including  a    medical  waste  management  plan,  will  be  developed  for  each \nsubproject.  The  environmental  management  plan  will  summarize  proposed  environmental \nmitigation  activities,  including  a  time-bound  action  plan,  and  evaluate  HSDP2 environmental, \nhealth, and safety activities as reflected in the results of periodic and quantitative sampling and \nmeasuring programs. The aimag health department and MOH will provide technical guidance to \nprepare  the  plan,  following  national  guidelines.  The  assistance  of  Ministry  of  Nature  and \nEnvironment (MONE)2 may be required to identify landfills for medical waste disposal. \n \n22. \nThe medical waste management plan will cover infectious, hazardous, and other medical \nwaste, which will be segregated in color-coded containers for treatment and disposal. Provisions \nwill  be  made  to  store  medical  waste  safely  until  it  can  be  removed  for  disposal  at  off-site \nfacilities.  Waste  will  be  transported  in  custom -built  collection  bins  and  transported  in  special \nvehicles.  Human  anatomical  wastes,  blood  and  fluids,  microbiological  waste,  and  other \nbiotechnical waste will be neutralized and buried. Other wastes will be handled and disposed of \naccording to international standards and  procedures  laid  out  in  the  waste  management  plan. \nOn-site medical waste disposal sites that do not adhere to the new regulations will be cleaned \nup  to  required  levels.  The  plan  will  also  incorporate  a  health  care  worker  safety  and  health \nprogram  and  employee training and orientation.  For wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  new \ninternal toilets and septic tanks will be provided to treat wastewater for soum health centers that \ndo  not  have  adequate  systems.  The  local  health  departments  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the plan.  \n \nA  civil  works  quality  and  environment  monitoring  committee  will  be  set  up  at  each \n23. \nHSDP2 aimag to monitor and evaluate HSDP2 compliance with the environmental management \nplan.  The  committee  will  be  composed  of  (i)  the  project  aimag  coordinator;  (ii)  aimag \nprofessional  inspection  services  of  the  MONE;  (iii)  Public  Health  Department,  Policy \nCoordination, and Implementation Division of MOH;  and (iv) the  aimag health department. The \n\n                                                 \n1  A  government  decree,  under  preparation,  will  define  the  role  of  various  agencies  in  different  aspects  of \nenvironmental protection. MONE will regulate issues related to water, air, toxic chemical substances, hazardous \nwastes,  etc.,  while  MOH  will  be  responsible  for  laws  and  regulations  associated  with  health,  sanitation,  food, \ndrinking water, chemical substances, and medical waste. MONE will establish professional inspection services for \neach aimag and for the various soum centers within them. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ncommittee will conduct periodic site supervision visits. The committee\u2019s report will be a part of \nthe project progress report.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConstruction Phase \n\n \n24. \nAdverse environmental impacts due to civil works will be minimal, of short duration, and \nmitigated by design and project management of facilities construction. Trees in HSDP2 aimags \nwill be replanted and other vegetation restored.  \n \n25. \nTo enhance energy efficiency, building standards will be applied to ensure that building \nenvelopes  are  tightened,  making  them  resistant  to  leaks,  which  will  drastically  reduce  the \namount  of  heat  required  by,  for  example,  insulating  foundations,  and  using  extruded  rigid \npolyurethane  insulation,  rigid  insulation  for  roofs,  and  metal  thermally  glazed  windows  and \nexternal  doors.  Coal  dust  will  no  longer  be  used  as  insulating  material. These measures will \nimprove indoor air quality of project health centers. Renewable energy sources will be preferred \nas backup power supply. To prevent potentially harmful emissions from necessary supplemental \nboilers  or  emergency  backup  diesel  generators,  emission  stacks  will  be  located  downwind  of \nbuildings and high enough to minimize exposure of staff and patients to the fumes. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  guidelines  of \nimplementation of the agreed-upon mitigation measures. \n \n \n\nHSDP2  will  meet  the  applicable  ADB  environmental  and  social  policies  and  the \nthe  Government  upon  successful \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\nSOCIAL ISSUES \n\nPoverty and Gender Analysis \n\n \nThe  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project  (HSDP2)  has  a  poverty  and  gender \n1. \nfocus  and  addresses  health  concerns  of  the  rural  poor  and  women,  such  as  infectious  and \ncommunicable diseases and reproductive health. HSDP2 will cover five rural aimags with higher \npoverty  incidence  and  worse  health  outcomes  than  others:  Bayanhongor,  Dzavhan,  Dornod, \nHentiy,  and    Ovorhangay.  Poverty,  health,  and  gender  considerations  justify  the  selection  of \nHSDP2  sites.  This  section  provides  an  overview  of  absolute  and  relative  poverty  and  health \nconditions over time. \n \nPoverty incidence increased from 15% in 19901 to 36% in 1995.2 Absolute poverty has \n2. \nstabilized  overall  since  1995,  except  in  the  aimag  centers  (not  including  Ulaanbaatar), where \npoverty  incidence  increased  due  to  internal  migration  and  growing  unemployment.  The \npopulation living in extreme poverty increased from 1995 to 1998. Poverty is growing. Urs aimag \nhas  the  largest  population  living  below  poverty,  and  Dzavhan,  the  largest  population  living  in \nextreme  poverty.  More  female-  than  male-headed  households  live  in  poverty.  Ovorhangay \naimag has the largest proportion of herdsmen.   \n \nThe  increasing  differential  in  income  translates  into  an  increasing  differential  in  the \n3. \npopulation\u2019s ability to afford health care. Per capita monthly health expenditure is seven times \ngreater  among  wealthier  than  poorer  households.  The  share  of  household  expenditure  for \nhealth  among  the  poor  (2.3%)  is  substantially  larger  than  that  of  the  wealthier  households \n(1.5%).  Several  other indirect costs of health are  unmeasurable, such as travel cost to health \nfacilities, opportunity cost of time, and drug costs.  Many rural health facilities are perceived to \noffer relatively poor quality of care and so patients travel as far as aimag centers and sometimes \nto Ulaanbaatar to attend hospitals.  Health insurance subsidies are offered to those defined as \n\u201cvulnerable,\u201d but the income- or food-poor and the unemployed are less likely to be categorized \nas \u201cvulnerable\u201d under the current definition. \n \n4. \nThe infant mortality rate (IMR) was 64 per 1,000 live births in 2000 (MICS 2000).   MOH \ndata suggest that IMR declined from 64 in 1990 to 35 by 2000, but almost 50% of infant deaths \nare suspected to have been missed through incomplete demographic registration. Rural IMR is \n1.5 times higher than urban IMR, and Dornod aimag has an IMR double that of Dundgobi (which \nhas the lowest IMR). IMR for boys is higher than for girls. \n \n5. \nMMR increased to 161 per 100,000 live births in 1996\u20131998 from 119 in 1990 (Maternal \nMortality  Survey).  In  the  past  decade,  MMR  increased  overall,  with  rural  levels  twice  those  of \nurban  areas.  Dzavhan,  with  the  largest  proportion  of  extreme  poor,  has  the  worst  MMR \u2014four \ntimes  higher  than  in  Bulgan.  Women  from  herder  families  are  at  a  higher  risk  than  others, \nrepresenting  almost  50%  of  all  maternal  deaths.  Diseases  not  related  to  pregnancy  are  the \nprimary  cause  of  mortality,  followed  by  pregnancy  complications.3  Abortion  is  a  growing \nconcern.  At  least  60%  of  deliveries  with  complications  at  aimag  hospitals  were  referred  from \nsoum health centers, primarily due to eclampsia. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 National statistics organization.  \n2 Living Standard Measurement Survey, 1995,1998.   \n3 UNFPA. 2001.

Malnutrition  and  anemia  are  high \n6. \namong  children  and  pregnant  women.  At  least  40%  of  pregnant  women  suffered  from  chronic \nanemia. Poorer households had a higher prevalence of anemia. Poor maternal nutrition leads to \nhigh  maternal  mortality  as  well  as  a  growing  number  of  low-weight babies. With promotion of \nbreast-feeding,  undernutrition  among  infants  decreased.  However,  inadequate  household \nfeeding  practices  have  led  to  relatively  poor  nutrition  among  children  of  2\u20135  years:  12%  of \nunder-5 children were underweight in 1990, and this rate remains the same today. \n \nTuberculosis, associated with poverty and crowded living conditions, is increasing, with \n7. \nthe highest rates reported by Darvhan-uul, Selenge, and Dornod aimags. Respiratory diseases \nare  still  among  the  top  five  diseases. The  health  system  continues  to  require  resources  to \naddress communicable disease concerns. \n \n8. \nHealth service utilization remains high. Vaccination coverage is almost universal among \nchildren  and  pregnant  women,  and  most  deliveries  are  under  the  care  of  skilled  health \npersonnel. On average, at least five outpatient visits per person per year are reported by public \nsector  facilities,  with  utilization  rates  at  Orkhon  aimag  at  least  three  times  higher  than  in \nOvorhangay aimag (lowest use).   \n \nHealth service utilization among the poor is far lower than among wealthier households4. \n9. \nThe poor are more likely to visit soum health centers, primarily because of access and costs of \ncare, whereas the wealthier are more likely to use aimag and private hospitals5. \n \nB.  \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \n\n1. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \nYes \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement?   \n\n \nYes \n\n            Investment  in  the  health  sector  will  help  reduce  diseases  among  the  poor  and  help \nthem  live  a  healthy  life  through  provision  of  medical  services,  public  health,  and  health \npromotion  programs.  Improved  health  will  increase  opportunities  and  capacity  of  the  poor  to \nparticipate in economic activities, care for their families, and pursue educational opportunities.    \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Analysis: Proposed Classification \n\n \n  HSDP2  will  target  poor  aimags.  Under  the  integrated  improvement  of  rural  health \nservices  component,  about  400,000  people  in  five  rural  aimags,  representing  18%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  total  population,  will  benefit  directly  from  improved  availability  and  quality  of  rural \nhealth  services.  About  48.5%  of  the  population  in  these  aimags  is  poor,  compared  to  the \nnational average of 36%. The targeted aimags are not only  poorer but also  have high endemic \ndisease and infant mortality rates, which are composite proxies for poverty incidence, indicating \nthat most of the population in the aimags faces multiple deprivations.   \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4 Kainyam, Tungalag. 2000.

To  reduce  financial  barriers  and \nproviders\u2019 discriminatory attitudes, HSDP2 plans to introduce incentives for service providers to \nsee  the  poor  through  capitation  payment  mechanisms  weighted  by  the  poverty  rate  and \nperformance-based  contracts  as  for  family  group  practices  (FGPs)  in  urban  areas.  Subsidies \nand outreach services for the poor and vulnerable groups are stipulated in the contract.   \n \n            HSDP2 is classified as a core poverty intervention.      \n\n3. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n            International  and  local  consultants  recruited  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance carried out a multilevel consultation process with a wide range of stakeholders. Four \nstakeholder  groups  were  identified  and  consulted  across  a  range  of  issues.  Primary \nstakeholders  included  service  users  and  providers  at  the  bag,  soum,  and  aimag  levels. \nSecondary  stakeholders  consisted  of  national  and  local  policy  and  decision  makers.  The \nanalysis of response showed a high degree of concurrence among  stakeholders on the causes \nand effects of problems in  delivering good-quality and affordable health services, especially to \nthe poor and vulnerable. The main divergence was in perceptions of how the poorest groups are \ntreated,  with  staff  having  a  much  better  opinion  of  their  interventions  than  the  recipients, who \nclearly feel discriminated against by individuals and the system. \n \n \nThe  differences  among  stakeholder  groups  required  a  wide  range  of  participation \nstrategies.  For  service  users  and  service  providers,  the  participatory  appraisal  and  planning \nmethod  was  used.  For  local  and  national  policy-  and  decision  makers,  one-on-one interviews, \ngroup  interviews, and  regional  workshops  were  conducted.  To  deepen  participation,  project \ncomponent  design  was  done  through  counterpart  groups  in  MOH  and  a  multidisciplinary \nsteering committee (MOH,  Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance and Economy, Parliament, \nState  Social  Insurance  General  Office,  university  and  aimag  representatives).  Widespread \nparticipatory  discussions  took  place,  particularly  to  identify  needs  and  demands  for  capacity-\nbuilding activities to implement reform.    \n \n            Participation input proved to be useful and important to project design, not only because \nof  the  information  provided  but  also  because  of  the  resulting  awareness  of  the  value  of \nparticipation and consultation. The consultation loop set up with stakeholders will be maintained. \n       \n\n \n4. \n\nSocial Issues \n\n \n Significant/  \nNonsignificant/ \n        None   \n\nResettlement  None \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nOutput  \nPrepared \n\n \nNo  resettlement  is  expected  in  HSDP2  as  all  civil \nworks take place in existing locations. \n\nNo \n\nGender  \n \n \n\nSignificant  HSDP2  focuses  resources  on  PHC  at  the  bag  and \nsoum levels to best respond to the needs of women \nand  children,  particularly  in  promoting  reproductive \nhealth.

HSDP2  will  improve \nwomen\u2019s  working  conditions.  More  than  98%  of  bag \nfeldshers,  soum  doctors  and  nurses,  and  aimag \nnurses are women. About 95% of aimag  doctors are \nwomen.  In  urban  areas,  95%  of  FGPs  are  also \nwomen.  HSDP2  supports PHC  and  directly  benefits \nwomen workers.   \nHSDP2  will  not  initiate  any  user  fees or cofinancing \nof  services  that  have  risks  of  negative  impact  on \npoor\u2019s  affordability.  HSDP2  will  help  the  health \ninsurance system increase efficiency, poverty focus, \nand  sustainability.  To  ensure  the  poor\u2019s  access to \nservices,  HSDP2  will  organize  surveys  and \nstrengthen  monitoring  mechanisms  on  service \nutilization by the poor and their problems.   \nHSDP2  will  develop  career  development  support \n(CDS) for those who wish to move to rural areas as \nwell as for those who wish to leave the health sector. \nCDS is expected to  have a  positive impact on labor \nproductivity  by  making  available  qualified  doctors \nand  nurses  in  rural  areas  where  such  qualified \npersonnel do not exist, and by  providing pre-service \ntraining. \nHSDP2  will  use \nto  ethnic \ninformation \nminorities, \ncampaigns to communities and at bag-level training.   \nHSDP2 is in environment category B.  Medical waste \nmanagement  will  be \nimproved  when  HSDP2 \nrehabilitates  and  rebuilds  health  centers  and  aimag \nhospitals.  In  designing  civil  works,  the  environment \nmanagement  plan,  including  the  medical  waste \nmanagement plan will be developed. \n \n \n\nfamiliar \nhealth \n\nlanguages \n\nespecially \n\nin \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nSummary of \nInitial \nEnviron- \nmental \nExamination  \n\nGender Plan \n\nC. \n \n10.  Women in Mongolia  live  longer and  are  healthier than men.  Life  expectancy at birth in \n2001 is 61.2 years for men and 68.3 years for women. In terms of healthy life expectancy, which \ntakes into consideration disability in addition to length of life, women have 58.0 years of healthy \nlife, compared to 49.9 years for men.  \n \n11. \nHowever,  these  better  indicators  do not  necessarily  mean  that  women  receive  better \nsocial and health attention. Maternal mortality, which is largely preventable by the application of \navailable medical knowledge and basic technologies, is unacceptably high and does not show \nany  improvement  over  years.  It  may  even  be  worsening.  Women  suffer  from  an  unnecessary \ndisease  burden.  Reproductive  health  conditions  are  the  cumulative  result  of  poverty; \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\neducational, social, and cultural behavior; and health care factors. This  indicates that measures \nto improve reproductive heath must be carefully planned and targeted.        \n \n \n \n12. \nHSDP2 is classified under gender and development because of the significant benefits \nthat women receive. HSDP2 pursues health system reform and health service improvement that \nwill  equally  benefit  men  and  women  but  includes  specific  actions  to  improve  women\u2019s health. \nThis gender plan delineates specific approaches to ensure positive impact on women\u2019s health. \nThis gender plan  is also expected to  help the Government to achieve Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) for women.   \n \n13. \n \n \n\nThe following scope of the gender plan will be implemented as part of HSDP2: \n\n(i) \n\nIntegrated improvement of rural health services  \n \na. \n\nHSDP2 will focus on PHC; strengthen bag feldshers (community nurses), \nwhose  major  responsibility  is  reproductive  health  and  soum  health \ncenters, where more than 30% of patients are women of reproductive age \nand another 40% are children. Support to the bags and soum levels will \nbenefit  women  greatly.  Aimag  hospitals  will  be  strengthened  to  provide \nquality services to referral cases of pregnant women and children.  \n\nThrough  civil  works  and  equipment  provision,  HSDP2  will  improve \nworking  conditions  in  rural  facilities,  where  most  health  workers  are \nwomen.  \n\nHSDP2 will train PHC  rural health workers, most of whom are women, to \nprovide efficient outreach services to achieve MDGs.    \n\n \n(ii) \n\nInstitutional capacity development  \n\nHSDP2 will provide a refresher course to all FGPs and  a basic course to \nnew FGPs. Training will include  provision of efficient outreach services to \nachieve MDGs.    \n\nHSDP2 will provide basic equipment and train FGPs,  most of whom are \nwomen.   \n\nThe  FGP  monitoring  system  will  be  strengthened  to  assess  the \nsatisfaction level of the poor and women.  \n\nHSDP2  will  increase  MOH  and  local  government  capacity  in  planning  a \nhealth system, and services that are efficient, effective, sustainable, and \nresponsive to diverse needs of different client groups, including  the poor, \nwomen, men at health risk, and children. \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\na. \n\nb. \n\n \nc. \n\n \nd. \n\n \n\n(iii) \n \n\nProject management  \n \nData for  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will be gender \ndisaggregated. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n14. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThrough the gender plan, HSDP2 aims to accomplish the following: \n\nApproximately  120,000  women  of  reproductive  age,  living  in  five  HSDP2  rural \naimags, will have improved access to quality reproductive health services. \n\nApproximately  200,000  women  living  in  five  HSDP2  rural  aimags  will  be \nencouraged  to  promote  their  health  and  adopt  health-seeking  behavior  for \nthemselves and their families.    \n\n(iii)  More than 7,000 urban and rural women PHC workers will be trained . \n\n(iv)  Working  conditions  will improve  in rural  facilities  in  five  HSDP2  rural  aimags, \n\nwhere most health workers are women.   \n\nEthnic Minority Assessment \n\n \n15. \nADB will work with the Government to ensure that the gender plan is implemented and \nwill contribute to achieving the MDGs. Progress of the gender plan will be included in  quarterly \nprogress reports.  \n \nD. \n \n16.  Most Mongolians are Khalkh  (81.5%). More than 30 ethnic and minority groups account \nfor  18.2%  of  the  population.  Ethnic  minority  groups  are  concentrated  in  three  aimags\u2014\nBayanolgiy, Urs, and Khovd.  \n \n17. \nTable A13.1 shows ethnic minority groups in HSDP2 aimags. Substantial ethnic minority \npopulations  exist  in  Dornod  and  Hentiy,  while  in  other  HSDP2  aimags,  minority  group \npopulations are very small.     \n \n18. \nNo data are available on health status by ethnic minority group. However, information is \navailable  on  literacy  and  education  (Table  A13.2).  No  significant  difference  is  noticed  among \nethnic  minorities  in  education  opportunities.  The  Constitution  indicates  that  no  person  will  be \ndiscriminated against based on ethnic origin, and guarantees equal access to education among \nethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities may thus be assumed  not to be disadvantaged in access to \nhealth services, and health status.   \n \nNo specific information is collected on occupation by ethnic group. In 2000, 47% of the \n19. \npopulation  depended  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood.  Ethnic  groups  have  lived  in  the  same \nplace  for  centuries\u2014highly  concentrated  in  Bayanolgiy,  Urs,  and  Hovd\u2014with  no  significant \nchanges in their lifestyle. Ethnic groups participate in community activities with equal rights as \nthe  rest  of  the  population.  All  the  population  speaks  Mongolian,  but  in  Khazakh  the  ethnic \nminority  speaks  its  own  language  and,  in  accordance  with  article  8  of  the  Constitution,  this \nnational  minority  is  allowed  to  use  its  native  language  in  education,  communication,  and  the \npursuit of cultural artistic and scientific activities.   \n \n20. \npeople\u2019s development plan or special actions in favor of any particular group are needed. \n \n \n \n \n\nGiven  the  equal  levels  of  social  indicators  among  ethnic  minorities,  no  indigenous \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nTable A13.1.

The  real  rate  of  return  is  likely  to  be  higher  as  healthy  workers  are  more \nproductive and earn higher wages than unhealthy workers. These benefits exclude externalities \nthat accrue to HSDP2. The economic rate of return analysis covers 20 years (2003\u20132022), and \nis  carried  out  in  constant  2002  US  dollar  prices,  with  domestic  prices  used  as  numeraire. \nEconomic  costs  were  calculated  based  on  the  annual  project  cost  disbursements,  and \nincremental recurrent costs estimated at about 0.5%1 of capital costs. Tradable goods of capital \nand operations and maintenance costs were adjusted based on a shadow exchange rate factor \nof  1.1.2  Tradable  goods  are  about  30%  of  project  costs.  Table  A14.1  shows  the  estimated \neconomic rate of retu9rn for HSDP2.

HSDP2  will  also  rehabilitate  and  rebuild health centers and \nhospitals  by  downsizing  facilities  and  improving  energy  efficiency.

About  400,000  people  in  the  five  aimags  will  directly  benefit  from \nHSDP2 interventions. The support to rural primary health in HSDP2 aimags will play a key role \nin decreasing maternal mortality and general morbidity. Health and poverty indicators in HSDP2 \naimags  are  worse  than  the  national  average.  These  aimags  also  have  poor  services.  As \nelsewhere  in  Mongolia,  inpatient  admission  is  about  20%.  The  average  visits/person/year  in \nmost  HSDP2  aimags  (2.5)  is   lower  than  the  national  average  (4.6).  The  high  use  of  inpatient \n(curative)  compared  to  outpatient  services  is  prevalent  as  indicated  by  high  utilization  of \nhospitals  (98%).  HSDP2  therefore  aims  to  provide  access  and  quality  at  primary  health  care \n(PHC),  thereby  freeing  capacities  at  the  secondary  and  tertiary  levels.  Based  on  international \nstandards on average length of stay, HSDP2 aimags have excess capacity of 2,200\u20133,000 beds \nper year.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nHSDP2  will  have  several  positive  impacts  on  the  population\u2019s  health  and  welfare  that \ncan  be  quantified  in  economic  terms.  HSDP2  is  expected  to  increase  the  number  of  persons \nreceiving  quality  health  care  and  will  contribute  directly  to  improving  the  productivity  of target \nbeneficiaries.  The  strengthening  of  these  facilities  will  have  an  important  health  and  social \nimpact  in  revitalizing  the  aimag  and  soum  centers.  Economic  benefits  will  potentially  include \nhigh  social  returns  from  the  investment  through  (i)  resource  cost  savings  and  (ii)  productivity \nbenefits from target beneficiaries.   \n \n4. \nCost savings consist of a reduction in private out-of-pocket expenses for health care as \na  result  of  (i)  increased  access  to  rural  health  services to reduce transport cost; (ii) improved \nhealth service delivery to reduce cost of treatment from public preventive health care in lieu of \nprivate  consultation/treatment;  and  (iii)  reforms  in  health  financing  to  reduce  cost  of  health \nservices, especially the poor. \n \n5. \nProductivity gains are the result of less time lost to illness, and increase in productivity of \nadults  and  children.  Improving  people\u2019s  health  will  lead  to  fewer  days  lost  from  illness  without \nthe health interventions improved by HSDP2. The base case assumes that benefits will accrue \nto  improved  productivity  due  to  efficient  treatment  and  easily  available  services.  In  the \ncalculation of benefits, the target population in the five aimags was used to calculate the number \nof  patients  that  will  benefit  from  HSDP2.  The  annual  number  of  patients  who  will  incur  cost \nsavings  and  productivity  gains  is  based  on  the  difference  between  health  incidence  with  and \nwithout HSDP2. The following describe the assumptions in more detail.  \n \n6. \nCost Savings.    These  are  the  annual  benefits  expected  as  a  result  of  savings  from \naverage  out-of-pocket  expenses  expected  to  be  incurred  had  the  patient  been  treated  at  a \nprivate  hospital  rather  than  at  a  public  health  center.  Benefits  are  calculated  based  on  $100 \nannual incremental costs that a patient will incur to go to a private facility, assuming four visits \nper  year,  at  $25  savings  per  visit  on  transport  and  co-payments. The number of patients who \nvisit  PHC  facilities  covered  by  HSDP2  are  estimated  based  on  the  population  of  each  aimag, \ntimes  the  health  incidence  related  to  infectious  diseases.  The  average  number  of  infectious \ndiseases  (per  10,000  people)  ranged  from  about  68  (Ovorhangay)  to  225  (Dornod)  (1996\u2013\n2000). The number of patients is equal to the aimag population times the number of infectious \ndisease/10,000 people times number of outpatient visits per year.   \n \n7. \nquantified based on the following:  \n\nProductivity.  This  is  the  expected  benefit  from  increased  earnings  or  inflows  and  is \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProductivity  benefits  from  HSDP2  will  result  from  increased  lifespan  due  to \nimproved  access  to  quality  health  care  covering  infectious  diseases.  HSDP2 \nbenefits are quantified based on the number of target beneficiaries (five aimags) \nmultiplied  by  the  potential  earnings  (minimum  income  level  of  MNT  22,500  in \n2002).  It  is  assumed  that  over  6,000  people  per  year  will  have  increased \nproductivity  due  to  HSDP2.  The  targeted  improvement  in  health  indicators of \ninfectious diseases is consistent with Ministry of Health (MOH) goals, based on \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) 2015.  \n\nProductivity  from  lives  saved  is  computed  based  on  the  number  of  lives  saved \nfrom  improved  maternal  mortality  rate  (MMR),  infant  mortality  rate  (IMR),  and \nunder-5  mortality  multiplied  by  the  average  annual  per  capita  income  of  $350. \nAccording  to  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  (2001),  each  life  year  is \nvalued at around three times annual earnings. Lives saved are thus assumed to \nbe equivalent to 3 years\u2019 earnings3 resulting from project interventions related to \nimproved  MMR,  IMR,  and  under-5  mortality  under  HSDP2.  The  targeted \nimprovement  in  MMR,  IMR,  and  under-5  mortality  is  based  on  HSDP2  targets, \nwhich are consistent with MOH goals and MDGs. From 1990 to 2007, MDGs are \nexpected to decrease MMR from 1.2 to 1.02, IMR from 63.4 to 26.8, and under-5 \nmortality  from  87.5  to  35.4.  The  improvements  in  these  health  indicators  were \nused  to  calculate  the  number  of  patients  that  will  have  increased  productivity \nunder HSDP2. \n\n \nThe base assumptions used for the economic analysis of benefits are presented in Table \n8. \nA14.2. Reasonable assumptions about the coverage and effect of the project have been made \non the cost-and-benefit streams.  \n \nSensitivity  Analysis.    Table  A14.3 presents the results of the alternative scenarios to \n9. \ntest  the  sensitivity  of  HSDP2  to  less  optimistic  assumptions. The  \u201cless cost savings\u201d  scenario \nassumes  that  HSDP2  is  not  successful  in  reducing  out-of-pocket  expenses.  Finally,  the  \u201clow \ncase\u201d  scenario  combines  \u201cless  cost  savings\u201d  and  \u201clower  productivity\u201d  from  lives  saved.  Even \nwith more pessimistic assumptions, HSDP2 has a positive return of 18%. \n\n                                                 \n3 J. Sachs and G.H. Brundtland. 2001.

Mongolia  made  impressive  gains  in  macroeconomic  adjustment  in  the  early  transition \nyears. However, during recent years, average growth rate has dropped and high unemployment \ncontinued. The growth in national income declined to 1.1% in 1990\u20132000. Mongolia\u2019s per capita \ngross domestic product (GDP) declined to $390 in 2001. Poverty remains high, and 36% of the \npopulation lives below the poverty line. \n \n11. \nThe declining economy has translated into a weakening public sector resource base for \nhealth. The transition to a market economy has resulted in a decline in public health expenditure \nas  a  percentage  of  GDP,  from  5.4%  in  1990  to  4.2%  in  2000.  Total  public  sector  health \nexpenditure was $39.5 million equivalent or only $17 per capita in 2000. This amounts to about \n4.2%  of  GDP,  or  about  10.5%  of  total  government  expenditures.  In  real  terms,  the  share  and \namount  for  health  have  declined  in  the  past  decade  but  trends  in  recent  years  have  indicated \nincreased  spending  in  the  health  sector.  Despite  this,  the  2003  health  budget  reflects  long \nstanding  weaknesses  in  the  health  sector,  including  an  oversized  tertiary  sector,  high  utility \ncosts, and inadequate capital investment. The budget also represents changes consistent with \nthe  new  sector  strategies,  including  greater  investment  in  rural  health  service,  and  expanding \nrole for health insurance and greater involvement of the private sector.  \n \n12. \nHSDP2 will address these weaknesses and support the proposed reforms. HSDP2 has \nbeen designed to minimize recurrent cost implications for the Government. The improvement of \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nhealth  service  delivery  systems  under  HSDP2  is  intended  to  reduce  wastage,  improve  the \ninternal  efficiency  of  health  service  delivery,  thus  reducing  the  cost  of  health  care  for  the \nindividual and society. The incremental recurrent costs of HSDP2 arise largely from increased \naccess to quality health care. Although new construction and renovation of health facilities are \nbeing  financed,  sustainability  is  being  ensured  by  the  prior  commitment  of  the  local \ngovernments  to  operate  and  maintain  the  premises.    FGP  recurrent  costs  are  expected  to  be \nfinanced through the health insurance fund and have, since 2000, comprised about 9% of public \nhealth expenditure.   \n \n13. \nThe financial sustainability analysis evaluates the impact of HSDP2 on the government \nbudget. The total financial cost of HSDP2, inclusive of taxes, duties, contingencies, and interest \ncharges, is $17.5 million for around 5 years. The Government\u2019s annual share in HSDP2 costs \nwill  average  around  $680,000  equivalent,  or  about  1.1%  of  the  health  sector  average  annual \nbudget  of  about  $53.9  million  annually.  The  recurrent  costs  to  be  borne  by  the  Government \nduring HSDP2 are estimated to be about $590,000 million per year and include (i) the operating \nexpenses  of  the  project  implementation  unit,  and  Directorate  for  Medical  Services;  and  (ii) \noperational,  maintenance,  and  replacement  costs  of  new  and  renovated  health  facilities  and \nequipment  under  HSDP2.  FGPs  under  HSDP2  will  continue  to  be  funded  by  the  Government \nduring  and  after  HSDP2  implementation.  The  budgetary  impact  of  the  estimated  annual \nrecurrent costs during and after HSDP2 implementation is considered minimal.   \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 May 2003) \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  MNT1,135 \n", "Currency Unit \nMNT1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "togrog (MNT)  \n$0.0009 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \ncareer development support unit \nDirectorate for Medical Services \nfamily group practice \ngross domestic product \nHealth Insurance Fund \nhealth management information system \nHealth Sector Development Program \ninformation and communication technology \ninfant mortality rate  \nmaternal and child health \nMillennium Development Goal \nmaternal mortality rate  \nMinistry of Finance and Economy \nMinistry of Health \nMinistry of Nature and Environment \nMinistry of Social Welfare and Labor \nprimary health care \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance monitoring and evaluation system \nPublic Sector Finance Management Law \nquality-and-cost-based selection method \nstatement of expenditure \nState Social Insurance General Office \nWorld Health Organization \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "ADB \nCDSU \nDMS \nFGP \nGDP \nHIF \nHMIS \nHSDP \nICT \nIMR \nMCH \nMDG \nMMR \nMOFE \nMOH \nMONE \nMSWL \nPHC \nPIU \nPPMES \nPSFML \nQCBS \nSOE \nSSIGO \nWHO \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Aimag hospital \n", "Soum health  center  \u2013 \n", "Bag \nFeldsher \n", "First referral hospital for the population of the province (aimag). \nTertiary-level services are generally provided in Ulaanbaatar. \nThe  center  that  provides  primary-level care services to district \npopulation, including migratory populations. \nSmallest rural administrative unit  \nCommunity-based health nurses \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", " \n \n", " \nNOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of T.
