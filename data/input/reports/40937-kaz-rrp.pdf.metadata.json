The \ncountry  has  benefited  recently  from  higher  oil  prices  and  greater  exports,  both  of  which  have \nincreased  foreign  currency  inflow  and  assisted  debt-servicing  efforts.  For  these  economic \nstrengths,  Kazakhstan  is  rated  Baa1  by  Moody\u2019s  and  BBB  by  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s,  with  a \npositive/stable outlook. Appendix 1 provides details on the country\u2019s macroeconomic outlook. \n \nNevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \n3. \nthe  economy  given  potential  volatility  in  the  international  oil  market.  Small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) and manufacturing are currently underrepresented in the national economy.1 \nBecause, the SME sector is relatively more labor-intensive, providing approximately 40% of total \nemployment,  SME  growth  is  significantly  more  inclusive  and  pro-poor  in  nature.  Therefore \ncreating conditions for growth of the SME sector is of key importance. In striving to diversify the \neconomy,  especially  by  developing  the  SME  sector,2 the  Government  has  a  declared  policy  of \nfostering  SME  development  by  promulgating  SME  laws 3  and  establishing  organizations  to \nimplement this policy.4  \n \n4. \nSME  development  is  hampered  by  the  difficulty  in  accessing  capital,  especially  debt \nfinancing, at sustainable market rates; and the lack of confidence of SME entrepreneurs in the \nbanking subsector, which is still burdened with an image created during the Soviet time. In an \neconomy where access to capital is constrained and banks have a legacy problem of attracting \ncustomers,  as  they  are  not  seen  as  reliable  funding  sources,  serious  negative  consequences \ncan  arise.  These  hurdles  must  be  overcome  if  Kazakhstan  wants  to  move  out  of  its  heavy \ndependence on oil exports and to develop the SME segment, especially manufacturing. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The SME sector is estimated to have contributed only 14%\u201315% of GDP in 2005. \n2  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Kazakhstan. Manila, 17. \n3  Law on State Support to Development of Small Business in the Republic of Kazakhstan. \n4\n  The policy includes various support measures, provision of services via business development centers, and small \nbusiness  loans.  An  exhibition  and  information  center  (a  wholly  state-owned  joint-stock  company)  works  in \naccordance with the Government's program to support SMEs. In addition, the Government set up the SME Support \nFund  in  1997  as  a  nonbanking  financial  institution.  The  fund\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  effectively  use  financial \nresources  allocated  within  the  framework  of  state  and  regional  programs  for  projects  and  activities  aimed  at \nsupporting  SMEs.  The  fund  is  tasked  to  (i)  broaden  access  to  finance  for  SMEs,  (ii)  effectively  use  state  and \nnonstate resources aimed at SME support, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide consultations for SMEs. \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nBanking and Capital Markets in Kazakhstan \n\n5. \nImprovements  in  the  economic  and  operating  environment  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  financial \nsector  have  resulted  in  rapid  growth  during  the  past  5  years,  leading  to  enhanced \ncreditworthiness  and  commercial  profiles  for  domestic  banking.  In  particular,  the  Government \nand  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan,  the  central  bank,  have  undertaken  structural  reforms  to \npromote consolidation and improve the overall viability of the banking system. \n \nEncouraged by this improving macroeconomic environment and robust growth, Kazakh \n6. \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year (albeit from a \nvery  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and  profitability.  This  is \nespecially  true  for  the  top  performers  within  the  first  two  tiers  of  the  banking  system.  Market \nobservers  expect  this  pace  of  growth  to  be  sustained  throughout  2006.  Appendices  2  and  3 \nprovide a more detailed analysis of the Kazakh banking system. \n \n7. \nOne of the key challenges facing the financial sector is the development of the nascent \n(debt and equity) capital markets, especially with respect to the corporate sector (Appendix 2). \nTo widen their access to funding, many banks are keen to enter the securitization markets. \n \nC. \n\nSecuritization: Overview \n\n1. \n\nThe Global Scenario  \n\n8. \nSecuritization has emerged as one of the dominant means of capital formation through-\nout the world, particularly in the United States (US) and Europe. Each year trillions of dollars of \nsecuritization transactions are structured by a wide range of entities such as financial institutions, \nautomobile  financiers,  leasing  companies,  credit  card  issuers,  infrastructure  and  insurance \ncompanies, governments, and local authorities. \n\n9. \nAsset-backed  securitization  is  a  highly  structured  financing  technique  that  provides  an \nentity  with  an  economical  means  of  financing  without  the  added  burden  of  increasing  debt \nand/or equity. In its simplest form, securitization is a process whereby the revenue stream of a \nsegregated pool of receivables or other income-producing (mostly financial) assets owned by an \noriginal  lender  or  commercial  enterprise  (originator)  is  repackaged  into  tradable  securities \nissued  to  investors.  The  receivables  are  sold  by  the  originator  to  a  specially  incorporated,  off-\nbalance sheet company or trust, known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV). In return, the SPV \nwill generally pay a purchase amount equal to the (par or net present) value of the receivables, \nwith limited recourse or no recourse against the originator for nonperformance of the underlying \ndebtors. Appendix 4 provides a general description of the securitization process. \n\nIn developed markets, asset securitization serves a number of purposes: (i) supporting \n10. \npublic  policy  objectives  such  as  broad  home  ownership  and  development  of  financial  markets \n(especially  capital,  retail,  and  mortgage  markets);  (ii)  addressing  regulatory  requirements  for \nfinancial  institutions,  especially  capital  adequacy  and  lending  limit  requirements  applicable  to \nbanks;  (iii)  transferring  risk,  especially  in  the  context  of  nonperforming  assets  and  portfolio \ndiversification; and (iv) providing an alternative means of raising finance. \n\n2. \n\nSecuritization in Asia \n\n11. \nAlthough securitization has gained wide acceptance in other parts of the world, it is still \nin its nascent stages in Asia. In the Republic of Korea, banks turned to securitization following a \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nstringent period of bank restructuring, adding an extra measure of liquidity. Elsewhere in Asia, \nsecuritization  is  still  not  being  regularly  accessed.  Issuance  of  asset-backed  securities  in  the \nregion has been dominated by Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, which account for \naround two thirds of overall issuance, followed by Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Singapore; and \nTaipei,China.  A  strong  argument  can  be  made  favoring  the  growth  of  asset  securitization  in \ncountries with developing capital markets. Many Asian countries are uniquely positioned to gain \nfrom the evolution of securitization in the region. \n \nFor Asian corporations, asset securitization provides a new and potentially cheaper form \n12. \nof  financing.  For  loan  originators  such  as  banks,  securitization  is  a  means  of  removing  assets \nfrom  the  balance  sheet,  while  retaining  most  of  the  economic  benefits  associated  with  the \nassets  and  of  freeing  up  capital  to  support  further  loan  underwriting,  while  better  matching \nassets and liabilities. For investors in Asia, including banks, unit trusts, and pension funds, the \nsecurities issued offer yields exceeding those on comparable corporate bonds, while providing \nan opportunity to diversify a fixed-income portfolio by adding another class of securities. \n\nSecuritization  is  already  proving  to  be  an  important  option  for  governments  seeking  to \n13. \npromote  private-sector  growth  and  employment,  and  to  access  funding  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  In  addition,  and  because  asset-backed  deals  are  usually  large  and  have  high \ncredit ratings, the securities tend to be liquid and may be actively traded in secondary markets. \nThis  promotes  capital  market  development  and  enhances  the  competitiveness  of  regional \nfinancial centers. Appendix 5 provides a more detailed overview of the various benefits derived \nfrom securitization. \n \nD. \n\nFuture Flow and Diversified Payment Rights Securitization \n\n1. \n\nFuture Flow Securitization \n\nFuture  flow  securitization  became  popular  in  emerging  markets  in  the  1990s  as  a \n14. \nmechanism to reduce sovereign-related risk and provide more attractive access to international \ncapital  markets  for  the  stronger  emerging  market  issuers.  A  future  flow  transaction  is  a \nsecuritization of a company\u2019s future and existing receivables that are due from offshore obligors. \nFuture  flow  securitizations  mitigate  many  of  the  sovereign  risks  associated  with  an  emerging \nmarket borrower by capturing cash flows offshore. Appendix 6 gives a more detailed description \nof the structure of future flow securitization transactions. \n \nThis securitization technique has grown in the emerging markets over the past 15 years, \n15. \nprimarily  in  response  to  the  search  for  lower  cost  funding  by  companies  that  generate  hard \ncurrency  flows.  While  many  of  these  issuers  historically  relied  upon  bank  debt  and  straight \ncapital-market  bond  debt,  the  volatility  and  risk  perception  within  emerging  markets  pushed \nthese  entities  toward  future  flow  securitizations.  Future  flow  investments  have  consistently \nproven themselves to investors, and over the years they have successfully mitigated a variety of \nthe  risks  associated  with  emerging  market  investments.  Of  all  future  flow  transactions \nworldwide, none has so far defaulted. Appendix 7 gives details of outstanding future flow asset-\nbacked securities deals. \n \n\n2. \n\nDiversified Payment Rights Securitization \n\nIn  a  diversified  payment  rights  (DPR)  securitization,  the  future  cash  flows  result  from \n16. \npayment  orders  or  electronic  messages  requested  by  offshore  obligors  instructing  a  bank  to \nmake a payment to a beneficiary other than the bank. This may take the form of payments to \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nlocal  exporters,  foreign  direct  investments,  tourism-related  payments  to  travel  agencies, \npersonal  wire  transfers  or  workers\u2019  remittances,  and  payments  to  local  service  providers. 5 \nAppendix 8 provides a brief overview and introduction to DPR securitizations. \n \nThe  first  major  securitization  deal  involving  migrant  remittances  occurred  in  1994  in \n17. \nMexico.  During  2000\u20132004,  a  total  of  $10.4  billion  was  raised  through  DPR  securitization  by \nBrazil, Turkey, El Salvador, Mexico, and Peru.6 2005 was the highest issuance year with close \nto $10 billion in total volume.7  \n \n18. \nTransactions completed since 2001 are listed in Table 1.  \n \n\nIn  Kazakhstan,  future  flow  DPR  transactions  are  only  beginning  to  be  introduced. \n\nTable 1: Future Flow Transactions from 2001 to 2005 \n\n \nProduct \nFuture flows \nFuture flows \n\n \n \nOriginator \nHalyk Savings Bank  \nJSC Kazkommertsbank \n\u2014 = not available. \na With credit enhancement.

ADB  promotes  the  Asian  Bond  Market  Initiative  inter  alia \nthrough the use of its guarantee products. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n5  Payments to banks relating to such payment orders are owned by the bank and not the named beneficiary. In other \nwords,  the  receiving  bank  does  not  act  as  a  trustee  of  these  funds  but  the  bank  is  performing  a  service  for  the \nsending bank, gets paid for doing so by the sending bank (and thus becomes the owner of these flows) and incurs \na matching obligation to the beneficiary. In this regard such payments are similar to deposits made into a deposit \naccount.  While  the  bank  will  have  an  obligation  to  pay  the  local  beneficiary  (recipient)  an  equivalent  amount  of \nmoney (in the stipulated currency), the bank does not have the obligation to deliver the exact same funds received \nfrom the sender (money is fungible). In other words, during the period from the receipt of the funds from the sender \nby the bank (from its foreign branch or correspondent bank) up to the stipulated delivery for the funds by the bank \nto  the  local  beneficiary,  the  bank  has  effective  title  to  these  funds  (similar  to  the  2-day  float  after  a  check  is \ndeposited). On a continuing basis, the average daily float can be calculated and made the basis of the amount of \nforeign currency received and then assigned to the SPV. From this perspective,  what the bank is assigning is its \nexpected float and not the remittances themselves that it expects to transact from foreign senders. \n\n6  Dilip  Ratha  (Senior  Economist  and  Lead  Author  of  Global  Economic  Prospects  2006:  Economic  Implications  of \n\nRemittances and Migration, World Bank, Washington D.C. 18 November 2005. \n7  Fitch Ratings. Future Flow Securitization Rating Methodology. 15 February 2006. \n8The Asian Bond Market Initiative was launched as a measure to prevent the recurrence of the Asian currency crisis \nby channeling  funds in the Asian region,  which is characterized by a high savings rate, to investments  within the \nregion. Currently, discussions are under way among the governments of ASEAN+3 countries on ways to develop \nand invigorate bond markets in Asian countries. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nB. \n\nFit to Country Strategy  \n\n20. \nIn view of the Government\u2019s medium-term targets for 2010, the development of a vibrant \nand  competitive  private  sector  is  vital  to  ensure  economic  diversification  as  well  as  balanced \nand inclusive development. The Government has a particular focus on SME development, and \non deepening and developing the financial sector. The ADB program, as set out in the private \nsector development section of the 2006\u20132008 country strategy and program update,9 seeks to \ncomplement  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  by  increasing  activities  in  private  sector  operations.10 \nPrivate sector operations will focus on the financial sector and capital markets.11 As a result, the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  update  (i)  emphasizes  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  SME \ndevelopment to create jobs and recommends ADB assistance by providing credit to SMEs via \ndomestic banks and (ii) identifies the need to deepen capital markets. \n \n21. \nThe proposed Guarantee directly responds to this country strategy by (i) providing a new \nstructure  of  funding,  and  in  the  process,  deepening  the  securitization  market  specifically  for \nmedium-sized financial institutions; and (ii) fostering financial intermediation for SMEs. Indirectly, \nthe  assistance  also  supports  rural  area  development,  as  ALB  is  providing  loans  to  SMEs  in \nthese areas.  \n \n22.  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  initiatives  are  part  of  a  wider  effort  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  the  financial  sector,  as  these  are  accompanied  by  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  to  enable  both  a  strong  financial  sector  and  reform  in  SME  finance.  ADB  has \nundertaken various projects to increase private sector development in Kazakhstan.12  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROJECT SPONSORS \n\nA. \n\nAlliance Bank JSC \n\n1. \n\nOverview and History \n\n23. \nALB  was  incorporated  in  1993  as  an  open  joint  stock  company  under  the  name \nIrtyshBusinessBank JSC. It merged with Semipalatinsk City Bank in 1999. The combined bank \nprimarily served large industrial enterprises in the Eastern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions. In \n2001, a consortium of domestic companies acquired a 37% interest in the bank, which in 2002 \nchanged  its  name  to  Alliance  Bank  and  relocated  its  headquarters  to  Almaty,  Kazakhstan\u2019s \nfinancial center. In 2004, ALB was reregistered as the joint stock company Alliance Bank JSC.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Kazakhstan.

Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Kazakhstan. Manila, p. 20. \n12  For  instance,  the  objectives  of  the  Urban  Small  Business  Development  technical  assistance  were  to  promote \ndevelopment  of  the  urban  SME  sector,  review  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  SMEs,  and  foster  financial \nintermediation  (ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  Preparing  the  Urban  Small \nBusiness  Development  Project.  Manila).  Most  recently,  the  Financial  Sector  Governance  Phase  II  technical \nassistance seeks to foster a sound, efficient, and broad financial system by strengthening the supervision of banks, \naccumulation  of  pension  funds,  and  operations  of  asset  management  companies  (ADB.  2005.  Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for Financial Sector Governance Phase II. Manila). This assistance will \nplay  a  central  role  in  supporting  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  financial  sector  and  in  strengthening \ndomestic banks.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAs  of  30  June  2006,  ALB  was  the  fourth  largest  commercial  bank  in  Kazakhstan  by \n24. \nreference to its assets of $4.4 billion, the fourth largest as measured by shareholders\u2019 equity of \n$282 million, and the fourth largest in terms of total time deposits (including retail deposits) of \n$1.05 billion.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Business \n\n25. \nALB  is  authorized  to  act  as  a commercial  bank  and  to  offer  a  wide  range  of  traditional \nbanking services, including deposit taking, lending, issuing letters of credit and guarantees, and \nothers.  ALB\u2019s  primary  business  consists  of  retail  and  corporate  banking.  Its  retail  banking \nactivities  include  lending  and  deposit  taking  as  well  as  providing  payment  cards.  Its  corporate \nbanking division provides a broad range of banking products to a diversified group of domestic \ncustomers, with particular focus on SMEs.  \n \n\nCurrently, ALB is rated by two rating agencies: Fitch IBCA (Fitch) and Moody\u2019s Investors \n\n3. \n\nCredit Ratings  \n\n26. \nService (Moody\u2019s) (Table 2). \n \n\nTable 2: Alliance Bank Credit Ratings \n\nFitch \n\nLong-term \nOutlook \nSource: Alliance Bank JSC. \n\nBB- \nStable \n\nLong-term \nOutlook \n\nMoody\u2019s \nBa2 \nPositive \n\n \nB. \n\nMerrill Lynch \n\n27.

The  entire \nissuance will consist of two series of notes, $100 million guaranteed by ADB (Series A) and up \nto  $100  million  unguaranteed  notes  (Series  B).    The  placement  of  the  Series  B  notes  will  be \ndependent on market demand. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nDPRs  usually  take  the  form  of  SWIFT 13  MT102,  103, 14  and  202  payment  order \n29. \nmessages. 15  These  payment  orders  are  generated  as  part  of  the  international  financial \noperations  of  ALB.  Payment  orders  are  created  as  a  result  of  ALB\u2019s  role  as  a  financial \nintermediary  between  foreign  payors  wishing  to  send  funds  to  Kazakhstan  and  residents  of \nKazakhstan  receiving  these  funds.  ALB  proposes  to  securitize  its  MT100  and  MT200  DPRs, \ndenominated in US dollars, euros, and (potentially) Russian rubles (ALB DPRs).  \n \n30. \nSimilar to the role of a traditional monoline insurer, ADB will provide credit enhancement \nto the investors in the notes in the form of a credit guarantee. ADB\u2019s Guarantee will cover timely \npayment  of  principal  and  interest  of  the  guaranteed  notes.  ADB  will  syndicate  part  of  this \nexposure.  \n \n31. \nthe proposed Guarantee.  \n\nThe recently disbursed $50 million loan to ALB will be used as the anchor investment of \n\nVI. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nJustification  \n\n32. \nADB\u2019s objective in the proposed transaction is (i) to develop Kazakhstan\u2019s securitization \nmarket to (a) diversify funding options; (b) procure access to longer term funds, specifically for \nmedium-sized private sector banks; and (c) attract a new set of investors; and (ii) to foster SME \nfinancing in Kazakhstan.  \n \nADB\u2019s proposed Guarantee will increase interest in DPR securitization from Kazakhstan. \n33. \nBy establishing a credit history for ALB, the proposed Project enhances its ability to raise funds \nin  international  capital  markets,  obtain  longer  tenor  funds  as  currently  possible  in  the  market, \nand build market confidence in medium-sized banks. ALB\u2019s business lines generating DPRs will \nbe under constant scrutiny by rating agencies forcing ALB to adopt and comply with best market \npractices.  For  the  investor,  the  proposed  transaction  will  provide  access  to  a  new  market; \ndiversify  its  portfolio;  and  presumably  receive  higher  returns  than  government,  bank,  and \ncorporate bonds. The transaction will boost investor and creditor confidence, both international \nand domestic, in Kazakhstan\u2019s banking system, and increase depositor confidence in the local \neconomy and banking system. \n \n34. \nADB\u2019s  second  objective  to  foster  SME  financing,  involves  helping  ALB  to  increase  its \nSME  loan  portfolio  by  providing  part  of  the  needed  debt  funding,  and  in  turn,  helping  the \nGovernment  in  its  efforts  to  steer  the  Kazakh  economy  toward  more  sustainable  SME-led \ngrowth  while  diversifying  away  from  the  dominance  and  dependence  on  natural  resources \nindustries. The Project allows ALB to extend the tenor of its borrowings to up to 7 years, 2 years \nlonger than the maximum tenor it has been able to obtain from the market. In turn ALB will be \n\n                                                 \n13  Society  for  Worldwide  Interbank  Financial  Telecommunications  (SWIFT)  is  an  international  messaging  system \nowned  and  maintained  by  the  member  banks  (payment  order  only,  no  settlement).  MT103/103+  are  sent  by  the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction.  \n\n14  MT102  is  principally  a  set  of  bulked  customer  transfers  that  meet  certain  criteria  (e.g.,  common  correspondent \nbanks, common currency or common value date). MT103 is a customer transfer wherein either the sending party or \nthe  payer  or  both  is  not  a  financial  institution.  MT103  is  a  more  structured  version.  MT202  relates  to  payment \norders from senders to payees that are financial institutions. \n\n15  MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto  payees  who  are  individuals,  companies  (other  than  financial  institutions),  or  governments  through  banks.  MT \n200  (including  MT202)  is  the  standard  message  type  for  payment  orders  relating  to  payment  from  senders  to \npayees that are financial institutions. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n\nable  to  lengthen  its  tenor  for  its  customers.  The  transaction  will  therefore  bridge  an  unwanted \nmaturity  gap  and  allow  ALB  to  match  its  assets  and  liabilities  more  closely.  In  addition,  the \nsecuritization will allow ALB to access lower cost funds, which will make ALB more competitive \nand allow it to pass savings to its customers.  \n \nB. \n \n35. \nThe  proposed  transaction  has  been  assigned  a  \u201cC\u201d  environmental  classification  and  a \n\u201cC\u201d with respect to indigenous people and resettlement. A desk review and onsite visit of ALB\u2019s \nDPR operations shows that these business activities have no anticipated adverse impact on the \nenvironment.  \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n\n \nALB has been advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy16 and policy relating to combating \n36. \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism.17 In connection with ADB\u2019s recent loan to ALB, \nALB  has  undertaken  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing  international  best  practice  standards  for  preventing  corruption,  money  laundering \nactivities, and the financing of terrorism. Further, ALB has undertaken to refrain from engaging \nin such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and ALB allows ADB to investigate any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. ALB is expected to give a similar covenant \nunder the insurance and indemnity agreement. \n \nALB will not be allowed to use the proceeds of the proposed transaction in any country \n37. \nidentified under (i) The Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, 50 U.S.C.A. of the United States of \nAmerica;  (ii)  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act,  50  U.S.C.A.  of  the  United \nStates  of  America;  (iii)  the  Uniting  and  Strengthening  America  by  Providing  Appropriate  Tools \nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), Pub.

Overall, the risks can be regarded as acceptable for a transaction of this kind.  \n \n\nADB conducted comprehensive due diligence to determine the viability of the proposed \n\nTransaction Risks \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n39. \nADB  will  enter  into  a  guarantee  agreement  and  other  required  investment  documents, \nfollowing approval of the proposed Guarantee by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These agreements \nwill be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n40. \nA framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto  its  lending  and  guarantee  operations  in  the  private  sector  is  in  effect  between  Kazakhstan \nand  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  ADB \nGuarantee. The Guarantee will not be made effective until ADB receives such confirmation. \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n17  ADB. 2003.

RECOMMENDATION \n\n41. \nI am satisfied that the proposed Guarantee would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof ADB and acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe Guarantee covering a principal amount of $100 million together with accrued \ninterest thereon in favor of the holders of notes with a maturity of 7 years backed \nby DPRs of ALB, on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board; and  \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  proposal  that  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  Project  exceed  the  single  project \nexposure limit. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President, Operations 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n15 September 2006 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nKAZAKHSTAN: MAJOR MACROECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nEconomic Outlook \n\n \nA. \n \nHigh oil prices, foreign investment, and good macroeconomic management underlie the \n1. \ncontinuing  economic  boom  in  this  oil-rich  export  economy.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth,  led  by  the  oil  subsector,  averaged  10.3%  per  annum  during  2001\u20132005.  GDP  growth \nreached  9.4%  in  2005  and  is  set  to  grow  to  $65.3  billion  in  2006  and  $84.8  billion  in  2008. \nFurthermore, representing 65% of GDP, the private sector is increasingly driving growth in the \neconomy.1  \n \n2. \nThese  factors  helped  lift  2005  general  budget  revenues  by  4.7  percentage  points  to \n28.2%  of  GDP.  This  large  gain  was  somewhat  offset  by  the  increase  in  budgetary  spending \nbefore the December presidential election. The general government budget recorded a surplus \nof 0.6% of GDP, from a slight deficit of 0.3% in 2004. In view of its strong financial position, the \nGovernment made early repayments totaling $850 million on its external public debt, reducing \nthe total to about 4% of GDP at end-2005. The 2006 state budget was approved in November \n2005. It raised revenues by 2% of the previous year\u2019s GDP, reflecting government projections \nfor  greater  receipts  from  oil.  The  increase  is  earmarked  for  public  investment  and  social \nprograms.2 \n \n3. \nHigh  world  commodity  prices  helped  boost  exports  by  40.0%  to  $28.7  billion;  oil  and \nmetals  accounted  for  more  than  two  thirds  of  the  increase.  Imports  also  increased  by  37%, \ndriven  largely  by  machinery,  equipment,  and  nonprecious  metals.  The  trade  surplus  improved \nby  about  45%  to  $9.8  billion,  but  the  deficit  on  the  services,  income,  and  transfers  account \nworsened  sharply.  The  latter  stemmed  from  greater  payments  for  construction,  freight, \ninsurance, and information technology services, as well as a near doubling of income payments \nto foreign direct investors, nearly all associated with oil sector development. Consequently, the \ncurrent  account  surplus  in  2005  improved  only  marginally  from  a  year  earlier  to  $750  million \n(about  1.3%  of  GDP).  For  the  first  time  in  5  years,  official  reserves  at  the  National  Bank  of \nKazakhstan (NBK) declined, although they recovered substantially in the first 2 months of 2006 \n(footnote 2). \n \n4. \nGross  official  reserves  stood  at  $7.1  billion  at  end-2005  (equivalent  to  37  months  of \nimports  of  goods  and  services);  while  year-end  foreign  asset  holdings of  the  National  Fund  of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, which saves a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral revenues \nfor future generations, amounted to $8.0 billion. During the year, the total of official reserves and \nfund  assets  strengthened  by  about  $684  million  (about  1.2%  of  GDP)  to  $15.1  billion. \nOutstanding public external debt was reduced by about $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion (about 4.2% of \nGDP) in the 9 months to end-September 2005. During this period, private sector external debt \n(excluding  oil  and  gas  intracompany  debt)  increased  sharply  by  $4.6  billion  to  $16.6  billion \n(about 33% of GDP). The upsurge in private debt in recent years\u2014mainly local bank borrowing \nfor  onlending\u2014was  largely  a  response  to  the  differential  between  available  foreign  borrowing \nrates and domestic lending rates of about 15% for tenge loans and 11% for loans denominated \nin foreign currency (footnote 2). \n \n\n                                                 \n1  European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development  and Merrill Lynch  estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in \n\n1998. \n\n2   ADB. 2006. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2006. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11\n\nThe tenge continued to appreciate against the dollar (2.9%) on an average annual basis, \n5. \nreflecting  export  earnings,  foreign  direct  investment,  and  private  external  borrowing.  However, \ntighter market conditions in the final months of 2005 resulted in a 2.2% depreciation on an end-\nof-year basis. As in the previous year, the real effective exchange rate rose by about 6% year-\non-year, due to inflation differentials. Largely because of future substantial oil-related revenues, \nreal appreciation may continue in 2006 (footnote 2).   \n \n6. \nThe  medium-term  outlook  is  positive,  assuming  buoyant  oil  prices,  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, continuation of economic diversification, good macroeconomic management, \nand  political  stability.  In  2006,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be  sustained  at  8.5%.  Moreover, \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  should  continue,  with  inflation  estimated  at  about  6.5%  in  2006. \nDespite  recent  substantial  increases  in  wages  and  social  spending,  the  Government  has \nmaintained  sustainable  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  which  have  limited  budget  deficits  and \ninflation.  General  government  debt  will  continue  to  decrease  in  the  next  few  years  by  about \n1.0%\u20131.5%  of  GDP  annually.  Additionally,  with  the  National  Reserve  Fund  for  excess  oil \nearnings and tax revenues expected to reach about $7.4 billion by year-end 2005, a substantial \nfiscal buffer has been created.3 Despite increased external borrowing by commercial banks, the \noverall external position remains strong. \n \n7. \nOverall growth during 2000\u20132004 was led by strong contributions from capital and total \nfactor productivity. The contribution of labor accumulation declined continuously, suggesting that \nthe  economy  is  likely  approaching  full  employment.  According  to  government  data,  the \ncontributions of capital accumulation, total factor productivity, and labor growth to the average \nGDP rate of expansion of 10.4% in 2000\u20132004 were 6%, 3.2%, and 1.2% (footnote 2, 98\u201399).  \n \n8. \nThe hydrocarbons sector has grown at an average of 16% a year since 2000, and will \nremain  the  engine  of  growth  in  the  medium  term.  Its  share  in  GDP,  including  production  and \nrelated services, jumped from 11% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2005, and is expected to continue \nrising  as  production  capacity  increases.  Sector  growth  has  been  fueled  by  large  capital \ninvestments;  oil  and  gas  have  received  60%  of  total  investment,  equivalent  to  15%  of  GDP \nduring 2000\u20132005. Two thirds of the oil and gas investment came from the private sector. The \nshare  of  hydrocarbons  in  GDP  will  increase  over  the  medium  term  as  large  projects  come \nonstream,  although  investment  in  the  sector  is  expected  to  taper  off  as  a  share  of  total  fixed \ninvestment (footnote 2). \n \n9. \nNon-oil output has risen at an average of 7% a year since 2000 and been sustained at \nthe  rate  of  25%  of  total  investment,  representing  6.5%  of  GDP  during  2000\u20132005.  Within  the \nnon-oil sector, construction and services have been the most dynamic. Their combined share in \nGDP and total employment has increased to 65% and 60% (footnote 2). \n \nIn  contrast, the  share  of  manufacturing  and  agriculture  in  GDP  has  declined,  reflecting \n10. \nlow capital investment. The investment rate stood at 3% of GDP a year on average during the \nperiod, with half of that from the public sector. If the investment rate in the non-oil sector keeps \nto its recent trend, non-oil growth could remain at 7%\u20138% a year in the medium term\u2014and even \nhigher  if  the  Government  manages  to  diversify  the  economy  and  stimulate  the  private  sector. \nRemoving impediments to regional trade and accession to the World Trade Organization would \nadvance development of both the non-oil and private sectors (footnote 2). \n \n\n                                                 \n3  The National Fund of Kazakhstan was created in 2001 to accumulate a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral \n\nrevenues for stabilization purposes and to save for future generations. \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nPolitical and Regional Background \n\nContinuing  growth,  job  creation  in  the  private  sector,  and  pro-poor  growth  have  raised \n11. \nliving standards. In 2004, real per capita incomes rose by 13%. The percentage of people living \nbelow  the  subsistence  minimum4 fell  from  19.8%  in  2003  to  15.0%  in  2004.  Unemployment \ndeclined from 8.8% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n \nB. \n \n12. \nKazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \ndissolution  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Since  then,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy to a market-oriented, democratic model. The transition was initially marked by political \nuncertainty and tension, a recessionary economy marked by high inflation and instability of the \nlocal currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \n13. \nSince 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program  of economic reform designed \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation; it \nis  more  advanced  in  this  respect  than  some  other  countries  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States. However, as with any transition economy, no assurance can be given that \nsuch reforms and other reforms described elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such \nreforms will achieve all or any of their intended aims. \n \n14. \nKazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor exports, including oil, steel, copper, ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminum, coal, lead, zinc, and \nwheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent upon good relations with its neighbors to ensure its ability \nto  export.  In  addition  to  taking  various  steps  to  promote  regional  economic  integration  among \nneighboring  countries,  Kazakhstan  signed  an  agreement  in  September  2003  with  Belarus, \nRussian Federation, and Ukraine to create a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin  common  economic  policies,  harmonization  of  legislation  implementing  such  policies,  and \ncreation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone is to \ncreate  a  free  customs  area  within  which  member  countries  would  enjoy  free  movement  of \ngoods, services, capital, and labor. Another step toward integration is that the member countries \nalso intend to look at ways to coordinate their fiscal policies, credit and currency policies, and \ngovernment  policies.  These  efforts  will  support  further  economic  integration  within  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access \nto export routes. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nSince Kazakhstan is heavily dependent upon export trade and commodity prices, it was \nparticularly affected by the Asian financial crisis in early 1998 and by the Russian crisis later that \nyear,  both  of  which  exacerbated  the  problems  associated  with  falling  commodity  prices. \nBecause Kazakhstan\u2019s economy is negatively affected by low commodity prices and economic \ninstability  elsewhere  in  the  world,  the  Government  has  promoted  economic  reform,  inward \nforeign  investment,  and  diversification  of  the  economy.  Notwithstanding  these  efforts,  low \ncommodity  prices  and  weak  demand  in  its  export  markets  may  adversely  affect  Kazakhstan\u2019s \neconomy in the future. \n\nMacroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n\n                                                 \n4  The subsistence minimum is a measure of poverty. Calculated by the State Statistics Agency, it comprises the cost \nof a basket of 70% food items and 30% goods and services. The poverty line is established as a fixed percentage \nof the subsistence minimum, and it is used for determining households\u2019 social assistance allowances and eligibility \nfor such assistance. In 2004, the subsistence minimum was T5,427 or equivalent to $40 a month. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13\n\n \n16. \nThe  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \nincluding a significant privatization program, promotion of high levels of foreign direct investment \n(particularly  in  the  oil  and  gas  sectors),  and  introduction  of  an  extensive  legal  framework. \nDespite uneven progress, Kazakhstan has experienced extensive economic transformation over \nthe  last  12  years.  Since  mid-1994,  the  Government  has  adhered  to  a  macroeconomic \nstabilization  program  aimed  at  curtailing  inflation,  reducing  the  fiscal  deficit,  and  boosting \ninternational  currency  reserves.  According  to  figures  compiled  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s  National \nStatistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following the adoption of a floating \nexchange rate policy in April 1999. It rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in 2002, 9.2% in 2003, and \n9.4%  in  2004.  However,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  GDP  will  continue  to  grow,  and  any \ndecrease  in  GDP  or  in  the  rate  of  GDP  growth  in  subsequent  years  could  adversely  affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s development. \n \n17. \nThe  tenge  is  convertible  for  current  account  transactions,  although  it  is  not  a  fully \nconvertible currency outside Kazakhstan. Between 1991, when Kazakhstan began its transition \nto a market-based economy, and April 1999, NBK maintained a managed exchange rate policy, \nwhich, although permitting the general trend in the exchange rate to reflect market conditions, \ninvolved  official  intervention  aimed  at  limiting  fluctuations.  Depressed  export  markets  in  1998 \nand  early  1999  caused  considerable  pressure  on  Kazakhstan\u2019s  managed  exchange  rate,  and \nresulting official intervention in the foreign exchange markets led to losses on foreign currency \nreserves.  In  response  to  these  pressures,  the  authorities  instituted  a  number  of  expenditure \ncuts,  took  revenue-increasing  measures,  and  in  April  1999,  NBK  floated  the  tenge.  The  tenge \nfell by 64.6% against the dollar as of 31 December 1999, compared to a depreciation of 10.7% \nas of 31 December 1998. Following the adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in 1999, the \ntenge continued to depreciate against the dollar, although at a much slower rate. It depreciated \nby 4.6% in 2000, 3.8% in 2001, and 3.3% in 2002. The tenge subsequently appreciated against \nthe dollar by 7.3% during 2003 and 9.9% during 2004. Then during the first 6 months of 2005, it \ndepreciated  against  the  dollar  by  4.0%,  to  T135.26  as  of  30  June  2005.  Since  then  the  tenge \nhas gradually appreciated against the dollar and as of 11 May 2006, NBK reported the official \nT/$ exchange rate as T122.87/$1. \n \n18.  While NBK has stated that it has no plans to resume a managed exchange rate policy, \nany  subsequent  decision  to  support  the  exchange  rate  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on \nKazakhstan\u2019s public finances and economy. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nNBK maintains a managed floating currency regime and does not set any official targets \nfor the tenge exchange rate. It uses interventions on the foreign exchange market as one of the \ntools  to  manage  systemic  liquidity.  Monetary  policy  implementation  is  complicated  by  strong \nprivate  capital  inflows,  rising  oil  earnings,  and  buoyant  domestic  demand.  M3  rose  49.2%  per \nannum on average during 2000\u20132004, and was up a further 50.2% in 2005. Cash in circulation \nexpanded 34% per annum on average during 2000\u20132004, and increased another 35% in 2005. \nThe  big  build-up  of  money  in  the  National  Reserve  Fund  ($8.2  billion, or  14.4%  of  GDP  as  of \nend-February  2006),  along  with  selling  short-term  notes  and  deposits,  has  assisted  partial \nsterilization  of  the  domestic  liquidity  produced  by  NBK  interventions.  Nevertheless,  the \nauthorities are worried about the rise in monetary pressure on the overall inflation process. With \nno  formal  target,  the  Government  aims  to  keep  annual  inflation  in  the  5%\u20137%  range  during \n2006\u20132008  to  ensure  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment,  while  in  February  2006  the \nconsumer  price  index  increased  to  8.7%.  During  the  next  2  years,  stronger  social  spending \n\nMonetary Policy \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nRegulation of the Banking Industry \n\nalong  with  further  tax  cuts  will  continue  to  put  upward  pressure  on  disposable  income  growth \nand consequently prices. Market observers therefore expect that with some easing of the tight \nfiscal  stance,  greater  exchange  rate  flexibility  will  be  allowed  to  keep  inflation  in  check.  NBK \nmight allow the tenge to appreciate in 2006-07 to restrain further price expansion. \n \nE. \n \n20. \nIn September 1995, NBK introduced strict prudential requirements for the operation and \ncapital  adequacy  of  banks.  In  addition,  an  institutional  development  plan  was  prepared  for \nleading Kazakhstan banks. According to the plan, banks are required to prepare their accounts \nin  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and  to  apply  the  Basel \nCommittee  norms  within  the  period  determined  by  NBK  on  a  case-to-case  basis.  Further, \nKazakhstan banks are required to join a bank-funded deposit insurance scheme and be audited \nannually by a public accountancy firm approved by NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading \ninternational  firms.  Following  legislative  changes  in  July  2003,  the  Financial  Markets \nSupervisory Agency was formed, and as of 1 January 2004, it took responsibility for most of the \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  functions  in  the  financial  sector,  which  had  previously  been \nperformed by NBK. The agency\u2019s main task is to regulate and supervise the financial markets \nand financial institutions in Kazakhstan. \n \nE. \n \n21. \nThe  need  for  substantial  investment  in  many  enterprises  has  driven  the  Government\u2019s \nprivatization  program.  The  program  has  excluded  certain  enterprises  deemed  strategically \nsignificant  by  the  Government,  although  major  privatizations  in  key  sectors  have  taken  place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational  telecommunication  company.  However,  a  need  remains  for  substantial  investment  in \nmany  sectors  of  the  Kazakhstan  economy  and  in  some  areas  economic  performance  in  the \nprivate sector is still constrained by inadequate business infrastructure. Furthermore, the extent \nof noncash transactions in the economy and the size of the shadow economy adversely affect \nimplementation  of  reforms  and  hamper  the  efficient  collection  of  taxes.  The  Government  has \nstated that it intends to address these problems by improving bankruptcy procedures, business \ninfrastructure,  and  tax  administration;  as  well  as  by  continuing  the  privatization  process. \nImplementation  of  these  measures  in  the  short  term  has  produced  few  positive  results,  and \nimproved results may not materialize until the medium term, if at all. \n \n \n \n\nImplementation of Market-Based Economic Reforms \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n15\n\nBANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS IN KAZAKHSTAN \n\n \n1. \nEncouraged  by  the  improving  macroeconomic  environment  and  robust  growth,  Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year in the last 5 \nyears  (albeit  from  a  very  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and \nprofitability. This is especially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking \nsystem.  Market  observers  expect  this  pace  of  growth  to  be  sustained  throughout  2006.  While \nfocusing mainly on the domestic market, some Kazakh banks are increasingly expanding their \noperations in other regional Commonwealth of Independent States countries, including Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  Russian  Federation,  and  Ukraine,  in  order  to  expand  and  diversify  their  businesses \nand market exposure. \n \nA. \n\nOverview of the Kazakh Banking Market \n\n2. \nThe  commercial  banks  in  Kazakhstan  can  be  divided  into  four  groups:  (i)  large  local \nbanks  (tier  I  banks), 1  such  as  Bank  TuranAlem  JSC  and  its  principal  competitors, \nKazkommertsbank  and  Halyk  Bank;  (ii)  banks  under  foreign  ownership,  such  as  ABN  AMRO \nBank  Kazakhstan,  HSBC  Bank  Kazakhstan,  and  Citibank  Kazakhstan;  (iii)  second  tier  (tier  II \nbanks)  medium-sized  banks  with  regional  operations;  and  (iv)  smaller  local  banks.  The \ndecrease in the number of banks from 184 in 1996 to the current 342 is primarily attributable to \nthe ongoing sector reform undertaken by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK).  \n \n3. \nThree  dominant  banks\u2014Bank  TuranAlem,  Halyk  Bank,  and  Kazkommertsbank\u2014\ncollectively represented 55.8% of total system assets and 50.7% of capital, as of 30 June 2006. \nEstablished  in  1990,  Kazkommertsbank  is  the  country\u2019s  largest  bank  in  terms  of  assets  and \nsecond  largest  as  measured  by  shareholders\u2019  equity.  It  had  total  assets  of  $9.85  billion  and \ncapital  of  $734.8  million  as  of  30  June  2006.  Bank  TuranAlem  is  the  second  largest  bank  in \nterms  of  assets  ($9.68  billion)  and  the  leading  bank  in  terms  of  capital  ($1.03  billion).  Halyk \nBank  is  the  third  largest  bank  in  terms  of  assets\u2014approximately  $6.44  billion.  In  the  past  few \nyears, however, the tier II banks have been increasingly taking more market share from the tier I \nbanks. In particular, the big three banks\u2019 collective market share declined from 62.3% in 2003 to \n55.8% as of 30 June 2006. This trend is expected to continue into the coming years.  \n \n4. \nBanking reform began in 1996 with the introduction of international prudential standards, \nincluding  requirements  on  capital  adequacy,  liquidity  ratios,  transparency  as  to  the  auditing  of \nbanks  by  local  and  international  auditors,  harmonization  of  local  accounting  practices  to \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards, and personnel training programs. In addition, NBK \nrequired commercial banks to adopt recapitalization and corporate enhancement plans with the \naim  of  boosting  their  abilities  to  attract  long-term,  private  investors.  In  2000,  guidelines  were \nestablished  for  bank  inspections  and  for  periodic  reporting  by  commercial  banks  to  NBK  (and \nnow  also  to  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency,  which  currently  is  the  banking \nsupervision  body  in  Kazakhstan).  In  2003,  all  banks  were  requested  to  develop  and  install \ninternal risk management systems. \n  \nAccording  to  published  financial  statements,  the  total  assets  of  the  banking  system \n5. \nincreased by 60% in 2004 and 68% in 2005, and as of 30 June 2006 amounted to $46.52 billion. \n                                                 \n1  Technically,  NBK  would  be  the  first  tier.  The  terminology  used  here  therefore  only  refers  to  commercial  banks \n\nbelow NBK. \n\n2  As  of  August  2005,  34  banks  were  operating  in  Kazakhstan,  excluding  NBK,  including  two  fully  state-owned \nspecial-purpose  banks  and  14  banks  under  foreign  ownership.  As  of  mid-2004,  27  foreign  banks  had \nrepresentative offices in the country. \n\n\f \n16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nDuring the same period, the total capital of the banking system increased by 46% in 2004 and \n63% in 2005, and as of 30 June 2006 amounted to approximately $4.6 billion (Table A2.1 and \nAppendix 3 provide details). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Structure of Banking Aggregate Liabilities  \n(as of 1 January 2006) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLiability \nClient deposits \nInterbank deposits \nLoans from the Government \nLoan from international financial organizations \nLoans from other banks and organizations performing \ncertain types of banking operations \nREPO transactions with securities \nSubordinated debt \nOutstanding securities \nOther creditors \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n(T billion) \n2,533 \n185 \n3 \n27 \n577 \n\n164 \n185 \n273 \n128 \n4,073 \n\n \n% of Total  \n62.2 \n4.5 \n0.1 \n0.7 \n14.2 \n\n4.0 \n4.5 \n6.7 \n3.1 \n100.0 \n\nREPO = repossessed. \nSource:  Agency  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  on  Regulation  and  Supervision  of  Financial  Market  and \nFinancial Organizations. \n\n \nB. \n\nCredit Standing of Commercial Banks \n\n11. \nThe financial standings of Kazakhstan\u2019s banks vary. As of 30 September 2005, 18 of the \n34 commercial banks had registered capital of over T2 billion, 15 banks had registered capital of \nover  T2  billion,  15  banks  had  share  capital  of  T1  billion  to  T2  billion,  and  one  bank  had \nregistered  capital  of  T500  million  to  T1  billion.  No  banks  have  registered  capital  of  less  than \nT500  million,  and  any  bank  whose  capital  falls  below  this  level  is  required  to  submit  an \napplication for voluntary reorganization into an entity performing only limited banking operations \nto the Financial Markets Supervisory Agency. As of 30 September 2005, aggregate provisions \nof Kazakh banks on overdue receivables were T52.5 billion. \n \n7. \nAs  of  31  December  2005,  all  of  the  commercial  banks  licensed  in  Kazakhstan  were  in \ncompliance with prudential regulatory requirements on capital adequacy, single borrower limits, \nliquidity ratios, foreign currency limits, and reserve requirements. As of 31 December 2004, two \ncommercial  banks  had  failed  to  comply  with  seven  prudential  regulatory  requirements, \ncompared to one noncompliant bank as of 31 December 2003 and one as of 31 December 2002 \n(Alliance Bank was not among these banks). The noncompliant banks did not meet any of the \ncurrent liquidity ratios, own capital ratios, single borrower exposure ratio, open currency position \nratio,  and  maximum  asset  investment  ratio.  Provisions  for  bad  debts  of  all  banks  operating  in \nthe Kazakhstan banking subsector as of 31 August 2005 totaled T52.5 billion. \n \nC. \n\nAccess to Funds \n\n8. \nTotal  liabilities  of  the  banking  system  increased  by  68.4%  to  T4,073  billion  as  of  1 \nJanuary 2006 (Table A2.1). The most significant impact was on client deposits, which increased \nby 56.5% to T2,533 billion and accounted for 62.2% of aggregate banking system liabilities. The \nincrease was attributed to a combination of economic growth and rise in population income. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n17\n\nOverview of Kazakh Capital Markets \n\nThe  lack  of  a  well-functioning  domestic  interbank  market  continues  to  hamper  the \n9. \nliquidity  management  of  banks.  Interbank  deposits  only  account  for  4.5%  of  the  aggregate \nbanking  system\u2019s  liabilities.  The  banks  are  therefore  turning  to  the  international  debt  capital \nmarkets  for  funding  enabled  by  the  improving  country  rating.  Access  to  the  international  loan \nmarkets by medium-sized banks has also improved. Several banks were able to raise financing \nfrom the international loan market. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThree types of government securities are available: T-bills, T-bonds, and inflation-linked \nbonds and variable bonds. Currently, only one T-bill is outstanding; it will mature on 30 March \n2006. Nineteen T-bonds are outstanding; they are typically 3\u20135 year debt, with the longest fixed-\nrate  bond  maturing  in  May  2010.  The  amount  outstanding  currently  stands  at  T56  billion,  or \n$430  million;  the  coupons  are  paid  semiannually.  The  five  consumer  price  index-linked  bonds \nare  valued  at  T  15  billion  ($115  million).  The  latest  consumer  price  index-linked  bond  was \nissued  in  April  2005,  has  the  largest  outstanding  amount  (T14  billion,  or  $110  million),  and \nmatures  in  2015.  Due  to  the  high  oil  revenues  and  a  cautious  fiscal  stance,  the  Government \ndoes not need to borrow in the local debt market. Due to the growth of the pension fund system \nin  Kazakhstan,  the  country  has  a  serious  shortage  of  good  domestic  long-term  investment \nassets  for  these  funds.  The  country\u2019s  bond  market  is  therefore  very  illiquid,  as  most  of  the \noutstanding issues are held by the local pension funds. \n \n7. \nTurnover  at  the  Kazakhstan  Stock  Exchange  increased  by  37%  in  2005  (Table  A2.2). \nHowever,  exchange  turnover  growth  has  been  concentrated  on  repurchase  transactions, \nprimarily on government securities. Turnover of the corporate sector only accounted for around \n3.4%  of  total  turnover  in  2005.  The  most  active  participants  in  the  exchange  (i.e.  buying  and \nselling  securities)  are  the  banks,  such  as  Bank  TuranAlem,  Kazkommertsbank,  ATF  Bank, \nEurasian Bank, and Alliance Bank. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Comparative Data on Kazakhstan Stock Exchange Turnover  \n($ million) \n\n \n2005 \nVolume \n12,044\n4,754\n1,040\n1,715\n60,848\n80,403\n\n \n2004 \nVolume \n9,449\n5,558\n977\n853\n42,012\n58,850\n\n \n2005 % \nof Total \n15.0\n5.9\n1.3\n2.1\n75.7\n100.0\n\n \n2004 % \nof Total \n16.1\n9.4\n1.7\n1.4\n71.4\n100.0\n\n \n \n \nMarket Sector \nForeign Exchange \nGovernment Securities \nCorporate Shares \nCorporate Bonds \nRepurchasea \nTotal \n \nYTD = year-to-date. \na Corporate and government securities. \nNote: Only deals of the primary market and purchase-sale deals on the secondary market, including state blocks of \nshares are considered in the sector of equities and corporate bonds.

This \naccounted for the underdeveloped status of the stock market.  \n \n9. \nThe corporate debt securities market of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange is represented \nby  176  bond  issues including  2  issues  by  nonresidents  (JP  Morgan,  Merrill  Lynch)  as  of  June \n2006.  The  financial  sector  remains  the  leader  in  terms  of  debt  issuance.  The  debt  securities \nmarket  capitalization  is  estimated  at  $10.4  billion,  which  is  63%  higher  than  in  2005.  It  is \ncharacterized  by  a  large  volume  of  consumer  price  index-linked  bonds  due  to  increasing \ninflation and an overall yield increase due to the rise in inflation and instruments supply.   \n \nDomestic  pension  funds  have  increasingly  emerged  as  important  investors  in  the  local \n10. \nbond  market  since  the  launch  of  pension  reform  in  1998.  The  steadily  accumulating  pension \nfunds  provide  a  supply  of  long-term  funds  that  is  lacking  in  most  emerging  markets,  including \nmany  other  former  Central  Asian  and  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  countries.  In  the \ncase  of  pension  fund  assets,  these  are  heavily  concentrated  from  a  portfolio  management \nperspective.  NBK  bills  and  corporate  bonds  account  for  34%  and  26%  of  total  assets, \nGovernment  bonds,  including  municipal  bonds,  account  for  19%  and  are  declining  as  the \nGovernment  seeks  to  reduce  its  domestic  burden.

This  is \ngenerally  accomplished  by  a  true  sale  of  the  assets  to  a  bankruptcy  remote  vehicle,  which \nfinances  the  purchase  through  the  issuance  of  bonds  backed  by  the  future  cash  flows  of  the \nasset pool. This achieves the outcome of creating a class of securities for which the underlying \nrisk is independent from that of the originating institution, and generally of a higher credit quality. \n \n2. \nSecuritization gained popularity as an asset class in the mid-1980s. By late 2004, it had \ngrown  to  represent  31%  of  the  $23  trillion  United  States  bond  market,  with  home  mortgages \nrepresenting the majority of the securitized assets. Although securitization in Europe took longer \nto establish, securitization issuance increased from $50 billion to $500 billion between 1998 and \n2003. \n \n3. \nIn  the  emerging  markets,  securitization  has  been  growing  quickly.  Initially,  most \ntransactions  involved  the  securitization  of  future  offshore  cash  flows  derived  from  exports  and \nremittances. Such structures, generally referred to as future flow transactions, are driven by the \nneed  for  borrowers  to  raise  relatively  cheap  cross-border  financing.  This  is  achieved  by \nmitigating  the  currency  transfer  risk  that  would  otherwise  be  present  in  their  corporate \nborrowings.  More  recently,  as  many  developing  countries  have  begun  adopting  the  legal  and \nregulatory reforms necessary for the domestic issuance of securitization, the bulk of activity has \nshifted  to  local  markets.  Although  future  flow  transactions  do  play  a  role  in  local  markets,  the \nsecuritization of existing assets has seen the largest growth. \n \n4. \nSecuritization  is  most  appropriate  for  a  company  that  is  seeking  balance  sheet \nmanagement,  or  a  company  with  a  specific  pool  of  assets  that  is  better  than  its  overall  credit \nquality. In principle, any assets pool with predictable cash flows can be securitized, even those \nthat are nonperforming, as long as the timing and amount of recovery is predictable. The most \ncommon  assets  for  securitization  include  mortgages,  credit  cards,  auto  and  consumer  loans, \ncorporate debt, export receivables, and offshore remittances. \n \nB. \n \nAt  the  center  of  a  securitization  is  a  special  purpose  vehicle  (SPV)  set  up  by  the \n5. \noriginator  of  the  financial  assets  to  be  securitized.  The  SPV  is  purchasing  the  financial  asset \nreceivables  (mortgages,  SME  loans,  etc.)  from  the  originator.  The  SPV  will  be  structured  to \ncontrol its income and expenses so that it will be \u201cbankruptcy remote.\u201d1 The SPV will fund the \npurchase  of  the  receivables  through  the  issue  of  debt  securities  to  investors,  which  will  be \nsecured on the receivables by virtue of a security interest granted to a security trustee acting for \nthe  investors  and  other  creditors.  The  originator  (or  an  associated  company)  may  continue  to \nact as the servicer in collecting and administering the receivables as an agent of the SPV, which \nin  turn  will  apply  the  income  from  the  receivables  to  make  payment  of  principal  and  interest \n\nStructure \n\n                                                 \n1  A key concern in securitization transactions is to ensure that the transfer of assets of the originator to the SPV is \nnot affected by bankruptcy or distress of the originator. This necessitates certain legal precautions in structuring the \nassignment  of  receivables,  and  also  constituting  the  SPV  that  it  can  neither  be  taken  to  liquidation  by  the \nshareholders of the originator, nor by those of the SPV itself. Further, the structure should also ensure that the SPV \nwould  not  be  treated  as  the  subset  of  the  originator  by  substantive  consolidation.  Such  a  structure  is  called \nbankruptcy remote structure. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n21\n\nunder  the  debt  securities  as  well  as  transaction  expenses.  A  standby  servicer  may  also  be \narranged in case the originator fails to perform its servicing obligations. Funds received by the \nSPV in excess of those required to pay investors are generally channeled back to the originator. \nThus,  securitization  enables  nontradable  assets  that  range  in  marketability,  credit-worthiness, \nand size to become liquid secondary instruments through repackaging and cash-flow structuring.  \n\n6. \nTo obtain the lowest all-in cost of financing for the asset originator, the risk inherent in \nthe  asset  pool  is  often  structured  to  create  two  or  more  layers  of  risk.  These  layers  are  often \nreferred to as tranches. Typically, the expected loss on the portfolio is identified and placed in a \njunior  (also  referred  to  as  equity)  tranche  that  is  retained  by  the  originator.  Requiring  the \noriginator  to  fully  absorb  the  initial  losses  helps  to  mitigate  the  moral  hazard  that  would \notherwise  be  present  if  one  entity  were  to  originate  the  portfolio,  but  not  have  a  stake  in  its \neventual performance. \n \n7. \nThe next tranche of risk is often referred to as mezzanine, which is generally structured \nto  absorb  losses  that  are  not  necessarily  expected,  but  that  may  reasonably  occur  if \nperformance  of  the  portfolio  is  much  worse  than  anticipated.  With  the  proper  amount  of \nsubordination,  derived  from  the  junior  and  mezzanine  tranches,  a  highly  rated  senior  tranche \ncan  then  be  structured  that  is  generally  deemed  to  comprise  relatively  little  risk.  If  adequately \nstructured,  this  senior  tranche  achieves  a  risk-reward  combination  sufficient  to  attract \ninstitutional investors. \n \n8. \nVarious  forms  of  credit  and  liquidity  enhancement  will  be  used  and  structured  into  the \ntransaction cash flow to ensure that payments on the debt securities issued to the investors are \nmade in full and on a timely basis. Consequently, the recourse of the investors is usually limited \nto  (i)  receivables,  (ii)  transaction  cash  flow,  and  (iii)  credit  enhancement  incorporated  in  the \nsecuritization  structure.  A  high  credit  rating  (usually  higher  than  that  of  the  originator)  on  the \ndebt  securities  and  therefore  cheaper  funding  can  be  obtained  by  reason  of  the  quality  of  the \nreceivables, the isolation of the receivables from the other risks of the originator\u2019s business (by \narranging a \u201ctrue\u201d sale of the receivables from the originator to the SPV) and the arrangements \nfor credit enhancement and liquidity support.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nBENEFITS OF SECURITIZATION1 \n\nA. \n\nHow Originators Benefit \n\nOriginators (the selling bank) gain from securitization by obtaining many of the benefits \n1. \nof  high-credit  quality  financing  without  retaining  the  debt  on  their  books  and  without  forgoing \nprofitable  aspects  of  the  assets,  including  origination,  servicing,  expansion  of  business,  and \nretention  of  excess  spread.  The  technique  for  determining  the  price  paid  can  be  complex  and \nmay require a significant initial investment of managerial and financial resources. Some relevant \nadvantages include the following: \n \n\nAssets  removed  from  the  balance  sheet.  If  structured  as  a  true  sale, \nsecuritization  can  allow  the  originator  to  reduce  its  assets  and  debt,  thereby \nincreasing  its  scope  for  borrowing.  Securitization  allows  a  bank  or  business  to \nachieve greater leverage. \n\nLower financing costs. Well-regarded pools of assets owned by a company or \nbank can be used to structure a security of higher credit quality, and therefore, of \nlower market cost than the corporate entity could issue itself. \n\nReduction  in  required  capital.  For  a  bank  or  finance  company  that  faces \nregulatory  capital  requirements,  a  securitization  transaction  that  qualifies  as  a \nsale  of  assets  for  bank  regulatory  purposes  reduces  the  need  for  equity \nfinancing. The latter may be costly and hard to obtain, and may dilute control. \n\nRecognition  of  gains  (or \nlosses).  Depending  on  accounting  rules,  a \nsecuritization  structured  as  a  sale  of  assets  may  allow  a  seller  to  recognize  an \naccounting  gain  (or  loss)  equal  in  the  aggregate  to  the  present  value  of  any \nexpected  future  cash  flows  payable  to  the  seller  that  will  be  derived  from  the \nassets. \n\n(v) \n\nAccess to an alternative source of finance and class of investors. \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nHow Investors Benefit  \n\n2. \nAsset-backed  securities  are  not  suitable  for  all  investors:  they  are  more  complex,  and \nthey may be less liquid than other debt securities. Nevertheless, many investors find that asset-\nbacked securities open up attractive new investment opportunities for the following reasons: \n\nSuperior return. The main benefit from the investor's viewpoint is a higher return \nor spread than is generally available on corporate or sovereign debt of a similar \nrating. \n\nLiquidity.  The  securitization  structure  offers  far  greater  liquidity  than  the \nindividual loans backing the transaction. \n\nDiversification.  Investors  gain  an  opportunity  to  diversify  their  portfolios  by \nparticipating in a different class of assets. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n1  Based on Giddy, Ian H. 2000. Asset Securitization In Asia. New York University  \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n23\n\n(iv)  Mitigation  of  event  risk.  Unlike  similar,  high-rated  corporate  bonds,  asset-\nbacked  securities  are  largely  immune  from  event  risk.  The  latter  results  from \ntakeovers, restructurings, and other events that effectively alter the credit status \nof senior unsecured corporate obligations. \n\n(v) \n\nCoping  with  constraints.  Many  institutional  investors  are  constrained  to \npurchase  only  investment  grade  securities,  and  some  are  limited  to  triple-A \npaper. Both requirements can be met in the securitization market.  \n\nHow the National Economy Benefits \n\n3. \nThe  effect  of  securitization  on  the  economies  of  different  countries  is  still  difficult  to \nassess  because  the  technique  is  in  its  infancy  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Nevertheless,  in \ncountries  such  as  Australia,  Canada,  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States,  where  a  high \nproportion  of  residential  mortgages  and  other  claims  have  been  securitized,  the  gains  to  the \nnational  economy  can  be  measured  in  the  billions  of  dollars.  In  the  United  States  alone,  for \nexample,  at  least  $1,600  billion  of  mortgage-  and  asset-backed  securities  are  outstanding. \nAccording  to  a  conservative  estimate,  securitization  in  the  United  States  reduces  the  annual \ncost  ($1,600  billion)  of  financing  for  homeowners  and  others  by  0.5%,  freeing  up  $8  billion  of \nresources each year.  \n \n4. \nintroduced in a transparent and orderly fashion, offers Asian countries additional gains from \n \n\nBut the case for securitization is actually even stronger than this. Asset securitization, if \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ncapital  market  development,  as  more  high-quality  securities  are  added  to  the \nfixed-income market; \n\na  source  of  funds  for  rapidly  growing,  capital-constrained  banks,  finance \ncompanies,  and  industrial  companies  whose  expansion  depends  on  the \nextension of credit to their customers; \n\nan expanded source of financing for residential home ownership and other asset \nclasses; and \n\nthe  potential  for  financing  infrastructure  projects  and  other  assets  that  produce \nreliable  revenue  streams  capable  of  being  contractually  assigned  to  a  separate \nlegal entity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nTHE MECHANICS OF FUTURE FLOW SECURITIZATION  \n\nIntroduction \n\nHistorical Volume Development \n\nA. \n \nThe types of assets securitized by future flow securitizations have varied over the years. \n1. \nThe most common flow being securitized previously stemmed from export receivables. Over the \npast  15  years  and  through  2005,  approximately  $54.2  billion  in  future  flow  export  receivables \ntransactions  have  occurred.  Since  2002,  financial  remittances  have  become  the  most  popular \nfuture  flow  asset  class,  with  $13.2  billion  of  remittances/diversified  payment  right  (DPR) \nsecuritizations.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nLatin  America  has  traditionally  been  the  strongest  originator  of  future  flow  receivables. \nIssuers such as Mexico\u2019s Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex), which in 1996 placed $6.0 billion, and \nVenezuela\u2019s  PDVSA  Finance  Ltd  placement  of  $3.4  billion  have  enhanced  Latin  America\u2019s \nvolume  over  the  years.  Until  2001,  Mexico  had  always  been  the  dominating  country  for  future \nflow  issuance.  Prior  to  the  upsurge in  volume  in  Turkey  in  2005,  Brazil had  taken  over  as  the \nprimary  source  for  future  flow  paper.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  countries\u2019  sovereign  ratings. \nMexican issuers, because they are domiciled in an investment-grade country, are less in need \nof  the  structural  protections  provided  by  future  flow.  Brazil  (and  Turkey  in  2005)  on  the  other \nhand,  which  has  been  rated  between  B  and  BB  since  2001,  is  a  market  where  future  flow  is \nuseful in mitigating sovereign-related risks and opens access to international capital markets for \nstrong companies.  \n \n3. \nWhile  Mexico,  Brazil,  and  Turkey  could  be  considered  the  historical  leaders,  other \ncountries  have  also  had  significant  amounts  of  issuance.  Argentina  has  produced  more  than \n$3.5 billion, although amounts have been limited since the 2001 financial crisis. Top banks from \nvarious Central American countries issued financial remittance future flows. Recently, Indonesia \nreturned  to  the  future  flow  market  with  $600  million  securitization  of  coal  exports.  Finally, \nEastern  Europe  and  the  Russian  Federation  have  shown  significant  potential  for  strong  future \nflow candidates. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nA  future  flow  transaction  securitizes  the  cash  flow  originating  from  a  specific  business \nline of a bank or company that produces goods or services for foreign customers. The structure \nof the future flow transaction is designed to collect cash flows in a dedicated offshore collection \naccount.  The  cash  flows  come  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  foreign  importers  making \npayments  on  receivables,  international  credit  card  companies  making  settlement  payments  to \nlocal banks, and international banks making remittance transfers to local banks. All cash flows \npass  through  the  offshore  collection  account,  and  the  excess  flows  are  returned  to  the \noriginating entity only after periodic debt-service payments are made.  \n \nThe  transaction\u2019s  structure  mitigates  many  sovereign  risks  by  keeping  the  cash  flow \n5. \noffshore  until  the  investors  are  paid.  If  certain  events  occur  (trigger  events),  the  structures \ntypically  trap  all  cash  flows  going  through  the  collection  account  to  accelerate  amortization  of \nthe notes. In some cases, only a portion of excess flows are captured during early amortization \nevents in order to avert a liquidity crisis for an issuer. Ratings of future flow transactions are tied \nto  the  credit  quality  of  the  originator,  which  is  typically  measured  by  its  local  currency  issuer \ndefault rating.  \n\nTransaction Mechanics \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n25\n\nIn some cases, a transaction\u2019s issuer default rating may be higher than the company\u2019s \n6. \nlocal currency issuer default rating thanks to the company\u2019s ability to continue operating beyond \na  general  default  and  generate  receivables  for  the  duration  of  the  deal.  The  going  concern \nassessment (Fitch methodology) and survivability assessment (Moody\u2019s) address these issues. \nAchieving  a  rating  at  this  level  is  a  twofold  concept.  The  company  must  not  only  continue  to \ngenerate these receivables by producing and delivering the product, but the collections from the \nreceivables  must  also  be  legally  protected  through  a  true  sale  structure.  In  some  cases, \ntransactions  are  rated  above  the  issuing  company\u2019s  local  currency  issuer  default  rating  but \nbelow the going concern/survivability level.  \n \n\nFigure A6: Typical Future Flow Transaction Structure \n\nReceivables \nPayment \n\nObligors \n\nTrust \n\n \nFuture \nProduct \n \n\nFuture \nReceivables \n\nCollections over \nPrincipal and \nInterest \n\nOriginator \n\nPrincipal and \nInterest \n\nInvestors \n\nOffshore \n\nLocal Country \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank analysis. \n\nD. \n\nFuture Flow Asset Classes \n\n7. \nThe two general types of future flow securitizations are (i) financial future flows backed \nby  banks\u2019  generation  of  hard  currency  flows,  and  (ii)  corporate-related  transactions  typically \ninvolving  export  receipts  of  some  description.  Financial  flows  include  credit  card  vouchers, \nelectronic  (typically  SWIFT-related  payments, 1  including  MT100s  and  MT200s 2 )  and  paper \nremittances. Corporate-related transactions typically involve airline ticket receivables; telephone \nnet settlements; and the most prevalent, export receivables transactions, which are backed by \nproducts  such  as  oil,  gas,  steel,  iron  ore,  soybean,  paper  and  pulp,  aluminum,  coffee,  and \nchemicals.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Society  for  Worldwide  Interbank  Financial  Telecommunications  (SWIFT)  is  an  international  messaging  system \nowned  and  maintained  by  the  member  banks  (payment  order  only,  no  settlement).  MT103/103+  are  sent  by  the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction. \n\n2   MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto  payees  who  are  individuals,  companies  (other  than  financial  institutions),  or  governments  through  banks.  MT \n200  (including  MT202)  is  the  standard  message  type  for  payment  orders  relating  to  payment  from  senders  to \npayees that are financial institutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nA  bank  or  company  based  in  an  emerging  market  securitizes  existing  and  future \n8. \nreceivables related to offshore cash flows (usually in a stable foreign currency) and receives the \nproceeds  of  the  debt  issuance  denominated  in  the  same  currency.  The  cash  flows  originate \nfrom a specific line of business in which the bank/company has demonstrated consistent strong \nperformance and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, or at least for the life of the \nstructured deal. In the majority of structures, the bank/company sells its rights to the future flow \nto an offshore special purpose vehicle, which transfers its rights to an offshore trust. The trust \nissues debt securities backed by future cash flows, and remits the sale proceeds to the special \npurpose vehicle, which in turn passes them back to the originating bank/company.  \n\n9. \nBecause note holders have access to payments on the receivables before they return to \nthe  country  in  which  the  issuer  is  located,  they  are  not  believed  to  be  directly  subject  to \nconvertibility  and  transfer  risks.  Thus,  the  ratings  of  these  transactions  are  not  strictly \nconstrained by the foreign currency rating of the host country (the sovereign ceiling). However, \nall sovereign risks are not mitigated by the structure, and transaction ratings are still constrained \nby certain inherent political and economic risks of an emerging-market country. These risks can \narise from such events as government instability, civil unrest, or natural disaster. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n27\n\nFUTURE FLOW SECURITIZATION VOLUMES \n \n \n \nFigure A7.1: Emerging Market Future Flow Issuance by Country/Region \n \n\nPeru, 778\n\nAfrica, 1,900\n\nRussia and Eastern \nEurope, 1,775\n\nTurkey, 11,149\n\nMexico, 18,377\n\nVenezuela, 3,349\n\nAsia, 4,926\n\nCentral America, \n2,020\n\nCarribean, 432\n\nArgentina, 3,560\n\nColombia, 1,492\n\nChile, 200\n\nBrazil, 11,628\n\nSource: Fitch.

The  SPV  transfers  its \nrights to the cash flows to an offshore trust, and then issues debt securities (notes) backed by \nthe future cash flows. The sale proceeds from the notes are then transferred from the SPV to \nthe originating bank.  \n \n2. \nThe  cash  flows  sold  are  typically  only  those  payments  received  from  correspondent \nbanks  located  in  highly  rated  countries  such  as  Europe  and  the  United  States.  The \ncorrespondent banks sign a notice and acknowledgment that commits them to sending all future \nreceivables to a trust account held by the SPV. This cash flow is then used to make scheduled \nprincipal  and  interest  payments  to  the  notes  investors;  any  excess  cash  is  returned  to  the \noriginator. Appendix 8 provides a graphic illustration of a DPR securitization. \n \n3. \nDPR securitization is recognized as an alternative source of long-term capital for banks. \nThe cost of funds is attractive compared to unsecured bonds. The notes usually receive a rating \nhigher than the host country\u2019s foreign currency sovereign rating since (i) the future receivables \nare due from offshore obligors, and (ii) the repayment is made directly by the SPV, which again \nis  located  offshore,  to  the  investor.  The  investment  grade  rating  makes  these  transactions \nattractive  to  a  wider  range  of  investors  such  as  insurance  companies  that  face  limitations  on \nbuying subinvestment grade. The sold receivables also form part of the assets of the SPV and \ntherefore, are not subject to claim of any other creditor in the event of bankruptcy. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 9 August 2006) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013 \n", "tenge (T) \n", "T1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0082  \n= \n=  T122.56 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAlliance Bank JSC \nCommonwealth of Independent States \ndesignated depository bank \ndiversified payment rights \ndebt service coverage ratio  \ngross domestic product \njoint stock company \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \nNational Bank of Kazakhstan \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nPrivate Sector Operations Department \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises \nspecial purpose vehicle \nSociety for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications \nUnited States  \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \nVice President \nDirector General \nOfficer-in-Charge \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", " \n", " \nL.
