The loan will \nensure  the  projects  are  ready  for  implementation  by  providing  funding  for  feasibility  studies, \ndetailed design preparation, procurement assistance, and safeguard implementation. The focus \nwill  be  on  priority  transport  corridors  identified  in  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional \nCooperation  (SAARC)  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study.1 Transport  corridors  linking  with \nthe Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) \ncountries2 \u2014such as the Asian Highway Network and the Trans-Asia Rail Network\u2014will also be \ntargeted. While the facility will cover 8% of Bangladesh's major roads and 12% of its railways, \ndevelopment  of  these  corridors  would  complete  the  subregional  land  transport  network,  which \nwill stimulate both subregional trade and the Bangladesh economy.  \n \n\nII.  \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nAlthough South Asia has been one of the fastest-growing economic regions in the world, \nintraregional  trade  accounts  for  only  about  5%  of  total  trade  in  the  region.  By  comparison, \nintraregional trade accounts for 26% of total trade in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN), 52% of total trade in North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries, and \n58%  of total trade  in  the  European  Union. The  South  Asian  Free Trade Area  is  slowly  getting \nimplemented while bilateral free trade agreements have also been demonstrating encouraging \nincrease  to  trade  volumes.  However,  investment  in  the  region  needs  to  be  accelerated, \nparticularly in less-developed areas such as Bangladesh. \n \n4. \nCountries  with  well-developed  and  integrated  transport  and  communications  systems \ntend to  attract more foreign direct  investment. Integrated  transport  systems  improve  access  to \nsubregional markets, making structural changes in their production capacities that can expand \nand  diversify  the  basket  of  goods  available  for  export.  This  is  essential  to  transforming  the \nfortunes of the smaller economies of South Asia. \n \n5. \nBangladesh  has  the  potential  to  become  a  transport  and  transshipment  center  for  the \nsubregion.  It  borders  India  and  Myanmar  and  is  geographically  close  to  Bhutan,  Nepal,  and \nKunming\u2014the key transportation hub in southwest People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). With the \nopening of the Bhangabandhu Bridge over the Jamuna River (the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge) \nand the proposed development of the Padma Bridge, the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong transport corridor \nand  other  strategic  transport  corridors  can  facilitate  trade  between  Bangladesh  and  the \nnortheastern  states  of  India,  the  Indian  state  of  West  Bengal,  Bhutan,  and  Nepal,  thereby \nattracting more foreign and domestic investment to the country. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   SAARC  Secretariat.  2007.  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study.  Kathmandu  (prepared  under  ADB.  2004. \n\nTechnical Assistance for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila [TA 6187-REG]). \n\n2  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand \n\n\fWhile overall trade in Bangladesh has increased since economic liberalization in 1980\u2019s \n6. \nand  its  acceleration  in  1990\u2019s,  exports to  East  Asia  (6.8%)  and  South  Asia  (1.6%)  continue  to \naccount  for  a  small  share  of  overall  trade.  A  2008  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  study3 \nidentified  weak  trade-related  infrastructure  and  poor  connectivity  are  one  of  the  more  serious \nimpediments  to  expansion  of  trade  and  investment  among  countries,  in  addition  to  a  narrow \nexport  base  and  few  complementarities  with  other  countries  in  the  region.  Another  study\u2014the \nBIMSTEC  Transport  Infrastructure  and  Logistics  Study4\u2014determined  that  improved  transport \ninfrastructure and improved access to modern transport systems are the keys to enhancing RCI \nin Bangladesh. \n \n7. \nBecause  of  its  location,  Bangladesh  plays  a  key  role  in  RCI.  The  SAARC  Regional \nMultimodal Transport Study identified priority corridors among SAARC countries. Six out of 10 \npriority  road  corridors  and  two  out  of  five  priority  rail  corridors  go  through  Bangladesh. \nBangladesh  also  has  two  of  the  priority  ports  (Chittagong  and  Mongla)  providing  international \ngateways  for  international  trade.  Bangladesh  requires  massive  investment  to  improve \ninfrastructure  along  these  priority  corridors.  Such  investment  would  not  only  contribute  to  the \ndevelopment  of  Bangladesh's  own  economy,  but  would  also  contribute  heavily  to  increasing \nsubregional trade. \n \n8. \nThe proposed technical assistance loan would focus the country\u2019s transport investment \neffectively  on  these  subregional  transport  infrastructure  projects  that  will  have  national  as  well \nas  subregional  economic  impacts.  To  promote  RCI,  these  subregional  transport  infrastructure \nprojects  need  to  be  ready  for  implementation.  The  proposed  loan  will  immediately  support \ngovernment initiatives to develop subregional projects in the wake of recent summits with India \nand  the  People's  Republic  of  China.  Indicative  follow-on  RCI  loans  in  transport  are  already \nenvisioned in the ADB\u2019s South Asia regional cooperation strategy,5 which is in line with priorities \noutlined  in  the  SAARC  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study  and  the  Transport  Infrastructure \nand Logistics Study undertaken by BIMSTEC. \n \n9. \nThe proposed facility will also address two key problems related to ADB's involvement in \ntransport  infrastructure  that  were  mentioned  in  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation  for \nBangladesh6 in  October  2009:  (i)  land  acquisition  and  procurement  delays,  and  (ii)  start-up \ndelays.  These  problems  were  caused  by  the  project  design  where  detailed  design,  usually \nfinanced by the loan itself, starts long after loan approval). One of the major recommendations \nof  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation  was  to  reduce  start-up  delays  by  ensuring  that \ntransport projects are ready for implementation shortly after loan approval. \n \n10. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  facility  will  be  to  increase  subregional  trade  among  South  Asian \ncountries,  especially  from,  to,  and  through  Bangladesh.  The  outcome  of  the  facility  will  be  to \nimprove  implementation  efficiency  of  RCI  land  transport  projects  and  promote  investments  to \nRCI projects by other development partners and the government. \n \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2009.

For the selected RCI road subprojects, \nthe  facility  will  provide:  (i)  a  feasibility  study,  if  required,  and  detailed  design;  (ii) safeguard \nimplementation  and  procurement support,  and  (iii) capacity  development support  to the  Roads \nand Highways Department (RHD) to enhance RHD operational efficiency and governance. The \nRCI  road  subprojects  selected  for  preparation  under  this  component  of  the  facility  shall  target \npriority  roads  that  have  substantial  RCI  impacts,  including  SAARC  road  corridors  identified  in \nthe SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study and Asian Highways network.7 Although most \nsubprojects  shall  be  those  already  identified,  should  any  replacement  or  supplemental \nsubprojects  be  proposed  for  inclusion  after  Board  approval,  these  may  be  considered  if  they \nsatisfy  agreed  criteria,  including  in  particular  the  requirement  that  they  have  substantial \nsubregional  implications.8   In  principle,  all  roads  will  be  designed  as  four-lane,  but  the  final \ndesign  will  depend  on  the  feasibility  study,  taking  into  account  engineering,  economic,  social, \nand  environmental  viability.  Consultants  will  also  explore  possible  private\u2013public  partnerships \nfor financially viable subprojects. Capacity development support will improve the RHD's internal \ncontrol  mechanisms,  asset  management  systems,  business  procedures,  and  human  resource \nmanagement. The facility aims to prepare at least 300 km for tendering in 2012, and an overall \napproximate length of 1,700 km by end of 2013. \n \nBangladesh Railway component. For selected RCI railway subprojects, the facility will \n13. \nprovide:  (i)  a  feasibility  study,  if  required,  and  detailed  design;  and  (ii)  support  for  safeguard \nimplementation  and  procurement.  The  RCI  railway  subprojects  selected  for  preparation  under \nthis component of the facility shall target priority railways (footnote 7) that have substantial RCI \nimpacts,  including  railways  along  SAARC  rail  corridors  identified  in  the  SAARC  Regional \nMultimodal  Transport  Study  and  Trans-Asian  Railways  network.  Although  most  subprojects \nshall  be  those  already  identified,  should  any  replacement  or  supplemental  subprojects  be \nproposed  for  inclusion  after  Board  approval,  these  may  be  considered  if  they  satisfy  agreed \ncriteria,  including  in  particular  the  requirement  that  they  have  substantial  subregional \nimplications.  (footnote  8).  The  final  design  will  depend  on  the  feasibility  study,  which  will  take \ninto  account  engineering,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  viability.  The  facility  aims  to \nprepare at least one project, or minimum 85 km, for tendering by the end of 2012, based on the \nfollowing  studies:  (i)  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design  for  two  railway  line  constructions,  (ii) \ndetailed  design  for  one  railway  line  construction,  and  (iii) feasibility  study  for  three  railway \nbridges and one signaling project. \n \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  to  prepare  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  design  for \n14. \nselected subprojects, as well as provide assistance with procurement. Safeguard consultants in \nthe  fields  of  resettlement,  social  aspects,  and  environment  will  also  be  engaged  to  (i)  provide \nsupport  on  safeguards  planning,  implementation,  and  capacity  development;  (ii)  facilitate \neffective  coordination  among  relevant  stakeholders;  and  (iii)  monitor  implementation  of \nsafeguard plans. Capacity development consultants will be engaged to work with RHD staff to \nupdate and utilize the financial management systems and asset management systems.9  \n \n\n                                                 \n7   List of Priority Subregional Road Projects (Appendix 2). \n8   Selection Criteria for Studies Under the Facility (Appendix 2). \n9   For  the  railway  subsector,  ADB  provides  support  to  capacity  development  under  the  ongoing  loan  (ADB.  2006. \nProposed Multitranche Financing Facility and Technical Assistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nfor  the  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program  [Loan  2317-BAN])  and  attached  technical  assistance  (Institutional \nSupport for Railway Reforms [TA 4847-BAN]). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n15. \nThe facility  is  projected  to  cost  $27.59  million,  including taxes  and  duties,  physical  and \nprice  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation  (Table  1).

The  government  will  retain  its  authority  for  contract  negotiation  and \ncontract  signing.  The  recent  summit  agreement  between  Bangladesh  and  India  requires  the \ngovernment  to  move  forward  on  significant  RCI  projects.  This  is  in  line  with  ADB's  long-term \nstrategy  to  promote  RCI.  To  further  accelerate  the  development  of  RCI  projects,  quality \nconsultants should be engaged in a timely manner.  \n \n\nIII.  \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  follow-on  transport  investments  prepared  under  the  proposed  facility  will  support \n19. \nBangladesh's economic growth and reduce poverty by connecting major markets in the country \nand providing communities with access to economic and social services. It will also contribute to \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  by  strengthening  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries \nand  increasing  trade  competitiveness  of  Bangladesh.  A  preliminary  study  on  transit  traffic \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nthrough  Bangladesh 11  estimates  that  the  improvement  of  Bangladeshi  sections  of  priority \nsubregional transport corridors could facilitate the movement of about 18 million tons of freight \nin Bhutan, India, and Nepal.   \n \nThe proposed facility will combine support for project feasibility studies, detailed design, \n20. \nprocurement, and safeguard implementation, ensuring that (i) follow-on investment projects will \nbe  implemented  without  delay,  (ii)  the  positive  impacts  of  follow-on  investment  projects  will \nmaterialize  without  delay,  and  (iii)  the  government  will  minimize  commitment  and  interest \ncharges arising under follow-on loans. The facility will help the government ensure the economic \nand financial viability of transport corridor projects with subregional impacts, and will mitigate the \nsocial and environmental risks of any follow-on projects. \n \nBy  providing  detailed  design,  procurement,  and  safeguard  implementation  support \n21. \nimmediately after the feasibility study, the proposed facility will accelerate the commencement of \nphysical works of the follow-on loans by at least 1 year compared with projects processed under \nconventional schemes. Currently, project executing agencies in Bangladesh can start recruiting \nconsultants only after the project loans have been approved. By contrast, the proposed facility \nwill  allow  executing  agencies  to  undertake  detailed  design  immediately  after  completion  of \nfeasibility studies. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nFinancial  management.  Both  the  RHD  and  Bangladesh  Railway  have  prior  and \nongoing  experience  with  implementing  ADB-funded  projects,  and  have  knowledge  of  project \nfinancial accounting methods and ADB disbursement procedures. For the proposed facility, one \naccountant  will  be  included  in  each  project  implementation  unit.  The  RHD  and  Bangladesh \nRailway  have  participated  in  workshops  run  by  ADB  consultants  on  good  practice  of  financial \nmanagement systems. \n \n23. \nThe RHD and Bangladesh Railway will establish and maintain separate project records \nand  accounts  to  identify  the  finances  received  and  expenditures  made  under  the  facility, \nensuring  an  adequate  audit  trail.  The  accounts  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound \naccounting  principles.  Independent  auditors,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  audit  the  accounts  and \nrelated financial statements annually.  \n \n24. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  ADB  will  select  the  consultants  and  the  executing  agencies  will  negotiate  and  contract \nwith the consultants thus selected (refer to para 18). This recruitment process will help to ensure \nthat consulting services are available in a timely manner. The procurement rules for selection of \ncontractors  required  by  international  financial  institutions  such  as  the  ADB  are  considered \nsufficiently robust to deter corruption at the bid selection stage. National procurement regulation \nhas  also  improved  recently  through  the  Public  Procurement  Act,  2006,  and  through  related \nPublic Procurement Rules (2008) with subsequent amendments. During implementation of the \nfacility,  reports  will  be  submitted  to  executing  agencies  and  ADB  in  line  with  submission \nmilestones to ensure the quality and timeliness of consultants' work. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. Bangladesh: Preliminary Draft Report on Estimate of Gains from Developing Functional Corridors for Transit \n\nTraffic through Bangladesh. Unpublished. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fSocial \n\nSafeguards \n\nimpact  assessments  or \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith the government and executing agencies (the RHD and Bangladesh Railway). The specific \npolicy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  set  out  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (footnote 10). \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  proposed  facility  will  ensure  development  of  environmentally  and  socially  viable \ninvestment  loans.  Because  the  facility  is  focused  on  project  preparation,  it  is  not  expected  to \nhave  any  adverse  social  and  environmental  consequences.  The  safeguard  categorization  for \nthe facility is \u201cC\u201d for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, respectively. \nFollow-on  projects  will  be  designed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009)  and government guidelines,  regulations, and  policies.  During the feasibility  studies,  the \nconsultants  will  prepare  environmental \ninitial  environmental \nexaminations,  as  applicable,  including  environmental  management  plans  for  the  selected \nsubprojects. Similarly, resettlement planning, indigenous peoples planning, and gender analysis \nwill be prepared for the selected subprojects during this stage. \n \nD. \n \nThe  facility  is  not  expected  to  have  any  impacts  on  gender  and  social  dimensions. \n27. \nFollow-on loans will be prepared in compliance with ADB's Handbook for Incorporation of Social \nDimensions in Projects and Handbook on Social Analysis.12 Gender, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other \nsocial risks related to follow-on loans will be assessed, and a mitigation plan will be prepared to \naddress those issues. \n \nE. \n \n28.  Major  risks  associated  with  implementing  the  facility  were  identified  and  practical \nmeasures  were  assessed  as  appropriate.  To  minimize  delay  in  mobilization  of  consultants, \nselection will be undertaken by ADB on behalf of the government. Emphasis is put on quality in \nthe  selection  process  and  the  contract  is  packaged  in  a  large  size  to  ensure  engagement  of \nquality consultants. For timely and quality report submission by consultants, executing agencies \nhave  set  up  teams  to  review  consultants'  reports.  Reports  will  also  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \nreview  and  quality  check.  Strong  internal  control  is  ensured  in  financial  management  by \nadopting a direct payment procedure. Progress payment will be made in line with the payment \nschedule after quality check by executing agencies and ADB. \n \n29. \nmitigating measures are summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 \n\nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.
