THE PROPOSAL \n  1\n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in, and a loan to, Bemobile Limited for the Bemobile Expansion Project. \n  A\np\n2.  Bemobile will use the proceeds of the equity investment and loan to (i) strengthen its  pe\nn\ntelecom backbone infrastructure and upgrade and expand its existing network in Papua New  d\nix\nGuinea (PNG), and (ii) continue the network roll-out in Solomon Islands to increase national   4\n \ngeographic and population coverage. The project will be the first private sector investment by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Solomon Islands.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n \n3.  ADB started discussions with Bemobile and its shareholders in September 2009. After \nseveral significant changes (i.e., the relaunch of the business in PNG in November 2009, \nexpansion into Solomon Islands in 2010, and management transition in the first half of 2010), \nthe business of Bemobile has shown positive signs of stabilization and improvement. The \nproject is in line with ADB\u2019s strategies and is selected for further processing to support its \noperation. \n \nB.  Sector Background  \n \n  1.  Papua New Guinea Telecom Market \n \n4.  PNG, with a population of about 6.7 million, is the largest economy in the Pacific region. \nBefore 2007, the telecom market in PNG was dominated by the state-owned enterprise, Telikom \nPNG, which had a history of insufficient investment. Telikom\u2019s services were among the most \nexpensive in the world. In addition, the country was among those having the poorest access to \ntelecom services in the world. The telecom market in PNG could be characterized as having (i) \nhigh demand for affordable services, (ii) widespread consumer dissatisfaction, and (iii) high \ntariffs and low telephony penetration. \n \n5.  Lack  of reliable fixed-line  infrastructure,  combined  with  reasonable  costs for mobile \nservice, has led to fixed-to-mobile substitution. Deregulation of the telecom industry is imminent \nacross the Pacific region. In 2002, the National Executive Council of PNG announced planned \nliberalization of the telecom sector, and in September 2006, Digicel PNG and GreenCom (an \nIndonesian-sponsored company) obtained licenses for mobile telecom operations in PNG, while \nTelikom was required to spin-off its mobile telecom business subsidiary. Subsequently, Capital \nWay, a special-purpose vehicle majority-owned by foreign interests, invested in 50% of the \nshares of the subsidiary, newly named Bemobile. Bemobile then relaunched its business in \nNovember 2009. Presently, the market is dominated by Digicel and, to a lesser extent, Bemobile. \nGreenCom has never launched and is the subject of liquidation proceedings.  \n \n6.  The mobile penetration rate in PNG is estimated to be about 28% as of December 2010, \nwhich indicates the market is still underserved.2 As a reference, the global mobile penetration \n                                                \n2  Lack of updated, reliable statistical data makes it difficult to accurately estimate the demand for mobile telecom \nservice in PNG and Solomon Islands, or in any specific province or city. The demand analysis focuses on the low \n ", "2   \nrate exceeded 60% at the beginning of 2009, and the mobile penetration rates in some other \nADB developing member countries in 2008 are as follows: Fiji Islands 71%, Indonesia 62%,   2\n \n \nKazakhstan 95%, the Philippines 75%, Samoa 69%, and Uzbekistan 47%.3       \n \nA\n  p\np\n7.  Demand growth will stem mainly from two groups: (i) potential customers who can afford  e\nn\nand  are  willing  to  own  mobile  phones  but  are  not  covered  by  any  mobile  network,  and  dix\n(ii) potential customers who currently do not have mobile phones but are already in an area with   4\n \nmobile coverage. Further demand is expected to emerge as the market takes shape, coverage \nexpands, and tariffs are reduced due to increasing competition. A demographic analysis based \non estimated data from the United Nations indicates that, in PNG, the 15\u201360 population age \ngroup is about 3.3 million. These are the mobile operators\u2019 main target clients and there are \ncurrently approximately only 1.8 million subscribers.  \n \n8.  In March 2009, the National Executive Council approved a comprehensive set of reforms \nfor the telecom sector. This sets out a path for staged introduction of open competition in PNG\u2019s \ntelecom sector. Subsequently, the National Information and Communications Technology Act, \n2009 came into force on the succession date of 29 October 2010. As part of the new licensing \nregime,  current  licensees  will  be  encouraged  to  migrate  to  the  new  set  of  licenses  on  a \nvoluntary basis within a year of the succession date. The act ensures that the new licenses will \nnot materially diminish the rights of the current licensees. \n \n9.  ADB, under a separate intervention, provided technical assistance to the competition \nregulator, the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC), to develop telecom \nindustry codes of practice and interconnection determinations. 4 The ICCC\u2019s information and \ncommunication technology licensing functions were transferred to the National Information and \nCommunications Technology Authority, which was established as an independent regulator. \nThe Papua New Guinea Radiocommunications and Telecommunications Technical Authority \nwas disbanded on the succession date of 29 October 2010. \n \n2.  Solomon Islands Telecom Market \n \n10.  Solomon Islands, with a population of about 540,000, has one of the fastest-growing \npopulations in the world. The country is made up of hundreds of coral atolls and small volcanic \nislands congregated to form an archipelago of nearly 1,000 islands stretching some 1,600 \nkilometers. These islands share a total landmass of 28,336 square kilometers, making Solomon \nIslands the second-largest country in the southern Pacific region. However, it is also one of the \npoorest  in  the  region,  with  per  capita  income  of  $1,256  as  of  2009.5 The  population  is \nfragmented into pockets of communities confined to islands distanced by sea and difficult terrain. \nMore than 80% of the population lives in small and widely dispersed rural settlements, mostly in \ncoastal areas (many of which are extremely remote). Communication between families and \nfriends in different parts of the country is a constant challenge, especially considering the lack of \ncoverage and prohibitive price of telecommunications. \n \n11.  Economic activity continues to rely on the unsustainable exploitation of the country\u2019s \nforests and high levels of donors\u2019 and development partners\u2019 assistance. The projected decline \n                                                                                                                                                       \nmobile penetration rate in PNG and Solomon Islands compared to other developing markets, which is indicative of \nstrong unmet demand.  \n3  World Bank. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nin logging from 2011 and any major reduction in aid flows will pose serious risks to medium-term \nmacroeconomic and fiscal stability. Currently, the most pressing issues for the country are \nsustained  economic  growth,  increased  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities, \naccess  to  basic  services,  and  improved  human  and  institutional  capacity.  Addressing  the \nmultiple root causes that led to social unrest during 1999\u20132003 also remains a top priority. \nImproved telecommunications could be a significant contributor to, and driver of, these activities. \n \n12.  Many telecom facilities were destroyed during the civil war in 2000 and consequently all \ndevelopment of telecom facilities was placed on hold. Solomon Islands is one of the least \n\u201cconnected\u201d countries in the world today. As of 2008, fixed line penetration was only 1.6%, while \nmobile penetration was 6.0%.6 Most areas of the country do not have access to any kind of \ncommunications infrastructure, including broadcast radio.  \n \n13.  The  telecom  sector  faces  a  number  of  challenges:  (i)  high  prices,  particularly  for \ninternational and internet services; (ii) limited coverage in and outside Honiara, the capital city; \n(iii) a limited range of products and services, especially for data; and (iv)a monopolistic market \nstructure, which has scope for improved operational efficiency.  \n \n14.  Restoration of telecommunications has only progressed slowly, and has been hampered \nby inadequate funding. In 2006, the government planned a review of the monopoly status of \nSolomon Telekom Company to introduce competition in the telecom sector. In 2007, the name \nof Solomon Telekom Company was changed to Our Telekom, which is now mainly providing \nglobal system for mobile communications (GSM) postpaid and prepaid mobile services in Auki, \nHoniara, Gizo, Munda, and Noro.  \n \n15.  Telecom tariffs, particularly for mobile and international calls, have been high relative to \nregional comparators and per capita incomes. Until recently, a 1-minute local mobile phone call \ncost around $0.40 (billed per minute), but in July 2009 this was halved at a stroke, indicating \npotential for further cost reductions and consequential uptake of services. High mobile telecom \nrates are reflected in the cost of SkypeOut calls to Solomon Islands which, at $1.17 per minute, \nare among the highest in the world. Broadband internet costs have declined slightly but are still \nvery high\u2014$100/month for an \u201centry level\u201d 128 kbps connection, $452 for 512 kbps, and $3,351 \nfor 2 Mbps (fastest). Public access to high-speed broadband internet is mainly limited to Honiara.  \n \n16.  The  government  initiated  the  process  of  developing  new  legislation  on \ntelecommunications and invited the shareholders of Our Telekom to renegotiate the terms of \ntheir exclusive license in late 2008. The negotiations concluded in June 2009 with the signing of \na settlement agreement to terminate the Our Telekom monopoly, phase in competition, and \ntransfer  regulatory  functions  such  as  spectrum  and  numbering  management  to  a  new \nindependent  regulator.  The  Telecommunications  Act,  2007  was  enacted  by  Parliament  on \n27 August 2009.  \n \n17.  Our Telekom\u2019s 15-year license is set to expire in 2017. The license is subject to review \nevery 5 years. The ownership structure of the company is as follows: 41.9% Cable and Wireless \n(UK),  7.1%  government,  and  51%  National  Provident  Fund.  The  government  launched  a \ncompetitive tender for a second mobile license in July 2009, and awarded Bemobile a 15-year \nnon-exclusive license in December 2009. It has been announced that a third mobile license \ncould be issued in 2011. \n \n                                                \n6  World Bank. 2010. The Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology. Washington, DC. \n ", "4   \n18.   In August 2010, Bemobile launched its operations in Solomon Islands, concentrating on \nHoniara, Malaita Province, and Western Province. It is generally expected that the benefits   4\n \n \n \nresulting from the introduction of mobile telephone competition in PNG provide an excellent    \n \nA\nexample of what could be expected in Solomon Islands. In PNG, such a change has led to a  p\np\nlarge increase in the use of mobile telephones and the Government of PNG estimates that it has  e\nn\nadded more than 2 percentage points to PNG\u2019s gross domestic product. It has also brought  dix\nmany more people into the cash economy, since they need to earn money to pay for mobile   4\n \ntelephone use, and farmers and fishers are using their phones to find the highest prices for their \nproducts. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n \n19.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure as one \nof  the  five  core  areas  where  ADB  will  employ  its  financial  and  institutional  resources  to \nmaximize results, efficiency, and impact.7 ADB will invest in infrastructure to improve transport \nand communication connectivity within and between its developing member countries. Under \nStrategy 2020, ADB\u2019s infrastructure operations emphasize private sector engagement.  \n \n20.  Under Strategy 2020, inclusive growth is one of three complementary strategic agendas \nupon which ADB will focus. The project will directly improve people\u2019s access to markets and \nbasic productive assets, thereby helping to achieve inclusive growth in PNG and Solomon \nIslands.  \n \n2.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n \n21.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 8 and its country partnership strategies \nin PNG9 and Solomon Islands.10 One key result area identified in ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach is \nimproved provision, operation, and maintenance of physical infrastructure so as to support an \nenvironment conducive to the private sector.11 Information and communication technology has \nalso been identified as one of the operational priorities. In the PNG country partnership strategy, \ninfrastructure is the focus of ADB and its private sector operations. In Solomon Islands, ADB's \nprivate sector development strategy aims to provide support to the government by improving the \nbusiness environment through greater private sector participation in different sectors of the \neconomy.   \n \n3.  Consistency with Other ADB Operations \n \n22.  In 2009, ADB provided financial assistance to Digicel, the other mobile operator in PNG, \nwhich was the first ADB private sector infrastructure investment in the Pacific region. 12 The \nproject is another ADB commitment in the telecom sector, showing ADB\u2019s continued effort to \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2008.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description \n \n1.  Project Design \n \n23.  Bemobile\u2019s existing networks in PNG and Solomon Islands are based on the global \nsystem  for  mobile  communications  (GSM),  the  most  popular  standard  for  mobile \ntelecommunications in the world. \n \n24.  Bemobile will add additional switches, upgrade its billing system, and expand its network \ncoverage. Most of the new network sites are in rural areas. The equipment, the cost of which \nrepresents less than 50% of the total capital expenditure, is expected to be purchased from \nforeign  suppliers.  However,  civil  works  and  other  services  have  been  contracted  to  local \ncontractors and suppliers, directly benefiting the local economy. In addition, system upgrades \nwill support the initial deployment of broadband data and new value-added services including \nmobile banking. \n \n2.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n \n25.  The project will result in improved and expanded mobile telecom network facilities, thus \nenabling  more  subscribers  to  afford  and  use  telecom  services  in  line  with  international \nstandards. The outcome of the project will be increased penetration of high-quality, affordable \nmobile telecom services in  PNG and the Solomon Islands.  \n \nB.  Development Impact \n \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n \n26.  Since its relaunch, Bemobile has substantially lowered mobile calling prices in PNG. \nCurrently the tariff of Bemobile is cheaper than the other mobile operators in PNG and Solomon \nIslands. Through project implementation, tariffs are expected to continuously decrease as the \nresult of enhanced economies of scale and increased competition. Bemobile will also be able to \nprovide more reliable services after its backbone is strengthened through the project. Hence, \nthe project will increase the affordability and reliability of telecom services, particularly for low-\nincome users, across PNG and Solomon Islands. The project will also expand the network \ncoverage in PNG and Solomon Islands, and the improved accessibility will most benefit users in \nrural, remote areas where telecom service is limited or nonexistent. The increased affordability \nand  improved  accessibility  will  enable  inclusive  economic  growth  by  facilitating  access  to \nmarkets and information, such as by providing remote access to bank accounts and updated \nmarket information for fishers and farmers. For example, buyers will be able to contact a fisher \nto place orders while he or she is fishing at sea.  \n \n27.  The project will significantly improve Bemobile\u2019s existing networks in PNG and Solomon \nIslands.  After  project  implementation,  customers  will  enjoy  better  access  to  information, \nincluding  in  relation  to  public  services,  education,  health,  and  security.  For  these  island \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance Report: Facilitating Public-Private Partnerships in Papua New Guinea. Manila \n ", "6   \ncountries, information such as weather forecasts or natural disaster alerts is critical to the \ngeneral public, particularly the poor. Following completion of the project, more villages that have   6\n \n \n \nroads but have not had telephones will be able to use ambulance services because villagers will    \n \nA\nbe able to call the services directly. Also, in the past a village school in a rural area might close  p\np\nfor several days just because the teacher needed to go to a bank to confirm a wage credit (and  e\nn\nthis took so long, due to the lack of transport infrastructure). With the short messaging system  dix\n(SMS) banking service provided by Bemobile and its partner banks, commuting time will be   4\n \nsaved.  A  mobile  banking  project  will  be  developed  associated  with  the  project  and,  upon \ncompletion, the people in PNG and Solomon Islands, particularly the poor, will have access to \nenhanced banking services. \n \n28.  The project supports the Government of PNG\u2019s Medium Term Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2015,18 which has a primary goal of building the foundation for increased economic growth and \nprosperity. It promotes investment and competition in key sectors that enable increased growth \nand  facilitate  efficient  government  expenditure.  Improved  access  to  information  and \ncommunication technology is highlighted as crucial in facilitating business and income-earning \nopportunities,  while  aiding  the  efficient  delivery  of  public  services,  including  health  and \neducation.  Recent  advances  in  the  outreach  of  mobile  telecom  services,  following  the \nintroduction of competition, are credited as having had major social and economic benefits, \nwhile investment in telecommunications has been one of the main drivers of economic growth in \n2005\u20132009. The plan further highlights the government\u2019s commitment to the continued reform \nand liberalization of the telecom sector. \n \n29.  The project is also consistent with the Government of Solomon Island\u2019s broad-ranging \nMedium Term Development Strategy, 2008\u20132010,19 which was adopted by the government in \n2008. Given the post-conflict nature of the country, the overarching goal of the strategy is post-\nconflict reconciliation. The strategy recognizes, however, that to achieve economic growth and \nprosperity,  Solomon  Islands  needs  to  create  an  environment  that  promotes  private  sector \nactivity.  In  particular,  the  strategy  highlights  improving  access  to,  and  affordability  of, \ntelecommunications as a priority. While the current strategy ended in 2010, a new national \nstrategic plan is under development with ADB assistance. The new plan is also likely to accord \na high priority to growth led by the private sector. \n \n2.  Private Sector Development \n \n30.  The  project  will  also  provide  direct  development,  employment,  and  business \nopportunities to staff, dealers, and contractors in underdeveloped areas of the countries. The \npartial privatization of Bemobile in 2008 was recognized as the most important event in recent \nprivate sector development in PNG, and the success of Bemobile has a direct impact on the \noverall development of the private sector in the country. Meanwhile, Bemobile\u2019s investment in \nSolomon Islands is also considered a major milestone in private sector development in that \ncountry. ADB\u2019s support to Bemobile in both countries will promote further participation of the \nprivate sector, which is playing an increasing role in economic growth in PNG and Solomon \nIslands. \n \n \n \n                                                \n18  Government of Papua New Guinea. 2010.

Environmental and Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Environmental Safeguards \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s environmental due diligence for the project has included a review of the potential \nenvironmental impacts related to the project\u2019s locations, planning and design, construction, and \noperation. These impacts are assessed to be either insignificant or temporary in nature. The \nproject is unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, the project is classified \nenvironment category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nproposed ADB assistance will finance improvement and expansion of existing facilities covering \nmultiple  sites.  An  environmental  and  social  compliance  audit  was  undertaken  to  assess \nBemobile\u2019s current environment and social management system and the company's past and \ncurrent  performance  against  the  objectives,  principles,  and  requirements  of  the  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. An initial environmental examination report was also prepared by Bemobile in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n2.  Social Dimensions \n \n32.  Installation of mobile base stations will require limited space for roof- or wall-mounted \nantennas or a small parcel of leased land. Depending on the type and height of towers, ground \nis cleared of vegetation at each site, providing sufficient space to store tower beams and other \ncomponents during construction and to establish a small temporary workforce camp.  \n \n33.  Social safeguards. The corporate environmental and social audit findings show that \nBemobile has adopted strict selection criteria in line with its Site Acquisition Process20 to avoid \ninvoluntary resettlement and adverse indigenous people impacts. For each telecom tower site, \nBemobile identifies several sites and follows strict selection criteria. \n \n34.  In PNG and Solomon Islands, the indigenous population is almost entirely Melanesian, \nalthough a small number of Polynesians reside north of Bougainville Island. There are estimated \nto be more than 1,000 cultural groups and around 840 indigenous languages in PNG due to \nfragmentation created by terrain. Significant ethnic distinctions exist between population groups \nin  different  parts  of  the  country  but,  despite  the  number  of  groups,  none  are  considered \nminorities. In Solomon Islands, minority groups include Polynesians and i-Kiribati. The central \nchain of high islands was historically occupied by Melanesians, while outlying islands (including \ncoral atolls) were occupied by different Polynesian cultural groups. The i-Kiribati resettled from \nthe  Gilbert  Islands  (Kiribati)  from  the  1950s  onward  due  to  land  shortages.  Around  80 \nMelanesian and five Polynesian languages are spoken.  \n \n35.  Bemobile\u2019s  Site  Acquisition  Process requires  that  only  sites  that  will  not  entail  any \nphysical or economic displacement of people or cause any adverse impacts on customary \nowners of land will be selected.  \n \n36.  The land requirements for the mobile base stations are minimal, and the selection \ncriteria adopted ensure that the project will entail no involuntary resettlement impacts. The site \nacquisition procedure is transparent and ensures that any customary owned lands are leased \nwith the consent of their owners. From the perspective of the Safeguard Policy Statement, the \nproject is classified category C under involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n                                                \n20 Bemobile. 2010. Site Acquisition Process. Port Moresby. \n ", "8   \n37.  Bemobile adopted a corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy in July 2009, which \ncovers  noncommercial  sponsorships,  donations,  community  service,  and  disaster  relief.   8\n \n \n \nBemobile\u2019s CSR program aims to benefit communities in PNG through improved education,    \n \nA\nhealth,  and  safety.  Through  its  CSR  policy,  Bemobile  not  only  plans  to  reach  out  to  the  p\np\ncommunity but it has also adopted a socially responsible commercial approach focusing more  e\nn\non building local capacity and promoting positive social values not only among its employees  dix\nbut also in the country. The same approach will be adopted in Solomon Islands.    4\n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Licenses and Permits \n \n38.  A  nationwide  GSM  mobile  license  and  spectrum  assignment  underpins  Bemobile\u2019s \noperation. In PNG, Telikom was issued a mobile carrier license by the Independent Consumer \nand Competition Commission (ICCC) under the Telecommunications Act, 1996 on 18 July 2002 \nfor a period of 15 years. Telikom assigned its rights under the mobile carrier license to Bemobile \nin 2008. Telikom was also a party to the spectrum usage agreement with the Papua New \nGuinea Radiocommunications and Telecommunications Technical Authority dated 15 October \n2007 that allows it to use spectrum in connection with the provision of the mobile carrier license. \nTelikom has also exclusively sublicensed its rights under the agreement to Bemobile. On 21 \nAugust 2009, Bemobile was granted a \u201ccarrier grade\u201d value-added services license by the ICCC \nfor a period of 15 years. In Solomon Islands, Bemobile was awarded a 15-year license in \nDecember 2009 along with spectrums. Together, the license and agreements give Bemobile a \nnonexclusive right to provide mobile voice and data services based on the GSM and WCDMA \n(3G) standards in PNG and Solomon Islands. \n \n2.  Interconnection \n \n39.  In PNG interconnection is mandated by the Telecommunications Act, 1996 and no \nsignificant change is expected under the National Information and Communications Technology \nAct. Bemobile is interconnected both domestically and internationally and maintains several \ninterconnection  agreements.  On  the  domestic  side  Bemobile  is  interconnected  with  both \nTelikom and Digicel.  \n \n40.  In Solomon Islands, Bemobile has signed an interconnection agreement with Solomon \nTelekom. \n \n3.  Construction Arrangements \n \n41.  The project will expand Bemobile\u2019s existing network It is expected that all the contractors \nand equipment suppliers are reputable and were involved in the works at the existing sites.  \n   \n42.  All  building  activities  during  planning,  site  survey,  site  acquisition,  construction, \ninstallation, transmission, and upgrades will be carried out simultaneously on a rolling schedule. \nBemobile is continuously engaged in, and has demonstrated ability in, planning and executing \nthe successful design and construction of this type of infrastructure.  \n \n4.  Operations Arrangements \n \n43.  Bemobile\u2019s business is highly automated, as is the standard in the mobile telecom \nindustry. For PNG, Bemobile has key equipment in the form of switches in its headquarters in \n ", "9 \nPort Moresby as well as base station controllers and/or media gateways in three key regional \ncities.  In  Solomon  Islands  all  key  equipment  is  located  in  Honiara.  All  base  stations  and \nassociated equipment across the network operate unattended and are fully automated. All calls, \nSMS  messages,  data  services,  and  applications  are  processed  by  computers.  The  labor-\nintensive  processes  are  network  and  customer  service.  However,  customer  service  is \noutsourced. \n \n44.  As is the case in most parts of the world, Bemobile\u2019s subscriber base is dominated by \nprepaid customers. The subscribers load or \u201ctop up\u201d their account by purchasing prepaid (top-up) \ncards. Top-ups are available in various denominations as low as K5 and can be purchased from \nmany  different  types  of  retailers,  street  vendors,  and  kiosks.  Bemobile  runs  a  variety  of \npromotions  that  reward  prepaid  subscribers  with  extra  free  top-up.  Bemobile  subsidizes \nhandsets as part of its marketing and promotion campaign, as sales and promotional offers are \nmade with a handset bundled with a subscriber identification module (SIM) card and some initial \ncalling minutes. A majority of the low-end handsets are partially subsidized to the consumer so \nas to accelerate sales. However, the handsets are \u201clocked\u201d so that the phone can only be used \non the Bemobile network. There is also a significant demand for high-end handsets.  \n \n45.  Power is  an operational issue for Bemobile, even in urban areas. Many of the sites are \nin rural areas where there is not even the option to connect to the power grid. Therefore all cell \nsites have at least one standby diesel generator. Local maintenance contractors must go to \nmost sites, some of which are only accessible via helicopter, at least once every 4\u20136 weeks to \nrefill diesel. However, this is the only significant maintenance needed for the sites.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n46.  Bemobile was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  Bemobile  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money \nlaundering  activities,  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and Bemobile will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n \n47.  Bemobile will continue to provide to the lenders, now including ADB, quarterly unaudited \nfinancial statements, quarterly operations reports, annual audited financial statements, annual \noperations reports, annual environmental and social monitoring reports, and annual business \nplans. It must report any important changes. ADB will monitor the project with regard to the \nbusiness plans, using information from its own sources and the public domain. Evaluation of the \nproject will be on three levels: (i) the success of the project, (ii) economic growth in PNG and \nSolomon Islands generally, and (iii) private sector development in PNG and Solomon Islands. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "10   \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n   1\n0\n \nA.  The Assistance    \n \n \n   A\np\n1.  Equity Investment  p\ne\n  n\nd\n48.  The proposed equity investment will involve ADB\u2019s subscription to up to 6% of the  ix 4\n \noutstanding ordinary shares in Bemobile (or to such lesser percentage as can be subscribed to \nfor $9 million),22 funded from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.  \n \n2.  Loan \n \n49.  The proposed ADB direct loan will be up to $40 million. The loan will be funded using \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n \n50.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  for  the  project  is  justified  based  on  its  value-added, \ndevelopment impacts, and demonstration effects. ADB will further add value as follows: \n \n(i)  The project will catalyze commercial financing and development financing into a \nmuch-needed infrastructure sector in both PNG and Solomon Islands. The local \ndebt market is limited at present, particularly for medium-term financing. Offshore \ncommercial and export credit sources are reluctant to extend uncovered financing to \nbusinesses in PNG and Solomon Islands due to perceived country risk issues. \n(ii)  The project will promote sustainable private sector participation with good corporate \ngovernance  and  strong  environmental  and  social  responsibility  in  PNG  and \nSolomon  Islands.  This  will  encourage  entrepreneurs  and  financial  investors  to \nconsider investments in key sectors in PNG, Solomon Islands, and the Pacific \nregion. \n(iii)  The  project  will  promote  free  competition  by  inducing  incumbent  operators  to \nimprove their service and performance in providing infrastructure services at a cost-\neffective level. \n(iv)  The project will augment strong commitment of ADB\u2019s private sector operations to \nsupport small-scale economies within its developing members. In particular, the \nproject helps to encourage the transfer of capital, technology, and experience from \nexperienced international sponsors to the developing member countries. \n \nC.  Assurances \n \n51.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 26  the \ngovernments of PNG and Solomon Islands have been requested to confirm that they have no \nobjection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  Bemobile.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the Board of Directors.   \n \n                                                \n22  The initial ADB equity investment will be no more than $8 million, and the remaining will be the contingent for future \ncapital calls. \n26 ADB. 1966.
