Using an integrated value chain (IVC) approach, \nthe  investment  program  will  invest  in  physical  and  institutional  links  along  horticultural  value \nchains 2  by  supporting  (i)  site  development  and  agribusiness  infrastructure,  (ii)  linking \ninfrastructure  to  ensure  connectivity  and  basic  services  across  the  value  chain,  (iii)  backward \nlinks  to  the  production  areas  through  contract  farming  and  producer  companies,  and  \n(iv)  capacity  building  to  strengthen  technical  and  managerial  skills  along  the  value  chain.  The \ninvestment  program  area  covers  selected  regions  of  Bihar  and  Maharashtra,  two  states  that \nhave  adopted  different  agri-marketing  policies:  Bihar  promotes  the  provision  of  agri-marketing \nas  a  private-sector-led  function,  and  Maharashtra  enables  greater  private  sector  participation \nbut leaves the role of regulator and market manager with the public sector. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIn  2009,  agriculture  contributed  16%  of  the  national  gross  domestic  product.  However, \n58%  of  the  workforce  continues  to  rely  on  agriculture  for  both  income  and  livelihood. 3 The \nEleventh Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012) targets an agriculture sector growth rate of 4%, bringing \nhigher  farmer  incomes  and  more  employment  opportunities  in  rural  areas,  and  therefore \npromoting  inclusive  economic  growth. 4  However,  agriculture  failed  to  achieve  the  planned \ngrowth  rates  for  the  previous  two  plan  periods,  leaving  rural  areas  in  pervasive  poverty.  The \ndeceleration in agricultural growth, as a result of not catalyzing private investment, has further \naccentuated  the  rural\u2013urban  divide.  Higher  incomes  and  employment  opportunities  in  rural \nareas  are  necessary  to  benefit  rural  households,  boost  off-farm  incomes,  redress  the  rural\u2013\nurban imbalance, and promote inclusive economic growth. Against this backdrop, the Eleventh \nFive-Year  Plan  targets  (i)  a  modern  efficient  marketing  infrastructure,  (ii)  backward  links \nbetween  markets  and  production  areas  to  give  producers  higher  prices,  and  (iii)  coordination \nalong the agricultural value chains. Private sector participation in all these activities is necessary \nto bring world-class technology and modern management to agri-marketing, and policy reforms \nhave  been  undertaken  to  allow  this.  To  attract  private  investment,  the  Government  of  India\u2019s \npolicy  framework  for  the  sector  promotes  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs),  and  provides \npublic  sector  capital  grants  to  private  sector  investors  wanting  to  establish  agribusiness \ninfrastructure with backward links. However, these are still in their infancy. \n \n\n                                                \n1  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  was  provided.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2008.  Technical \n\nAssistance to India for Preparing the Agribusiness Infrastructure Development Investment Program. Manila. \n\n2  The term \"value chain\" is used to characterize the interconnected, coordinated set of links and steps that occur as \nagricultural products'  transformations  and  transactions  take  place along a  chain  of  interrelated  activities  between \nprimary production and the final consumer.   \n\n3  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agricultural Production and Markets (Appendix 2). \n4  Government of India, 2006. Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012). New Delhi. \n\n \n\n\fPublic\u2013private  partnership.  The  Government  of  India  estimates  that  infrastructure \n4. \ninvestment of 8% of gross domestic product ($457 billion) is required to achieve the growth rate \ntargets  of  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  with  the  private  sector  providing  30%  through  PPPs. \nPPPs  have  gained  prominence  in  the  last  5  years,  especially  for  roads,  telecommunications, \nand power, where 450 PPP contracts so far total $50 billion. Although agriculture is not a focus \nsector,  the  plan  envisages  private  sector  investment  in  and  management  of  marketing \ninfrastructure, including modern logistics, cold chains, markets, and food processing plants.   \n \nThe  role  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  within  the  government  strategy,  as \n5. \nidentified  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  2009\u20132012,5 targets  higher  producer  returns \nand  more  private  investment  through  PPPs.  The  investment  program  seeks  (i)  to  develop \nspatially  and  institutionally  linked  IVCs  for  horticultural  high-value  crops  (HVCs),  and  (ii)  to \nenable small producers to associate in groups that can further evolve into producer companies \nto bargain for marketing opportunities. The supply of modern infrastructure under private sector \nmanagement  will  improve product quality, reduce post-harvest  waste,  and  add value  to lower-\nvalue  produce.  As  such,  the  investment  program  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership \nstrategy  and  with  the  ADB  Operational  Plan  for  Sustainable  Food  Security,6 which  suggests \nincreasing synergy and value addition in backward and forward links along the agricultural value \nchains. Further, the investment program will pioneer the mainstreaming of PPPs in agriculture, \ntargeting stronger capital formation in the sector. \n \n6. \nValue  chain  approach.  The  process  and  underlying  structure  of  the  investment \nprogram adopts an IVC approach.  By influencing the structures, systems, and relationships that \ndefine the value chain, the aim is to help farmers, traders, and other value chain stakeholders to \nimprove  their  products  and  processes,  increasing the  contribution  of  value  chain  output  to  the \nbenefit  of  all  the  members.  The  focus  of  the  IVC  approach  is  on  transforming  relationships, \nparticularly  between  players  linked  vertically  in  the  value  chain,  to  help  them  upgrade  and \nbecome competitive, and to adapt to changes in end markets to remain competitive.  \n \n7. \nThe  investment  program  will  actively  pursue  cooperation  and  synergies  with  other \ndevelopment  partners,  including  (i)  the  World  Bank  National  Agricultural  Innovation  Project, \n2006\u20132012;  (ii)  the  planned  World  Bank  Multi-State  Agriculture  Competitiveness  Program, \n2010\u20132016;  and  (iii)  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  Convergence  of \nAgricultural Interventions in Maharashtra, 2009\u20132017. While ADB has undertaken agribusiness \nprograms  in  the  South  Asia  region,  its  general  support  for  PPPs  is  limited  (there  have  been \nnone  in  the  sector).  The  following  key  lessons  were  incorporated  in  the  investment  program \ndesign:  (i)  agriculture  projects  promoting  diversification  into  HVCs  are  key  for  promoting \ninclusive  economic  growth  and  creating  opportunities  for  employment \nin  rural  areas,  \n(ii) changing the incentives for value chain stakeholders to respond to market demand signals is \nthe  most  effective  use  of  funds,  (iii)  farmer  organizations  involving  small  farmers  need  to  be \nstrengthened to increase their bargaining capability within the value chain, (iv) more cooperation \nbetween  public  and  private  sectors  is  necessary  to  ensure  agriculture  commercialization,  and \n(v) the structure of PPPs needs to be customized for development. \n \nThe  government  of  Bihar  seeks  to  move  the  provision  and  the  management  of \n8. \nagribusiness  facilities  to  the  private  sector.  A  key  policy  for  Bihar  is  the  building  of  marketing \nnetworks that operate as linked hierarchies from modern terminal markets, through agribusiness \ncenters,  to  rural  centers  including  on-farm,  first-step  processing  facilities.

ADB Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security. Manila. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\finvestment  is  $422  million  from  2010  to  2015,  with  the  private  sector  investing  $2.5  for  each \n$1.0  of  public  sector  investment.  The  Maharashtra  state  vision  focuses  on  providing  more \nmarketing  choices  for  producers  through  greater  private  sector  involvement  in  alternative \nmarketing channels for the development of modern value-adding and processing infrastructure, \nand post-harvest handling systems that reduce waste and increase value throughout the value \nchain. The total strategy is envisaged to cost $1.13 billion, of which $592 million is required in \nthe 2010\u20132015 period. The state government plans to invest up to 20% of this requirement. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  higher  value  of  horticulture  products \ncaptured by the stakeholders of the IVCs in selected regions of Bihar and Maharashtra, as the \nprivate  sector  brings  in  world-class  technology  and  modern  management.  The  investment \nprogram  outcome  will  be  the  investment  in  and  management  of  eight  or  more IVCs,  including \nsmall-scale farmers, by the private sector.  \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  investment  program  will  be  delivered  through  eight  or  more  PPP \n10. \ncontracts to private sector concessionaires, selected in a transparent and competitive way, who \nwill design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the IVCs. To attract private sector investors, a \npublic sector capital grant will be provided to a concessionaire, the bidding parameter being the \ntotal  amount  of  capital  grant  required  for  the  bidder  to  accept  the  contract.  Attracting \ninvestments from the private sector in agricultural marketing poses different challenges in Bihar \nand  Maharashtra,  making  it  necessary  to  use  different  PPP  approaches  to  the  perceived \nbusiness risks in each state. The maximum capital grant available to bidders will be 70% of the \ntotal  investment  cost  in  Bihar  and  40%  in  Maharashtra.  Bihar\u2019s  model  requires  that  the \nconcessionaire  will  pay  30%  of  the  IVC  gross  revenue  stream  back  to  the  government. \nConcessionaires in Maharashtra will provide more investment up front than in Bihar, but will not \nshare  future  revenues  with  the  state.  These  PPP  models  may  be  revised  based  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s  experience  in  implementing  the  AIDIP  and  other  sector  PPP  programs,  market \nconditions,  and  related  supporting  government  policies.  Selected  concessionaires  will  finalize \ndesign,  procure  works,  and  fully  manage  the  IVC  infrastructure. In  this  way,  the  investment \nprogram  will \ninto  agribusiness \ninfrastructure  on  publicly  owned  land,  within  geographically  linked  spokes  and  hubs,  each  of \nwhich  provides  collection  services,  grading,  packaging,  storing,  processing,  and  cold  storage \nfacilities to a range of HVCs.  \n \nC. \n\ninvestment  and  management \n\nleverage  private  sector \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe investment program outputs include (i) functional IVC infrastructure, (ii) stakeholders \neffectively  participating  in  and  properly  managing  the  IVCs,  and  (iii)  state  governments \nefficiently  performing  their  regulatory  and  oversight  functions  over  the  IVCs  and  the  PPP \ncontracts.  The  investment  program  outputs  will  be  delivered  through  two  components:  \n(i) support for IVCs, and (ii) institutional development and program management.   \n \n\n1.  \n\nSupport for Integrated Value Chains \n\n \n12. \nThis component will support the strengthening and/or establishment of infrastructure and \ninstitutional links among the value chain stakeholders for horticultural HVCs. The component will \nensure  that  IVCs  are  operational  by  financing  basic  and  agribusiness  infrastructure,  linking \ninfrastructure  to  ensure  connectivity  and  basic  utilities,  strengthening  and/or  establishing \nbackward  links,  and  supporting  technical  and  managerial  skills  development  along  the  value \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fchains. The component includes the following subcomponents, which will establish partnerships \nand  links  among  value  chain  stakeholders,  including  farmers,  processors,  agribusiness \nentrepreneurs, and service providers, which, along with the infrastructure support, will make the \nIVCs functional. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nRehabilitation  and  provision  of  site  infrastructure  for  market  development, \noperated  by  the  private  sector  on  a  PPP  basis,  such  as  internal  roads,  solid \nwaste management systems, boundary walls, water drainage. \nRehabilitation  and  construction  of  agribusiness  infrastructure,  operated  by  the \nprivate  sector  on  a  PPP  basis,  such  as  pre-cooling  facilities,  transportation, \nwashing and ripening facilities, grading and sorting facilities, packaging facilities, \ninformation  technology  systems,  and  ambient  and  controlled  temperature \nstorage.7 \nEstablishment of linking infrastructure along the value chain, i.e., infrastructure to \nprovide the IVC with basic utilities (such as power and water) and to increase the \nIVC connectivity through proper  roads (such as rural roads to production areas, \nand access roads to markets).8 \nStrengthening and/or establishing IVC backward links to the production areas so \nthat  producers  can  participate  in  the  IVC  activities.  To  take  advantage  of  better \nmarketing efficiency and value-adding options along the IVC, small farmers must \ncoordinate  their  decisions,  aggregate  their  produce,  and  improve  their  product \nquality.  To  develop  farmers'  capacity  to  do  so,  the  investment  program  will \norganize  small  producers  into  farmer  companies  and  will  provide  farmers  with \ntraining  in  value  addition  to  improve  their  production  and  marketing  decisions, \nincrease their marketing efficiency, and raise their profitability.9  \nCapacity  development  along  the  IVC  to  enhance  the  capability  in technical  and \nmanagerial skills to operate IVCs will be provided by the concessionaire and the \nexecuting  agency,  according  to  the  needs.  The  capacity  development  activities \nfor  the  technical  skills  will  be  determined  by  the  equipment  bought  and  the \nfacilities established along the IVC and will be purchased by the concessionaire \njointly  with  specific  IVC  equipment.  The  capacity  development  activities  for  the \nmanagerial skills will be provided by the executing agency as needed.  \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Development and Program Management \n\n \n13. \nTo  establish  sound  project  and  PPP  contract  management  systems,  program \nmanagement units (PMUs) in each state will provide implementation support, consisting of staff, \noffice facilities and equipment, consulting services, and liaison and coordination with other  line \nagencies.  There  will  be  baseline  surveys,  and  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation.  PMUs  will \nestablish  and  maintain  a  website  with  information  on  project  activities,  including  procurement \nprocedures  and  results.  A  technical  advisory  group  (TAG)  with  the  requisite  experience  and \nskills will be engaged by each PMU to ensure that the PPP transactions for the establishment of \nthe IVC infrastructure are successfully completed and their implementation monitored. The role \n\n                                                \n7  More commercial components might be leveraged by the establishment of IVCs and developed around the IVCs by \nthe private sector, which will be free to use funds, as applicable, from existing government schemes, outside the \ninvestment program. \n\n8  The contracting of infrastructure will be through the relevant public sector agency. \n9  The project Improving Small Farmers\u2019 Access to Integrated Value Chains in Bihar and Maharashtra, for $3 million, \nfunded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  was  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  on  30  July  2010  to \ncomplement this sub-component. \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv)  recruiting  domain  experts  as  per  agreed \n\nand  responsibilities  of  the  TAG  will  include:  (i)  managing  the  entire  bidding  process,  including \nmarketing  the  projects;  (ii)  inviting  expressions  of  interest  for  requests  for  qualifications  and \nrequests  for  proposals;  (iii)  evaluating  the  bids  and  selecting  the  private  sector  entity \n(concessionaire); \nterms  of  reference;  \n(v)  monitoring  and  evaluating  IVC  implementation  during  construction  and  operations;  \n(vi)  planning  and  implementing  capacity  building  and  training  programs  along  the  IVC;  and  \n(vii) preparing subsequent MFF tranches.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  states  plan  to  invest  a  total  of  about  $1  billion.  The  total  cost  of  the  investment \nprogram  is  estimated  at  $212.2  million,  including  taxes  and  duties,  commitment  charges,  and \ninterest during construction. The investment plan is summarized in Table 1.  ADB will finance a \npart  of  local  taxes  and  duties  estimated  at  $18.6 million.

The  MFF  will \nconsist  of  several  tranches  (at  least  four),  subject  to  the  government's  submission  of  related \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFRs),  execution  of  the  related  loan  and  project  agreements  for \neach  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the \nframework financing agreement (FFA). Tranche 1 of the MFF will have a 25-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum, and other such terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Government of India has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nSource \n\nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB.

PFR1 will finance the program outputs as \nper section C, paras. 11 to 13. \n  \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n17. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe Facility Administration Manual (FAM) (Appendix 2). The executing agencies for the MFF will \nbe  the  Bihar  Department  of  Agriculture  and  the  Maharashtra  Department  of  Cooperation, \nMarketing  and  Textile.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  PMUs  within  the  Department  of \nAgriculture  in  Bihar  and  the  Maharashtra  State  Agriculture  Marketing  Board  in  Maharashtra. \nThey  will  coordinate  overall  implementation  of  the  projects  through  administrative  support, \ncontracting  of  the  PPP  transactions,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  financial  management. \nEach PMU will subcontract professional experts to support the bidding process, the preparation \nof  detailed  project  reports  for  subsequent  PFRs,  and  the  implementation  of  capacity \ndevelopment  activities.  All  IVC  projects  to  be  included  under  the  MFF  will  meet  the  selection \ncriteria  in Schedule  4 of  the  FFA.  The  PMUs  will  invite  bids  from the  private  sector to design, \nconstruct, operate, and maintain the IVC infrastructure, as described in para. 12, (i) and (ii), and \nwill contract them on a PPP basis, with land provided by the government.  \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n10 Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \n\nArrangements \n\nImplementation period \n\nDecember 2010\u2013December 2017 \n\nEstimated investment \nprogram completion date \n\nProgram management \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n31 December 2017 \n\n \n\n \nNational Steering Committee \n\nChair: Secretary, MOA \nMembers: DEA, GOB, GOM \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n\nDepartment of Agriculture in Bihar \nDepartment of Cooperation, Marketing and Textile in Maharashtra  \n\n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nDepartment of Agriculture in Bihar, MSAMB in Maharashtra \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Project \n\nimplementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\n \n\nEach  PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  managing  director  appointed  by \nthe state government. The PMU will be staffed by full- time managers for \n(i)  technical  matters  (agriculture  marketing,  agribusiness  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  horticulture/agriculture);  (ii)  financial  management,  and  (iii) \nlegal  and  administration.  The  PMU  will  have  a  team  comprising  staff \ndeputed  from  the  executing  agency  and  associated  line  departments \nand/or recruited from the market. \n\nAll goods  and services to  be financed  under the MFF will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time)  \n\nAll  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time) \n\nUnder  each  tranche,  ADB  may,  subject  to  its  policies  and  procedures, \nallow on request advance  contracting and retroactive financing  of eligible \nexpenditures  under  the  MFF  up  to  20%  of  the  proposed  individual  loan, \nincurred  before  loan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before \nthe date of signing of the related legal agreement. \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.  \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DEA  =  Department  of  Economic  Affairs,  GOB  =  Government  of  Bihar,  GOM  = \nGovernment  of  Maharashtra,  MFF  =  multitranche  financing  facility,  MOA  =  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  MSAMB  = \nMaharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nThe  IVCs  to  be  financed  by  the  MFF  under  PFR1  (Muzaffarpur  and  Nalanda\u2013Patna \nregions  of  Bihar)  are  assessed  to  be  economically  feasible,  with  economic  internal  rates  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  ranging  from  19.0%  to  24.0%.  When  all  IVCs  are  combined  and  their \nmanagement  and  institutional  costs  are  included,  the  EIRR  remains  at  15.9%,  indicating \nsufficiently high economic return compared with the discount rate of 12.0%. Sensitivity analysis \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fof the EIRR for PFR1 for additional overheads for the PMU and different sharing of institutional \ncosts between PFR1 and the subsequent PFRs shows that the EIRR increases to 16.3%. \n \n19. \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  the  investment  and  the  implementing  agency's  ability  to \nsupport  the  financial  costs  for  managing  the  two  concession  agreements  was  assessed.  The \nfinancial assessment of the PPP models indicate that the revenue-sharing agreement with the \nconcessionaires  will  cover  the  expected  costs  per  annum  for  maintaining  PMU  staffing  and \noperation, showing no risk to financial sustainability. A major impact of the investment program \nwill  be  to  provide  proof  of  concept  for  the  use  of  PPPs  for  agri-marketing  facilities  and  their \nmanagement.  The  investment  program  will  catalyze  investment  from  the  private  sector  in \nagribusiness  infrastructure,  bringing  modern  technology  and  providing  better  services  to  the \nvalue chain users. This will have significant post-investment program multiplier effects through \nadoption  of  more  advanced  technologies  brought  in  by  the  private  sector,  and  broader \nprocessing  and  marketing  opportunities.  The  higher  returns  to  the  stakeholders  of  the  value \nchains will ensure that the IVC will be sustainable (Appendix 2) \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nThe  executing  agencies  have  limited  experience  in  implementing  externally  funded \nprojects,  but  have  the  organizational  structure,  skills,  and  financial  management  system \nrequired  to  implement  them.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  and \nconfirmed  that  the  proposed  executing  agencies  follow  the  Government  of  India's  General \nFinance  Rules  (2005)  and  use  accounting  systems  compatible  with  international  accounting \nstandards.  There  are  no  major  issues  with  the  accounting  policies  and  procedures.  However, \nsome measures to boost governance of the investment program will include (i) preparation of a \nfinancial  management  manual  for  the  investment  program;  (ii)  the  requirement  for  PMUs  to \nfollow government rules and procedures for all expense and capital items, including cash, and \nthe  proper  maintenance  of  financial  records;  and  (iii)  the  requirement  for  PMUs  to  hire  the \nproper  financial  staff  as  agreed  with  ADB.  An  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will \nannually  audit  all  investment  program-related  accounts,  statements  of  expenditure,  and \nrevenues.  All  audit  reports  and  certified financial statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6 \nmonths of the close of the year under audit. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  executing  agencies.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n21. \nThe investment program will promote inclusive economic growth and food security, and \nwill  directly  benefit  the  rural  areas,  by  creating  employment opportunities  on-farm  and  off-farm \nactivities and increasing farm gate prices. Although the primary focus of the investment program \nis on making the horticultural value chains modern and efficient, a significant number of poor are \nalso likely to be beneficiaries of the  projects, because over 60% of small and medium farmers \nand  small  traders  belong  to  socially  backward  communities. Vulnerable groups  were  identified \nand  estimated  in  all  the  project  districts.  Under  tranche  1,  it  is  estimated  that  300  full-time \nemployees  will  work  for  the  IVCs,  a  further  3,486  day  workers  will  be  provided  with  additional \n300  days  of  work  per  year,  and  a  total  of  112,300  suppliers  will  directly  benefit  from  the \ninvestment,  through  higher  returns  from  crop  production,  reduced  post-harvest  losses  (20%\u2013\n30%),  and  increased  value  addition  along  the  IVCs.  The  landless  poor  will  benefit  from  the \ncreation  of  additional  employment  opportunities  along  the  IVCs  and  ancillary  industries. \nBoosting  the  capacity  of  farmer  groups  will  raise  their  bargaining  power  and  link  them  more \neffectively to the value chain.  \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n22. \nIn  rural  areas,  the  workforce  participation  rate  for  women  is  27.2%  (nearly  thrice  as \nmuch  as  the  urban  female  participation  rate  of  9.7%),  and  89.5%  of  all  women  employed  are \nengaged in the agriculture and allied industrial sector. Women in both states play a key role in \nall  aspects  of  agriculture  from  sowing  to  selling  of  the  produce.  However,  women  are  not \nsubstantively involved in decisions about the production and marketing of produce, and tend to \nmarket their produce through middlemen.  Furthermore, 60%\u201380% of women cultivators in the \ninvestment  program  areas  belong \nto  marginalized  and  other  backward  communities. \nEmpowering  female  agricultural  workers  through  participation  in  farmer  societies  will  give \nwomen  a  voice  in  decision  making  and  will  integrate  them  in  the  value  chain.  Their  effective \nintegration into the value chain will raise their incomes and reduce wage discrimination, thereby \nsupporting  accomplishment  of  core  labor  standards  in  a  sector  where  a  large  part  of  the \nproduction is in the informal sector. \n \n23. \nThe rural focus of the investment program helps address the growing rural\u2013urban divide \nin  the  incidence  of  poverty  and  economic  development  of  the  country.  Also,  complementing \npublic  sector  investment  with  private  investment  will  accelerate  growth,  employment,  and \neconomic  prosperity  in  rural  areas.  Provision  of  linking  infrastructure  will  help  complete  the \nconnectivity, reduce costs, increase mobility, and have supplementary social benefits.11 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n24. \nAn  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  was  developed  for  the  MFF \n(Appendix  2).  Proposed  investments  under  tranche  1  in  Bihar  are  classified  as  environmental \ncategory B, and an initial environmental examination (IEE) with an environmental management \nplan  (EMP)  was prepared in accordance with ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The \nIEE  concludes  that  there  will  be  no  significant  adverse  impact,  and  most  of  the  impacts \npredicted are temporary, typical and easy to alleviate with the mitigating measures suggested in \nthe EMP, such as dust generation and noise during construction. Better infrastructure will allow \nbetter  systems  to  manage  solid  and  liquid  waste,  and  stronger  traffic  management  within  the \nfacilities, resulting in  environmental  improvements.  In the  preparation  of the IEE,  consultations \nwere  held  with  farmers,  potentially  affected  traders,  government,  and  potential  private \ndevelopers.  During  detailed  engineering  stages,  the  potential  developers  will  conduct  further \nconsultations,  update the  EMP  and  IEE  as  needed,  and  make  all  environmental  assessments \navailable  to  the  general  public  in  a  form  that  concerned  people  and  other  stakeholders  can \nunderstand. While the implementation of the EMP will be the responsibility of the IVC developer, \neach  state  pollution  control  board  and  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  effective \nimplementation  of  the  EMP.  The  PMUs  will  be  provided  with  environmental  consultants,  if  so \nrequired, to supplement government staff for environmental monitoring. \n \nThe  envisioned  interventions  will  not  have  adverse  social  or  resettlement  impacts,  or \n25. \nnegative effects on indigenous peoples and ethnic minority groups. Construction will take place \non government land and existing rights of way. The investment program will exclude any parts \nthat  would  entail  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  (IR),  including  relocation.12 The \nlocations of the first two tranches do not involve areas with indigenous peoples (IP) and ethnic \nminority groups.13 For this, the proposed investments under tranche 1 in Bihar are classified as  \ncategory C for IR and IP. \n\n                                                \n11 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n12 Resettlement Framework  (Appendix 2). \n13 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks  and  mitigating  measures  developed \n\n26. \nthe  Risk  Assessment  and  Risk \nManagement  Plan  (Appendix  2)  are  summarized  in  Table  4.
