THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, (ii) a proposed grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia, \nand (iii) a proposed grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Project.1 \nPF FP\n \n2.  The  project2  will  enhance  transboundary  cooperation  for  preventing  and  mitigating \nPF FP\nfragmentation of biodiversity rich forest landscapes of the Cardamom Mountains and Eastern \nPlains Dry Forest in Cambodia, Triborder Forest areas located in southern Lao PDR, and the \nCentral Annamites in Viet Nam.3 The design of the biodiversity corridors4 is embedded within a \nPF FP PF FP\nmultiple  use  and  multilayered  landscape  approach.  Project  interventions  will  promote \nsustainable resource use, restore and improve vegetative cover in marginal lands, and address \nconstraints  to  land  tenure  and  rural  household  access  to  socioeconomic  assets,  thereby \nenhancing the productivity of these landscapes. The project will (i) provide tenurial security to \npoor households and ethnic minority groups for collaborative management of forest resources; \n(ii) restore habitat on degraded forestlands with tree planting of native species, and agroforestry \nmodels with improved sources of nontimber forest products (NTFPs); (iii) improve livelihoods \nand income-enhancing small-scale infrastructure; (iv) generate over 5 million cash-based labor \ndays through project activities; and (v) augment ecosystem service flows and benefits through \ncarbon  sequestration  and  improved  watershed  management.  The  project  is  positioned  for \nmultiple types of long-term financial support for expanded and sustained local and civil society \nengagement in natural resource management.5 The project will cover an area of more than 1.93 \nPF FP\nmillion hectares (ha) involving 22 communes in Cambodia, 69 villages in the Lao PDR, and 34 \ncommunes in Viet Nam with a total population of 172,000 or 35,000 households, with 58% \nidentified as ethnic minorities and more than 50% considered poor. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The six GMS6 governments, with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nPF FP\nnongovernment  organization  partners,  have  identified  the  most  important  biodiversity \nconservation landscapes in the GMS that are vulnerable to increased development pressures \nand  environmental  degradation  (attached  map).  These  regionally  and  globally  high-value \nbiodiversity landscapes and watersheds need to be conserved to safeguard local livelihoods \nand investments in energy and hydropower, transport, water, and food security enhancing \nsectors. Recognizing this need, the GMS leaders endorsed the Core Environment Program and \nBiodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative (CEP-BCI) at the Second GMS Summit in July \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 \nP2P  ADB provided project preparatory TA. ADB 2009. Technical Assistance for the Biodiversity Conservation Corridors \nP P\nin the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. \n3  The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity identifies ecosystem fragmentation as a key driver of loss of \nP P\nglobal biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. \n4  Biodiversity corridors are geographic areas within or cutting across GMS economic corridors that need to be placed \nP P\nunder sustainable management regimes to secure local livelihoods, address habitat fragmentation, and maintain \necosystem services. They ensure the continuity of ecological processes between natural protected areas. \n5  By supporting sustainable forest management practices, the project will assist in securing long-term financing for \nP P\nconservation of transboundary landscapes. It could serve as a funding bridge to Reduced Emissions from \nDeforestation and Forest Degradation and Conservation and Enhancement of Carbon Stocks (REDD/REDD+) \nmechanisms and REDD carbon market opportunities. \n6  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \nP P", "2   \n2005, with the biodiversity corridors initiative (BCI) as the flagship component.7 The project \nPF FP\nrepresents the first generation of investments emerging from the pilot phase (2006\u20132009) of the \nCEP-BCI.8 \nPF FP\n \n4.  The  development  of  GMS  transport  infrastructure  is  connecting  people,  natural \nresources,  and  markets;  and  acting  as  a  catalyst  for  broader  economic  development.    \nResource-rich,  relatively  remote  locations  such  as  Koh  Kong  and  Mondulkiri  provinces  in \nCambodia, Attapeu and Sekong provinces in the Lao PDR, and Quang Nam and Quang Tri \nprovinces in Viet Nam have recently been connected to markets through the development or \nupgrading  of  major  transboundary  roads  that  provide  the  backbone  of  the  North\u2013South \nEconomic  Corridor,  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor,  and  Southern  Economic  Corridor.  The \ninvestment  plans  to  convert  these  transport  corridors  into  economic  corridors  need  to  be \nembedded in an ecosystem management approach. Failure to do so risks jeopardizing the \nP P\nnature  and  magnitude  of  ecosystem  service  flows,  including  biodiversity  conservation  and \ncarbon sequestration benefits to local communities, and undermining the performance and \nsustainability of investments. 9 \nPF FP\n \n5.  Development  pressures. The development of regional hydropower systems, roads, \nlarge-scale tourism infrastructure, mining, and plantation agriculture ventures pose challenges \nto  these  biodiversity  conservation  landscapes.  Hydropower  development  of  more  than  \n900 megawatts is envisaged in the project area.10 In the provinces of Attapeu, Champasak, and \nPF FP\nSekong, which are the focus of BCI landscapes connecting to the Lao PDR, nearly 97,000 ha \nare expected to be inundated from the planned hydropower investments.11 In addition, some \nPF FP\n600,000  ha  are  under  various  mining  and  logging  concessions,  indicating  rapid  natural \nresources  sector-led  growth. 12  Similarly,  in  the  Cardamom  Mountains  in  Cambodia,  22 \nPF FP\nproposed hydropower stations will inundate large forest areas, while in Mondulkiri province in \nnortheast Cambodia, 18 hydropower dams are proposed.13 In Viet Nam, the BCI sites spanning \nPF FP\n1.7 million ha will come under increasing pressure with eight hydropower dams planned to meet \nthe rapidly growing demand for electricity (15% per annum).14 In addition to the development of \nPF FP\nproductive sectors, climate change is likely to have an additional effect on ecosystem services. \nIncreasing weather variability, and extreme weather events and shifts in agro-ecological zones \nare likely to increase vulnerability of ecosystem services and amplify impacts on dependent \npoor communities.15  \nPF FP\n                                                 \n7  Supported by ADB. 2005.

The project is in line with the GMS 10-year (2002\u2013\n2012) strategic framework thrust: protecting the environment and promoting sustainable use of \nshared natural resources. The project will contribute to pillar 4 of ADB's regional cooperation \nand integration strategy: cooperation in regional public goods. The project will also support the \nnew  GMS  strategic  framework  (2012\u20132022),  currently  being  prepared,  and  the  process  of \ntransitioning from GMS transport corridors into full-fledged economic corridors. Sustainable \nenvironmental management is a critical aspect of the poverty reduction strategies in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, with more than two-thirds of the population directly deriving their \nsustenance from natural resources and agricultural sectors. The project is aligned with the \ntargets of the National Strategic Development Plan Update 2009\u20132013 of Cambodia; the draft \nVII National Socio Economic Development Plan 2011\u20132015 of the Lao PDR; and Article 9 of the \nrecently  approved  Biodiversity  Law  (Law  No.  20/2008/QH12),  the  Forestry  Development \nStrategy to 2020 (Prime Minister Decision No. 18/2007/QD-TTg, 5 February 2007), and the \noverall socioeconomic development objectives of Viet Nam for 2011\u20132015. \n \n7.  Lessons from sector interventions and the CEP-BCI pilot phase. The project design \nis informed by lessons from ADB support to the Tonle Sap Initiative in Cambodia,16 and ongoing \nPF FP\nsector interventions in the Lao PDR17 and Viet Nam.18 These overwhelmingly suggest that        \nPF FP PF FP\n(i) decentralized community-oriented management approaches offer the best chance of success \nin  addressing  environment  and  natural  resource  issues,  and  (ii)  provincial  coordination  of \nmultisector interventions needs to go hand-in-hand with developing the implementation capacity \nof line agencies.19 The BCI pilot phase demonstrates that coupling conservation with direct \nPF FP\nlivelihood  improvement  is  feasible  as  demonstrated  by  piloting  conservation  stewardship \nprograms delivering direct cash income of about $800,000 to more than 28,000 beneficiaries, \nand avoiding deforestation and forest degradation of more than 2 million ha.20 It also confirmed \nPF FP\nthat viable alternatives can be designed and deployed for (i) using local communities as willing \nand able service providers to undertake biodiversity restoration and conservation investments; \n(ii)  integrating  conservation  priorities  in  investment  decision-making  processes;  and                 \n(iii) increasing the economic returns to hydropower and tourism investments through payment \nfor ecosystem service policy and financial regimes. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  climate-resilient  sustainable  forest  ecosystems \nbenefiting local livelihoods. The project\u2019s outcome will be sustainably managed biodiversity \ncorridors in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The outputs are (i) institutions and communities strengthened for biodiversity corridor \nmanagement;  (ii)  biodiversity  corridors  restored,  protected,  and  maintained;  (iii)  livelihoods \nimproved and small-scale infrastructure support provided in target villages and communes; and \n(iv) project management and support services operationalized. \n                                                 \n16 ADB.

Output  1:  Institutions  and  communities  strengthened  for  biodiversity  corridor \nmanagement. Investments under this output will focus on (i) strengthening the capacity of the \nnational, provincial, district, and commune bodies for corridor planning and management; and \n(ii) providing protection and sustainable use policies, guidelines, and/or local regulations for \nenforcing  biodiversity  corridor  management  plans.  In  particular,  activities  will  contribute  to  \n(i) management plans and corridor policy and legal framework covering around 1.93 million ha \nof forest and nonforest land in 56 communes and 69 villages spread across Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam; and (ii) participatory land use maps and commune and village investment \nplans with delineation and demarcation of permanent forest boundaries and provision of new \nland use certificates.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Biodiversity corridors restored, protected, and maintained. The focus is \non commune and village-based forest protection and restoration. The bulk of the investments \nunder output 2 will target forest restoration, covering 19,200 ha in the form of natural forest \nreplanting, enrichment planting, NTFP planting, and agroforestry. Restoration activities include \nlabor inputs provided by women on a cash basis, thus improving household incomes. Activities \nto identify viable reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and conservation \nand  enhancement  of  carbon  stocks  (REDD/REDD+)  pilot  sites  will  enable  the  project  to \nleverage incremental funding for forest protection and restoration (an additional 16,100 ha) from \nfunds  specifically  set  up  to  promote  REDD.  The  commune  and  village  development  fund \nmechanism will be used as a decentralized local instrument to receive REDD funding for carbon \nsequestration. The project will also assist the selected districts in the provinces to establish \ninventory  sample  plots,  conduct  biodiversity  surveys,  and  draft  village/commune  forest \nmanagement plans. \n \n12.  Output 3: Livelihoods improved and small-scale infrastructure support provided. \nDemand-driven livelihood and small-scale infrastructure subprojects prioritized in participatory \nconsultations at the start of project will be identified and undergo a rigorous screening process. \nEach selected commune has a block allocation for livelihood improvements comprising NTFP \nproduction and processing, home gardens, livestock farming and other interventions selected by \nbeneficiaries. Some of these livelihood options can also be pursued through the mechanism of \nthe commune and village development funds, which will provide microfinancing facilities to \nhouseholds to borrow for their projects of choice. At least 4,775 households and more than \n4,000  farmers  will  receive  technical  and  cash  support  for  livelihood  and  productivity \nenhancement. In addition to livelihood interventions, the selected communes and villages will \nreceive small-scale infrastructure support ($100,000 per village in the Lao PDR, $150,000 per \ncommune in Cambodia, and $235,000 per commune in Viet Nam). Small-scale infrastructure \nsupport will primarily focus on (i) commune-based potable water schemes; (ii) provision of waste \nmanagement and sanitation facilitations; and (iii) improvement and upgrading of rural access \nroads from communes to markets. Special attention will be given to ensure that the poor and \nethnic minority groups participate equitably in subproject benefits.  \n \n13.  Output 4: Project management and support services operationalized. The project \nwill resource the management structures for a sector-like project that is supervised by the \nexecuting agencies in capital cities but implemented from provincially based provincial project \nmanagement  units  (PPMUs)  and  provincial  project  offices  (PPOs).  The  central  project \ncoordination units (CPCUs), central project management units (CPMUs), and national project \nmanagement units (NPMUs) will coordinate (i) consultant recruitment and supervision; and (ii) \nprocurement of materials, equipment, and vehicles during project implementation. Feasibility \nstudies, and design and implementation of subprojects will be coordinated and supervised by \nthe  PPMUs  and  PPOs.  Geographic  information  system  (GIS)-based  databases  will  be ", "      5 \nestablished for project performance monitoring. Regional baselines and predecision appraisals \nwill build on the regional, national, and provincial data layers already established under the \nCEP-BCI and through the project preparatory technical assistance (TA). \n \nD.

They \nwill also have a role in providing policy guidance on climate change and carrying out monitoring \nand  oversight  on  environment  and  social  safeguards.  The  GMS  Environment  Operations \nCenter22  will  support  oversight  and  data  coordination,  as  well  as  implementation  through \nPF FP\ntechnical assessments.23  \nPF FP\n \n18.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  Project preparation and implementation for reforestation and restoration will (i) ensure \nthat appropriate species are chosen for specific sites to optimize production, and (ii) improve \nand  protect  the  environment.  Most  of  the  livelihood  interventions  (agroforestry,  NTFP, \nagroprocessing) are either within the technical capacity of the provincial and district teams or \ncan be easily procured through short-term consultancy inputs and other extension services \nwithin the target countries. Small-scale infrastructure priorities indicated by the beneficiaries \nrevolve  around  water  wells  or  potable  water  schemes,  provision  of  latrines,  and  repair  or \nrehabilitation of rural access roads. Due to the mountainous terrain, greater attention to design \nand implementation quality will be needed. The focus of the civil works implementation will be \non quality rather than maximizing coverage, and designs will be based on appropriate standards \nto ensure sustainability. \n \n ", "8   \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  The economic viability of proposed interventions was assessed by adopting appropriate \nmodels applicable for the region. The project is expected to yield major benefits, including  \n(i) incremental employment for households and local communities generated from proposed \ninvestments for boundary surveys, demarcation, inventories, and reforestation, that in turn will \nprovide incentives to engage in corridor planning and management activities; (ii) improved \nlivelihoods through innovative mechanisms to engage local communities in conservation and \nprovision  of  essential  rural  infrastructure  facilities;  (iii)  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \navoidance of significant water-related diseases and health-care related costs; and (iv) public \nand  private  utilities,  enterprises,  and  downstream  farmers  benefiting  from  the  enhanced \necosystem services generated through the action of direct beneficiaries. The value of improved \nlandscape management will include gains from increased carbon sequestration and resultant \nemission reductions; expanded ecotourism potential; and losses avoided from flood damage, \nextreme weather events, saltwater inundation of coastal aquifers, and costs associated with \nreduced and irregular river flow. The project is expected to generate social benefits that accrue \nto communities, local government units, and private and nongovernment organizations through \nstakeholder  empowerment  resulting  from  the  project\u2019s  institutional  and  capacity-building \ninterventions.  The  project  will  instill  among  the  stakeholders  a  sense  of  accountability  in \nsustaining and managing the local natural resource base. Analysis of representative investment \nmodels generated economic internal rates of return greater than the opportunity cost threshold \nof 12%, confirming that the project is economically viable.25 \nPF FP\n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  All procurement to be financed by ADB loan and grant funds will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Project \nimplementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the governments\u2019 \nstandard operating procedures. MOE, MAFF, MAF, and MONRE have given assurance that all \naccounts administered by the CPMU, CPCU, NPMU, PPMUs, and PPOs are consolidated and \naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB.26 The project will strengthen the capacities of \nPF FP\nthe CPMU, CPCU, PPMU, and PPO staff in financial management procedures to allow the \nefficient  operation  of  advance  accounts  and  the  reporting  of  financial  performance  to  the \ngovernment  and  ADB.  The  project  will  establish  or  use  existing  ministerial  websites  to  (i) \ndisclose implementation progress and bid notifications and their results, and (ii) provide a \ngrievance mechanism against any corrupt practice. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the executing agencies in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n23.  The direct beneficiaries of the project are poor upland farmers, indigenous communities, \nand women living in and dependent on the forest ecosystem in 56 communes and 69 villages \nacross Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. 27 An estimated 35,000 households will benefit \nPF FP\nfrom the project; the majority of whom are indigenous peoples in remote, mountainous areas. \nAverage annual household incomes range from $160 to $450.

An  analysis  of \necosystem services within the biodiversity corridors is presented in Supplementary Appendix B. \n26 A good governance framework was prepared and is attached to the PAM for Cambodia. \nP27P Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nP P", "      9 \nbeneficiaries  of subprojects  range  from  25%  to  60%.  Investments  in stabilization  of forest \nresources  (restoration),  livelihood  interventions,  and  small-scale  infrastructure  will  improve \nincomes and food security of rural households in the corridors. Livelihood assets will be directly \nsupported through the provision of land use rights.   \n \n24.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming as it addresses gender \nempowerment  by  narrowing  gender  disparities  through  access  to  economic  and  financial \nresources  and  opportunities  (i.e.,  land  with  security  of  land  tenure,  off-farm  employment \nopportunities) and enhancing voices and rights (i.e., representation in project decision-making \nbodies).  Further,  the  project  will  provide  women  in  the  target  communities  with  improved \ninfrastructure that will enable increased productivity and incomes; reduced work burdens; and \nimproved access to educational, health, and social services. For vulnerable groups (primarily \nhouseholds headed by women), preferential cash-based opportunities for employment will be \navailable.  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared28  to  facilitate  empowerment  of  women  for \nPF FP\nparticipation  and  decision  making  in  all  aspects  of  corridor  management  and  investment \nactivities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  Environment (category B). Project interventions in forest reforestation and protection \nwill generate tangible and substantial environmental benefits. Any potentially adverse impacts \nassociated  with  livelihood  improvement  and  small-scale  infrastructure  support  due  to  their \nlocation,  design,  construction,  and  operation  is  expected  to  be  minimal  or  insignificant. \nMoreover, subprojects will be screened to exclude those that may cause significant damage and \nprovide  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  was \nprepared29 to comply with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and is \nPF FP\nbased on ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \n \n26.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). No resettlement or physical displacement is \nexpected because the small-scale infrastructure subprojects will be improved along existing \nrights-of-way, follow existing alignments, and based on priorities selected by beneficiaries as \nagreed in participatory, multistakeholder consultations at project start with voluntary in-kind \ncommitments (i.e., labor, materials, land, right-of-way). A resettlement framework has been \nprepared and mitigating measures are incorporated in subproject selection criteria consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.30  \nPF FP\n \n27.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and ethnic \ngroups comprise the major beneficiaries of the project. The governments and ADB have agreed \non an indigenous peoples planning framework.31 For most subprojects, where the majority of \nPF FP\nbeneficiaries are ethnic minorities, measures to improve their welfare and protect their rights will \nbe included in the subproject design. Where appropriate, combined resettlement and indigenous \npeoples plans will be prepared. All data collected will be disaggregated by ethno-linguistic group \nand gender to allow for monitoring and evaluation of beneficiary inclusion.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.32  \nPF FP\n \n                                                 \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nP29P Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nP30P Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nP31P Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nP32P Detailed measures are provided in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of \nP P\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nAd hoc development investment  (i) the project provides land use planning and tenurial security;         \ndecisions override long-term  (ii) strategic environmental assessments of corridor plans under the \nbiodiversity corridor plans   CEP-BCI will assess and provide a framework for addressing \ninvestment risks and trade-offs.  \nLimited provincial implementation  Project preparatory advance actions will provide targeted capacity \ncapacity  building and training.
