THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) to \nMongolia  for  the  Improving  School  Dormitory  Environment  for  Primary  Students  in  Western \nRegion Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support reform of the school dormitory system in Mongolia to ensure equal \naccess to quality education for all students, particularly those from herder families who live a \nnomadic  life,  by  establishing  and  implementing  models  to  improve  the  physical  dormitory \nenvironment and related services. The models will be developed and piloted in three aimags \n(provinces) of the western region;2 the region has (i) a poverty head count ratio that exceeds the \nnational average, (ii) a high proportion of students from herder families in dormitories, (iii) the \nlowest  net  intake  rate  in  grade  1,3 and  (iv)  the  lowest  regional  primary  completion  rate  in \nMongolia.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.   Rationale \n \n3.  The Government of Mongolia attaches great importance to education. The Education Law \nstipulates that all school-age children be provided with 9 years of free compulsory education, and \nthe government has been striving to ensure access to education.5 In the 2010s, the net enrollment \nratio has been maintained above 95% for primary level, and 90% for junior secondary level, and \nthe  literacy  rate  for  youth  (aged  15\u201324)  above  98.5%.  Public  spending  on  education  has \nconsistently  been  above  5%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Since  2012  the  government  has \nimplemented reforms to make the education system more responsive to the learning needs of \nindividual students. \n \n4.  Mongolia is sparsely populated, and the number of livestock far exceeds the population. \nAlthough the number of herders is declining, a substantial percentage of the economically active \npopulation\u201426.1% in 2014\u2014is engaged in herding. Mongolia\u2019s school dormitory system was \ndeveloped to ensure access to education, particularly for students from herder families, and has \nbeen supported by special provisions in the Education Law since 1982. Before 1995, dormitories \nwere fully funded by the government, and were a contributing factor in Mongolia\u2019s high primary- \nand secondary-level enrollment ratios before the transition from a centrally planned to a market \neconomy.6 However, the introduction in 1995 of parental fees for dormitory meals and other \nservices (in response to cutbacks in public spending on education) resulted in a decrease in the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The western region comprises five aimags: Bayan-Ulgii, Govi-Altai, Khovd, Uvs, and Zavkhan. Of the five, Govi-Altai, \nUvs, and Zavkhan aimags have been selected to develop and pilot models to improve the school dormitory \nenvironment because these aimags receive little regular support for dormitories from other development partners, \nand the aimag governments are highly committed to improving the physical dormitory environment and services. \n3  The net intake rate in grade 1 is expressed as new entrants in the first grade of primary education who are of the \nofficial school age (6 in Mongolia) as a percentage of the population of the same age. \n4  Mongolia is divided into  five  regions  and  21 aimags:  West  (Bayan-Ulgii,  Govi-Altai,  Khovd,  Uvs,  and Zavkhan \naimags),  Highlands  (Arkhangai,  Bayankhongor,  Bulgan,  Khuvsgul,  Orkhon,  and  Uvurkhangai  aimags),  Central \n(Darkhan-Uul, Dornogovi, Dundgovi, Govisumber, Selenge, Tuv and Umnugovi aimags), East (Dornod, Khentii, and \nSukhbaatar aimags), and Ulaanbaatar. Ulaanbaatar, the capital, is an independent municipality consisting of nine \ndistricts. \n5  State Great Hural (Parliament) of Mongolia. 1991. Education Law of Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar.  \n6  By 1986, the  gross  enrollment  ratio  reached  100%  at  the primary and 94% at the junior-secondary level, with \n74,967 students (18% of primary and secondary students) staying in 412 dormitories nationwide.  \n ", "2 \nnumber of students staying in dormitories,  and a drop in student enrollment in primary and \nsecondary  education. 7  Both  the  number  of  students  staying  in  dormitories  and  student \nenrollments increased considerably following resumption of full government financing of dormitory \nservices in 2000.8  \n \n5.  Chronically low levels of capital investment have resulted in deterioration of the physical \nenvironment of school dormitories. During 2013\u20132014, the number of dormitories decreased from \n511  to  486;  81  (17%)  did  not  meet  government  building  standards.  The  majority  of  these \ndormitories were built in the 1970s and 1980s, and have become unfit to accommodate students. \nAlthough public spending on education in Mongolia has been higher than in other lower-middle-\nincome countries, a large share has been devoted to covering the relatively high recurrent costs \nresulting from the country\u2019s low population density and harsh winters. Schools tend not to spend \nmoney on dormitories, because school budgets do not distinguish funding for dormitories from \nother budget items, except dormitory staff salaries and dormitory meals. As a result, dormitories \noften lack safe drinking water, adequate sanitation facilities, heating systems, and protection from \nprecipitation  and  wind.9 The  situation  surrounding  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene (WASH)  in \ndormitories is further complicated by the absence of basic infrastructure (for water, wastewater, \nand heating) in rural remote areas.  \n \n6.  Child-centered education sector reforms have yet to be applied to the school dormitory \nsystem. The current per-student funding formula for dormitory meals does not take into account \nthe age and differing nutritional requirements of students. Student\u2013teacher ratios in dormitories \nare generally  high (42\u201387),  and  students  engage  in  little  study,  reading,  and  extracurricular \nactivities in dormitories. Dormitory teachers are required to have a teacher\u2019s certification, but 30% \ndo not meet the requirement. Dormitory teachers are considered nonteaching staff, and receive \nlower salaries than do teaching staff, complicating the recruitment and retention of qualified \nindividuals. Many dormitory teachers and guards who stay with students in dormitories at night \nlack the skills needed to work and communicate with children.  A 2008 study indicated that \nstudents staying in dormitories have lower academic performance.10 \n \n7.  The western region is poor\u2014in 2012 the poverty head count ratio was 32.5%, above the \nnational average of 27.4%, with herders accounting for 41.9% of poor households. Of Mongolia\u2019s \nfive regions, the western region has the largest number of students staying in dormitories (11,691, \nor  14.3%  of  students  enrolled  in  primary  and  secondary  education  in  2014);  86%  of  these \nstudents are from herder families. In 2012, the region had a primary completion rate of 86.1%, the \nlowest in Mongolia and well below the national average of 94.5%. Children in the region tend to \nstart school later than the official school age of 6, as evidenced by the net intake rate in grade 1 \n(85.4% in 2014, which was the lowest in Mongolia, and below the national average of 90.5%). The \nsame study (footnote 10) shows that the academic performance of those who enter school at the \nage of 7 or 8 is lower than those who enter school at the age of 6. An unfavorable school \ndormitory  environment, compounded  by  other social  and safety  issues,  has  been the major \n                                                \n7  In 1995, the number of students staying in dormitories decreased to 18,867, while the gross enrollment ratios \ndropped to 87% at primary and 69% at junior secondary levels. \n8  In 2000, the number of students staying in dormitories increased to 27,435, and gross enrollment ratios recovered to \n98% at primary and 74% at junior secondary levels.  \n9  Many school dormitories in rural and remote areas are not connected to a piped water supply. Water is delivered daily \nby truck and stored in tanks, which are frequently unfit for drinking water storage, or unclean.   \n10 Education Evaluation Center of Mongolia. 2008.

Since 2012, the policy environment surrounding school dormitories has been changing. \nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MECS) has identified the learning environment, \nincluding the school dormitory system, as one of 11 areas of reforms to ensure equity of access to \nquality education under its education sector reform policy framework, 2012\u20132016.12 In 2015, the \nMECS  drafted  amendments to the  Education Law,  which  specify  improved  qualifications for \ndormitory  teachers,  and  the  role  of  local  governments  in  financing  dormitory  services.  In \ncollaboration with the Ministry of Health, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), the MECS also developed minimum requirements for WASH in schools \nand dormitories. The MECS further plans to develop comprehensive standards for dormitories, \nwhich would cover the physical dormitory environment and services (which have poorly been \nregulated), and a national strategy and financing policy to improve school dormitory environments, \nwith a focus on soum (district) schools, and greater involvement of local governments. To reform \nthe school dormitory system in the evolving policy environment, the MECS requested Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) support to develop and pilot models to improve the school dormitory \nenvironment, with a view to replicating the models nationwide. \n \n9.  Strategic fit. The project is consistent with the strategies in the ADB education sector \noperations plan to promote equity in education and reform education financing, and to provide \ncross-sector knowledge solutions.13 The project forms part of ADB\u2019s broader policy dialogue with \nthe government on education sector reforms to improve equity of access to quality education, \ntogether with the capacity development technical assistance to the MECS.14 The project is aligned \nwith  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132016  for  Mongolia,  which  provides  a \nrenewed focus on basic education.15 \n \n10.  Lessons. The project builds on the experience of ADB and other development partners in \nthe education sector, which indicate the need for comprehensive support to improve financial, \nhuman, and physical resources for dormitories. It also draws on good practices in boarding school \nmanagement in Japan and other countries where students are provided with additional learning \nopportunities, including reading and extracurricular activities. \n \n11.  Innovative features. The project will have innovative features, including (i) an inclusive \napproach incorporating elements responsive to gender, age, and special needs in terms of WASH \nfacility design and capacity building for dormitory staff, teachers, and school management; (ii) a \nfinancing policy to thus upgrade the school dormitory system; and (iii) a built-in impact evaluation \nthat  will  assess  effects  of  improved  physical  school  dormitory  environment  and  services  on \nstudent learning. \n \nB.   Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The impacts of the project will be a reformed school dormitory system, more equitable \naccess to quality education (footnote 13), and achievement of universal primary education.16 The \n                                                \n11 Other social and safety issues include parents\u2019 attitude toward children\u2019s education, children\u2019s first impression of  \nschools and dormitories, and potential bullying, child and sexual abuse at dormitories.  \n12 MECS. 2012.

Outputs \n \n13.  The project will have three outputs: \n \n14.  Output 1: Physical school dormitory environment improved. The project will improve \nthe  physical  school  dormitory  environment  by  supporting  minor  civil  works  for  soum  school \ndormitories in the Govi-Altai, Uvs, and Zavkhan aimags of the western region, which have been \nidentified as in need of upgrading, based on the condition of dormitory buildings and facilities, the \nyear of dormitory construction and/or rehabilitation, the number of primary students staying in \ndormitories,  the  existence  of  junior  and  senior  secondary  grades,  and  the  lack  of  basic \ninfrastructure (water, wastewater, and heating). Minor civil works will include rehabilitation of \nbuildings to adequately cope with winter temperatures, wind, and precipitation; repair and/or \ninstallation of universal-design WASH facilities that meet minimum requirements (including those \nrelated to gender and early grade students) developed by the MECS in collaboration with the \nMinistry of Health, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and NGOs; provision of beds and other \nfurniture to accommodate more students; and renovation of common rooms that will be properly \nfurnished for study, reading, and extracurricular activities. \n \n15.  Output 2: Capacity to deliver school dormitory services improved. The project will \nsupport  capacity  development  of  school  dormitory  staff  and  primary  class  teachers,  school \nmanagement and accountants, and aimag education department staff to improve school dormitory \nservices for primary students staying in dormitories and their parents in Govi-Altai, Uvs, and \nZavkhan aimags. All school dormitories in the three aimags will be supported. School dormitory \nteachers will be trained in child abuse issues and child-centered methods to facilitate study, \nreading, and extracurricular activities; and improve school preparedness of students, especially in \nthe early grades. Dormitory guards will receive training regarding child abuse and child-centered \ncommunication to encourage study, reading, and extracurricular activities; and enable them to \ncare for dormitory students, especially in early grades, at night. School staff involved in the \npreparation of dormitory meals will receive training concerning the nutritional requirements of \nstudents, while school management, accountants, and aimag education department staff will be \ntrained to use tools and reference materials to enhance management of financial, human and \nphysical resources for school dormitories. Workshops will be organized for school dormitory \nteachers,  primary  class  teachers,  and  social  workers  to  exchange  experiences  regarding             \n(i) student- and teacher-organized study, reading, and extracurricular activities at dormitories; and \n(ii) communication and outreach activities for parents of primary students staying in dormitories. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  improve  the  school  dormitory \nenvironment  developed.  The project will support the development of policy and regulatory \nframeworks  to  improve  the  school  dormitory  environment.  Comprehensive  standards  for \ndormitories, covering the physical dormitory environment and services, will be developed based \non (i) the models to improve the physical dormitory environment and services, which are to be \nestablished and implemented in the three aimags of the western region; and (ii) national and \ninternational  good  practices  in  boarding  school  management  in  Japan  and  other  countries. \nFunding formulas for school dormitory meals will be revised to take into account the age and \nnutritional requirements of students. To enable replication of the models nationwide, a national \nstrategy and financing policy will be developed (i) to improve the school dormitory environment, \nparticularly at soum schools with a greater involvement by local governments; and (ii) with due \nconsideration for the hiring and recruitment of qualified dormitory teachers, and operation and \n ", "    5 \nmaintenance of the physical dormitory environment. An impact evaluation study will be conducted \nto inform the nationwide replication of the models. \n \n17.  To ensure sustainability, the project will support the establishment of an effective project \nmanagement  system  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  MECS  and  aimag  education \ndepartments, and ensuring their coordination for project implementation and management.  \n \nD.

The PIU will be staffed by a project \nmanager,  a  procurement  specialist,  and  an  accountant  and/or  financial \nmanagement specialist to be based in Ulaanbaatar. The PIU will be further \nstaffed and supported by three local project coordinators in Govi-Altai, Uvs, and \nZavkhan aimag education departments. \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  10\u201320 contracts  $1,800,000 \n  Shopping  8 contracts  $168,000 \nConsulting services  Consultant\u2019s qualifications  36 person-months  $100,000 \nselectiona \n  Individual consultants selectionb  59 person-months  $363,000 \n ", "    7 \nAspects   Arrangements \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting for a national engineering firm will be conducted. \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MECS = Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science; NGO = nongovernment \norganization; PIU = project implementation unit.  \n a A national engineering firm will be recruited using the consultant\u2019s qualifications selection method on the grounds that \nhighly specialized expertise is required, recruitment time is critical and the assignment is short-term, few consultants \nare qualified, and the process of preparing and evaluating competitive proposals is unjustified. \nb  A total of 13 consultants will be engaged using the individual consultants selection method because collective \nresponsibility is not needed, while individual experience and qualifications are the main requirements.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.   Technical  \n \n21.  The  project  will  improve  the  physical  environment  of  school  dormitories.  Dormitory \nbuildings and rooms will be rehabilitated to adequately cope with winter temperatures, wind, and \nprecipitation in accordance with national regulations, standards, and codes. Selected WASH \nfacility  models  will  be  (i)  compatible  with  available  infrastructure  for  basic  services  (water, \nwastewater,  and  heating)  and  winter  temperatures  on  site;  (ii)  easy  to  maintain;  and                     \n(iii) responsive to gender, age, and special needs. Beds and other furniture to be supplied will be \nsafe for students, especially in early grades, and durable. Capacity-building activities for teachers, \ndormitory staff, and school management, as well as study, reading, and extracurricular activities \nfor dormitory students and parent involvement in education, have been designed to incorporate \ninternational  and  national  good  practices  (e.g.,  school-based  continuous  professional \ndevelopment, teacher collaboration and involvement of local communities, and communication \nand outreach activities for parents of students in dormitories who reside in remote rural areas). \n \nB.   Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The economic rationale of the project was assessed as sound, because the project will \nincrease the availability of improved school dormitory services to ensure access to 9 years of free \ncompulsory education in the western region, which has the largest unmet demand for dormitory \nservices, and where dormitory services have increasingly become unaffordable for children from \npoor herder families. The project cost-effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the average \ninvestment cost per dormitory for three project alternatives (i.e., project case, with construction of \na new building, and without school-based continuous capacity building) and their anticipated \nimpacts on student learning. The project case was assessed as the least-cost and most effective \noption as it would consolidate different types of investments and have the lowest maintenance \ncost. The project is considered economically viable and sustainable. \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. The financial sustainability of the project was assessed at the \nfiscal  and  project  levels.  An  analysis  of recent  and  projected government  expenditures  was \nundertaken to evaluate the potential impact of the project on the budgets of the MECS, and the \nGovi-Altai, Uvs, and Zavkhan aimag governments. The MECS and aimag governments\u2019 annual \ncommitments to the project are considered adequate, because they are estimated to be less than \n0.1%  of  their  total  annual  budgets  as  described  in  detail  in  the  financial  analysis.18 The \n                                                \n18 Paragraph 9 of Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "8 \ngovernment has assured that sufficient budgets for operations and maintenance will be provided \nas set forth in the grant agreement.  \n \nC.   Governance \n \n24.  The project procurement risk was classified as category B. The procurement risk for the \nMECS has been assessed as moderate because of weaknesses in staffing of the procurement \nunit of the MECS and the PIU, and procurement practices. These risks will be mitigated by \nengaging the Government Procurement Agency of Mongolia in evaluating bids for civil works to \nbe  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding,  and  recruiting  a  qualified  and  experienced \nprocurement specialist to the PIU. The specialist will be supported by consultants who specialize \nin preparing drawings and design specifications of and supervising minor civil works, preparing \ntechnical specifications of equipment and furniture, and managing projects. All procurement under \nthe project will be carried out by the MECS, and coordinated by the PIU.   \n \n25.  The financial management risk for the MECS has been assessed as moderate due to \nweaknesses identified in staffing, safeguard over assets, and internal audit at the MECS. To \naddress  these  risks,  the  key  mitigating  measures  include  training  for  the  MECS,  and  the \neducation  departments  of  Govi-Altai,  Uvs,  and  Zavkhan  aimags;  and  strengthening  of  their \ncapacity  through  the  PIU.  The  PIU  will  be  staffed  by  qualified  professionals,  including  an \naccountant  and/or  financial  management  specialist,  a  project  manager,  and  local  project \ncoordinators in the aimag education departments; and guided and coached by an international \nproject management specialist to ensure that the project is implemented in compliance with ADB \npolicy, operational, and procedural requirements. Project assets will be appropriately labeled and \nrecorded, and reported in quarterly and annual project reports. Annual project audits will be \narranged by the National Audit Office. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MECS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nD.   Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The project will directly benefit about 3,900 primary students staying in dormitories in Govi-\nAltai, Uvs, and Zavkhan aimags, including about 2,000 early grade students, the majority of whom \ncome from poor herder families and who face barriers and challenges in learning because of the \nunfavorable physical dormitory environment and services, and lack of parental support. Because \nof concerns with the dormitory environment, mothers often have to move closer to schools to live \nwith young children, or children are left in a ger (traditional tent) set up close to the school without \nan adult caregiver. Currently, less than 30% of primary students in dormitories regularly engage in \nstudy, reading, and extracurricular activities at dormitories, which is probably the result of the high \nstudent\u2013teacher  ratios  in  dormitories,  and  lack  of  qualifications  and  skills  among  dormitory \nteachers and staff. Only 20%\u201330% of parents of primary students in dormitories participate in \nmeetings and events organized by schools to familiarize them with their children\u2019s learning. \n \n28.  Gender benefits. The project is designed to effectively mainstream gender. In 2014, the \noverall primary-level gender parity index in Govi-Altai, Uvs, and Zavkhan aimags averaged 0.96, \nwhile that for primary students staying in dormitories was 0.79, suggesting that the dormitory \nenvironment is potentially less favorable for female than for male students. Many dormitories in \nrural remote areas are not connected to water supply, sewerage and heating systems, and have \nonly  rudimentary  pit  toilets  outside  dormitory  buildings,  raising  safety  issues  (particularly  for \n ", "    9 \nfemale students). A social, ethnic, and gender action plan (SEGAP) has been developed to \naddress  poverty,  social  inclusion,  gender,  and  ethnicity  issues.  The  SEGAP  ensures  (i)  the \ncollection of disaggregated data\u2014by grade, gender, family background (e.g., ethnicity or herder), \nand poverty status\u2014for planning, monitoring, and evaluation; (ii) inclusion of issues related to \nearly grade, female, herder, and ethnic group students at dormitories, including child and sexual \nabuse issues, in training sessions and materials; (iii) participation of female teachers, dormitory \nstaff,  school  management,  accountants,  and  aimag  education  department  staff  in  capacity \ndevelopment activities; (iv) participation of early grade, female, herder and ethnic group students \nin student- and teacher-organized study, reading, and extracurricular activities at dormitories; and                  \n(v) inclusion of mothers and female caregivers in communication and outreach activities for \nparents. \n \nE.   Safeguards \n \n29.  Environment. The project is classified as category C for the environment, and low climate \nrisk.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  and  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s  regulatory  framework.  A  generic \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared that identifies all potential minor \nadverse impacts of repair and extension works and related mitigation measures, and defines \ninstitutional responsibilities for environmental management planning, construction supervision and \nmonitoring, grievance redress, and reporting. The generic EMP will guide proper environmental \nmanagement throughout the design and rehabilitation of dormitory buildings, the repair and/or \ninstallation of WASH facilities, and their sustainable operations and maintenance.  \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as C for \ninvoluntary resettlement as it will not require any permanent and/or temporary land acquisition or \nresettlement. All minor civil works will be accommodated within the existing premises, avoiding \nland acquisition and/or resettlement. The project is categorized as B for indigenous peoples, \nbecause one of the project sites, Uvs aimag, is the home of the Dorvord, Bayad, Eljigen, Khalkh, \nand Khoton ethnic groups that live a seminomadic life. The needs and concerns of these ethnic \ngroups were assessed, as well as those of herder families. The assessment confirmed that ethnic \ngroups and herder families will not be negatively impacted, but do face additional barriers and \nchallenges to being integrated into the education system because of their customs, dialects, and \ntraditional  lifestyles.  Measures  to  enhance  inclusiveness,  sensitivity,  and  maximize  project \nbenefits for the ethnic groups and herder families have been incorporated into the project SEGAP. \nThe  Uvs  aimag  education  department  has  disclosed  and  undertaken  consultations  on  the \nSEGAP.  \n \nF.   Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.19 The overall risk was rated medium.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe priority of the aimag (province)  Inform  and  involve  major  stakeholders  in  planning,  monitoring,  and \ngovernments shifts away from school  evaluating  the  project  through  the  project  steering  subcommittees \ndormitories, adversely affecting the  established in each aimag.  \navailability of financial resources \nFrequent turnover of dormitory staff,  Support school-based continuous professional development for dormitory \nschool management, accountants, and  staff, and develop reference materials and tools for school management, \naimag education department staff who  accountants, and aimag education department staff (such as school-\nwere trained to provide improved services  based, easy-to-use resource management manuals) \nand manage financial, human, and \nphysical resources for school dormitories \nLimited experience of the MECS staff in  Establish a PIU staffed by qualified and experienced professionals to \ndirectly managing donor funds, causing  assume day-to-day management of the project in compliance with ADB \ndelays in project implementation   policy, operational, and procedural requirements; engage an international \nproject management specialist to train, guide, and coach the MECS, the \naimag education departments, and the PIU \nNo procedures are in place to safeguard  Label and record all project assets, and report on them in quarterly and \nassets, causing loss of project assets  annual project reports \nUnderstaffed and compliance-driven  Review transactions and financial reports during review missions; and \ninternal audit functions of the MECS,  engage an international project management specialist to train, guide, and \nleading to risks for project implementation  coach the MECS and PIU staff on ADB guidelines and procedures \nand completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MECS = Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science; PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
