The environmental impact of the proposed Project \nis expected to be insignificant.  \n \nThe  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  is  designed  to \nfacilitate  knowledge  and \ninformation  acquisition,  and \ninstitutional  support  mechanisms,  with  the  overall  aim  of \nexpanding  employment  opportunities,  and  enhancing \nthe \ncompetitiveness  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs)  in \nrural areas on a sustainable basis. \n \nPakistan  depends  substantially  on  agriculture  and  other  rural \nactivities to provide livelihoods for the majority of its population. \nFor  Pakistan  to  meet  its  goal  of  reducing  poverty  by  half  by \n2015, and also to reduce rapid rural-urban migration, nonfarm \neconomic  opportunities  in  rural  areas  need  to  expand.  The \ncountry  has  around  150,000  small  businesses  and  more  than \nthree million microenterprises. The informal economy is largely \nunregulated and faces crucial resource constraints, particularly \nfinance,  skills,  new \ntechnology  and  knowledge,  and \nmanagement.  Access  to  finance,  improved  technology,  and \npotential  new  markets  and  average  standards  of  quality  and \nlow.  The  business \nproduct  uniformity  are  especially \nenvironment  in  the  informal  sector  is  often  difficult  and \noccasionally  chaotic.  Since  more  than  90%  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nbusinesses  are  in  this  sector,  there  is  enormous  need  to \nincrease  factor  productivity.  Despite  some  success,  however, \nmany  initiatives  have  been  constrained  by  a  variety  of  social, \ninstitutional,  and  political  factors.  What  is  required  in  view  of \nthe  problems  mentioned  is  an  innovative  approach  that  works \noutside conventional institutions, and draws on lessons learned \nand \nthe \nto \ncompetitiveness of rural and peri-urban MSEs. \n \n\ninternational \n\npractices, \n\nimprove \n\nbest \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nidentifying  and \n\nThe  designed  impact  of  the  TA  loan  is  to  create  and  diversify  \njob  and  income-earning  opportunities  in  the  rural  areas \nespecially  for  the  landless,  wage  earners,  and  women.  The \nintended  outcome  is  to  develop  market  facilitation  processes \nfilling  market  gaps  within  selected \nby \nsubsectors in rural and peri-urban areas, and strengthening the \ncompetitiveness  of  the  target  groups.  Steps  will  be  taken  to \ndesign  innovative  institutional  arrangements  and  assess  the \nfeasibility  of  establishing  a  not-for-profit  company  to  catalyze \nbusiness development services and introduce best practices in \nenhancing  social  and  environmental  processes  in  support  of \nthe growth of rural businesses. \n \nThe estimated project cost is $6.5 million equivalent, including \nphysical and price contingencies, duties and taxes, and interest \nand  service  charges  during \nforeign \nexchange cost is estimated at $2.6 million, or 40% of the total \ncost.

Vehicles, \nequipment, and materials will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding if they cost more than $500,000 equivalent, \nor  by  international  shopping  if  they  cost  from  $100,000  to \n$500,000 equivalent. \n \nConsulting  services  are  required  for  technical  inputs  and \nproject management. A pool of consultants will be provided to \nsupport the TA components. The TA loan will provide flexibility \nin  recruiting  domestic  and  international  institutions  for  the \ndesign,  marketing,  and  technology  transfer  services,  and  in \nmeeting social and environmental safeguards. The TA loan will \nprovide  an  estimated  108  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  218  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.  \n \nThe  direct  benefits  will  flow  from  increased  employment  and \nincome-earning opportunities in the rural areas, particularly for \nwage  earners,  women,  and  poor  producer  groups  with  the \npotential  to  engage  in  a  higher  level  of  commercial  activity. \nThese developments will be a consequence of addressing the \nmarket  gaps  and \nin  selected  subsectors,  and \nstrengthening  the  competitive  position  of  the  micro-  and  small \nbusinesses  operating  within  those  subsectors.  It  is  expected \nthat  through  these  measures  there  will  be  increased  value \naddition  in  the  products  sold,  improved  commercial  linkages \nbetween  rural  MSEs  and  the  larger  urban  businesses,  and \nincreased demand for goods and services.   \n \n\nfailures \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nfar \n\nsteering \n\nto  markets.  So \n\nThe  project  design  makes  a  number  of  assumptions  with \nassociated  risks.  It  is  assumed  that  the  Government  remains \nstrongly  committed  to  improving  the  market  opportunities  and \ncompetitiveness of rural enterprises, especially those that now \nthe  Government  has \nlack  access \ndemonstrated  strong  ownership  and  commitment  through  a \nfocus  on  addressing  constraints  in  market  access  in  the  rural \nareas.  It  is  recognized  that  the  project  design  will  require  a \nknowledge-intensive  approach,  with  a  high  degree  of \nresponsiveness  to  emerging  market  opportunities.  In  addition, \nthere is a need to work with a number of institutions both within \nand  outside  the  government.  Extensive  consultations  with  all \nstakeholders,  including  the  private  sector,  and  high-level \ngovernment support if not realized could delay the Project and \nlimit  understanding  and  development  of \nthe  appropriate \ninstitutional processes required to support the competitiveness \nof rural enterprises. This risk is addressed through the creation \nof  a  high-level \ncommittee  with  adequate \nrepresentation from the Government and the private sector. In \naddition,   the Project provides flexibility in engaging the private \nsector    and    other    stakeholders  in  all  undertakings,  and  on-\ntime availability of a  range of  consultants  with   demonstrated \ntechnical  knowledge  and  international  experience  to  analyze \nthe  subsectors  and  design  initiatives  that  respond  to  market \nopportunities  in  the  rural  areas.  The  need  to  stimulate \nimprovements  in  design  and  quality  and  to  ensure  social \ncompliance with labor laws, etc., among the rural enterprises is \naddressed \nthrough  comprehensive  subsector  analysis, \ninterventions  with \nfollowed  by  carefully  designed  pilot \nappropriate  social  safeguards  and  processes  and  private \nsector linkages. The results of this subsector analysis and the \npilot  interventions  will  in  turn  inform  the  business  plan  to  be \nprepared for the establishment of an institution that will support \nthe  development  of  business  opportunities \nrural \nentrepreneurs.  This  sequencing  of \nimplementation  gives \nadequate  focus  to  preparing  relevant  area-  and  product-\nspecific  strategies  for  promoting  business  development,  and \nminimizes the risk that the institution that is set up might fail to \nbe  socially  responsive, sustainable,  and  relevant  to  the  needs \nof the underserved rural entrepreneurs.    \n\nfor \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Rural  Enterprise \nModernization Project. The design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIn  South  Asia  as  a  whole,  the  nonfarm  economy  accounts  for  roughly  25%  of  rural \nemployment  and  29%  of  rural  incomes.1 Seasonal  trading,  agro-processing,  manufacturing,  and \nservice  activities  enhance  rural  livelihoods,  support  a  growing  agriculture,  and  supply  consumer \ngoods and services. Nonfarm activity offers important economic opportunities for the rural poor in \nareas where landlessness is high. Pakistan\u2019s population is 68% rural and agriculture accounts for \nalmost 45% of total employment. Outside the agriculture sector, 46% of the rural poor (and 22% of \nthe rural population) are nonfarm households that do not share directly in incomes derived from \nagricultural  crop  production.  Despite  declining  rural  poverty  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  poverty \nremained high in the 1990s. Real growth in agriculture declined to an average annual rate of 2.4% \nwith  sharp  year-to-year  fluctuations  from  1990  to  2002,  compared  with  the  overall  rate  of  3.5% \nachieved  from  1960  onward.  The  yields  of  the  major  crops  have  largely  stagnated  in  the  past \ndecade. The percentage of the rural poor living below the poverty line was essentially unchanged \nbetween  1990  (36.9%)  and  1999  (35.9%),  and  even  rose  to  38.9%  in  2002,  a  drought  year.  If \nPakistan is to meet its goal of reducing poverty by half by 2015, rural economic opportunities must \nexpand in agriculture and the nonfarm sector. In the absence of a change in the structure of rural \nincomes  and  employment,  growth  in  traditional  crop  agriculture  and  associated  growth  linkages \nmay  not  be  adequate  to  substantially  raise  the  incomes  of  the  rural  nonfarm  poor  households. \nStrategies  to  promote  rural  nonfarm  income  opportunities  are  therefore  necessary  to  make  an \nimpact on rural poverty in Pakistan.  \n \n3. \nIn many areas of rural development, Pakistan lags behind its Asian neighbors with fewer \nnatural  resources.  Drought  and  the  poor  performance  of  crops  and  livestock  often  force  rural \npeople to migrate at least temporarily to the cities. This situation is exacerbated by the system \nof landholding, which is characterized by a high degree of land concentration by ownership and \nby a high incidence of sharecropping tenure in the two most populous provinces of Sindh and \nPunjab. Cities like Karachi with a population of around 14 million are increasingly ill-equipped to \nhandle the concomitant problems of overcrowding and pressure on the urban infrastructure and \nenvironment. The urban population grew from 24 million in 1981 to 53 million in 2005. Hence, \nthere  is  a  pressing  need  (also  found  in  other  Asian  countries)  to  seek  nontraditional  work \nopportunities  in  rural  areas.  Efforts  must  therefore  be  made  to  diversify  the  rural  economy  in \nnonfarm  sectors  such  as  services,  small-scale  manufacturing,  and  value-added  agricultural \nprocessing. The proposed TA loan targets rural and peri-urban enterprises that have potential \nfor  labor-intensive  growth  if  provided  with  synergistic  support  by  a  range  of  private  sector, \nnongovernment, and public sector partners. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   International  Food  Policy  Research  Institute.  2002.  Strategies  for  Stimulating  Poverty-alleviating  Growth  in  the \n\nRural Nonfarm Economy in Developing Countries. Washington, D.C. (July). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems Faced by Rural Enterprises \n\nPakistan  has  around  150,000  small  businesses  and  more \n\n \nthan  3  million \n4. \nmicroenterprises,  which  together  compose  more  than  90%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  businesses. \nMany  of  the  micro-  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs)  are  in  rural  areas  and  depend  heavily  on \nagricultural  raw  materials  and  poorly  skilled  nonfarm  labor.  Rural  businesses  face  difficulty  in \naccessing a range of essential financial and business development services (BDS).2 Access to \nfinance and improved technology and average  standards of quality and product uniformity are \nespecially low. More importantly, challenges are posed by (i) the generally low level of literacy, \nparticularly  among  women;  (ii)  poor  business  management  practices;  and  (iii)  reluctance  or \nlimited  capacity  to  adopt  more  modern  technology  and  practices,  and  to  take  on  new \ncommercial  risks.  Entrenched  linguistic  and  ethnic  differences  provide  further  obstacles  to \ninvestment in nonfarm activities that cross provincial or tribal boundaries. \n \nThe  MSE  business  environment  is  influenced,  by,  among  others,  infrastructure,  social \n5. \nrelationships,  energy  costs  and  reliability,  and  increasing  competition  from  modern  urban \nbusinesses  and  imports,  which  pose  tough  challenges  in  niche  and  mass  markets.  These \nfactors translate into underdeveloped rural nonfarm enterprises and cottage industries, and loss \nof  opportunities  for  employment  growth  and  added  market  value.  The  status  of  selected  rural \nindustries is presented in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \nPrivate  businesses,  including  MSEs  and  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  are  the \n6. \nprimary  target  groups  of  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  promote  growth  through  economic \ndiversification.  This  is  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Framework, \nwhich aims, among others, to facilitate the development of human capital and the private sector \nas  engines  of  economic  growth.  Finalized  in  July  2005,  the  framework  recognizes  the  need  to \nincrease  factor  productivity  through  technology-led  human  resource  development  that  builds \ncapacity for innovation and leverages local knowledge. This vision will require a combined effort to \nadd to the human resource base via a range of interventions, including bringing more women into \nthe  labor  force,  increasing  skill  levels,  and  combining  these  skills  with  better  infrastructure  and \ntechnology. With this broad strategy in mind, Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Country Strategy \nand  Program  (2006\u20132008)  notes  ADB\u2019s  role  in  promoting  the  private  sector  as  a  driver  of \ninvestment,  growth,  and  employment  generation.  The  proposed  TA  loan  is  the  third  innovative \nADB effort to support the Government\u2019s objective of private sector\u2013led enterprise development.3 \n \n7. \nFormal  financial  sector  lending  to  rural  MSEs/SMEs  is  very  low,  but  this  is  being \naddressed by the Government and is expected to improve gradually. Data relating specifically to \nrural MSEs are limited, but in the SME sector only about 5% of some 50,000 enterprises with \n                                                 \n2  BDS  encompass  a  range  of  services  that  enhance  market  access,  technology  and  product  development,  quality \n\nPolicy Initiatives and Rural Finance Programs in Pakistan  \n\n2. \n\nstandards, accounting, and information and communication technology. \n\n3   The others are the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SMESDP), approved in December \n2003,  and  the  Agribusiness  Development  Project  (ADP),  approved  in  May  2005.  SMESDP  will  enhance  the \neffectiveness  and  outreach  of  the  SME  Development  Authority  (SMEDA),  established  in  the  late  1990s  to  assist \nsmall businesses. The focus of SMEDA is mainly urban and on enterprises larger in size than the MSEs targeted \nunder this TA loan. SMESDP will improve the access of SMEs to BDS via a Business Support Fund, and assist in \nrationalizing  small  business  financing  through  the  SME  Bank.  ADP  is  intended  to  remove  constraints  in  the  value \nchain  and  improve  grading  and  standards,  seed  testing  and  certification,  and  market  information.  ADP  provides \ntraining and support for innovation through the Agribusiness Support Fund, with a primary focus on horticulture and \nlivestock, which show potential for value addition through small commercial enterprises. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nless  than  five  employees  receive  funding  from  formal  financial  institutions.  Commercial  banks \nand mainstream financial institutions remain focused on corporate urban clients, and only very \nlately have some financial institutions begun to explore small businesses as an attractive niche, \nalthough  the  focus  remains  on  urban  areas.  The  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (SMESDP)  and  the  Agribusiness  Development  Project  (ADP),  both \nfunded by ADB, provide support to commercial banks and rural finance institutions to enhance \ntheir outreach to SMEs. These efforts focus on (i) improving SME creditworthiness; (ii) reducing \nthe perceived level of risk faced by financial institutions in lending to SMEs; and (iii) enhancing \nthe  capacity  of  financial  institutions  to  identify  new  lending  opportunities,  and  to  appraise  and \nsupervise SME loans. \n \n8. \nSerious  impetus  for  developing  microfinance\u2014which  presents  the  main  medium-term \noption for many MSEs to access financial services\u2014came in the late 1990s as the sector came \nto  be  regarded  as  an  important  strategic  instrument  for  addressing  rising  poverty  in  Pakistan. \nComprehensive policy regulations, including the Microfinance Ordinance 2002, were formulated. \nThe credit and savings program of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) evolved into \nthe  First  Microfinance  Bank,  and  led  to  the  subsequent  establishment  of  the  Khushali  Bank \nunder  the  ADB-financed  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program. 4  With  an  increase  in \nborrowers  from  100,000  in  1999  to  more  than  400,000  in  2004,  and  a  gross  loan  portfolio  of \nPRs4.5 billion, the microfinance sector has grown rapidly in recent years. Although less than 6% \nof the market is now being served, it is projected that by 2009 the number of active borrowers \nwill rise to 2.9 million.5 \n \n\n3. \n\nSmall Nonfarm Enterprise Development in Rural Asia \n\n \n9. \nIn Asia as a whole, rural nonfarm growth has been fastest in countries having a dynamic \nagriculture,  rapid  urban-industrial  growth,  requisite  managerial  and  labor  skills,  ready  markets \nfor  inputs  (including  financing)  and  outputs,  and  good  basic  infrastructure  (roads,  power,  and \ncommunications). A central feature of Asia\u2019s rural nonfarm growth is that it has been led almost \nentirely  by  the  market  and  the  private  sector.  Public  sector  efforts  to  directly  organize  rural \nindustry and business have generally not succeeded on a broad scale. \n \nBesides  ADB  and  AKRSP,  support  for  private  enterprise  development  in  Pakistan  has \n10. \nbeen provided by the World Bank, bilateral donors including the Swiss Agency for Development \nand  Cooperation,  and  a  range  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  (Appendix  3).  More \nbroadly, rural MSE/SME efforts in the Asian region have included both public and private sector \n(profit oriented) initiatives. In 1998\u20132000, the Committee of Donor Agencies for Small Enterprise \nDevelopment\u2014in  which  ADB  participated\u2014organized  a  series  of  international  and  regional \nconferences that led to an emerging consensus on principles for donor interventions in BDS.6 The \nBDS market development paradigm is based on the principle that achieving economic and social \ngoals  is  possible  only  by  relying  on  private  sector  actors  to  provide  a  diverse  array  of  services. \nRelying  on  the  private  sector  requires  understanding  how  BDS  providers  can  be  financially \nself-sustaining.  The  design  of  the  TA  loan  reflects  the  experience  gained  in  the  major  rural \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nIslamic Repubic of Pakistan for the Microfinance Sector Development Program. Manila \n\n5   Microfinance in Pakistan: Innovating and Mainstreaming, an international conference in December 2004. \n6   The  Committee  of  Donor  Agencies  for  Small  Enterprise  Development  was  established  in  October  1979  at  a \nmeeting  convened  in  Berlin  at  the  invitation  of  the  World  Bank.  Bilateral  and  multilateral  donor  organizations \nengaged in the development of small-scale enterprises in developing countries were represented. The participants \nagreed  that  supporting  small  enterprise  development  was  a  rapidly  growing  area  of  interest  and  that  closer \ncontacts  among  organizations  would  help  harmonize  approaches  and  prevent  confusion  arising  from  differing \ninterventions.   \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nbusiness  promotion  initiatives  and  different  approaches  to  job  creation  and  employment \ngeneration in  Pakistan, including  AKRSP, and  programs supported  by  other donors  and  NGOs. \nThe lessons also draw on the wider international experience and emerging best practices in small \nbusiness development (Appendix 4). \n \n\na. \n\nMechanisms for Program Delivery/Institutional Models \n\nThe following section provides a summary of program delivery mechanisms for providing \n\n \n11. \nbusiness development services to MSEs/SMEs. \n \n\nUnder  SMESDP,  ADB  has  actively  engaged  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Authority  (SMEDA)  in  reorienting  its  BDS  approach.  As  a  result, \nSMEDA  has  started  to  move  away  from  direct  intervention  in  SME  training  and \npreparation  of  business  plans  to  a  more  facilitative  role.  Additional  impetus  to \nthese  efforts  will  come  from  the  Business  Support  Fund  (BSF),  which  upon  its \nestablishment will improve market-based SME access to BDS. Despite adequate \nplanning and consultations during the preparation of SMESDP, the establishment \nof  BSF  has  taken  more  time  than  expected.  From  experience,  innovative \ninitiatives  involving  a  new  and  diverse  set  of  stakeholders  require  adequate \nplanning  and  support  for  public  sector  consensus  building  to  ensure  that  the \ninitiative can take off. \nPublic  funds  should  be  used  for  developing  markets  rather  than  individual \nbusinesses,  so  that  more  target  commercial  stakeholders  can  benefit.  Publicly \nfunded  programs  should  therefore  focus  on  market  growth  and  address  market \ngaps and failures to the advantage of the target business groups. The programs \nshould not directly deliver services to small enterprises, since that would be cost-\nineffective and would limit outreach, would not be sustainable in the long run, and \nwould lead to supply-led rather than demand-driven services. \nDirect  interactions  between  publicly  funded  programs  and  small  businesses  are \nbased on an unequal relationship if the latter cannot hold the former accountable \nfor the quality and range of the services provided. These interactions should be \nmutually accountable, businesslike, and transaction-based. \nBusinesses  should  be  established  in  the  private  sector  by  entrepreneurs  taking \nthe  lead,  not  publicly  funded  organizations,  since  the  latter  would  displace \ncompetition and private sector initiative. More importantly, the financial discipline \nand vigilance that comes with investing equity or taking recourse to debt augurs \nwell for the profitability of a business and the careful calculation of risks that the \nentrepreneur must make. \nBusinesses  established  with  cost-free  donor  money  and  housed  in  social \ndevelopment  organizations  are  undermined  by  inherent  conflicts  between  the \nsocial  development  goals  of  the  organization  and  the  profit  motive  and \ncommercial competitiveness of the business. \n\nb. \n\nFocus of Interventions \n\n \n12. \non a competitive basis are listed in the following section. \n \n\nA suggested menu of approaches to target focused interventions for MSE development \n\nMSE  development  must  be  considered  in  the  context  of  the  commercial  and \nsocial  milieu,  not  in  isolation  from  it.  Otherwise,  efforts  will  not  address  the \nfundamental  constraints  of  disconnection  from  demand,  innovation,  knowledge, \ntechnology, competition, and efficiencies present in the formal sector. The latter \n\n(i) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nis  an  invaluable  repository  of  technical  and  managerial  skills  for  small \nbusinesses,  which  can  in  turn  enable  large  businesses  to  minimize  overhead \ncosts through outsourcing.  \nProgrammatic  interventions  of  publicly  funded  development  programs  should  be \ntime-bound, i.e., designed with exit strategies in mind so that the sustainability of \nimpact is considered right from the start of the intervention. \nThe  problem  for  small  businesses  is  not  just  marketing  and  design,  but \nunderstanding  whether  producing  what  consumers  want  is  financially  and \ntechnically  feasible.  Frequently,  too  many  resources  are  spent  trying  to  market \nexisting  products,  rather  than  understanding  what  different  consumer  segments \nwant, and whether the target business groups have the potential capacity to meet \nthose demands. \ntap.  The  required \nExport  markets  are  very  competitive  and  difficult \nstandardization,  high  volume,  and  quality  at  competitive  prices  are  not  easily \naccomplished by rural enterprises. \nProduct  innovation  initiatives  should  be  (a)  based  on  holistic  market  research \nabout what will be required at the production, marketing, sales, and management \nlevels; and (b) guided by whether it is within the existing or potential capacity of the \ntarget business groups to compete profitably. All of these should be driven by the \nkinds of products different consumers want. \nDirect  subsidies  should  be  avoided.  Where  deemed  necessary,  they  must  have \nclear objectives, be time-bound, with terms and expectations clearly understood by \nthe recipients. Otherwise, it is difficult to wean businesses away from free services, \ndependency is created, and the commercial market for BDS is distorted. \n\nto \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  TA  loan  is  to  create  and  diversify  job  and  income-earning \nopportunities  in  the  Project  area,  particularly  for  the  landless,  wage  earners,  and  women.  The \npurpose  is  to  develop  market  facilitation  processes  by  identifying  and  strengthening  market  gaps \nwithin selected subsectors Project area, and enhance the competitiveness of the target groups by \nfacilitating access to a range of BDS, including appropriate technologies and financial capital. The \nTA  loan  will  help  analyze  opportunities  in  designing  innovative  institutional  arrangements  and \nassess the feasibility of establishing a not-for-profit company that would serve as a focal point for \ninitiatives to support the development and growth of rural businesses. Initiatives under the TA loan \nwill be aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of small businesses by enabling them to improve \nthe  quality,  standardization,  volume,  and  value  addition  of  their  products,  and  to  serve  more \neffectively a larger consumer base and niche markets. Rural enterprise modernization will also entail \nincreasing awareness among MSEs about BDS and related social and environmental safeguards, \nand  identifying  and  enabling  access  by  rural  businesses  to  a  range  of  appropriate  BDS, \ntechnologies, and  financing,  all customized to  match  rural  MSE  absorptive  capacity  and business \npotential.  The  TA  loan  embodies  a  three-pronged  strategy:  (i)  identify  key  opportunities  for  local, \nnonfarm rural growth; (ii) focus on subsector-specific supply chains and constraints on expansion; \nand (iii) build diverse, flexible coalitions among partners that have interest in achieving results. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe  TA  loan  will  (i)  fill  major  gaps  in  information  and  analysis  on  rural  nonfarm  MSEs \nand  consolidate  this  information  in  a  knowledge  management  system;  (ii)  identify  and  initiate \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ncarefully  targeted  pilot  interventions  to  support  rural  MSE  development;  and  (iii)  assess \ninstitutional  support  processes  and  the  feasibility  of  establishing  an  autonomous,  not-for-profit \nentity  to  facilitate  rural  MSE  development.  The  TA  loan  has  three  components:  (i)  market \ndevelopment  preparation  (MDP),  (ii)  sector  analysis  and  pilot  interventions,  and  (iii)  preparatory \nanalysis for the design of a Rural Enterprise Modernization Company (REMC).7 \n \n\n1. \n\nMarket Development Preparation \n\nThe TA team to be recruited for the MDP facility will analyze the outreach and resources \n15. \nrequired to build the business skills of small rural enterprises. MDP will involve preparatory work \nby  international  and  local  experts  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  market-driven \ndevelopment  program.  They  will  identify  areas  for  further  research,  initiate  the  collection  of \nrequired  data,  and,  finally,  design  pilot  projects  in  selected  subsectors.  It  is  expected  that  the \nwork under MDP will, within 18 months of the TA loan\u2019s inception, lead to a feasibility study on \nthe  establishment  of  the  REMC  and  other  alternatives  that  might  be  more  appropriate  to  the \nactivities  of  a  special  vehicle  for  strengthening  the  competitiveness  and  responsiveness  of \nnonfarm rural businesses to local and international markets. After this assessment of the need \nfor a vehicle such as REMC, and ADB\u2019s approval of such a need, the MDP team  will prepare \nthe  feasibility  study  for  the  design  of  the  organizational  and  operational  framework  of  REMC \n(outreach  strategy,  structure,  initial  business  plan,  standard  operating  procedures,  and  social \nand  environmental  compliance  processes).  SMEDA  will  house  the  MDP  team  within  the  rural \nenterprise modernization cell8 and, under guidance of a steering committee, assist in recruiting \na team of local and international consultants to do the work. SMEDA will also provide logistical \nand administrative support to the MDP team.9 \n \n16. \nThe MDP team will develop strong linkages with business associations, concerned donors \nand  donor-financed  projects,  commercial  banks,  microfinance  institutions  and  NGOs  supporting \nMSEs. In addition, the experience gained through the Agribusiness Support Fund and BSF will be \nthoroughly  analyzed.  These  linkages  with  ongoing  initiatives  will  allow  mutual  learning,  avoid \nduplication of effort, leverage limited resources, draw on the experience and strengths of partner \norganizations, and catalyze policy advocacy on behalf of rural enterprises. Linkages will also be \nestablished  with  rural  enterprise  development  and  BDS  programs  across  Asia.  The  Project  will \nhold workshops and training for a range of stakeholders. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Analysis and Pilot Interventions \n\n \n\na.  \n\nSector Analysis \n\n \n \n \n17. \nThe  MDP  team  will  review  secondary  sources  of  data  and  studies  on  rural  nonfarm \nenterprises, identify key gaps in knowledge, and commission or conduct additional research to \ndevelop a more complete and purposeful information (data) base on the rural nonfarm economy \nthat can inform the design of the rural enterprise development agenda.10 \n \n\n                                                 \n7   The  name  of  the  company  is  preliminary  and  may  be  changed  to  a  more  suitable  local  name  at  the  time  the \n\ncompany is established. \n\n8   Also known as Aik Hunar Aik Nagar.  \n9   SMEDA  has  done  considerable  research  on  SME  development  in  a  range  of  subsectors  and  has  gained \nconsiderable knowledge about small-scale industrial growth. However, SMEDA provides services mainly to urban \nSMEs, and also lacks a significant outreach capability. \n\n10  Supplementary Appendixes A and B give further details on the process to be followed in the sector analysis and in \n\nthe integration of information and communication technology in the various components of the Project. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nThe MDP team will prepare a database with information on the geographic and product \n18. \nmix  of  rural  and  peri-urban  small  enterprises  and  occupational  groups  in  Pakistan.  Such \ninformation is scarce at present.11 The database will systematically identify where and how (by \nscale, employment, and other enterprise characteristics) product subsectors tend to \u201ccluster.\u201d12 \nThis  information  will  enable  the  selection  of  subsectors  and  geographic  clusters,  and,  in  turn, \nthe  selection  of  specific  businesses  to  work  with  within  a  subsector.  The  result  will  be  a \ncomprehensive  analytical  database  on  the  rural  nonfarm  economy  that  would  be  a  \u201cone-stop \nshop\u201d  for  rural  development  workers.  Subsector  analyses  will  be  carried  out  in  approximately \ntwo to four subsectors. For ease of management, clusters within a subsector should be in close \ngeographic proximity and the subsectors should preferably be related.  \n \n19. \nThe  TA  team  will  determine  the  subsector  selection  criteria  in  conjunction  with  other \nstakeholders.  These  criteria  are  likely  to  include  (i)  size  of  the  sector  (number  of  MSEs13 and \npeople employed); (ii) growth potential (local and national demand and export prospects); and \n(iii) target group priority, i.e., women, minority group, unemployed youth, or geographic location. \nFor  the  pilot  projects,  at  least  two  subsectors  that  have  a  predominance  of  women  wage \nworkers  or  entrepreneurs,  and  that  demonstrate  the  growth  and  market  potential  of  the \nsubsector if assisted, will be chosen. The BDS needs of target businesses will be assessed to \nallow \nthat  are \norganizationally akin to and geographically within the reach of the target business groups. MDP \nresearch will focus on the supply, demand, and transaction issues related to promoting private \ncommercial BDS services. \n \n20. \nThe  MDP  team  will  prepare  subsector  and  cluster  development  plans  to  document \nopportunities and constraints in the selected subsectors. These plans will be prepared with the \nactive  participation  of  all  stakeholders,  including  MSEs  operating  in  the  subsectors/clusters, \nBDS providers, and other civil society organizations. The plans will clearly define development \ngoals, expectations, and the roles and contributions of the different stakeholders; the time frame \nfor completion; the exit strategy from the subsector once all the relevant links for better product \nmarketing,  design,  and  promotion  have  been  made;  risks  and  mitigation  strategies;  resource \nneeds; and monitoring and evaluation indicators.  \n\nto  develop  and  strengthen  private  sector  BDS  providers \n\nthe  Project \n\n \nb. \n\nPilot Projects \n\n \n21. \nFollowing  the  MDP-led  subsector  studies  identifying  the  opportunities  and  constraints, \npilot  projects,  including  two  pilot  projects  with  a  predominance  of  women  wage  workers  or \nentrepreneurs, will be undertaken to gain experience and develop a framework for the outreach \nand partnership arrangements with stakeholders, including the private sector. Through a series \nof  interactive  and  participatory  workshops,  a  priority  list  of  potential  pilot  projects  will  be \nidentified within the clusters/subsectors analyzed. The selection criteria for these pilot projects \n                                                 \n11 The last national survey of small and household manufacturing industries was conducted in 1996\u20131997. Relevant \nsources of research material are available from other small business support projects, such as SMEDA, the Punjab \nand Sindh Small Industries Cooperatives, and donor initiatives. \n\n12  It is widely observed that specific crafts and small-scale industries tend to be regionally concentrated in Pakistan \n(e.g., hand-stitched soccer balls and other sports goods in Punjab, handwoven textiles in Punjab and Sindh,  and \nhandicrafts in the North-West Frontier Province), but the opportunities for value addition in such clusters need to be \nsystematically analyzed.  \n\n13 The  definition  of  the  MSE  target  group  also  needs  to  be  determined.  SMEDA  sets  an  eligibility  ceiling  of  PRs20 \nmillion  in  assets  and  20  employees  for  trading  SMEs,  but  does  not  specify  lower  limits.  The  definition  of  MSE \nunder  the  TA  loan  will  probably  be  flexible,  varying  by  region,  given  the  differences  among  the  rural  areas  and \nenterprises. It is also to be noted that the term \u201csmall\u201d has never been explicitly defined by the Committee of Donor \nAgencies  for  Small  Enterprise  Development.  The  committee  considers  this  term  to  include  formal  and  informal \nnon-agricultural enterprises ranging from micro to medium size. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nwill  be  decided  by  stakeholders,  who  will  be  guided  in  their  choices  by  the  appraisal  unit \nestablished within the MDP to facilitate these processes. The main considerations in selecting \npilot projects will be the extent to which clearly identified market transactions can be assessed \nand  interest  solicited  for  products  and  services  from  potential  buyers  or  other  outsourcing \nopportunities, as an indication of market demand for the products of the pilot projects. Proposals \nfor pilot projects should include a built-in monitoring and evaluation process. Interventions within \nthe  pilot  projects  should  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  business  performance  of  selected \nsmall enterprises owned or managed by the target groups, leading to sustainable improvements \nin their livelihoods from nonfarm enterprises and activities.  \n \n22. \nThe  precise  nature  of  these  pilot  projects  will  be  determined  in  the  implementation \nphase. The TA team will need to start with an in-depth analysis of selected subsectors. Some \nillustrative examples highlight the potential and opportunities. Outsourcing is increasingly being \nrecognized  as  an  effective  business  development  strategy.  About  10,000  urban  workers  and \n30,000  rural  workers  in  the  1,450  villages  around  Sialkot  are  involved  in  the  production  of \nsoccer balls alone. Over time, these clusters producing hand-stitched soccer balls have evolved \npartnerships  with  leading  designers  and  distributors  of  sports  products  and  equipment.  With \ninternational focus on consumer labeling, opportunities have been created for improved working \nconditions  and  enhanced  wages  at  market  rates  for  workers  in  designated  work  centers,  and \nsupport  for  vocational  training  for  children  who  were  previously  associated  with  soccer  ball \nmanufacturing. Opportunities in rural and peri-urban areas in Pakistan continue to emerge, and \nover  time  there  has  been  an  increased  focus  on  competitiveness,  skills  development,  and \nresponsiveness to emerging market demand.  \n \nCeramics is another area where there is considerable potential and major production is \n23. \nconcentrated  in  clusters  operating  in  the  provinces  of  Pakistan.  Private  sector  partnerships \ncombined  with  business  development  facilitation  provides  a  potential  opportunity  to  facilitate \nmarket  linkages  for  producers  who  are  currently  unorganized,  know  little  about  sophisticated \nproduction  processes,  and  are  not  aware  of  the  contemporary  market  requirements.  Cluster-\nspecific interventions could support access to advanced technology and improved awareness of \nenvironment  and  labor  standards  in  selected  locations  for  a  range  of  hand-designed  products \nmade of ceramic tiles. Linked with this is the need to identify industries/areas with high potential \nfor attracting investments into the rural areas. This analysis should aim to identify concomitant \nneeds  for  local  infrastructure  development  that  the  public  sector  must  consider  to  realize  the \nidentified business promotion potential.14 \n \nThe  expanding fashion industry has established links with rural communities, especially \n24. \nwomen in contracting out various activities including raw material supply and fabric stitching. But \nunreliability  of  supply,  constraints  in  traditional  technology,  and  low  labor  returns  currently \nhamper the access of the rural poor to emerging market opportunities. While the private sector, \nincluding  some  of  the  large  buying  houses,  remains  keen  to  access  these  skills,  there  is  no \norganized  platform  available  to  link  these  producers  with  emerging  market  opportunities.  By \ntapping specialist skills in Pakistan or elsewhere in Asia, a pilot project might work in a selected \nproducer cluster to (i) organize the producers and facilitate the existing processes from design \nto  delivery;  (ii) assess  the  interest  of  local  producers  in  responding  to  market  demand  and \nimproving  product  quality  and  market  awareness,  and  the  interest  of  hand-loom  merchants  in \nimproving  marketing  know-how;  (iii)  support  training;  and  (iv)  facilitate  the  access  of \nproducers/merchants to suitable financing, market linkages, and BDS. The TA team will conduct \n\n                                                 \n14  Supplementary Appendix C further illustrates possible pilot projects and the associated monitoring framework. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nis \n\nto  avoid \n\nawareness-raising  campaigns  among  rural  businesses  to  encourage  socially  responsible \npractices and social protection measures. \n \n25. \nThe  TA  loan  will  be  an  MSE  facilitator,  but  must  avoid  distorting  the  market  and \nweakening  private  sector  initiative.  The  goals  are  to  rectify  knowledge  and  information  gaps, \nand  to  build  rural  MSE  capacity  to  develop  competitively.  Therefore,  in  designing  specific \ninterventions,  a  guiding  principle \ninculcating  beneficiary  dependency  and \nunsustainable business momentum through subsidized services. Instead, the efforts will support \nbusinesses by following a businesslike, transaction-based approach from the start of operations. \nThere must be a clear exit strategy from a given subsector, which should also be communicated \nto all participants. This approach is essential to ensuring sustainable impact. \n \nSome circumstances may justify subsidizing services directly, e.g., where there would be \n26. \na  substantial  demonstration  effect  on  businesses  that  are  too  risk-averse  to  invest  in  new \ntechnology or services, or reluctant to explore new markets. In these instances, the goals of the \nsubsidized services will be clear, explicitly agreed upon between recipient businesses and the \nMDP  team,  time-bound  (preferably  on  a  declining  basis),  and  will  provide  incentives  for  good \nperformers.  Any  case  for  subsidy  will  have  to  be  approved  by  the  appraisal  unit  after  going \nthrough a rigorous test to demonstrate its value and indispensability.15  \n \n\n3. \n\nRural Enterprise Modernization Company \n\n \n27. \nInternational  experience  indicates  that  opportunities  in  rural  competitiveness  can  be \nstimulated by access to a range of BDS services. These services facilitate acquisition of skills, \nknow-how,  expertise,  and  market  understanding  by  the  rural  MSEs.  The  Pakistani  market  is \ncharacterized by a generally low usage of BDS in the rural areas, which adversely affects the \nsector\u2019s  competitiveness  and  its  potential  contribution  to  the  economy  of  Pakistan.  To  fill  this \nvacuum in the rural areas, there is a strong rationale for supporting institutional processes that \ncan  strengthen  private  business  competitiveness  in  rural  areas  to  achieve  growth  in \nemployment  and  income,  particularly  among  enterprising  low-income  and  disadvantaged \nindividuals  and  groups.  Given  the  information  gaps  confronting  rural  markets  in  the  nonfarm \nsector,  preparatory  work  is  designed  to  better  understand  market  opportunities  for  the \nunderserved MSEs. Work carried out to identify potential subsectors, consolidate required data, \nand  draw  up  the  framework  for  the  pilot  projects  will  provide  the  basis  for  analyzing  the \ninstitutional processes required to stimulate competitive business development opportunities in \nthe rural areas and to establish the proposed REMC.  \n \nThe MDP team will also analyze alternative institutional support processes to document \n28. \noptions  available  to  the  Government  to  strengthen  private  business  competitiveness  in  rural \nareas  to  achieve  sustained  growth  of  employment  and  incomes.  It  is  expected  that  within  18 \nmonths  of  the  TA  loan\u2019s  inception,  ADB  in  consultation  with  the  Government  will  make  a \ndecision  on  the  establishment  of  the  REMC,  in  case  its  feasibility  is  established  and  the \nbusiness plan for REMC is approved. \n \n29. \nOnce  the  decision  is  made  to  establish  the  REMC,  the  MDP  team  will  define  a  cost-\neffective  management  structure  and  a  strategy  to  ensure  outreach  in  dispersed  rural  areas. \nFinancial projections to be prepared in support of the feasibility study  on the proposed REMC \nwill  analyze  the  fiscal  implications  of  its  establishment.  Strategies  will  be  prepared  to \n                                                 \n15  SMESDP  and  ADP  offer  subsidies  in  the  form  of  matching  grants  (under  the  Business  Support  Fund  and  the \nAgribusiness  Support  Fund,  respectively)  to  target  enterprises  and  groups.  Although  not  considered  at  this \nformative stage of REMC, such an approach may be revisited once REMC is well established and more is known \nabout the effectiveness of these funds under SMESDP/ADP. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ndemonstrate  how  sustainability  and  service  cost-effectiveness  issues  will  be  addressed  over \ntime. The expected management structure of REMC will be developed during the TA loan and \nwill  benefit  from  the  institutional  support  processes  and  structures  established  under  MDP \n(Appendix  5).  Assisted  by  SMEDA,  the  MDP  team  will  fulfill  all  requirements  for  registering \nREMC and obtaining a license to operate under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance 1984, \nincluding the preparation of the memorandum and articles of association, a business plan, and \nstandard  operating  procedures.  The  REMC  board  of  directors  will  be  drawn  largely  from  the \nprivate sector. The MDP consultants will prepare a list of potential candidates for the board in \nconsultation  with  a  variety  of  public  and  private  stakeholder  organizations.16 Government  will \nconsult with ADB before the notification of the board and its composition. \n \n30. \nTo  build  a  business-oriented  vision  of  rural  modernization  initiated  under  the  TA  loan, \nand  subject  to  the  established  feasibility  of  setting  up  REMC,  the  MDP  team  will  assist  the \nGovernment  in  operationalizing  REMC,  which  will  initially  take  on  the  MDP  activities.  Beyond \nthe  life  of  the  TA  loan,  REMC  will  be  responsible  for  expanding  its  geographic  outreach  by \nundertaking rural industry development projects in additional subsectors and clusters identified \nas  having  good  prospects  for  growth.  Research  into  new  opportunities  for  rural  enterprise \ndevelopment will be a core REMC activity. REMC\u2019s approach to developing rural industries will \nevolve  through  the  lessons  learned  from  the  pilot  projects  supported  under  the  TA  loan.  To \nsucceed, REMC must be both a doer and a learning organization that experiments with creative \napproaches to rural development. Besides establishing REMC, a major objective of the TA loan \nwill be to develop the competence and experience that will guide the company beyond the TA \nloan  period.  It  is  envisioned  that  ADB  may  provide  additional  funding  to  REMC  to  expand  its \noperations after the period. \n \n31. \nThe  MDP  team  and  REMC  will  encourage  socially  responsible  business  practices  and \nsocial  protection  measures  among  rural  businesses  through  awareness-raising  campaigns  by \nNGOs  and  incentive  schemes  to  address  issues  such  as  child  labor,  gender-sensitive  labor \npractices, environmental safeguards, the work environment, and fair remuneration and working \nhours. Other issues to be addressed include: patents, property rights franchising arrangements, \nand  rationalization  of  taxes.  Initiatives  will  also  be  taken  to  link  the  TA  loan\u2019s  target  groups  to \nongoing social service and community development programs under the rural support programs \nacross  the  four  provinces.17 Linking  up  with  rural  support  programs  and  other  NGOs  will  be \nparticularly useful in mobilizing women and gaining credibility in conservative communities. \n \n32. \nConsistent  with  the  approach  adopted  for  the  SMESDP,  REMC,  provided  its  feasibility \nhas  been  established,  will  be  registered  and  established  in  Lahore  under  the  auspices  of  the \nMinistry of Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives (MoIPSI). The Government will provide \nfunds  to  REMC  on  a  grant  basis,  and  assets  of  the  rural  enterprise  modernization  cell  will  be \ntransferred  to  REMC  upon  its  establishment  through  the  articles  of  association.  REMC  will  be \nfully  autonomous  and  will  report  to  an  independent  board  of  directors,  comprising  at  least  six \nmembers  from  the  private  sector  and  three  from  the  public  sector.  REMC  will  be  led  by  an \ninternationally  experienced  chief  executive  officer  to  be  appointed  by  the  board  following  a \ntransparent,  nationally  publicized,  competitive  recruitment,  on  a  no-objection  basis  from  ADB. \nThe  chief  executive  officer  will  be  supported  by  a  core  management  team.  To  ensure  the \nsmooth transition of knowledge resources and partnerships generated, staff associated with the \nrural  enterprise  modernization  cell  would  qualify  for  recruitment  for  REMC,  subject  to \n\n                                                 \n16  These  include  the  Lahore  University  of  Management  Sciences,  institutions  engaged  in  microfinance  or  small \nbusiness lending, apex bodies such as the Pakistan Microfinance Network, and corporate firms with rural focus. \n17  There are at least eight rural support programs in Pakistan, principally emulating the AKRSP model at the national \n\nand district levels. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ndemonstrated  performance,  compatibility  with  the  organization  structure  of  REMC,  and \nendorsement  by  the  REMC  board  in  consultation  with  ADB.  All  other  professional  staff \nrecruitments  will  be  outsourced  to  a  human  resource  consultant  and  the  final  selection  will  be \nendorsed by the REMC board.  \n \n33. \nAfter REMC is established, the knowledge management systems developed by the MDP \nteam  will  be  transferred  to  the  company,  and  it  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  potential \nopportunities in the selected subsectors, and for implementing the pilot projects. Expansion of \nscope and outreach will be undertaken following the evaluation of the first year of its operations, \nso  that  lessons  learned  can  be  incorporated  in  the  ensuing  work  program  of  REMC.  This \nassessment  will  allow  REMC  to  put  in  place  mechanisms  for  selecting  additional  subsectors, \npreferably  in  remote  and  disadvantaged  locations,  and  designing  intervention  strategies  and \nplans  for  supporting  small  rural  businesses  and  social  and  environmental  compliance.  As \nneeded,  REMC  will  outsource  specific  tasks  to  a  roster  of  international  and  domestic \nconsultants,  including  designers,  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  specialists, \nlawyers,  and  others.  The  immediate  task  of  the  core  management  team  will  be  to  develop \nguidelines  and  procedures  for  ensuring  geographic  outreach  and  undertaking  rural  industry \nresearch and development projects based on subsectors identified by the MDP team. This will \nalso  allow  REMC  to  develop  the  competence  and  experience  that  can  guide  the  company \nbeyond the TA loan period. It is envisioned that ADB may consider additional funding to REMC \nto prepare ensuing investments supporting rural enterprise modernization. \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nComplementarity with Other Development Projects \n\n1.  \n \n34. \nThe  TA  loan  is  a  unique  initiative  to  strengthen  rural  nonfarm  enterprises  and  will \ncomplement the interventions of SMESDP and ADP. The TA loan will focus on investigating and \ndeveloping  the  latent  potential  of  business  groups  in  the  rural  nonfarm  economy.  This  focus \ndiffers from the urban-based approach of SMESDP and the agribusiness focus of the ADP. At \nthe  same  time,  coordination  and  networking  with  SMESDP  and  ADP  will  ensure  experience \nsharing and synergy. Coordination with rural support programs and NGOs will enable the REMC \nto  facilitate  access  to  enterprising  communities  and  linkages  with  social  interventions  in \neducation,  health,  and  small  infrastructure  projects.  Collaboration  with  these  partners  will \nenhance the leverage for policy advocacy on behalf of the rural poor. \n \n35. \nEmployment  Practices.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  contribute  to  the  promotion  of  socially \nresponsive  initiatives  through  pilot  interventions.  Capacity  building  and  awareness  measures, \namong  others,  will  be  included  to  ensure  that  relevant  International  Labour  Organization \nconventions  (182  and  138)  are  not  breached.  Experiences  within  Pakistan,  particularly  in \nSialkot,  provide  useful  insights.  International  companies  sourcing  sports  goods  from  Pakistan \nhave appointed NGOs and other groups to monitor labor practices in MSEs making soccer balls \nin  Pakistan.  There  is  an  increased  effort  on  a  global  level  to  strengthen  internal  monitoring \nefforts and ensure that suppliers comply with local laws and company guidelines relating to the \nnonuse  of  child  labor.  Some  of  these  companies  use  NGOs,  while  others  use  not-for-profit \norganizations that provide auditing and monitoring services to ensure that their company codes \nare implemented. \n \n \n \n36. \nThe Project will work actively with district governments and stakeholders to enhance BDS \ncapacity in the rural areas. A particular focus will be to support grassroots enterprise experience to \n\nForms of Outreach  \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\fdemonstrate  to  district  governments  that  off-farm  business  development  is  possible  in  their \ndistricts. In  the rural  areas there are quite a few enterprising individuals, both  men  and women, \nwho have gained experience or received some basic training in small business development and \nare  associated  with  local  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  or  businesses  in  rural \nlocations.  Microfinance  institutions  and  rural  support  programs  also  have  a  sizable  client  base. \nThese entrepreneurs and community activists could also be brought into the business networks to \nenhance market contacts. These available resources will have to be tapped, and then plans will \nhave to be made to strengthen and organize their capacity. Local entrepreneurs and community \nactivists who know very well the communities they live and work in have an essential role to play \nin facilitating off-farm business development services.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n37. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $6.5  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, duties  and taxes,  and interest and service charges during implementation  (Table \n1).  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $2.6  million,  or  40%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency  cost  is  estimated  at  $3.9  million  equivalent,  60%  of  the  total  cost.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 6. \n\n \nTable 1:  Cost Estimates \n($ million) a \n\n \n\nComponent \n\nForeign  \nExchange  \n\nLocal  \nCurrency  \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nA.

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  8  years  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year \nduring  amortization.  The  TA  loan  will  fund  the  entire  foreign  currency  cost  of  $2.6  million  and \n$2.4 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government has agreed to provide $1.5 \nmillion, or 23% of the project cost, to meet part of the local currency expenditures. The use of \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  and  local  cost  financing  is  justified  because  TA  loan \ncomponents  will  act  as  a  catalyst  to  develop  poor  rural  enterprises.  The  Borrower  will  be  the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plana \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n($ million) \n2.6 \n0.0 \n2.6 \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n($ million) \n\nTotal  \nCost \n($ million) \n\n2.4 \n1.5 \n3.9 \n\n5.0 \n1.5  \n6.5 \n\n \n \nPercent \n77 \n23 \n100 \n\n        a    The  allocation  of  loan  proceeds  in  the  Loan  Agreement  will  be  presented  in  the  SDR  (special  drawing \nrights) equivalent of the US dollar amounts only for total expenditure, in accordance with Cost Sharing and \nEligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. R193-05. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nCofinancing in conjunction with the  proposed TA loan is not envisioned at the moment \n39. \nbut  may  be  mobilized  from  both  official  (loan  and  grant)  and  commercial  sources  for  the \nprojects/program to be detailed under the proposed TA loan. For cofinancing from commercial \nsources, such cofinancing may benefit from ADB credit enhancement, including ADB guarantee \ninstruments, and will be presented separately for Board consideration as and when needs arise.  \n \n40. \nRequest for Retroactive Financing. To ensure a fast start-up, the Government has \nalready  identified  product  groups  and  established  high-level  committees.  Support  is  being \nsolicited  from  the  private  sector  in  identifying  product  development  opportunities  based  on \nmarket  requirements.  To  maintain  this  momentum,  the  Government  wants  to  proceed \nurgently with the establishment of a rural enterprise modernization cell in SMEDA, staffed by \nexperienced  professionals.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  retroactive \nfinancing  for  the  recruitment  of  a  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  with \nrelevant  private  sector  experience  to  staff  the  cell  and  establish  an  office  presence  in  the \nfour  provinces  until  the  TA  loan  takes  effect.  Subject  to  ADB  approval,  international  and \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  the  relevant  ADB  guidelines.  These \neligible  expenditures  are  not  likely  to  exceed  $80,000.  Retroactive  financing  has  been \napproved  in  principle  by  the  Management  Review  Meeting  and  is  reported  in  the  ADB \nBusiness Opportunities but is subject to approval by the Board. The Government has been \nadvised that the provision of retroactive financing, with effect from 16 September 2005, does \nnot commit ADB to financing any part of this technical assistance loan. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n \n41. \nThe Executing Agency (EA) for the TA loan will be MoIPSI which will be responsible for \noverall project facilitation, management, and monitoring.  MoIPSI shall nominate a joint secretary \nas project coordinator for the overall coordination and implementation of the Project. The project \ncoordinator  will  coordinate  with  SMEDA  on  the  activities  undertaken  by  MDP  and  once  the \ndecision is made to establish REMC, will ensure its timely incorporation and establishment as a \nnot-for-profit  company.  SMEDA  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  responsible  for  components  1 \nand  2  (Market  Development  Preparation,  and  Sector  Analysis  and  Pilot  Interventions).  SMEDA \nwill oversee the establishment of REMC, subject to ADB\u2019s approval of its establishment, until its \nboard  of  directors  is  appointed.  Thereafter,  REMC  will  operate  as  an  autonomous  not-for-profit \ncompany. \n \n42. \nSMEDA\u2019s  financial  management  systems  will  be  relied  upon  for  the  implementation  of \ncomponents 1 and 2. SMEDA will be responsible for (i) recruiting, under the supervision of the \n\n \n\n\fsteering  committee,  the  team  of  consultants  for  MDP  and  staff  for  the  rural  enterprise \nmodernization  cell;  and  (ii)  facilitating  the  establishment  of  the  rural  enterprise  modernization \ncell  and  its  subunits  in  the  Project  area.  In  addition,  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness, \nSMEDA, through the team of MDP consultants, will determine the subsector selection criteria in \nconjunction  with  other  stakeholders.  SMEDA  will  ensure  that  an  appraisal  unit  is  established \nwithin  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to  assess  the  potential  clusters  and  subsectors  for  the \npilot  projects.  The  appraisal  unit  will  be  headed  by  the  team  leader  responsible  for  MDP  and \nshall comprise two members of the MDP team, the subsector development team leader, and the \ncluster  development  manager.  SMEDA  will  facilitate  workshops  and  seminars  to  engage  rural \nbusinesses in the subsector analysis and in the review of the pilot project experiences. SMEDA \nwill  also  facilitate  arrangements  for  training  and  capacity  building  for  cooperating  institutions \n(e.g.,  field-based  organizations  providing  access  to  communities  and  linkages  to  microfinance \nopportunities) and rural entrepreneurs. Outreach will be tailored to the specific needs of a given \ngeographic  area  and  the  operational  circumstances  of  the  sectors  in  which  interventions  are \nmade. The central office for MDP will be in Lahore, and small regional offices will be established \nin  selected  regions/peri-urban  areas.  A  subsector  development  team  leader  will  lead  the  pilot \ndevelopment  projects,  and  for  outreach  he/she  will  have  a  team  of  five  cluster/subsector \ndevelopment managers, based in the regions to ensure geographical coverage throughout the \nproject  area.  These  managers  will  supervise  and  guide  all  the  sector  development  projects  in \ntheir  regions.  Actual  outreach  within  a  cluster  will  be  undertaken  by  a  cluster  development \nofficer  from  the  same  geographic  area,  who  will  be  based  in  close  geographic  proximity  to \nhis/her  cluster,  and  recruited  through  a  competitive  process.  To  enhance  outreach,  functional \nlinks  will  be  established  with  district  governments,  rural  support  programs,  and  NGOs.  Formal \nand  on-the-job  training,  workshops,  and  trainer/mentor  relationships  between  central  and \nprovincial staff, and provincial and cluster-based staff, will be key links in the outreach. \n \n43. \nOversight  of  the  TA  loan\u2019s  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  a  steering  committee \nchaired  by  the  minister  of  MoIPSI  with  representation  from  the  economic  affairs  division, \nministry  of  commerce,  MoIPSI,  SMEDA,  Khushali  Bank,  six  private  sector  representatives  (at \nleast  two  of  whom  will  be  women),  and  the  project  coordinator.  The  steering  committee  shall \ncoopt other members on a need basis. The steering committee will meet as often as required \nbut at least once every 6 months. It will provide strategic and policy guidance to the MDP team \nand  REMC,  approve  the  annual  work  plans  and  budgets,  monitor  and  evaluate  performance, \nand facilitate intersectoral and interdepartmental coordination. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n44. \nThe TA loan will be utilized over 3 years. This will allow time to set up a functional rural \nenterprise modernization cell at SMEDA, and subsequently REMC (if found feasible), undertake \nthe  comprehensive  subsector  analyses,  and  initiate  work  on  core  pilot  project  interventions, \nwhich  are  critical  for  designing  follow-on  interventions  to  promote  market-led  growth.  The \nestablishment of an appropriate institution to steer the process of rural enterprise modernization \nwill  require extensive  stakeholder  consultations  within  the Government  and  with  private  sector \norganizations. More importantly, sufficient time is required for a careful assessment of relevant \ninitiatives  in  the  region  and  their  applicability  to  Pakistan.  A  comprehensive  capacity-building \nprogram  and  the  task  of  designing  the  pilot  projects  will  allow  the  staff  at  the  rural  enterprise \nmodernization  cell  to  gain  hands-on  experience  in  implementing  a  facilitative  program,  so  that \nthe  lessons  can  feed  into  institutional  development  approaches  required  for  a  scaled-up \nprogram  that  ADB  may  later  support.  The  MDP  office  and  basic  support  staff  required  for  the \nrural enterprise modernization cell will be assigned within 1 month of loan effectiveness, and the \nfirst four pilot projects (including two focused on women) will be developed within 12 months of \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nloan  effectiveness.  If  its  establishment  is  approved,  the  REMC  will  be  incorporated  within  24 \nmonths of loan effectiveness (Appendix 7). \n \n \n\nProcurement \n\n3. \n \n\n45. \nGoods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured through international competitive bidding if they cost more than $500,000 equivalent, or \nby international shopping if they cost from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent. If there are several \nlocal  suppliers  with  satisfactory  service  facilities,  equipment  or  materials  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding.  The  equipment  or \nmaterials may be directly purchased if they cost less than $50,000 (Appendix 8).    \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services and Technical Assistance \n\nin  selected \n\nlocations.  Of \n\nthe  consultant  services \n\n46. \nConsulting services are required for technical inputs and core project management. The \nTA  loan  will  provide  108  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  218  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services (Appendix 9). All consultants will be recruited according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for \nselection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Except  for  the  international  team \nleader/senior markets development specialist, who will be recruited as an individual consultant, \nthe core international and local consultants will be recruited through a firm, with the use of the \nquality  and  cost\u2013based  system.  In  addition  to  the  core  consulting  services,  NGOs  will  be \nengaged  individually  as  needed  to  provide  inputs  in  the  market  surveys,  organize  small \nentrepreneurs,  and  organize  training  workshops  and  focus  group  discussions  on  potential \nopportunities \nindicated  above, \napproximately 72 person-months of international services and 170 person-months of domestic \nservices will be available in a flexible resource pool to be tapped when needs arise (e.g., market \nresearchers, subject matter and sector specialists, designers, ICT experts, process engineers, \nand poverty, gender, and environment specialists).  \n \n \n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Islamic \n47. \nRepublic  of  Pakistan  and  Ministry  of  Industries,  Production,  and  Special  Initiatives.  Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the \nright  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\ntotal \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n48. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  To  expedite  disbursements,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established \nand maintained by SMEDA at the National Bank of Pakistan for the implementation of the MDP \ncomponent.  After  REMC  is  established  and  enters  into  a  project  agreement  with  ADB,  REMC \nwill  set  up  an  imprest  account  for  its  operation.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \n\n \n\n\fand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  in  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating \nthe  imprest  account  for  any  individual  payment  transaction  of  up  to  $100,000  equivalent.  The \ninitial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  approved  contracts  and  planned \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of the Project. However, total advances at any time are not to \nexceed  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  total  loan  amount, \nwhichever is less.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nIn each year of implementation, the EA will provide ADB with concise quarterly reports \ndetailing  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of  activities  against  agreed  targets  and \nsummarizing  the  results  of  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.  SMEDA  and  REMC  (upon  its \nestablishment) will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  the  expenditures  incurred,  and  the  use  of  local  funds. \nAccounts will be established and maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples and following the guidelines and procedures of the Ministry of Finance. Consolidated \nproject  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  compiled  and  audited  annually  by \nindependent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts,  audit  report,  and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the \nfiscal year to which they relate and should include an audit with a separate opinion on the use of \nthe  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedure.  SMEDA  has  financial  controls  in  place  and  the \naccounts  are  subject  to  government  procedures  and  regular  audit  by  independent  auditors \nappointed by the SMEDA board. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n50.  MoIPSI will ensure that SMEDA takes steps to set up a project performance management \nsystem (PPMS) as agreed with ADB, within 6 months of the effective date, cause it to be operated \nthroughout the project period, and transfer it to REMC upon its establishment. Under the PPMS, \nMoIPSI shall also periodically review the Project to assess and evaluate its scope, implementation \narrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and  achievements.  Within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion,  MoIPSI  shall  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  a  detailed \nevaluation of the progress implementation, costs, consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic \nimpact, and other details requested by ADB. \n\n \n\n51.  Within  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  gender \nstrategy described in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy plan (Appendix 10) has \nbeen  refined  and  that  a  gender-disaggregated  PPMS  has  been  established  as  agreed  with \nADB.  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  detailed  plan  for  gender-disaggregated \nperformance  monitoring  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  concurrence  shall  be  finalized  and  the  baseline \nsurvey for selected subsectors shall be completed.    \n \n52. \nThe PPMS will be in line with the performance measurement framework to be developed \nin  detail  for  all  three  components.  In  component  1,  the  performance  measurement  framework \nwill include a detailed set of criteria for the selection of subsectors, the design of the studies and \ndata collection, and the evaluation of the quality of the studies and data and their usefulness to \nthe pilot projects and REMC. Component 2 will involve three activities: (i) detailed design of the \nselection  of  pilot  projects  and  their  rationale;  (ii)  monthly  or  quarterly  monitoring  of \nimplementation,  using  monitoring  indicators  to  link  inputs  to  output;  and  (iii)  for  each  pilot \nproject,  evaluation  of  the  outcome  (output-to-outcome  relationships)  against  expectations, \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nincluding successes and failures and the reasons for them (market size, product quality, types \nof  services  and  products,  competitiveness,  penetration  or  reach  in  domestic  and  foreign \nmarkets, socioeconomic profile of producers and consumers, etc). Component 3 will require (i) \nregular monitoring (financial and administrative) using performance indicators, (ii) evaluation of \noutreach  activities  based  on  the  lessons  from  the  pilot  projects,  and  (iii)  assessment  of  the \nimpact  of  the  pilot  projects  and  outreach  programs.  Impact  assessment  would  focus  on  the \noutcomes of the pilot projects and REMC outreach. \n \n\n9. \n\n Project Review \n\n \n53. \nDuring the period of the TA loan, ADB will carry out an annual review to (i) determine if \nall implementation arrangements are in place and are appropriate and effective, (ii) assess the \noutcome  of  the  capacity-building  activities  and  training  programs,  (iii)  assess  the  progress  of \nbusiness and market development at the village and local levels, and (iv) recommend changes \nin implementation arrangements, as required. \n \nIt is recognized that the Project will demand close monitoring and supervision so that the \n54. \nnecessary  corrective  actions  can  be  determined  at  an  early  stage.  Quarterly  progress  review \nmissions  are  therefore  necessary  in  the  first  year  of  implementation.  Thereafter,  missions  will \nreview  the  Project  every  6  months.  Adequate  support  from  the  Pakistan  Resident  Mission \n(PRM),  regularly  provided,  will  be  critical  to  ensure  effective  supervision  by  ADB.18 A  midterm \nreview mission is planned 18 months after the effective date to discuss with the Government the \nfeasibility  of  establishing  REMC  and  alternate  strategies  and  options  for  supporting  the \ndevelopment of BDS in the rural areas. \n \nPeriodic  stakeholder  workshops  will  be  held  to  discuss  and  document  experiences. \n55. \nEighteen months after the inception of the TA loan, an independent assessment of the project \nwill  be  undertaken 19  by  consultants  with  experience  in  rural  enterprise  development.  The \nobjective will be to draw lessons and operational insights from the pilot projects, to identify best \npractices and initiatives, and to use the insights and knowledge gained to inform the subsequent \nagenda  and  programs  of  REMC.  The  findings  of  stakeholder  workshops  and  the  independent \nassessment  will  be  crucial  for  the  development  of  follow-on  initiatives  to  scale  up  the \ninterventions across a wider geographic and sectoral range. \n \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Impact and Benefits \n\n \nA.  \n \n56. \nIn essence, the TA loan is a pilot exercise that will assess constraints and opportunities \nin  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  and  develop  an  institutional  framework  to  facilitate  enterprise \ndevelopment and a more modern approach to rural business through better design, technology, \nand marketing. The direct long-term benefits will flow from increased nonfarm employment and \nincome-earning opportunities in the rural areas, particularly for wage earners, women, and poor \nproducer  groups  with  the  potential  to  engage  in  a  higher  level  of  commercial  activity.  These \ndevelopments  will  be  a  consequence  of  addressing  the  market  gaps  and  failures  in  selected \nsubsectors,  and  strengthening  the  competitive  position  of  the  MSEs  operating  within  those \nsubsectors. These measures are expected to increase the value added in the products sold and \nimprove commercial linkages between rural MSEs and the larger urban businesses. Each rural \nindustry  has  a  large  number  of  MSEs,  many  of  which  are  in  households.  As  the  Project \n                                                 \n18  Given  the  proposed  focus  on  innovative  initiatives  in  the  rural  development  sector,  posting  a  sector  specialist  in \n\nPRM to support ADB interventions must be a priority.   \n\n19  To be selected by MoIPSI and approved by the steering committee. \n\n \n\n\fEnvironmental and Social Impacts \n\ndevelops  beyond  the  TA  loan  period,  it  is  expected  that  the  know-how  developed  by  the  pilot \ninitiatives will be transferred to a wider group of rural enterprises. Indirect benefits will arise from \nthe  strengthening  of  rural  knowledge  and  human  capital,  and  a  reduction  in  the  incentives  for \nrural\u2013urban migration. \n \n57. \nIt is expected that the TA loan\u2019s outputs will result in measurable financial and economic \nbenefits for the targeted enterprises and industries. Overall, the TA loan is a catalyst and the full \neconomic impact will arise through multiplier effects on the target industries, communities and \ngroups.  Because  of  the  importance  of  the  multiplier  for  the  achievement  of  project  goals,  the \nlinkages  between  the  direct  activities  of  the  TA  loan  and  the  wider  rural  economy  must  be \nconsidered in plans for REMC to continue beyond the TA loan. The TA loan is considered as a \nfirst  step  in  a  longer  program  that  will  refine  the  approaches  to  rural  enterprise  modernization \nand extend these approaches to a wider rural base (Supplementary Appendix D). \n  \nB. \n \nThe  TA  loan  is  classified  as  category  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \n58. \nAssessment  Guidelines.  The  focus  is  on  sector  analysis  and  the  creation  of  an  institutional \nframework  for  facilitating  rural  nonfarm  development,  and  therefore  the  TA  loan  will  not  entail \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  have  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  or  the  environment \n(Appendix  10).  In  addition,  no  adverse  environmental  impact  is  expected  from  the  pilot \ninitiatives. As a check on environmental concerns, and for enhanced environmental awareness \namong  rural  enterprises,  consultants  will  prepare  guidelines  and  provide  training  in  social  and \nenvironmental screening during the preparation of subsector plans and interventions, including \nthe  pilot  projects.  Periodic  monitoring  by  poverty,  gender,  and  environmental  consultants  will \nensure that the TA loan\u2019s interventions are socially and environmentally sound. \n \n59. \nThe  TA  loan  will  have  positive  social  impact  through  increased  rural  employment  and \nhousehold  incomes.  A  systemic  attempt  will  be  made  to  reach  rural  women.  Women  will \nparticipate actively in the surveys and analyses, and women-managed enterprises will receive \nspecialized technical and managerial support. \n \nC. \n \n60. \nThe project design makes a number of assumptions with associated risks. It is assumed \nthat  the  Government  remains  strongly  committed  to  ensuring  enhanced  market  opportunities \nand  competitiveness  of  rural  enterprises,  especially  for  those  groups  that  now  lack  access  to \nmarkets.  The  present  Government  has  demonstrated  strong  ownership  and  commitment \nthrough a focus on addressing constraints on market access in the rural areas. It is recognized \nthat  the  project  design  will  require  a  knowledge-intensive  approach,  with  a  high  degree  of \nresponsiveness  to  emerging  market  opportunities.  In  addition,  there  is  a  need  to  work  with  a \nnumber  of  institutions  both  within  and  outside  government.  Extensive  consultations  with  all \nstakeholders, including the private sector, and high-level government support if not realized can \ncause  delays  and  may  limit  the  understanding  and  development  of  appropriate  institutional \nprocesses  required  to  support  the  competitiveness  of  rural  enterprises.  These  risks  are \naddressed through the creation of a high-level steering committee with adequate representation \nfrom the government and private sector. In addition, the Project provides flexibility in engaging \nthe private sector and other stakeholders in all undertakings, and on-time availability of a range \nof consultants with demonstrated technical knowledge and international experience to analyze \nsubsectors and design initiatives responsive to market opportunities in the rural areas. The need \nto  stimulate  improvements  in  the  design  and  quality  of  products  and  to  ensure  compliance  by \nthrough  a \nthe  rural  enterprises  with \n\nlaws  and  other  regulations \n\nis  addressed \n\nRisks \n\nlabor \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ncomprehensive  subsector  analysis  followed  by  carefully  designed  pilot  interventions  with \nappropriate  social  safeguards  and  processes  and  private  sector  linkages.  The  results  of  the \nsubsector  analysis  and  pilot  projects  will,  in  turn,  form  the  basis  for  the  business  plan  for  an \ninstitution  to  support  the  development  of  business  opportunities  for  rural  entrepreneurs, \nespecially those who exhibit substantial business potential but have no access to the required \nresources,  knowledge,  and  support.  The  proposed  sequencing  of  implementation  will  help  in \npreparing  relevant  area-  and  product-specific  strategies  for  promoting  business  development \nand in minimizing the risks associated with setting up an institution that may otherwise fail to be \nsocially  responsive,  sustainable,  and  relevant  to  the  needs  of  the  underserved  and  new  small \nrural entrepreneurs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n61. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available \nfor the implementation of the TA loan. \nThe Government will provide adequate office space for the TA loan. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  facilities  provided  under  the  TA  loan  are \noperated and maintained appropriately and adequate budget will be provided for \nthis purpose. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  the  interventions/investments  meet,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB, \nimplementation \narrangements and that all interventions are, to the satisfaction of ADB, properly \ncontrolled and monitored. \nThe Government will ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, including \nthe prohibition of child labor, and equal pay for men and women for work of equal \nvalue for activities under this TA loan.

Furthermore,  the  Government  will \nensure  that  affected  indigenous  peoples  will  have  opportunities  to  participate  in \nand benefit equitably from the Project.

substantial  contribution  to  gross  domestic  product \n1. \n(GDP). About 85% of exports from Pakistan are from agri-based industry (textiles and apparel \nmake  up  65%  of  agri-based  industry  exports). 2  Transport,  communications,  and  social, \ncommunity  and  personal  services  also  contribute  significantly.  According  to  the  Labor  Force \nSurvey  (2003\u20132004),  about  two  thirds  of  the  nonfarm  employed  labor  force  is  engaged  in \ninformal sector activities. Employment in rural areas in the informal sector is 10% higher than in \nthe towns. Informal activities are highest in Punjab and lowest in Balochistan. \n \n2. \nof unpaid family helpers is very low in the sector compared with the agriculture sector (Figure). \n \n\nThe informal sector is composed of self-employed and wage employees. The proportion \n\nFigure A2: \nPercentage Distribution of Employed Persons in Informal Sector \nin Rural Pakistan, 2001\u20132002 \n\nEmployer\n1%\n\nEmployee \n44% \n\nSelf employed\n45%\n\nUnpaid family \nhelper\n10%\n\nSource: Labor Force Survey (2001-2002). \n\n \n\n                    \n3. \nWomen  compose  only  9%  of  the  work  force  in  the  informal  sector.  Men  predominate  in \nwholesale trade and related work as managers, while women, with their lower levels of skill and \ncapital, as well as the cultural restrictions female workers face, are engaged in manufacturing as \ncraft and related workers. The informal sector is also characterized by long working hours and low \nwage  rates,  especially  for  women.  If  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  can  influence \nthe  proportion  of  women  employed,  then  even  a  relatively  small  increase  in  the  proportion  of \nwomen employed makes a large difference in their total employment (e.g., a 1% increase in the \nproportion of women employed represents an 11% increase in female employment). \n                                                 \n1   The informal sector as defined by the structure of the organization and the size of the establishment includes family \nenterprise/industrial  establishments  with  fewer  than  10  workers  and  nonindustrial  establishments  with  not  more \nthan 20 workers. \n\n2  The value added of the informal sector in  Pakistan cannot be directly estimated at the moment, since no special \n\nenterprise (or mixed) survey has been carried out so far. \n\n \n\n\f28          Appendix 2 \n\nMost  of  the  nonfarm  establishments  in  rural  Pakistan  are  informal  except  those  in  the \n4. \nenergy,  finance  and  insurance,  social  services,  and  mining  sectors  (Table  A2.1).  Food  and \ntextile industries provide significant opportunities in the rural areas. \n \n\nTable A2.1 \nPercentage Distribution of Formal and Informal Establishments by Type of Industry \nin Rural Pakistan, 2001\u20132002 \n \n\nInformal (%) \n\nIndustrial Establishment \nMining \nFood manufacturing \nTextile manufacturing \nWood and paper manufacturing \nChemical, metal/nonmetal \nOther manufacturing \nElectricity and gas \nConstruction \nWholesale and retail trade \nTransport and communications \nFinance and insurance \nSocial services \nHousehold/Personal services \n \n \n\nTotal (%) \nTotal (units) \n\nFormal (%) \n89.7 \n25.4 \n29.8 \n11.2 \n56.2 \n33.8 \n98.3 \n15.7 \n2.1 \n21.7 \n46.4 \n83.1 \n5.6 \n30.2 \n2,383 \n\n10.3 \n74.6 \n70.2 \n88.8 \n43.8 \n66.2 \n1.7 \n84.3 \n97.9 \n78.3 \n53.6 \n16.9 \n94.4 \n69.8 \n5,510 \n\nTotal No. \n29 \n185 \n738 \n143 \n338 \n68 \n120 \n1,220 \n1,814 \n980 \n56 \n1,486 \n716 \n \n7,893 \n\nSource: Labor Force Survey (2001\u20132002). \n\nHousehold and Small Enterprises \n\n \nB. \n \nAccording  to  the  Small  and  Household  Manufacturing  Industries  survey  of  1996\u201319973 \n5. \nthere were 427,784 manufacturing units in the country. Of these, 70% were in Punjab, 15% in \nSindh, 12% in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), and 3% in Balochistan. The average \nemployment size was less than three persons per unit (2\u20132.6 persons). Of the total number of \nmanufacturing  units,  99%  were  small  and  household  units.  Nearly  38%  of  the  small  and \nhousehold manufacturing units operated from the owner\u2019s dwelling. \n \n\nTable A2.2 \nPercentage Distribution of Household Units and Small Enterprises in Rural Pakistan \n \n\nProvince \nPunjab \nSindh \nNWFP \nBalochistan \nPakistan \n\nHousehold Units \n\nSmall Establishments \n\n1983\u20131984 \n61.7 \n42.7 \n39.5 \n14.3 \n56.7 \n\n1996\u20131997 \n51.6 \n59.0 \n23.5 \n92.7 \n49.6 \n\n1983\u20131984 \n38.3 \n57.3 \n60.5 \n85.7 \n43.3 \n\n1996\u20131997 \n48.4 \n41.0 \n76.5 \n7.3 \n50.4 \n\nNWFP = North West Frontier Province. \nSource: Small and Household Manufacturing Industries Survey (1983\u20131984 and 1996\u20131997). \n\n                                                 \n3   The  Factory  Act  1934  of  Pakistan  requires  all  establishments  employing  more  than  10  persons  to  register.  The \nSmall  and  Household  Manufacturing  Industries  Survey  covers  all  unregistered  household  units  and  small \nestablishments irrespective of the size of employment and type of activity. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2          29 \n\nIt  is  assumed  that  a  transition  from  a  household  business  to  a  small  business  with \n6. \nemployees  is  an  indicator  of  commercial  development.  The  data  in  Table  A2.2  show  an \naggregate decline in household units and an increase in small establishments from 1983\u20131984 \nto  1996\u20131997  in  rural  Pakistan.4 A  later  survey  (Household,  Income,  and  Expenditure  Survey \n2001\u20132002) shows that more than 50% of the industrial units are in Punjab (mainly in the south \nand central districts), 27% are in NWFP (largely textiles and carpets), 13% in Sindh (wood and \nfood  products),  and  8%  in  Balochistan.  In  rural  Balochistan  only  2%  of  households  had \nmanufacturing  units.  Overall,  this  suggests  a  trend  toward  viable  small  businesses  that  the \nproposed Project can build on. However, provincial data show that this transition is happening \nonly  in  Punjab  and  NWFP  (where  the  greatest  percentage  increase  in  small  business  has \noccurred). The data show an increase in household units and a decline in small establishments \nin  Sindh  and  Balochistan.  The  reasons  for  this  change  are  unknown,5 but  will  be  examined \nunder the TA loan\u2019s Market Development Preparation studies. \n \n\nTable A2.3 \nDistribution of Labor, Capital, Output, and Value Added Across Selected Small Industries \nin Rural Pakistan, 1996\u20131997 \n \n\nValue \nAdded \n(%) \n\nInput-\nOutput \nRatioa \n0.46\n0.14\n0.23\n0.48\n0.40\n0.68\n0.34\n0.47\n0.52\n0.52\n\nFixed \nAssets \n(%) \n41.1\n0.7\n0.9\n3.6\n10.4\n2.0\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n6.0\n\nPersons \nEngaged \n(%) \n11.9\n6.8\n8.2\n3.2\n2.8\n1.6\n2.5\n10.5\n0.9\n7.8\n\n15.6\n3.0\n4.8\n4.7\n4.7\n3.5\n1.2\n2.0\n1.3\n16.0\n\nIndustrial \nCost (%) \n14.4 \n0.5 \n1.5 \n4.7 \n3.4 \n8.0 \n0.7 \n1.8 \n1.5 \n18.4 \n\nProduction \n(%) \n15.0\n1.8\n3.2\n4.7\n4.0\n5.6\n1.0\n1.9\n1.4\n17.2\n\nUnits (%) \n20.4 \n10.1 \n8.4 \n4.3 \n3.1 \n2.8 \n2.7 \n1.9 \n1.4 \n1.3 \n\nIndustry \nWheat milling \nMade-up textile \nWoolen carpets \nWooden furniture \nSawmills \nJewelry \nOther handicrafts \nTobacco stemming \nAgri machinery \nBricks and tiles \nCotton weaving \n(finish) \nOther leather \nproducts \nSilk spinning and \nweaving \n \nAll other industries \n \n \n \n \n \na   Input-output ratio indicates that jewelry is the most input-intensive industry.

Wheat \nmilling and tobacco stemming (i.e., primary processing of leaves) employ the most people, while \nthere has been a shift away from employment in woolen carpet manufacture. Brick and tile units \nemploy more people on a unit basis than any other industry. \n \n8. \nBrick and tile units also add the most value, followed by wheat milling (mainly in Punjab). \nIn  contrast,  textiles  and  carpet  making  (mainly  in  NWFP)  are  low-value-added  industries  but \nemploy 15% of the rural workers engaged in small and household manufacturing units. These \nindustries appear to be the most labor-intensive and low-capital industries. \n \nC. \n \n\nIssues and Constraints: Case Studies of Rural Subsectors \n\n1. \n\nThe Handloom Industry in Punjab \n\n9. \nThe hand-loom industry is an old and traditional industry in Pakistan (and India). Various \nproducts are produced, such as bedsheets, carpets, cushion covers, duster-khwans, khes, long \ncloth, lungies, napkins, pillow covers, table covers, and towels. This variety suggests that there \nis considerable demand and possible scope for expansion. The industry is labor-intensive and \nmainly  employs  poor  wage  laborers.  For  these  reasons,  the  industry  appears  well  suited  for \nsupport under the Project. \n \n10. \nAbout 30,000 hand-loom units exist in rural areas. This activity is very small-scale, low-\ninvestment, and mostly located at the household level. Almost all the units are located in Punjab \nwith about one third located in the district of Multan. Table A2.4 shows the basic statistics on the \nhand-loom industry in rural Punjab. It is this kind of basic data that will be gathered during the \ndiagnostic phase of the work and used as the basis for the pilot projects. \n  \n\nTable A2.4 \nHand-Loom Industry in Rural Punjab (1996\u20131997) \n \n\nSmall \nEstablishments \n\nHousehold \nUnits \n2,384 \n3,273 \n4,781 \n51,913 \n\n \n\n517 \n1,069 \n13,028 \n42,301 \n\nTotal Units \n2,901 \n4,342 \n17,809 \n94,214 \n\nItem \nNumber of units \nPersons working \nValue of fixed assets (PRs\u2019000) \nValue of production (PRs\u2019000) \nIndustrial and nonindustrial cost (PRs\u2019000) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nValue added (PRs\u2019000) \nNote:  In  the  hand-loom  industry,  nonindustrial  cost  includes  only  travel  and  storage  expenses.

In \n12. \n1947,  there  were  250,000  units.  By  1998,  there  were  only  50,000,  and  by  2005,  only  30,000 \nunits. A large number of landless and nonfarm households are involved in this industry. Despite \ngreat  potential  for  absorbing  labor,  this  sector  is  in  decline.  Power  looms  are  the  main  threat \nbecause  they  are  cost-efficient  compared  with  hand  looms.  Low  levels  of  education,  lack  of \nawareness  of  market  demand,  and  lack  of  know-how  of  quality  products  are  also  significant \nissues for the hand-loom industry, which faces these other constraints: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThere  are  few  raw  material  markets.  These  are  found  only  in  Karachi, \nFaisalabad, and Multan. \nBecause of the physical limitations of the hand loom, a cloth more than 10 yards \nlong cannot have a uniform design, and quality standardization is minimal. \nHand-loom  weaving  is  no  longer  a  family  craft  because  of  lack  of  government \ninterest.  Low  returns  discourage  the  younger  generation  from  working  in  this \ntrade.  \nDespite  great  export  potential,  because  of  low  production  at  one  time,  industry \nexports are negligible. \n\n2. \n\nHandicrafts in the North-West Frontier Province \n\nThis  industry  has  a  high  potential  for  employment,  low  investment,  and  high  value-\n13. \nadded.  In  Pakistan,  the  handicraft  industry  manufactures  a  variety  of  products  ranging  from \nfabric  and  embroidery  to  jewelry,  carving,  and  mirror  work.  About  80  different  kinds  of \nhandicrafts are produced in Pakistan. The most prominent handicrafts are: leather goods, brass \ngoods and brass work, copper ware and tableware, onyx and marble products, woodcraft, textile \nand  block-printing  fabrics,  embroideries,  glass  beads,  traditional  and  contemporary  jewelry, \ncamel-  and  snake-skin  products,  pottery,  hand-knitted  carpets  and  rugs,  shell  and  bone \nproducts,  and  costume  dolls.  However,  like  the  hand-loom  industry,  this  industry  is  losing  its \ncraftsmanship.  In  2001\u20132002,  Pakistan  exported  $20  million  worth  of  handicrafts.  Handicraft \nexports  increased  to  $27  million  in  2002\u20132003.  But  from  July  to  October  2004,  these  exports \namounted to only $1.6 million, against $4 million during the same period the previous year. \n \nHandicrafts  are  a  largely  rural  activity,  with  64%  located  in  NWFP.  Specialized \n14. \nhandicrafts of the province include leather, wood, metal, wax painting, and printing. Table A2.5 \ngives the basic statistics on the handicraft industry in rural NWFP.  \n \n\nTable A2.5 \nHandicraft Industry in Rural NWFP, 1996\u20131997 \n \n\nItem \nNumber of units \nPersons working \nValue of fixed assets (PRs \u2019000) \nValue of production (PRs \u2019000) \nIndustrial and nonindustrial cost (PRs \u2019000) \n \n\nRaw material cost \n\nHousehold \nUnits \n4,332 \n9,275 \n19,781 \n137,752 \n \n30,384 \n\nSmall \nEstablishments \n\n1,821 \n5,953 \n188,162 \n42,326 \n \n21,356 \n\nTotal Units \n6,153 \n15,228 \n207,943 \n180,078 \n \n51,740 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32          Appendix 2 \n\nSmall \nEstablishments \n\nFuel/Electricity cost \nOther industrial costs \nIndirect taxes \nNonindustrial cost \nTotal cost \nValue added (PRs\u2019000) \n\nItem \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote: As in the hand-loom industry, nonindustrial cost in the handicraft industry  includes only travel and storage \nexpenses.

Small interventions to favorably alter the climate and operations of business can have \na  disproportionately  large  effect  on  wages,  incomes,  and  the  employment  of  the  worst-off \ngroups (e.g., women and the underemployed). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3          33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT \n \n\n \n \nProject Title \nAgribusiness Development Project \nSmall and Medium Trade Enhancement Project \nTrade Export Promotion and Industry \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program \nSmall  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  Development  Program \n(Project Loan) \nMicrofinance Sector Development Project \nMicrofinance Sector Development Program \nPakistan Poverty Alleviation Project \u2013 Phase 1  \nSecond Poverty Alleviation Fund Project  \n \nBanking Sector Technical Assistance Project  \nState Bank Partnership for Microfinance \nFinancial Sector Strengthening Program \nEU Capacity Building for Trade-Related Activities  \nTrade Initiatives from a Human Development Perspective \nProposal to Support Craft-Based Enterprises \n\n \n \nFunding Agency \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \n\nExternal \nAssistance \n($ million) \n31.0 \n150.0 \n7.5 \n152.0 \n18.0 \n\nADB \nADB \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nSDC \nSDC \n \nUNDP \nUNIDO \n\n80.0 \n70.0 \n90.0 \n238.0 \n20.0 \n26.5 \n0.7 \n2.4 \n7.3 \n2.0 \nTo be \napproved \n10.0 \n\nCompetitive Support Fund \n \nBilateral Assistancea  \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EU  =  European  Union,  IBRD  =  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment, IDA = International Development Association, SDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, \nUNDP  =  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  UNIDO  =  United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization, \nUSAID = United States Agency for International Development. \na   Enterprise  development  initiatives  of  the  Aga  Khan  Rural  Support  Program,  National  Rural  Support  Programme, \nPunjab Rural Support Programme, and other nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have been financed by several \nbilateral  agencies  including  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency, and others.

Public \nprovision of infrastructure\u2014roads, power, and telecommunications\u2014will obviously facilitate rural \nnonfarm dynamism. Rural nonfarm production has mostly comprised non-tradables produced by \nhouseholds and microenterprises (e.g., food processing, housing, retail trade, and services). In \na few East Asian countries\u2014People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Republic of Korea, Japan, and \nTaipei,China\u2014rural  industrialization  has  extended  to  larger-scale,  often  export-oriented, \nproduction  of  goods  such  as  textiles  and  metal  products.  The  central  feature  of  Asia\u2019s  rural \nnonfarm growth is that it has been led almost entirely by the market and the private sector. State \nefforts to promote rural industrialization directly have generally not succeeded on a broad scale \n(the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s township and village enterprises are the primary exception), \ndespite  the  appeal  of  arguments  for  enhancing  efficient  employment  creation,  alleviating  rural \npoverty,  reducing  rural-to-urban  migration,  and  containing  the  external  costs  of  excessive \nurbanization.  \n \nA. \n \nAfter  several  years  of  efforts  to  build  a  consensus  on  principles  for  selecting  and \n2. \nsupporting intermediaries in micro- and small enterprises in finance, around the mid-1990s, the \nCommittee  of  Donor  Agencies  for  Small  Enterprise  Development 1  turned  its  attention  to \nbusiness  development  services  (BDS)\u2014the  wide  array  of  nonfinancial  services  that  enable \nbusinesses  to  grow  and  develop.  Motivating  the  search  for  a  new  paradigm  for  BDS  was  the \nrecognition that traditional interventions have failed to provide good-quality, affordable BDS to a \nlarge proportion of small enterprises. There was consensus that publicly funded services have \nnot achieved their objectives, since programs had had low impact, had limited outreach and cost \nefficiencies,  and  were  not  sustainable  since  service  provision  ended  when  program  activities \nended. \n \n3. \nTherefore, at its annual meeting in 1995, the donor committee decided to focus on BDS \nfor  small  enterprises,  with  the  objective  of  identifying  and  documenting  best  practices  in  this \narea.  Building  on  this  work,  between  1998  and  2000  a  series  of  international  and  regional \nconferences  were  organized  under  the  auspices  of  the  donor  committee.  The  BDS  working \ngroup prepared a draft document with guiding principles based on the papers and discussions \nfrom  these  conferences.  The  draft  served  as  the  basis  for  discussion  and  for  the  emerging \nconsensus  on  principles  for  donor  interventions  in  BDS.  The  \u201cBDS  market  development \nparadigm\u201d grew out of a shred conviction within the donor community that achieving economic \nand social goals was possible only by relying on private sector actors to provide a diverse array \nof  services.  Relying  on  the  private  sector  to  achieve  greater  outreach  demanded  better \nunderstanding of how BDS providers could be financially self-sustaining or even profitable.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Members  include  Asian  Development  Bank,    Canadian  International    Development    Agency,  Department    for    \nInternational  Development,  European  Bank  of  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation,  United Nations Development  Programme, and United States Agency \nfor International Development. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          35 \n\nUp-Country Experience in Rural Business Promotion \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nAga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) \n\n \nOver its 20-year-plus history, AKRSP has tried almost all models that were in vogue at \n4. \nany  given  time  for  supporting  small  businesses.  Currently,  AKRSP  is  pursuing  the  market \ndevelopment  approach  and  developing  its  facilitative  role.  The  shift  from  one  paradigm  to \nanother has, however, been dictated not by theories but by hands-on experience of what works \nbest and what does not, and has been reinforced by international best practices. While lessons \nlearned by AKRSP in integrated rural development and microfinance have been well recognized \nand  drawn  upon,  insights  from  AKRSP\u2019s  extensive  enterprise  development  history  of  over  20 \nyears\u2014the  longest  in  the  country  for  any  organization  supporting  rural  small  businesses\u2014are \njust  beginning  to  be  tapped.  It  is  expected  that  this  experience  will  gain  significance  in  the \ncoming years as small business promotion in rural areas gains momentum and attracts policy-\nlevel attention in meeting the poverty reduction goals of the Government. \n \nWorking  Through  Community  Organizations.  Experience  gained  in  the  early  1980s \n5. \nindicated  that  though  the  community  organizations  were  effective  in  initiating  and  managing \npublic  projects,  the  success  of  a  business  project  rested  on  individual  profit  motivations, \nrequiring  the  skill  and  creativity  of  individual  entrepreneurs  rather  than  community  groups, \nparticularly  since  not  all  members  of  a  group  would  have  the  inclination  or  the  drive  for \nbusiness. Issues of mistrust, and questions regarding profit allocations commensurate with the \ntime and hard work put in by different group members, further confirmed the nonviability of the \ncommunity organization for commercial activities. The marketing of fresh fruits and vegetables \nthrough village organizations had its demonstration and awareness-raising effects; nonetheless, \nthe business momentum was picking up more outside the community organizations rather than \nwithin.  Additionally,  the  initial  collectivist  efforts  were  steered  not  by  what  would  sell  in  the \nmarket  but  what  could  be  grown  in  the  northern  regions,  i.e.,  they  were  supply-  rather  than \ndemand-driven.  The  experience  during  this  phase  shattered  the  belief that  the  only  issue  was \nmarketing,  highlighting  the  complexities  of  marketing,  the  significance  of  consumer  demand, \ncompetition,  and  the  synchronization  of  the  production  and  marketing  operations  to  compete \nfavorably. \n \n6. \nSupporting  Individual  Entrepreneurs.  Subsequently,  AKRSP  shifted  its  focus  to \nsupporting individual entrepreneurs through a variety of capacity-building measures and equity \ncontributions.  Businesses  in  new  areas  were  established  and  existing  ones  strengthened. \nNonetheless, the cost of working directly with individual entrepreneurs was very high, and only a \nlimited  number  of  entrepreneurs  could  be  reached.  Moreover,  such  direct  support  for  small \nbusinesspeople  diluted  their  own  stakes  in  the  business,  created  dependency  on  external \nassistance,  and  raised  issues  about  the  sustainability  of  the  momentum  created  within  a \nbusiness  once  support  was  withdrawn.  Most  of  all,  concern  about  displacing  private  sector \nproviders of services and creating market distortions also arose.  \n \n7. \nCreating and Working with Cooperatives. Driven by limited impact and cost-efficiency \nissues  and  in  its  efforts to  multiply  job  and  income-earning  opportunities,  AKRSP  also  tried  to \nestablish  cooperatives with  a  range  of  shareholders.  These  cooperatives  remained  dependent \non AKRSP for their day-to-day operational management because of low literacy levels and the \nlimited capacity of the managers to work independently. From this experience, AKRSP learned \nthree  lessons,  which  influenced  its  decision  to  establish  its  wholly  owned  businesses.  First, \nbusinesses needed to be established with well-researched profitability prospects. Second, they \nneeded  to  be  established  as  business  entities  distinct  from  AKRSP  with  their  own  financial \n\n \n\n\f36          Appendix 4 \n\nmanagement  and  accounting  systems.  And  third,  the  job  of  managing  a  large  business  was \ncomplex  and  too  specialized  to  be  managed  by  largely  illiterate  poor  farmers,  whose \ncommercial  exposure  was  limited.  Subsequently,  criteria  for  establishing  wholly  owned \nbusinesses  were  established,  not  to  open  the  doors  to  private  sector  investment  but  rather  to \nmake AKRSP more cautious in its choice of investments. \n \n8. \nExperience of Wholly Owned Businesses. AKRSP\u2019s direct interventions in the market \nwere  rationalized  by  the  absence  of  business  capacity  and  resources  within  the  northern \nregions to take on such ventures and the livelihood opportunities that these projects promised. \nFollowing  a  tight  process  of  screening,  more  business  ideas  were  rejected  than  accepted  at \nAKRSP. Starting in the late 1990s, with cost-free donor funds and limited business experience, \nAKRSP  established  its  wholly  owned  businesses  in  four  subsectors  in  which  the  northern \nregions  were  considered  to  have  a  competitive  advantage  (dry-fruit  processing,  woolen  fabric \npatti/shu  marketing,  vegetable  seed  production  and  marketing,  and  coal  mining).  AKRSP  had \nthe advantage of access to cost-free donor funds. The long-term objective was to make these \nprojects profitable and privatize them. \n \n\n2. \n\nSwiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) \n\n \n9. \nIn 1997 SDC assisted the Karakorum Area Development Organization based in Hunza \n(Northern  Areas  of  Pakistan)  in  establishing  the  Threadnet  Project  (TP)  to  enhance  poor \nwomen\u2019s  income-earning  opportunities.  Design,  raw  material  purchase,  product  development, \nand marketing are centralized functions performed by TP. Women are contracted to work either \nat home or at the work centers of TP to produce a variety of hand-embroidered products such \nas pouches, key chains, handbags, and belts. The embroidery skills of more than 300 women \nhave been polished and they are earning about PRs1,500 to PRs2,500 per month (on a piece-\nrate basis). The projects sell mainly among visiting tourists in the northern regions of Pakistan, \nthough efforts have also been made to tap selective stores down-country. The project lacks in-\nhouse business and design expertise and is heavily dependent on donor funding. The prospects \nof the project becoming a financially sustainable business are suspect. SDC is currently in the \nprocess of deciding how best to disengage itself from the project as part of its exit strategy from \nthe  Northern  Areas.  Had  attention  to  an  exit  route  been  paid  right  from  the  start,  perhaps  the \ndesign of the project would have augured better for its sustainability.  \n \n10. \nOther  initiatives  of  the  SDC  in  the  Northern  Areas  include an  apricot  oil  extraction  and \nmarketing business and green-wood furniture making. Both projects have been set up to spur \ninterest among the risk-averse local people by demonstrating to them the business potential of \nthese two sectors. Nonetheless, it is still too early to comment on the impact of these projects, \nas they were initiated very recently. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nTraditionally, targeted and singularly focused efforts to safeguard the economic interests \nof  the  rural  and  peri-urban  poor  have  been  pursued  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nand  social  development  programs  since  they  work  directly  with  the  poor  to  alleviate  poverty. \nEven  though  poverty  is  a  complex  phenomenon  with  many  causes  and  no  single  route  to  its \namelioration,  most  agencies  accept  the  more  non-controversial  and  generally  held  belief  that \npoverty is about absence of economic opportunities and the capacity to avail oneself of those \nthat  do  exist.  Hence,  it  is  understandable  when  development  organizations  working  with  the \npoor design interventions that focus on economic aspects of poverty or  when public initiatives \nfocus on the same. \n\nEnterprise Development Experience in Other Rural Areas \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          37 \n\nConcerted programs for integrating the poor in mainstream commercial activities can be \n12. \nbroadly  categorized  into  financial  (in  Pakistan  the  focus  is  mainly  on  micro-credit)  and \nnonfinancial  BDS,  though  nonfinancial  services  also  frequently  come  packaged  with  micro-\ncredit. It is important to highlight the fact that while micro-credit operations and products can be \nstandardized  for  given  target  groups  and  geographic  locations,  nonfinancial  services  are \ndifferent,  and  standardizing  them  would  be  contrary  to  their  objective  of  being  demand-driven \nand  responsive  to  market  realities.  This  makes  the  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of \nnonfinancial service programs more challenging and demanding.  \n \n13.  While  holistic  social  rural  development  through  community  group  mobilization  and  the \nbuilding  of  self-help  capacity  has  a  rich  and  encouraging  history  in  Pakistan,  the  record  of \nnonfinancial  service  programs  to  enhance  income-earning  and  job  opportunities  for  the \nmarginalized  poor  is  mixed,  debatable,  and  not  as  clear  in  its  accomplishments.  Various \nprogrammatic designs have been tried, but plaguing nonfinancial service programs is a supply-\nled, direct-service-delivery, subsidies-oriented approach that is constrained in its outreach, not \nsustainable  over  the  long  run,  cost-inefficient,  and  therefore  also  limited  in  impact  and  not \nreplicable. \n \n14. \nmarginalized communities in down-country Pakistan are discussed below. \n \n\nRepresentative  popular  NGO  models  for  delivering  nonfinancial  BDS  to  the  poor  and \n\n1. \n\nSupporting \nCircumventing the Problems Caused by the \u201cEvil Middle Man\u201d  \n\nthe  Production  and  Marketing  of  Handicrafts  and \n\nin \n\nliving \n\n \nFor  access  to  commercial  markets  for  their  products,  particularly  embroideries  and \n15. \nhandicrafts  produced  by  women,  communities \nremote  areas  depend  on \nmiddlemen/women.  The  farther  the  distance  from  commercial  markets,  the  higher  the  service \ncharge or commission of the agent. In addition, the more dispersed the producers, the less the \nlikelihood  of  their  collectively  associating  to  gain  more  negotiating  leverage.  Women\u2019s  limited \nmobility  in  the  rural  areas  is  a  major  constraint  on  their  active  engagement  in  the  commercial \narena. \n \nIn  their  efforts  to  circumvent  the  high  commission  charges  to  poor  communities,  some \n16. \nNGOs  have  set  up  working  units  or  their  own  agents  within  the  rural  areas,  which  serve  as \npoints where work is contracted out to women and where delivery of final products is taken. To \nfind  good  markets  for  women\u2019s  handicrafts  and  embroideries,  the  NGOs  also  provide  women \nwith design and product manufacturing assistance and access to raw materials. In this respect, \nthe NGO serves as a business contracting out work to piece-rate workers and selling it in the \nmarket. Though these initiatives address the design and marketing needs of the rural and peri-\nurban women, the NGOs do not function as  profitable, and hence sustainable, ventures as their \nbusiness  operations  are  heavily  subsidized  and  dependent  on  donor  grants,  with  limited \nprospects  of  attaining  financial  sustainability  in  the  future.  Thus,  their  activities  can  be \ncategorized  as  noble  welfare  activities  but  not  as  a  business  model  that  can  be  replicated. \nIllustrative  examples  are  the  Threadnet  Project  of  the  Karakorum  Area  Development \nOrganization,  and  Hawwa  Associates  and  Sungi  Foundation\u2019s  women\u2019s  hand-embroidery  and \nhandicrafts outlets in Islamabad.  \n \n\n2. \n\nVocational Training for Employment \n\n \n17. \nThe  rural  support  programs  (most  notably  the  National  Rural  Support  Programme), \nthrough  their  affiliate  capacity-building  organizations,  provide  a  range  of  vocational  training \n\n \n\n\f38          Appendix 4 \n\nprograms in the farm and nonfarm areas (in welding, cooking, tailoring, driving, auto-mechanic, \nstitching,  knitting,  and  other  skills)  to  improve  the  job  prospects  of  the  poor.  Community \norganizations within a given area identify the prospective trainees, and final selection is made \nby  the  rural  support  program  through  a  rigorous  process  to  determine  the  seriousness  of  the \npotential  trainee  and  his/her  economic  status.  Training  is  conducted  through  the  vocational \ntraining  institutes  of  the  Government,  whose  service  delivery  capacity  has  been  strengthened \nand training programs redesigned to meet market job requirements. Since the aim is to target \nthe  poorest  of  the  poor  or  the  jobless,  training  is  highly  subsidized  and  only  a  token  fee  is \ncharged. For women, training is conducted within the community. Thousands of people in 79 out \nof Pakistan\u2019s 120 districts have been trained over the last few years. Through random sampling, \ntraining  utilization  is  checked.  Overall,  it  appears  that  this  program  is  enabling  people  to  get \nsemiskilled and skilled jobs.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Business Subcontracting Model: Providing Embedded Services on \na Sustainable Basis \n\n \nPerhaps the most viable mechanisms through which home-based and small businesses \n18. \nare acquiring BDS in a sustainable fashion are in the shape of embedded services (i.e., services \nthat  come  packaged  with  commercial  transactions  between  businesses).  For  example,  many \nprivate women-owned businesses have sprung up around areas where there is a prevalence of \nhand-embroidery skill\u2014almost across Pakistan\u2019s rural and selected peri-urban areas. Typically, \ndesign, purchase of raw materials, cutting and stitching, and the final sale of the garments are \ncentralized functions performed at the factory/premises of the entrepreneur. Poor women skilled \nin embroidery are contracted by the entrepreneurs on a piece-rate basis and provided designs, \nraw materials, and some coaching in new embroidery techniques and skills. The women either \ntake the work home and complete it as and when their home responsibilities permit, or work for \nfixed  hours  at  the  premises  of  the  entrepreneur.  By  linking  up  with  business-savvy  private \nentrepreneurs,  rural  women  are  able  to  have  an  assured  income  and  markets  and  can \novercome limitations in market access, information about consumer preferences, and design. \n \n19. \nBusinesses  targeting  high-end  consumers  are  more  quality-conscious  and  therefore \nwilling to invest more in building the capacities of the small businesses that they subcontract to, \nso that the latter remain loyal to them and do not start supplying to competition, as is bound to \nhappen inevitably. A small business that has gained important technology, design, and market \naccess  by  working  with  larger  businesses  is  Millat  Tractors  Limited.  Millat  claims  to  have \ndeveloped the entire vehicle parts industry in Pakistan by working with home-based workshop \nowners  and  upgrading  their  capacities,  in  addition  to  working  with  large  parts  suppliers. \nLikewise,  the  income  levels  of  the  tobacco-leaf-growing  farmers  in  the  North-West  Frontier \nProvince  have  improved  substantially  through  their  work  with  Pakistan  Tobacco  Limited  and \nLakson Tobacco Limited.  \n\n \nSelected International Experience \n\nD. \n \n20. \nSeveral  successful  models  of  this  approach  in  the  region  have  had  a  major  impact  on \nthe  rural  economy.  These  include  the  \u201cOne  Tambon\u2013One  Product\u201d  Program  (OTOP)  and  the \nThai  Business  Initiative  in  Rural  Development  (TBIRD)  Program  (undertaken  by  an  NGO)  in \nThailand. The Government of Pakistan views the OTOP model as having the potential to be a \ncatalyst  for  rural  modernization  in  Pakistan.  Thailand  also  has  its  National  Support  Services \nProgram, which has been implemented for 4 years by the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural \nCooperatives  (BAAC)  with  the  European  Union  as  the  international  partner.  In  the  Philippines \nthe  Growth  with  Equity  in  Mindanao  Program  has  similarities  in  approach  with  the  concept  of \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          39 \n\n\u201ceconomically  just  development,\u201d  which  has  attracted  the  interest  of  the  Government  of \nPakistan.  \n \n21. \nOTOP  has  focused  on  various  rural  products  including  textiles,  ceramics,  handcrafted \npaper,  fruits  and  vegetables,  and  leather  goods.  Design  and  technology  assistance  (for  raw \nmaterials,  product  identification,  packaging,  transport,  and  finance)  is  supported  by  a \nsophisticated  market  information  system.  Partly  through  participation  in  product/trade  fairs, \nOTOP tries to connect craft manufacturers with a global market that rewards a high level of craft \nskill  and  encourages  self-reliance  and  the  human  development  of  village  folk.  However,  there \nare  aspects  of  the  OTOP  program  that  are  very  specific  to  its  origins  and  to  Thailand.  OTOP \nwas based on a program started in Oita Province in Japan. The purpose of this project was to \nimprove on locally available products and produce goods acceptable to the international market. \nThis  program  inspired  the  Thai  Government  to  adopt  a  similar  approach.  \u201cOne  Tambon \n(Village)\u201d was included in the title to emphasize the twin ideas of equality (the program is spread \nacross  the  village  economy)  and  comparative  advantage.  The  Japan  External  Trade \nOrganization  (JETRO)  launched  a  1-year  program  to  support  the  Thai  Government  from \nJanuary to December 2002. \n \n22. \nFrom  an  institutional  point  of  view,  OTOP  involves  many  related  ministries  and \ndepartments  of  the  Thai  Government.  It  is  important  to  understand  that  the  system  of  local \ngovernment in Thailand is strong. Local government coverage is wide and a number of powers \nare  decentralized  especially  to  the  province.  Thailand  has  what  is  termed  a  \u201cCEO\u201d  style  of \nprovincial  government,  whereby  provincial  governors  are  encouraged  to  look  upon  their \nprovince as a business and to maximize its \u201cprofits.\u201d This approach to local government fits well \nwith  OTOP.  Given  this  structure,  there  has  been  no  need  to  develop  a  distinct  OTOP \ncorporation. \n \n23. \nOTOP  can  draw  on  technical  departments  and  on  financial  institutions  for  technical \nassistance.  In  the  Thai  context,  local  skill  levels  are  often  quite  high  (one  reason  why  the \nprogram was able to select a \u201cOne Product\u201d approach is that the ethnic/cultural base of the Thai \nnormally allows for a high degree of specialization by a given community). OTOP has received \nconsiderable support from the financial sector. The support comes from such institutions as the \nVillage Fund, the People\u2019s Bank Program, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nBank. The provision of micro-credit has been an exceptionally important aspect of OTOP. \n \n24. \nKey to understanding the implementation of OTOP is the link between the program and \nJapan.  JETRO  saw  that  rural  craft  manufacturers  in  Thailand  had  already  achieved  a  high \ndegree of skill and considerable product diversity. This had been encouraged for years, e.g., by \nthe Royal Project of His Majesty the King. There was already a base of skills and products that \nwould appeal to the Japanese consumer. \n \n25. \nOTOP has therefore focused on the Japanese market (and to a degree on the tourists \nvisiting Thailand). JETRO provided the services of Japanese design experts and other technical \nassistance \nfor  Japan.  OTOP  emphasizes \nenvironmentally  friendly,  handmade,  and  high-quality  products,  which  are  not  necessarily \ncheap. In no sense is OTOP \u201cpoverty relief\u201d; it seeks to encourage people to aspire to a much \nhigher standard of living. \n \nThe country context of OTOP is quite different from that of Pakistan. OTOP built on the \n26. \ntradition of village specialization in products and the existing high level of skill. This situation is \nnot  present  in  Pakistan.  Secondly,  in  contrast  to  Pakistan,  the  local  government  system  in \n\nto  upgrade  selected  products  specifically \n\n \n\n\f40          Appendix 4 \n\nThailand Business Initiative in Rural Development  \n\nNational Support Services Program (NSSP), Thailand \n\nis  well  developed  with  provincial  heads  managing \n\ntheir  constituencies  with \nThailand \nconsiderable entrepreneurial autonomy. Thirdly, and most important, OTOP started off with an \nedge  in  that  there  was  a  keen  market  for  its  products.  Japanese  investors  were  interested  in \nwhat was being produced in Thailand and willing to invest in it. Lastly, OTOP is a government \ninitiative operated without cost to the enterprise. Other international experiences like the TBIRD \nproject in Thailand have more relevance for Pakistan. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nOn the premise that NGOs and villagers do not have the required business acumen, the \nTBIRD project aims to link the informal rural sectors and formal businesses. The Population and \nDevelopment  Association,  which  started  the  project,  leveraged  its  success  in  family  planning \nand  rural  development  to  engage  multinationals  to  \u201cadopt\u201d  villages  and  develop  sustainable \nbusiness  projects.  Companies  sponsor  TBIRD  projects  by  contributing  5%  of  their  director\u2019s \nfees and 5% of the director\u2019s bonus to a fund for rural development. Some companies provide \nmore.  Other  companies  provide  technical  assistance,  for  instance  by  providing  their  workers \npaid leave to go to the project village and help directly in establishing a manufacturing line. The \nprogram  has  had  considerable  success  working  with  the  Bata  shoe  company.  About  4  million \npairs of shoes are now made in northeastern Thai villages (the poorest part of the country). Nike \nand Dr Scholl are also involved in the program.  \n \nF. \n \n28. \nNSSP  began  in  2001,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  financial  crisis  of  1997,  and  ended  in \nFebruary  2005.  Its  objective  was  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  smaller  and  poorer  Thai \ncommunities to have a wider range of high-quality financial services. Another objective was to \noffer  villagers  support  in  dealing  with  people  returning  to  the  rural  areas  from  the  cities  as  a \nresult  of  the  financial  crisis.  The  project  involved  thousands  of  villagers  and  staff  from  BAAC, \nwhich  was  the  executing  agency.  There  were  two  main  components:  a  microfinance \ndevelopment  program,  and  a  community  enterprise  development  program  financed  through  a \nrevolving fund by the European Union for a total grant of \u20ac15 million.  \n \nThe project was able to reach 360 villages or community enterprise groups with 36,000 \n29. \nvillagers  qualifying  for  training.  Males  and  females  were  almost  equally  balanced  in  receiving \nsupport. Activities were concentrated in three provinces (Thailand has over 70 provinces), which \nwere considered pilot areas. NSSP developed a number of key tools designed to provide skills \nand  assist  in  creating  strong  and  disciplined  microfinance  intermediaries  and  community \nenterprise  groups.  These  tools  included  aspects  of  accounting,  management,  and  marketing \ndesigned to qualify the groups for credit from BAAC.  \n \nOutreach  has  been  a  major  factor  in  the  success  of  the  NSSP.  BAAC  has  nationwide \n30. \ncoverage down to the subdistrict level, with representatives in almost every community. These \npersons also received training under the project while providing critical local knowledge to the \nproject  staff  at  national  level.  An  important  lesson  learned  was  that  the  project  had  to  target \ngroups  that  had  already  started  in  business  (not  necessarily  the  poorest  of  the  poor)  and  that \nhad an established network of community and business relationships. Social as well as physical \ncollateral was found to be an indicator of debt performance. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          41 \n\nfor \n\nCharoen Pokphand \n\nthe  United  States  Agency \n\nThe  GEM  Program  (supported  by \n\nGrowth with Equity in Mindanao (GEM) Program, Philippines \n\nG. \n \n31. \nInternational \nDevelopment  since  1996)  aims  to  accelerate  economic  growth  in  Mindanao  and  help  assure \nthat as many people as possible, including members of cultural and religious minorities, benefit \nfrom economic growth. The program provides limited financial support, on a cost-sharing basis, \nto  producer  groups  and  other  organizations.  It  works  with  producers\u2019  associations  and \ncooperatives,  NGOs,  the  Mindanao  Business  Council,  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim \nMindanao  (ARMM)  Business  Council,  chambers  of  commerce,  local  governments,  the  ARMM \ngovernment,  national  government  line  agencies,  bilateral  and  multilateral  donor  agencies, \nprivate  firms,  and  other  organizations  and  individuals  working  to  bring  about  equitably \ndistributed  economic  growth.  GEM  also  has  political  objectives  (e.g.,  bringing  peace  to \nMindanao)  that  are  outside  the  scope  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  project.  Nonetheless, \nGEM provides an excellent example of a successful rural modernization program. \n \n32. \nThe principal activities of GEM to promote growth are: (i) business support organization \ntargeted  commodity  expansion,  and  (iii)  community  and  mid-scale \ndevelopment,  (ii) \ninfrastructure  programs.  The  targeted  commodity  expansion  program  aims  to  introduce  or \nsignificantly  expand  the  production  and  marketing  of  lucrative,  nontraditional  commodities  in \nconflict-affected  areas  of  Mindanao;  help  assure  that  all  elements  of  the  cold  chain  and  \u201ccool \nchain\u201d  are  in  place  for  expanded  vegetable  and  fruit  shipment  to  markets  throughout  the \nPhilippines  and  the  Asian  region;  and  help  expand  exports  of  fish,  fruit,  and  vegetables  to \nexternal markets (especially the People\u2019s Republic of China). \n \nH. \n \n33. \nTechnology  transfer  can  also  be  achieved  by  the  private  sector  through  contract \nproduction.  A  well-known  example  of  technology  and  business  links  between  large-scale \nagribusiness  and  small  farmers  was  pioneered  in  Thailand  by  Charoen  Pokphand  (CP),  a \ncompany that later became a large conglomerate, extending its reach to other Asian countries. \nCP brought in a poultry hybrid and set up a large automated feed mill, which remains the core of \nits operations. The arrangements between the farmers and CP range from a guaranteed price \ncontract to a guaranteed wage contract. The sheds in which the chickens are raised are owned \nand operated by the farmers, although their construction may be financed with loans from the \ncontracting company. With a guaranteed price contract, prices of inputs and output are fixed in \nadvance,  with  the  firm  bearing  all  the  price  risk,  while  farmers  bear  the  production  risk.  CP\u2019s \nextension  services  are  remarkable  in  intensity  and  quality.  The  company\u2019s  extension  staff \nmakes regular visits to provide technical information, check the animals\u2019 health, and ensure that \nthe  farmers  follow  the  company\u2019s  regulations.  Many  farmers  graduate  to  fully  independent \nstatus  as  contractors,  although  links  to  CP  are  usually  maintained  through  purchase  of  the \ncompany\u2019s feed. Poultry raising in Thailand has grown within two decades into a major export \nindustry. \n \n34. \nPrivate contract farming could be extended to nonfarm rural enterprises, but may have \nonly a limited role to play. Where contract farming has been most successful, there is usually a \nrelatively rigid package of technical inputs and a high ratio of purchased inputs in total costs. In \naddition, because of economies of scale, companies like CP tend to work with the larger farms \nand  to  push  small  farmers  into  undertaking  larger  operations.  The  main  lesson  that  it \ndemonstrates is that a very input-intensive agriculture such as poultry raising also requires very \nintensive  input  from  a  labor  force  that  is suitably  educated  (in  this  case,  the  extension  staff  of \n \nthe contracting company and, over time, the contract farmers with their newly acquired skills). \n\n \n\n\f42          Appendix 4 \n\nNarai Technologies, Thailand \n\nI.  \n \n35. \nAt the other end of the investment scale from CP, Narai Technologies Co. Ltd. (NT) was \nestablished  in  Thailand  in  1993  with  the  aim  of  identifying,  developing,  and  transferring \nagricultural technologies from more developed countries to less developed countries where the \nmarket opportunities were great. Its investments included manufacturing cotton machinery, teak \ntree development, and food systems engineering. Following a survey and an understanding of \nthe  value  chain  in  fish  faming  from  supply  of  seed  fish  (fingerlings)  to  demand  for  specific \nspecies  (in  this  case,  tilapia),  NT  selected  the  Asian  Institute  of  Technology  (AIT)  as  a \ntechnology partner. A commercial partnership was formed to establish a commercial tilapia fry \nhatchery registered in 1993 as Nam Sai Farms (NSF). NSF ownership was 70% Thai and 30% \nNT.2 Total  start-up  investment  was  approximately  $150,000,  spent  on  ponds  and  a  hatchery. \nNSF began to produce eggs regularly from its own brood stock in May 1995, but 1996 was the \nfirst year of full production, with a total sales output of 3.2 million fry/month (significantly higher \nthan ever achieved in Southeast Asia). Progress was often slow because of growing conditions \nand  issues  related  to  water  quality,  but  by  1999  Nam  Sai  Farm  produced  an  astounding  80 \nmillion  fry.  At  this  level  of  production  (6.7  million  fry/month),  NSF  earned  revenues  of \napproximately $17,500 per month. The company employed 80 full-time staff (two thirds female) \nand  was  the  largest  single  employer  in  the  local  village  (a  place  of  some  400  households \napproximately 200 km from Bangkok). In 2000, NT sold the business at a profit and transferred \nownership  to  the  Thai  shareholders.  The  business  remains  extremely  successful  and  is  a \nclassic model of high-tech transfer leading to significant rural employment. \n\n                                                 \n2  AIT as an academic institution could not participate directly in the business. However, Narai Tech agreed to pay a \n\nroyalty to AIT based on production of fry. The royalty agreement was canceled by mutual agreement in 1999. \n\n \n\n\fPROPOSED ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE \nOF THE RURAL ENTERPRISE MODERNIZATION CELL \n \n\nSteering Committee \n\nChief Executive Officer/Senior \nMarket Development \nSpecialist/Team Leader \n\nAppendix 5          43 \n\n \nMoIPSI \n\nChief Executive \nOfficer, SMEDA\n\nOutreach/ \nInstitutional \nDevelopment/\nTraining \n\nProduct \nDevelopment/Market\ning/Sector \nSpecilaists \n\nKnowledge Management \nSupport Team \n\nPool of subject \nmatter specialists \n(rural market \neconomist; capacity-\nbuilding specialist; \npoverty, gender, and \nresettlement \nspecialists, etc.) \n\nProvincial Institutions \n\nFinance, \nAdministration  \n\nKnowledge Mgmt \nSystem team: \nKMS Coord., IM \nSpecialist, IT \nSpecialist,  \nWeb Master, etc.\n\nDistrict-Level Institutions \n\nSub Sector \nDevelopment Team \n\nCluster Development Managers  \n\n \n\nCluster Development Officers \n\nFinance, Accounts, and \nAdministration Officers \n\nRural-based business \ndevelopment service \nnetworks \n\n \n \n\n \n\nIM = information management, IT = information technology, KMS = Knowledge Management System, MoIPSI = Ministry \nof Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives, SMEDA = Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable 6.1: Project Cost Summary, by Componenta \n\nItem\n\n1.

Poverty in Pakistan has a \nsignificant rural dimension. The number of poor people1 in Pakistan rose sharply in rural areas during the 1990s from \n22.1% of the population in 1990 to 35.2% in 1999. By the end of the 1990s the number had increased from 25.2% to \n33% in Punjab, from 24.1% to 26.6% in Sindh, and from 35.5% to 42.6% in the North-West Frontier Province (only in \nBalochistan  was there a substantial decline from 38.4% to 22.8%).2 Understanding intraregional poverty  is also very \nimportant  (e.g.,  in  Northern  Punjab  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  29.5%  whereas  in  Central  Punjab  it  is  34.8%  and  in \nSouthern Punjab it is 39.7%).  \n \nA very important characteristic of rural poverty in Pakistan is that upward of 40% of the labor force depends entirely on \nnonfarm  activities.  In  the  1990s  the  growth  of  nonfarm  activities  was  severely  affected  by  low  economic  growth,  a \ndecline in public sector spending, and lower worker remittances from the Middle East due to the scaling down of the \nconstruction boom. \n \nTraditional  rural  development  programs  are  most  unlikely  to  improve  the  livelihoods  of  this  group  of  nonagricultural \nlaborers  domiciled  in  the  rural  areas.  It  is  to  this  group  of  people,  which  includes  some  of  the  poorest  and  most \nvulnerable  groups,  that  the  Project  is  targeted.  The  emphasis  in  the  Project  is  one  of  rural  modernization,  not  rural \ndevelopment.  It  takes  a  different  approach:  the  identification  of  new  technologies  and  ideas  (e.g.,  for  design  and \nmarketing) and their transfer to rural communities to facilitate institutional processes required to support the transfer of \ncompetitive approaches to industrial and market activities. The focus is on fostering rural businesses and associations \nand  transferring  modern  commercial  practices,  together  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  human  and  management  (\u201csoft \nasset\u201d) development. It is based on a trajectory of development that has facilitated economic and social development \nin other developing member countries, especially the countries of East and Southeast Asia. \n\nB. \n\n \nPoverty Analysis                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\nEconomic determinants of poverty include decline in public sector investment and fiscal policy, limited participation of \nwomen in the remunerated labor force, inflation, and lack of access to markets and services in the rural areas. Social \ndeterminants include the highly unequal distribution of land; the hierarchical, almost semifeudal, structure of parts of \nrural society; the low levels of human development; and gender inequalities.  \n\nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  has  facilitated  a  wide  range  of  responses  to  poverty  including  governance  reforms, \nongoing public works programs, a microfinance program, and a variety of social protection programs. The Project has \na focus on micro- and small enterprises (MSEs), one of the four sectors identified in the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper for reducing poverty in Pakistan. Civil society  groups including nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the \nprivate sector are also involved in a range of activities to alleviate or reduce poverty. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The Planning Commission of the Government of Pakistan has decided that the official poverty line for Pakistan will \nbe  pegged  at  2,350  calories  per  day.  This  is  based  on  an  adult  equivalent  intake  of  2,150  calories  in  the  urban \nareas and 2,450 calories in the rural areas. The poverty line for Pakistan per month in 2005 is PRs832 per capita. \n2   Asian  Development  Bank.  2002.  Poverty  in  Pakistan  \u2013  Issues,  Causes,  and  Institutional  Responses.

Its  specialized  agency  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Authority  will  be  directly  responsible  for \ninitiating the Project and over time will devolve responsibility to a new agency, a not-for-profit company. This institution \nwill determine processes to support outreach mechanisms  and  develop partnerships  with rural support programs and \nNGOs with extensive networks in rural areas.   \n \nPoor and vulnerable groups, including, most importantly, women, will be afforded the opportunity to fully participate in \nthe  Project  as  several  of  the  pilot  projects  will  be  targeted  at  women.  Since  the  Project  is  premised  on  establishing \nsuccessful and profitable linkages  with the market sector, remote areas are not likely to receive immediate attention \nduring the initial implementation phase of the technical assistance (TA) loan. Once successful models of partnerships \nand  institutional  processes  are  developed,  interventions  will  be  planned  on  an  extensive  scale  in  a  variety  of  rural \nlocations.  The  participation  strategies  for  each  cluster  and  subsector  will  be  designed  during  implementation. \nHowever,  the  guiding  principle  will  be  to  develop  local  capacity.  These  will  include  fostering  business  development \nservice (BDS) networks in unions and subdistricts, identifying and strengthening enterprise support services through \nlocally  based  partner  organizations,  and  anchoring  the  process,  where  the  BDS  networks  will  be  set  in  place  and \nenterprise support service organizations become visible.  \n \nThe  Project  will  actively  support  grassroots  enterprise  experience.  At  the  rural  level  there  are  sizable  numbers  of \nenterprise  trainers,  both  men  and  women,  who  have  been  trained  and  are  running  local  NGOs  or  businesses  in \nvillages and other rural locations. It will therefore be essential to tap into these available resources, and then initiate \nplans to strengthen and organize them. Furthermore, in clusters to be identified under the Project, preference will be \ngiven to areas that have these resources, particularly women trainers and business managers. Specific initiatives will \nthen be designed to support proposals from enterprise service providers that can demonstrate outreach to women and \nmarginalized groups associated with MSEs. A range of other activities will be supported, including mobilization of craft \nproducers, facilitation of craft bazaars, product development and diversification, design and packaging, and linkages \nwith  credit  and  leasing  facilities.  Experiences  gained  in  different  regions  on  minimizing  child  labor  and  creating \nvocational  opportunities  for  such  children  associated  with  enterprise  labor  will  also  be  analyzed  to  ensure  that \nclusters/subsectors selected continue to demonstrate progress in enhanced social awareness and fair trade practices.   \n \n\n \n\nGender Development \n\nD. \nThe design of the Project takes into account the fact that this is not a rural development project per se but rather one \nthat  builds  the  enabling  environment  for  rural  modernization  to  take  place  in  Pakistan  that  focuses  on \ncommercialization  and  nonfarm-based  activities.  The  Project  will  design  a  range  of  business  development  services \nthat  take  into  account  the  different  sociocultural  contexts  of  women  in  rural  Pakistan  society  to  ensure  that  the \nbusiness  models  developed  are  applicable  to  women  from  all  rural  social  strata.  A  range  of  interventions  are \nproposed.  These  include  support  for  craft  bazaars,  practical  training  in  the  management  of  microenterprises,  a \nprogram  of  outreach  to  rural  women  through  locally  based  business  development  service  providers,  female \nmembership in the enterprise development teams, consultations with the representatives of women associations and \nchambers, and representation of  women in the steering committee and the board of Rural Enterprise  Modernization \nCompany  upon  its  establishment.      Additionally,  participation  in  training  and  study  tours,  the  leveraging  of  other \nprojects, gender-disaggregated monitoring  and evaluation, and gender and development consultancy support are all \npart of the Project.   \n \nIn  subsectors  and  clusters  to  be  identified  under  the  Project,  preference  will  be  given  to  areas  that  have  these \nresources,  particularly  women  trainers  and  business  managers,  to  expand  outreach  and  access  to  women \nentrepreneurs  and  to  women  seeking  to  become  entrepreneurs.  Emerging  evidence  suggests  that  an  increasing \nnumber of women, especially younger women, are interested in becoming entrepreneurs rather than simply waiting for \nand expecting nonexistent or poorly targeted government welfare measures. Specific initiatives will then be designed \nvia a range of participatory tools and techniques that take into account local women\u2019s livelihood demands to support \nenterprise service providers that can demonstrate outreach to women and marginalized groups associated with micro- \nand  small  enterprises.  A  range  of  capacity-building  interventions,  specifically  tailored  training,  and  linkages  with \nmarkets  and  financial  institutions  will  be  supported.  Experiences  that  have  been  gained  in    different  regions    in \nminimizing child labor and creating vocational opportunities for such children associated with enterprise labor will also \nbe  analyzed  to  ensure  that  clusters/subsectors  selected  continue  to  demonstrate  progress  in  enhanced  social \nawareness, fair trade practices, and sensitivity to gender concerns.  \n \nTo ensure adequate focus on social and gender issues, the Project Performance Monitoring System will be developed \nto include indicators and evaluate aspects such as good practices associated with the design of pilot projects ranging \nfrom  the  extent  of  community  (men  and  women)  participation  to  the  development  of  demand-driven  interventions. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          57 \n\nSocial  and  gender  indicators  that  are  important  include  assessments  as  to  the  changes  in  working  time  and  daily \nworkload\u2014ideally over the preceding 4\u20136 months to capture seasonality\u2014of women and the changes in the quality of \ntheir lives and capacity to cope with these changes. In certain cases, involvement in activities associated with the pilot \nprojects is likely to increase the working time and daily  workload of women and girls. However, women and girls are \nlikely to accept an increase in workload if they realize that the benefits exceed the costs of being actively involved in \nthe pilot development of MSEs. The important point in relation to  girls is  whether such  involvement  would see them \nopting out of attending school on a regular basis. If the pilot projects are to contribute to the mitigation of bonded child \nlabor, it will be necessary to monitor and evaluate to what extent this actually occurs. The Project should appoint an \nindependent  agency  such  as  an  NGO  or  similar  organization  well  versed  in  all  aspects  of  bonded  child  labor  in \nPakistan  to  undertake  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities  related  to  this  sensitive  issue.  The  NGO  could  work  with \nhouseholds that participate in such practices, appropriate social welfare agencies, and employers or workshops that, \nin the course of pilot project development, have devised an exit strategy to end bonded labor practices.    \n \n\n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \nE. \n  \nItem \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\n \nThe  type  and  size  of  investments  anticipated  under  the \nProject  do  not  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement. \nThis  will  also  be  a  condition  for  any  financing  by  the \nProject. \n\nNone \n\nTo be ensured through the sector analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nthese  children  are  provided  with \n\nIt  will  be  a  condition  of  financing  by  the  Project  that  fair \nwages and safe working conditions are provided and that \nchild labor will not be used.

Safeguards  will  be  put \nin place to ensure that the health of people involved in the \nProject  is  not  comprised  by  the  type  of  investment \nactivities.  The  Project  will  also  not  finance  investments \nthat  have  a  deleterious  impact  on  the  environment. \nthrough \nInstitutional  capacities  will  be  strengthened \ncapacity-building and awareness-raising programs. \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 December 2005) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "PRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0167 \nPRs59.72 \n", " \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \nADB \nADP \n \nAHAN   \nAIT \n \nAKRSP \nBAAC   \n \nBDS \n \nBSF \n \nCP \n \nEA \n \nGEM \nICT \n \nJETRO \nMDP    \nMoIPSI \n \nMSE \n \nNGO \nNSF \n \nNSSP   \nNT \n \nNWFP  \nOTOP   \nPPMS   \nPSIC \n \nREMC  \nSME \n \nSMEDA \nSMESDP \nSOE \n \nTA \n \n \nTP \nTBIRD  \nUNIDO  \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgribusiness Development Project \nAik Hunar Aik Nagar \nAsian Institute of Technology \nAga Khan Rural Support Program \nBank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives \nbusiness development services \nBusiness Support Fund \nCharoen Pokphand \nExecuting agency \nGrowth with Equity in Mindanao \ninformation and communication technology \nJapan External Trade Organization \nmarket development preparation \nMinistry of Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives \nmicro- and small enterprise \nnongovernment organization \nNam Sai Farms \nNational Support Services Program \nNarai Technologies Co.
