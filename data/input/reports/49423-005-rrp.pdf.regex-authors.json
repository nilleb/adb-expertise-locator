THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Bangladesh Power System Enhancement and \nEfficiency Improvement Project. 1 The report also describes the proposed administration of a \ngrant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Bangladesh Power \nSystem  Enhancement  and  Efficiency  Improvement  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the grant. \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  enhance  the  coverage  and  improve  the  reliability  and \nefficiency  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  network,  to  facilitate  better  utilization  of  the \nexpanding power generation capacity to meet the growth in electricity demand across the \ncountry.2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 1971, when Bangladesh gained independence, only 3% of its population had access \nto electricity. By 2015, this had risen to about 72% with per capita electricity consumption \nreaching 371 kilowatt-hours per annum.3 The gross domestic product of Bangladesh has been \ngrowing at a rate of over 6% consistently during 2005\u20132015. Meeting the need for reliable and \naffordable electricity is a challenge for Bangladesh as it seeks to sustain economic growth and \nconsolidate its transition to middle-income country status by 2021.4 To support inclusive growth \nand development as well as the creation of more and better jobs, the government has set a \ntarget of electricity for all by 2021, and is working across the electricity generation, transmission, \nand distribution value chain to enhance improved delivery of electricity and meet the expected \ndemand of 19 gigawatts (GW) by 2021.5 \n \n4.  Increasing power generation capacity. Expensive liquid fuels, such as diesel and \nfurnace oil, have proliferated particularly since 2009 and contributed about 20% of the power \ngeneration  in  2015. This  increase  in  capacity  contributed  to  electricity  generation capacity \ncrossing 13 GW in 2015 (more than double the installed capacity in 2009) and ended the rolling \nblackouts in major cities. Between 2007 and 2015, retail electricity tariffs in Bangladesh have \nincreased by about 7.9% annually, but have been inadequate to cover the increased cost of \npower.6 In the generation subsector, long-term planning is focused on increasing the installed \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, \n2017\u20132019. Manila. ADB provided stand-alone small-scale project preparatory technical assistance Bangladesh \nPower System Enhancement and Efficiency Improvement Project for (TA 9083-BAN), which was approved on       \n9 March 2016 to support due diligence. This is complemented by due diligence studies under tranche 1 of the \nongoing  ADB.  2012.

Bangladesh is ranked 107th in the 2015 Global Competitiveness \nIndex ratings behind most South Asian countries on account of several factors, including infrastructure constraints. \n5  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. 2011. Power System Master Plan \n2010. Dhaka. An updated master plan is under preparation and expected to be finalized in 2017. \n6  The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) purchases all electricity and sells this to distribution utilities, \nincluding the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO) and the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board ", "2 \ngenerating capacity, including rehabilitation and efficiency improvement of the existing public \nsector  gas-fueled  power  plants  and  the  creation  of  inter-country  transmission  grid \ninterconnections. Bangladesh is also executing plans to set up imported liquefied natural gas \nterminals and gas and coal power plants. There are also investments planned in grid-connected \nand  off-grid  solar  power  generation.7 These  measures  support  scaling  up  and  diversifying \ngeneration capacity through a range of financing sources, including through the private sector. \nThis momentum in generation capacity growth is expected to be maintained, with about 7 GW of \ngeneration capacity to be installed by 2021. This would reduce dependence on liquid fuel \nsources and facilitate a transition to a lower cost trajectory for power purchase costs over the \nmedium term. \n \n5.  Strengthening  transmission  network  coverage.  The  Power  Grid  Company  of \nBangladesh Limited (PGCB) is responsible for the national transmission grid in Bangladesh. \nThe south-west part of Bangladesh is a high-growth-potential region for economic corridor \ndevelopment  as  well  as  a  location  for  multiple  power  plants.  There  is  one  existing \ninterconnection crossing the Padma River and connecting the eastern and western regions of \nBangladesh at 230 kilovolts (kV). A second high-voltage interconnection across the Padma \nRiver between the southwest regions and Dhaka would improve reliability and permit efficient \npower flows over the national transmission network. \n \n6.  Distribution system improvement in Dhaka. Dhaka city has been one of the major \nbeneficiaries  of  the  improved  power  availability  since  2010.  The  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nCompany  Limited  (DESCO)  services  about  half  the  city  and  surrounding  areas,  and  has \nprogressively reduced its distribution losses from 27.0% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2015, which places it \namong the best city-based utilities in South Asia. This has been achieved through a relentless \nfocus on reducing commercial losses and increasing the share of its medium voltage network. \nDESCO is now focusing on improving its ability to monitor and control its city distribution \nnetwork and improve the quality of customer service and network utilization. \n \n7.  Enhancement  of  rural  distribution  network.  Bangladesh\u2019s  rural  electrification \ncommenced in 1977 with a few rural areas electrified through a program supported by the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  through  the  Bangladesh  Rural \nElectrification Board (BREB), the highest rural electrification agency responsible for financing \nprocurement and technical oversight of the palli bidyut samitis (PBSs)8 that are responsible for \noperation, billing, and collection in rural areas. The rural electrification network, with about 15 \nmillion  customers,  accounts  for  over  42%  of  power  consumption  in  the  country  and  is \nresponsible for serving industries, irrigation, and domestic demand in rural areas. Distribution \nloss levels in rural areas are at about 12.5% in 2016, lower than the 15.0% loss level in 2009, \nand expected to reduce to about 10.0% by 2021, driven by investments in loss reduction and \nthe  recently  approved  plan  to  decentralize  and  manage  widespread  rural  operations  at  a \nregional level. Sales are growing at 11% annually, and about 0.5 million new consumers are \nbeing  connected  annually  to  the  rural  distribution  network.  To  meet  its  target  of  100% \nelectrification by 2021, the Government of Bangladesh has embarked on a large-scale rural \nelectrification program supported by development partners since 2011. The Japan International \n                                                                                                                                                       \n(BREB). The BPDB has not been able to pass on the full cost of liquid fuel power purchase to the distribution \nsector. \n7  Bangladesh has a successful program for off-grid electrification using solar home systems that has helped improve \naccess to electricity. Projects for large utility-scale grid-connected renewable energy are under consideration. \n8  At the end of fiscal year 2016, there were 77 PBSs or rural electricity cooperatives that purchase power from the \nBPDB and sell it to retail consumers at 33 kV and lower voltages. They are responsible for maintaining the \ndistribution infrastructure created by BREB. \n ", "3 \nCooperation  Agency  and  the  World  Bank  have  undertaken  upstream  high  voltage  rural \nelectrification projects. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is providing $100 million of \nfinancing for downstream last mile customer connections for rural electrification. BREB has \nsought assistance to enhance the midstream capacity of the rural electrification network as well \nas rehabilitate and improve sections of the network that are over 20 years old and using wooden \ndistribution  poles  with  low-capacity  conductors.  These  investments  are  needed  to  ensure \ndelivery of increasing requirement of power and meet customer demand in an efficient and \nreliable manner.  \n \n8.  Capacity development for sector planning and regulation.  Under the 7th Five Year \nPlan, over 8,400 circuit kilometers (km) of transmission lines and over 120,000 circuit km of \ndistribution lines are to be constructed and rehabilitated.9 The government expects that about \n90% of the population would be served through the grid by 2020. Capacity development of the \nsector  agencies  on  medium-term  transmission  planning,  distribution  system  planning,  loss \nmonitoring,  and  feasibility  studies  for  new  generation  projects;  and  to  consolidate  recent \nprogress on tariff regulations would be needed. \n \n9.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is a key development partner in the power sector of \nBangladesh and has been active in supporting investments in power generation, efficiency \nimprovement,  international  power  interconnections,  and  improvement  of  transmission  and \ndistribution networks. ADB has supported power generation capacity addition and cross-border \nconnectivity in  western Bangladesh. The project is aligned with  ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh, which highlights the need to strengthen the transmission \nand distribution network and improve access to electricity.10  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  will  be  100%  access  to  power  by  2021  and  improved  power  sector \nsustainability  in  Bangladesh  by  2030.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Perspective  Plan  of \nBangladesh, 2010\u20132021: Making Vision 2021 a Reality,11 and the Power System Master Plan \n2010 (footnote 5). The outcome will be improved access to efficient and reliable electricity \nsupply in Bangladesh. Performance indicators are in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs of the project are (i) national transmission network in southern Bangladesh, \nstrengthened by PGCB through the construction of a 174 km high-voltage, 400 kV transmission \nlink between southwest Bangladesh and Dhaka; (ii) distribution network improved in DESCO \nservice areas through design and installation of control systems; (iii) distribution network in rural \nareas of Bangladesh, including the capacity of end-users, improved to support increase in safe, \nefficient, and productive electricity usage in BREB service areas; and (iv) capacity in power \nsector  agencies  enhanced,  including  on  new  project  design  and  improved  regulatory \ncompliance.12 \n \n                                                \n9  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2015. 7th Five Year Plan, FY2016\u20132020: \nAccelerating Growth, Empowering Citizens.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n17.  Technical due diligence was conducted on the project components. The feasibility report \nfor component 1, the transmission line, was prepared for PGCB by an external consultant and \nindependently reviewed. Component 2, the control system for DESCO, would support enhanced \ndistribution system management and improve the reliability of the distribution network. Under \nthe loan, the control system would be procured and implemented with international consulting \nsupport. Component 3, comprising the physical investments in rural electrification, was prepared \nbased  on  feasibility  studies  undertaken  at  the  PBSs  by  consultants,  and  reviewed  and \naggregated at BREB. The reports were assessed during project preparation through on-ground \nsurveys and reviews. The rural electrification investments identified under the project are part of \nthe government\u2019s 7th Five Year Plan (footnote 9). A consulting firm would be appointed to \nmonitor implementation and to support loss reduction and improvement in reliability for BREB. \nComponent 4 covers priority sector studies through Power Division and rural electrification \ninitiatives for productive and safe energy usage and capacity building of utility staff through \nBREB. Climate change risk assessment is expected to be high as the project area is monsoon-\naffected, with a possibility of extreme weather events such as floods. The detailed design will \nreview and incorporate elements to address these risks. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.16 The gradual decline in the availability of domestic natural gas \nfor  the  power  sector  has  resulted  in  an  increased  dependence  on  smaller  projects  with \nexpensive liquid fuel (diesel, furnace oil) from 2007 to 2016. Liquid fuel now contributes 20% of \nthe power generation mix and a disproportionately high share of fuel expenses. The expansion \nplan for Bangladesh is based on base-load power plants and regional power connections. For \nthe PGCB investment, the economic benefit of the transmission link with southern Bangladesh \nwould be through resource cost savings on power generation and the improved reliability of the \ntransmission network. For DESCO, the economic benefit is derived from improved ability to \nreduce the number and duration of interruptions through the proposed investment. For BREB, \nbenefits include the reduction of system losses and increased electricity consumption by new \nand existing consumers. 17   \n \n19.  All costs and benefits have been expressed in constant 2016 prices. Capital costs and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs were taken from the financial data, with appropriate \nadjustments  to  remove  taxes  and  price  contingencies.  Components  1,  2,  and  3  were \neconomically viable when economic analyses were undertaken, resulting in economic internal \nrates of return of 14.5% (component 1), 13.6% (component 2), and 26.6% (component 3). The \noverall project provided an economic internal rate of return of 24.7%. The project is resilient to \nchanges in the parameters, including 10% increase in capital costs, 20% increase in O&M \ncosts, construction delays, cost increases, and combined changes. The analysis demonstrates \nthe economic feasibility of the project. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB.1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n17 ADB. 2013. Cost-Benefit Analysis for Development: A Practical Guide. Manila (Chapter 8: Appraising Electricity \nProjects). \n ", "7 \n20.  Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.18 Financial  viability  was  assessed  by \ncomparing the incremental costs and benefits of the project over the life of the project. The \nbenefits for PGCB are based on the electricity transported over the transmission assets valued \nusing the tariff set by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) and using the \napproved transmission tariff methodology.19 For DESCO, the benefits are from the creation of \nassets that earn returns for the company as per the BERC\u2019s tariff regulations. For BREB, the \nbenefits are from the increased sale of power to both new and existing consumers over the \nenhanced rural distribution network. \n \n21.  Costs used to determine the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) included the capital \ninvestment, O&M costs, taxes, and duties to install and operate the project. The estimated \nweighted average cost of capital is 1.8%. The FIRRs of components 1, 2 and 3 were calculated \nto be 3.5%, 4.6%, and 5.0%, while the FIRR of the total project was calculated to be 4.7% and \nexceeds the weighted average cost of capital. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse changes in \nthe underlying assumptions was also assessed and the project is considered financially viable. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Executing agencies were assessed on ADB\u2019s procurement and financial management \nrequirements. PGCB, DESCO and BREB have ongoing ADB and other donor-funded projects. \nPower  Cell,  an  arm  of  the  Power  Division  has  undertaken  recruitment  of consultants  and \nsupported coordinating capacity building under previous donor-funded projects, including ADB. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. Procurement contracts financed by ADB \nare subject to prior ADB review and include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, PGCB, BREB, DESCO, and the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, \nEnergy and Mineral Resources. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n24.  The financial management risk is considered substantial and an action plan has been \nprepared  to  address  this.  The  BERC  and  the  government  made  effective  the  electricity \ntransmission and distribution tariff regulations in June 2016. This establishes a transparent \nmechanism for the periodic review and reset of tariffs to cover costs and improve the financial \nsustainability of the PGCB, DESCO, and BREB. PGCB and DESCO are listed on the Dhaka \nStock  Exchange  and  their  financial  parameters  are  disclosed  quarterly.  BREB  is  a \nsemiautonomous body operating under the BREB 2013 Act approved by Parliament. The BREB \nboard has been expanded to bring in additional expertise, and it is undertaking a restructuring \nby setting up eight zones to manage the decentralization of operations. The project would \nsupport enhancing capacity for internal controls, tariff-setting, asset-mapping, and monitoring of \nADB-supported investments. All executing agencies have executed similar projects previously \nand are capable of managing funds flow, disbursement procedures, accounting, and financial \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2005.

Counterpart  funds  and  their  terms  and  conditions  from  the \ngovernment to the executing agencies have been approved.20 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Bangladesh is the eighth most populated country in the world with a population of \naround 160 million. Nearly 47% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture. The rate of poverty \nreduction has accelerated with extreme poverty declining significantly in both urban and rural \nareas, with the proportion of rural population living in extreme poverty dropping from 44% in \n1992 to 21% in 2010. This can be attributed to more rapid gross domestic product growth, faster \nrate of urbanization, rising labor productivity and wages, a shift from low-return agricultural labor \nto nonfarm employment, and growth in export industries. \n \n26.   The Perspective Plan of Bangladesh, 2010\u20132021 (footnote 11) outlines a target of per \ncapita electricity consumption of 600 kilowatt-hours per year by 2021. To achieve this, sufficient \nelectrical power at affordable prices is a key prerequisite and is enunciated in the goal for \nelectricity access. The project, particularly the component on rural electrification, will enhance \nreliable access to electricity and contribute to economic growth in rural areas. About 875,000 \nhouseholds  will  benefit  from  the  distribution  investments  by  2020,  with  a  broad  range  of \nindividual and household level impacts accruing to women and children. In addition, under the \nproposed grant, support will be provided to develop new energy-based businesses in rural \nareas, including those led by women. Support for improved safety and awareness for the \nefficient use of electricity will target end-users who tend to be mostly women and address their \nspecific concerns. The project will generate jobs for local communities during construction and \noperation o f the physical infrastructure and adopt gender targets to promote women's equitable \nparticipation in project related employment opportunities, including in areas such as GIS and \nasset  mapping.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  given  the  above \ninterventions.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  The project outputs were assessed for their environmental and social impacts. For the \n400 kV transmission line, a total of 865 hectares of land would be temporarily affected under the \nright-of-way.  Social  surveys  undertaken  along  the  right-of-way  showed  that  no  physical \ndisplacement was envisaged and the impact was not significant. The economic impact due to \nthe loss of crops and trees would be compensated. The transmission line may cross over 18 \nhouseholds and PGCB has agreed to flexibility in route alignment and positioning of individual \ntowers to reduce the impact on these households. Potential environmental impacts are mostly \ntemporary, predictable, and reversible; and can be mitigated through adherence to national and \ninternational standards, design criteria, and implementation of the environmental management \nplans  (EMPs).  The  transmission  towers  across  the  Padma  River  will  be  constructed  on \nplatforms (associated facilities) provided by the Bangladesh Bridge Authority under an ongoing \nproject and due diligence on the approved environmental impact assessment report found it to \nbe in compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). A covenant is included to \nfacilitate verification of the mitigation measures for the platforms. Due diligence has confirmed \nthat the land required for receiving bays at the Aminbazar site is in the possession of PGCB, \nand no resettlement impacts are expected. The DESCO component would be based in the \nexisting  premises  of  the  DESCO  building  and  would  have  minimal  environmental  and \nresettlement impacts. \n                                                \n20 Executive Committee of the National Economic Council clearance received for PGCB, DESCO, and BREB \ninvestments in November 2016. \n ", "9 \n28.   The impact of the rural electrification component is expected to be minor. Rehabilitation \nof existing 33 kV, 11 kV, and 230-volt (V) lines would require replacement of old infrastructure \nwith new poles, conductors, and insulators. The work would be taken up on road sides and \nalong existing rights-of-way and there could be temporary disruption during installation and \nrehabilitation. BREB and the PBSs will follow national waste disposal regulations and put in \nplace  mechanisms  to  handle  waste,  including  used  oil,  wood,  ceramic  insulators,  and \nconductors. The distribution line extensions at low voltages (230 V and 400 V) would require \nextensions of not more than 100 meters and would not require displacement of people or impact \nproperty, and there is flexibility on the location of new poles. Construction of PBS buildings \nwould be on land owned by PBS. BREB has implemented similar projects with other bilateral \nand multilateral agencies. The capacity-building component would not cause safeguard impacts. \n \n29.   Environment approvals were received for the project components in 2016. Based on \nsocial assessments, no indigenous peoples are expected to be affected by the project. Surveys, \nand consultations conducted for subprojects did not identify any indigenous peoples territories \nor their natural and cultural resources within the boundaries earmarked for construction of the \nproject  components.  Based  on  due  diligence,  the  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the \nenvironment, category B for involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous people. \nThe project safeguard impacts have been adequately assessed and mitigation measures and \nentitlement matrix have been developed commensurate to the impacts. Consultations were \nundertaken at project locations, and views and opinions received taken into consideration. Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  including  EMPs  and  a  resettlement  plan  have  been \nprepared following the Safeguard Policy Statement and Bangladesh regulations. The EMPs and \nresettlement  plan  budgets  have  been  approved  and  are  sufficient  to  ensure  the  proper \nimplementation of mitigation and monitoring measures. They will be updated as necessary if \nunanticipated  impacts  are  identified  during  implementation.  The  executing  agencies  will \nestablish  a grievance  redress mechanism. The  executing  agencies  have  the  capacity  and \ncommitment to manage the social and environmental risks. The safeguard documents  are \ndisclosed on the ADB website. The implementation of the EMP and the resettlement plan will be \nmonitored  by  the  executing  agencies,  and  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB \nsemiannually. In the event of any change during implementation, executing agencies would \nupdate the initial environmental examinations, including the EMP and the resettlement plans. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 Based on an overall assessment, the \nbenefits and impact from the project outweigh the costs. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nNon-timely availability of counterpart funds  Apex government approvals for BREB projects were received in \nfor BREB   November 2016. \nInadequate  increase in wheeling charges  Notification of tariff regulations by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory \nfor transmission and distribution charges to  Commission in June 2016 allows utilities to file periodically for tariff \nmeet revenue requirements and the  increases.
