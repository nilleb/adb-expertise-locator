An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken and the summary circulated to the Board of Directors \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and made public through \nthe ADB website on 17 August 2007. \n   \nProject Description  The  Government  of  Mongolia  is  proposing  to  develop  a \n748.4-kilometer  road  corridor  through  the  western  region  of \nMongolia connecting Yarant at the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) border to Ulaanbaishint at the Russian Federation border \nvia Hovd and Olgiy, the aimag centers. Making up a portion of \nAsian Highway 4 and a component of the larger United Nations \nEconomic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific-\ndesignated  Asian  Highway  Network,  the  road  corridor  will  link \nMongolia  with  both  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation, \nfacilitating the flow of goods and passengers between the three \ncountries. Due to capacity constraints such as availability of grant \nfunds,  the  proposed  road  corridor  will  be  developed  in  two \nphases. Under the Project, a 431.2-kilometer road from the PRC \nborder  to  Hovd  aimag  (province)  center  will  be  developed  as \nphase I. Phase II will develop a road from Hovd aimag center to \nthe  Russian  border.  The  Project  includes  (i)  road  safety \nimprovement;  (ii)  community  development  to  maximize  the \nproject\u2019s poverty reduction impact; (iii) awareness and prevention \nof HIV/AIDS and human trafficking on the road corridor; (iv) pilot \nproject on improvements to the road maintenance system; and \n(v) capacity  building  of  the  Ministry  of  Roads,  Transport  and \nTourism (MRTT) and its provincial counterparts.  \n   \nRationale  The proposed road corridor will strengthen Mongolia\u2019s transport \nlinks to the PRC and the Russian Federation as well as other \ncountries in the region. The Project supports ADB\u2019s strategy for \nMongolia,  which  focuses  on  promoting  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  and  social  development  by  allowing  for  more  market \nintegration  and  movement  of  people,  resulting  in  broader \neconomic  growth  and  reducing  geographic  isolation,  thereby \nreducing poverty. The Project also supports ADB\u2019s strategy for the \nCentral Asian region, which is designed to (i) secure access to \nprofitable markets in large neighboring countries for exports from \nthe  Central  Asian  republics;  (ii)  reduce  transaction  costs  and \n ", "ii \nfacilitate  transit  and  transport  across  the  region;  (iii)  improve \nenergy supplies for sustaining growth; and (iv) mitigate negative \nregional  outcomes,  such  as  environmental  degradation, \ndesertification,  human  and  drug  trafficking,  and  the  spread  of \ncommunicable diseases. \n   \nThe  Project  supports  Mongolia\u2019s  priority  development  plan  of \nbuilding  roads  for  the  Asian  Highway  under  the  national \ndevelopment  strategy,  which  is  based  on  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. As part of the Asian Highway Network, the \nproject road will serve as an important route for domestic and \ninternational traffic. The proposed road corridor will also facilitate \nsustainable economic growth in the two most western aimags of \nMongolia (Hovd and Bayan-Olgiy), which had a poverty rate of \n38.7% in 2006; compared with the national average of 32.2% and \n20.4% in Ulaanbaatar. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  promotion  of  regional \ntransport  of  freight  and  passengers  via  the  Western  Regional \nRoad Corridor and increased economic development and regional \ntrade. The outcome of the Project will be an efficient and safe \nregional  transport  route  developed  in  the  western  region  of \nMongolia to link Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the PRC \nand Siberia in the Russian Federation through Hovd and Bayan-\nOlgiy aimags of western Mongolia. As part of Asian Highway 4, \nthe road will help link Mongolia with the rest of Asia. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $112.22 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $10.06 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Source  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  37.60  33.5 \nGovernment of Mongolia  74.62  66.5 \nTotal  112.22  100.0 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A grant equivalent to $37.6 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nremaining cost of the Project.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 October 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 April 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \n ", "iii \nImplementation  A project implementation unit will be set up under the Department \nArrangements  of  Roads  of  MRTT  to  take  responsibility  for  implementation \nactivities. The unit will be headed by a project director, who will be \nassisted by a full time project manager and a team of qualified \ntechnical, financial, and administrative staff. \n   \nExecuting Agency  MRTT \n   \nProcurement  Goods and works financed by the ADB grant will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Civil works for the project road will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Equipment will \nbe procured through national competitive bidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  finance  92.5  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services: 16 for detailed design, 72 for construction \nsupervision, and 4.5 for other services. The detailed design period \nis anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2008 and last for the \nentire year. The construction supervision consulting services will \nbe required from the middle of the second quarter of 2009 and \nextend through the completion of the road defects liability period \nat  the  end  of  the  third  quarter  of  2013.  The  Government  will \nfinance consulting services for detailed design, while ADB will \nfinance  the  construction  supervision  consulting  services.  The \nADB-financed consultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-\nbased selection (80% technical and 20% financial weighting) and \nfull technical proposal, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will (i) improve the transport network in the region, \nBeneficiaries  allowing residents easier, less expensive, and faster access to \nsocial, health, and other services; (ii) increase the annual regional \ngross domestic product of Hovd aimag to 6% after completion of \nthe  Project;  (iii)  help  increase  regional  transit  trade  tonnage \nthrough Mongolia\u2019s western region by 25% by 2014; and (iv) help \nincrease trade between the western region and the PRC and the \nRussian  Federation  by  15%  by  2013.  Income  of  targeted \nparticipants of the Project is expected to increase 10% annually. \nThe expected results of the Project include (i) reduced travel time \nfrom Yarant to Hovd aimag center by 3 hours by 2013, (ii) reduced \naverage border processing times for goods and passengers at \nYarant by 1 hour by 2013, and (iii) traffic volume at the Yarant \nborder  increased  by  15%  annually  from  2012  to  2015.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is 16.3%. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit road users, including passengers, \ntraders, and transport providers, as well as local economies and \nlabor. The environment of the region will be improved through \nreduction of dust generated by vehicles traveling over earth roads \nand elimination of multiple earthen tracks that currently exist along \nthe proposed alignment. A considerable number of jobs will be \n ", "iv \ncreated by upgrading the road and provide the opportunity for \npoor households to exit poverty status. About 2,300 total jobs will \nbe created for the road upgrade during construction. Of these, \nnearly 1,300 jobs will be for unskilled workers. Assuming that 80% \nof  unskilled  workers  will  be  hired  from  local  poor  households, \n1,040 unskilled jobs will be available. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project is formulated to reduce technical, economic, financial, \nsafety, and social risks. The main technical risks are associated \nwith road construction in the area of Bodonch Canyon. The road \nalignment has been modified to mitigate this risk and allow for \neasier  road  construction.  During  construction,  monitoring  and \ncontract management information systems will be set up to quickly \nidentify and correct any technical problems. The contractors will \nbe required to strictly enforce work safety rules and measures. \nThe  extreme  climate  of  Mongolia\u2019s  western  region  also  poses \nrisks for construction and the long-term durability of materials. \n \nMaintenance  of  the  project  road  after  completion  may  be \ninadequate due to insufficient funding. This risk will be mitigated \nmainly through the introduction of a road user fee at the PRC \nborder. A similar fee will be enforced at the Russian border after \ncompletion of phase II. Based on the traffic projections, the fee \ncollected is adequate for annual maintenance of the project road. \nHowever,  the  financial  risk  associated  with  construction  and \noperation of the project road will depend on traffic volume and the \nsigning of a tripartite agreement between Mongolia, the PRC, and \nthe Russian Federation related to transit trade. The roughness \nindex  of  the  road  should  be  3.0  immediately  following \nconstruction.  In  addition,  routine,  periodic,  and  rehabilitation \nmaintenance works will be required to ensure the roughness index \ndoes not exceed 4.5. \n \nThe Project does not involve any resettlement and has adequate \nmitigation  and  monitoring  mechanisms  in  place  to  minimize \nenvironmental impacts.  \n \n ", "96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nMONGOLIA\nWESTERN REGIONAL ROAD CORRIDOR\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT,\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\nPHASE I\nHanh\n50 oU 0la0a'Nnbatoi Nsohvoisnbirtsk Ulaangom Hatgal 50 o 00'N\nUVS Altanbulag\nHOVSGOL\nDaTysaenngel Nogoonnuur Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSuhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Olgiy Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Hutag-Ondor Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD Havirga\nHovd ZAVHAN Bulgan ORHONSumber\nARHANGAY ULAANBAATAR HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Uliastay Tsahir BattsHeisnhgiegl Ondor Lun ULAANBAABTaAgRanuur Batnorov\nDariv TOV Nalayh Tamsagbulag\nHOVD Tayshir Tsetserleg Zuunmod Maanit Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad\nYarant Harhorin\nTakeshiken GOVISUMBER\nUyench Altay Bayanhongor Choyr Baruun-Urt\nto Urumqi TogroGgOVI-ALTAY Buutsagaan Nariynteel Arvayheer Mandalgovi SUHEBrAdeAnTetAsaRgaanBichigt\nOVORHANGAY\nDUNDGOVI Saynshand\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nPEOPOLEF' S C  HRIENPAUBLIC Tsogt-Ovoo DORNOGOZaVmIyn-Uudto Beijing\nDalanzadgad\nWestern Region\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Bayan-Ovoo National Capital 42 o 00'N\nProvincial Capital\nGashuun Suhayt\nCity/Town\nADB-Financed Road\nN Proposed Road Corridor - Phase I\nProposed Road Corridor - Phase II\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nRoad\nOF  CHINA \n0 50 100150200250 Railway\nRiver\nKilometers\nProvincial Boundary\n0 International Boundary\n7\n-2 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  Mongolia  for  the  Western  Regional  Road  Corridor  Development  Project\u2013Phase  I  (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Mongolia has a relatively large land mass and small population, resulting in one of the \nlowest population densities in the world; less than 1.5 per square kilometer in most of the \ncountry. Due to its large geographic area and relatively low population density, Mongolia\u2019s \ntransport  system  is  generally  not  well  developed.  Residents  of  remote  rural  areas  lack \nreasonable access to markets and social services, and are isolated from the country\u2019s political \nand economic centers due to the poor road network. Within Mongolia, the far western aimags1 \nare the most affected. \n \n3.  Furthermore, Mongolia\u2019s geographic location, far from the sea and surrounded by two \nlarge neighbors\u2014the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation\u2014makes \nexternal transport links via these countries very significant in terms of Mongolia\u2019s international \ntrade. A detailed road subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. To create favorable conditions to \naccess the sea, improve the efficiency of transit transportation through the territory of foreign \ncounties, and increase transit transportation through Mongolia, the Government of Mongolia \n(the Government) has decided to build key roads within Mongolia. The Government\u2019s national \ndevelopment strategy based on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) identifies three \nmain road corridors as priority projects for development; all are sections of the Asian Highway \nNetwork.2 The proposed road corridor, which is part of Asian Highway 4 (AH4), between Yarant \nat the PRC border and Ulaanbaishint at the Russian border, is one of the priority development \nprojects for Mongolia and is included in national and regional3 development plans. The Project \nwill develop the road section from Yarant to Hovd aimag center on the proposed road corridor. \n \n4.  The Asian Highway Network is a system of 141,000 kilometers (km) of standardized \nroads crossing 32 Asian countries with linkages to Europe and Central Asia endorsed by the \nUnited  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  AH4  will  join \nMongolia initially with the PRC and the Russian Federation, and then continue to link the \ncountry with neighboring Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan. The proposed cross-\nborder linkage will help Mongolia improve its trade with Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of \nthe PRC (Xinjiang) and Siberia in the Russian Federation. It will also help to improve tourism \nand tourism-related businesses in western Mongolia. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n5.  Road Network in Mongolia. Mongolia\u2019s road network, including both state and local \nroads, totals approximately 49,250 km connecting 21 major cities and towns and 160 smaller \nvillages (soums [local administrative area] and bags [local administrative subdivisions]). Of this \ntotal, state roads account for 11,219 km, and aimag and local roads for 38,031 km. Most \nMongolian roads are gravel and earth; approximately 3.5% of the road network is paved. \n                                                 \n1  Provinces. \n2  Government of Mongolia. 2007. Report on Needs Assessment for Millennium Development Goal Achievement in \nMongolia. Ulaanbaatar. \n3  Government of Mongolia. 2005. Western Region Development Plan. Ulaanbaatar (Summary of the plan is given as \nSupplementary Appendix H). \n ", "2 \n6.  Within the western region, transport infrastructure is limited. Within the two most western \naimags, Bayan-Olgiy allocates 0.31% of its land for the formal transportation network and Hovd \nallocates 0.2%. These percentages do not take into account the large number of unofficial earth \ntracks. As demonstrated by an analysis of the current makeup of the road alignment, of the \n748.4 km of the proposed road corridor, 104.3 km are gravel, 181.2 km are improved road \n(earth tracks that have been graded or received some kind of improvement), and 370.35 km are \nearth tracks. Only 92.55 km are asphalt, which includes 64 km of road recently constructed4 \nfrom the Mongolia-PRC border. The project impact area of phase I comprises Hovd aimag. \n \n7.  Road Subsector Financing. The road subsector is financed from the state budget and \nthree types of road funds: State Road Fund, 21 local (aimag) road funds, and Urban Road \nFund.  In  accordance  with  the  1995  Law  on  Fuel  Tax  on  Gasoline  and  Diesel,  road  fund \nrevenues comprise (i) allocations of a part of fuel taxes on gasoline and diesel; (ii) state budget \nallocations;  and  (iii)  other  donations  and  contributions  such  as  private  donations  to  the \nMillennium Road, fines, fees, and miscellaneous revenue. However, only the State Road Fund \nreceives an allocation from the fuel taxes collected; the other two types of funds depend entirely \non vehicle licensing taxes and allocations from aimag or municipal governments. \n \n8.  In recent years, State Road Fund revenues have not been sufficient to meet the needs \nof the Department of Roads of the Ministry of Roads, Transport and Tourism (MRTT). In 2005, \nMNT22.18 billion were allocated to the State Road Fund. In 2004, 1.4% of Mongolia\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP) was allocated to the State Road Fund, but less than 0.3% of the GDP \nwas used for maintaining the existing network, although about 1.0% was estimated to be \nnecessary. Furthermore, of the road funds\u2019 expenditures, maintenance makes up only about \n25% of the allocations. The rest is spent on new construction and, in the case of the State Road \nFund, counterpart financing for projects funded by international financing institutions.5 External \nassistance to roads in Mongolia is outlined in Appendix 3. \n \n9.  Project Area. Hovd aimag has an area of 76,300 square kilometers and a population of \n91,687.6 The altitude varies between 1,142 meters (m) and 3,750 m. Hovd and Bayan-Olgiy \naimags share a similar climate and set of challenges associated with road construction. Within \nHovd aimag, the main economic subsector is animal husbandry, with 1.96 million head of \nlivestock in the region. After construction of the project road, this subsector can be improved \nwith the availability of new transport facilities. At present, the region has few mining activities or \nchemical industries that emit air, water, or soil pollutants. \n \n10.  GDP and GDP Per Capita. Mongolia\u2019s five western aimags (of which two are crossed \nby the proposed road corridor)7 have a total population of approximately 400,000, representing \n16% of the nation\u2019s total. In 2005, this region had a gross regional product of $138 million, \nrepresenting 7.6% of Mongolia\u2019s overall GDP. In per capita terms, Mongolia\u2019s national GDP in \n2005 was $724 per person, in the western region GDP was $338 (footnote 6). The large and \nbooming economies of the PRC and the Russian Federation represent large opportunities for \neconomic growth in Mongolia through increased transit and trade. \n \n                                                 \n4  The standard of road construction was the same as that of the proposed project road. \n5  Asian Development Bank. 2007.

The overall poverty rate for Mongolia is approximately 32.2%; 37% in rural \nareas and 27.9% in urban. More than one third of the population of the western region (38.7%) \nis classified as poor; only 20.4% of Ulaanbaatar falls within the same category.8 Within the \ncountry, the west has one of the lowest rates of urbanization, the largest average household \nsize, and highest dependency ratio, which contribute to the comparatively high poverty.9 Within \nsoums located along or near the project alignment, a 2007 sample survey of 334 households \nindicates that 20.34% are poverty households, with average monthly income per capita ranging \nfrom MNT17,000 to MNT27,000.10 \n \n12.  Trade Flow. Overall foreign trade for Mongolia in 2005 amounted to $2.2 billion. The \nwestern region accounted for $24 million in exports ($5 million to the PRC and $15 million to the \nRussian Federation) and $53 million in imports ($20 million from the PRC and $25 million from \nthe Russian Federation). However, trade flow to the PRC is increasing at a faster rate and, at \npresent, traffic volume at the PRC border is more than three times the volume at the Russian \nborder. Among the regions, Xinjiang has more than $5 billion of exports and just under $3 billion \nof imports. At the same time, east-central Siberia has $21.1 billion of exports and $3 billion of \nimports. These numbers suggest a sizable potential in terms of western Mongolia\u2019s external \ntrade and transit trade between Xinjiang and east-central Siberia. \n \n13.  Potential  Development  Activities. A large number of  mineral deposits have been \nidentified in the western region. Most promising and commercially viable are coal deposits; an \nestimated reserve of more than 300 million tons is located near Hovd aimag (Khusheet). The \ncoal and other minerals mined may be exported to the PRC, the Russian Federation, or other \ncountries, resulting in increased foreign reserves and GDP, thereby positively impacting overall \neconomic  development  of  the  country.  The  creation  of  mine  sites  will  impact  surrounding \ncommunities. While the project road is not built to accommodate heavy dump trucks used by the \nmining industry and new mining projects will need to secure alternate sources of transport for \nmineral  resources,  no  development  activities  will  take  place  in  the  western  region  without \naccess to basic infrastructure facilities to support mining-related services. Services such as \nmedical facilities, small business enterprises, and other related establishments all need to be \nconstructed or expanded. Each of these will result in increased investment around the mine \nsites. These additional funds will support communities and provide much needed investment to \nincrease the living standards of residents. \n \n14.  Coal  can  be  used  for  a  wide  variety  of  domestic  purposes  that  positively  impact \ndevelopment. It can be used in power plants and to provide heating to cities, villages, and \nhouseholds throughout the western region. The soums nearby these mines may gain revenue \nas a direct result of mine operations, including land-use taxes and water-use fees. Taking into \naccount the fact that adequate transportation infrastructure must be in place to accommodate \nnew developments such as the establishment of industrial parks to support small and medium-\nsized  enterprises  in  the  region,  described  in  the  Western  Region  Development  Plan,  the \nproposed  road  may  result  in  the  generation  of  new  industries  and  establishment  of  new \norganizations that will increase revenue and employment for local communities. \n \n15.  Tourism. The Altai region along the project road is regarded as one of the few virgin or \nlittle-changed ecoregions in the world.11 Its uniqueness will attract more conventional tourism. \nVarious national parks, nature reserves, important bird habitat areas, a Ramsar site (convention \n                                                 \n8  National Statistics Office. 2007.

While infrastructure facilities to develop tourism in the western region are limited, this is \nlikely to change as travel becomes easier and more reliable. \n \n16.  Population  Growth. The upgraded road is likely to slow emigration and lead to a \npopulation increase in the project area as a result of enhanced employment opportunities. The \ndevelopment  of  trade,  tourism,  mining,  and  increased  agricultural  production  will  lead  to \neconomic growth. The annual rate of population increase is expected to be between 1.0% and \n1.5% in the project area. \n \n17.  Average Daily Traffic Flow. Along the proposed road corridor, traffic volume is higher \nin the south than in the north. Traffic counts indicate a wide range of average daily traffic \nvolume, from 371 near the Yarant border just prior to the border being closed for 2 weeks, to \n156  near  the  Russian  border.12 The  proposed  road  corridor  will  help  generate  additional \nbusiness activities in the western region and improve the region\u2019s growth rate. This will in turn \nhave a more positive impact on road traffic along the road corridor. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems and Constraints \n18.  The economic performance of the western Mongolia aimags has not been good in the \nlast few years, with per capita GDP in 2005 being less than half of the national average. This \nraises issues such as the incidence of poverty given the low average income of all Mongolia \neven in purchasing power parity terms. Agriculture (mostly livestock) makes up just over 20% of \nMongolia\u2019s economy, but more than 60% of western Mongolia\u2019s economy.13 The area has very \nlittle industry with the exception of meat processing and some small-scale mining, as well as a \nsmall tourism and hospitality industry. \n \n19.  In the without-the-road scenario, the economic performance of the western aimags will \ncontinue  to  lag  because  of  structural  weaknesses  and  infrastructure  shortcomings.  Out-\nmigration will continue both to Ulaanbaatar and to Kazakhstan, where ethnic Kazakhs of Bayan-\nOlgiy aimag have established relationships and the petroleum industry is booming. Xinjiang and \nparts of Siberia are also growing rapidly and may attract migrants from western Mongolia. Any \nsignificant  population  growth  is  unlikely  without  improvements  in  infrastructure  and  related \npolicy,  program,  and  project  changes.  Therefore,  the  new  paved  road  can  help  bring  the \ndevelopment potential of the region to reality. \n \n20.  Customs  Processing  Times.  At  the  Yarant  border  point,  clearance  times  are \napproximately 3.5 hours, often taking 2 hours on the PRC side and 1.5 hours on the Mongolian \nside. The primary causes of the difference in processing times relate to the relatively inadequate \nfacilities14 and different procedures applied by custom officials of the two countries. \n \n                                                 \n12 The Yarant border crossing at the Mongolia-PRC border is closed from 1 January to 15 April and is only open \nduring the last 15 days of the remaining months of the year. The Ulaanbaishint border is open all year. \n13 National Statistics Office. 2002\u20132006. Mongolian Statistical Yearbook. Ulaanbaatar. \n14 Currently, at Yarant, the PRC is constructing new customs and immigration facilities on the PRC side of the border. \n ", "    5 \n2.  Government and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n21.  Mongolia\u2019s landlocked location between the PRC and the Russian Federation, and its \nremoteness  from  developed  international  and  domestic  markets  are  major  constraints  to \ninternational development. The Government of Mongolia has identified increasing investment in \nroad construction and rehabilitation as a means to reduce the country\u2019s isolation from world \nmarkets and improve the accessibility of isolated communities. The Economic Growth Support \nand Poverty Reduction Strategy identifies this emphasis on road rehabilitation as one of the \nmain issues. Improving the Western Regional Road Corridor will be a large step forward in \nreducing geographic isolation within the region. \n \n22.  The  project  road  will  help  the  Government  meet  the  objectives  identified  within  its \nComprehensive National Development Strategy for Mongolia, which is based on the MDGs. \nAmong these objectives are expanding and developing the road network and connecting aimag \nand regional centers and the capital city by paved roads; improving the care and maintenance \nof  national  and  local  roads;  and  reducing  the  negative  impacts  of  road  vehicles  on  the \nsurrounding environment, population, and traffic movements.15 These goals and strategies are \nin line with the transport sector strategy for Mongolia developed with the assistance of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) (footnote 5).  \n \n23.  The  Project  supports  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy16 for  Mongolia  which  focuses  on \npromoting  stable  economic  growth  and  inclusive  social  development  by  allowing  for  more \nmarket integration and movement of people. This is to result in economic growth and reduced \ngeographic isolation, and thereby reduce poverty. The Project also supports the ADB strategy \nfor the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), which is designed to (i) secure \naccess to profitable markets in large neighboring countries for export from the Central Asian \nrepublics; (ii) reduce transaction costs and facilitate transit and transport across the region; \n(iii) improve energy supplies for sustaining growth; and (iv) prevent negative regional outcomes, \nsuch as environmental degradation, desertification, human and drug trafficking, and the spread \nof communicable diseases. The CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy endorsed by \nthe Ministerial Conference is based on six priority corridors that link various Eurasian regions \nand markets. By upgrading air, sea, road, and rail infrastructure and services in these priority \ncorridors along with those on secondary access routes, the cost and time of transporting goods \nand  people  will  be  reduced,  and  thus  the  competitiveness  of  CAREC  countries  improved, \nleading to higher sustainable economic growth and improved living standards. The project road \nis part of the CAREC transport corridor number four (AH4). \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2006\u20132008) for Mongolia reaffirms the need to \nimprove the accessibility of isolated communities addressed in the Economic Growth Support \nand Poverty Reduction Strategy. \n \n  3.  Lessons \n25.  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  performance  in  Mongolia\u2019s  road  subsector  has  been  generally \nsatisfactory. The first road project for rehabilitating the Altanbulag\u2013Ulaanbaatar section was \ncompleted in 2001 and rated as \u201chighly successful.\u201d17 Even with initial delays due to limited \n                                                 \n15 Millennium  Development  Goals  Based  Comprehensive  National  Development  Strategy  of  Mongolia.

It has experienced cost overruns due to the \n(i) increase in oil prices, which increased the cost of transporting construction materials in \nremote project sites; and (ii) substantial increase in the cost of construction materials in the \ninternational market. Loan savings from the second road project were transferred to the third \nproject to meet part of the cost overrun, and the Government undertook to finance the remaining \nbalance. Lessons from the third road project were considered when estimating the cost of the \nproposed Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The impact of the Project will be the promotion of regional transport of freight and \npassengers via the Western Regional Road Corridor and increased economic development and \nregional  trade.  The  outcome  will  be  an  efficient  and  safe  regional  transport  route  that  is \ndeveloped in the western region of Mongolia, linking Xinjiang in the PRC and Siberia in the \nRussian Federation, by way of Hovd and Bayan-Olgiy aimags in Mongolia. The project road \nrepresents a portion of the AH4, an internationally designated road by the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n27.  The growth of gross regional product for western Mongolia for 2003\u20132005 was around \n3%; less than 50% of the gross national product for Mongolia (7.5%) for the same period. Once \nthe Project is implemented, the gross regional product for western Mongolia is expected to \nincrease  at  rates  between  4.5%  and  7.0%  per  year  through  2035.  Additionally,  the  gross \nregional product per capita growth rates are anticipated to range between 4.5% and 5.6% over \nthe same time horizon. Employment opportunities will increase and out-migration will decline, \nresulting  in  an  annual  rate  of  population  increase  between  1.0%  and  1.5%.  If  additional \nimprovements are made to the border facilities, growth figures are expected to be even higher. \n \n28.  In addition to stimulating economic growth within Hovd aimag, the aims of project road \nconstruction include (i) regional transit trade tonnages increase by 25% during 2007\u20132014 and \n(ii)  trade  between  the  western  region  and  the  PRC  increases  by  15%  during 2007\u20132014. \nSpecific goals relating to transport of passengers and freight along the route include (i) average \nspeed on the road increases from 40 km per hour to 60 km per hour by 2013; (ii) travel time \nfrom  Yarant  to  Hovd  aimag  center  decreases  by  3  hours  by  2013;  (iii)  average  border \nprocessing times for goods and passengers at Yarant decreases by 1 hour by 2013, and \n(iv) traffic volume at the Yarant border increases by 15% annually from 2012 to 2015. \n \nB.  Outputs \n29.  Main Road. A 748.4 km road stretching from Yarant at the Mongolia and PRC border to \nUlaanbaishint at the Mongolia and Russian border will be developed in two phases. Under \nphase I, a 431.2 km road from Yarant to Hovd aimag center will be developed. The output for \nthe Project will be the improvement of a 431.2 km road between Yarant and Hovd aimag center. \nThe  road  will  be  built  to  Mongolian  category  III  road  standards  (determined  by  the  traffic \nvolume), with two lanes and a cross section consisting of carriageway widths of 3.5 m and \nshoulder widths of 1.5\u20132.0 m. This proposed cross section meets the requirements of class II \nroads of the Asian Highway Network (Appendix 4). Implementation of civil works will begin in the \nsecond quarter of 2009 for the first construction package of the project road (Bodonch Canyon \n ", "    7 \narea) and be completed at the end of the first quarter of 2012. Project road construction will \nbegin in the south and move north, thereby constructing the most heavily traveled sections first. \n \n30.  Maintenance Centers. Due to its relative isolation and low road network density, road \nmaintenance management and equipment capability are limited in the project impact area. \nThree road maintenance centers will be established along the project road (approximately one \nevery  100  km).  In  addition,  facilities  at  the  existing  maintenance  center  will  be  upgraded \n(Appendix 5). The maintenance centers will be tasked with the upkeep of the road, keeping it \nfree  from  debris,  potholes,  excess  snow,  and  other  hazards  to  drivers  and  vehicles.  The \ninternational roughness index of the road is not to exceed a value of 4.5. Activities of the new \nmaintenance centers will be undertaken along the project road according to a set schedule to \nensure that benefits resulting from decreased vehicle operating costs and fuel savings continue. \n \n31.  Equipment.  To  adequately  maintain  the  surface  of  the  project  road,  the  newly \nestablished road maintenance centers will procure new equipment to supplement the equipment \nof  the  existing  road  maintenance  center.  This  new  equipment  includes  a  grader,  bitumen \nspreaders, excavator, asphalt concrete cutter, and moving water tank. In addition, the Project \nwill provide and install two weigh scales near the PRC border and Hovd aimag center to control \nvehicle  axle  weight  on  the  project  road.  The  Project  will  also  provide  a  vehicle  scanning \nmachine and related equipment for the Yarant border crossing point at the PRC border to \nreduce the custom processing time. Equipment to monitor environmental impact and control \noverloading will be also procured under the Project (Appendix 6). \n \n32.  Road Safety. Following the upgrade of the road, vehicle speeds are likely to increase, \nresulting in greater potential for accidents. To mitigate against this and other hazards, measures \nsuch as the installation of guardrails where necessary, road signs, pavement markings, rest \nareas, and kilometer posts are proposed. Additionally, the project road will be designed to \nimprove sight distances, providing drivers with more advance warning of obstacles on the road \nor approaching vehicles. Strict enforcement of axle-load limits for trucks traveling along the \nproject road will improve road safety, as well as extend the life of the road surface. Road safety \naudits at the detailed design and preopening stages will be undertaken to secure road safety on \nthe project road (Appendix 7). \n \n33.  Community Development. Along the alignment, community development projects will \nbe undertaken to improve the standard of living and reduce poverty in the project impact area. \nParticipants in stakeholder meetings suggest that training, such as in driving to secure truck \ndriving  jobs  at  mines  to  be  developed,  be  provided  to  the  unemployed.  Another  common \nsuggestion is to provide drinking water wells near soum centers for easier access to clean \ndrinking water. ADB will review the submissions to determine which community development \nprojects would have the greatest impact and be most suitable under project funding. \n \n34.  A  $2.0  million  grant  proposal  for  community-based  local  road  upgrading  and \nmaintenance in the western region of Mongolia is currently being prepared using seed money \nfrom  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR).  This  grant  would  supplement  the \nimprovement of the project road and result in many local residents being trained in proper \nmaintenance  techniques  and  standards.  Following  completion  of  the  JFPR  project,  these \nindividuals  could  be  employed  by  the  regional  maintenance  units,18 thereby  utilizing  their \nknowledge and training on the project road, further stimulating the local economy. \n \n                                                 \n18 Each maintenance center is expected to employ approximately 50 workers. \n ", "8 \n35.  HIV/AIDS.  Utilizing  outputs  developed  under  a  previous  ADB-funded  technical \nassistance (TA)19 in Mongolia, the Project will include an HIV/AIDS20 and sexually transmitted \ninfection (STI) training and information component. In the earlier TA, materials were created to \ninform local residents and construction workers of the dangers associated with HIV/AIDS and \nSTI and their transmission. These will be transferred to employees of the Project at no cost by \nthe civil works contractors. \n \n36.  Capacity Building. Increasing the length of paved roads requires increased capacity \nand  institutional  strengthening  of  road  administrators  to  secure  road  safety,  to  keep  road \ninfrastructure in good condition, and to provide better services. The Project will support capacity \nbuilding for road maintenance by strengthening financial mechanisms including user charges for \nroad  maintenance,  and  improving  the  institutional  framework  and  organizations  for  road \nmanagement and technical skills of road administrators of the central and local governments. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  capacity  building  to  prevent  overloading  issues,  including \n(i) enforcing the new overloading regulation, (ii) strengthening organizations for enforcement of \nregulations by MRTT inspectors with support of traffic police, (iii) funding two weigh scales, and \n(iv) providing training for road administrators and traffic police. Capacity building assistance will \nbe provided to MRTT, the Executing Agency, for out-of-country training for staff to gain practical \nexperience in road construction and maintenance. \n \nC.  Special Features \n37.  Regional Cooperation. As a large landlocked country, Mongolia depends on its two \nneighbors, the PRC and the Russian Federation, for access to world markets and economic \ndevelopment.  The  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  dominate  Mongolia\u2019s  external  trade. \nHowever, lack of roads leading to the PRC and the Russian Federation is a constraint. The \nmajority of Mongolia\u2019s external trade is carried on the existing north\u2013south rail line, which \nconnects Suhbaatar at the border with the Russian Federation and Zamyn-Uud at the border \nwith the PRC. The ongoing road development along the rail line (footnote 19) will help improve \nMongolia\u2019s flexibility and limited capacity to handle exports and imports with its neighbors. Even \nafter this development, Mongolia will have only one paved road corridor connecting north and \nsouth. To improve its trade and tourism, Mongolia needs a number of similar road corridors. The \nWestern  Regional  Road  Corridor  is  considered  as  the  next  most  important  trade  link  to \nMongolia.  \n \n38.  The Project will develop a part of Mongolia\u2019s second north\u2013south paved road corridor \nlink, which is part of the Asian Highway Network. The route is identified as AH4. From the north, \nthe AH4 will connect western Mongolia to Barnaul and Novosibirsk in east-central Siberia in the \nRussian Federation and from the south it will connect to Urumqi in Xinjiang. Moving westward \nfrom both Barnaul and Xinjiang, the AH4 will connect to several other AH roads that will link with \nCentral Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic. These connections will help \nto link western Mongolia to the entire region.  \n \n39.  The CAREC program is also playing a key role in improving the region\u2019s infrastructure \nand facilitating trade in western Mongolia. Mongolia\u2019s participation in this organization and the \nproximity of other members that are experiencing strong economic growth cycles (e.g., the PRC \nand Kazakhstan) provide increased opportunities for both interregional and international trade. \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2004.

Transport has become a key \ncomponent of the CAREC Comprehensive Action Plan adopted in October 2006. Following this, \nCAREC confirmed the designation of the AH4 as a CAREC priority transport corridor so that it \nwill receive priority for CAREC trade facilitation support.21 \n \n40.  The main outcome of the Project will be an efficient and safe regional transport route \ndeveloped in Mongolia to link it with both the PRC and the Russian Federation, facilitating the \nflow  of  goods  and  passengers  between  the  three  countries.  As  stated  earlier,  the  Project \nsupports the ADB strategy for Central Asia and is part of the CAREC infrastructure development \nprogram.  \n \n41.  Policy Dialogue. In 2005, ADB provided TA22 to MRTT to prepare a national transport \nstrategy. The TA was completed in mid-2006 and the strategy was updated in March 2007 to \nreflect MRTT\u2019s current plans. The transport strategy covers all subsectors such as road, rail, \nand air. In parallel, MRTT has prepared a 15-year investment plan that, to a limited extent, \ndraws on the strategy. \n \n42.  The Government of Mongolia is committed to the United Nations\u2019 MDGs and is preparing \nan MDG-based comprehensive national development strategy for 2007\u20132021. The strategy is to \npromote  the  welfare  of  the  Mongolian  people  and  combines  macroeconomic  and  sector \nstrategies  with  crosscutting  concerns,  including  governance,  human  development, \nenvironmental protection, research and development, and knowledge management. It is based \non an assessment of achievement of the MDGs,23 and is being drafted under the auspices of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  has  invited  development  agencies  to  actively  participate  in \nstrategy formulation. Progress on the strategy is reviewed twice a year by technical partner \nmeetings,  to  which  all  major  development  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  are \ninvited. More specifically, sector working groups formed to support formulation of the national \ndevelopment strategy are called upon to report to the technical partner meetings on the status \nof their work. The Ministry of Finance asked ADB to cochair the sector working group on \ntransport, with MRTT acting as chair.  \n \n43.  As cochair of the Transport Sector Working Group, ADB conducted workshops and a \nnumber of working group meetings to facilitate preparation of the transport sector action plan. \nThe other main objectives of these workshops were to strengthen strategic planning in transport \nsector activities, and to discuss the viability of investment proposals presented by MRTT up to \n2021 and to prioritize projects. As an outcome of the meetings, a 4-year rolling plan is to be \nprepared for the sector. MRTT has, in principle, agreed to the need to introduce these strategic \ndirections  in  its  planning  process.  As  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  under  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  agrees  to  establish  a  dedicated  policy  and  planning  division  within  MRTT. \nHowever, MRTT is reluctant to scale down its investment plan and is updating the National \nTransport Sector Strategy. ADB will continue its efforts to encourage MRTT to follow a strategic \ndirection and formulate relevant policies in the transport sector.  \n \n44.  ADB has continued policy dialogue with the Government on road subsector financing \nand maintenance during preparation of the Project. The Government has agreed to introduce a \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2007. A Trade Facilitation Strategy for CAREC: Preliminary Draft. Manila. \n22 ADB. 2004.

The Government also \nagreed to introduce necessary regulations to control vehicle axle weight on the project road to a \nmaximum weight of 10 tons per axle to prevent overloaded vehicles entering the project road. \nThis policy dialogue will continue as part of negotiations for the proposed grant. \n \n45.  Impact on Local Communities. The Project is formulated to maximize the poverty \nreduction impact on local communities through the community development component. Under \nthe component, local residents will be trained for possible employment opportunities. In addition, \nthe planned $2 million JFPR grant project will improve access to local soum centers, and thus \nimprove access of local residents to markets and social services. The planned JFPR project will \nalso help residents improve their income by participating in road maintenance activities. \n \n46.  Road Maintenance. To increase the capacity for road maintenance in the project impact \narea, the proposed ADB grant includes a component to establish three road maintenance units \nwith corresponding equipment. These units are proposed for Bulgan soum, near Baga Ulaan \nPass, and Manhan soum. At least one of the units is expected to be contracted out to the \nprivate sector to manage on a test basis. This will encourage private sector participation in the \ntransport sector in Mongolia. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n47.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n49.  MRTT will be the Executing Agency, responsible for the overall implementation of the \nProject. MRTT will be assisted by a project steering committee and project implementation unit. \nThe steering committee will be set up at the central level within 3 months of grant effectiveness; \nbe chaired by the MRTT state secretary; and comprise representatives of the ministries of \nfinance,  foreign  affaires,  health,  MRTT,  nature  and  environment,  social  welfare  and  labor, \ncustoms general administration of Mongolia and Hovd aimag. It will meet at least once every \n6 months, review implementation progress, and provide guidance, as necessary. ADB may \nattend the meetings as an observer. \n \n50.  A project implementation unit will be established under MRTT to implement activities on \na day-to-day basis. A senior official of the Department of Roads will be appointed as the project \ndirector to head the unit.

The Project will be implemented over 4.5 years, from 2008 to end of the first quarter of \n2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n52.  Road construction will involve three construction packages requiring financing from ADB \nand the Government. In addition, a package funded entirely by the Government comprises \n124 km that have either been recently constructed (64 km), are under construction (40 km), or \nunder  tender  from  the  Government  (20  km)  (Appendixes  10  and  11).  All  ADB-financed \nprocurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe main civil works contracts will be divided into three packages, which will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding and tendered in three batches. ADB and the Government will \nfinance contract package 1, Bodonch Canyon, and package 2, Baga Ulaan Pass\u2013Manhan. \nInvitation of bids, draft bidding documents, and bid evaluation reports are to be submitted to \nADB for prior review and approval. Contract package 3 from Manhan to Hovd aimag center is to \nbe financed by the Government. Equipment financed by ADB will be procured through national \ncompetitive bidding, which will follow the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia (1 December \n2005, as amended) with clarifications and modifications agreed by ADB and the Government. \n \n                                                 \n24 Comprising three highway engineers, an accountant, and an administrative assistant.  \n ", "12 \n4.  Consulting Services \n53.  The Project will finance 92.5 person-months of international consulting services: 16 for \ndetailed design (financed by the Government), 72 for construction supervision, and 4.5 for other \nservices (financed by ADB). Construction supervision will cover all three contract packages. The \ndetailed design period is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2008 and last for the entire \nyear. The full-time construction supervision consulting services will be required from the middle \nof the second quarter of 2009 and continue until civil works construction ends in the first quarter \nof 2012. During the defects liability period, the consultants are not expected to be needed on a \nfull-time basis. The international consultants to be financed by the ADB grant will be selected \nand engaged based on a full technical proposal using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (80% technical and 20% financial weighting) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n54.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  up  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  and  MRTT.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the grant agreement and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payments, and commitment procedures will be \nused for large contracts. If Government funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB\u2019s \nreimbursement procedure will be followed. To facilitate disbursements, MRTT will establish an \nimprest account with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB after grant effectiveness. The \nimprest account ceiling will not exceed the estimated expenditure for the next 6 months or \n$200,000, whichever is lower. To expedite the flow of funds, the statement of expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  or  replenish  eligible  expenditures  for  any \nindividual payment not exceeding $20,000 equivalent.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  An organization chart of the reporting process for the Project is included in Appendix 12. \nThe  companies  contracted  for  road  construction  will  provide  monthly  reports  on  work \nperformance to the supervision consultants and MRTT, who will then provide any findings based \nupon inspection and verification of work performed to ADB. \n \n57.  MRTT will maintain a separate account for the Project and related financial statements \nand will have them audited annually in accordance with auditing standards consistently applied \nby  independent  auditors,  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are \nacceptable to ADB. MRTT will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal \nyear, certified copies of audited project accounts and financial statements, and an auditor\u2019s \nreport on the Project, all in English. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account \n ", "    13 \nand statement of expenditures, will be included as part of the auditor\u2019s report. During project \nimplementation, MRTT will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB as well as a completion \nreport within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n58.  ADB and MRTT will use the project performance management system to demonstrate \nthe effectiveness of project operations, monitor, and be accountable for their performance to \nstakeholders. This will be achieved by monitoring performance targets and indicators included in \nthe design and monitoring framework. The monitoring will use a combined macro and micro \napproach,  the  latter  focusing  on  a  few  key  representative  communities  along  the  project \nalignment. The monitoring process will examine key factors such as traffic volume on the project \nroad, progress of development of the local road network, number of accidents, number of poor \nhouseholds  in  each  community,  and  number  of  jobs  that  can  be  directly  attributed  to \nconstruction of the project road. MRTT will monitor and evaluate the project impacts including \npoverty indicators and community development activities, with the assistance of the consultants, \nto  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are  managed  effectively.  The  project  performance \nmanagement system is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n9.  Project Review \n59.  In addition to regular annual reviews, approximately 20 months after the Project starts, \nMRTT  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  midterm  project  review,  focusing  on  policy,  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, financial, and other \nrelevant  factors  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  project\u2019s  performance  and its  continuing \nviability. The review will examine progress with reform and compliance with assurances in the \ngrant agreement. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n60.  The Project will increase the corridor\u2019s capacity to meet the demand for transport and \nreduce transport costs, travel time, and accident rates. The development of the proposed road \ncorridor  will  provide  employment  opportunities  during  and  after  construction  and  will  be  a \nconduit for increased economic growth and higher incomes. Annual average daily traffic on the \nproposed road between Yarant and Ulaanbaishint is forecast to grow from 826 passenger car \nunits in 2013 to 2,309 in 2022, with an average annual increase of 12%. After 2022, annual \naverage daily traffic growth is expected to slow to 11% per year, reaching 6,480 passenger car \nunits by 2032. The traffic projections consider the (i) growth in traffic during the past 6 years, \n(ii) traffic generated by expanded economic activities, and (iii) traffic surveys (Appendix 14).  \n \n61.  Under the Project, the Yarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd section of the road will be completed. The \npartial completion of the road corridor is expected to affect cross-border traffic and is projected \nto generate 70% of the total estimated traffic flow for the Yarant\u2013Bulgan section and 50% for the \nBulgan\u2013Hovd section. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n62.  Construction  of  the  road  will  provide  a  large  stimulus  to  the  economy  through  the \nestimated $112.22 million project cost. Once the road is in place, the cost of transportation will \nbe  lower,  and  hence,  business  costs  will  be  lower,  providing  an  ongoing  stimulus  to  the \n ", "14 \neconomy. The cost of imported goods will decrease and the net realization from exports mainly \nconnected with animal husbandry will increase, thereby improving terms of trade for Mongolia. \nMoreover,  as  this  area  of  the  country  has  little  industry  and  almost  no  import-competing \nindustry, very few offsetting losses can be anticipated. Like many developing regions, western \nMongolia has relied on local cheap natural resources as the basis for the little industrial activity \nthat exists. Thus, an abundance of land became the source of a livestock industry, which in turn \nled  to  meat  processing,  fiber  production  (cashmere  and  wool),  and  hides  and  skins.  The \nopportunity for future expansion of the number of livestock is limited because overgrazing and \ndesertification already present problems. The new road will improve the situation, as it will \nreduce the large number of parallel dirt tracks (up to 100 on some open stretches of the existing \nalignment), which are highly destructive to surface vegetation. \n \n63.  Economic  viability  mainly  depending  on  projected  traffic  flow  is  more  realistically \nanalyzed for the entire proposed road corridor rather than phase I (the Project) only. The overall \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated by comparing the project case with a base \ncase. The Project, with shorter travel time, safer design, and better road conditions, will reduce \nvehicle operating costs and accident risks along the corridor. The economic costs are the cost \nof capital, which includes physical contingencies, land acquisition, and the cost of operating and \nmaintaining the project roads, including the replacement of depreciated equipment. Economic \nbenefits include (i) savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from the shorter distance and \nimproved road conditions, (ii) time savings for road users, and (iii) trade-related benefits through \ncross-border facilitation. At 16.3% per year, the EIRR demonstrates the economic viability of the \nproposed  road  corridor.  Results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the \neconomic viability. Even with changes in the key variables such as construction costs, reduction \nin traffic volume, and project delay by 1 year, the EIRR is above the cutoff rate of 12%. The \nresults suggest that costs would need to increase by 49.4% to reduce the EIRR to 12%, while \nbenefits would need to be reduced by 33.1% to reduce the EIRR to 12% (Appendix 15). \n \n64.  For phase I (the Project) only, under which only the Yarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd section will be \ncompleted, the EIRR is estimated to be 13.6%, which is still economically viable but lower than \nthe EIRR for the entire proposed road corridor. Although the road is upgraded for the section of \nYarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd by the completion of phase I, the amount of induced international and \nlocal traffic will be affected, compared with the original traffic forecast where the entire road is \ncompleted. This will lead to deferment of achieving economic benefits and, in turn, forces the \nEIRR of phase I to be lower than the EIRR of the entire road corridor. \n \nC.  Cross-Border Transport Facilitation \n65.  ADB and its partners in the CAREC program place a high priority on trade facilitation \nbecause of the potential significant gains from increased trade in the region (footnote 21). One \nof the main benefits from the proposed road corridor is increased cross-border trade among \nMongolia, PRC, and the Russian Federation, which will contribute to regional cooperation and \nintegration under CAREC. CAREC has confirmed the designation of the AH4 route as its priority \ntransport corridor, and the route will receive priority for CAREC trade facilitation support. As \nagreed  at  CAREC\u2019s  6th  Transport  Sector  Coordination  Committee  Meeting,  Mongolia  will \nimplement harmonized cross-border procedures at its border crossings. This will significantly \nimprove the movement of vehicles across the border. ADB is currently studying the details of \ncross-border trade between Mongolia and the PRC under a regional TA.25 The TA outputs will \nhelp improve cross-border trade between Mongolia and the PRC. Mongolia has already signed \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China and Mongolia for the Development of Regional \nCooperation Program. Manila. \n ", "    15 \nbilateral cross-border agreements with the PRC and the Russian Federation, and is expected to \nsign a tripartite agreement as well.  \n \n66.  Trade figures of the western Mongolia's two neighboring provinces of the PRC and the \nRussian Federation are sizable. In 2005, for all transport methods, the Russian Federation as a \nwhole exported $418 million to Mongolia and $12.9 billion to the PRC ($1.7 billion of which went \nto Xinjiang). In focusing on just the east-central Siberian region, its total exports amounted to \n$21.1 billion and imports to around $3 billion. Of these, $38 million were exported to Mongolia, \nwhile $65 million were exported to the PRC. In looking at goods flowing the other way, east-\ncentral Siberia imported $5 million from Mongolia and $73 million from the PRC. In the east-\ncentral Siberian region, the main industries are dedicated to metals and minerals, synthetic \nrubber, petrochemicals, iron and steel, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, all of which can be \nexported by road to the PRC via Mongolia. Food processing and forest-based industries are \nalso present, but to a lesser degree. Western Mongolia also imports almost all of its energy \nsupplies from Siberia and needs to expand its energy supplies to sustain its growth. The project \nroad will facilitate easier and more reliable supply of such needs. \n \n67.  Xinjiang has more than $5 billion of exports and just under $3 billion of imports. Xinjiang \nexports to the Russian Federation amount to $593 million. The PRC\u2019s exports to the Russian \nFederation include agricultural products, manufactured goods such as consumer durables, and \ngarments/textiles. These numbers suggest a sizable potential in terms of western Mongolia\u2019s \nexternal trade as well as transit trade between Xinjiang and east-central Siberia. Currently, \nexports  from  the  Russian  Federation  to  Xinjiang  via  road  transport  enter  mainly  through \nKazakhstan. \n \n68.  Also of importance for this analysis is the fact that three cities in east-central Siberia, \nNovosibirsk,  Barnaul,  and  Biysk,  are  important  transport  and  distribution  centers  with \nNovosibirsk being a hub for rail, air, and road transport; while Barnaul is an important rail and \nroad center with connections to the western part of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. \nBiysk is a significant transshipment point for rail transport. Goods that flow to these locations \nfrom other parts of the Russian Federation could be loaded into trucks for further transport to \nMongolia or to the PRC via Mongolia. Likewise, goods arriving in Urumqi can be transported \neast by using the PRC\u2019s road and rail network. Currently, for transit traffic to and from the \nRussian Federation and the PRC, the options could involve travel through Kazakhstan or central \nMongolia. However, transit through Kazakhstan can be cumbersome and costly due to the \nlonger distance involved. \n \n69.  An improved paved road that provides easy access to both Urumqi and Novosibirsk \nwould reduce travel time and vehicle operating costs. Some traffic that has been using the \nKazakhstan route could be diverted to the project road. \n \nD.  Financial Analysis \n70.  The Project is expected to cost $112.22 million, with ADB providing $37.6 million, and \nthe Government providing $74.62 million. Using these funds, the project road will be constructed \nfrom the south to the north, with ADB financing being used for the following sections: Bodonch \nCanyon and Baga Ulaan Pass to Manhan soum. \n \n71.  To maintain the road so that it does not exceed an international roughness index of 4.5, \nannual  maintenance  will  be  required  along  with  periodic  maintenance  every  8  years  and \nrehabilitation every 16 years. For the entire project road, the annual cost of maintenance is \n ", "16 \nanticipated to be $0.67 million, with $9.31 million for periodic maintenance and $25.0 million for \nrehabilitation (Appendix 16). \n \n72.  To offset costs associated with maintenance and ensure sustainability, a road-user fee is \nproposed at the PRC  border.26 It will be levied on all vehicles that have not paid any of \nMongolia\u2019s  current  road-user  fees.  The  fee  will  be  fixed  after  considering  factors  such  as \naffordability and type of vehicle. Given the projected traffic volume and estimated user fees of \n$5 for light trucks, $7.50 for medium trucks, and $10 for heavy trucks, the annual amount \ncollected  at  the  border  is  estimated  to  be  higher  than  the  need  for  annual  and  periodic \nmaintenance and will cover a major part of the rehabilitation cost as well. A discounted road-\nuser fee may be charged on Mongolian vehicles. Fees payable will be set on an affordability \nbasis and be reviewed periodically. \n \nE.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n73.  Stakeholder  Consultations. More than 6,200 people were consulted during project \npreparation through household surveys, origin-to-destination surveys, public meetings, business \nsurveys, and the environmental impact assessment (EIA). Discussions involved all aspects of \nthe project road, including benefits and other potential impacts. The consensus is that the \nproject  road  will  positively  impact  the  region  by  reducing  dust  generation,  decreasing \ngeographic isolation, and increasing access to goods and markets. \n \n74.  Social Benefits. The construction and upgrading of the project road will result in the \ncreation of a considerable number of jobs for communities located along the alignment. The \nProject is the key to development in Mongolia\u2019s western region and without the Project, no \ndevelopment activities stated in the Western Region Development Plan will be accomplished as \nno infrastructure facilities are in place for commercial development. The newly created jobs will \nallow households to bring extra income and be trained in road construction and/or maintenance, \nwhich can be applied to future opportunities. Assuming that the contractor will hire 80% of the \nunskilled labor from poor households in the project impact area, 1,040 jobs for the poor will be \ncreated.  Approximately,  200  of  these  unskilled  workers  who  gain  experience  in  road \nconstruction can be absorbed into the road maintenance centers. Further opportunities will arise \nfrom travelers on the road spending money in the soums. The overall result of the road on the \npoor in the project impact area is the elevation of 19.1% of poor households from poverty status \n(Appendix 17). \n \n75.  Control and Mitigation of Epidemic Diseases. As with any road construction project, a \ndanger is the spread of disease as a result of bringing a mobile population of construction \nworkers  and/or  mobile  professionals  into  the  alignment  communities.  At  the  same  time, \ncommunicable diseases in the local communities could be spread to other areas as workers and \nprofessionals return home. HIV/AIDS is a primary concern, however, its incidence in Mongolia is \nlow. To mitigate against this and other diseases, construction contracts should require (i) only \nlegal  workers  are  employed,  (ii)  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  information  is  provided  to  workers, \n(iii) condoms are made available to workers, (iv) HIV/AIDS and STI testing is provided, and \n(v) HIV/AIDS and STI monitoring will be allowed. \n \n76.  As  part  of  earlier  ADB-funded  TA  in  Mongolia  connected  to  the  Regional  Road \nDevelopment  Project  (footnote  19),  materials  have  been  developed  for  HIV/AIDS  and  STI \neducation  indicating  their  associated  dangers,  along  with  human  trafficking.  Utilizing  these \nmaterials, the TA benefits can be transferred to the Project at very little cost. All construction \n                                                 \n26 A road user fee at the Russian border will be enforced after completion of phase II of the proposed route. \n ", "    17 \nworkers  should  be  educated  on  these  topics  and  provided  with  the  previously  developed \nmaterials.  \n \n77.  Ethnic Minorities. In Hovd aimag, the population of the project area is almost entirely \nMongolian; in Bayan-Olgiy, the population is primarily Kazakh minority. The project road will not \nhave a negative impact or make significant changes to their livelihoods or culture. To extend \npositive  impacts  to  local  communities,  the  Project  allocates  $150,000  for  community \ndevelopment activities, and the proposed JFPR project will develop community-based local road \nupgrading and maintenance. \n \n78.  Gender  Impacts.  The  road  upgrading  could  play  an  important  role  in  generating \neconomic growth in the region, thereby increasing opportunities for women and men to generate \nincome  for  their  families  and  achieve  financial  security.  This  increased  revenue  for  local \ngovernments means that kindergartens and other facilities are more likely to be built to enable \nfemale heads of households to work, support their families better, and ensure that their children \nget an education. MRTT will ensure that all the employment opportunities will be given and \nMongolian labor standards are applied to everyone regardless of gender. \n \nF.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n79.  The proposed project road follows an existing earth track alignment. No households will \nlose land; houses; agricultural plots; crops; trees; fixed assets; business; incomes or livelihoods; \nor access to facilities, services, or natural resources. \n \nG.  Environmental Assessment and Management Plan \n80.  The Project is environment category A. The EIA was prepared and a summary EIA for \nthe  Project  was  circulated  to  the  Board  on  17  August  2007.  The  EIA  assesses  the \nenvironmental impact of selected alignments of the project road and prescribes environmental \nprotection and mitigation measures, valued at $1.47 million. Discussions with the World Wide \nFund for Nature, Wildlife Conservation Society, and Specially Protected Area Administration \nDepartment in Ulaanbaatar indicate that the project road will have little impact on existing \nwildlife and their migratory patterns, primarily because the road corridor is an existing alignment \nthat has been used for many years. Project implementation is expected to positively impact the \nenvironment by reducing dust, decreasing soil degradation, eliminating multiple earth tracks \ncurrently being utilized, and contributing to economic development of the region. To minimize \nthe impact of the Project on environmental aspects, the Ministry of Nature and Environment will \nsupervise and monitor the environmental aspects. Capacity of the ministry will be strengthened \nby providing 36 person-months of national consulting. \n \nH.  Risks and Assumptions \n81.  The  Government  has  given  assurance  that  phase  II  of  the  project  road  will  be \nimplemented in 2010. Failure to do so may result in reduction of the anticipated economic \nbenefits of the Project. \n \n82.  The project design considers potential technical, economic, financial, and social risks. \nThe main technical risks are associated with road construction in the Bodonch Canyon area and \nweather-related conditions. To minimize the technical risks, (i) the proposed alignment through \nBodonch Canyon has been rerouted to reduce the earthworks and blasting needed; (ii) slope \nprotection measures, retention walls, and permafrost protection are proposed; (iii) road safety \n ", "18 \nequipment will be installed; and (iv) additional bridges will be constructed to facilitate river \ncrossings. With regard to weather, the design incorporates standards of the Mongolian-issued \nRoad Climatic Zones and Geotechnical Conditions. \n \n83.  The social risks primarily involve HIV/AIDS and STI transmission. To mitigate against \nthese risks, construction contracts will contain clauses providing means for providing HIV/AIDS \ninformation and testing, and stating that workers who violate the rules and regulations will be \nimmediately  terminated  and  subject  to  prosecution  if  laws  have  been  broken.  Appropriate \nmitigation measures to counter these risks are in place in the social development action plan \nand the environmental management plan. MRTT demonstrated a high degree of ownership in \npreparing and committing to implementation of these action plans. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n84.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n85.  Counterpart  Financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  funds  and  resources \nnecessary for construction, operation and maintenance, and management of the Project are \nprovided in a timely manner. The Government will take all necessary measures, including the \nprovision of additional funds to ensure that the Project is successfully implemented, managed \nand operated after construction is completed. \n \n86.  Development  of  Phase  II.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  funds  are \nallocated to phase II of the proposed road corridor and implementation of phase II is started not \nlater than 31 December 2010.  \n \n87.  Construction Quality. The Government, through MRTT, will ensure that (i) the project \nroad is constructed in accordance with national technical standards; (ii) project construction \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  conducted  in  accordance  with \nnational  standards  and  internationally  accepted  practices;  (iii)  ongoing  civil  works  under \ngovernment financing are executed in accordance with national technical standards; and (iv) the \ncompleted sections of the project road are adequately maintained. \n \n88.  Environment.  The  Government,  through  MRTT,  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is \ndesigned, constructed, and operated in accordance with environmental laws and regulations of \nthe Government and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), the EIA, and summary EIA; (ii) the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  the  mitigation  measures  included  therein,  as \nspecified in the EIA and summary EIA, are properly implemented; (iii) the EMP is updated at the \nengineering design stage, and incorporated into bidding documents and civil works contracts; \n(iv) any adverse impact on the environment that may arise from project implementation activities \nis promptly mitigated or minimized in accordance with the EMP; and (v) implementation of the \nEMP,  including  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of  environmental  standards,  and  corrective \nmeasures taken thereto, is reported at least semiannually to ADB. \n \n89.  Community Development. The Government, through MRTT, will manage and monitor \ncommunity development activities proposed under the Project by the project implementation unit \nand agreed by ADB. \n \n90.  Local  Employment. The Government, through MRTT, will cause the contractors to \nemploy unskilled workers from local areas to maximize the employment of local poor people, \n ", "    19 \nincluding ethnic minorities, who meet the job and efficiency requirements for construction and \nmaintenance of the project road. The Government, through MRTT, will ensure that such workers \nare provided with adequate on-the-job training. \n \n91.  Labor Standards. The Government, through MRTT, will ensure that all the employment \nand labor standards provided in the applicable laws and regulations of Mongolia are complied \nwith, and in particular, that all civil works contractors engaged under the Project will (i) provide \ntimely payment of wages on at least a monthly basis; (ii) provide safe working conditions to all \nworkers, with such requirements being included in the civil works contracts and monitored by \nthe construction supervision consultants; (iii) provide employment opportunities to women and \nethnic minorities, where appropriate, and pay equal wages to male and female employees for \nwork of equal value; and (iv) do not employ child labor in the project works. \n \n92.  Health Risks. The Government, through MRTT, in coordination with the appropriate \nagencies identified by the Government, will cause the contractors to disseminate information on \nthe risks of STI, including HIV/AIDS, to their employees during project implementation. MRTT \nwill cause the appropriate agencies to disseminate similar information to transport operators and \nlocal communities living in the project area during project implementation and operation of the \nproject road. The Government, through MRTT will cause contractors to monitor health risk \ncontrol. \n \n93.  Commercial Development in the Project Area. To ensure that the expected benefits \nof  the  Project  are  channeled  through  to  the  local  community,  the  Government  will  start \nimplementing the Western Region Development Plan approved by the cabinet on 28 September \n2005 for soums and aimag centers along the project road within 2 years after completion of \nconstruction of the project road. \n \n94.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  Government,  through  MRTT,  will  monitor  and \nevaluates  the  project  impacts  including  poverty  indicators  and  community  development \nactivities,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  to  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are \nmanaged effectively and the benefits, particularly to the poor, are maximized. The Government \nwill cause MRTT to (i) employ a qualified domestic institute, prior to project implementation, to \ncarry out the monitoring activities; (ii) ensure that local governments, including local statistics \noffices,  collect  the  data  to  measure  the  relevant  indicators  prior  to  and  during  project \nimplementation, at completion, and annually 3 years thereafter, with the frequency as specified; \nand (iii) submit to ADB the reports summarizing the key findings of monitoring. \n \n95.  Resettlement. The Government will ensure that the Project does not entail any land \nacquisition and/or resettlement. In the event of any unforeseen resettlement, (i) the Government \nwill inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and regulations, and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); and (ii) civil works will not start until ADB has \nreviewed and approved the resettlement plan. \n \n96.  Ethnic Minorities. The Government will ensure that the Project does not have any \nadverse impact on the livelihood of nomadic herders and ethnic minorities living in the project \narea. In the event of any unforeseen impact on the livelihood of nomadic herders and ethnic \nminorities, (i) the Government will inform ADB and prepare a plan according to relevant laws \nand regulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998); and (ii) civil works will not \nstart until ADB has reviewed and approved the plan. \n \n ", "20 \n97.  Anticorruption Measures. The Government, through MRTT, will ensure that ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy and the Government\u2019s anticorruption policy will be followed. MRTT will also \nensure, in accordance with the Government\u2019s regulations and requirements, during project \nimplementation  that  (i)  appropriate  officials  are  resident  in  the  project  offices  for  bidding, \nconstruction, and operations; (ii) an internal audit unit is established within MRTT; (iii) a two-\ncontract  system  is  adopted  where  the  winner  of  a  civil  works  contract  must  also  sign  an \nanticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  and  (iv)  periodic  inspection  of  contractors  is \nundertaken to ensure that fund withdrawal and settlement procedures are followed. MRTT will \ninitiate  liaison  meetings,  if  needed,  to  discuss  warnings  about  or  information  on  corrupt \npractices. \n \n98.  Control of Axle Weight of Vehicles. Before opening of the project road to the public, \nthe Government will introduce necessary regulation and take necessary measures to control \naxle weight of vehicles on the project road to a maximum weight of 10 tons per axle, and to \nprevent overloaded vehicles entering the project road after its completion. \n \n99.  Road User Fees and Maintenance. The Government will ensure that all collected road-\nuser fees are directly used for the maintenance and rehabilitation of the project road and the \nproject road is well maintained after its completion. In the event that road-user fees collected are \ninsufficient for the maintenance and rehabilitation of the project road, the Government will \nundertake maintenance work by allocating adequate funds from the Government budget. \n \n100.  Cross-Border  Trade. The Government will take necessary measures to implement \nharmonized cross-border procedures at Yarant by 31 December 2012 and ensure that the \nborder crossing will be open to the public all year around without restricting the border crossing \nto residents and citixens of Mongolia and the PRC.  \n \n101.  Capacity Building. The Government will ensure that a policy and planning division is \nestablished in MRTT within 2 years after grant effectiveness. The Government, through MRTT, \nwill manage and monitor capacity building activities proposed under the Project and agreed by \nADB. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n102.

Current  Status.  Mongolia\u2019s  road  network,  including  state  and  local  roads,  totals \napproximately 49,250 kilometers (km) connecting 21 major cities and towns and 160 smaller \nvillages (soums [local administrative division] and bags [rural administrative subdivision]). Of this \ntotal, state roads account for 11,219 km. The remaining 38,031 km are aimag [province] and \nlocal roads, classified as earthen tracks. Asphalt roads account for 2,278 km (4.6%), gravel \nroads 1,980 km (4.0%), and improved earth roads approximately 1,868 km (3.8%) of the total \nlength of the road network. \n \n2.  Despite the impressive growth rate in vehicle ownership in recent years, Mongolia\u2019s road \ninfrastructure lags far what is needed. In terms of road density and percent of paved roads, \nMongolia is close to the lower end of the countries worldwide (Figure A2). In terms of vehicle \nownership,  Mongolia  is  very  close  to  the  midvalue  of  vehicles/1,000-people.  To  support \ndemand, Mongolia must improve its road density and paved roads to reach international norms \nindicative of the relative development of its road subsector. \n \nFigure A2: Mongolian Road Subsector in Perspective \n         Range in the World\nMid-Value\n0.01 0.03 0.18 0.2 4.9\nRoad Density(km/sq.km)\nMongolia PRC\n2.5   3.5 45.5 78.7 100\n% Paved Roads\nMongolia PRC\nNo of 4+ wheel  0.2 26.2 42.4 45.8 933.1\nVehicles/1000 people\nPRC Mongolia\n \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Prepared by TERA International Group, Inc., from published national statistics in the PRC and \nMongolia.

Road  Subsector  Strategy.  The  initial  national  transport  strategy  for  Mongolia  was \nprepared in 1999 with World Bank assistance. The Government revised its national transport \nstrategy in 2006 with ADB assistance. The updated national transport strategy aims to provide ", "24  Appendix 2 \nsafe, dependable, effective, efficient, and fully integrated transport operations and infrastructure \nto support the social and economic development of the nation by meeting the needs of freight \nshippers and passengers. This will be achieved by improving service and minimizing costs in a \nmanner  that  supports  Government  objectives  for  economic  and  social  development.  All \nimprovement measures will be environmentally and economically sustainable. In addition, the \nnational  transport  strategy  proposes  to  improve  transport  system  efficiency  by  enhancing \nregional transport arrangements. The strategies for roads include (i) providing all-weather road \nconnections to aimag capitals and major points to neighboring countries, (ii) improving the \nprimary network by rehabilitating and maintaining the primary road network, (iii) planning and \nprioritizing large investments required to rehabilitate the road network, (iv) reviewing road user \ncharges and establishing a new and efficient system, (v) promoting private sector participation, \nand (vi) increasing road user representation by participating in the Road Management Board. \nThe national strategy supports development of the Project, and the Millennium Development \nGoals include the proposed road corridor as one of the key development projects for Mongolia. \n4.  Road Subsector Funding. The road subsector is financed by road funds and the state \nbudget. Although the creation of road funds was a significant and important step, their structure \nhas created inequity in the system. At present, three types of road funds are in place: State \nRoad Fund, 21 local (aimag or provincial) road funds, and an Urban Road Fund. Only the State \nRoad Fund receives an allocation from the fuel taxes, the other two depend entirely on vehicle \nlicensing taxes, other municipal taxes, and an allocation from aimag or municipal governments. \nFurthermore, fund expenditures are not restricted to road maintenance, which is the evident \nneed. Expenditure on maintenance makes up only about 25% of allocations, the rest is spent on \nnew construction and, in the case of the State Road Fund, counterpart financing for international \nfinancing institution-funded projects. \n5.  In recent years, road fund revenues have improved but still are not sufficient to meet \nrequests of the Department of Roads. In 2005, MNT22,180 million was allocated to the funds. \nAccording to the Department of Roads, this was 82% of what was actually requested. As shown \nin Table A2.1, from 2002 to 2005 funding for roads ranged from 63% to 87% of the amount \nrequested by the Department of Roads. \n6.  Freight  Transportation.  The  road  portion  of  total  freight  volume  and  turnover  has \ngenerally increased as a percentage since 2001 (Table A2.2). The dramatic leap in road freight \nvolume and turnover in 2003 appears to reflect an adjustment by the National Statistical Office \nin the volume of road traffic. By 2005, the road subsector accounted for 38.2% of freight shipped \nand 3.0% of freight turnover. \n \n7.  Passenger Transportation. At the national level, road transport accounted for 97.7% of \npassengers carried and about 23.7% of passenger turnover in 2005 (Table A2.3). The high \npercentage for passengers carried is due to the inclusion of commuter traffic in Ulaanbaatar and \nother cities. This traffic has low trip distances, which explains the low passenger turnover share \nin relation to the share of passengers carried. \n \n8.  Road Transport Demand. Table A2.4 summarizes the actual transport sector demand \nfor 2005 and projected demand for 2015 by road, rail, air, and inland waterways. The estimates \nfor  roads  include  urban  transport,  which  currently  represents  the  bulk  of  road  freight  and \npassenger  transport  demand.  From  2005  to  2015,  road  transport  demand  is  expected  to \nincrease by 6.5 times in terms of tons and 9.6 times in terms of ton-km. The corresponding \ngrowth for passengers is 2.1 and passenger-km 4.2.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nTable A2.1: Funding Requested and Received by the Department of Roads  \n(MNT million) \n \n Item  2002  2003  2004  2005 \n         \nA.

The project road will be designed according to Mongolian category III standards, in \naccordance with Mongolia\u2019s Road Design Standard CNR 21-01-00. This category of road is \nmade up of two-lane, undivided roads with an average volume of traffic, and a design speed of \n100 kilometers (km) per hour (h), 80 km/h, or 60 km/h, depending on the terrain.1 The cross \nsection involves lanes of 3.5 meters (m) width and 1.5 m shoulders on each side. The proposed \ncross section and road design standards are consistent with standards for class II highways of \nthe Asian Highway Network. \n2.  The road is proposed to have a design life horizon of 2013\u20132032, with traffic volume \nexpected  to  reach  4,841\u20135,573  vehicles  per  day  by  2032.  Given  these  projections,  \n5-centimeter  (cm)  asphalt  concrete  surface  course  pavement  is  recommended,  with  the \nfollowing pavement design. \n3.  Existing  Road  Segments.  Inventory  and  condition  surveys  were  carried  out  for \n21 existing road subsections ranging in length from 12.4 km to 73.2 km. Two of the inventoried \nstretches (from Yarant to Uyench and near Hovd) are paved with asphalt; one section is gravel \nroad.  With  the  imprint  of  maintenance  activities  such  as  culvert  renovation,  raising  of \nembankment and grading can be seen. In many stretches, side drains are blocked or eroded. \n4.  The remaining road sections are categorized as earth or improved earth road. Some of \nmay have had selected earth covers earlier, which have not been replenished and graded. In \nterms of their present condition, they are to be treated as earth roads only. The earth road \nsegments have poor capacity for transport traffic and are liable to be bypassed through the use \nof  parallel  unformed  tracks  (except  in  approaches  to  passes  and  bridges,  where  traffic  is \nconstrained  to  use  the  existing  earth  roads).  The  sections  with  improved  road,  with  the \nexception of the Bodonch Canyon area, do not have drainage ditches. \n5.  Of the 431.2 km road length, currently, 83.8 km is asphalt (including the 64 km from the \nborder with the People\u2019s Republic of China to Uyench River), 12.4 km is gravel, 121.5 km is \nimproved road, and the remaining 213.5 km is earth road. \n6.  Alternative Alignments. In the preliminary road design, alternative alignments were \nproposed and considered throughout the corridor. The first is located between Bodonch and \nManhan. The selected alignment includes two mountain passes and was found to be a cheaper \nand shorter alternative than the longer and flatter option to the east. The second alternative \nalignment is located in Hovd city, where the options include constructing the road through the \ncity or bypassing it. The bypass option was selected, meaning the road will pass Hovd city to \nthe east, as this option eliminates land acquisition issues, utilizes a 19 km section of existing \nasphalt pavement, and keep trucks out of the city center. \n7.  Bridges and Culverts. Along the 431.2 km alignment, construction of 32 new bridges \nand rehabilitation or reconstruction of 12 existing bridges is proposed. Of these, 27 new bridges \nwill be constructed in the Bodonch Canyon section. In this same section, all 8 existing bridges \nwill be rehabilitated or reconstructed. Due to the narrow canyon, the presence of Bodonch \nRiver,  and  the  limited  sight  distances  in  this  section,  the  alignment  has  been  altered  to \nincorporate new bridges, thereby increasing safety. Additionally, this new alignment will reduce \nthe amount of earthworks and blasting needed to construct the road. \n                                                 \n1  In flat areas, the design speed is 100 km/h; in rolling areas 80 km/h, and in mountainous areas 60 km/h. \n ", "  Appendix 4  29 \n8.  Currently, 81 culverts are located along the project road, including 57 in the package to \nbe  funded  solely  by  the  Government.  Of  this  total  number,  22  culverts  will  need  to  be \nreconstructed and an additional 35 new culverts installed. Following the reconstruction and \ninstallation of these culverts, the total number along the alignment will increase to 116. \n9.  Impact of Weather and Construction Season. The project road from Yarant to Hovd is \nlocated in an area of diverse climatic conditions. Roads in this region can be covered with sand \nand snowdrifts due to strong winds, soil erosion can occur due to rain and snow, and vast \nvariations of cold and hot weather all affect the road and its surroundings. Hence construction \nworks can only be carried out during a limited seasonal window. Construction is generally only \npossible 5\u20136 months of the year. Throughout the alignment, asphalt pavement work is limited to \nMay\u2013September, while earthwork is limited to May\u2013October. \n10.  Hot versus Cold Asphalt. In considering the surface for the project road and the limited \nperiod throughout the year for construction, the potential for using cold asphalt was considered. \nAfter  reviewing  the  two  options,  hot  asphalt  was  selected.  This  method  results  in  greater \nstrength and less maintenance over time, thereby reducing overall maintenance costs. The use \nof cold asphalt would lengthen the construction season, but its disadvantages outweigh the \nbenefits derived from extending the construction season. \n11.  Road Maintenance. To ensure that the road surface is sustained at an international \nroughness index value not to exceed 4.5, maintenance procedures must be implemented. In \naddition to routine maintenance ($1,562 per km), periodic maintenance will be required every \n8 years at $24,900 per km and rehabilitation every 16 years at $69,420 per km. For routine \nmaintenance along the entire road, $0.67 million is needed per year, while periodic maintenance \nwill require $9.31 million every 8 years and rehabilitation $25.0 million every 16 years. The \nfinancial analysis appendix discusses proposed payment measures (Appendix 16). \n12.  Current road maintenance management and equipment capability within the project area \nis in the early stage of development due to the area\u2019s remoteness and low road network \nintensity. The one maintenance center is located in Hovd, which is traversed by the project road \nand is responsible for road maintenance. Equipment for the road maintenance center was \nprocured primarily from the Russian Federation and has been in use for approximately 20 years. \n13.  To increase the capacity for road maintenance in the project impact area, the proposed \nADB grant includes a component for establishing three maintenance centers with equipment in \nBulgan soum, near Baga Ulaan Pass, and Manhan soum. Two are expected to be government \nowned, and the third privately owned. \n14.  Rest  Areas.  According  to  Mongolian  Design  Standard  32-01-00,  rest  areas  are \nmandatory on all arterial roads and should include some or all of the following amenities: \nparking areas for cars, trucks, and other vehicles; potable water supply; toilets; picnic shelters, \ntables, and benches; public telephones; information facilities; lighting; and other amenities. Rest \nareas should be spaced at intervals of 50\u201380 km. While these rest areas will be sited and \ndetails developed during the detailed design phase of the project road, six rest areas are \nproposed along the alignment. This number includes the welcome center at the border with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \n ", "30  Appendix 5 \nROAD MAINTENANCE CENTERS \n \n1.  The highest priority for roads over the past few years has been maintaining the road \nsystem. This is still far from complete but is receiving attention by international organizations. \nLarge economic losses in terms of increased vehicle operating costs and reduced economic \nproduction and development will result if the existing road infrastructure is allowed to continue to \ndeteriorate.  The  maintenance  of  the  state  roads  is  a  priority  because  they  are  essential \neconomic growth corridors both for domestic and international trade (including serving as part of \nthe trans-Asia network and providing direct access to international gateways), while providing \nmechanisms for achieving the Government\u2019s regional development objectives via improved \nintegration and communication within Mongolia. \n \n2.  In addition to the economic factors, proper road maintenance is key to securing road \ntransportation  services  in  the  project  area  due  to  the  natural  characteristics  of  western \nMongolia. The proposed project road is situated in the high mountainous area of the western \nregion. Roads can be covered with sand and snowdrifts due to strong winds; soil erosion at road \nembankments can occur due to rain and snow; rockfalls can endanger road users traveling at \nmiddle/high speed near steep and rocky hills; vast variations of cold and hot weather affect road \nusers, road infrastructure, and surroundings; and the steep gradient causes surface water to \nflow rapidly carrying small stones that block drainage. The influence of storms during the spring \nand fall is greater than in other regions of the country and slush can often occur, causing \nvehicles to slide. Additionally, due to summer rainfall, periodic floods can be expected.  \n \n3.  Current road maintenance capability in the project area is inadequate to cover increasing \nrequirements for road servicing because or the relative isolation and low road network density. \nTo remedy this, road maintenance centers will be established along the proposed project road \napproximately every 100 kilometers: in Bulgan Soum, Baga Ulaan Pass, and Manhan Soum. \nThe international roughness index of the road will not exceed a value of 4.5 at any given time, \nthereby ensuring that benefits resulting from decreased vehicle operating cost and fuel savings \nwill continue. \n \n4.  Major responsibilities of the maintenance centers include the following: \n \n(i)  Maintain pavement, base course, and subbase course; prevent sliding pavement, \nprovide surface dressing, repair cracks, and provide overlay and rehabilitation. \n \n(ii)  Patrol, remove snow, spread sand on icy roads, and support stuck vehicles \nduring winter with special attention to pass areas such as Baga Ulaan Pass. \n \n(iii)  Inspect drainage facilities, and provide necessary maintenance work if these are \nblocked or damaged. \n \n(iv)  Clear rockfalls and check/repair the road infrastructure such as slope protection, \nretaining walls, and revetment structures at least twice a month or more in pass \nareas with steep slopes, such as Bodonch Canyon. \n \n(v)  Check  culverts  with  hillside  ditches  and  provide  repair  work  especially  at \nBodonch Canyon; flash floods can cause soil erosion, and water-coved roads \nand floods can occur during spring and summer. \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  31 \nEQUIPMENT FOR THE PROJECT \n \n1.  Three  sets  of  light  equipment  for  road  maintenance  will  be  procured  for  the  road \nmaintenance centers at a total estimated cost of $250,000 (Table A6.1). \n \nTable A6.1: Equipment for Maintenance Centers  \n \nNo.  Equipment  Unit Price ($)  Quantity  Total ($) \n1  Small grader (small land leveler grader)  10,000  1  10,000 \nSmall tractor for moving required \n2  15,000  1  15,000 \nequipment (capacity: 80 horsepower) \n3  Hand bitumen spreader (with heater)  4,000  1  4,000 \n4  Hand asphalt cutter  2,000  2  4,000 \n5  Hand compactor  1,050  2  2,100 \n6  Moving water tank  4,000  1  4,000 \n7  Mini track, 3 tons  5,000  2  10,000 \n8  Pickup for workers  6,000  1  6,000 \n9  Moving compressor  1,500  1  1,500 \n10  Mini loader (excavator)  20,000  1  20,000 \n    Subtotal      76,600 \n11  Office for workers (approx. 70 m2)  6,400  1  6,400 \n  Subtotal (for one maintenance unit)    83,000 \n    Total (for 3 units)    250,000 \nm2 = square meter. \nSource: Ministry of Road Transport and Tourism. \n \n2.  To reinforce the overloading regulation, two weigh scales will be procured at a cost of \n$35,000 each, for positioning near Mongolia\u2019s border crossings with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and Hovd. \n \n3.  The project highway will increase access to the project area, where endangered animals \nsuch as Saiga (an antelope) exist. However, current capacity of local government rangers to \ndeal  with  poachers  is  insufficient  if  access  to  the  region  increases.  The  environmental \nmonitoring  consultants  through  consultation  with  local  government  officials  will  provide  a \ndetailed list of equipment needed for ecological monitoring and submit it to ADB through MRTT \nduring project implementation (Table A6.2). \n \nTable A6.2: Equipment for Ecological Monitoring \n \nNo.  Name of Equipment  Unit Price ($)  Quantity  Total ($) \n1  Patrol vehicle  5,000  4  60,000 \n2  Road kill prevention equipment  10,000  1  10,000 \n3  Field monitoring equipment  2,500  4  10,000 \n    Total      80,000 \nSource: Ministry of Road Transport and Tourism. \n \n4.

Mongolia has a serious road traffic safety problem; traffic accidents have a significant \neconomic cost, as well as social and personal impacts on victims and their families. The number \nof accidents increased nearly 7 times between 1995 and 2006, from 860 to 5,911. Fatalities \nfrom road accidents in urban areas increased by 28.6%; injuries increased by approximately \n46.2%.  In  rural  areas,  accidents  increased  by  27.7%,  while  deaths  remained  relatively \nunchanged and injuries increased by 34.2%. Rural areas accounted for approximately one fifth \nof total accidents and two thirds of deaths nationally. In this respect, rural areas are a more \nsignificant source of road accident fatalities. \n \n2.  The analysis of national data on accidents and vehicle ownership shows that while the \nnumber of accidents per 1,000 vehicles increased more than 27.7% in the 12-year period, \ndeaths per 1,000 vehicles decreased by 9.3% and injuries by 7.1%. In terms of severity, \nnational statistics show the following trend: deaths resulting from accidents between 1995 and \n2006 remained relatively unchanged (0.34 and 0.33); injuries decreased from 1.01 to 0.25. \n \n3.  The  Road  Law  and  Road  Transport  Law  detail  the  duties  and  functions  of  each \nadministrative level to ensure that roads are properly maintained and the traffic flow is well-\nmanaged and safe for the general public. \n \n4.  Road Safety Issues. With the exception of the southernmost 64 kilometers at the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2013Mongolia border and short sections passing through Hovd and \nOlgiy and at the Russian Federation border, the project road is not paved, making vehicle travel \ndifficult, particularly for large trucks crossing the mountain passes. Road safety is a concern in \nhilly and mountainous areas as vehicles try to maneuver around bends where sight lines may \nbe limited. \n \n5.  In populated areas, speeding vehicles and the presence of pedestrians and livestock \nunwary  of  oncoming  traffic  pose  a  safety  threat.  With  the  proposed  road  upgrading  and \nimprovement, both traffic volume and speed will increase, correspondingly heightening the risk \nof road accidents.  \n \n6.  The road segment from Bulgan soum [local administrative division] to the junction for \nMust soum is approximately 170 kilometers and covers a wide range of topography. It includes \na river crossing of Uyench River, currently without a bridge; a river valley along Bodonch River \nwith nine bridges crossing the river; and a 2,860-meter mountain pass. The alignment of the \nsection  has  numerous  very  sharp  horizontal  curves  with  limited  sight  distances  in  narrow \nsections. This road segment will require alignment modifications to provide a wider carriageway \nand better horizontal radii and sight distances. \n \n7.  Due to hilly and mountainous terrain, rockfalls may occur in some areas. These are \npotentially hazardous to vehicles that try to avoid them. In certain areas, structural measures \nmay be necessary such as riprap revetments, rock cladding, or retaining walls.  \n \n8.  Safety railings or post barriers are generally absent in the winding segments of the \nproject road. At a minimum, adequate additional width or wider sections at road bends is \nneeded to accommodate turning vehicles. \n \n9.  Road Safety Improvement Proposed under the Project. To improve road safety along \nthe project road, several road safety measures should be considered and included in the \n ", "  Appendix 7  33 \ndetailed engineering design phase and in safety plans during construction and after placing the \nroad in service. These measures should be considered necessary components of the Project.  \n \n10.  Road Safety Audit. Road safety audits are needed at the detailed design stage and \npreopening stages. A road safety audit is a formal examination of an existing or future road; the \nmain objective is to ensure a high degree of safety for all new highway schemes before projects \nare implemented and before any accidents happen. A qualified team reports on the accident \npotential and safety performance.  \n \n11.  Road  Signage  and  Markings.  Road  signage  and  markings  are  used  to  impart \ninformation to road users as guides and for safety purposes. In most cases, these signs are \nstandard  and  graphical,  and  are  usually  placed  at  visible  spots  for  easy  recognition  and \nunderstanding, as well as to warn drivers of road conditions. Traffic markings are painted \ninformation features on the road pavement and may be in addition to traffic signs along the \nroadside. Most pertinent to safety are danger warning signs that alert drivers to possible road \nhazards and to the need to be more cautious. These may refer to road conditions, terrain, \ncurvature, or environmental conditions. Signs also show the direction of traffic flow and parking \nplaces, and identify points of interest including rest areas. Rest areas combined with service \nfacilities (i.e., parking lot, fuel and vehicle maintenance station, communication center, sanitary \nequipment, hotel, or restaurant) are integrated in the road construction. Visibility of these road \nsigns at a sufficient distance is important. As the project road will include international traffic, \ninternational standards for signage and markings along the alignment should be adopted.  \n \n12.  Road Safety Fences, Barriers, and Sidewalks. In addition to super elevation, road \nsafety guardrails, crash barriers, safety barriers, and fences are commonly used in elevated \ncurved segments of the road as added safety infrastructure to prevent vehicles from sliding \ndown slopes. These railings and barriers should be of approved materials, preferably with \nconcrete  posts  to  prevent  vehicles  from  rolling  over.  Posts  should  be  painted  for  easy \nrecognition  and  serve  as  driving  aides  when  visibility  is  reduced.  One  example  of  where \nguardrails or barriers are needed is at the exit of Havchig valley near Hovd city, where a \ndangerous hill has numerous bends and sharp curves. In urban areas, sidewalks are necessary. \n \n13.  Lighting Requirements. To enhance road safety at night, road illumination is needed. \nHowever, since most of the road runs through uninhabited areas, this is not practical. Street \nlamps will be provided in certain urban segments of the road. Certain illumination requirements \nmust be provided in the detailed engineering of the road segments in urban areas to provide for \nthe general safety of residents. \n \n14.  General Site Work Safety Requirements. At the site, adequate measures should be \nestablished  to  prevent  accidents.  Contractors  should  submit  the  work  safety  plan  to  the \nsupervising engineer. The plan must include safety of the public and work personnel, property \nprotection, and sanitary and environmental measures. Safety plans should include how to deal \nwith  emergency  situations  at  the  work  site.  The  plan  should  be  comprehensive  and  be \ncommunicated to every member of the work force, including subcontractors. Safety officers \nshould be designated to ensure compliance with safety requirements, and safety notices should \nbe posted at construction sites. Protective fencing should be installed for the safety of residents \nin the area, as well as safe passageway for people and livestock. \n \n15.  The contractor is also expected to effectively liaise and maintain open communication \nwith  neighboring  villages  regarding  safety  measures  and  procedures.  Guards  should  be \n ", "34  Appendix 7 \ndesignated  and  apprised  of  safety  requirements  in  the  construction  area  and  tasked  with \ninforming the public about safety. \n \n16.  Traffic Control during Construction. Prior to construction, signs should be posted to \nnotify drivers of proposed activities, including necessary information regarding speed, traffic \ndirectional flow, and dates of activities. Work personnel should be designated to direct traffic. If \ndetours will be used, adequate directional signs should be in place. The detour road should be \nadequate for slow-moving traffic and be safe and properly maintained for drivability. Road \nbarricades should be set up to separate traffic lanes from lanes under construction. Reflective \npaints should be used for better visibility. During road construction in urban areas, one half of \nthe road is typically closed while the other half remains open to traffic. At the same time, \nconstruction  materials will  be  hauled  to  the site  and construction  workers  will be  present. \nPrecautionary measures should be taken to protect everyone\u2019s safety, including posting signs \nwarning drivers that construction is ongoing and that they should reduce speeds and be alert. \n17.  Safety  Requirements  during  Operation.  In  addition  to  the  infrastructure  safety \nmeasures, road safety plans for road users should be established, and communication and \ncoordination by the maintenance contractors should be established with aimags (provinces) and \nsoums. Public education and awareness of traffic regulations will be promoted and supported \nthrough enhanced and consistent enforcement to encourage improved safety for all road users. \nTraining will be needed to ensure implementation and enforcement of road safety measures. \nTraffic police and road administrators of the local governments from aimags and soums should \nbe trained in traffic management and road safety. \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  35 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A8.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($ million) \n \n% of Total \nForeign  Local  Total \nItem  Project \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nCost \nA.

Monitoring and evaluation have two objectives. The first is to set firm goals and monitor \ntheir  achievement  during  implementation  to  ensure  achievement  of  the  maximum  positive \nimpact for potential beneficiaries. One year after project completion, assessment of whether the \ngoals were achieved is equally important, and provides input for future projects. If the goals \nwere unrealistic, they will need to be modified for future projects. Alternatively, problems may \nresult from the approach and methods used rather than the goals.  \n2.  The second objective is to ensure that the Project does not inadvertently bring harm to \nthose affected by it. As a result, a series of social protections are planned to be implemented. \nSuccess in avoiding harm must also be monitored and evaluated. \n3.  The design and monitoring framework for the Project (Appendix 1) provides a broad \ncontext within which monitoring of socioeconomic impacts in the project impact area will be \nconducted. The project performance monitoring system (Table A13) provides the monitoring \nstructure for the Project within which socioeconomic monitoring will be conducted. \n4.  Baseline Data. To measure the project\u2019s impact, baseline data on the project impact \narea was collected during the household and village surveys carried out during the project \npreparatory technical assistance. The data should be sufficient to test economic and social \nimpacts, including such categories as average monthly income, average number of animals per \nhousehold, household assets, average monthly savings, and number of poor households. \n5.  Project Monitoring. Many of the targeted outputs are jobs created for local residents \nand  workers  from  poor  households.  This  data  should  be  collected  from  the  construction \ncontractors on an annual basis to monitor whether targets are being met and to take corrective \nmeasures as necessary. District governments should be asked to record the number, size, \nturnover, and tax revenue from businesses formed to serve the construction work camps and \ncompany staff. They should also describe the extent of informal income-generating activities \nserving the workers, and physical assets the construction contractors have provided to local \ncommunities. This information should be provided in an annual report to the Ministry of Roads, \nTransport and Tourism. \n6.  To monitor the social protection objectives, each district government should submit a \nbrief annual report certifying that work camp inspections were made and noting any problems \ndetected and corrected. They should also provide a report of public awareness, testing and \ncounseling programs related to HIV/AIDS1 and other communicable diseases conducted at the \nwork camps, and in what manner condoms have been made available to workers and to local \nresidents in the vicinity of work camps. These reports will be reviewed to determine if corrective \nmeasures are needed to ensure the health of workers and local communities. \n7.  Project Evaluation. After completion of construction, annual survey should be carried \nout along the alignment for three years. The results should be reviewed to determine the \neconomic, social, and poverty impacts of the Project. The survey should be accompanied by a \nparticipatory review of impact with villagers, local officials, local businesses, and passengers. In \naddition to the village and household surveys, the project preparatory technical assistance \ncarried out origin and destination passenger surveys and industry surveys. Comparing these \nsurveys  with  traffic  along  the  upgraded  road  will  provide  a  broad  review  of  whether  the \n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "  Appendix 13  43 \nanticipated traffic was accurate. The industry surveys gathered considerable data on industries \nin the area and their anticipated growth records. This information will provide the baseline for a \nrepeat interview process to determine the impact of road upgrading on industry in the project \nimpact area. \n8.  Impact on Poverty. Using the records of the soums (local administrative subdivisions) \nand aimags (provinces) will provide an initial evaluation of whether infrastructure construction \nprojects can have a sustainable impact on raising households above the poverty threshold. \nAbout 1 to 2 years after completion of construction, baseline data will be available on a group of \nworkers, records of several social and economic interventions to address factors leading to \npoverty, records of training and counseling provided regarding planning for future employment \nor business activity, issues encountered in the transition period and implementing the long-term \nplan,  and  success  achieved  in  the  first  year  of  new  employment  or  other  type  of \neconomic/business activity. Some of the data will be quantified and some will be subjective, but \nit  will  provide  a  useful  view  of  the  capacity  of  infrastructure  projects  to  lift  and  sustain \nhouseholds  out  of  poverty.  It  will  provide  a  useful  pilot  that  can  be  applied  by  interested \nprovinces and districts for future infrastructure projects. It will also provide useful input for the \nMinistry of Roads, Transport and Tourism and for the Asian Development Bank on how to \nstructure projects for maximum sustainable poverty reduction impact. \n9.  The number of jobs created as a result of the project road will have a significant impact \non the poor in the project impact area. Of the approximately 13,502 poor, 2,674 would directly \nbenefit from road upgrading. Given this level of benefits, more than 19% of poor households \nwould be elevated from their current poverty status. When taking the secondary benefits into \naccount, such as positive impacts on tourism, mining, and other sectors, the impact on poverty \nis anticipated to be even greater. Through community development projects funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, local residents may receive training in vocational skills, such as driving or \nmachine repair, that will enable them to be employed and improve their overall livelihood. \n \n ", " \nTable A13: Project Performance Management System  4\n4\n   \n    Major Indicators to Be Monitored       \n  Monitoring  (Baseline and target figures to be incorporated  Monitoring  Accountable  Reporting Frequency  A\np\nItem  Tool  into the project administration memorandum)   Agency   Agency  Submission Due Date  p\ne\nSustainability  Socioeconomic  Population, poverty incidence, literacy rate  MRTT  MRTT  Annually   n\nd\nmonitoring report  Update of poverty reduction program of each        ix\n  district      At beginning of the   13\n \nGross regional product, gross regional product      Project \nper capita, retail prices of a selection of      At project completion  \ncommodities       3 years after project \nNumber of registered enterprises      completion  \nProgress of development of local road network    MRTT  MRTT    \nNumber of HIV/AIDS cases in the project area       The indicators will be \ncollected for the \nfollowing groups: \nsample on-route \ndistricts, districts, and \nprovinces. \n  \nViability  Operation report  Traffic volume   MRTT  MRTT  At beginning of the \nNumber of accidents  Project \n  At project completion  \n3 years after project \ncompletion  \n \nAudited financial  Audited project accounts   EIAA  MRTT  Audited financial \nstatement,  Audited financial statements of MRTT  statement = Same as \naudited project  External auditor's checklist   operation report \naccounts  Audited project \naccounts = Same as \nquarterly progress \nreport \n \n  Notice  Notice to proceed, notice of provisional and final  MRTT  MRTT  Within a reasonable \nacceptance of the facilities   time  \n ", "   \n    Major Indicators to Be Monitored       \n  Monitoring  (Baseline and target figures to be incorporated  Monitoring  Accountable  Reporting Frequency \nItem  Tool  into the project administration memorandum)   Agency   Agency  Submission Due Date \nSustainability  Environmental  Implementation of erosion protection plan  To be  MRTT  Semiannually until 2 \nmonitoring and  Replanting of slope vegetation and trees to  nominated  years after provisional \nevaluation report  protect flow at culverts and other natural  acceptance  \ndrainage features   \nTechnical  Quarterly  Implementation schedule  MRTT  MRTT  Quarterly until the \nFeasibility  progress report  Contract award    quarter in which \nDisbursements    physical completion \nPhysical progress by contract   takes place, or the \nUpdate of project cost estimate   grant account with ADB \nNumber of poor for unskilled local labor  is closed, whichever is \nWorkers safety/accidents at construction sites  later.

To determine the current traffic volume on the project road and project future traffic \nvolume, origin/destination surveys were conducted during the feasibility study involving six \nlocations in November 2006 and March 2007. Approximately, 495 interviews were conducted. \nThe  results  of  these  traffic  counts  are  presented  in  Table  A14.1  with  comparison  to  the \nprefeasibility study. \n \nTable A14.1: Feasibility Study and Prefeasibility Study of Traffic Flow  \n(average daily traffic) \n \nSection  Prefeasibility Study (2005)  Feasibility Study (2006) \nYarant (Bulgan)\u2013Hovd  75  371 \nHovd\u2013Olgiy  150  218 \nOlgiy\u2013Russian Federation Border  120  156 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  The difference between the prefeasibility and feasibility studies is mainly attributed to the \nborder  closure  during  the  prefeasibility  study.  The  feasibility  study  was  conducted  with \nconsideration of two substantial changes from the prefeasibility study. That is, traffic flows were \ncaptured when the border was open and a section of the project road had been upgraded by the \nMinistry of Roads, Transport and Tourism. The traffic count data from 2001 to 2006 undertaken \nby the Road Supervision and Research Center were closely examined in the feasibility study. \nAgainst the feasibility study baseline, traffic is projected as presented in Table A14.2. \n \nTable A14.2: Traffic Projection with the Project \n \nYarant\u2013Bulgan  Bulgan\u2013Hovd  Hovd\u2013Olgiy  Olgiy\u2013Ulaanbaishint \nYear \nADT  PCU  ADT  PCU  ADT  PCU  ADT  PCU \n2006  278  368  234  313  168  201  156  205 \n2013  591  1,043  503  937  362  702  405  621 \n2017  989  1,667  846  1,497  610  1,104  658  972 \n2022  1,844  2,958  1,587  2,660  1,146  1,928  1,193  1,690 \n2027  3,272  5,059  2,829  4,557  2,047  3,264  2,080  2,855 \n2032  5,573  8,347  4,841  7,541  3,506  5,351  3,501  4,681 \n  ADT = average daily traffic, PCU = passenger car unit. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The traffic analysis indicates that along the project road, traffic volumes are higher at the \nsouthern than the northern end. The latest data suggests that western Mongolia, being poorer \nthan other regions of the country, may have a higher income elasticity of demand than other \nregions. Against this backdrop, traffic in the affected area after the project road is constructed is \nexpected to grow at an annual rate of more than 10% (Table A14.3). The annual average \ngrowth rates up to 2013 are higher than those after 2013 mainly because of transit trade growth \nprojections. \n ", "  Appendix 14  47 \nTable A14.3: Traffic Growth Forecast along the Project Road \n \nItem   2006  2013  2017  2022  2027  2032 \nYarant\u2013Bulgan  368  1,043.0  1,667.0  2,958.0  5,059.0  8,347.0 \n  Average annual growth (%)    16.0  12.4  12.2  11.3  10.5 \nBulgan\u2013Hovd  313  937.0  1,497.0  2,660.0  4,557.0  7,541.0 \n  Average annual growth (%)    17.0  12.4  12.2  11.4  10.6 \nHovd\u2013Olgiy  201  702.0  1,104.0  1,928.0  3,264.0  5,351.0 \n  Average annual growth (%)    19.6  12.0  11.8  11.1  10.4 \nOlgiy\u2013Ulaanbaishint  205  621.0  972.0  1,690.0  2,855.0  4,681.0 \n  Average annual growth (%)     17.2  11.9  11.7  11.1  10.4 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.

Against this backdrop, travel time savings are estimated at a rate of \n$0.41/hour. \n(iii)  Trade-related  benefits.  These  mainly  comprise  (a)  generated  international \ntransit traffic, (b) increased western Mongolian international trade, (c) customs \nmodernization, and (d) generated tourism. \n \nB.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n4.  The  sensitivity  analysis  results  show  that  the  proposed  road  corridor  remains \neconomically viable under the adverse scenarios tested (Table A15.2). The economic viability is \nconsidered to be robust as the EIRR values are well above 12% in the sensitivity analysis \ncases. The worst case scenario, which seems unlikely, suggests that the proposed road corridor \nwould still meet the 12% rate of return under extreme circumstances. In addition, the switching \nvalues for construction costs and traffic growth for each option were calculated. The results \nsuggest that costs would need to increase by 49.4% to reduce the EIRR to 12%, while benefits \nwould need to be reduced by 33.1% to reduce the EIRR to 12%. \n \nTable 15.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nEIRR  NPV at 12%   Switching Values \nItem \n(%)  ($ million)  (%) \nBaseline:  16.3  49.5 \nScenario:     \n  1.

Distribution Analysis \n \n5.  In terms of the distribution of benefits, Mongolia gets more than 40% of the benefits \n(Table A15.3). Considering that the share of international transit traffic generated benefits is \naround 40%, the estimated direct benefits of the Mongolia component were considered. The \nEIRR without benefits from internationally generated traffic is 12.9% (Table A15.2), indicating \nthat the proposed road corridor would be viable even without internationally generated traffic. \n ", "50  Appendix 15 \n \nTable A15.3: Distribution of Benefits of the Proposed Road Corridor (%) \n \nType of Benefit  Share of Total Benefits \nDomestic Traffic    43.7 \nInternational Transit Traffic Generated    39.7 \nCustoms Modernization    7.5 \nTourism Generated    4.4 \nWestern Mongolian International Trade Increased    3.4 \nDomestic Travel Time    1.4 \n  Total    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Economic Analysis for the Project \n \n6.  Considering that the proposed road corridor will be developed with a phased approach, \nan analysis of the EIRR for the first three construction packages the Project (phase I) (Yarant\u2013\nBulgan\u2013Hovd)  was  undertaken  (Table  A15.4).  The  analysis  indicates  that  phase  I  is \neconomically viable but the EIRR is lower than that for the proposed road corridor as a whole. \nAlthough the road is upgraded for the Yarant\u2013Bulgan\u2013Hovd section, the amount of induced \ninternational and local traffic will be smaller than the traffic forecast under the assumption for the \nwhole road corridor. This will lead to reduced benefits, resulting in the reduced EIRR. \n \nTable A15.4: Summary of Economic Analysis for the Project (Phase I)  \n($ '000) \n \nYear  Capital Cost  Maintenance Cost  Total Benefits  Net Benefits \n2008  1,451  0  0  (1,451) \n2009  3,811  0  0  (3,811) \n2010  24,000  0  0  (24,000) \n2011  24,139  0  0  (24,139) \n2012  15,829  0  0  (15,829) \n2013  3,140  120  2,224  (1,035) \n2014  0  280  5,081  4,801  \n2015  0  440  8,354  7,914 \n2016  0  480  9,166  8,687 \n2017  0  480  10,028  9,548 \n2018  0  480  10,984  10,504 \n2019  0  480  12,016  11,537 \n2020  0  480  13,123  12,643 \n2021  0  480  15,206  14,727 \n2022  0  7,648  16,639  8,992 \n2023  0  480  18,121  17,641 \n2024  0  480  19,800  19,320 \n2025  0  480  21,616  21,137 \n2026  0  480  23,495  23,015 \n2027  0  480  25,407  24,927 \n2028  0  480  27,406  26,926 \n2029  0  480  31,321  30,841 \n2030  0  21,322  33,897  12,575 \n2031  0  480  36,889  36,409 \n ", "  Appendix 15  51 \nYear  Capital Cost  Maintenance Cost  Total Benefits  Net Benefits \n2032  0  480  38,691  38,211 \n2033  0  480  40,214  39,734 \n2034  (36,184)  480  41,811  77,516 \n    Net Present Value = 12%  8,880 \n    Economic Internal Rate of Return =          13.56% \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A15.5: Sensitivity Analysis for the Project (Phase I) \n \nNPV at 12%   Switching Values \nItem  EIRR (%) \n($ million)  (%) \nBaseline:  13.6  8.9   \nScenario:       \n1.

Secondary Benefits from Potential Development Activities \n \n7.  Some important secondary benefits from potential development activities generated as a \nresult of the road upgrading are not included in the economic analysis of the Project. Once they \ncan be measured, the projected EIRR could be much higher. Taking into account the fact that \nan adequate transportation infrastructure must be in place to develop mining industry, the \nproposed  road  may  result  in  the  generation  of  new  industries  and  establishment  of  new \norganizations that will result in added revenue and increased employment for local communities. \n \n8.  Although only an open pit tungsten mine (Khovd Gol) is currently operating in western \nBayan-Olgiy, a silver deposit near Tsagaannuur in northeastern Bayan-Olgiy is being evaluated \nand may be developed within the next several years. The silver mine (Asgat) has a reserve of \napproximately 2,300 tons, but is located in a remote area that is not easily accessible. Most \npromising and commercially viable is a coal deposit with an estimated reserve of 300 plus \nmillion tons, which is located near Hovd aimag (Khusheet). The coal and silver mined may be \nexported to the People\u2019s Republic of China, Russian Federation, or other countries, resulting in \nthe increase of foreign reserves and gross domestic product, thereby positively impacting the \noverall economic development of the country. The development of mines will positively impact \nemployment in the region. Skilled and unskilled labor will be needed to mine the silver or coal, to \nprovide support services to the mine, and to transport the minerals to their ultimate destination. \n \n9.  Domestically, the coal can be used for a wide variety of purposes that positively impact \ndevelopment. It can be used in power plants and to provide heating to cities, villages, and \nhouseholds  throughout  the  western  region.  The  soums  (local  administrative  subdivisions) \nnearby these mines may gain revenue as a direct result of mine operations, including land use \ntaxes and water use fees. The creation of mine sites will also positively impact surrounding \ncommunities. Services such as medical facilities, cafes, bars, hotels, gas stations and repair \nfacilities, and other related establishments will need to be constructed or expanded. Each of \n ", "52  Appendix 15 \nthese businesses will result in increased investment around the mine and the continual flow of \nfunds being directed to them throughout the lifespan of the mine. These additional funds will \nsupport the communities and provide much needed investment to increase the living standards \nof area residents. \n \n10.  Although tourism infrastructure remains limited, this will likely change as travel becomes \neasier and more reliable with improved access. As the Altai region along the project road is \nlisted as one of the virgin or little changed ecoregions in the world,1 its uniqueness will provide \nattractions for more conventional tourism. Various national parks, nature reserves, important \nbird habitat areas, a Ramsar site (convention on wetlands), as well as a range of archeological \nsites also have potential to attract international tourists. Jet service between Ulaanbaatar and \nHovd began recently, reducing the flight time between the cities from over 4 hours to 1.5 hours, \nwhich is also likely to contribute to tourism. \n \n                                                 \n1  Altai region is included in the list of Global 200 by the World Wide Fund for Nature. \n ", "    Appendix 16  53 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The  individual  road  sections  are  consolidated  into  three  construction  packages  of \ncontiguous  sections.  In  addition,  a  package  including  road  sections  that  may  not  require \ninternational financing institution funding is included in the financing plan to indicate the full \namount of Mongolian Government contributions to the entire road improvement project. \n2.  The  proposed  financing  for  the  $112.22  million  project  road  includes  $37.6  million \nequivalent grant financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (33.5% of the total cost) \nand $74.62 million equivalent from the Government (66.5% of the total cost). \n3.  Three types of maintenance work must be financed after completion of the Project:  \n(i)  routine annual maintenance such as pothole repair, crack sealing, guardrails, \ndebris removal, and snow removal; \n(ii)  periodic  maintenance  (every  8  years),  such  as  major  surface  treatments \n(e.g., chip seal); and \n(iii)  rehabilitation of the wearing surface to include scarification of the surface and \napplication of complete overlay (every 16 years). \n \n4.  The existing road user fees and taxes collected throughout Mongolia can be considered \na road user contribution to the cost of road maintenance and development. However, a new \nroad user fee is needed to capture non-Mongolian registered traffic utilizing the project road. \n5.  In determining the value of the road user fee, the annual funding needed for road \nmaintenance must be examined along with the volume of traffic expected to pay the fees. The \nannual cost for maintenance is $0.67 million ($1,562 per kilometer [km]), with $9.31 million \nneeded every 8 years and $25.00 million every 16 years. The rate structure for road user fees \ncollected at the border should be structured so that these maintenance costs are covered by the \nfees. Assuming a road user fee of $5 for light trucks, $7.50 for medium trucks, and $10 for \nheavy trucks, and based on the traffic projections at Mongolia\u2019s borders with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China,1 the road user fees will equal the needed routine maintenance costs before \n2013. The surplus fees collected each year will be applied to additional costs for periodic and \nrehabilitation maintenance. The cumulative surplus will be sufficient to fully cover the periodic \nand rehabilitation maintenance costs, eliminating the need for additional Government funds. \n6.  Construction of the project road is expected to be completed by 2013, meaning that \nperiodic  maintenance  will  be  required  in  2020  and  rehabilitation  will  be  required  in  2028. \nAssuming that traffic flows grow at a steady rate between 2013 and 2031 (Table A16.1), the \ncumulative user fee surplus between 2013 and 2021, when combined with the road user fees \ncollected in 2022, is sufficient to fully cover the periodic maintenance cost. With the same \nassumptions,  the  surplus  accumulated  between  2023  and  2029  would  fund  the  costs  of \nrehabilitation in 2030, when combined with the road user fees collected in that year. \n7.  Financial Management Assessment. The Ministry of Roads, Transport and Tourism \n(MRTT) has accumulated sufficient experience in managing and disbursing ADB funds in the \nlast 5 years and as a result, has established an appropriate organization structure for project \nimplementation and fund management. ADB accounting procedures that are adhered to in \nMongolia define the preparation and approval of transactions and grant utilization reports, as \nwell as the duties and limits of the project implementation unit authority. In accordance with the \n                                                 \n1  Similar road user fees will be enforced at the Russian Federation border after the completion of phase II. \n ", "54  Appendix 16 \nMongolian Accounting Law, MRTT follows international accounting standards and the ADB \nresident mission conducts training for project finance and accounting staff at least twice a year. \nThe MRTT accounting policy was developed with ADB technical assistance;2 the accounting \nstaff  follows  procedure  manuals  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  policy.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nIn the Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (2003), the Government of Mongolia emphasizes road \nnetwork development because roads play a significant role in accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty. In the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program (2006\u20132008) for Mongolia, road development is identified as \nimportant for regional market integration and facilitating the movement of people, goods, and services thus leading to \neconomic development and poverty reduction.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Poverty Classification: General intervention \nAccording to the national household survey\u2014the 2006 household income and expenditure survey\u201432.2% of Mongolia\u2019s \npopulation is living below the poverty line and 38.7% in the western region. In Bayan-Olgiy, 53% of the population have \nmonthly consumption expenditure below the poverty line of MNT20,200 and in Hovd 46%. According to the social survey of \nthe project area, all aimags (provinces) rank the rehabilitation of international and local access roads as a top priority in their \ndevelopment agenda. Due to the proximity to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Russian Federation, Bayan-Olgiy and \nHovd aimags import about 75% of their energy, food, consumer goods, and construction materials from the two countries. The \nProject will greatly contribute to improved linkages to markets in the PRC, Russian Federation, and Kazakhstan through the \nRussian Federation; and improved access to industrial and tourism employment opportunities and social services. The Project \nwill lead to lower transport costs, better access to deliver essential goods from neighboring economies to local communities, \nand employment opportunities during construction. The following are common issues in the area related to poverty:  \n(i)  High unemployment. Lack of job opportunities is one of the main issues. In the western region, the unemployment \nrate was 5.3% in 2004, compared with 3.6% in the country. No significant industry is currently in place to boost the \nregional economy.  \n(ii)  Poor medical facilities. Every soum (local administrative division) has trained medical assistants and primary \nhealth care centers with minimal facilities. However, problems still remain because of the lack of modern facilities for \nspecial treatment at clinics and hospitals, nurses and doctors have not been fully trained in modern treatment \ntechniques, and costs for medical treatment are higher for poor households in the region.  \n(iii)  Unsecured drinking water resource. In Bayan-Olgiy aimag, 12.8% of households have access to water from \nwater distribution stations, compared with 94.5% of households in Hovd aimag; the remainder use water from \nnatural (unprotected) sources such as springs, rivers, and lakes.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Strategy to Address Social Issues \n1.  Create Local Job Opportunities. The implementing agency will require contractors to maximize hiring labor under the \nProject. The Project will generate about 1,300 unskilled construction jobs: 80%, or 1,040 jobs, will be targeted for poor \nhouseholds. In addition, a separate community-based local road and maintenance project funded by the Japan Poverty \nReduction Fund will be implemented to generate additional local employment.  \n2.  Improve Medical Facilities and Drinking Water Resources. The Project allocates $150,000 for community development \nactivities in the project area to respond to social needs such as drinking water development, public baths, vocational training, \nand equipment for community-based enterprises.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \nMore than 6,200 people were consulted during project preparation through public meetings and socioeconomic surveys. \nVarious stakeholders participated in the consultation process, such as central and local government officials, environmental \nexperts, social workers, teachers, doctors, herders, business persons, and road users. Active participation from women in \npublic meetings was confirmed during the fact-finding mission. These processes have enabled: (i) increased awareness and \nlocal support, (ii) expression of opinions and concerns on social and environmental aspects, (iii) relevant suggestions for \nwestern  region  and  local  road  designs  (e.g.,  road  alignments  and  access  roads)  and  future  road  projects,  and \n(vi) identification of potential community development projects.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaboration       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No If a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to \nimplement the plan (including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe participatory activities are an ongoing process that will continue during project implementation. \n ", "56  Appendix 17 \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nWomen in the western aimags do not currently experience gender problems in terms of women\u2019s rights and access to \neducation, health, and other services. However, the country gender assessment identifies growing concerns on emerging \ngender gaps. Despite women\u2019s higher rate of participation in the workforce and educational attainment, the per capita gross \ndomestic product for women is half of that for men ($2,730 versus $1,379) according to 2006 Gender Gaps Report by the \nWorld Economic Forum. A factor is women\u2019s predominant occupation in contracting sectors and men\u2019s dominance in growth \nsectors. Other gender concerns are (i) significantly higher incidence of poverty among households headed by women, (ii) \nwomen\u2019s unemployment rate is double that of men, and (iii) time poverty caused by increased demand for rural women\u2019s labor \nin food production for household consumption. Also the incidence of domestic violence and alcohol abuse is growing. \n2. Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote equality between men\u2019s and women\u2019s/girls\u2019 access to and use \nof relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \nThe Project will ensure that all road maintenance training and employment opportunities will be given and Mongolian labor \nstandard applied to anyone regardless of gender.
