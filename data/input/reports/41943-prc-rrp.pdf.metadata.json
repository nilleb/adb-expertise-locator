If  approved,  the  Project  will  be  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB\u2019s)  first \nnonsovereign  loan  for  a  wind  power  project  in  the  PRC,  and  will  constitute  ADB\u2019s  22nd \nnonsovereign financing in the PRC. The design and monitoring framework and the development \neffectiveness framework are presented in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nWind Power in the People's Republic of China \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Opportunities  \n\n2. \nEnergy use in the PRC is rapidly increasing to support the economic growth needed to \nraise  the  living  standards  of  the  country's  large  population.  The  PRC  has  been  the  second-\nlargest energy consumer after the United States since 1996, and high economic growth coupled \nwith  continued  industrialization  and  urbanization  has  accelerated  growth  in  energy  demand. \nCoal is the dominant available resource for power generation in the country and will continue to \nbe so for the foreseeable future. The PRC accounts for significant share of global greenhouse \ngas emissions, even though a per capita emission is low among the countries with the highest \ngreenhouse  gas  emission.  Forecasts  from  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change \npredicted  that  the  PRC's  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  would  rise  by  about  2.5%\u20135%  each \nyear between 2004 and 2010. Rapid increases in energy demand coupled with supply concerns \nhave  raised  fuel  prices,  leading  to  deep  concerns  about  energy  security.  The  current  energy \npath  relies  on  increased  use  of  fossil  fuels  and  is  neither  environmentally  nor  economically \nsustainable.  \n \n3. \nUse  of  abundant  undeveloped  indigenous  forms  of  clean  energy,  such  as  wind  power, \nhas  significant  potential  to  mitigate  global  climate  change,  address  regional  and  local \nenvironmental  concerns,  reduce  poverty,  and  increase  energy  security.  The  PRC\u2019s  vast  land \narea and long coastline carry enormous wind power potential. The technical potential for wind \npower  in  the  PRC  is  estimated  to  be  about  1,000  gigawatts  (GW),  over  1.5  times  the  PRC\u2019s \ncurrent  electricity  generation  capacity.  The  richest  wind  resources  are  in  the  north  and  the \nsoutheastern coastal areas, with an estimated capacity of 250 GW, and offshore along the east \ncoast,  with  an  estimated  capacity  of  750  GW.  With  an  estimated  capacity  of  150  GW,  Inner \nMongolia has the largest share of wind resources in the country. \n \n4. \nDevelopment  of  the  wind  sector  in  the  PRC  began  only  recently  relative  to  other \ncountries.  By  the  end  of  2007,  cumulative  installed  wind  capacity  was  6  GW.  State-owned \ncompanies dominate the market with the country\u2019s five big power generators (Long Yuan, Hua \nNeng,  Datang,  Hua  Dian,  and  China  Power  Investment)  operating  the  largest  blocks  of  wind \npower  generation  facilities.  At  present,  state  utilities  continue  to  win  concession  tenders,  and \nforeign private sector investors own few assets in the PRC. For wind power projects to achieve \ntheir market potential, the market needs to open further and facilitate higher degrees of private \nsector participation so as to bring fresh capital and expertise into the sector.  \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\nWind  power  remains  by  far  the smallest  segment  of  the  energy  portfolio.  In  addition  to \n5. \ngeneric  barriers,  such  as  the  lack  of  a  mechanism  to  internalize  the  environment  benefits  of \nwind  power,  various  finance-related  risks  and  barriers  are  hindering  faster  growth.  Most  wind \npower  projects  have  high  up-front  capital  costs  relative  to  carbon-emitting  conventional \ntechnologies,  and  also  have  low  rates  of  return.  Many  financial  institutions  therefore  are  not \nready or willing to provide finance in these new areas, or will do so only under very unfavorable \nterms  for  the  project  sponsor.  This  is  particularly  the  case  in  the  PRC,  where  access  to \naffordable  finance  is  difficult  and  relies  on  political  support.  In  addition,  wind  power  projects \noften require local currency financing. In addition to policy frameworks, financial instruments are \nnecessary  to  give  financiers  sufficient  assurance  and  incentive  to  shift  investment  away  from \nconventional technologies to more investment in wind power systems. \n\nFor  the  wind  sector  specifically,  the  Government  has  established  targets  of  10  GW  for \n6. \n2010 and 30 GW for 2020, to reach about 3% of total capacity by this time. With an estimated \nCNY190  billion  ($27.9  billion)  required  to  fund  the  goal  by  2020,  and  state  generators  still \nadvancing  on  the  learning  curve  for  assessing,  building,  and  operating  viable  wind  power \nprojects, further private sector participation is necessary for the sustainable development of the \nwind power sector. Many private sector companies are poised to take advantage of the PRC\u2019s \nvast  wind  power  potential,  and  private  investment  is  playing  a  growing  part  in  wind  power \ngeneration utilizing different business models.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region \n\n7. \nRapid urbanization, industrial development, and income growth have all come late to the \nInner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  after  several  decades  of  lagging  behind  the  PRC\u2019s  other \nprovinces. Inner Mongolia has a population of about 24 million, with only 48.6% living in urban \nareas.  As  one  of  the  12  western  provinces,  its  economy  is  less  developed  than  most  eastern \nprovinces. The average income for urban residents is CNY12,378, which is less than half that of \nthe average of Shanghai urban residents (CNY23,623); the average level for rural residents is \nCNY3,953 in Inner Mongolia, compared with CNY10,222 in Shanghai. Of Inner Mongolia's 101 \ncounties, 31 are national poverty counties and 29 are provincial poverty counties.  \n \nThe  focus  of  wind  power  development  in  Inner  Mongolia  has  been  on  providing  rural \n8. \nareas far from power grids with access to electricity. Some 70,000 herding households in Inner \nMongolia  still  remain  without  access  to  electricity,  and  small-scale  turbines  are  seen  as  an \neffective solution. Much of Inner Mongolia\u2019s installed wind units were small, off-grid systems\u2014\nan important source of distributed power to many of the province\u2019s 11.3 million rural residents.  \n   \n9. \nWith abundant wind resources, developing a commercial wind sector is now an element \nof industrial, energy, and environmental policy. The province\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan emphasizes \nmedium-to-large-scale  wind  facilities.  Inner  Mongolia  has  long-term  plans  to  become  a  major \nsource of power for other provinces. The province was among the leading areas in high-voltage \ngrid  investment  during  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  period,  and  much  of  this  development  was  for \nhigh-voltage export lines to other provinces. Already, Inner Mongolia exports more power than \nany other province, sending 39 terawatt-hour (TWh) in 2005 across three transfer routes: to the \nLiaoning provincial grid, to Liaoning\u2019s parent Northeast China Grid, and to the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nTangshan grid of the North China system. Future plans see Inner Mongolia becoming an even \nlarger exporter via the northern corridor of the west\u2013east transmission scheme. These plans will \nsee western Inner Mongolian eventually serving eastern China markets directly.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPolicies and Regulations \n\n10. \nOver  the  past  decade,  the  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  has \nimplemented a series of renewable energy policies trying to achieve a wide range of goals such \nas rural development, industry development, environmental protection, and energy security.  \n \n11. \nThe  five  goals  for  the  PRC\u2019s  renewable  energy  policy  are  to  improve  the  energy \nstructure,  diversify  energy  supplies,  safeguard  energy  security,  protect  the  environment,  and \nrealize  the  sustainable  development  of  the  economy  and  society.  To  further  encourage  the \ndevelopment  and  commercialization  of  renewable  energy  in  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  system,  the \nGovernment with international support implemented a national-level renewable energy law as a \nnew  policy  framework  for  mainstreaming  renewable  energy  in  the  energy  strategy.  The \nRenewable Energy Law was passed in February 2005 by the National People\u2019s Congress and \nwent into affect on 1 January 2006. The law achieves a major breakthrough for the development \nof renewable energy in the PRC by introducing a preferential tariff mechanism. The Government \nwill impose higher electricity tariffs on all renewable energy to guarantee certain profits for green \nelectricity  generators.  The  grid  companies  are  obliged  to  buy  all  their  electricity  from  qualified \nrenewable energy sources at the agreed tariff (Article 13, 14), and pass on a certain portion of \nthe additional costs associated with renewable energy purchases to be distributed among their \ncustomers  (Article  20).  The  level  of  tariff  will  be  determined  by  the  price  authorities  of  the \nGovernment.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law  is  an  umbrella  document  that  (i)  gives  different \nauthorities the mandates necessary to establish volume targets so as to develop the renewable \nenergy market, and (ii) encourages domestic and foreign investments to reach the targets set. \nThe law is accompanied by a number of supporting regulations that extend the policy principles \ninto  specific  measures  that  address  such  issues  as  price  guidance,  grid  connection,  and \nrenewable energy funds.   \n \n12. \nThe approval process for wind power generation projects is managed at the state level \nfor projects with capacity of 50MW and above, and at the provincial level for projects below 50 \nMW.  Large-scale  projects  are  administered  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  (NDRC)  through  a  concession  bidding  process.  The  NDRC  approved  11  large-\nscale  projects  under  the  four  rounds  of  concessions  held  between  2003  and  2006,  most  of \nwhich  were  awarded  to  subsidiaries  of  the  five  big  power  generators.  This  is  because \nconcession tenders for large-scale projects up until then were primarily awarded to the lowest \nbidder. The five big state-owned power companies can afford to operate the concessions at low \nprofit  margins  because  they  can  subsidize  these  wind  power  projects  with  other  generating \nassets in their large portfolio that yield higher returns. They are also strongly motivated to win \nconcessions  to  meet  quota  requirements.  The  resulting  low  tariffs  threaten  the  long-term \nsustainable  development  of  the  wind  power  sector,  as  it  has  discouraged  private  and  foreign \ninvestors from investing in large-scale projects.  \n \n13. \nFor  small-scale  projects,  project  siting  and  issuing  of  permits  is  initiated  by  the \nGovernment  or  by  developers.  Private  investors  have  been  more  successful  participating  in \nsmall-scale  projects  and  also  find  them  more  attractive  due  to  the  faster  approval  process, \nbetter  tariff  prospects,  and  smaller  investment  involved.  Small-scale  projects  are  negotiated \ndirectly with the relevant local authority, which determines the price for wind power. Pricing data \ncollected from 23 nonconcession projects which the NDRC verified and approved in early 2007 \nshows that some progress towards a sustainable wind pricing policy is being made.  \n \n14.  While most national concession tenders have been won by the large state-owned power \ngenerators  or  their  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  some  state  utilities  such  as  Datang  are  also \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\npartnering  with  local  and  foreign  private  sector  developers  for  small-scale  projects  at  the \nprovincial level. State utilities benefit from the additional capital and operational expertise private \nsector  companies  bring,  while  private  investors  benefit  from  the  local  relationships  already \nestablished by the state utilities.  \n \nB. \n\nADB Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n15. \nThe  Government\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  for  the  period  2006\u20132010  aims  to  build  a \nharmonious and moderately prosperous (xiao kang) society, and differs from the previous five-\nyear  plan  by  taking  a  broader  view  of  growth  that  is  more  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  the  PRC 1  is  based  on  four \ndevelopment  thrusts:  (i)  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  in  part  by  focusing \noperations  on  poorer  provinces  such  as  in  the  central,  western,  and  northeastern  parts  of  the \ncountry;  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability;  (iii)  regional  cooperation  and \npublic goods; and (iv) promoting an environment conducive to private sector development. \n \n16. \nThe PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \nbasis and driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to policy advice to the \nGovernment  on  private  sector  development,  ADB  also  provides  project-based  financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and \nenergy  sectors,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial \nstructuring  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove corporate governance.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLong-Term Strategic Framework \n\nADB's  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework2 emphasizes  a  higher  proportion  of  support  in \n17. \nADB's  lending  portfolio  for  environmentally  sustainable  development  and  private  sector \ndevelopment.  The  strategy  seeks  to  meet  the  region's  growing  energy  demand  by  helping \ndeveloping member countries move their economies onto low-carbon growth paths. Specifically, \nADB will address improving energy efficiency and expanding the use of clean energy sources.  \nThe strategy also aims to promote a larger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure \nby supporting public-private partnerships. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n18. \nADB\u2019s overall energy sector strategy is built upon three key pillars: (i) meeting the rapidly \nincreasing  energy  demand  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region  in  a  sustainable  way,  (ii)  providing \nmodern energy access to all, and (iii) addressing sector reforms and governance. Since 2000, \nmore  attention  has  been  paid  to  environment  and  climate  change  issues.  In  the  most  recent \nCPS  for  the  PRC,  the  target  areas  of  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  road  map  specifically  include \nrenewable energy. In its public sector operations, ADB is involved in a number of efforts to help \nimprove the use of renewable and clean energy in the PRC. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.

The Project involves the construction and operation of \n49.5  MW  of  wind  power  generation  facilities  which  will  generate  an  average  of  133  GWh  of \nelectricity annually.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Sponsors \n\n1. \n\nChina Datang Corporation \n\n \nChina  Datang  Corporation,  one  of  the  five  large-scale  power  generation  enterprises  in \n21. \nthe PRC, was established in December 2002 as part of the division of generation assets of the \nformer  State  Power  Corporation  of  China.  It  is  a  solely  state-owned  corporation  directly \nmanaged  by  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  Central  Committee  and  is  the  experimental  state-\nauthorized investment and state shareholding enterprise ratified by the State Council.  \n \n22. \nDatang  is  involved  in  all  aspects  of  power  generation,  with  almost  65  GW  of  installed \ncapacity, operating 97 power plants across 19 municipalities, and generating close to 305,000 \nGWh  in  2007  using  thermal,  hydropower,  and  renewable  resources.  In  wind  power,  Datang \ncurrently owns and manages 1,030 MW of installed capacity and has an additional 1,000 MW \nunder development.  \n \n\n2. \n\nKyushu Electric Power Company \n\n \n23. \nKyushu  Electric  Power  Company  (Kyuden)  is  the  fourth-largest  of  the  10  Japanese \nintegrated  electric  power  companies.  The  company  generates,  transmits,  and  distributes \nelectricity  to  the  Kyushu  region,  which  covers  about  11%  of  Japan's  territory,  10.5%  of  the \npopulation, and 8.7% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) (comparable to the national \nGDP  of  Australia).  In  FY2007,  Kyuden  supplied  88.08  billion  kWh  of  electricity  for  power  and \nlighting  to  8.42  million  users.    The  company  operates  194  generation  facilities  with  a  total \ncapacity of 19.42 GW. Kyuden is constructing a 50.4 MW wind power generation facility which \nwill  be  operational  in  October  2008.  Kyuden\u2019s  investment  in  the  Project  will  be  made  via  its \nwholly owned subsidiary, Kyuden International Corporation. \n \n\n3. \n\nSumitomo Corporation  \n\n \n24. \nSumitomo  Corporation  (Sumitomo)  is  Japan\u2019s  third-largest  general  trading  company.  It \nwas established in 1919 and has a global network that includes 100,000 business partners and \ncustomers  and  180  offices  and  subsidiaries.  Sumitomo\u2019s  Infrastructure  Business  Unit  is \npromoting  the  broadening  of  Sumitomo\u2019s  earnings  base  in  the  fields  of  electric  power,  power \nplant  engineering,  eco  and  energy-saving  businesses,  and  social  and  industrial  infrastructure, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n \n\nespecially  in  Asia.  The  company  aims  to  establish  a  retail  power  supply  capacity  of  500  MW \ndomestically and increase its retained power generation capacity to 6,300 MW outside of Japan \nby  2010  by  concentrating  on  independent  water  and  power  producer  projects,  particularly  in \nAsia. At the same time, Sumitomo plans to expand the supply of renewable energy, especially \nwind  power  and  biomass  projects,  as  well  as  promote  greenhouse  gas  reduction  projects  in \ndeveloping  countries.  In  wind  power  generation,  Sumitomo  currently  has  two  sites  under \nmanagement, both in Japan, totaling 32 MW. \n\n \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Aspect \n\nComprehensive  environmental  impact  studies  were  completed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \n25. \nenvironmental  safeguard  policies  for  environmental  category  B  projects.  The  perceptible \nenvironmental impacts are noise and visual impacts, but both are considered to be insignificant \nat  most,  given  the  considerable  setback  of  turbines  from  the  nearest  settlements  and  the \nlandscape values of the site. The impact from the operating turbines is unlikely to be significant \nsince the turbines are set 5 km from the nearest village. The landscapes that are to be affected \nvisually from turbine placement do not appear to have any unique features. The environmental \ndisturbance  normally  associated  with  construction  activities  (i.e.,  land  disturbance,  vegetation \nclearance,  erosion  and  sedimentation,  construction  noise  and  traffic,  and  waste  generation)  is \nlimited  extent  and  significance  of  consequences. \nconsidered \nImplementation  of \nincludes  monitoring \narrangements during project operations, will largely mitigate these impacts.  \n \n\nthe  environmental  management  plan,  which \n\ntemporary  due \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n2. \n\nSocial Aspect \n\n26. \n The Project site is hilly barren land in a remote area, it is not being used for grazing, and \nno herders live around it. No resettlement or social hardships are anticipated as a result of the \nProject.  The  potential  social  impacts  on  the  local  communities  are  considered  minimal.  There \nare no indigenous people or ethnic minorities in the Project site or along transmission lines. No \nlands or natural resources used for cultural and social activities are involved in the construction \nof  the  Project  and  other  supporting  facilities.  Thus,  under  the  IP  policy,  no  action  will  be \nrequired. The Project is considered to be category C in terms of both involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous people. \n\n \nDevelopment Impacts \n\nD. \n\n1. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\nThe Project will promote sustainable growth and environmental improvement in the PRC \n27. \nthrough  contributions  towards  achieving  minimum-share  targets  for  renewable  energy  in  the \ngeneration  mix,  and  for  wind  power  generation  in  particular.  The  impact  of  catalyzing  private \nsector investment in the PRC\u2019s renewable energy sector will mitigate significant greenhouse gas \nemissions  and  improve  the  energy  security  of  the  country  by  developing  indigenous  energy \nsources.  The  Project  features  a  strong  model  for  private  sector  participation  in  renewable \nenergy through a successful collaboration between one of the five established big local power \ncompanies  and  foreign  strategic  investors  with  expertise  in  wind  power,  and  thus  encourages \nthe private sector to invest in wind power projects beyond the Project\u2019s interventions.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n28. \nThe  Project  has  been  assessed  and  described  from  the  perspectives  of  development \neffectiveness and project framework in terms of private sector development, business success, \nand economic sustainability as per the good practice standards for evaluation of private sector \ninvestment  operations,  which  were  prepared  by  the  evaluation  cooperation  group  of  the \nmultilateral development banks.  \n \nBeyond  enhancing  the  Project\u2019s  financial  and  economic  sustainability,  the  Project  will \n29. \nsupport  private  sector  development  by  strengthening  a  new  business  model  of  collaboration \nbetween  a  state-owned  enterprise  and  foreign  private  sector  investors.  Further  private  sector \nparticipation  will  increase  the  competition,  operational  efficiency,  and  corporate  governance  in \nthe  wind  power  generation  sector.  Being  the  first  private  sector  wind  farm  funded  by  ADB \nprivate  sector  operations  in  the  county,  the  Project  will  have  a  demonstration  effect  for  future \nprivate  sector  investments  in  wind generation using  this  model.  In  its modest  way,  the  Project \nwill  also  contribute  to  the  implementation  process  of  the  newly  introduced  Renewable  Energy \nLaw, and mandatory off-take and preferential tariff revision in particular.  Moreover, the longer \ntenor and local currency offered by the ADB loan, which is not available to foreign investors in \nthe local market, will improve private sector financial institutions\u2019 confidence in the wind power \nsector to provide such financial assistance to similar projects going forward. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\n \nA. \n\nLoan \n\n30. \nADB will provide a local currency loan of up to CNY164 million from its ordinary capital \nresources  to  the  joint  venture  without  a  government  guarantee.  The  loan  will  carry  an  interest \nrate,  as  well  as  commitment  and  front-end  fees,  to  be  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  pricing  and  credit \nenhancement committee. \n \n31. \nThe  loan  agreement  will  include  (i)  appropriate  representations  and  warranties;  (ii) \ncovenants, including affirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events \nof default. \n \nB. \n\nJustification \n\nThe proposed loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n\nThe Project will support the Government\u2019s policy to protect the environment and \nincrease energy security by increasing the proportion of electricity generated with \nindigenous renewable energy and by diversifying the energy mix. The Project is \nin line with the Government\u2019s strategy of encouraging private sector participation \nin  renewable  energy  infrastructure,  given  the  substantial  level  of  investment \nrequired.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  economic  development  of  Inner \nMongolia,  which  is  also  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region \nDevelopment  Strategy  and  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  to  enhance  economic \ndevelopment and reduce poverty in the central and western PRC.   \n\nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s CPS for the PRC (footnote 2), which is based on \nfour  PRC  development  objectives:  (i)  promoting  equitable  and  inclusive  growth, \n(ii)  making  markets  work  better,  (iii)  improving  the  environment,  and  (iv) \n\n32. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\npromoting  regional  cooperation.  The  CPS  specifically  includes  clean  energy \ndevelopment and inclusive growth. The Project will help to raise the standards of \nthe population in Inner Mongolia, arrest environmental degradation, and advance \nsustainable inclusive development.  \n\nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC, which \nfocus  on  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors,  the  financial  sector,  and \nenvironmental  improvements.  In  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors,  ADB \nprioritizes  playing  a  pioneering  role,  enhancing  management  expertise,  and \nimproving  corporate  governance.  This  Project  will  provide  highly  skilled \nemployment and know-how transfer opportunity to the joint venture. \n\nThe  Project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  that  recommends  a \nreorientation  of  energy  sector  activities \nto  address  regional  and  global \nenvironmental  impacts.  By  introducing  clean  technologies,  the  Project  will \naddress  regional  and  global  environmental  problems  by  reducing  greenhouse \ngas emissions.  \n\nThe  presence  of  ADB  will  reassure  the  sponsors  that  the  local  government  will \ncontinue  to  support  this  Project  throughout  its  life.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the \nProject  is  expected  to  establish  more  confidence  in  future  private  sector \nparticipation and financing in wind power projects in the PRC.  \n\nThe proposed loan, which will provide long-term yuan financing, will offer the best \npossible  solution  to  the  joint  venture  under  current  market  circumstances.  The \njoint venture values such financing by ADB since such a product is not available \nto  foreign  companies  in  the  current  PRC  markets.  As  all  of  the  joint  venture\u2019s \nrevenues are in yuan, local currency financing helps avoid a currency mismatch \nbetween  revenue  and  expenditure.  The  long-term  loan  will  increase  stability  of \nthe Project\u2019s operation. This will also help to make wind energy generation in the \nPRC more sustainable, thereby encouraging more investments by private sector \ncompanies. \n\n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n33. \nThe  proposed  loans,  which  comprise  ADB\u2019s  22nd  nonsovereign  financing  in  the  PRC, \nwill increase ADB\u2019s total nonsovereign exposure in the PRC from 20.35% to 20.82% of ADB\u2019s \naggregate  nonsovereign  operations  portfolio.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  ADB\u2019s  aggregate \ncountry, industry, single, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAnticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n\n34. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  Combating  Money \nLaundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003)  were  explained  to  the  joint  venture. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the joint venture to maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The financing documentation between ADB and the joint venture will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n \n\nV.  ASSURANCES \n\n \n35. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nthe  joint  venture.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB  will \nenter into suitable documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval \nof the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \nCNY164,000,000,  without  government  guarantee,  to  Datang  Sino-Japan  (Chifeng)  Renewable \nPower Company Limited for the Inner Mongolia Wind Power Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, and on such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n11 August 2008 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING AND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS FRAMEWORKS \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\n \nImpact \n \nSustainable growth \nof PRC\u2019s economy \nby diversifying the \nenergy mix through \nthe addition of \nrenewable energy \ncapacity \n  \nProtection of the \nenvironment \n \n\n \nOutcome \n \nIncreased installed \ncapacity of \nrenewable energy  \n \nIncreased private \nsector finance in \nPRC\u2019s renewable \nenergy sector \n \n \nMitigation of \ngreenhouse gas \nemissions \n \n\n \nOutputs \n \nInstallation and \noperation at \ndesigned \nperformance level of \n49.5 MW wind power \ngenerating facility \nand associated \ninfrastructure  \n \n\n \n\nTable A1.1: Design and Monitoring Framework \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets and/or \nIndicators \n\n \n \n\n \nRenewable energy \ncomprises 16% of total \npower generation by 2020 \n \nGovernment target for \nwind is 10 GW by 2010 \nand 30 GW by 2020 \n \nReduction in greenhouse \ngas emissions through \nreplacement of electricity \nproduced by conventional \ncoal-fired plants \n \n\n \n \n \nIncreased private sector \nparticipation in wind \npower projects by 10% in \nInner Mongolia by 2013 \n \nIncreased commercial \nbanks\u2019 finance in wind \npower projects by 10% in \nInner Mongolia by 2013 \n \nProject generates savings \nof about 140,000 tons of \nCO2 annually during the \nfirst 25 years of operation \n \n\n \n \n \nCompletion of \nconstruction by October \n2009 \n \nSale of 133 GWh per year \n \n \n\nData Sources \nand/or \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nNational \nmacroeconomic data \n \n \nPower sector \nstatistics, as reported \nby local and national \nregulators \n \n \n\n \n \n \nStatistics and \ninformation disclosed \nby the regulator and \nstate government \nagencies \n \nJoint venture reports \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  Continued \n\nmacroeconomic and \npolitical stability \n \n\n\u2022  Continued support for \nwind power sector \nreforms \n\n \nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  The Project is \n\ncompleted in a timely \nmanner \n \n\n\u2022  Offtaker\u2018s compliance  \nwith their purchase and \npayment commitments \n  \n\n\u2022  Stable and consistent \nregulatory policies for \nthe renewable energy \nsector and private \nsector investment \n\n \n \n \nJoint venture reports \n \nStatistics and \ninformation \ndisclosure by the \nregulator and state \ngovernment \nagencies \n \n\n \nAssumption \n \n\u2022  Construction and O&M \ncontractors perform in a \ntimely manner and in \naccordance with \nguaranteed \nperformance standards \nas per respective \ncontracts \n\n \n\n\fDesign Summary \n\nPerformance \nTargets and/or \nIndicators \n\nData Sources \nand/or \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nActivities with Milestones \n \n1.
