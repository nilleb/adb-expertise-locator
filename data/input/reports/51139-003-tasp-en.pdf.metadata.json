THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) cluster is designed to complement the \nproposed  loan  of  up  to  $100,000,000  to  Olam  International  Limited  (OIL)  and  two  of  its \nsubsidiaries. The loan will support the $223,000,000 capex and expansion plan of OIL and its \nsubsidiaries (Olam) over the 2017-2019 period and invest in Olam\u2019s midstream processing assets \nand permanent working capital for smallholder farmer supply in Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua \nNew Guinea (PNG), and Viet Nam.1 The project will promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural \nvalue chains with higher local value addition in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The TA subproject \nwill complement the loan by providing capacity building support to 6,000 smallholder coffee \nfarmers that Olam sources from in Indonesia.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n2.  The TA cluster is expected to be approved in December 2017. The TA cluster will be \nimplemented over 3.5 years, from November 2017 to September 2021, with start dates and \nduration for each subproject indicated in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  Budget \nSubproject 1  Indonesia   December 2017\u2013September 2020  $750,000 \nSubproject 2  Timor-Leste  April 2018\u2013September 2020  $1,200,000 \nSubproject 3  Viet Nam  October 2018\u2013March 2020  $750,000 \nSubproject 4  Papua New Guinea  April 2019\u2013September 2021  $300,000 \nSources: Olam; Asian Development Bank. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n3.  The TA subproject will help smallholder coffee farmers in Indonesia fully benefit from their \ninclusion in the coffee value chain by improving the productivity and quality of crops, and meeting \ninternational certification standards. The subproject will also ensure that these farmers are better \nprepared to cope with the negative consequences of climate change. The scope of the TA \nsubproject will be limited to the activities of the TA cluster in Indonesia.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Impacts and outcome of the TA subproject are in line with the financing project. Impacts \nare: (i) double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through \ninputs, knowledge, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment, (ii) \nensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that \nincrease productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for \nadaptation to climate change, and (iii) significant increase in the exports of developing countries. \nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  In order of start dates (see Table 1). \n ", "2   \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities \n1.

The TA cluster is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $650,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Other) and $100,000, for the \ncomponents related to climate change adaptation, will be financed by the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and \nadministered by ADB.2  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n6.  ADB will administer the TA subproject from December 2017 to September 2020. Olam will \nbe the recipient of the TA subproject as Olam is best positioned to coordinate the work of the \nconsulting firms and share learning with farmers, the government, and other stakeholders in the \nproject countries. Because of Olam sources from the smallholder farmers directly or through local \nbuying agents, the company has a relationship with farmers and will ensure that they fully benefit \nfrom the TA subproject. The interests of Olam and the farmers are aligned in relation to the TA \n                                                \n2  TASF-Other financing will draw on 2017 and 2018 funds, to maximize use of available resources. $400,000 will draw \non 2017 TASF-Other funds and $250,000 of will draw on 2018 TASF-Other funds.  \n ", "  3 \n \nsubproject outcome, since if smallholder coffee farmers grow more, at a better quality, Olam \ncontinues to satisfy customer demand for high-quality, sustainable products. Olam has the \nfinancial  and  administrative  capacity  to  provide  the  required  in-kind  contributions  to  the \nconsultants and ensure successful implementation of the TA subproject.  \n \n7.

While coffee is Timor-Leste\u2019s largest non-oil \nexport and is grown by 38%1 of all Timorese households, more than half of the coffee planted \narea consists of unproductive old trees resulting in low yields.2 Coffee production in Timor-Leste \nis de-facto organic, but only around 25% of exports have certification. Several companies and \nNGO-supported programs have established systems that ensure some degree of traceability of \ncoffees from farm-gate to export. However, most coffee exports pass through trader networks and \nare not traceable to the farm level. In PNG, coffee production is also the backbone of the rural \neconomy and accounts for 30% of the total labor force. The vast majority of coffee produced in \nIndonesia and Viet Nam, the second and third largest coffee producing countries, is grown by \nsmallholders on farms averaging around one hectare whose livelihoods depend on a successful \ncoffee crop.  \n \nSmallholder coffee farmers across these countries face common challenges that include lack of \naccess to finance and quality inputs, low yields, lack of storage and market infrastructure, limited \nlocal value addition, and dependence on middlemen. Coffee production in Timor-Leste, despite \nhaving one of the lowest yields in the world (150-200 kg per ha), is de-facto organic, but only \naround 25% of exports have certification. In PNG, the quality and productivity of coffee has been \ndeclining and smallholder farmers\u2019 yields are 50-60% below their potential.3 In Viet Nam, the \nconsequences of heavy use of fertilizer and other agro-chemicals range from deforestation and \nfishery resource depletion, to a growing incidence of land degradation and water pollution.4 In \nIndonesia, low yields (three times lower than that of Viet Nam5) are due to the penetration rate of \nextension services and better technologies being very low among smallholder coffee farmers. \nClimate change is a serious threat to countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, especially in \nthe agriculture sector. Timor-Leste and PNG are the two most vulnerable countries to climate \nchange in the Pacific with economic losses from climate change expected to reach 15% of PNG\u2019s \nannual gross domestic product and 10% of Timor-Leste\u2019s by 2100.6 Both countries are expected \nto experience a temperature increase of more than 2.5\u00b0C on average by 2070 (footnote 3). Viet \nNam has been listed by the World Bank as one of the five countries that will be worst-affected by \nclimate change given its high exposure to floods and storms, and the fact that two of its most \nimportant economic sectors \u2013 industry and agriculture \u2013 are located in coastal lowlands and \ndeltas.7 Indonesia, the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the developing world after \n                                                \n1  Government of Timor-Leste. 2016.

Certification may be a suitable tool to achieve this in some \ncases. A holistic climate-smart agriculture training program including training sessions, field trials, \nand demonstration farms will ensure that farmers better cope with the negative consequences of \nclimate change. The TA will build on the mobile technology platform that Olam is building (OFIS) \nto ensure that it directly benefits farmers by  personalized  assessment (annual), training, planning \nand better access to market information. The TA will also encourage implementation of coffee \ngrading and quality based pricing among the farmer groups. The TA will help connect farmers \ndirectly to potential customers of certified conventional and specialty coffees which should help \nfarmers realize better value just because of the premiums involved. The use of OFIS improves \ninformation on (potential) farmer production and assists with traceability, allowing Olam to offer \nlarger, more secure coffee volumes to customers \u2013 which in turn results in coffee sales becoming \na more secure and lucrative livelihood option for farmers.  \nThe TA will also encourage institution building and establishment of industry standards in select \ncountries  through  the  development  of  coffee  grading  systems  and  unified  information \nmanagement system. The TA is a piggyback TA which will help realize the projected impact of \nthe financing project. The TA will help farmers be included in the global coffee supply chain by \nhelping them adopt sustainable farming practices and increasing their production and quality, and \nultimately, income. \nA.  Scope of Service \n \nThe project will be designed around the registration of 20,000 new farmers (including 6,000 in \nIndonesia) into the Olam Farmer Information System (OFIS). This requires building on-the-gournd \nrelationships with farmers and collecting data through a baseline and annual surveys. Information \ncollected should be used to design training programs including Good Agricultural Practices, \nIntegrated Pest Management, and Climate Smart Agriculture. The setting up and running of a \nseries of coffee demo plots will provide accurate information on local coffee growing conditions, \nthus informing training content and providing training sites for farmers.  \nFarm level demonstration plots will be broadly modelled a World Coffee Research methodology \nbeing used locally, with the following characteristics:  \n(i)  Located on individual farmers\u2019 land and broadly representative of size / growing \nconditions faced by other farmers in the immediate vicinity;  \n(ii)  Managed according to a design that is centrally coordinated and that involves \n\u2018side-by-side\u2019 application of different treatments / practices.  \n(iii)  Supported by careful data collection and monitoring to enable clear evaluation of \nthe economic returns of different \u2018improvements\u2019 or changes in farming practices.  \n(iv)  Providing  clear  visual  evidence  to  nearby  farmers,  and  micro-data  for  more \naggregated analysis.  \n \nOFIS will be used to generate individual farm management plans and the project will supply inputs \nand advice to implement these effectively. Improvements in productivity, coffee quality and farmer \nlivelihoods are key measures of success. (Organic) certification and/or OLC certification may be \nuseful tools for delivering/measuring these. Each project country (i.e., Timor-Leste, PNG, Viet \nNam, Indonesia) will have a separate contract. For efficiency, consulting firms are encouraged to \nbid for more than one of the four contacts. \n ", "3 \n \nThe firm will report to the ADB project officer through the assignment team leader and will perform \nthe following (figures for Timor-Leste, Viet Nam and PNG are reference purpose only): \n \n1.
