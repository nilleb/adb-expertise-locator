The  loan will  support the  $223,000,000  capex  and  expansion  plan  of OIL and  its \nsubsidiaries (Olam) over the 2017-2019 period and invest in Olam\u2019s midstream processing assets \nand permanent working capital for smallholder farmer supply in Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua \nNew Guinea (PNG), and Viet Nam.1 The project will promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural \nvalue chains with higher local value addition in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The TA subproject \nwill  complement  the  loan  by  providing  capacity  building  support  to  6,000  smallholder  coffee \nfarmers that Olam sources from in Indonesia.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n\nOverall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  TA  cluster  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  December  2017.  The  TA  cluster  will  be \n2. \nimplemented  over  3.5  years,  from  November  2017  to  September  2021,  with  start  dates  and \nduration for each subproject indicated in Table 1. \n\n \nTable 1: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \n\nSubproject Title \n\nItem \nSubproject 1 \nSubproject 2 \nSubproject 3  Viet Nam \nSubproject 4  Papua New Guinea \n\nIndonesia  \nTimor-Leste \n\nSources: Olam; Asian Development Bank. \n \nSubproject Scope \n\nImplementation Period \n\nBudget \n\nDecember 2017\u2013September 2020  $750,000 \nApril 2018\u2013September 2020 \nOctober 2018\u2013March 2020 \nApril 2019\u2013September 2021 \n\n$1,200,000 \n$750,000 \n$300,000 \n\nSubproject Outputs and Activities \n\nB. \n \n3. \nThe TA subproject will help smallholder coffee farmers in Indonesia fully benefit from their \ninclusion in the coffee value chain by improving the productivity and quality of crops, and meeting \ninternational certification standards. The subproject will also ensure that these farmers are better \nprepared  to  cope  with  the  negative  consequences  of  climate  change.  The  scope  of  the  TA \nsubproject will be limited to the activities of the TA cluster in Indonesia.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nImpacts and outcome of the TA subproject are in line with the financing project. Impacts \nare:  (i)  double the  agricultural  productivity  and  incomes  of  small-scale  food  producers  through \ninputs, knowledge, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment, (ii) \nensure  sustainable food  production  systems  and  implement  resilient  agricultural  practices  that \nincrease productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for \nadaptation to climate change, and (iii) significant increase in the exports of developing countries. \nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n1  In order of start dates (see Table 1). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\nMajor Outputs \n1.

Olam will \nbe the  recipient  of the TA  subproject  as Olam  is  best  positioned  to coordinate the  work  of the \nconsulting firms and share learning with farmers, the government, and other stakeholders in the \nproject countries. Because of Olam sources from the smallholder farmers directly or through local \nbuying agents, the company has a relationship with farmers and will ensure that they fully benefit \nfrom the TA subproject. The interests of Olam and the farmers are aligned in relation to the TA \n                                                \n2  TASF-Other financing will draw on 2017 and 2018 funds, to maximize use of available resources. $400,000 will draw \n\nSubproject Implementation Arrangements \n\non 2017 TASF-Other funds and $250,000 of will draw on 2018 TASF-Other funds.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nsubproject  outcome,  since  if  smallholder  coffee  farmers  grow  more,  at  a  better  quality,  Olam \ncontinues  to  satisfy  customer  demand  for  high-quality,  sustainable  products.  Olam  has  the \nfinancial  and  administrative  capacity  to  provide  the  required  in-kind  contributions  to  the \nconsultants and ensure successful implementation of the TA subproject.  \n \n7. \nOlam  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  the  terms  of  a  draft  TA  subproject  implementation \nagreement.

While coffee is Timor-Leste\u2019s largest non-oil \nexport and is grown by  38%1 of all Timorese households, more than half of the coffee planted \narea consists of unproductive old trees resulting in low yields.2 Coffee production in Timor-Leste \nis de-facto organic, but only around 25% of exports have certification. Several companies and \nNGO-supported programs have established systems that ensure some degree of traceability of \ncoffees from farm-gate to export. However, most coffee exports pass through trader networks and \nare not traceable to the farm level. In PNG, coffee production is also the backbone of the rural \neconomy and accounts for 30% of the total labor force. The vast majority of coffee produced in \nIndonesia and  Viet  Nam, the second  and third largest  coffee  producing countries,  is grown by \nsmallholders on farms averaging around one hectare whose livelihoods depend on a successful \ncoffee crop.  \n \nSmallholder coffee farmers across these countries face common challenges that include lack of \naccess to finance and quality inputs, low yields, lack of storage and market infrastructure, limited \nlocal value addition, and dependence on middlemen. Coffee production in Timor-Leste, despite \nhaving  one of  the  lowest  yields  in the  world  (150-200 kg per ha),  is  de-facto  organic,  but  only \naround 25% of exports have certification. In PNG, the quality and productivity of coffee has been \ndeclining  and  smallholder  farmers\u2019  yields  are  50-60%  below  their  potential.3 In  Viet  Nam,  the \nconsequences of heavy use of fertilizer and other agro-chemicals range from deforestation and \nfishery  resource  depletion,  to  a  growing  incidence  of  land  degradation  and  water  pollution.4 In \nIndonesia, low yields (three times lower than that of Viet Nam5) are due to the penetration rate of \nextension services and better technologies being very low among smallholder coffee farmers. \n\nClimate change is a serious threat to countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, especially in \nthe  agriculture  sector.  Timor-Leste and  PNG  are  the  two  most  vulnerable  countries to  climate \nchange in the Pacific with economic losses from climate change expected to reach 15% of PNG\u2019s \nannual gross domestic product and 10% of Timor-Leste\u2019s by 2100.6 Both countries are expected \nto experience a temperature increase of more than 2.5\u00b0C on average by 2070 (footnote 3). Viet \nNam has been listed by the World Bank as one of the five countries that will be worst-affected by \nclimate change given  its  high  exposure  to floods  and storms,  and the fact that two of  its  most \nimportant  economic  sectors  \u2013  industry  and  agriculture  \u2013  are  located  in  coastal  lowlands  and \ndeltas.7 Indonesia,  the  third  largest  emitter  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  developing  world  after \n\n                                                \n1  Government of Timor-Leste. 2016.

Certification  may  be  a  suitable  tool  to  achieve  this  in  some \ncases. A holistic climate-smart agriculture training program including training sessions, field trials, \nand demonstration farms will ensure that farmers better cope with the negative consequences of \nclimate change. The TA will build on the mobile technology platform that Olam is building (OFIS) \nto ensure that it directly benefits farmers by  personalized  assessment (annual), training, planning \nand better access to market information. The TA will also encourage implementation of coffee \ngrading and quality based pricing among the farmer groups. The TA will help connect farmers \ndirectly to potential customers of certified conventional and specialty coffees which should help \nfarmers realize better value just because of the premiums involved. The use of OFIS improves \ninformation on (potential) farmer production and assists with traceability, allowing Olam to offer \nlarger, more secure coffee volumes to customers \u2013 which in turn results in coffee sales becoming \na more secure and lucrative livelihood option for farmers.  \n\nThe TA will also encourage institution building and establishment of industry standards in select \ncountries  through  the  development  of  coffee  grading  systems  and  unified  information \nmanagement system. The TA is a piggyback TA which will help realize the projected impact of \nthe financing project. The TA will help farmers be included in the global coffee supply chain by \nhelping them adopt sustainable farming practices and increasing their production and quality, and \nultimately, income. \n\nScope of Service \n\nA. \n \nThe project will be designed around the registration of  20,000 new farmers (including 6,000 in \nIndonesia) into the Olam Farmer Information System (OFIS). This requires building on-the-gournd \nrelationships with farmers and collecting data through a baseline and annual surveys. Information \ncollected  should  be  used  to  design  training  programs  including  Good  Agricultural  Practices, \nIntegrated  Pest  Management,  and  Climate  Smart  Agriculture.  The  setting  up  and  running  of  a \nseries of coffee demo plots will provide accurate information on local coffee growing conditions, \nthus informing training content and providing training sites for farmers.  \nFarm level demonstration plots will be broadly modelled a World Coffee Research methodology \nbeing used locally, with the following characteristics:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nLocated on individual farmers\u2019 land and broadly representative of size / growing \nconditions faced by other farmers in the immediate vicinity;  \nManaged  according  to  a  design  that  is  centrally  coordinated  and  that  involves \n\u2018side-by-side\u2019 application of different treatments / practices.  \nSupported by careful data collection and monitoring to enable clear evaluation of \nthe economic returns of different \u2018improvements\u2019 or changes in farming practices.  \nProviding  clear  visual  evidence  to  nearby  farmers,  and  micro-data  for  more \naggregated analysis.  \n \n\nOFIS will be used to generate individual farm management plans and the project will supply inputs \nand advice to implement these effectively. Improvements in productivity, coffee quality and farmer \nlivelihoods are key measures of success. (Organic) certification and/or OLC certification may be \nuseful  tools  for  delivering/measuring  these.  Each  project  country  (i.e.,  Timor-Leste,  PNG,  Viet \nNam, Indonesia) will have a separate contract.
