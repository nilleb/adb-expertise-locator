The report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Enhancing  Gender  Equality  and  Social \nInclusion in Rural Electrification, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n   \nThe project will construct 44 substations and about 1,006 kilometers (km) of 66 kV and 33 \n2. \nkV  distribution  lines  in  Ayeyarwady,  Bago  (East),  and  Magway  regions;  and  Kayin  State  in \nMyanmar.  The  project  will  establish,  for  the  first  time  in  Myanmar,  a  computerized  distribution \nautomation  system  (DAS)  to  improve  the  operational  efficiency  and  management  of  the \ndistribution systems.1 The project will enable the government to electrify an additional 400,300 \nhouseholds in 2,815 villages, contributing to the achievement of the country\u2019s plan of universal \nelectricity access by 2030. The project aims to support Myanmar\u2019s inclusive growth by expanding \nelectricity access in rural areas; and improve the project regions\u2019 response to the impacts of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic through better access to information, education, and \nwork opportunities. The TA will support the empowerment of women in villages for the safe and \nproductive use of electricity in the project areas.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nMacroeconomic  context.  Myanmar sustained strong  growth  averaging  6.4%  in  2015\u2013\n3. \n2019, buoyed by the boom in manufacturing, construction, tourism, and services and increased \nforeign investment. The poverty rate decreased from 42.4% in 2010 to 28.4% in 2017. 2 However, \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic  threatens  to  undermine  the  strong  progress,  and  the  growth  rate  for \n2020  has  been  revised  downward  from  6.8%  to  1.8%. 3 To  mitigate  the  adverse  social  and \neconomic  impacts  of  the  pandemic,  the  government  is  implementing  the  COVID-19  Economic \nRelief  Plan, 4 a  comprehensive  socioeconomic  assistance  program. 5 The  construction  of  the \nelectricity distribution system that enables reliable and sustainable electricity supply, is important \nto create employment and support the country\u2019s post-COVID-19 economic recovery. Myanmar\u2019s \neconomy is projected to recover to 6.0% growth in 2021 and continue to grow in the future. To \nsupport  long-term  sustainable  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic  development,  reliable  and \naffordable electricity supply is essential.  \n \n4. \nEnergy  sector  constraints  and  the  government\u2019s  response.  The  Myanmar \nSustainable  Development  Plan  2018\u20132030  prioritizes  (i)  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  to \nsupport  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  (ii)  universal  electricity  access  by \n2030.6 To realize these goals, Myanmar needs to overcome the energy sector\u2019s core development \n\n \n\n1  ADB provided a technical assistance to  prepare the project.

Nay Pyi Taw. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nproblems:  the  current  inadequate  power  generation  capacity,  and  insufficient  and  obsolete \ntransmission  and  distribution  infrastructure.  In  response,  the  government  has  advanced  policy \nand  institutional  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  investment  in,  and  operation  and \nmanagement of, the energy sector; and has mobilized resources to (i) construct new power plants \nto  increase  generating  capacity;  (ii)  expand  the  transmission  network  to  remove  transmission \nconstraints;  and  (iii)  expand  distribution  systems  to  connect  more  consumers  to  the  electricity \ngrid, particularly in underserved rural areas. \n \nPolicy and institutional reforms. Since 2013, the government has implemented several \n5. \npolicy and institutional reforms, including the adoption of the National Energy Policy in 2013 and \nthe National Electrification Plan in 2014, the finalization of the National Electricity Master Plan in \n2017, 7 and  the  preparation  of  rules  and  regulations  for  off-grid  electrification.  These  reforms \nsupport  establishing  a  transparent  mechanism  for  setting  and  implementing  cost-reflective \nelectricity tariffs,  developing  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) mechanism  to mobilize  private \ninvestment, and corporatizing electricity supply entities to increase efficiency.  \n \nInvestment requirement.   The electrification rate rose from 33% in 2015 to 50% in 2019. \n6. \nAnnual electricity consumption grew 10%\u201312% from 2015 to 2019,8 and demand is projected to \nreach  60\u221280  terawatt-hours  by  2030.  To  meet  this  demand  and  achieve  the  goal  of  universal \nelectrification by 2030, the National Electricity Master Plan projects that about $37 billion will be \nneeded for investment in power generation ($20 billion), the transmission network ($7 billion), and \nthe  distribution  system  ($10 billion).  To  enable  open  access  to  generation  sources,  the \ngovernment is developing the transmission and distribution network through public funding while \nscaling  up  private  sector  financing  for  power  generation. Independent  power  producers  (IPPs) \ngenerated  40%  of  electricity  in  2018  and  the  share  continues  to  increase.  About  half  of  the \nplanned new capacity (18 gigawatt; $10 billion) to meet the projected demand by 2030 is expected \nfrom IPPs. Between 2018 and 2020, the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE) issued notices \nto proceed to IPPs totaling more than 6.3 gigawatt, including 1.1 gigawatt of solar capacity.  \n\n \n\n7. \nADB\u2019s holistic support. ADB has supported the government in both policy reforms and \ninfrastructure  development since  2012  including: (i)  $440.0 million  of sovereign  lending for the \ndevelopment  of  transmission  and  distribution  networks; 9  (ii)  $152.2  million  of  nonsovereign \ninvestment  and  political  risk  guarantee  for  a  high-efficiency  gas-fired  power  plant  to  boost \ngeneration capacity;10 and (iii) $4.7 million in TAs for the Myanmar Energy Master Plan (2013), \nElectricity Law (2014), draft renewable energy and energy efficiency policies, regional grid code \nharmonization  and  cross-border  power  trade  opportunities,  and  PPP  advisory  for  the \ncorporatization  of  distribution  entities  and  renewable  energy  development.11 Experience  from \nADB\u2019s previously financed projects show that implementation delays can be mitigated by (i) a high \ndegree  of  project  readiness,  (ii)  advance  procurement  action,  and  (iii)  close  implementation \nsupport. ADB will apply these lessons to the project. \n \n\n \n\n7  Government  of  Myanmar,  Ministry  of  Electricity  and  Energy  (MOEE).  National  Energy  Policy.

In addition to the support received under the Power Network Development \nProject,  the  government  requested  ADB  to  further  support  the  expansion  of  power  distribution \nnetworks in Ayeyarwady, Bago (East), and Magway regions; and Kayin State.14 These areas have \nhigher poverty and lower electrification rates than the national average. For example, the poverty \nrates are 31.7% in Ayeyarwady and 35.6% in Magway, while electrification rates are 17.2% in \nAyeyarwady and 28.1% in Magway.15 The project is expected to electrify an additional 400,300 \nhouseholds  in  2,815  villages.16 Thousands  of  schools,  clinics,  hospitals,  and  libraries  are  also \nexpected to gain access to grid electricity. This will help these regions cope with and recover from \nthe impacts of COVID-19 as migrant workers have returned to rural areas from cities and abroad.  \n\n \n\n12 Government  of  Myanmar,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Finance.  2018.

Myanmar is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate \n11. \nchange because of its geography. It was ranked the second most impacted economy in the world \nby  extreme  weather  events  during  1999\u20132018. 17  The  project  design  integrates  resilience \nmeasures  that  make  Myanmar\u2019s  power  distribution  system  resilient  to  climate  risks  to  provide \nreliable electricity to rural vulnerable communities. As stated in its Intended Nationally Determined \nContributions,  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  measures  were  integrated  as  priorities  in  the \nNational  Adaptation  Programme  of  Action  (NAPA)  2012.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the \nimplementation of NAPA in energy and industry, one of the NAPA\u2019s four priority sectors.18 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: (i) reliable and affordable electricity supply \nprovided  to  support  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  (ii)  universal \nelectricity  access  achieved  (footnotes  6  and  7).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \ncapacity, regional coverage, and operational efficiency of power distribution system in Myanmar \nincreased. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  New  distribution  facilities  added  to  the  distribution  systems  in \nAyeyarwady,  Bago  (East),  and  Magway  regions;  and  Kayin  State.  This  will  be  delivered \nthrough the construction and commissioning of 44 distribution substations (18 in Ayeyarwady, 8 in \nBago [East], 12 in Magway, and 6 in Kayin); and about 1,006 km of distribution lines (232 km in \nAyeyarwady, 221 km in Bago [East], 315 km in Magway, and 238 km in Kayin).  \n \n14. \nOutput 2: New computerized distribution automation system established and pilot \ntested.  This  includes  the  design,  installation,  and  operation  of  a  pilot  DAS  in  each  of  the  four \nproject regions and state and Nay Pyi Taw; and the training of Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE) \nengineers in DAS operations. The DAS will optimize the power distribution operation through real-\ntime  monitoring,  minimization  of  network  faults,  and  fast  detection  of  faults  and  restoration  of \npower supply. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Social  and  gender-inclusive  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Electricity  and \nEnergy, Electricity Supply Enterprise, and village electrification committees in the project \nareas  enhanced.  This  will  be  delivered  through  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  and  the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  gender  equity  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  road  map  for \nrural electrification, which the ESE will apply in the electrified rural areas. The GESI road map will \ninclude  policies  and  actions  for  the  ESE  to  mobilize  gender-balanced  village  electrification \ncommittees  (VECs)  in  (i)  optimizing  the  demand  for,  and  affordability  of,  connections  for  all \nhouseholds, and (ii) raising awareness on safe and efficient use of electricity for time saving and \nlivelihoods among women in newly electrified areas.  \n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe proposed project adds value by helping the government achieve inclusive growth. It \nwill  support  the  Ayeyarwady  region,  the  most  populous  region  with  one-fifth  of  Myanmar\u2019s \npopulation but one of the lowest electricity access rates, through 18 out of 44 new substations.

The project has developed a GAP \nthat  will  integrate  gender  mainstreaming  measures  across  all  project  outputs.  In  addition,  the \nproject  will  develop  a  GESI  road  map  to  be  adopted  and  applied  by  the  ESE  across  its  rural \nelectrification program. The TA will help implement measures devised by the GESI road map to \npromote  women\u2019s  participation  in  VECs,  by  organizing  information  and  training  sessions  for \nwomen on village and household connections and electrical safety. The TA will support the ESE \nto promote efficient electricity-based livelihood and time-saving options among women, including \nethnic minority women. It will also support the ESE to work with VECs to develop viable options \nto increase connection rates among poor and vulnerable households. The TA is estimated to cost \n$1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office \nspace,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance, \nfacilities,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nlocal  communication \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nTechnical  due  diligence  has  ensured  that  the  capacity  and  type  of  substations  are \nappropriate,  and  the  distance  between  existing  and  new  substations  are  optimal  to  minimize \nvoltage drops along the lines. The DAS configuration will have immediate benefits for the small \nnumber of feeders selected for it, and the ESE will subsequently be able to replicate it throughout \nits network. The project was screened for climate and geophysical hazards and was classified \nmedium  risk.  The  preliminary  design  is  in  line  with  national  seismic  design  standards  and \nintegrates climate and disaster resilience measures to reduce vulnerability to the risks of extreme \nclimate events and geophysical hazards.24 \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  assessment  followed  ADB\u2019s \n25. \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects by comparing the societal costs and benefits of \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \n\n23 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 These  measures  include  ensuring  that substations  and  distribution  tower  and  pole  footings  are  raised above  the \nhighest flood level; paving and raising the embankment height of access roads; maintaining natural land drainage; \navoiding landslide-prone areas; and including specifications for effective cooling for substations and transformers \nand resilient high-capacity overhead distribution towers and poles. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nthe  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.25 The  project\u2019s  quantifiable  benefits  include  increased \nelectricity supply with higher reliability and electrification of 400,300 households and more than \n2,815  public  buildings  (schools,  clinics,  and  village  offices)  for  the  regions  covered  under  the \nproject.  At  the  beginning  of  project  operations,  their  consumption  of  grid  electricity  will  reach \n310 GWh, increasing to full utilization of substation capacity. The economic internal rate of return \nfor the project is 10.6%. A sensitivity analysis confirms the project\u2019s economic viability with respect \nto important project variables.26 \n \nFinancial analysis. The financial evaluation of the project followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \n26. \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.27 The analysis examined the financial viability of \nthe  proposed  expansion  of  the  distribution  network  owned  and  operated  by  the  ESE.  It  was \nperformed by comparing the future incremental benefits accrued from additional electricity sales \nand  the  incremental  costs  to  the  ESE.  The  post-tax  real  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  the \nproject is estimated at 1.9%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 0.9%.28 \n \n27. \nThe ESE\u2019s profitability fell from net profit before tax of MK18.3 billion in FY2015 to a net \nloss of MK2.5 billion in FY2018 because of the growing inadequacy of the gross tariff margin set \nby the government. Tariffs increased by an average of 48% in July 2019, but the rate at which the \nESE  buys  electricity  increased  by  57%, resulting  in  a MK1  per  kilowatt-hour (kWh)  gross  tariff \nmargin. Since the ESE\u2019s operational and administrative expenses are MK5/kWh, and depreciation \nis MK3/kWh, its cash and accounting losses will increase significantly from the current financial \nyear. Recognizing this situation, the MOEE proposed to the Parliament to implement regular tariff \nadjustments  from  2022,  and  is  working  to  establish  a  mechanism  for  cost-reflective  tariff \nadjustment  which  will  allow  the  ESE  to  cover  its  investment,  operation,  and  maintenance \nexpenditure and return the ESE to profitability. In the meantime, the government is allocating an \nannual budget to ensure that the ESE can meet its financial and operational obligations.29  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe medium voltage facilities built under the project will be an integral part of the country\u2019s \nlong-term power systems. The ESE has sufficient staff and expertise to operate and maintain the \nproject facilities in the long term. The PIC will help ensure that contracts are awarded to qualified \nbidders  and  that  the  construction  complies  with  approved  technical  specifications.  Regular \nmonitoring  will  ensure  that  the  technical  design  and  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements are fully implemented. The TA and GAP will involve and empower women from the \nESE and at the grassroots level in utilizing the benefits brought about by the project. The project\u2019s \nsustainability is embedded in its design and implementation. \n \nD. \n \nThe MOEE is fully responsible for policy  decision-making and the implementation of all \n29. \nenergy-related  businesses  in  Myanmar.  For  the  energy  sector,  the  MOEE  develops  long-  and \nmedium-term development plans and mobilizes resources to implement the plans. The MOEE is \nresponsible for implementing the national electrification targets. It prepares electricity tariff reform \nmeasures and requests parliamentary approval for those measures.

To mitigate these risks, the project includes the \nfollowing measures: (i) budget support to the ESE will be closely monitored and agreed with the \ngovernment  to  ensure  the  ESE\u2019s  financial  sustainability;  (ii)  an  entity-wide  road  map  will  be \ndeveloped for the management information system; and (iii) support will be provided to the Office \nof the Auditor General to upgrade Myanmar\u2019s accounting and auditing standards and to address \nthe Office of the Auditor General\u2019s capacity building needs. \n \n31. \nStrategic  procurement  planning  was  carried  out  by  ADB  to  ensure  that  fit-for-purpose \nprocurement  approaches  are  developed  to  maximize  value  for  money  by  (i)  using  open \ncompetitive  bidding  methods  for  all  procurement;  (ii)  utilizing  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction contracts for more complex substation packages to increase international bidders\u2019 \ninterest and safeguard quality; (iii) maximizing opportunities for local suppliers and contractors on \nthe less complex and geographically dispersed distribution line packages, based on local capacity \nand experience with previous similar projects; and (iv) engaging the PIC, via advance action, to \nsupport the executing agency in all subsequent procurement activities. \n \n32. \nThe government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nMyanmar\u2019s Anticorruption Law was promulgated in July 2013. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOEE. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 20). ADB has provided and will continue to provide training for the MOEE and ESE staff \non ADB guidelines and procedures for procurement, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and the \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nBy supporting the government to provide grid electricity to 400,300 households and more \nthan  2,815  public  buildings  (schools,  clinics,  religious  buildings,  and  hospitals),  the  project  will \ncontribute to Myanmar reaching the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of affordable, reliable, \nand sustainable energy for all by 2030 (SDG 7), while contributing to ending poverty (SDG 1) and \npromoting gender equality (SDG 5). All communities and groups\u2014including rural women, men, \nelderly  people,  boys  and  girls,  businesses,  and  public  institutions\u2014in  the  poor  rural  areas  of \nAyeyarwady, Bago (East), and Magway regions and Kayin State will benefit equitably from the \navailability of reliable electricity. The electrification of public facilities will increase access to better \nhealth care and education outcomes, improving the development of communities in the project \nareas.  The  increase  in  access  to  time-saving  energy-based  equipment  for  domestic  and \nproductive  tasks  will  reduce  women\u2019s  time  poverty.  Electrification  will  also  create  more \nopportunities for small and medium-sized enterprise development.  \n \n34. \nThe  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  has  developed  a  GAP  that \nintegrates measures across all project outputs. The GAP\u2019s actions include (i) training ESE staff \nand  management  on  integrating  gender-responsive  recruitment  and  employment  promotion \nmeasures into ESE human resource policies and practices; (ii) leadership training for women to \naccess  management  positions;  and  (iii)  nontraditional  technical  occupations  such  as  the  DAS. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nSafeguards \n\nAttached TA (para. 23) will support the ESE to promote efficient electricity-based livelihood and \ntime-saving options among women. It will also support the ESE to work with VECs to develop \nviable  options  to  increase  connection  rates  among  poor  and  vulnerable  households.  During \nconstruction, contractors will be required to conduct awareness campaigns to mitigate any risks \nrelated to HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and COVID-19.30  \n \n35. \nThe MOEE prepared an SCS that aims to build trust and productive relationships between \naffected  communities  and  the  ESE,  and  promote  greater  transparency,  responsiveness,  and \naccountability  of  project  management.  Key  SCS  elements  include  (i)  timely  dissemination  of \nrelevant  and  user-friendly  project  information,  including  a  project  information  booklet,  through \nappropriate communication channels; (ii) facilitating meaningful two-way consultations, based on \nthe prior disclosure of information; (iii) building the capacity of the ESE to engage effectively with \ndifferent  groups  of  stakeholders;  (iv)  expanding  outreach  to  vulnerable  groups,  including \nhouseholds headed by women, and amplifying their voices through collaboration and partnership \nwith  civil  society  organizations;  and  (v)  establishing  and  maintaining  a  functional  grievance \nredress  mechanism  (GRM).  The  SCS  envisages  systematic  collaboration  and  communication \namong  environmental,  social,  and  gender  staff  within  the  PMU  and  PIUs;  and  serves  as  an \nimplementing  platform  for  the  resettlement  and  ethnic  group  development  plan  (REGDP), \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), and GAP.  \n \nF. \n \n36. \nThe ESE, in collaboration with ADB, has prepared project safeguard documents following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).31 These include \nan  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  a  combined  involuntary  resettlement  plan  and \nindigenous  development  plan  (the  REGDP). 32  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.33 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  draft  IEE  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  Public \n37. \nconsultations  to  inform  the  project  affected  communities  about  the  project  design  and  the \nenvironmental assessment process have begun and will continue during project implementation. \nThe  project  GRM  will  handle  environmental  complaints  and  grievances.  All  the  proposed \nsubprojects  are  in  modified  habitats.  No  protected  areas  or  other  sensitive  environmental \nreceptors  have  been  identified  in the  project area  of  influence.  The  identified  impacts  are  site-\nspecific and can be reduced to an acceptable level through mitigation measures. These impacts \nwill  primarily  occur  during  construction,  e.g.,  vegetation  clearance,  some  earthworks  and  site \nleveling,  dust,  noise,  vibration,  disposal  of  construction  debris  and/or  spoils,  occupational  and \ncommunity health and safety hazards, increased traffic, and disruption because of power outages \n(e.g.,  when  constructing  towers  and/or  poles  and  stringing  conductors).  The  EMP  includes \nmitigation measures during construction and operation and identifies the responsible parties for \nEMP implementation and an implementation and monitoring budget. The ESE will update the IEE \nand EMP which will be cleared by ADB before civil works start.    \n \n38. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category B). Based \non  the  feasibility  design,  the  social  safeguard  impacts  and  risks  were  identified.

Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\ninclude  permanent  acquisition  of  land  for  substations  and  temporary  impacts  on  land  for  the \ndistribution lines (e.g., right-of-way and temporary damage of crops during stringing of towers and \npoles). The REGDP was prepared to address the identified permanent and temporary impacts on \nland and indigenous peoples and to ensure that the project will not cause any severe impacts or \nloss of livelihoods.  \n \n39. \nFor  substations,  the  required  land  will  be  permanently  procured  through  a  negotiated \nsettlement mechanism (willing buyer willing seller procedures) with clear criteria and requirements \ndescribed in the REGDP, which include records of meaningful consultation with affected people \nand third-party verification. About 37.35 hectares are needed for the substations\u201421.06 hectares \nof private land, 9.30 hectares owned by the ESE or regional departments, and 6.99 hectares of \ncommunity land owned by village communities or Buddhist monastery. The land acquisition for \nsubstations will not involve any physical displacement of people. If the negotiated settlement for \nland for any substation fails, the ESE has agreed to find alternative suitable land. \n \n40. \nThe  distribution  lines  will  temporarily  use  2,247.94  hectares  for  the  right-of-way  (27% \ngovernment  land  and  73%  private  land).  The  temporary  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minimal \nbecause of the wide use of road easements, the short construction period, and construction during \nthe dry season when most of the farmland lies fallow. All the affected households are entitled to \ncompensation at full replacement cost for their loss of non-land assets such as trees, perennial \nand small crops, or any other standing properties within the proposed right-of-way of distribution \nline alignment as described in the entitlement matrix. The REGDP specifies the implementation \narrangements, entitlement matrix, monitoring requirements, meaningful consultation (particularly \nwith ethnic groups), and the GRM. The compensation budget is included in the project costs to \nbe financed by the MOEE. The ESE will update the REGDP based on the detailed engineering \ndesign and obtain ADB approval before any physical or economic displacement takes place. \n \n41. \nThe  project  area  is  inhabited  by  various  ethnic  groups.  However,  the  project  will  not  (i) \nacquire lands that are traditionally used by ethnic groups; (ii) cause any adverse impacts on the \nidentity, society, culture, and areas of spiritual importance of ethnic groups; or (iii) interfere with \ntheir sociocultural beliefs and livelihood systems. Ethnic group communities will benefit equally \nfrom  the  project  through  job  opportunities  and  household  electrification.  During  the  project \nimplementation  the  project  implementation  units  will  conduct  meaningful  consultation  and \nassessment of the socioeconomic situation of ethnic groups.  Any loss of crops or trees because \nof  distribution  lines  will  be  assessed  and  compensated  following  the  entitlement  matrix  in  the \nREGDP. The REGDP also includes measures to ensure that the concerns of ethnic groups are \naddressed accordingly. The ESE has consulted the ethnic groups adequately and will address \ntheir concerns during the REGDP implementation. The ESE will recruit a PIC with international \nand national safeguard specialists to assist the PMU and the PIUs in implementing the EMP and \nthe  REGDP.

Advance contracting is applied \nfor the recruitment of the project implementation consultant. Consultants \nrecruited under the transaction TA for project preparation have prepared all \nbidding documents and taken advance procurement action as necessary. \nADB and other development partners are working closely with the government \n(the MIFER, MOPFI, FERD, and DACU) to prioritize investment needs and \nhelp the government mobilize financing, including multilateral, bilateral, and \nprivate financing. ADB is supporting the MOEE in applying a framework for \nPPP in generation investment and in corporatizing distribution companies to \nmake them more attractive to investors. \nADB and the World Bank are supporting the MOEE in establishing and \nimplementing tariffs based on full cost recovery principles. The World Bank is \nproviding TA to support the preparation of a financial sustainability study and \nmethodology for electricity tariffs. The MOEE has requested parliamentary \napproval of the next electricity tariff increases to be implemented starting in \n2022 to return the ESE to profitability. \nTo help ESE improve its financial management, the project includes the \nfollowing measures: (i) budget support to the ESE will be closely monitored \nand agreed with the government to ensure the ESE\u2019s financial sustainability; \n(ii) an entity-wide road map will be developed for the management information \nsystem; and (iii) support will be provided to the Office of the Auditor General to \nupgrade Myanmar\u2019s accounting and auditing standards and to address the \nOffice of the Auditor General\u2019s capacity building needs \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  DACU  =  Development  Assistance  Coordination  Unit;  ESE  =  Electricity  Supply \nEnterprise; FERD = Foreign Economic Relations Department; MIFER = Ministry of Investment and Foreign Economic \nRelations;  MOEE = Ministry of Electricity and Energy; MOPFI = Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry; PPP = public\u2013\nprivate partnership; TA = technical assistance.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n43. \nThe  government  and  the  MOEE  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
