THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Accelerated Rural Electrification Project. The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Enhancing Gender Equality and Social \nInclusion in Rural Electrification, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n   \n2.  The project will construct 44 substations and about 1,006 kilometers (km) of 66 kV and 33 \nkV distribution lines in Ayeyarwady, Bago (East), and Magway regions; and Kayin State in \nMyanmar. The project will establish, for the first time in Myanmar, a computerized distribution \nautomation  system  (DAS)  to  improve  the  operational  efficiency  and  management  of  the \ndistribution systems.1 The project will enable the government to electrify an additional 400,300 \nhouseholds in 2,815 villages, contributing to the achievement of the country\u2019s plan of universal \nelectricity access by 2030. The project aims to support Myanmar\u2019s inclusive growth by expanding \nelectricity access in rural areas; and improve the project regions\u2019 response to the impacts of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic through better access to information, education, and \nwork opportunities. The TA will support the empowerment of women in villages for the safe and \nproductive use of electricity in the project areas.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Myanmar sustained strong growth averaging 6.4% in 2015\u2013\n2019, buoyed by the boom in manufacturing, construction, tourism, and services and increased \nforeign investment. The poverty rate decreased from 42.4% in 2010 to 28.4% in 2017. 2 However, \nthe COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undermine the strong progress, and the growth rate for \n2020 has been revised downward from 6.8% to 1.8%.3 To mitigate the adverse social and \neconomic impacts of the pandemic, the government is implementing the COVID-19 Economic \nRelief Plan,4 a comprehensive socioeconomic assistance program.5 The construction of the \nelectricity distribution system that enables reliable and sustainable electricity supply, is important \nto create employment and support the country\u2019s post-COVID-19 economic recovery. Myanmar\u2019s \neconomy is projected to recover to 6.0% growth in 2021 and continue to grow in the future. To \nsupport long-term sustainable economic growth and socioeconomic development, reliable and \naffordable electricity supply is essential.  \n \n4.  Energy  sector  constraints  and  the  government\u2019s  response.  The  Myanmar \nSustainable Development Plan 2018\u20132030 prioritizes (i) reliable and affordable electricity to \nsupport economic development and poverty reduction, and (ii) universal electricity access by \n2030.6 To realize these goals, Myanmar needs to overcome the energy sector\u2019s core development \n \n1  ADB provided a technical assistance to prepare the project.

Nay Pyi Taw. \n \n ", "2 \n \nproblems: the  current  inadequate  power  generation  capacity,  and  insufficient  and  obsolete \ntransmission and distribution infrastructure. In response, the government has advanced policy \nand  institutional  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  investment  in,  and  operation  and \nmanagement of, the energy sector; and has mobilized resources to (i) construct new power plants \nto increase generating capacity; (ii) expand the transmission network to remove transmission \nconstraints; and (iii) expand distribution systems to connect more consumers to the electricity \ngrid, particularly in underserved rural areas. \n \n5.  Policy and institutional reforms. Since 2013, the government has implemented several \npolicy and institutional reforms, including the adoption of the National Energy Policy in 2013 and \nthe National Electrification Plan in 2014, the finalization of the National Electricity Master Plan in \n2017, 7 and the preparation of rules and regulations for off-grid electrification. These reforms \nsupport  establishing  a  transparent  mechanism  for  setting  and  implementing  cost-reflective \nelectricity tariffs, developing a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) mechanism to mobilize private \ninvestment, and corporatizing electricity supply entities to increase efficiency.  \n \n6.  Investment requirement.   The electrification rate rose from 33% in 2015 to 50% in 2019. \nAnnual electricity consumption grew 10%\u201312% from 2015 to 2019,8 and demand is projected to \nreach 60\u221280 terawatt-hours by 2030. To meet this demand and achieve the goal of universal \nelectrification by 2030, the National Electricity Master Plan projects that about $37 billion will be \nneeded for investment in power generation ($20 billion), the transmission network ($7 billion), and \nthe  distribution  system  ($10 billion).  To  enable  open  access  to  generation  sources,  the \ngovernment is developing the transmission and distribution network through public funding while \nscaling up private sector financing for power generation. Independent power producers (IPPs) \ngenerated 40% of electricity in 2018 and the share continues to increase. About half of the \nplanned new capacity (18 gigawatt; $10 billion) to meet the projected demand by 2030 is expected \nfrom IPPs. Between 2018 and 2020, the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE) issued notices \nto proceed to IPPs totaling more than 6.3 gigawatt, including 1.1 gigawatt of solar capacity.  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s holistic support. ADB has supported the government in both policy reforms and \ninfrastructure development since 2012 including: (i) $440.0 million of sovereign lending for the \ndevelopment of transmission and distribution  networks;9 (ii) $152.2 million of  nonsovereign \ninvestment and political risk guarantee for a high-efficiency gas-fired power plant to boost \ngeneration capacity;10 and (iii) $4.7 million in TAs for the Myanmar Energy Master Plan (2013), \nElectricity Law (2014), draft renewable energy and energy efficiency policies, regional grid code \nharmonization  and  cross-border  power  trade  opportunities,  and  PPP  advisory  for  the \ncorporatization of distribution entities and renewable energy development.11 Experience from \nADB\u2019s previously financed projects show that implementation delays can be mitigated by (i) a high \ndegree of project readiness, (ii) advance procurement action, and (iii) close implementation \nsupport. ADB will apply these lessons to the project. \n \n \n7 Government  of  Myanmar,  Ministry  of  Electricity  and  Energy  (MOEE).  National  Energy  Policy.

ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the \nWorld Bank, and other development partners are closely coordinating on assistance for the \nenergy sector in Myanmar through the Power Sector Coordination Group. Guided by the Myanmar \nDevelopment  Assistance  Policy,  the  coordination  group  discusses  and  prioritizes  areas for \nassistance, reviews implementation challenges, and proposes actions to ensure efficient use of \ninternational assistance for the sector.12 ADB focuses on strengthening the 230 kV transmission \nsystem  and the  66 kV  and  33  kV  distribution  systems,  developing  solar-  and  wind-based \nrenewable energies to power, and improving the framework for PPP. JICA finances the 500 kV \nbackbone transmission network and the gas-based generation capacities. The World Bank \nsupports off-grid rural electrification, rehabilitation of generation capacities, and tariff reform. \n \n9.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1) and the country partnership \nstrategy, 2017\u20132021 for Myanmar.13 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Contributions \nAddressing remaining poverty  The project will provide electricity access to 400,300 households in rural areas, \nand reducing inequalities  thereby ensuring reliable and affordable electricity to support economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction.  \nAccelerating progress in gender  The project will build the capacity of the Electricity Supply Enterprise, the \nequality  implementing agency, to empower women in the rural electrification program at \nthe corporate and village levels. \nTackling climate change,  The project will (i) improve operational efficiency and reduce electricity losses, \nbuilding climate and disaster  thus effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions; (ii) integrate climate and \nresilience, and enhancing  disaster resilience measures in the preliminary design; and (iii) enhance the \nenvironmental sustainability  automation of distribution systems, which will allow faster damage detection \nand service recovery after extreme climate events. \nPromoting rural development  The project will target states and regions with high rural populations and \nand food security  electrification rates below the country\u2019s already low average, to help the \ngovernment achieve its national goal of universal electrification by 2030.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.  Project focus. In addition to the support received under the Power Network Development \nProject, the government requested ADB to further support the expansion of power distribution \nnetworks in Ayeyarwady, Bago (East), and Magway regions; and Kayin State.14 These areas have \nhigher poverty and lower electrification rates than the national average. For example, the poverty \nrates are 31.7% in Ayeyarwady and 35.6% in Magway, while electrification rates are 17.2% in \nAyeyarwady and 28.1% in Magway.15 The project is expected to electrify an additional 400,300 \nhouseholds in 2,815 villages.16 Thousands of schools, clinics, hospitals, and libraries are also \nexpected to gain access to grid electricity. This will help these regions cope with and recover from \nthe impacts of COVID-19 as migrant workers have returned to rural areas from cities and abroad.  \n \n12 Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Planning and Finance. 2018.

Vulnerability to climate change. Myanmar is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate \nchange because of its geography. It was ranked the second most impacted economy in the world \nby  extreme  weather  events  during  1999\u20132018.17 The  project  design  integrates  resilience \nmeasures that make Myanmar\u2019s power distribution system resilient to climate risks to provide \nreliable electricity to rural vulnerable communities. As stated in its Intended Nationally Determined \nContributions, climate mitigation and adaptation measures were integrated as priorities in the \nNational  Adaptation  Programme  of  Action  (NAPA)  2012.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the \nimplementation of NAPA in energy and industry, one of the NAPA\u2019s four priority sectors.18 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: (i) reliable and affordable electricity supply \nprovided  to  support  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  (ii)  universal \nelectricity access achieved (footnotes 6 and 7). The project will have the following outcome: \ncapacity, regional coverage, and operational efficiency of power distribution system in Myanmar \nincreased. \n \n13.  Output  1:  New  distribution  facilities  added  to  the  distribution  systems  in \nAyeyarwady, Bago (East), and Magway regions; and Kayin State. This will be delivered \nthrough the construction and commissioning of 44 distribution substations (18 in Ayeyarwady, 8 in \nBago [East], 12 in Magway, and 6 in Kayin); and about 1,006 km of distribution lines (232 km in \nAyeyarwady, 221 km in Bago [East], 315 km in Magway, and 238 km in Kayin).  \n \n14.  Output 2: New computerized distribution automation system established and pilot \ntested. This includes the design, installation, and operation of a pilot DAS in each of the four \nproject regions and state and Nay Pyi Taw; and the training of Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE) \nengineers in DAS operations. The DAS will optimize the power distribution operation through real-\ntime monitoring, minimization of network faults, and fast detection of faults and restoration of \npower supply. \n \n15.  Output 3: Social and gender-inclusive capacity of the Ministry of Electricity and \nEnergy, Electricity Supply Enterprise, and village electrification committees in the project \nareas  enhanced.  This  will  be  delivered  through  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  and  the \ndevelopment and implementation of a gender equity and social inclusion (GESI) road map for \nrural electrification, which the ESE will apply in the electrified rural areas. The GESI road map will \ninclude policies and actions for the ESE to mobilize gender-balanced village electrification \ncommittees (VECs) in (i) optimizing the demand for, and affordability of, connections for all \nhouseholds, and (ii) raising awareness on safe and efficient use of electricity for time saving and \nlivelihoods among women in newly electrified areas.  \n \nC.  Value added by ADB  \n \n16.  The proposed project adds value by helping the government achieve inclusive growth. It \nwill support the Ayeyarwady region, the most populous region with one-fifth of Myanmar\u2019s \npopulation but one of the lowest electricity access rates, through 18 out of 44 new substations. It \nwill introduce new technology (the DAS), which will integrate a database for automating the \nscheduling and contracting of maintenance works for the electricity distribution facilities.

Conflict-sensitive approach. The project design includes measures to ensure that \nproject-affected  people  are  properly  informed  of  and  involved  in  project  decision-making, \nparticularly regarding compensation for adverse impacts; and have opportunities to benefit from \nthe project. Such measures are detailed in a stakeholder communication strategy SCS) and a \nresettlement and ethnic group development plan (REGDP). The implementation of the conflict-\nsensitive measures will be closely monitored by ADB in all project areas including Kayin State, \nwhich may be considered conflict affected. \n \nBox: Noteworthy Features of the Project \n\u2022 The project will enable electrifying the poor and populous rural areas (e.g., Ayeyarwady) which have high \npotential economic growth once electrified, thus support poverty reduction and socioeconomic development.  \n\u2022 More women will participate in the village electrification committees and receive trainings on safe and productive \nuse of electricity. The project integrates gender mainstreaming measures across all project outputs.  \n\u2022 Distribution automation systems will be introduced to improve operational efficiency and service reliability \nthrough real-time monitoring and fast detection of faults and restoration of power supply. \n\u2022 The project is the third since 2015 to help expand the electricity grid and demonstrates ADB\u2019s growing \nengagement with the government to meet important gaps in infrastructure and institutional development. \n \n \nD.

Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $78.00 million and climate adaptation is estimated \nto cost $8.56 million. The project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the introduction of \nDAS to improve efficiency and the displacement of carbon-intensive fuels (e.g., kerosene and \ndiesel). ADB will finance 100% of mitigation and adaptation costs ($86.56 million). Details are in \nthe Climate Change Assessment.21 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The MOEE will be the executing agency. The ESE will be the implementing agency and \nwill set up a project management unit (PMU) at the ESE headquarters in Nay Pyi Taw and four \nproject implementation units (PIUs, one in each ESE regional or state office) to manage the day-\nto-day implementation.22 Procurement will be undertaken following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \n22.  The impact of COVID-19 is evolving, and the project will be responsive and flexible in \nmeeting emerging needs and new guidance. The project will strictly follow government guidance \non safe working in COVID-19 conditions, adhering to the most robust medical and scientific \nadvice. The project parties will be required to incorporate emerging international construction best \npractice on distancing (where practical for works of this nature), implementation methodologies, \neffective use of forced air ventilation systems, and personal protective equipment. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2021\u2013June 2027 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry \n(ii) Executing agency  MOEE \n(iii) Implementing agency  ESE  \n(iv) Implementation unit  PMU (ESE headquarters, Nay Pyi Taw) and PIUs (ESE offices in Ayeyarwady, Bago \n[East], Magway regions and Kayin State)  \n \n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) also shows the estimation \nof greenhouse gas reduction (25,762 tons of carbon dioxide per year). \n22 The Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE) is a unit under the MOEE operating with an annual government budget \nallocation.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE23 \n \n23.  Attached TA will support the implementation of output 3. The project has developed a GAP \nthat will integrate gender mainstreaming measures across all project outputs. In addition, the \nproject will develop a GESI road map to be adopted and applied by the ESE across its rural \nelectrification program. The TA will help implement measures devised by the GESI road map to \npromote women\u2019s participation in VECs, by organizing information and training sessions for \nwomen on village and household connections and electrical safety. The TA will support the ESE \nto promote efficient electricity-based livelihood and time-saving options among women, including \nethnic minority women. It will also support the ESE to work with VECs to develop viable options \nto increase connection rates among poor and vulnerable households. The TA is estimated to cost \n$1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office \nspace,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  local  communication  facilities,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  Technical due diligence has  ensured that the capacity and type of substations are \nappropriate, and the distance between existing and new substations are optimal to minimize \nvoltage drops along the lines. The DAS configuration will have immediate benefits for the small \nnumber of feeders selected for it, and the ESE will subsequently be able to replicate it throughout \nits network. The project was screened for climate and geophysical hazards and was classified \nmedium risk. The preliminary design is in line with national seismic design standards and \nintegrates climate and disaster resilience measures to reduce vulnerability to the risks of extreme \nclimate events and geophysical hazards.24 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  assessment  followed  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects by comparing the societal costs and benefits of \n \n23 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 These measures include ensuring that substations and distribution tower and pole footings are raised above the \nhighest flood level; paving and raising the embankment height of access roads; maintaining natural land drainage; \navoiding landslide-prone areas; and including specifications for effective cooling for substations and transformers \nand resilient high-capacity overhead distribution towers and poles. \n \n ", "8 \n \nthe with- and without-project scenarios.25 The project\u2019s quantifiable benefits include increased \nelectricity supply with higher reliability and electrification of 400,300 households and more than \n2,815 public buildings (schools, clinics, and village offices) for the regions covered under the \nproject. At the beginning of project operations, their consumption of grid electricity will reach \n310 GWh, increasing to full utilization of substation capacity. The economic internal rate of return \nfor the project is 10.6%. A sensitivity analysis confirms the project\u2019s economic viability with respect \nto important project variables.26 \n \n26.  Financial analysis. The financial evaluation of the project followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.27 The analysis examined the financial viability of \nthe proposed expansion of the distribution network owned and operated by the ESE. It was \nperformed by comparing the future incremental benefits accrued from additional electricity sales \nand the incremental costs to the ESE. The post-tax real financial internal rate of return of the \nproject is estimated at 1.9%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 0.9%.28 \n \n27.  The ESE\u2019s profitability fell from net profit before tax of MK18.3 billion in FY2015 to a net \nloss of MK2.5 billion in FY2018 because of the growing inadequacy of the gross tariff margin set \nby the government. Tariffs increased by an average of 48% in July 2019, but the rate at which the \nESE buys electricity increased by 57%, resulting in a MK1 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) gross tariff \nmargin. Since the ESE\u2019s operational and administrative expenses are MK5/kWh, and depreciation \nis MK3/kWh, its cash and accounting losses will increase significantly from the current financial \nyear. Recognizing this situation, the MOEE proposed to the Parliament to implement regular tariff \nadjustments  from  2022,  and  is  working  to  establish  a  mechanism  for  cost-reflective  tariff \nadjustment  which  will  allow  the  ESE  to  cover  its  investment,  operation,  and  maintenance \nexpenditure and return the ESE to profitability. In the meantime, the government is allocating an \nannual budget to ensure that the ESE can meet its financial and operational obligations.29  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  The medium voltage facilities built under the project will be an integral part of the country\u2019s \nlong-term power systems. The ESE has sufficient staff and expertise to operate and maintain the \nproject facilities in the long term. The PIC will help ensure that contracts are awarded to qualified \nbidders  and that  the construction  complies  with  approved technical  specifications.  Regular \nmonitoring  will  ensure  that  the  technical  design  and  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements are fully implemented. The TA and GAP will involve and empower women from the \nESE and at the grassroots level in utilizing the benefits brought about by the project. The project\u2019s \nsustainability is embedded in its design and implementation. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  The MOEE is fully responsible for policy decision-making and the implementation of all \nenergy-related businesses in Myanmar. For the energy sector, the MOEE develops long- and \nmedium-term development plans and mobilizes resources to implement the plans. The MOEE is \nresponsible for implementing the national electrification targets. It prepares electricity tariff reform \nmeasures and requests parliamentary approval for those measures. Under the MOEE, the ESE \n \n25 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n28 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Financial viability through cost reflective tariffs or budgetary allocation or other reform measures is included in the \nloan covenant.  \n \n ", " \n9 \nis responsible for the distribution business in Myanmar, except for Yangon and Mandalay cities. \nConsumer tariff and power supply cost to ESE are set by the MOEE.  \n  \n30.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial because of (i) the \nESE\u2019s dependence on the tariff margin, the difference between the ESE\u2019s electricity purchasing \nprice and the end-user tariff that the ESE receives by selling electricity, both set by the MOEE; (ii) \nlack of computerization across the ESE\u2019s finance and accounting functions; and (iii) weaknesses \nin internal financial management and reporting. To mitigate these risks, the project includes the \nfollowing measures: (i) budget support to the ESE will be closely monitored and agreed with the \ngovernment to ensure the ESE\u2019s financial sustainability; (ii) an entity-wide road map will be \ndeveloped for the management information system; and (iii) support will be provided to the Office \nof the Auditor General to upgrade Myanmar\u2019s accounting and auditing standards and to address \nthe Office of the Auditor General\u2019s capacity building needs. \n \n31.  Strategic procurement planning was carried out by ADB to ensure that fit-for-purpose \nprocurement  approaches  are  developed  to  maximize  value  for  money  by  (i)  using  open \ncompetitive bidding methods for all procurement; (ii) utilizing engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction contracts for more complex substation packages to increase international bidders\u2019 \ninterest and safeguard quality; (iii) maximizing opportunities for local suppliers and contractors on \nthe less complex and geographically dispersed distribution line packages, based on local capacity \nand experience with previous similar projects; and (iv) engaging the PIC, via advance action, to \nsupport the executing agency in all subsequent procurement activities. \n \n32.  The government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nMyanmar\u2019s Anticorruption Law was promulgated in July 2013. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOEE. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 20). ADB has provided and will continue to provide training for the MOEE and ESE staff \non ADB guidelines and procedures for procurement, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and the \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  By supporting the government to provide grid electricity to 400,300 households and more \nthan 2,815 public buildings (schools, clinics, religious buildings, and hospitals), the project will \ncontribute to Myanmar reaching the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of affordable, reliable, \nand sustainable energy for all by 2030 (SDG 7), while contributing to ending poverty (SDG 1) and \npromoting gender equality (SDG 5). All communities and groups\u2014including rural women, men, \nelderly people, boys and girls, businesses, and public institutions\u2014in the poor rural areas of \nAyeyarwady, Bago (East), and Magway regions and Kayin State will benefit equitably from the \navailability of reliable electricity. The electrification of public facilities will increase access to better \nhealth care and education outcomes, improving the development of communities in the project \nareas.  The  increase  in  access  to  time-saving  energy-based  equipment  for  domestic  and \nproductive  tasks  will  reduce  women\u2019s  time  poverty.  Electrification  will  also  create  more \nopportunities for small and medium-sized enterprise development.  \n \n34.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. It has developed a GAP that \nintegrates measures across all project outputs. The GAP\u2019s actions include (i) training ESE staff \nand  management  on  integrating  gender-responsive  recruitment  and  employment  promotion \nmeasures into ESE human resource policies and practices; (ii) leadership training for women to \naccess management positions; and (iii) nontraditional technical occupations such as the DAS. \n \n ", "10 \n \nAttached TA (para. 23) will support the ESE to promote efficient electricity-based livelihood and \ntime-saving options among women. It will also support the ESE to work with VECs to develop \nviable options to increase connection rates among poor and vulnerable households. During \nconstruction, contractors will be required to conduct awareness campaigns to mitigate any risks \nrelated to HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and COVID-19.30  \n \n35.  The MOEE prepared an SCS that aims to build trust and productive relationships between \naffected communities and the ESE, and promote greater transparency, responsiveness, and \naccountability of project management. Key SCS elements include (i) timely dissemination of \nrelevant and user-friendly project information, including a project information booklet, through \nappropriate communication channels; (ii) facilitating meaningful two-way consultations, based on \nthe prior disclosure of information; (iii) building the capacity of the ESE to engage effectively with \ndifferent  groups  of  stakeholders;  (iv)  expanding  outreach  to  vulnerable  groups,  including \nhouseholds headed by women, and amplifying their voices through collaboration and partnership \nwith civil society organizations; and (v) establishing and maintaining a functional grievance \nredress mechanism (GRM). The SCS envisages systematic collaboration and communication \namong environmental, social, and gender staff within the PMU and PIUs; and serves as an \nimplementing  platform  for  the  resettlement  and  ethnic  group  development  plan  (REGDP), \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), and GAP.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  The ESE, in collaboration with ADB, has prepared project safeguard documents following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).31 These include \nan initial environmental examination (IEE) and a combined involuntary resettlement plan and \nindigenous  development  plan  (the  REGDP).32 In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.33 \n \n37.  Environment (category B). The draft IEE was disclosed on the ADB website. Public \nconsultations to  inform the  project  affected  communities  about  the  project  design  and the \nenvironmental assessment process have begun and will continue during project implementation. \nThe  project  GRM  will  handle  environmental  complaints  and  grievances.  All  the  proposed \nsubprojects  are  in  modified  habitats.  No  protected  areas  or  other  sensitive  environmental \nreceptors have been identified in the project area of influence. The identified impacts are site-\nspecific and can be reduced to an acceptable level through mitigation measures. These impacts \nwill primarily occur during construction, e.g., vegetation clearance, some earthworks and site \nleveling, dust, noise, vibration, disposal of construction debris and/or spoils, occupational and \ncommunity health and safety hazards, increased traffic, and disruption because of power outages \n(e.g., when constructing towers and/or poles and stringing conductors). The EMP includes \nmitigation measures during construction and operation and identifies the responsible parties for \nEMP implementation and an implementation and monitoring budget. The ESE will update the IEE \nand EMP which will be cleared by ADB before civil works start.    \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category B). Based \non the feasibility design, the social safeguard impacts and risks were identified. The impacts \n \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 During the project preparation, 55 stakeholder consultations were held, involving 2,023 participants (1,498 men and \n525 women). \n32 Initial Environmental Examination and Resettlement and Ethnic Group Development Plan (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2), disclosed on ADB website on 10 October 2020. \n33 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", " \n11 \ninclude permanent acquisition of land for substations and temporary impacts on land for the \ndistribution lines (e.g., right-of-way and temporary damage of crops during stringing of towers and \npoles). The REGDP was prepared to address the identified permanent and temporary impacts on \nland and indigenous peoples and to ensure that the project will not cause any severe impacts or \nloss of livelihoods.  \n \n39.  For substations, the required land will be permanently procured through a negotiated \nsettlement mechanism (willing buyer willing seller procedures) with clear criteria and requirements \ndescribed in the REGDP, which include records of meaningful consultation with affected people \nand third-party verification. About 37.35 hectares are needed for the substations\u201421.06 hectares \nof private land, 9.30 hectares owned by the ESE or regional departments, and 6.99 hectares of \ncommunity land owned by village communities or Buddhist monastery. The land acquisition for \nsubstations will not involve any physical displacement of people. If the negotiated settlement for \nland for any substation fails, the ESE has agreed to find alternative suitable land. \n \n40.  The distribution lines will temporarily use 2,247.94 hectares for the right-of-way (27% \ngovernment land and 73% private land). The temporary impacts are expected to be minimal \nbecause of the wide use of road easements, the short construction period, and construction during \nthe dry season when most of the farmland lies fallow. All the affected households are entitled to \ncompensation at full replacement cost for their loss of non-land assets such as trees, perennial \nand small crops, or any other standing properties within the proposed right-of-way of distribution \nline alignment as described in the entitlement matrix. The REGDP specifies the implementation \narrangements, entitlement matrix, monitoring requirements, meaningful consultation (particularly \nwith ethnic groups), and the GRM. The compensation budget is included in the project costs to \nbe financed by the MOEE. The ESE will update the REGDP based on the detailed engineering \ndesign and obtain ADB approval before any physical or economic displacement takes place. \n \n41.  The project area is inhabited by various ethnic groups. However, the project will not (i) \nacquire lands that are traditionally used by ethnic groups; (ii) cause any adverse impacts on the \nidentity, society, culture, and areas of spiritual importance of ethnic groups; or (iii) interfere with \ntheir sociocultural beliefs and livelihood systems. Ethnic group communities will benefit equally \nfrom the project through job opportunities and household electrification.  During the project \nimplementation  the  project  implementation  units  will  conduct  meaningful  consultation  and \nassessment of the socioeconomic situation of ethnic groups.  Any loss of crops or trees because \nof distribution lines will be assessed and compensated following the entitlement matrix in the \nREGDP. The REGDP also includes measures to ensure that the concerns of ethnic groups are \naddressed accordingly. The ESE has consulted the ethnic groups adequately and will address \ntheir concerns during the REGDP implementation. The ESE will recruit a PIC with international \nand national safeguard specialists to assist the PMU and the PIUs in implementing the EMP and \nthe  REGDP.  The  project  implementation  costs  incorporate  the  estimated  budget  for  the \nimplementation of the safeguard mitigation plans.  \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n42.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \n \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "12 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe government\u2019s multilayer approval  ADB and other development partners are working with the government (DACU \nrequirements, which may delay the  and FERD) to streamline approval procedures.
