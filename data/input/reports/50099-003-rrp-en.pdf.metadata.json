It will finance (i) construction of sewerage networks and small-scale \nwastewater treatment plants (SWTPs) to improve sanitation, (ii) construction of controlled landfills \nand  solid  waste  collection  vehicles  to  improve  municipal  waste  collection  and  management, \n(iii) improvement  of  the  drainage  network  and  river  embankment  for  flood  protection, \n(iv) rehabilitation and conservation of the old town center at Thakhek to promote regional tourism, \nand (v) preparation of town master plans to promote regional economic connectivity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic context. The Lao PDR has a strong record of sustaining high economic \ngrowth. During 2011\u20132016, the average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was \n7.5%. In 2017, the country\u2019s GDP grew by 6.8%, increasing GDP per capita to $2,550.1 However, \nsignificant  development  challenges  remain,  including  (i)  a  high  fiscal  deficit,  (ii) accumulated \npublic and publicly guaranteed debt, (iii) an undiversified resource-based economy, and (iv) rapid \nurbanization  with  lagging  urban  services.  The  Lao  PDR\u2019s  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132020 recognizes the challenges and promotes sustainable small town \ndevelopment,  particularly  along  major \nimprove  economic \ntransport  corridors, \ncompetitiveness, reduce poverty, and improve the environment.2 \n \n4. \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  Central  Corridor.  The  Lao  PDR  is  among  the  fastest \nurbanizing countries in Southeast Asia. It had an urban population of about 2.14 million in 2015, \nup from 0.77 million in 1995, with an urban population growth rate of about 4.1% while overall \ncountry population has grown at an average of 1.5% annually over the same period.3 Growth in \nthe urban economy and increasing agglomeration of economic activities in and around cities are \nincreasing urbanization. The Lao PDR prioritizes the development of towns along the important \nGMS corridors, as it shares a border with all GMS countries. The GMS Central Corridor along the \nMekong River is the backbone of the country\u2014connecting Vientiane, the national capital, to the \nsecond  largest  economic  center  of  Pakxe  through  the  key  provincial  capitals  of  Kaysone \nPhomvihane,  Paksan,  and  Thakhek.  This  1,600 kilometer  (km)  corridor  from  the  Lao  PDR  to \nCambodia  crosses  13  towns,  with  about  20 million  people  along  the  corridor,  potentially \ngenerating more than $20 billion in regional economic output.4   \n \n5. \nTowns  along  the  central  corridor.  On  the  GMS  Central  Corridor,  the  provinces  of \nBolikhamxay and Khammouan exhibit potential for economic growth. However, the capitals of the \n\nto  help \n\n                                                \n1  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2016.  8th Five-Year National Socio-Economic \n\nDevelopment Plan (2016\u20132020). Vientiane. \n\n3  Lao Statistics Bureau. 2016. Results of Population and Housing Census 2015. Vientiane. \n4  The  corridor  population  comprises  the  people  living  50  km  on  either  side  of  the  Mekong  River.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) calculated the economic output based on the provincial GDP per capita multiplied by the \ncorridor population. \n\n \n\n\ftwo provinces, Paksan and Thakhek, are the least developed towns along the corridor, struggling \nto capture increasing regional trade and investment and creating incentives for local economies \nin their hinterlands.   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPaksan, the capital of Bolikhamxay Province, is located at the juncture of the San and \nMekong rivers. It is a small regional town with an urban population of about 26,000, \ngrowing at 2.5% annually. Paksan plays a key role as a logistics center for regional \nagricultural  exports.  In  2019,  the  construction  of  a  new  bridge  connecting  with \nBueng Kan in Thailand will commence with funding from the Government of Thailand \nunder the GMS initiative to improve regional linkages.  \nThakhek, the capital of Khammouan Province, has a population of about 90,500 and \nis growing at 2.3% annually. The most significant sectors in the town\u2019s economy are \ntourism, trade, transport, and government services. Tourism could be developed by \nstrengthening  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  and  around  the  town.  The  Third \nThai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge links with the province of Nakhon Phanom in Thailand. In \n2017, the bridge served 153,000 travelers to the Lao PDR, an increase of 41% from \n2013, while 495,000 Laotians crossed it to go to Thailand.5  The flow of tourism and \ntrade  into  Thakhek  provides  economic  opportunities  to  the  town,  but  increases \npressure on the already limited local infrastructure. \n\n \n6. \nAccess to services and key issues. The Lao PDR has focused its efforts on improving \ncommunity health and hygiene through awareness and provision of improved sanitation services. \nThis has resulted in a substantial improvement in the coverage of toilets and access to sanitation \nfacilities\u2014the coverage of improved sanitation facilities in urban areas rose to 94% in 2015 from \n86% in 2008. 6, 7 Improved sanitation is currently limited to connecting pour-flush toilets to soak \npits,  septic  tanks,  and  pit  latrines, 8  while  towns  need  improved  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment systems to control surface water and groundwater pollution. Although major towns have \na solid waste management (SWM) service, households and commercial and public buildings are \nnot  regularly  serviced  for  collection,  and  disposal  sites  are  typically  open  dump  sites  without \nappropriate  environmental  control  and  mitigation  measures. 9  Regarding  flood  control  and \ndrainage, towns along the Mekong River face increased land erosion and fluvial flooding, which \nis exacerbated by the impacts of climate change, resulting in widespread damage. \n \nPolicy framework. The institutional and governance systems to manage urban areas in \n7. \nthe Lao PDR are nascent. Various policies and legislation have been drafted to improve the urban \ngovernance and planning framework: the Sam Sang Policy, Local Administration Law 2015, and \ndraft  urban  sanitation  strategy.  These  aim  to  sharpen  the  government\u2019s  approach  toward \ndecentralization and the identification of municipal areas as development or management units. \nHowever,  institutionalizing  these  legislative  changes\u2014forming  institutions,  staffing  them,  and \nstabilizing their operations\u2014will take time before they start responding to urbanization challenges. \nThese delays are expected to affect infrastructure creation and service delivery, at least in the \nimmediate  term.  Municipal  entities  require  significant  capacity  development  and  regulatory \nmechanisms need to be set up to manage urban areas more effectively.  \n                                                \n5  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism. 2017.

Virachith \n\nDouangchanh. Vientiane. \n\n9  Open dump sites have little or no planning, management, record keeping, compaction, or covering of the solid waste. \nLiquid leachate pollutes surface water and groundwater, and landfill gas is released directly into the atmosphere. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fInstitutional  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT), \n8. \nthrough  the  provincial  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (DPWT),  is  responsible  for \nriverbank protection works including operation and maintenance (O&M). The Urban Development \nAdministration Authority (UDAA), under the provincial government, is responsible for wastewater \nand sanitation management, SWM, urban drainage, and urban renewal in the towns. The UDAA \nis also responsible for collecting fees for urban environmental services. \n \n9. \n\nProject-specific constraints. The project towns experience the following constraints: \n(i) \n\nIn Paksan, 75% of the population has access to piped water supply but no sewer \nnetwork  is  in  place.  Only  12%  of  households  have  properly  constructed  and \nmanaged  septic  tanks.  The  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-funded \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  will  expand  water  supply,  which \nrequires a proper wastewater treatment system.10 The municipal waste collection \nsystem only serves 50% of households in 15 of the 22 villages. The collected waste \nis disposed of in open dump sites or elsewhere, often blocking drainage canals. \nFlooding and riverine erosion are major issues, as the town is at the confluence of \nthe Mekong and San rivers. \nIn Thakhek, 62% of the population has access to piped water supply, but no sewer \nnetwork is in place and only 20% of the households have septic tanks. Solid waste \nis collected from only 60% of the households in 26 of the 35 villages, and there is \nno appropriate waste dump site to ensure proper treatment and disposal. Flooding \nfrom the Mekong River and from increasingly intense rainfall and riverine erosion \nare major issues. Only about 30% of the town has roadside drains, many of which \nare blocked because waste collects in the drains. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n10. \nFinancial management. The income of Bolikhamxay and Khammouan DPWTs and the \ntowns\u2019  UDAAs  relies  on  funding  from  the  central  government.  In  fiscal  year  (FY)  2016, \nBolikhamxay DPWT\u2019s annual local revenue covered only 26% of its recurrent expenditures, while \nKhammouan  DPWT\u2019s  annual  local  revenue  accounted  for  37%.  Similarly,  the  Paksan  and \nThakhek  UDAAs  are  heavily  dependent  on  provincial  and  central  government  transfers.  For \nFY2016,  Paksan  UDAA\u2019s  annual  local  revenue  accounted  for  only  50%  of  its  recurrent \nexpenditure while Thakhek UDAA\u2019s annual local revenue accounted for 12%.  \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s assistance and lessons learned. Lessons incorporated from previous projects \nand  two  ongoing  GMS  corridor  towns  development  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR  include \n(i) concentrating  investments  in  the  same  sector  (i.e.,  sanitation  and  flood  protection)  and  the \nsame GMS corridor to achieve synergies in development impact; (ii) ensuring the project finances \nhousehold connections and onsite plumbing  costs,  as these are crucial  to the  operational  and \nfinancial viability of the wastewater system; and (iii) providing advisory support for developing a \nfinancial sustainability road map for all investments.11 \n                                                \n10  ADB.  2013.

ADB  is  a  lead  partner  in  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  water  and  other \nurban infrastructure and services.12 Japan International Cooperation Agency has supported the \ndevelopment of a master plan for Vientiane and financed urban environment and water supply \ninvestment  in  the  city.  The  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  has  mainly  focused  on  rural \ndevelopment and heritage conservation projects. In Thakhek, the project will complement Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency\u2019s  water  supply  project  and  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement\u2019s tourism project. The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation supports \ncapacity development in the water supply sector along with ADB\u2019s ongoing Small Towns Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project. 13 Other  partners  such  as  the  World  Health  Organization,  the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank\u2019s Water and Sanitation Program \nhave been actively involved in water supply and sanitation.  \n  \n13. \nStrategic context. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and Urban Operational \nPlan.14 It also aligns with the Lao PDR\u2019s Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan, \n2016\u20132020, highlighting the need to address the challenges of rapid urbanization such as waste \nmanagement, traffic safety, migration, and other socioeconomic issues (footnote 2). It addresses \nkey  development  challenges  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR,  2017\u2013\n202015\u2014 that responds to limited progress in delivery of urban environmental services, leading to \nenvironmental degradation and low economic competitiveness.  \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  support  to  GMS  corridor  towns  is  a  unique  long-term \nengagement  to  transform  the  regional  transport  corridor  into  an  economic  corridor. 16  This \nengagement has two significant benefits. First, the project effectively complements other ADB-\nfinanced projects in the towns. While the GMS Tourism Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth Project \nsupports tourism around Thakhek,17 this project will ensure the environmental infrastructure in the \ncity is able to manage the waste from the increased tourist flow sustainably. Second, the project \nwill pilot test a decentralized wastewater system, construct SWTPs for sparsely populated areas, \nand provide a platform for the Lao PDR to observe the performance and replicate the model in \nother  small  towns  if  successful.  This  approach to  improved  sanitation  will  allow  the  country  to \npromote its Urban Sanitation Strategy effectively.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n12 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 2008.

The wastewater and \n22. \ndrainage design is based on the projected storm water runoff and wastewater generation, and the \nrequired treated effluent quality for receiving waters.21 Analysis of various system and treatment \noptions confirmed that decentralized SWTPs was an economically viable option as this approach \n(i) supports the Lao PDR\u2019s strategy of transitioning from septic tanks and soak pits to a centralized \nsystem; (ii) offers low O&M cost; and (iii) builds on ADB\u2019s experience in wastewater management \nwhere small towns often benefit from an SWTP approach for wastewater based on low population \ndensities. 22 A  controlled  landfill  option,  to  be  built  on  the  existing  dump  sites  with  sufficient \ncapacity  to  accommodate  waste  until  2040,  was  selected  for  solid  waste.  Reinjection  and \nrecirculation  were  selected  as  a  practical  option  for  leachate  treatment,  consistent  with  ADB-\nrecommended practices.23 The project will finance the retirement of existing waste in the dump \nsites in a controlled cell. It considered technology by analyzing the O&M budget and technical \ncapacity of local government engineers.  \n \n23. \nThe project is classified high risk from climate change impacts because of the Lao PDR\u2019s \nhigh  exposure  to  intensifying  weather-related  events  and  the  low  adaptive  capacity  of \ncommunities and local governments. A detailed climate change assessment has been prepared.24 \nThe  project  design  includes  climate  adaptation  and  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  for  the \ndrainage networks where pipes have been designed to cater to 10-year flood return periods plus \na safety factor for climate change. Additional measures include raising embankments and paving \nlandfill access roads with concrete to ensure all-weather access. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis. The project is economically viable. The economic analysis followed \n24. \nADB  guidelines  and  covered  25  years  from  the  start  of  implementation  in  2019.  Benefits  of \nimproved  sanitation  were  quantified  in  terms  of  health  and  environmental  benefits  using  the \ndisability-adjusted  life-year  approach.  Benefits  for  drainage  and  riverbank  improvement  were \nquantified based on avoidance of flood damage and losses caused by disrupted economic activity \nduring floods. Benefits for improved SWM are reduced pollution in the service areas and avoided \ncontamination  of  groundwater  and  pollution  in  the  landfill  sites  and  adjacent  areas,  which  are \nquantified  under  the  disability-adjusted  life-year  approach.  The  benefits  of  the  urban  renewal \ncomponent  in  Thakhek  were  quantified  based  on  the  marginal  increased  expenses  of  foreign \ntourists visiting the town. The overall project economic internal rate of return for the two towns is \n13.0% for the base case scenario and 11.0%\u201312.9% for the sensitivity tests, which are above the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%. \n \n25. \nFinancial  analysis.  A  financial  evaluation  of  the  revenue-generating  wastewater \ntreatment and SWM components in the two towns indicated that the government will be unable \nto achieve full cost recovery through the projected tariffs in the medium term. To ensure financial \nsustainability,  it  has  committed  to  preparing  a  financial  sustainability  road  map,  including \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n21 Wastewater  treatment  plants  will  meet  standards  for  discharge  into  public  water  areas  and  sewers  (i.e.,  30 \n\nmilligram/liter biological oxygen demand and 125 milligram/liter chemical oxygen demand). \n\n22 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2018.

Capacity development and training assistance will be provided by the \nproject  implementation  consultants  to  the  PCU  and  PIUs  on  financial  and  procurement \nmanagement, asset management, and fund disbursement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MPWT and the DPWT. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nThe project will benefit about 1,650 households in Paksan, including 17 poor households \n27. \nand  145  households  headed  by  women;  and  1,250  households  in  Thakhek,  including  60  poor \nhouseholds and 183 households headed by women, through improved wastewater collection and \ntreatment  services.  Some  4,205  households  in  Paksan,  including  42  poor  households  and \n445 households  headed  by  women;  and  6,440  households  in  Thakhek,  including  199  poor \nhouseholds  and  738  households  headed  by  women,  will  benefit  from  solid  waste  collection \nservices under the project. Stormwater drainage in Thakhek will benefit 9,645 households, while \nthe riverbank protection and enhanced urban space in Paksan will benefit 4,465 households. The \nproject is classified general intervention. Through improved urban services, project area residents \nwill benefit from reduced loss of productivity, medical expenditures, and indebtedness. Pro-poor \ndesign features in both towns include (i) free wastewater connections for all households in the \nSWTP  service  areas  and  free  re-plumbing  for  poor  households;  (ii)  expanded  solid  waste \ncollection to un-serviced areas and free solid waste collection for poor households; (iii) livelihood \nsecurity and safe work conditions for waste pickers linked to controlled landfill investments; and \n(iv) improved design features of riverbank areas and the town center in Thakhek through better \nstreet lighting and public toilets for women and men, which will enhance the livelihoods of self-\nemployed traders and vendors. \n \n28. \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment identified \nkey  gender  issues  as  limited  access  to  reliable,  safe,  and  affordable  urban  services;  and  low \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  sector  representation.  Women\u2019s  traditional  role  as  caregivers  for  sick \nfamily  members  leads  to  increased  responsibilities  arising  from  illnesses  linked  to  poor \nenvironmental  sanitation. Women\u2019s  priorities for the  project,  based  on  extensive consultations, \ninclude reduced local flooding, improved public health, and affordable urban services. The gender \naction  plan  includes  (i)  targets  to  increase  women\u2019s  representation  in  PCU  and  PIU  decision-\nmaking  and  technical  positions,  (ii)  gender-responsive  measures  in  the  urban  development \nstrategy  and  master  plan  development,  and  (iii)  targets  for  training  women  on  planning  and \nservice urban service delivery. \n                                                \n25 ADB.

Two  initial  environmental  examination  reports  and  two \nenvironmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  one  per  town,  have  been  prepared  based  on \npreliminary designs. The initial environmental examinations and EMPs were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 5 July 2018. Approval from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and/or \nprovincial Department of Natural Resources and Environment will be obtained before awarding \ncivil works contracts. The EMPs define mitigation and monitoring measures for identified impacts, \ninstitutional  arrangements,  and  budget  for  implementation.  The  government  will  oversee  EMP \nimplementation  with  the  support  of  consulting  services.  Baseline  and  periodic  environmental \nmonitoring of environmental receptors have been included in the costs. Public and stakeholder \nconsultations informed the project design and will continue during implementation. A grievance \nredress mechanism will help facilitate the resolution of complaints regarding project performance. \n \n31. \nAll project sites have been selected to avoid impacts on sensitive environmental receptors. \nThe  construction  of  SWTPs  and  controlled  landfills  and  the  closure  of  existing  dump  sites, \nimproved  drainage,  flood  protection,  and  improved  amenity  facilities  will  have  significant \nenvironmental and health benefits. Short-term, localized impacts such as surface water quality \ndeterioration,  noise,  dust,  traffic,  and  waste  generation  will  occur  during  construction.  The  key \nrisks during operation are effluent and leachate management. All discharge will be treated to the \nrequired  national  standards  and  will  be  closely  monitored.  Construction  and  operational \nenvironmental impacts and risks can be prevented or minimized to an acceptable degree through \neffective implementation of the EMP and capacity building. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). A resettlement plan has been prepared for each \n32. \ntown following consultations with affected households. The resettlement plans were disclosed on \nthe ADB website on 5 July 2018 and will be updated at the detailed design stage. An external \nmonitor has been allocated to monitor implementation. The resettlement plans also set out the \ngrievance redress and institutional mechanisms for the implementation of the resettlement plans. \nIn  total,  507  households  (219  households  in  Paksan  and  288  households  in  Thakhek)  will  be \naffected, but the impact to most households (468 households) will be minor. About 170 persons \nwill be severely affected, either needing relocation (from the riverbank and the solid waste facility) \nor  losing  more  than  10%  of  their  income  because  of  land  acquisition.  The  project  will  acquire  \n39,718 square meters (m2) of residential land (12,213 m2 in Paksan and 27,505 m2 in Thakhek) \nand  107,297  m2  of  agricultural  land  (50,342  m2  in  Paksan  and  56,955  m2  in  Thakhek)  from \nhouseholds in the two towns. \n \n33. \nIndigenous peoples (category C).
