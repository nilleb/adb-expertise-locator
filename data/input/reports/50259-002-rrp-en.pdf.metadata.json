It will upgrade \nand  expand  water  supply  networks,  improve  climate  change  awareness  and  resilience,  build \ninstitutional  capacity,  and strengthen  the  sustainability  of  the  RK\u2019s  water  supply  and  sanitation \n(WSS) utility.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nSpanning more than 165,000 square kilometers, the RK covers the entire northwestern \nextremity  of  Uzbekistan.2  It  has  a  dispersed  population  of  about  1.8  million,  and  its  primary \neconomic  drivers  are  agriculture,  natural  gas,  and  minerals.  The  RK\u2019s  natural  environment  is \nprimarily arid desert comprising sparse, barren lands that are subject to severe drought. As such, \nthe  RK  suffers from  acute surface  water  shortage.  Although aquifers  exist,  the groundwater  is \nmostly saline and of limited value, as it is prohibitively expensive to treat for human consumption. \nWater supply conditions are therefore critical. \n \n4. \nMunicipal water supply services in the RK are provided by a regional WSS utility, the State \nUnitary  Enterprise  Department  for  Operation  of  Interregional Water  Supply  Tuyamuyun-Nukus \n(TN).3  Although  operational,  TN  faces  considerable  challenges  as  most  of  its  Soviet-era \ninfrastructure  has  depreciated  to  the  point  of  dilapidation.  Its  services  are  unreliable,  leakage \nlosses  are  high,  and  water  quality  is  a  growing  concern.  These  deficiencies  prevent  TN  from \ndelivering  services  that  meet  regulator  and  public  expectations,  which  in  turn  undermines \nconsumer confidence and willingness to pay, increases regulator reluctance to raise tariffs, and \nreduces financial and institutional performance. As with similar utilities in Uzbekistan, the TN has \nbecome locked in a vicious cycle that requires external intervention to modernize and expand its \nasset base while overhauling its institutional capacity. \n \n5. \nTN\u2019s service deficiencies relate directly to poor WSS sector performance. In the RK, only \n37% of the population in the project area\u201413% in rural areas\u2014is connected to the centralized \nwater supply system. Recent surveys indicate that 40% of connected households receive water \nfor less than 6 hours per week and that water pressures are often low. About 75% of connected \nhouseholds reportedly experience excessive  water salinity and hardness issues. 4 Correlations \nare also frequently drawn between poor water quality and waterborne disease incidence.5 The \nsubstantial consumer base that is yet to be connected to a centralized water supply is forced to \npurchase water from trucked supplies at exorbitant prices or consume water that is increasingly \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Western Uzbekistan \n\nWater Supply System Development Project. \n\n2  Established  through  the  1992  Constitution  of  Uzbekistan,  the  RK  is  an  integral  region  of  Uzbekistan  that  has \n\nprotected sovereignty, an autonomous status, and its own constitution. \n\n3  The  TN  has  about  1,650  employees.  Its  centralized  system  services  41,979  domestic  and  770  institutional  and \n\ncommercial consumers. It also provides trucked water to 6,282 consumers in remote areas. \n\n4  ADB.  2017.

The  initial  phase,  driven  largely  by  the  Decree  of  the  Cabinet  of \nMinisters No. 306, has led to the consolidation of Karakalpakstan\u2019s WSS services into TN and the \nimplementation of more than 40 time-bound corporate governance improvements to strengthen \nutility capacity.7 The second phase is overhauling the wider institutional framework by creating \nthe Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (MHCS).8 The Agency Kommunhizmat (CSA), \nreporting to the MHCS, is responsible for implementing externally funded projects including those \nfunded by ADB.9 \n \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u2013202010 and Country \n7. \nOperations  Business  Plan,  2018\u20132020  for  Uzbekistan.11  It  will  support  the  government\u2019s WSS \nreform program by helping improve TN\u2019s institutional capacity, while revitalizing its regional water \nsupply system in six of the 14 districts of the RK.12 Benefitting 388,000 inhabitants, the project will \nprovide reliable and safe water supply through metered household connections.13 \n \n8. \nLessons to  be  incorporated  in  the  project  design from  previous  ADB  sector  experience \ninclude  (i)  securing  timely  counterpart  support  by  engaging  government  agencies  at  the  early \nstage  of  project  preparation,  (ii)  improving  project  quality  and  efficiency  by  adopting  least-cost \nsolutions in project design, (iii) providing training and capacity building of project implementation \npersonnel to reduce procurement and construction delay, and (iv) accelerating domestic approval \nprocedures by engaging design institutes during project preparation. \n \n9. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project enables the government to implement the \nmost  efficient  solution  in  meeting  water  supply  demands  in  the  RK.  It  will  also  introduce \ninternational best practices and support WSS reforms, including tariff reforms and the phase out \nof flat tariffs. The government would not be able to incorporate these interventions without ADB \nsupport. \n \nB. \n \n10. \n\nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  climate  resilience,  health  and  living \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n6  Survey results show that household consumers purchase trucked water from TN at a cost of SUM5,000 per cubic \n\nmeter (m3) versus a piped water tariff of SUM675/m3. \n\n7  Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2015.

In  addition  to \noverall technical viability, system continuity, raw water quality for treatment, and constructability, \nthe selection of the districts was based on weighted criteria relating to population, public health \nand safety, climate change vulnerability, and economic development potential. \n \n21. \nDue to the unique water resource situation in the RK, in that surface water from the Amu \nDarya River constitutes the primary and reliable water source, technically and financially viable \noptions are limited to (i) centralized treatment and long-haul transmissions to distribution centers; \n(ii) localized treatment using groundwater; and (iii) centralized treatment at three optimal locations \nand with supplemental local groundwater treatment where feasible. Option (iii) was recommended \ndue to its least cost and maximum beneficial impacts. The water supply infrastructure developed \nunder Option (iii) will also serve as the main grid of the RK water supply system for future water \nsupply service development in the eight remaining districts of the territory. The proposed design \nand technology are compatible with local conditions and the capacity of the TN. Technical features \nand the selection of materials incorporate measures for climate change resilience and adaptation. \nOpen-cut and trenchless methods using high-density polyethylene pipe will be adopted. \n\n                                                \n17 Advertisement expected in the third quarter of 2018. \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n22. \n In September 2017, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan devalued the local \ncurrency by 92.38% to $1 = SUM8,100. However, recent procurement for WSS projects funded \nby international financial institutions showed that the estimated contract costs in  United States \ndollars  have  remained  unchanged.  The  uncertainty  brought  by  the  sum\u2019s  devaluation  will  be \ncarefully monitored during project implementation. \n \nEconomic analysis. An economic analysis was conducted following ADB guidelines and \n23. \nderived benefits from (i) incremental water consumption calculated using willingness to pay and \nwater demand projections as proxies; and (ii) resource cost savings from non-incremental water \nsales when households switch from alternative water sources to piped water.  It also estimated \nthe health benefits from the improved reliability and quality of non-incremental water consumption \nleading to potentially lowered incidence of waterborne diseases in the project areas. The resulting \nbase-case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  11.47%,  exceeding  ADB\u2019s  prescribed  minimum \ndiscount  rate  of  9.00%  and  confirming  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability.  A  sensitivity  analysis \nundertaken to test economic viability determined that the project will remain economically robust \nunder  the  following  scenarios:  (i)  a  10%  increase  in  investment  cost,  (ii)  a  10%  increase  in \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs, (iii) a 10% decline in benefits, (iv) a combination of the \nfirst three scenarios, and (v) a 1-year delay in subproject benefits. The sensitivity analysis shows \nthat the economic internal rate of return is most sensitive to a combination of an increase in capital \ncost with a decrease in benefits, and least sensitive to an increase in O&M costs. \n \n24. \n Financial  analysis.  A  financial  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  was  conducted  and  the  results \nconfirmed the financial viability of the project. The calculated financial internal rate of return was \n1.42%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 0.45%. The sensitivity analysis showed \nthat  financial  viability  will  be  at  risk  if  increased  investments  and  O&M  costs  are  combined \nsimultaneously with a decline in tariff revenues. To yield a positive financial internal rate of return, \nThe analysis assumed under a worst-case scenario that tariffs would need to be increased by \nabout 180% in real terms by 2023. Nominally, this entails increasing the tariff for residential users \nfrom  the  current  rate  of  SUM675/cubic  meter  (m3)  to  SUM2,786/m3  by  2024.  The  assumed \nincrease  in  tariffs  requires  an  annual  real  rate  of  increase  of  14.5%,  which  is  higher  than  the \n12.3%  historical  average  of  the  real  rate  of  tariff  increases  in  the  RK  since  2012.18  ADB  has \ndiscussed  the  proposed  rate  of  increase  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  TN,  and  both  have \nagreed  that  the  rate  is  reasonable  given  the  exceptionally  high  demand  for  clean,  safe,  and \nreliable water supply in the project districts and the lower tariff increases from 2012 to 2017. The \ntariff  would  also  be  affordable  to  targeted  household  beneficiaries  that  have  expressed  their \nwillingness to pay more for cleaner, safer, and more reliable water systems. At present, most of \nthem access clean water through trucks or vendors at a higher cost of SUM5,000/m3. \n \nTo ensure financial sustainability, the government remains committed to support TN\u2019s debt \n25. \nservicing19 and Uzbekistan\u2019s water tariff reforms.20 The analysis indicates that TN\u2019s operating ratio \nwill exceed one, which is required to maintain the company\u2019s financial sustainability. \n \n\n                                                \n18 Ministry of Finance revised water tariffs annually until 2009, and twice a year thereafter (in April and October). \n19 Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2012.  Resolution  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  \u201cAbout \nAdditional Measures for Ensuring Timely Servicing of the Foreign Credit and Borrowed Funds Raised for Project \nImplementation  on  Improvement  of  Water  Supply  in  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  and  the  Khorezm  Region.\u201d \nNo. 66. Tashkent (7 March). Resolution No. 66 stipulates that the government will subsidize an average of 93% of \nTN\u2019s debt servicing requirements until 2043. \n\n20 ADB  approved  a  technical  assistance  on  water  and  sanitation  strategy  development  and  capacity  building  in \n\nUzbekistan to assist the government in improving its water tariff regulatory framework. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nC. \n \n26. \nOriginally  established  as  an  interregional  bulk  producer  and  supplier  of  water  from  the \nTuyamuyun system to water distribution agencies, the TN was reorganized in 2016 to become a \nstate-owned enterprise solely responsible for providing WSS in the RK. In general, officers and \nstaff possess moderate knowledge and skills in financial management, which are expected to be \nstrengthened  by  the  government\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  sector  reforms  and  improved \ngovernance. These  initiatives encompass major  legislative and regulatory  reforms;  institutional \nrationalization;  and  a  renewed  focus  on  efficiency,  accountability,  and  sustainability  through \nimproved cost recovery. \n \n27. \nThe  overall  financial  management  risk  rating  of  the  TN  is  moderate  for  the  following \nreasons:  (i)  it  has  limited  experience  in  managing  advance  accounts;21  (ii)  adjustments  are \nnecessary to its accounting, budgeting, auditing, and reporting systems for the project\u2019s financial \nmanagement; and (iii) its staff lack sufficient understanding of ADB\u2019s loan disbursement policies \nand procedures. CSA has experience in implementing WSS projects funded by ADB, the World \nBank, and other international financial institutions; and it will supervise and guide TN to mitigate \nthe financial management risk. Under CSA\u2019s overall supervision, TN will have access to financial \nmanagement consultants and training. \n \nProcurement  risk  assessment  confirmed  that  the  overall  risk  is  high  mainly  because  of \n28. \nprolonged government oversight procedures and implementation delays experienced by CSA in \nits  past  procurement  transactions. With  the  project  risk  mitigation measures  and other  support \nactivities  implemented,  however,  CSA  generally  satisfies  ADB  requirements  for  an  executing \nagency and its system is adequate to (i) prepare qualified bidding documents; and (ii) conduct the \nprocurement of works, goods, equipment, and consulting services. Engaging international PMCs \nwill strengthen CSA further and will ensure that all procurement procedures are conducted with \ndue  consideration for  economy,  efficiency,  and  transparency.  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with \ngovernment agencies to minimize delays. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  CSA,  and  TN.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  supports  poverty  reduction  indirectly  through  improved  access  to  safe  and \n30. \nreliable drinking water. More than half of the 388,000 inhabitants in the project area are poor.22 \nOnly  37%  of  project  households  have  access  to  piped  water  while  the  rest  use  hand-pumped \nwater or other sources for their living needs. Some 15% of households purchase drinking water \nand  9%  use  potentially  unsafe  water  from  open  sources  (canals  and  rivers)  for  drinking  and \ncooking  because  of  unstable  water  supply.  Only  21%  of  households  in  the  project  area  have \nbathrooms with piped water supply and only 2% have flushing toilets. Just 34% of households are \nsatisfied  with  the  quality  of  piped  water.  Kindergartens,  schools,  colleges,  medical  institutions, \nand  hospitals  (about  450  social  establishments)  lack  adequate  water  supply  and  improved \nsanitation  facilities.  Better  access  to  safe  and  reliable  potable  water  will  improve  hygiene  and \nsanitation  practices,  improve  public  health,  and  reduce  household  costs  for  medical  care.  The \n                                                \n21 Following  previous  government  practice  in  the  Uzbekistan  WSS  sector,  implementing  agencies  did  not  manage \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n22 Using  the  1.5  times  the  minimum  monthly  wage  as  a  poverty  threshold,  the  poverty  and  social  assessment \n\nconsidered more than half of the project area\u2019s households as poor. \n\nadvance accounts. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fproject will improve the health, living conditions, and productivity of residents while contributing to \npoverty reduction in the target areas.23 \n \n31.  WSS constraints negatively affect the quality of life of all family members, especially of \nwomen,  who  are  primarily  responsible  for  delivering  water,  cooking,  cleaning,  and  caring  for \nchildren and sick and disabled family members. The project will directly reduce the workload of \nwomen and girls, freeing up their time and providing them with greater opportunities for economic \nand educational activities. \n \n32. \nThe project\u2019s primary beneficiaries will be about 388,000 inhabitants, about 50% of whom \nare women and girls. Project implementation will reduce unproductive labor costs, sparing about \nthree  working  days  for  women  every  month,  and  develop  improved  sanitation  practices  and \npositive hygiene behavior among women and schoolchildren to ensure maximum health benefits. \nAt  least  178,000  women  and  girls  will  have  access  to  continuous  potable  centralized  water \nsupplies. The project  is classified  effective  gender mainstreaming. Gender-specific  actions  are \nset  out  in  the  gender  action  plan  with  the  following  key  features:  recruitment  of  a  PCU  social \ndevelopment  and  gender  specialist,  facilitation  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  project-associated \nactivities, and provision of employment opportunities for women in laboratory and customer care \nunits  and  during  the  construction  period.24  The  project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  envisages  the \ncollection of sex-disaggregated data on most of the planned activities. \n \nE. \n \n33. \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n34. \nEnvironment (category B). Project impacts are expected to be limited in magnitude and \nshort-term in nature, and to mostly relate to the construction and rehabilitation of the distribution \ncenters,  transmission  mains,  and  distribution  networks.  These  include  dust,  noise,  vibration, \nhazardous  solid  waste  (asbestos-containing  materials,  scrap  metals,  and  oils  from  old \nequipment), labor and public safety, temporary blockage of household access, traffic disturbance, \nand  the  production  and  transportation  of  construction  materials.  CSA  has  included  mitigation \nmeasures  to  address  construction  and  operational  impacts  in  the  environmental  management \nplan (EMP), which it prepared as part of the initial environmental examination. \n \n35. \nEnvironmental impacts during the operation phase include increased water use from water \nsources,  the  disposal  of  sludge  from  the  WTPs  and  borehole  sites,  accidental  leakage  from \nchlorination, noise from WTPs and pumping stations, and higher sewage production relative to \nthe capability of community facilities. The implementation of a planned regional sewerage system \nwill mitigate impacts from increased sewage production.26 In addition, the project incorporates a \nsanitation and hygiene improvement program that pilots wastewater improvements for poor, rural \nhouseholds.27  The  initial  environmental  examination  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on \n6 September 2017. CSA conducted public consultations in all project districts. \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB.

The  government  will  conduct  an  awareness  program  before  the  sewerage  system  is \noperationalized. \n\n27 Rural Sanitation and Hygiene Improvement Program, anticipated to pilot the installation of septic tanks. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fThe  PCU  in  CSA  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation  and  for  compliance  with \n36. \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  and  national  environmental  regulations.  The  PCU\u2019s  existing \nsafeguard staff will be assisted by the PMC\u2019s environmental specialists, who will oversee EMP \nimplementation.  A full-time safeguard staff member will be provided to the implementing agency. \nThe project will finance EMP implementation costs, while mitigation measures and environmental \nmonitoring  costs  will  be  included  in  the  construction  contracts  and  environmental  supervision \ncosts will be included in the PMC consulting services. A grievance redress mechanism to handle \nboth environmental  and social  safeguard  issues will  be  established after project  effectiveness. \nThe  PCU  will  submit  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  relevant \ngovernment authorities, and these reports will be disclosed to the public on the websites of CSA \n(in Uzbek or Russian) and ADB (in English). \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  resettlement  due  diligence  conducted for \n37. \nthe  project,  based  on  the  preliminary  design  and  walkover  surveys,  suggests  that  no  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts will occur, as construction works will be within the existing \nfacilities owned by the TN, on municipal land, on state land reserve, and within the rights-of-way \nassigned  to  municipal  roads  and  municipal  infrastructure.  Certification  of  land  ownership  was \nprovided  by  the  TN.  In  compliance  with  ADB  requirements,  CSA  prepared  a  resettlement \nframework  to  ensure that  unanticipated  impacts  are  considered  during  detailed  design.  If  land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts or related unanticipated impacts are identified \nduring implementation, CSA will prepare a resettlement plan following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement, which it will submit to ADB for review before awarding any contracts and implement \nbefore starting civil works. \n \nAs part of the resettlement due diligence, CSA conducted 71 in-depth interviews and nine \n38. \npublic  consultations  in  the  six  project  districts.  Communities  expressed  an  immense  need  for \nclean and reliable drinking water supply in the project influence area, which could be achieved \nthrough the project. CSA, through the PCU, will carry out meaningful consultations throughout the \nproject  cycle.  The  executing  and/or  implementing  agency  will  establish  an  effective  gender-\ninclusive  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  receive,  record,  and  facilitate  the  resolution  of \ncommunities\u2019 concerns related to any project impacts, with attention to vulnerable people. \n \nThe PCU has a dedicated safeguard specialist who will ensure that all activities related to \n39. \ninvoluntary  land  acquisition  follow  Uzbek  legislation  and  policies  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement requirements. The PCU will ensure that the resettlement framework is updated after \ndetailed design is completed, and a resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented before \nstarting  civil  works  if  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  is  identified.  The  PMC  will \nsupport the PCU. \n \n40. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project areas have an ethnic composition of 55% \nUzbeks, 26% Karakalpaks, and 16% Kazakhs.
