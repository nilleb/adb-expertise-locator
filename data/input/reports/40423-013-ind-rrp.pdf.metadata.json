For the investments in physical infrastructure to be effective \nand sustainable, the investment program will also focus on improving institutional arrangements, \nbusiness  processes,  and  associated  capacity  building,  especially  in  relation  to  design, \noperation, safeguards, finance, road safety, and asset management.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nRoad  map.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  India  is  closely  aligned  with \n3. \nthe  priorities  of  India\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012.  The  CPS  reconfirms  continuing \nADB assistance for development of rural roads, which are critical for rural development as they \nprovide  access  to  markets,  health,  education,  and  administrative  services.  Absence  of  all-\nweather road connectivity is a serious problem, making rural communities inaccessible for up to \n90  days  a  year.  Poor  road  infrastructure  affects  economic  growth  in  rural  areas,  agricultural \nproductivity,  and  employment,  and  has  a  strong  link  to  poverty.  The  Government  of  India  is \naddressing  this  problem  through  implementation  of  a  nationwide  rural  road  investment \nprogram\u2014the Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program (PMGSY)\u2014aimed at providing all-weather \nroad  connectivity  to  currently  unconnected  eligible  habitations  in  India\u2019s  rural  areas.  The \ninvestment program will support the government\u2019s objectives under the PMGSY. \n\n \nStrategic  context  and  policy  framework.  The  specific  contribution  of  the  PMGSY  to \n4. \nthe  achievement  of  country  strategic  development goals  includes  reducing  poverty  (faster  and \nmore  inclusive  growth),  expanding  and  strengthening  rural  infrastructure  to  accelerate \nagricultural  growth  and  the  rural  economy,  creating  jobs,  and  social  development  (improved \neducation, health, and social indicators). The PMGSY is also very relevant to the pillars of the \npolicy  framework  in  the  road  sector,  including  sustainability  (promoting  longer-term  road \nmaintenance), road safety (mainstreaming road safety audits and community awareness), and \nseamless connectivity (as rural roads provide the \u2015last mile\u2016 connectivity). \n\n \n5. \nInvestment program. The PMGSY identified the investment program states among the \n10 states with large rural populations that lack adequate coverage in terms of all-weather road \nconnectivity. The poverty head count rates in these states are among the highest in India. The \nPMGSY  started  in  2000  and  has  thus  far  constructed  108,637  km  of  rural  roads  in  the \ninvestment program states, connecting 39,721 habitations to a greater transportation network.3 \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB provided project preparatory TA. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Third Rural Road \n\nSector Investment Program. Manila. \n\n3  Chhattisgarh  and  Madhya  Pradesh  have  been  provided  with  ADB  assistance  under  ADB.  2003.  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nConstruction  of  an  additional  32,158  km  of  roads  is  ongoing.  According  to  the  June  2011 \nprogram  update,  85,690  km  of  roads  to  connect  all  remaining  eligible  habitations  in  the \ninvestment program states are yet to be constructed under the PMGSY. \n\n \nThe latest estimate for the remaining PMGSY financing requirement to achieve its goal \n6. \nby 2016 in the investment program states is about $7.95 billion, while available PMGSY funding  \nfor the same period is estimated to be around $5.04 billion. While exploring the possibilities for \ndomestic borrowing to close the financial gap, the government has approached ADB to provide \nfunding  of  $0.8  billion  under  the  investment  program  to  assist  with  the  implementation  of  the \nPMGSY  in  the  investment  program  states.  The  investment  program  is  consistent  with  the \nstrategic objective set out in the CPS, 2009\u20132012 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2011\u20132013. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n7. \nLessons learned from the previous ADB rural roads projects in the investment program \nstates  (footnote  3)  show  that,  the  states  also  need  support  in  improving  business  procedures \ncovering  the  whole  life  cycle  of  rural  roads,  and  strengthening  related  capacities.  Specifically, \nwhile the  emphasis  is  shifting from  construction  to the  operation  and maintenance of  the rural \nroad  network,4 the related  capacities for rural road network management are  lagging. There  is \nalso  a  mismatch  between  the  extent  of  the  rural  road  network  (around  80%  of  the  total  road \nnetwork) and supply of skills, as the training of civil engineers, technicians, and site supervisors \nis oriented towards high-category roads. Another lesson learned shows the necessity of better \ndevelopment coordination with the World Bank, which in addition to the geographical delineation \nof effort should strive to achieve synergies of the interventions between the two partners.5  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe long-term impact of the investment program will be reduced poverty and deprivation, \nand  inclusive  socioeconomic  growth  in  the  communities  served  by  the  investment  program \nroads  in  Assam,  Chhattisgarh,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa,  and  West  Bengal.  The  immediate \noutcome  will  be  improved  and  sustainable  connectivity  of  rural  communities  in  the  investment \nprogram states to markets, district headquarters, and other centers of economic activity. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  investment  program  will  have  six  outputs.  These  include  that:  (i)  selected  priority \nrural  roads  will  be  constructed  to  all-weather  standard;  (ii)  the  design  quality  of  investment \nprogram  roads  will  be  improved;  (iii)  maintenance  of  the  investment  program  roads  will  be \nimproved and sustained; (iv) road safety measures will be incorporated into the life cycle of the \ninvestment program roads; (v) the qualification and skills of PMGSY engineers, technicians, site \nsupervisors,  panchayati  raj  institution  staff  concerned,6 design  consultants,  and  contractors  in \n                                                                                                                                                       \nIndia for the Rural Roads Sector I Project.

Manila (Loan 2248-IND), to be closed in 2013. More details are in the sector \nassessment summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nOutputs \n\n4  Specifically, more than 65,000 km are currently on 5-year post-construction maintenance, and the length of roads \nbeyond  5-year  post-construction  maintenance  will  increase  from  around  17,000  km  to  more  than  80,000  km  by \n2016. \n\n5   Development coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  A panchayat is a body of directly elected people responsible for development of activities in an area constituted for \nrural  areas  under  Article  243-B  of  the  Constitution  of  India.  The  three  levels  of  panchayati  raj  institution  are  the \ngram panchayat at a village level, intermediate panchayat at a block level, and zilla panchayat (called a parishad in \nsome states) at a district level. These panchayats are collectively called \u2015panchayati raj institutions\u2016.  \n\n\fthe  investment  program  states  will  be  improved  and  maintained;  and  (vi)  effective  project \nmanagement will be provided. \n \n10. \nRoad  infrastructure  development.  Under  the investment program, about 9,000 km of \nall-weather rural roads will be constructed in the investment program states, which will connect \naround  4,200  habitations. 7  The  investment  program  will  pilot  the  use  of  new  construction \ntechnologies8 and the use of local materials will be increased. The adopted all-weather standard \nwill  increase  the  resilience  of  communities  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  All  constructed \nroads  will  be  maintained  under  5-year  performance-based  maintenance  contracts.  Selected \ndistricts  will  pilot  contracts  linking  payments  with  the  achievement  of  both  the  performance \nstandards  and  a  degree  of  consistency  of  performance,  thus  introducing  a  public\u2013private \npartnership  approach  to  road  maintenance.  Another  pilot  will  involve  community-based \nprotection of roads from excessive loads. \n\n \n11. \nInstitutional  Strengthening. The  investment  program  will  support:  (i)  establishment of \npilot  rural  road  network  management  units  (RRNMUs)  for  effective  and  high quality  life    cycle \nrural road network management with emphasis on performance-based maintenance of created \nassets; and (ii) establishment of rural connectivity training and research centers (RCTRCs). The \nsupport will include construction of modern facilities along with providing all necessary state-of-\nthe  art  equipment,  systems,  and  tools. 9 Consulting  services  will  include  developing  training \nmodules, assisting in research and compiling best practices in rural roads, supporting RCTRC \noperations, and rolling out large-scale rural roads-oriented training. A capacity development TA \nwill be provided to assist the roll out of RRNMUs and setting up of RCTRCs. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe investment program is estimated to cost $1,225.30 million equivalent, including civil \nworks, consulting services, equipment,  project management costs, social mitigation measures, \ntaxes,  duties,  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loan  during  construction \n(Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Investment Program Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nItem \nA. \n\n  \n\nBase Costb \n1.

The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2,300,000 \nequivalent,18 consisting of $1,300,000 equivalent on a grant basis to be financed by the Japan \nFund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB,  and  $1,000,000  equivalent  on  a  grant \nbasis  to  be  financed  from  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  This \nexcludes  the  in-kind  contribution  of  the  state  governments  providing  counterpart  staff,  and  all \nrelevant information and data. International consulting firms will be recruited by ADB according \nto its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The selection \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method using a quality\u2013cost \nratio  of  80:20.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n19. \nPMGSY guidelines will be followed in the selection of roads, and applicable standards of \nthe Indian Road Congress19 will be followed in preparation of designs. The states will also follow \nan improved road design process adopted for the investment program, as related to the design \ncontext, quality control, and incorporation of road safety measures. The project implementation \nconsultants will include safeguard experts to ensure the proper incorporation of safeguards and \ncommunity consultation in the process, and road safety experts to conduct road safety audits of \ndesigns, during and after construction. The technical support consultant will provide training and \nmonitoring of the implementation of the road safety audit recommendations. A feasibility study \nconducted  on  the  representative  sample20 in  all  investment  program  states  has  confirmed  that \nall  subprojects  selected  following  PMGSY  guidelines  are  technically  feasible.  The  study  has \nalso confirmed the feasibility of subprojects in terms of the social and environmental impacts. \n \nB. \n \nA  strong  body  of  evidence 21 exists  documenting  the  significant  benefits  provided  by \n20. \nincluding  health,  education,  agriculture,  poverty  reduction, \nPMGSY  all-weather  roads, \nemployment  and  income,  housing  facilities,  and  moveable  assets.  As  these  benefits  are  not \ncaptured  by  the  economic  analysis,  which  accounts  only  for  transport  cost  savings,  the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  threshold  of  10%  for  testing  economic  viability  was \nadopted. Economic analysis, which considered only passenger time savings and transport and \noperation  costs  conducted  on  the  representative  sample,  indicated  that  overall  the  investment \nprogram  is  economically  viable,  with  EIRRs  ranging  from  13.9%  to  16.4%  on  a  state-by-state \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n18 The cost estimates and financing plan for each TA component are in Appendix K of Facility Administration Manual \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n19 The  Indian  Road  Congress  is  the  national  body  responsible  for  sharing  knowledge  on  all  subjects  dealing  with \n\ntransportation. \n\n20 This consists of 112 roads, including around 59 km in Assam, 100 km in Chhattisgarh, 99 km in Madhya Pradesh, \n\n64 km in Odisha, and 82 km in West Bengal. \n\n21 ADB.  2012.

With \nboth  a  15%  increase  in  capital  costs  and  15%  decrease  in  benefits,  all  states  except  Odisha \ncontinue to have EIRRs of more than 10%; for Odisha, the EIRR is only slightly lower than 10%. \nEconomic analysis  was further  expanded to conservatively  estimate  only  two  out  of numerous \nadditional  benefits  of  providing  all-weather  rural  connectivity  for  a  few  road  sections  having \nEIRRs  of  less  than  10%.23 With  these  benefits  accounted  for,  the  EIRR  values  for  such  road \nsections \nin \nChhattisgarh,  11.5%  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  10.8%  in  Odisha,  thus  confirming  that  the \nproposed investment is economically viable, on both a state-by-state and road-by-road basis. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nInstitutional. The investment program states have established equivalents of state rural \nroads development agencies (SRRDAs)24 and field project implementation units to manage the \nPMGSY,  and  since  the  start  of  PMGSY  in  2000  have  developed  adequate  implementation \nexperience, qualifications, and capacities. The investment program states will use the services \nof the project implementation consultants to assist with implementing safeguard frameworks and \npiloting  new  road  safety  and  road  maintenance  procedures,  while  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment  (MORD)  and  the  National  Rural  Roads  Development  Agency  (NRRDA)  will  use \nthe  services  of  the  technical  support  consultant  for  the  overall  due  diligence,  training,  and \nmonitoring  of  compliance.  Capacity  development  TA  will  be  provided  to further  assist  with  the \nimplementation of the investment program\u2019s institutional strengthening component. \n \nFinancial management. The funds flow from MORD to the state governments will follow \n22. \nthe pattern of grants-in-aid under the centrally sponsored schemes of the Government of India, \nand  its  relevant  financial  rules  will  apply.  This  includes  providing  audited  utilization  certificates \nfor each fund release from MORD to the state governments and maintaining a separate account \nfor  the  central  government  funds  in  each  investment  program  state.  For  disbursement  of  loan \nproceeds  under  the  MFF,  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  Financial  management \nassessment conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Management and \nAnalysis of Projects25 has confirmed that the project executing and implementing agencies have \nconsiderable  experience  in  handling  similar  ADB-funded  projects  and  are  well  prepared  for \nfinancial management under the investment program.26 \n \n23. \nProcurement  of  civil  works  and  consulting  services.  All procurement of goods and \nworks  financed  wholly  or  in  part  by  ADB  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of civil works for construction of \nRRNMU  and  RCTRC  facilities  will  be  based  on  the  ADB  standard  bidding  document  for \nprocurement  of  works  (small  contracts).  For  the  road  construction,  the  investment  program \nstates will be following the national competitive bidding procurement process with the use of the \n\n                                                \n22 Few individual roads\u2014mostly those with higher capital costs related to more bridge and/or cross-drainage works \n(such roads may have other more pronounced benefits related to providing all-weather connectivity)\u2014have EIRRs \nbelow 10%. \n\n23 These benefits are a 25% decrease in transport cost during about 60 days of the rainy season, and increased crop \n\ndiversification and reduced spoilage resulting in an increase in agricultural revenue of 10%. \n\n24 The functions of SRRDAs are carried out by the State Road Board in Assam, State Rural Roads Agency in Odisha, \nState  Rural  Development  Agency  in  West  Bengal,  and  Rural  Roads  Development  Authority  in  Madhya  Pradesh \nand Chhattisgarh. \n\n25 ADB. 2005. Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n26 Financial management assessment was conducted in each investment program state in 2011.

All consultants financed by the loans \nunder the MFF will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements for recruitment of \nnational  consultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  Prior  ADB  review  for  the  recruitment  process  with \nquality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 will be followed. \n\n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n24. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  Government  of  India  and  state  governments.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nGender Impacts \n\nGender  analysis  highlighted  several  key  benefits  which \n\nD. \n \n25. \nThe investment program states are still lagging behind in terms of various development \nindicators.28 The  provision  of  all-weather  roads  in  rural  areas  will  be  a  key  factor  in  reducing \npoverty.  Specifically,  (i)  farmers  will  benefit  from  increased  access  to  rural  markets  and \nagricultural productivity contributing to increased incomes, (ii) rural communities will be able to \nshift  from  subsistence  farming  to  more  commercially  oriented  agricultural  production,  (iii) \nmainstreaming  of  production  of  high-value  perishable  products  will  become  possible,  (iv)  poor \nhouseholds  will  be  able  to  access  better-paying  jobs  outside  their  villages,  (v)  investments  in \nnonagricultural enterprises will grow at a faster pace, and (vi) the investment program itself will \ncreate labor opportunities for rural poor. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nthe  all-weather  roads \nconstructed  under  the  investment  program  will  bring,  including  an  increased  rate  of  safe  child \ndeliveries,  reduction  in  maternal  and  prenatal  deaths  and  the  mortality  of  children,  and \nincreased  enrollment  of  girls  in  schools  and  universities.  The  gender  action  plan  prepared  for \nproject  1  incorporates  several  gender  mainstreaming  targets,  including  (i)  participation  of  not \nless  than  30%  of  women  in  the  transect  walks;29 (ii)  participation  of  women  in  the  road  safety \nawareness  sessions  carried  out  for  affected  communities  under  the  community  participation \nframework  (CPF);  (iii)  at  least  10%  of  the  households  in  rural  habitations  to  be  connected  by \nproject  1  roads  will  be  headed  by  women,  and  at  least  40%  of  inhabitants  will  be  from \nvulnerable groups; (iv) at least 33% of and road maintenance will be done by  women; and (v) \nRCTRCs will develop and use gender-sensitive training modules. \n \nF. \n \nEnvironmental  impact.  Project  1  is  classified  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n27. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  In  line  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework (EARF),30 state initial environmental examinations (IEEs) of all road subprojects will \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n27 Approval of e-procurement for national competitive bidding in all investment program states was granted by ADB in \n\n2009\u20132011.  \n\n28 The number of people living below  the poverty line is  around  5.57 million in Assam, 9.10 million in Chhattisgarh, \n24.97 million in Madhya Pradesh, 17.85 million in Odisha, and 20.84 million in West Bengal (based on 2004\u20132005 \npoverty level estimates). \n\n29 Consultation with the affected communities conducted in the process of walking of the community representatives \ntogether with the representatives of project implementation units, project implementation consultant, panchayati raj \ninstitution, and design consultant along the alignment of the proposed rural road. \n\n30 Endorsed by the NRRDA following prior approval by each state government. \n\n\fland  acquisition.  Specific  procedural  requirements \n\nbe  prepared  before  each  tranche  approval;  IEEs  for  project  1  have  been  prepared  and  are \ndisclosed on the ADB website. Pursuant to provisions of the EARF, environmental assessment \nof non-road subprojects will be conducted during implementation of the MFF. The IEEs rate the \nscale  of  environment  impacts  from  the  physical  interventions  of  the  investment  program  as \nminor. 31 Mitigation  measures  for  all  impacts  have  been  developed  and  integrated  into \nconstruction works through incorporation of a standard environmental management plan (EMP) \nin the bidding documents and provision of road-specific EMPs with the detailed project reports. \nAssessment of institutional capacities and arrangements confirmed that they are satisfactory to \neffectively implement the requirements of the EARF, IEEs, and EMPs.32  \n \n28. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement;  Land  Availability.  Project  1  is  classified  category  C  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).The construction will be carried out \nmostly within existing rights-of-way, with widening and minor realignments in some cases, which \nwill  require  narrow  strips  of  land  to  be  made  available.  In  such  cases,  the  voluntary  land \ndonation  system  will  be  used  as  in  the  preceding  ADB  interventions  in  the  rural  road  sector \n(footnote 3). The system has been widely used under the PMGSY and other rural development \nschemes  across  India  and  has  been  proved  effective.  Projects  under  the  investment  program \nare not expected to involve involuntary resettlement and the government will ensure there is no \ninvoluntary \ninvolving  comprehensive \nconsultations with the communities are provided in the state specific CPFs, which are disclosed \non the ADB website. Transect walks conducted in the preparation of project 1 have confirmed \nthe  effectiveness  of the adopted  community consultation  and  social  impact  mitigation  process. \nAssessment of institutional capacities and arrangements confirmed that they are satisfactory to \neffectively implement the requirements of the CPFs.33 \n \n29. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Project  1  is  classified  category  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).The social assessment identified the presence of scheduled \ntribes in all investment program  states. However, these groups are largely assimilated into the \nlocal  population.  The  investment  program  will  not  have  any  differential  impact  on  scheduled \ntribes:  they  will  receive  similar  benefits  from  the  investment  program  to  those  received  by \nnonscheduled  tribe  households,  and  the  impact  on  tribal  and  cultural  identity  will  not  be \nsignificant. All outputs will be delivered in a culturally appropriate and participatory manner. To \nfurther mitigate the risks, the CPFs identify special provisions for all scheduled tribe households, \nensuring that their living standards are not adversely affected as a result of land donation or in \nthe event of any loss of non-land asset and impacts on their livelihoods. \n \nHIV/AIDS and other social safeguards. The social assessments done do not anticipate \n30. \nany  rise in  the  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  as  a  result  of  the  investment  program.  Each  investment \nprogram  state  will  ensure  that  works  contracts  follow  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  regulations \nand  include  provisions  requiring  contractors  to  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  for \nthose  employed  during  construction.  The  project  implementation  units  will  conduct  close \nmonitoring and, along with the contractors, will coordinate with the State AIDS Control Society \non conducting HIV/AIDS awareness programs. \n\n                                                \n31 The  predicted  environmental  impacts  are  minimal,  temporary,  and  reversible  as  they  are  mainly  related  to \noccupational  health  and  safety  and  minor  issues  of  dust,  noise,  and  water  pollution,  which  occur  mostly  during \nconstruction. \n\n32 Required capacity building of the contractors, PIUs, and PICs on environmental code of practice preparation and \nEMP  implementation  and  monitoring  will  be  organized  by  the  NRRDA  and  SRRDAs  with  technical  support  from \nADB, where necessary. \n\n33 Required  capacity  building  of  the  contractors,  PIU,  and  PIC  on  CPF  preparation  and  implementation  and \n\nmonitoring will be organized by the NRRDA and SRRDAs with technical support from ADB, where necessary. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nG. \n \n31.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  More  details  are \nprovided in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInitial delays in \nstart of civil \nworks \nInadequate road \nmaintenance \n\nSustainability of \nRRNMUs and \nRCTRCs \n\nMitigating Measures \nAdvance  action  for  procurement  will  be  used.  A  new  adopted  procedure  for  road  design  will \nminimize delays caused by design omissions. E-procurement adopted in each investment program \nstate will attract more bidders and promote competition, thus reducing rebidding. \nAll contracts will include 5-year post-construction road maintenance. Under PMGSY, MORD strictly \nenforces  the  inbuilt  mechanism  linking  release  of  central  funds  for  construction  with  provision  of \nadequate  maintenance  financing  by  the  states.  The  investment  program  will  further  increase  the \neffectiveness of the maintenance planning, budgeting, contracting, and administration. \nAll states have committed to (i) provide adequate staffing and budget for RCTRCs and RRNMUs, \nand normally (ii) not transfer key staff from the RRNMUs for at least 3 consecutive years; (iii) not \nleave  key  positions  vacant  for  more  than  30  days;  and  (iv)  not  transfer  more  than  one  key  staff \nmember  within  a  6-month  period.  The  consultants  (loan  financed  and  under  the  capacity \ndevelopment TA) will help support the rollout and knowledge transfer. \n\nMORD  =  Ministry  of  Rural  Development,  PMGSY  =  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Rural  Road  Program,  RCTRC  =  rural \nconnectivity training and research center, RRNMU = rural road network management unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n32. \nThe  Government  of  India  and  the  state  governments  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the investment program will conform to all applicable ADB policies including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n33. \nThe  Government  of  India  and  the  state  governments  have  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings  for  the  MFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  FFA.
