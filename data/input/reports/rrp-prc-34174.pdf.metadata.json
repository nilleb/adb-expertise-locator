In  2004,  the  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproduct  of  Sichuan  was  only  72%  of  the  national  average.  The \nProject  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  by  building  an \nimportant  section  of  the  western  region  corridor  connecting  two \ngrowth centers\u2014Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, and Kunming, \nthe  capital  of  Yunnan  Province\u2014by \n(i) constructing  an \nexpressway  across  mountainous  terrain;  (ii) improving  local \nroads  servicing  poor  counties  and  townships;  and  (iii) providing \nconsulting services and training to enhance capacity at the local \ncommunications  bureau,  construction  quality,  road  safety,  and \nproject monitoring and evaluation. \n \nDespite  considerable  investment  in  the  road  sector,  the  PRC \nroad  network  is  still  inadequate  and  does  not  provide  efficient \naccess  to  large  parts  of  the  country,  particularly  in  the  poorer \ninland  regions,  including  Sichuan.  Better  transport  links  are \nnecessary  to  improve  economic  efficiency,  foster  domestic  and \ninternational  trade,  facilitate  interregional  economic  integration, \nthereby  reducing \nand  promote  efficient  economic  growth, \npoverty.  Western  PRC \nroad \nlocal \nroad  network  comprising \ninfrastructure.  The \nexpressways  and  local  roads  must  therefore  be  developed  to \nspread  economic  and  social  benefits.  To  enhance  economic \ndevelopment  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  western  region,  the \nGovernment  is  implementing  the  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy.  The  strategy  aims  to  reduce  development  disparities \nbetween  the  western  and  coastal  regions.  The  Project  will \nsupport  this  strategy  by  developing  an  integrated  road  network \ncomprising expressways and local roads. The Sichuan provincial \ngovernment  (SPG)  has  identified  the  Project  as  a  priority \ninvestment,  which  will  link  up  with  an  ongoing  ADB-financed \nSouthern  Sichuan  Roads  Development  Project, \nthereby \nfacilitating completion of the 900-kilometer (km) route connecting \nChengdu and Kunming. \n \n\nlacks  high-class  and \n\nintegrated \n\n\fiv \n\nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nAllocation  and  Relending \nTerms \n\ntransport  system \n\nThe principal objective of the Project is to develop an integrated \nroad \nto  support  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment  in  Sichuan.  Local  roads  will  complement  the \nexpressway  in  bringing  benefits  to  rural  residents.  The  Project \nwill  (i)  reduce  traffic  accidents  and  vehicle  operating  costs;  (ii) \nimprove  access  between  Chengdu  and  Kunming;  (iii)  provide \nadditional transport capacity to accommodate growing traffic; (iv) \nimprove  access  to  jobs,  markets,  and  social  services;  and  (v) \ndevelop  the  capacity  of  local  communications  bureaus.  The \nProject  has  the  following  components:  (i)  construction  of  a  244 \nkm,  four-lane  access-controlled  toll  expressway  from  Ya\u2019an  to \nLugu,  including  access  roads,  interchanges  with  toll  stations, \ntunnels,  bridges,  administrative  stations,  and  service  areas;  (ii) \nupgrading  of  678  km  of  local  roads  to  improve  access  to  poor \nremote  areas,  and  roadside  stations;  (iii)  construction  of  four \npublic  transport  centers;  (iv)  procurement  of  equipment  for  road \nmaintenance,  toll  collection,  surveillance  and  communications, \ntunnel  operation  facilities,  vehicle  weigh  stations,  road  safety, \nand  office  administration;  (v)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement; \n(vi)  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  road  safety \naudit,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  capacity  building;  and  (v) \ndeveloping \nfor \nmaintenance. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$2,077 million equivalent, of which $931 million (45%) is in foreign \nexchange and $1,146 million equivalent (55%) in local currency. \n \n\nlocal  communications  bureaus\u2019  capacity \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nMinistry of Communications  \nSichuan Provincial Government  \nChina Development Bank  \n\nTotal \n% \n\nForeign \nExchange \n600.0 \n0.0 \n331.0 \n0.0 \n931.0 \n\n      45 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n0.0 \n272.4 \n328.7 \n544.9 \n1,146.0 \n       55 \n\n($ million)\nTotal \nCost \n\n600.0 \n272.4 \n659.7 \n544.9 \n2,077.0 \n\n     100 \n\nA $600 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.

Civil  works \nfor  the  expressway  and  local  roads  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  On  11  March  2005,  ADB \napproved advance action for procurement of civil works. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  66  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  to  (i) help  with  project  management  during \nconstruction; \ntunnel  and  bridge \nconstruction; (iii) conduct a safety audit of the project design, and \nmake  safety  recommendations  on  the  completed  construction \nworks; (iv) help set up and implement quality control procedures; \n(v) monitor  the  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  and  provide \nguidance  on  environmental  mitigation  measures  as  well  as  help \ndevelop  capacity  in  vehicle  emissions;  (vi) help  formulate  a \ncapacity  development  program;  and  (vii) help  establish  and \nimplement a project performance management system. The team \nleader  will  be  in  the  field  during  construction  and  will  act  as \nassistant  chief  supervision  engineer, \nthe  chief \nsupervision engineer certify variation orders, contractor\u2019s monthly \npayments,  and  subcontracting  documents;  and \n(ii) helping \nestablish  a  contract  management  system.  All  consultants  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged \nbased  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers.  The  domestic \nconsultants  for  construction  supervision  will  be  financed  by \nSPCD  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  government \nprocedures. \n \nBy  developing  an  integrated  expressway  and  complementary \nlocal  road  network,  the  Project  will  help  improve  access  to \nmarkets  and  social  services  for  the  rural  poor  residents  in  the \nproject  area.  The  Project  will  reduce  transport  time  and  costs, \nand  thereby  encourage  investment,  create  jobs,  and  increase \nincomes.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is \nestimated  at  15.2%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nexpressway  component  is  5.4%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real \n\n(i) helping \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvi \n\n \n \n\n \n\ntransport,  and \n\ntransport  operators  and \n\nweighted average cost of capital. There are 273,000 poor people, \nor 29% of the total population in the project area, living below the \nincome  levels  of  CNY900  per  year  in  rural  areas  and  minimum \nliving standards in urban areas. The main project beneficiaries of \nthe local road component will be households in poor counties and \ntownships  in  the  project  area,  providers  of  rural  transport, \nindustrial  and  agricultural  businesses,  agriculture-based \nhouseholds  producing  grains  and  vegetables  for  local  markets, \npeople  living  in  the  project  area  who  will  have  easier  access  to \nlong-distance \ntheir \ncustomers  for  transit  traffic.  The  Project  will  also  help  reduce \ntraffic  accidents,  vehicle  emissions,  and  traffic  noise  on  the \nexisting roads. \n \nThe  Project  was  formulated  to  keep  to  a  minimum  the  potential \ntechnical, safety, economic, financial, and resettlement risks. The \nmain technical risks, which could result in implementation delays \nand  cost  overruns,  are  associated  with  the  tunnels  (34.5  km  in \ntotal)  and  bridges  (64.0  km  in  total).  To  mitigate  the  risks, \ninternational  consultants  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and \nconstruction  methods.  Prequalification  of  contractors  focuses  on \ntheir financial and technical capability in handling complex works. \nDuring  construction,  monitoring  and  contract  management \ninformation  systems  will  be  set  up  and  implemented,  with  the \ntimely \nassistance  of \nfor \nidentification  of \nimplementation  of \ncorrective  measures.  Given  the  safety  hazards  associated  with \nbridge  works,  the  contractors  will  be  required  to  strictly  enforce \nworking  safety  rules  and  measures.  SPCD  has  experience  and \nhas \nimplementing \ninternationally financed projects. \n \nEconomic performance in the project-influenced area would have \nto  deteriorate  substantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic \nviability.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and \noperation  of \nthe  actual \nthe  expressway  will  depend  on \nconstruction  costs,  ability  of  the  commercial  management,  and \nappropriate  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  the  Project \nCompany  will  build  up  a  commercial  business  environment  for \nexpressway  operations,  the  project  expressway  will  receive \nsubstantial  equity  from  the  central  and  provincial  governments, \nand  an  appropriate  toll  structure  will  be  adopted.  Appropriate \ncoordination  and  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  to \nmitigate resettlement risks. The social risks include resettlement, \nimmunodeficiency \nhuman \nsyndrome  infection,  and  ethnic  minority  communities  associated \nwith the Project. Appropriate mitigation measures are in place in \nthe  resettlement  plan,  the  ethnic  minorities  development  plan, \nand the social action development plan. \n\nthe \ntechnical  problems  and \n\nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \n\ninternational  consultants, \n\nperformance \n\nsatisfactory \n\nshown \n\nin \n\n\f\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \n\n \n1. \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Central Sichuan Roads Development Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC\u2019s economic growth since the 1980s has substantially increased the demand for \ntransport services. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing diversification have altered \nthe  pattern  of  transport  demand.  The  demand  for  road  transport  has  outpaced  that  of  other \ntransport  modes.  There  is  a  rapidly  increasing  movement  of  goods  and  passengers  by  road, \nwhich is more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a market economy. The \nshift  in  transport  demand  also  reflects  the  loosening  of  anticompetitive  restrictions  in  the  road \ntransport  industry  itself.  From  1990  to  2004,  road  traffic  grew  by  9.0%  per  annum  (p.a.)  for \npassenger traffic, reaching 876.5 billion passenger-kilometers (km); and by 6.0% p.a. for freight, \nreaching  759.7  billion  ton-km.  In  Sichuan,  road  traffic  grew  by  6.5%  p.a.  for  passenger  traffic, \nreaching 51.7 billion passenger-km, and by 4.2% p.a. for freight, reaching 27.2 billion ton-km. In \n2004, road traffic accounted for 53.7% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.4% of the \ntotal freight traffic while the corresponding figures for Sichuan Province were 76.0% and 26.3%. \nThe  vehicle  fleet  will  continue  to  expand  with  the  country\u2019s  rapid  economic  growth,  low  vehicle \nownership  rates,  lower  automobile  prices  after  World  Trade  Organization  accession,  increasing \naccess  to  loans  to  finance  automobile  purchases,  and  large  investment  in  automotive \nmanufacturing. \n \n3. \nTo  meet  the  growing  demand  for  improved  transport  infrastructure  and  services,  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy for the road sector, as reflected in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), calls \nfor (i) accelerating the construction of the network of highways and national roads, with a focus on \nfive north\u2013south and seven east\u2013west sections of the national trunk highway system; (ii) starting \nconstruction  of  eight  new  highways  for  18,000  km  in  the  western  region;  (iii) by  2005,  opening \napproximately 1.95 million km of highways to traffic, with expressways1 accounting for 35,000 km; \nand  (iv)  starting  the  national  expressway  network  plan  to  complete  85,000  km  by  2040  with \nannual investment of CNY100 billion\u2013150 billion. \n \n4. \nWhile the national trunk highway system is being developed, accessibility in most of rural \nPRC is still low: 145 townships and 50,124 villages, most in the western region, have no access \nto  all-weather  roads.  Many  townships  and  villages  still  depend  on  earth  tracks  that  are  not \nsuitable  for  motorized  traffic  and  become  impassable  during  the  rainy  season.  Even  where  all-\nweather roads have been built, the standard of rural roads is low, maintenance is poor, and many \nroads  need  rehabilitation.  The  central  Government  thus  completed  71,000  km  of  rural  roads  at \nthe  cost  of  CNY60.9  billion,  supported  by  the  local  governments  that  constructed  68,000  km, \ncosting  CNY57.6  billion,  in  2004.  The  Government  targets  developing  a  road  network  that  will \nreach 99.8% of townships by 2005. The Government plans to invest CNY100 billion in developing \nrural  roads  during  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010).  By  2010,  all  villages  in  the  eastern \nregion will be linked with paved roads, and the same targets will be applied to 80% villages in the \ncentral  region  and  90%  towns  in  the  western  region.  In  2003,  the  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (SPCD)  prepared  the  Sichuan  Province  Rural  Road  Development \n\n                                                           \n1  The PRC had 34,200 km of expressways in 2004, second only to the United States. \n\n\fimproved  roads  as  an \n\nPlan  2020.  By  the  end  of  2005,  SPCD  plans  to  construct  2,059  km  of  roads  to  50  townships \nwithout road access, as well as 25,908 km for 5,261 villages and, by the end of 2010, 8,500 km \nand  32,000  km,  respectively.  In  the  project  area,  the  plan  aims  to  improve  1,500  km  of  the \nsecondary  and  tertiary  network  by  2010.  These  major  programs  by  the  central  and  local \ngovernments will be a pro-poor initiative; surveys during the feasibility study showed that the poor \npeople  highly  ranked \ninfrastructure  development  priority.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  reducing  poverty  through  transport  infrastructure  investment  is \nreflected  in  the  poverty  partnership  agreement  between  the  Government  and  ADB.2 The  main \nfeatures  of  the  proposed  Project  are  summarized  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \n(Appendix 1). \n \n5. \nThe  significant  road  sector  development  during  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan  (1996\u20132000) \nresulted in road investments totaling CNY924 billion, or CNY185 billion per year. The road sector \ninvestment  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  16%.  During  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan,  the  total \ninvestment  is  expected  to  reach  about  CNY1,800  billion,  almost  double  that  in  the  previous  5 \nyears.  In  line  with  the  increase  in  investment,  the  PRC\u2019s  road  network  expanded  to \n1.86 million km in 2004, an increase of 46,000 km from 2003. The vehicle fleet totaled 24 million \ntrucks,  cars,  and  buses,  and  72 million  other  motorized  vehicles  (motorcycles  and  agricultural \nvehicles).  Details  of  a  road  sector  analysis  are  in  Appendix 2.  SPCD  invested  about  CNY16.2 \nbillion  in  the  road  sector  in  2004,  of  which  CNY12.9  billion  was  allocated  to  construction  and \nCNY1.4  billion  to  maintenance.  During  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan,  road  investment  is  expected to \nbe about CNY71 billion. SPCD plans to increase the road investment to CNY78 billion during the \n11th Five-Year Plan (Appendix 3). \n \nB. \n \n6. \nSichuan  is  in  southwestern  PRC,  surrounded  by  mountains.  Its  isolation  has  been \nreduced by improved navigation on the Yangtze River, railway construction, and the construction \nof several major highways. Most of the population is concentrated on the flat, fertile plain in the \neast and central east, but the province contains several poverty-stricken areas in its mountainous \nperiphery, where the Project is located. Despite rapid development in recent years, Sichuan ranks \nseventh lowest of all provinces in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita: CNY7,514 in \n2004, or 72% of the national average. The per capita rural income was CNY2,580, or 88% of the \nnational  average.  About  one  third  of  the  counties  are  officially  designated  as  poor.  There  are \n282,500 poor people in the project area, equivalent to 29% of the total population, living below the \nincome levels of CNY900 per year in rural areas and the minimum living standards in urban areas. \n \n7. \nBased on the findings of the feasibility study under an ADB-financed technical assistance \n(TA), 3  one  reason  for  high  poverty  is  slow  economic  growth,  partly  because  of  inadequate \ninfrastructure. Despite the considerable investments, the road network in the project area is still \ninadequate and does not provide efficient transport access to markets and social services such \nas  education  and  health.  Around  30%  of  villages  in  Hanyuan  and  Mianning  still  have  no  road \naccess. Over the whole project area, over 60% of villages have paved road access but only one \nthird have bus services. The proportions in Shimian and Mianning are much lower, with under a \nquarter of villages having paved road access and less than 20% having bus services. In the last 3 \nyears,  local  governments  have  improved  access  to  13  townships  (10%  of  the  total)  and  29 \nvillages  (4%).  These  road  improvements  have  led  to  the  provision  of  bus  services  to  these \n                                                           \n2  Available at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Poverty/pa_prc.pdf. \n3  ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\ncommunities.  Bus  services  are  a  vital  element  in  the  rural  transport  system  of  the  project  area \ndue to low vehicle ownership. Despite these improvements, the quality of access to many villages \nremains  unsatisfactory,  with  low-standard  and  poorly  maintained  roads  often  susceptible  to \nclosure due to landslides, flooding, and snow falls. Bus service to townships off the main roads is \ninfrequent,  with  about  only  three  or  four  trips  per  day.  Between  villages  and  townships,  small \nbuses operate where road conditions permit, but travel is mostly by small truck, foot, or horse. \n \n8. \nThe impact of road investments on poverty reduction is supported by the results of studies \nand evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB4 and the World Bank.5 Well-\nintegrated  road  development  helps  ensure  that  the  benefits  derived  from  the  expressway  filter \ndown to the poor. Benefits from transport cost savings and time savings, along with an increase \nin incomes, will be passed on through the transport chain to townships and villages. These results \naffirm  the  relevance  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  PRC  road  sector.  A  TA6 will  help  the  Government \nformulate  a  road  network  strategy  that  better  integrates  expressways  and  local  roads  to  meet \ncommunities\u2019 needs and support economic growth, and that provides road agencies with cross-\ndisciplinary skills and tools through capacity building. A case study in Shaanxi Province found that \nimproved roads were correlated with poverty reduction, and that (i) 3.2 poor people are lifted out \nof poverty for every CNY10,000 invested in roads; and (ii) for every 1% increase in kilometer of \nroad  per  capita,  household  consumption  increases  by  0.08%. 7  Benefits  for  rural  poor  areas \ninclude  lower  transport  costs;  lower  cost  of  inputs;  expanded  agricultural  support  services; \nimproved farming practices; greater access to urban jobs; and better access to health, education, \nand social services.8 \n \n9. \nTo help the Government develop its road sector strategy and investment projects, external \nassistance  has  been  provided  mainly  from  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation \n(JBIC), and the World Bank (Appendix 4). Since 1991, ADB has provided 30 loans, totaling nearly \n$5.6 billion, to finance about 4,100 km of expressways, together with 7,600 km of associated local \nroad networks. Since 1995, local roads have been included in the scope of road projects to make \nADB\u2019s  interventions  in  the  road  sector  more  pro-poor.  Of  the  ADB-financed  projects,  18  have \nbeen completed and are open to traffic. ADB has also provided 50 TAs, totaling $26.9 million, to \nthe  road  sector.  The  advisory  TAs  have  addressed  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety, 9 human  resource  development, \ntransport pricing, commercialization and corporatization, and the mobilization of private financial \nresources.  The  World  Bank  and  JBIC  have  provided  about  $6.6  billion  and  \u00a5219  billion, \n\n                                                           \n4  In  Liaoning  and  Yunnan  provinces,  construction  of  expressways  complemented  by  upgrading  local  roads  was \nassociated with a significant increase in rural incomes in the project area (ADB. 2000.

Each \nmajor  development  partner  focuses  on  different  corridors,  while  information  related  to  policy \nadvice is shared across the development community. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nIntegrated Design and ADB Financing of the Local Road Component. The rural poor \nhave limited mobility beyond their immediate communities because of their geographical isolation \nand  the  high  cost  of  motorized  transport.  As  a  result,  they  generally  view  local  roads  as  a  key \ninfrastructure investment priority. Benefits for poor rural areas include lower transport costs, lower \ncost of inputs, expanded agricultural support services, and therefore improved farming practices, \ngreater access to urban jobs and to health, education, and social services. Better roads promote \nthe  transition  from  a  subsistence  farming  rural  economy  to  a  cash  crop  and  more  diversified \neconomy with a higher and more stable income flow to rural households, reducing poverty. Better \nintegration  of  the  local  roads  into  the  trunk  highway  system  will  help  bring  benefits  to  the  poor \nmore effectively. \n \n11. \nThe  dialogue  with  the  Government  focused  on  the  need  to  integrate  the  local  road \ncomponent  into  the  project  scope  with  ADB\u2019s  financing  to  establish  a  credible  linkage  between \npoverty reduction and ADB\u2019s assistance based on the experience of the ongoing and completed \nADB-financed  road  projects  since  1995.10 The  Government  agreed  to  integrate  the  local  road \ncomponent  with  ADB\u2019s  financing;  the  component  comprised  678  km  (Appendix  5),  which  was \nselected on the basis of population density, poverty incidence, and road network efficiency from \nthe Sichuan Provincial Rural Road Development Plan. These roads are in poor condition and are \nnot passable during the rainy season. Upon completion, they will connect the main trunk highway \nand  the  poor  or  minority  townships  and  villages  in  the  Project\u2019s  hinterland.  The  Project  will \nupgrade  the  roads  to  higher  road  class,  costing  $68.8  million,  of  which  $17.5  million  will  be \nfinanced from the ADB loan. The local road component, together with the expressway, will serve \n938,930  people  in  the  project  area,  of  whom  about  273,000,  or  29%,  are  poor,  living  on  under \nCNY900  per  capita  per  year  in  rural  areas  and  below  the  minimum  living  standards  in  urban \nareas. The component will (i) be implemented concurrently with the expressway component and \nmaintained  by  the  county  governments  under  the  guidance  of  SPCD,11 (ii) use  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications (MOC) technical designs and standards, and (iii) be monitored and evaluated to \nensure that its poverty impacts are enhanced.12 \n \n12. \nCorporate  Governance.  In  Sichuan,  expressway  construction  and  operation  were \nseparated  from  the  provincial  government  under  previous  ADB-financed  road  projects.  This \ncorporatization has promoted corporate governance and improved operational efficiency. SPCD \nhas  established  an  expressway  company  (the  Project  Company),  which  will  be  responsible  for \nconstruction and operations of the project expressway. It will be entitled to collect tolls and retain \ntoll revenue and will repay the proposed loan. SPCD and the Project Company will enter into a \n\n                                                           \n10 Since 1995, the scope of the 20 ADB-financed road projects has been expanded to enhance their impacts on poverty \nreduction by integrating local road improvements to benefit poor communities. The local road components of these \nprojects are being implemented or have been completed successfully, helping improve living standards of the poor in \nthe project area. \n\n11 Road maintenance expenditures in Sichuan have increased at 4\u20136% per annum, reaching CNY1.42 billion in 2004. \n\nWhile road maintenance is generally good, it must be improved, particularly for low-class roads. \n\n12 While  improving  infrastructure  is  important,  competition  in  providing  road  transport  services  is  also  important  to \n\nensure that some of the savings in transport costs are passed onto local farmers as reduced tariff. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nconcession  framework  agreement 13  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  by  31  December  2007  to \nensure  autonomy  of  operations,  encourage  the  establishment  of  road  performance  indicators, \nand facilitate refinancing of road sector assets. SPCD will prepare a corporate development plan \nby 31 December 2007 to assure high standards of corporate governance, management practices, \nand  financial  reporting.  These  agreements  and  plans  will  be  implemented  with  the  help  of  the \nloan-financed  consultants  during  project  implementation.  The  corporatization  process  will  be \nguided by the model documents14 developed under ADB-financed TA.15 To help with the process \nof corporatization, training will be provided under the loan to the staff of the Project Company. \n \n13. \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  In  the  PRC,  the  private  sector  has  been  involved  in  the \nroad  sector  through  cooperative  joint  ventures,  securitization  through  initial  public  offerings, \nrevenue bond financing, involving the sale of rated notes backed by a pledge of an entity\u2019s cash-\nflow sources, and a build-operate-transfer method (Supplementary Appendix B). For this Project, \nin  line  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy, 16 consideration  was  given  to  various \napproaches  to  highway  financing  recommended  under  an  ADB-financed  TA  (footnote  15), \nincluding  securitization. 17  The  options  for  financing  the  project  expressway  were  examined. \nCapacity  to  attract  private  financing,  particularly  equity  capital,  for  road  projects  such  as  the \nproject  expressway\u2014with  low  initial  demand  and  low  financial  returns  but  high  long-term \neconomic returns\u2014is limited. Therefore, project construction will be financed from public sources. \nPrivate  sector  financing  options,  including  contracting  out  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  to \nthe  private  sector,  will  be  examined  before  operations  start.  ADB  will  favorably  consider  such \nrefinancing  for  the  Project,  provided  that  advance  notice  is  received  and  the  proposal  meets \nADB\u2019s  standards  of  good  governance,  transparency,  and  project  viability.  SPCD  involved  the \nprivate sector for four expressways,18 raising about CNY4 billion during 1997 and 2001, including \nsecuritization of the Chengdu\u2013Chongqing expressway on the Hong Kong, China, stock exchange. \n \n14. \nRoad Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC, including Sichuan. In 2004, there \nwere  567,753  road  accidents,  involving  451,810  injuries  and  99,217  fatalities,  or  41  deaths  per \n10,000  vehicles,  which  is  very  high  by  international  standards. 19 In  2004,  there  were  28,484 \nreported accidents, with 4,890 fatalities and 28,218 injuries. The Ministry of Public Security, which \nis responsible for enforcement of traffic laws and regulations, is committed to reducing accidents \nthrough improved safety of vehicles, driver training, and improved traffic management. The road \ntraffic safety law was made effective in May 2004, with the help of an ADB-financed TA. 20 Also in \nMay  2004,  an  interministerial  committee,  coordinated  by  MOC,  involving  15  ministries  and \n                                                           \n13 The  main  objective  of  the  concession  framework  agreement  is  related  to  the  operation  phase  of  the  Project,  so \n\nconstruction may start before the agreement is finalized. \n\n14 Available: http://www.chineseinfrastructure.com. \n15 ADB. 1997.

Under \nthe  Project,  the  Sichuan  Expressway  Traffic  Police  will  establish  a  team  to  patrol  the  new \nexpressway, enforce traffic regulations, and maintain smooth traffic flow. To address road safety \nissues, the Project will include the following: (i) vehicle-weighing stations; (ii) road safety training \nfor  staff  of  SPCD;  (iii)  safety  audit  during  design  and  construction;  (iv)  public  awareness  and \neducation campaigns, and accident prevention; and (v) a traffic enforcement program. These will \nbe  carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  a  road  safety  specialist  financed  under  the  loan \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n15. \nVehicle  Emissions. With the rapid increase in vehicle ownership, vehicle emissions will \ndamage the environment if mitigation measures are not taken. Fragmented responsibility, lack of \ninterdepartmental coordination, and an inadequate database and monitoring system prevent the \nformulation of specific targets for a reduction in vehicle emissions. With assistance from transport \nagencies and the Public Security Bureau, the Sichuan Environment Protection Bureau conducts \nvehicle emission testing and random spot checks. The emission and safety check is mandatory \nfor all motor vehicles registered in the province. All buses and public taxis in Chengdu are now \npowered by compressed natural gas (CNG). More CNG filling stations are being built throughout \nthe urban areas of the province. SPCD is committed to controlling vehicle emissions. International \nconsultants  will  provide  an  action  plan  and  training  to  control  vehicle  emissions  in  the  project \narea,  in  light  of  the  findings  of  the  ADB-financed  TA 22 on  vehicle  emissions  (Supplementary \nAppendix C). \n \nD. \n \nSPCD  has  prepared  and  implemented  three  internationally  financed  road  projects23 well \n16. \nand  without  major  problems.  The  safeguard  policies  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement, \nand  indigenous  people  have  been  met.  Lessons  learned  from  the  Chengdu\u2013Nanchong \nexpressway  project24 include  the  need  for  (i)  conducting  more  detailed  geological  investigations \nbefore finalizing bidding documents; (ii) integrating the local road component into the expressway \ndevelopment to enhance poverty impact; (iii) drawing up a detailed resettlement plan, which should \nbe  updated  after  a  detailed  measurement  survey,  to  effectively  assess  its  implementation;  (iv) \nseparating  expressway  construction  and  operations  from  the  provincial  government  function  to \nimprove  corporate  governance;  and  (v)  strengthening  local  communications  bureaus  for  road \nmaintenance.  These  lessons  were  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Government  and  SPCD  and \nreflected in the project design. \n \nPerformance  reviews25 of  completed  ADB-financed  road  projects  elsewhere  in  the  PRC \n17. \nindicate  that,  in  general,  the  projects  facilitated  economic  growth  and  reduced  poverty  as \nenvisaged during project preparation.

Project \ncompletion  reports  prepared  for  16  road  projects  concluded  that  15  were  highly  or  generally \nsuccessful and 1 partly successful.27 The project performance audit reports for four road projects \nrated  the  projects  as  either  highly  successful  or  successful.  The  lessons  learned  from  ADB-\nfinanced  road  projects  are  reflected  in  the  project  design.  A  development  impact  study28 of  the \n1,867 km Beijing\u2013Tongjiang expressway route, for which ADB provided loans totaling $1.2 billion, \nshowed that the improved road network significantly helped develop northeastern PRC. Lessons \nfrom  these  projects  have  been  brought  to  the  attention  of  SPCD,  particularly  with  reference  to \nimplementation.  To  avoid  delayed  loan  effectiveness  caused  by  delays  in  procurement,  a \ntendering  company  has  been  recruited  to  prequalify  the  civil  works  contractors.  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines and requirements were discussed extensively during missions. Emphasis \nwas  put  on  the  need  to  (i) strictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii) evaluate  bids \naccording to ADB-approved evaluation criteria, and (iii) clearly substantiate the conclusions of the \nbid evaluation. \n \nE. \n \nADB's  operational  strategy 29 in  the  road  sector  supports  (i) construction  of  roads  that \n18. \nconnect major growth centers and link the hinterland economies; (ii) integration of the network so \nthat the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, particularly those \nthat  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii) promotion  of  road  safety  and  reduction  of  vehicle \nemissions; (iv) institutional strengthening to increase the commercial orientation and efficiency of \nexpressway  organizations;  (v) improvement  of  highway  planning  and  evaluation  techniques; \n(vi) adoption of pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; and (vii) use of \nalternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector  participation.  ADB  road \nsector  assistance  targets  the  less  developed  central  and  western  provinces,  where  most  of  the \npoor  live.  The  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  development  priorities  and  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy. \n \n19. \nDespite  the  considerable  investments  in  the  road  sector,  the  PRC  road  network  is  still \ninadequate and does not provide efficient transport to large parts of the country, particularly in the \npoorer inland regions, including Sichuan. Better transport links are necessary to improve economic \nefficiency,  foster  domestic  and  international  trade,  facilitate  interregional  integration,  and  reduce \npoverty. Western PRC lacks high-class road infrastructure in and outside the region, and between \nand  within  provinces  in  the  region.  The  road  network  must  be  developed  to  facilitate  sustainable \neconomic development and ensure that investments impact poor areas and rural residents in the \n\nRationale \n\n                                                           \n26 ADB.  1998.

To  enhance  economic \ndevelopment  and  reduce  poverty  in  western  PRC,  the  Government  is  implementing  the  Western \nRegion  Development  Strategy,  which  is  the  key  theme  of  the  10th  and  11th  5-year  plans.  \nThe  strategy  aims  to  reduce  development  disparities  between  the  western  and  coastal  regions.  \nThe Project will support this strategy. It will be the third road project for ADB financing in Sichuan. \nThe first one has been successfully completed and the second one is under implementation. \n \n20. \nDuring the 2005 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study was completed by SPCD in December 2002. \nAn environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared in December 2004, and a resettlement \nplan  in  November  2004.  ADB  provided  TA  (footnote  3)  to  supplement  the  government  studies. \nFact-finding  was  undertaken  from  24  January  to  3  February  2005,  and  appraisal  from  14  to  22 \nMarch  2005.  The  Project  was  formulated  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  ADB  missions, \ninformation  provided  by  the  Government,  stakeholder  consultations,  discussions  with  other \nfunding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nto \n\nOutputs \n\nthe  capacity  of \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\njobs,  markets,  and  social  services;  and  (v)  develop \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  will  develop  an  integrated  road  transport  system  to  support  sustainable \n21. \neconomic  development  in  Sichuan.  Local  roads  will  complement  the  expressway  in  bringing \nbenefits to rural residents. The Project will (i) reduce traffic accidents and vehicle operating costs; \n(ii)  improve  access  between  Chengdu  and  Kunming,  two  major  growth  centers  in  southwestern \nPRC;  (iii)  provide  additional  transport  capacity  to  accommodate  growing  traffic;  (iv)  improve \naccess \nlocal \ncommunications bureaus. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe Project integrates the expressway and local roads in its design to benefit townships \nand  villages.  The  Project  has  the  following  components:  (i)  construction  of  a  244  km,  four-lane \naccess-controlled toll expressway from Ya\u2019an to Lugu, including access roads, interchanges with \ntoll stations, tunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) upgrading of 678 km \nof local roads to improve access to poor remote areas, and roadside stations; (iii) rehabilitation of \nfour public transport centers; (iv) procurement of equipment for road maintenance, toll collection, \nsurveillance and communications, tunnel operation facilities, vehicle weigh stations, road safety, \nand  office  administration;  (v)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (vi)  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision, road safety audit, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building; and \n(v) developing capacity of local communications bureaus for maintenance. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nPublic  Transport  Center.  Because  of  the  poor  road  infrastructure  in  the  project  area, \npublic  transport  service  is  inadequate,  given  the  limited  routes  and  bus  service  in  remote  poor \nareas. Many towns and villages with poor or no road access still have no direct bus service. For \nexample, only 63% of towns are served by bus in Mianning county. Bus service in villages is even \nmore limited, from 17% in Mianning to 50% in Hanyuan county. No cross-county routes provide \ndirect connections across township boundaries without going through township centers. In order \nto  provide  poor,  remote  areas  with  better  public  transport  services,  Sichuan  plans  to  develop  9 \nprovincial  public  transport  centers  by  2015,  with  90  county  public  transport  centers,  including \n\nSpecial Features \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nrehabilitation  of  4  that  are  included  in  the  Project.  Each  center  will  have  a  handling  capacity  of \n5,000  passengers  per  day,  enable  longer  public  transport  routes  that  can  reach  towns  and \nvillages, improve the quality of service, reduce costs to users, and ensure more efficient use of \nbus fleet. An assessment of transport services is in Appendix 6. \n \nIntelligent  Transport  System.  An  intelligent  transport  system (ITS)30 on  expressways  is \n24. \nbeing  introduced  in  accordance  with  the  national  ITS  architecture  prepared  by  the  National  ITS \nCenter.  In  Sichuan,  an  expressway  ITS  policy  is  being  drafted  to  (i)  introduce  a  network-wide \nexpressway  tolling system;  (ii)  reduce  toll  payment  delay;  (iii)  improve  safety  through  enhanced \nmonitoring;  (iv)  improve  traveler  information;  (iv)  assist  in  emergencies;  and  (v)  improve  traffic \nenforcement,  infrastructure  maintenance,  and  computerized  management  of  urgent  incidents. \nThe use of an ITS will be built into the Project through procurement of equipment and training and \nwill  be  implemented  with  the  help  of  the  international  consultants.  ITS  includes  (i)  fewer  traffic \ncontrol  centers;  (ii)  advanced  toll  payment;  (iii)  variable  message  displays  to  improve  driver \ninformation;  (iv)  use  of  surveillance  technology;  and  (v)  detection  of  blackspot  locations  and \nweather conditions; (vi) monitoring of speed limit, overloaded vehicles, and toll payment; and (v) \nprovision of current information to improve road safety (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n25. \nAsset  Management.  Expressway  companies  in  Sichuan  do  not  make  significant  use  of \nmodern  techniques  in  their  asset  management  and  road  maintenance  programs.  The  Project \nCompany will use a computerized database, which will have the following merits: (i) more robust \ndecision  making  based  on  a  greater  pool  of  data,  (ii)  the  ability  to  share  information  and \nexperiences with external agencies, (iii) enhance professional skills, and (iv) better information to \nencourage  policy  makers  to  prioritize  asset  management  and  maintenance.  A  number  of \nmeasures  will  be  introduced  with  the  help  of  the  international  consultants  to  facilitate \nimplementation.  They  will  meet  three  strategic  objectives:  (i)  almost  immediate:  measures  for \nimplementation  when  the  Project  Company\u2019s  organizational  structure  is  put  in  place;  (ii)  short \nterm:  measures  for  implementation  before  expressway  completion;  and  (iii)  medium  term: \nmeasures for implementation within the first 2\u20133 years of expressway operations (Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \n26. \nRoadside  Stations.  Road  projects  have  traditionally  focused  on  expanding  transport \ncapacity  to  maximize  economic  impact.  Achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  by \ndeveloping \nthe  multisector  and \nmultipurpose  dimensions  of  infrastructure  investment.  The  Project\u2019s  roadside  stations31 will  link \nroads with community activities and encourage safe driving. Roadside stations normally provide \nparking areas and ancillary facilities such as bus terminals; gasoline stations; information centers \nabout roads, road safety, and tourism; local specialty markets; restaurants; and agro-processing \nfacilities.  Details  of  facilities  will  be  firmed  up  during  project  implementation.  The  Project  will \ndevelop roadside stations along the project local roads. \n \n\ninnovative  approaches \n\ntransport  requires \n\nthat  enhance \n\n                                                           \n30 The application of the information technology to transport is referred to as ITS, which provides the ability to gather, \norganize,  analyze,  use,  and  share  information  about  transport  systems  and  their  efficient  use.  ITS  for  developing \ncountries was prepared by the World Bank (World Bank. 2004. ITS for Developing Countries. ITS Technical Note 1. \nWashington, DC) and will be used as a guide. \n\n31 The  concept  of  roadside  stations  was  developed  in  Japan  to  link  road  users  and  communities,  thereby  facilitating \nlocal economic development. They are different from ordinary service areas because they (i) are designed with the \ninvolvement  of  local  communities;  (ii) link  road  users  and  local  communities;  (iii) provide  business  opportunities  for \nlocal people; and (iv) can provide possible public services, including health care, education, and cultural activities, in \naddition to the normal restaurant and commercial services. SPCD will use the World Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Roadside \nStations. \n\n \n\n\fStakeholder Consultations. During the feasibility study, EIA, resettlement planning, and \n27. \nTA implementation, consultations were conducted with 4,200 representatives of local government \nagencies, civil society, and project-affected people to discuss project alternatives, environmental \nconcerns,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues,  and  economic  development  potential.  The \nconsultations indicated that local residents supported the Project because they would have better \naccess  to  jobs,  markets,  and  social  services.  These  processes  enabled  local  stakeholders  to \nexpress their opinions, including on alignment selection, resettlement, and compensation, and to \nmake suggestions to improve project design and implementation (Appendix 7). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $2,077 million, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$931  million  (45%)  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $1,146  million  (55%).  The  total  costs  include \nphysical contingencies, price contingencies, and interest and other charges during construction. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 8. \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n1.

The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 6 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan will finance about 64% of \nthe foreign exchange cost of the Project and 29% of the total project cost. The remaining foreign \nexchange  cost  will  be  financed  by  the  Sichuan  provincial  government  (SPG).  The  local  currency \ncost will be financed by MOC, SPG, and cofinancing through a loan from the China Development \nBank,  which  has  issued  a  commitment  letter  to  SPCD.  MOC  and  SPG  have  made  budgetary \nprovisions for the counterpart funds. The loan from the China Development Bank is repayable over \n26 years, including a grace period of 6 years, and at a lending rate at 5.76% per annum. The ADB \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nloan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  SPG,  and  through  SPG,  to  the  Project  Company  on  the \nsame financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan.

The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  6  years,  from \n\n \nF. \n \n30. \nProject Management. As the Executing Agency, SPCD will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation of the Project. Part of SPCD has been corporatized to form the Project Company \nto be the Project\u2019s Implementing Agency. A project director will be responsible for overall project \nmanagement, approval of contracts, and payments while a project manager is responsible for the \ndaily physical implementation and for the preparation of progress reports. The Project Company \nwill have sufficient technical capability to handle the Project as its engineers will have experience \nin implementing internationally financed road projects. The financial management assessment of \nSPCD shows that the Project will have in place an adequate financial management system. The \nfinancial management assessment questionnaire (Supplementary Appendix E) was completed by \nthe  SPCD.  Organization  charts  for  SPCD  and  the  Project  Company  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \n31. \nApril 2006 to September 2011 (Appendix 9). \n \n32. \nProcurement. All ADB-financed procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The civil works for the expressway and the local roads will be divided \ninto 20 packages to be procured through international competitive bidding. Equipment packages \nwill be procured under domestic financing through local competitive bidding for traffic engineering, \ntunnel  monitoring  and  emergency  systems,  communications  and  toll  plaza  systems,  and  road \nmaintenance.  Ancillary  buildings,  and  facilities  and  roadside  greening  will  be  procured  through \nlocal  competitive  bidding  using  domestic  financing  (Appendix  10).  A  well-qualified  tendering \ncompany will handle international competitive bidding. \n \n33. \nConsulting  Services. Construction supervision activities, involving 5,520 person-months \nof  consulting  services,  will  be  undertaken  by  domestic  consulting  teams,  headed  by  a  chief \nsupervision  engineer,  under  government  financing  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \ngovernment  procedures.  Besides  construction  supervision,  domestic  consultants  for  a  project \nperformance  management  system  (PPMS),  including  the  monitoring  of  the  social  development \naction plan, will be engaged. \n \n34. \nThe  Project  will  provide  66  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  to  (i) help \nwith  project  management  during  construction,  (ii) provide  expertise  in  tunnel  and  bridge \n\n \n\n\fconstruction, (iii) conduct a safety audit of the project design and make safety recommendations \non the completed construction works, (iv) help set up and implement quality control procedures, \n(v) monitor  the  environmental  impact  of  the  project  and  provide  guidance  on  environmental \nmitigation measures as well as help develop capacity in vehicle emissions, (vi) help formulate a \ncapacity development program, and (vii) help establish and implement a PPMS. The team leader \nwill be in the field during construction and act as assistant chief supervision engineer, (i) helping \nthe  chief  supervision  engineer  certify  variation  orders,  contractor\u2019s  monthly  payments,  and \nsubcontracting  documents;  and  (ii) helping  establish  a  contract  management  system.  All \nconsultants  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged  based  on  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n35. \nAdvance  Action.  Given  the  high  priority  accorded  to  the  Project  and  the  need  to \ncommence  works  in  April  2006,  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works. 32 \nAdvance  action  covers  the  prequalification  of  contractors,  bidding,  and  bid  evaluation,  but  not \ncontract awards. The advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project. \n \nDisbursement Arrangements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out \n36. \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Since most payments will be made for \nlarge contracts well above $100,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to \nwithdraw  the  loan  funds.  If  the  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's \nreimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  Statement  of  expenditures  will  be  applied  to  reimburse \neligible expenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000, to expedite fund flow. \n \n37. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  Project  Company  will  maintain  separate \naccounts for the Project and related financial statements and will have them audited annually in \naccordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied  by  independent  auditors, \nwhose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Project \nCompany  will  submit  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified \ncopies of audited project accounts and financial statements and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, \nall in English. A separate audit opinion on the use of the statement of expenditures, if any, will be \nincluded as part of the auditor\u2019s report. During project implementation, the Project Company will \nsubmit  quarterly  progress  reports.  To  facilitate  project  postevaluation,  the  Project  Company  will \nfurnish to ADB a completion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n38. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  To  demonstrate  the  development \neffectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its  performance  to  stakeholders,  ADB \nuses  the  PPMS. 33 For  this  purpose,  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project  performance  in \nrelation  to  the  project  impact,  outcomes,  and  outputs  has  been  agreed  on  with  SPCD.  These \nindicators  will  be  refined  at  the  start  of  project  implementation  and  may  include  (i) economic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  indicators  for  the  project  area,  (ii) industrial  and  agricultural  outputs, \nrates, \n(iii) transport  costs  and \n\n(iv) transport  services  and  charges, \n\n(v) accident \n\ntime, \n\n                                                           \n32 Advance action was reported in the March 2005 internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities. \n33 The PPMS comprises five components: design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), project performance report, \ngovernment monitoring and evaluation, project completion report, and project performance audit report. Through TA, \nADB seeks to develop a county poverty monitoring system that provides timely, relevant, and high-quality information \nuseful for poverty-related analysis of ADB-financed transport projects. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\n(vi) accessibility by roads and buses in the project area, and (vii) and jobs created in construction \nand maintenance. Employment impact indicators will include information about unskilled laborers, \npoor  laborers,  and  women  laborers,  and  will  be  monitored  through  an  annual  report.  At  the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation,  the  Project  Company  will  establish  a  baseline  and  target \nvalues for the indicators. The indicators will be measured at project completion and 3 years later, \nand will be compared with the baseline. A report summarizing the key findings will be submitted to \nADB. A full-time staff member of the Project Company will be designated to undertake monitoring \nand evaluation with the consultants. \n \nProject Review. In 2008, SPCD, the Project Company, and ADB will carry out a midterm \n39. \nreview  of \nthe  Project,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the Project\u2019s performance and continuing viability. \n \n40. \nAnticorruption  Measures.  The  Government  has  made  significant  efforts  to  stop \ncorruption in the road sector. To date, 15 government officials from 10 provincial communications \ndepartments 34  have  been  found  to  be  involved  in  corruption.  Information  related  to  these \ncorruption cases is in the public domain. There is no evidence that any of the reported corruption \nwas related to ADB-financed road projects,35 according to the China National Audit Office. During \nproject  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  central  and  local  government \nofficials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for \nbidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the \nprocurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption \nare discovered. \n \n41. \nBased  on  the  Project  Company\u2019s  experience  in  fighting  corruption,  the  following  actions \nwill  be  taken  to  prevent  corruption  in  the  Project:  (i) officials  from  the  Discipline  and  Inspection \nBureau will be resident in project offices for bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) an internal \naudit unit will be established in the Project Company; (iii) a two-contract system will be adopted, \nwhere  the  winner  of  a  civil  works  contract  must  also  sign  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the \nemployer;  (iv) liaison  meetings  between  SPCD  and  the  Prosecutor's  Office  will  be  initiated  to \ndiscuss warnings about or information on corrupt practices; and (v) contractors will be periodically \nreviewed to ensure that fund withdrawal and settlement procedures are being followed. \n \n42. \nCapacity  Building. Based on the TA findings, SPCD and the Project Company need to \ndevelop their capacity to manage sector development and expressway operations effectively and \nefficiently  to  cope  with  increased  road  construction  and  management  activities.  A  human \nresource  development  plan  will  be  drawn  up  with  the  help  of  the  international  consultants.  The \nplan  will  consider  the  staff  needs  determined  based  on  a  survey  on  the  skill level in  key  areas, \nand  the  recruitment  and  training  requirements  identified.  It  will  include  53  person-months  of \ntraining,  covering  expressway  commercialization,  highway  operations  and \ninternational \nmanagement, \nfinancial \nmanagement, highway maintenance and asset management, tunnel construction and technology, \ntraffic engineering and road safety, and construction risk management. Findings from the training \nwill be disseminated in Sichuan through an institute. The Project Company will, with the help of \n\ntunnel  operation  and  management, \n\ntransport  system, \n\nintelligent \n\n                                                           \n34 Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan. \n35 Road  projects  in  Hebei  Province  and  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region  were  investigated  by  ADB  to  detect  and \nprevent  corruption.  The  investigation  found  no  conclusive  evidence  that  these  projects  had  involved  any  fraud  or \ncorruption. \n\n \n\n\fthe  international  consultants,  develop  a  50  person-month  training  program  through  the  Sichuan \nCommunications  and  Technology  Management  College  to  enhance  the  local  communications \nbureau staff\u2019s capacity and skills in road maintenance and traffic management and thus ensure \nsustainable operation of the local road component. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n43. \nThe traffic volume on the existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about \n10% per annum in the last 5 years. The roads are already at capacity in certain sections. If the \nnew road is not constructed, traffic growth will be suppressed and transport costs will increase. \nCongested  traffic  will  slow  the  project  area\u2019s  economic  growth.  Based  on  the  TA  findings \n(footnote  3),  traffic  volume  on  the  expressway  is  forecast  to  grow  from  10,615  pcu  per  day  in \n2011 to 20,495 pcu per day in 2021, a 6.8% average annual growth rate. It will then grow more \nslowly at 5.8% per annum to reach 34,043 pcu in 2030 (Appendix 11). \n \nB. \n \n44. \nTo  meet  growing  transport  demand  in  the  project  area,  an  alternative  analysis  reviewed \nvarious  options  for  transport  modes,  alignments,  technical  designs,  timing  of  investments,  and \nfinancing modalities as part of the national and provincial transport network plan. The conclusion \nwas to improve road transport by constructing an expressway supported by complementary local \nroad  improvement.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  by  comparing \nsituations with and without the Project. Without the Project, the traffic volume would exceed the \noptimum capacity of the existing National Highway 108, which would become congested, thereby \nincreasing  travel  time,  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  and  the  number  of  accidents.  With  the \nProject,  travel  time  would  be  reduced  by  higher  speeds  and  shorter  distance;  VOCs  would  be \nreduced  by  faster  and  smoother  travel  on  the  expressway;  and  the  accident  rate  would  be \nreduced  by  elimination  of  congestion,  provision  of  safety  features,  and  separation  of  fast-  and \nslow-moving traffic. If local roads are not upgraded, people in the remote parts of the project area \nwill  have  less  mobility,  and  the  mainly  poor  inhabitants  will  not  be  able  to  participate  in  the \nmainstream  of  economic  activities.  The  economic  costs  of  the  expressway  reflect  the  resource \ncosts for construction, O&M, and the value of agricultural production from land lost permanently. \nThe  economic  benefits  generated  by  the  expressway  include  (i) savings  in  VOCs  as  a  result  of \nreduced road length and improved traffic conditions, (ii) time savings for road users, (iii) savings \nfrom avoided accidents, (iv) benefits from generated traffic, and (v) traffic diversion from rail. The \nbenefits from the local roads were estimated from reduced VOCs and producer surplus (the value \nof additional production minus production costs). \n \nThe project EIRR is estimated at 15.2%, indicating that the Project is economically viable \n45. \n(Appendix 12).  Results  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project's  economic \nviability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 10% reduction in benefits, do not significantly \nimpact on economic viability. The capital cost would have to increase by 61% from the estimate \nfor the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by 38% \nto  achieve  the  same  effect.  In  light  of  experience  in  the  PRC  road  sector,  variations  of  such \nmagnitude are unlikely. The EIRR was calculated separately for the expressway (15.2%) and for \nlocal roads (15.9%). The economic analysis was extended to cover the distribution of project net \nbenefits  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various  beneficiaries,  including  road  users \n(passengers and freight), labor, and the government. Road users will receive the largest share of \nnet benefits, accounting for 93% of the total net benefits (Appendix 12). \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nC. \n \nThe  proposed  toll  rates 36  for  the  expressway  are  considered  reasonable  to  attract \n46. \nsufficient  traffic  to  meet  the  criteria  for  economic  and  financial  rate  of  return.  The  Project \nCompany will undertake a toll analysis before opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years \nthereafter,  to  confirm  the  appropriate  level  of  toll,  and  it  will  submit  the  results  for  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence.  If  an  adjustment  of  the  toll  levels  is  required  based  on  this  principle,  the  Project \nCompany  will  submit  its  toll  adjustment  plans  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  before  finalizing  and \nsubmitting it to SPG for approval. \n \n47. \nFinancial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  the  Project  Company  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nFinanced by ADB to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the Project (Appendix 13). \nThe projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M \ncosts,  income  taxes,  and  debt  service.  Incremental  costs  and  revenues  were  derived  by \nevaluating the financial position of the Project Company. A financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nfor  the  expressway,  computed  after  taxes,  is  5.4%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  3.9%.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under \nadverse conditions. Based on the financial projections and financial evaluation of the expressway \ncomponent, the Project is considered financially viable and sustainable (Appendix 13). \n \nD. \n \n48. \nThe population in the project area is 938,930 (814,310 rural and 124,620 urban). Of the \ntotal  rural  population,  252,200  people  (31%)  are  poor  (annual  per  capita  income  of  less  than \nCNY900).  Of  the  total  urban  population,  20,800  people  (17%)  are  urban  poor  (less  than  the \nminimum  standard  of  living),  resulting  in  a  29%  overall  poverty  incidence.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14, and a full poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n49.  Most  of  the  project  area  is  mountainous.  The  productive  environment  in  these  areas  is \npoor  due  to  difficult  topography,  low  soil  fertility,  and  difficult  climate,  leading  to  low  agricultural \nproductivity.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  remoteness  and  poor  road  access,  which,  in  turn, \nhave led to weak social infrastructure, including agricultural extension, health, and education. As \na  consequence,  off-farm  incomes  are  essential  to  reduce  poverty.  The  Project  will  improve \naccess  to  such  opportunities  within  the  project  area  and  beyond  while  stimulating  agricultural \nproduction.  Road  development  is,  however,  necessary  but  not  sufficient  to  facilitate  growth  and \nreduce  poverty.  Therefore,  a  set  of  complementary  activities  to  enhance  the  Project\u2019s  positive \nimpacts  and  to  minimize  its  possible  negative  impacts  has  been  agreed  on  with  SPCD  and \nincluded in a social development action plan (SDAP) (Supplementary Appendix I). The activities, \nwhich  target  poor  villages  and  households,  include  (i)  public  consultation,  (ii)  resettlement  and \nincome  recovery  of  the  population  affected  by  the  expressway,  (iii)  prevention  of  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS,37 (iv) enhancement of poverty reduction impacts, and (v) tourism promotion. \n \n\n                                                           \n36 The proposed toll rates are CNY0.35\u2013CNY1.40 per vehicle-km. To reduce the burden of the toll charges on the low-\nincome local residents, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls. The poor \nlocal residents, who may not directly use the project expressway,  will indirectly benefit from the reduction in freight \nrates and passenger fares by 10% by 2015. \n\n37 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\fThe project area has 157,000 members of ethnic minorities (17% of the total population). \n50. \nOver  85%  are  in  Shimian  and  Mianning  counties;  86%  are  Yi.  Their  social  and  economic \nconditions have improved significantly in recent years primarily because of (i) better agricultural \nproductivity,  (ii)  increased  demand  for  labor  from  urban  areas  and  local  enterprises,  and  (iii) \nenhanced  physical  and  social  infrastructure  resulting  from  concerted  poverty  reduction  and \nminority  development  programs.  Most  of  the  minority  population  will  directly  benefit  from  the \nProject,  either  as  residents  of  villages  targeted  by  the  local  road  component  or  of  townships \ncrossed by the expressway. The Project is therefore seen as having a significant impact on the \ndevelopment  of  the  minority  population,  and  hence  is  an  indigenous  people  category-A  project. \nAn  ethnic  minorities  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nindigenous peoples, including, for example, protection of minority communities from construction \ndisturbances, control of HIV/AIDS, provision of microcredit to rural women, and afforestation (see \nAppendix  15  for  a  summary  EMDP  and  Supplementary  Appendix  J  for  a  full  one).  The \nresettlement impact of ethnic minorities is addressed in the resettlement plan. \n \n51. \nIn  Sichuan,  3,258  people  were  infected  with  HIV  as  of  June  2004,  and  in  Liangshan \nPrefecture,  1,441.  The  Sichuan  Provincial  Health  Department,  especially  through  its  centers  for \ndisease control (CDCs), has been regularly conducting various activities to prevent HIV/AIDS as \nwell  as  to  promote  overall  health  and  hygienic  standards  and  prevent  other  diseases.  Specific \nproject-based activities receive international assistance, such as PRC\u2013United Kingdom HIV/AIDS \nPrevention  and  Care  Project  funded  by  the  United  Kingdom.  The  CDCs  regularly  inspect \nconstruction  sites  to  control  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  diseases,  and  to  keep  hygienic \nstandards,  including  for  food.  To  prevent  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  associated  with  the  Project,  the \nCDCs  agreed  to  extend  their  preventive  measures  to  the  communities  along  the  Project, \nparticularly  construction  sites,  including  provision  of  HIV  test  kits,  contraceptives,  education, \nposters,  leaflets,  and  regular  services  such  as  monitoring  and  surveillance,  focusing  on \nconstruction  workers.  In  carrying  out  the  civil  works  contracts,  the  Implementation  Methods  of \nEpidemic Prevention Law will be followed. \n \nE. \n \n52. \nThis is an environmental category-A project. An EIA for the expressway was prepared by \nSPCD, and an environmental assessment of the local roads was prepared by the TA consultants. \nA  summary  EIA  for  the  Project  was  prepared  and  circulated  to  the  Board  and  made  public \nthrough ADB's website on 24 February 2005. To ensure that all potential adverse environmental \nimpacts  of  project  design,  construction,  and  operation  are  mitigated,  SPCD  will  implement  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  including  a  monitoring  program,  mitigation  measures, \ninstitutional  arrangements,  and  budgeting  as  specified  in  the  EIA.  The  project  expressway  will \npass  through  the  experimental  zone  of  Liziping  Nature  Reserve,  based  on  the  feasibility  study, \nwhere multiple land uses are allowed. Potential environmental impacts on the reserve area will be \nminimized by implementing the EMP, which will be incorporated into the bidding documents and \ncontracts of civil works. \n \nF. \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  affect  five  counties:  Yucheng,  Yingjing,  Hanyuan,  and  Shimian  in  Ya\u2019an \nmunicipality;  and  Mianning  in  Liangshan  Prefecture.  Based  on  the  feasibility  study,  1,466 \nhectares (ha) will be acquired, 56% of which is farmland, comprising paddy (21%) and dry land \n(35%). The remaining 44% is forestland, fruit trees, housing plots, and wasteland. Approximately \n348 ha will be occupied temporarily during construction. The farmland acquisition is equivalent to \nthe complete loss of farmland for 20,237 people. Along with land acquisition, about 94,800 square \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nis  responsible \n\nlocal  government \n\nmeters of houses will be demolished, requiring the relocation of 790 households or 2,634 people, \nmost to a site close to their village, and allowing housing improvement. \n \n54. \nThis  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category-A  project.  SPCD  has  conducted  a  social \nimpact  assessment  and  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  (see  Appendix  16  for  a  summary \nresettlement plan, and Supplementary Appendix K for a full one). Consultations have been held \nwith local officials, village leaders, and project-affected households to minimize impacts on towns, \nvillages, and high-yield paddy and fruit gardens. To mitigate impacts on incomes and livelihoods \nof  project-affected  people,  higher-than-average  compensation  has  been  proposed,  and  various \nrehabilitation  strategies  have  been  prepared.  The \nfor \nimplementing  the  resettlement  plan,  but  the  village  and  group  leaders  will  take  the  key \nimplementation  decisions  and  actions  concerning  livelihood  and  income  rehabilitation.  The \nresettlement plan was distributed to local officials, and the resettlement information booklet was \ndisseminated to project-affected people in February 2005. A revised resettlement plan based on \npreliminary design will be required before 31 October 2005, which provides updated impacts by \nvillage, rehabilitation plans for villages seriously affected by the Project, and special measures to \nsupport  households  that  face  hardship.  In  addition,  before  civil  works  start,  a  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  based  on  detailed  design  will  be  completed,  providing  an  inventory  list  of \nproject-affected assets. Upon completion of the survey for the project expressway and local road \ncomponents,  SPCD  will  submit  the  updated  resettlement  plan  with  any  modifications  to  ADB \nbefore civil works start. \n \nG. \n \nThe Project was formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and social \n55. \nrisks. The main technical risks are associated with the tunnel (34.5 km in total) and bridges (64.0 \nkm  in  total).  To  mitigate  the  risks,  international  consultants  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and \nconstruction  methods.  Prequalification  of  contractors  focuses  on  their  financial  and  technical \ncapability  to  handle  complex  works.  During  construction,  monitoring  and  contract  management \ninformation  systems  will  be  set  up  and  implemented,  with  the  assistance  of  the  international \nconsultants,  for  timely  identification  of  technical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective \nmeasures.  SPCD  has  experience,  and  has  shown  satisfactory  performance,  in  implementing \ninternationally  financed  projects.  Economic  performance  in  the  project-influenced  area  would \nhave to deteriorate substantially for the Project to lose its economic viability. The financial risks \nassociated  with  construction  and  operation  of  the  expressway  will  depend  on  the  level  and \ncomposition of traffic, construction costs, ability of the commercial management, and appropriate \ntolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  the  Project  Company  will  build  up  a  commercial  business \nenvironment  for  expressway  operations,  the  project  expressway  will  receive  substantial  equity \nfrom  the  government,  and  an  appropriate  toll  structure  will  be  adopted.  For  a  project  that \ngenerates revenue in domestic currency, a risk is related to exchange rate changes and is partly \naccounted  for  in  the  base  case  calculations.  An  adverse  exchange  rate  change  of  30%  would \nhave only a small effect on the financial return. The social risks include resettlement, HIV/AIDS \ninfection,  and  ethnic  minority  communities  associated  with  the  Project.  Appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures are in place in the resettlement plan, EMDP, and social action development plan. \n \n\nRisks \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n56. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, SPG, and SPCD have given the \n\n \n\n\f \n57. \nConstruction  Quality.  The  Project  Company  will  ensure  that  the  Project  expressway  is \nconstructed in accordance with 2004 technical standards of MOC for highway engineering. The \ninternational  consultant designated as  the  team  leader  and  assistant chief  supervision  engineer \nwill  review  and  help  the  chief  supervision  engineer  certify  variation  orders  and  contractors\u2019 \nmonthly payments before submission to the chief supervision engineer. \n \n58. \nRoad  Safety. Before project construction and operations, the Project Company will carry \nout  road  safety  audits,  the  recommendations  of  which  will  be  implemented  before  project \nconstruction  and  operations.  For  the  project  expressway,  SPCD  and  the  Project  Company  will \nimplement  the  road  safety  signage,  communications,  hazard  barriers,  traffic  monitoring,  and \nvehicle weighing in accordance with MOC regulations and other regulations and standards. The \nProject  Company  will  cooperate  closely  with  the  Sichuan  Public  Security  Bureau  to  implement \nroad  safety  measures.  Before  the  project  expressway  opens,  SPCD  will  submit  a  report  on  the \nemergency response plan to ADB for review. \n \nRoadside  Stations.  Before  completion  of  the  local  roads  under  the  Project,  SPCD  will \n59. \nestablish  roadside  stations  to  facilitate  community  development  by  linking  such  roads  with \ncommunity activities. Facilities to be provided at the roadside stations may include parking areas; \nbus  terminals;  gasoline  stations;  information  centers  about  roads,  road  safety,  tourism,  and \nHIV/AIDS; local specialty markets; restaurants; and agroprocessing facilities. \n \n60. \nCorporate  Governance.  SPCD  and  the  Project  Company  will  enter  into  a  concession \nframework  agreement  by  31  December  2007  to  ensure  autonomy  of  operations,  encourage  the \nestablishment of road performance indicators, and facilitate refinancing of road sector assets. The \nProject  Company  will  prepare  a  corporate  development  plan  by  31  December  2007  to  assure \nhigh standards of corporate governance, management practices, and financial reporting. \n \nPrivate Sector Development. Six months before the project facilities open, SPG through \n61. \nthe  Project Company  will  analyze  the  feasibility  of  attracting  private  sector  investment  funds  for \nfuture  road  sector  investment,  including  private  sector  participation  in  O&M  of  the  project \nexpressway, and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n62. \nTolls. The tolls for the Project expressway will be set will be set by SPG. In determining \nthe toll level, SPG will take into consideration the levels sufficient to satisfy the Project Company\u2019s \nminimum  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  1.2.  Six  months  before  the  expressway  opens,  SPCD \nthrough  the  Project  Company  will  seek  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  on  the  proposed  toll  structure  and \nlevels before seeking SPG approval. For the first 5 years of operation, SPCD through the Project \nCompany  will  annually  review  the  toll  structure  and  levels,  and  submit  a  report  to  ADB.  SPCD \nthrough the Project Company will seek ADB\u2019s concurrence on toll level adjustment before seeking \nSPG approval. \n \n63. \nFinancial  Ratios.  To  ensure  financial  sustainability,  the  Project  Company  will  maintain \n(i) a  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  not  more  than  55:45  from  the  third  year  of  full  operation;  (ii) a  working \nratio  (annual  O&M  cost,  but  excluding  periodic maintenance  cost,  to  revenue)  of  not  more  than \n15%;  and  (iii) a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  not  less  than  1.2  from  the  third  year  of  full \noperation. \n \nCapacity  Building.  The  Project  Company  in  consultation  with  SPCD  will  prepare  a \n64. \nhuman  resource  development  plan.  Before  undertaking  international  training,  the  Project \nCompany  will  prepare  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  a  training  plan,  a  program  of  workshops  to  be \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\ndelivered  at  the  Project  Company  by  people  trained  internationally,  and  a  list  of  training \nequipment and aids to strengthen the Project Company\u2019s domestic training programs. \n \n65. \nEnvironment.  SPCD  and  the  Project  Company  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  designed, \nconstructed, and operated in accordance with government rules and regulations and ADB\u2019s policy \non  environment  (2002).  SPCD  and  the  Project  Company  will  implement  the  EMP  set  out  in  the \nEIA,  which  will  be  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  prior  to \ncompletion  of  the  preliminary  design,  and  the  summary  EIA  to  mitigate  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project,  and  submit  a  semiannual  report  to  ADB; \nmitigation measures will be incorporated into the bidding documents and civil works contracts. \n \n66. \nVehicle Emissions. SPG will (i) provide to ADB the national emission standards and the \npenalties  for  infringement  of  such  standards,  and  (ii) ensure  that  Sichuan  Environmental \nProtection  Bureau,  Sichuan  Public  Security  Bureau,  and  other  agencies  enforce  the  national \nvehicle  emission  standards,  and  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  government  strategies,  at  least 6 \nmonths before the opening of the expressway. \n \n67. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  SPG  and  SPCD  will  ensure  through  the  Project \nCompany that land acquisition and resettlement are carried out promptly and efficiently following \nthe  resettlement  plan  agreed  on  with  ADB,  in  line  with  the  Land  Administration  Law  and  ADB's \npolicies on involuntary resettlement (1995) and indigenous peoples (1998). SPG and SPCD will \nensure  through  the  Project  Company  that  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  monitored \nand evaluated and reported to ADB as required in the plan. \n \nEthnic Minorities. SPCD and local governments will implement the EMDP to ensure that \n68. \nethnic minorities benefit from the Project at least equitably and in accordance with ADB's policy \non indigenous peoples (1998), and that implementation of the EMDP be monitored and evaluated \nby an independent agency. \n \n69. \nPoverty Reduction. The Government will cause SPG to implement the SDAP in a timely \nmanner.  The  Project  Company  will  cause  the  contractors  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local \npoor people who meet the job and efficiency requirements for construction of the project roads. \nSuch workers will be trained on the job. The Government will cause SPG to extend the coverage \nand quality of public utilities, basic health, and basic education in the project area to enhance the \nProject\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  in  consultation  with  the \nProject  Company,  will  monitor  the  impacts  on  poverty  with  the  assistance  of  a  designated  local \ninstitute based on a set of indicators as outlined in the SDAP, and will submit annual monitoring \nreports to ADB. \n \n70. \nLabor  Standards.  SPCD  through  the  Project  Company  will  ensure  that  civil  works \ncontractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  legislation.  Bidding  documents  and  civil  works \ncontracts will include clauses, prohibiting child labor for construction and maintenance activities, \nensuring equal pay for men and women for work of equal value, and requiring a timely payment \nfor workers on a monthly basis. The compliance will be monitored by the Project Company. \n \n71. \nGender  and  Development. SPCD and the Project Company will ensure implementation \nof the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development (1998). SPCD shall \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  measures  aimed  at  increasing  project  benefits  and \nimpacts on women in the project areas, which are included in the EMDP and SDAP. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fHealth  Risks.  The  Department  of  Health  and  the  Project  Company,  together  with  the \n72. \nappropriate  authorities,  will  ensure  that  contractors  disseminate  information  on  the  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  to  those  employed  during  project  implementation. \nThe Department of Health and SPCD will also ensure that similar information is disseminated to \ntransport operators and local communities such as ethnic minorities, women, and other high-risk \ngroups living in the project area during project operation, at roadside stations, and other suitable \nfacilities.  SPCD  will  cause  contractors  to  monitor  health  risk  control  according  to  the \nImplementation Methods of Epidemic Prevention Law of the PRC (1991). \n \n73. \nAxle  Loads.  SPCD  through  the  Project  Company  will  install  vehicle  axle-weighing \nequipment at selected entry points. Before opening the project expressway, the Project Company \nwill submit to ADB the  plan for operation of the vehicle weigh stations, including the prescribed \naxle-load limits and penalties for infringement. \n \n74. \nChange  in  Ownership.  If  any  change  in  ownership  of  the  project  facilities,  or  any  sale, \ntransfer,  or  assignment  of  SPCD\u2019s  interest  in  the  project  expressway  is  anticipated,  the \nGovernment,  SPG,  and  the  Project  Company  will  consult  ADB  at  least  6  months  before  the \nchange. \n \n75. \nAnticorruption  Measures.  SPCD  through  the  Project  Company  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s \nand  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  will  be  followed.  SPCD  through  the  Project  Company \nwill also ensure, in accordance with the Government\u2019s regulations and requirements, during project \nimplementation that (i) officials from the Discipline and Inspection Bureau will be resident in project \noffices for bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) an internal audit unit will be established in the \nProject  Company;  (iii) a  two-contract  system  will  be  adopted  where  the  winner  of  a  civil  works \ncontract must also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iv)  periodic inspection of \ncontractors  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  fund  withdrawal  and  settlement  procedures  are \nfollowed.

Of  this,  1.44 million km  were  classified. \nRoads of class II and above accounted for 287,000 km, 15.3% of the total length. Road density \nhas increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to 19.4 km per 100 km2 in 2004. \nIn  2004,  Sichuan\u2019s  road  network  accounted  for  6.1%  of  the  country\u2019s  total,  with  a  length  of \n113,043 km. Of this, 76,401 km (67.6 %) was classified: 1,758 km, expressways (1.6%); 1,496 \nkm,  class  I  (1.3%);  9,633  km,  class  II  (8.5%);  and  63,514  km,  of  classes  III  and  IV  (56.2%). \nUnclassified roads amounted to 36,642 km (32.4%). Road density in Sichuan was 23.3 km per \n100 km2, slightly higher than the national average, but the proportion of roads under class II and \nabove is significantly lower. \n \n2. \nThe  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n(UNESCAP)  is  promoting  a  transregional  Asian  highway  network,  extending  140,000 km,  of \nwhich 26,000 km are in the PRC. Road projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nare helping develop this network through a total of 13 completed or planned projects comprising \n2,100 km, with a total loan amount of about $2.4 billion. \n  \nB. \n \n3. \nIn 2003, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled 24 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 72 million \nother  motorized  vehicles  (motorcycles  and  agricultural  vehicles).  The  privately  owned  fleet  of \nmotor  vehicles  increased  more  than  20  times  during  1985\u20132003,  from  0.3 million  vehicles  to \n12.0 million.  Despite  the  rapid  increase  in  total vehicles,  there  are  only  about  1.3  vehicles  per \n100  people,  which  is  lower  than  in  other  Asian  countries.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World \nTrade Organization has increased investment in the automobile industry, reduced the tariffs on \nimported vehicles, and contributed to easing motor vehicle financing. These factors, plus rapidly \ngrowing  urban  incomes,  underpin  the  growth  in  road  traffic.  The  modernization  of  the  vehicle \nfleet  will  improve  vehicle  safety  and  reduce  individual  vehicles\u2019  fuel  consumption  and  their \nemissions.  In  2003,  the  number  of  vehicles  registered  in  Sichuan  was  734,200  passenger \nvehicles and 392,600 freight vehicles. Vehicle ownership in Sichuan is lower than the national \naverage.  Privately  owned  vehicles  totaled  670,200.  Road  passenger  traffic  in  Sichuan \nmeasured in terms of passenger-km of travel grew by more than 33% in 2000\u20132003, reaching \n47.7 billion passenger-km. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew by 35% during the same period. \n \nC. \n\nVehicle Fleet and Traffic \n\nRoad Administration \n\n \n\nThe  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  is  responsible  for \n4. \nregulating  the  road  transport  industry  by  licensing  intercity  bus  services.  Freight  transport  is \nessentially deregulated; however, interprovincial bus routes require Ministry of Communications \n(MOC)  approval.  Because  of  trucking  reforms,  private  operations  have  increased,  improving \ntransport  efficiency  and  quality  of  services  and  increasing  competition.  ADB  is  supporting  this \nprocess  through  a  technical  assistance  (TA),1 which  aims  to  help  improve  the  performance  of \nthe road transport industry by formulating policy reforms in road freight and passenger services. \nRoad administration is decentralized. Road transport tariffs are allowed within a range of plus or \nminus 20% of advisory tariffs set by the local government. This flexibility, coupled with ease of \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Two \ndedicated  user  charges,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle  purchase  fee,  have  provided \nmuch  of  the  financing  for  the  road  sector.  During  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  of  1996\u20132000,  the \nroad  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle  purchase  fee  provided  53%  and  13%,  respectively,  of  the \ntotal  road  investments.  Government  grants  provided  2%,  mainly  to  construct  or  improve  rural \nroads  in  poor  areas.  The  rest  was  financed  from  domestic  loans  and  bonds  (9%);  other \ndomestic investments, including financing from local governments and state-owned enterprises \n(12%); foreign loans (8%); and foreign direct investment (3%). \n \n6. \nAs  part  of  a  tax  reform  to  bring  off-budget  revenue  and  expenditures  within  the \nframework of the national budget, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Highway Law \non 31 October 1999, laying the foundation for legislation providing for national taxes to replace \nprovincial  and  local  fees.  The  vehicle  purchase  fee  was  replaced  by  the  vehicle  purchase  tax \neffective January 2001, and a fuel tax is being considered to replace the road maintenance fee. \nBased on findings of an ADB-financed TA,2 the fuel tax is likely to improve financing of the road \nsector.  \n \n7. \nSPCD  invested  about  CNY16.2  billion  in  the  road  sector  in  2004:  CNY12.9  billion  for \nconstruction and CNY1.4 billion for maintenance. During the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), \ntotal investment is expected to be about CNY71 billion, with an annual average growth rate of \n5.0%  during  this  period.  SPCD  plans  to  increase  road  investment  to  CNY78  billion  during  the \n11th Five-Year Plan. \n \nE. \n \n8. \nRoad  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of expressways, high-standard roads, \nand  associated  structures.  Design  institutes  are  staffed  with  experienced,  well-qualified \npersonnel. The city and county highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out \nminor  projects  within  their  administrative  districts.  Drawing  on  the  experience  gained  under \nADB-  and  World  Bank-financed  projects,  competitive  bidding  practices  were  mandated  by  the \n1999 Tendering and Bidding Law.3 Many of the largest provincial and urban construction units \nare being reorganized into financially independent companies and have been awarded contracts \nindividually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World Bank-financed in-country \nor overseas projects. \n \n9. \nRoad  maintenance  is  well  organized  by  the  expressway  companies  and  the  highway \nadministration  bureaus  and  is  carried  out  mainly  through  labor-intensive  operations  but  with \nincreasing  amounts  of  mechanized  works.  Although  maintenance  expenditures  increased \nsignificantly  in  absolute  terms  in  the  past  decade  and  maintenance  is  generally  adequate, \nmaintenance  expenditures  has  not  increased  as  a  percentage  of  total  road  expenditures.  In \n\nRoad Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1998.

Thus,  maintenance  standards  in  rural  areas  are  responsive  to  public  pressure \nwhere  there  is  a  strong  tradition  of  public  accountability.  This  is  less  effective  in  towns  where \nsuch issues tend to be media-led and do not normally result in sustained pressure.4 \n \nF. \n \n10.  MOC has prepared the National Rural Road Development Plan, under which rural roads \nwill be developed in three stages. By 2005, rural roads will make up 1.55 million km; by 2010, \n1.85 million km,  connecting  all \ntownships  and  administrative  villages;  and  by  2020, \n2.5 million km, and transport services will be provided to administrative village level. MOC plans \nto invest CNY100 billion in rural roads from 2006 to 2010. By 2010, all villages in the eastern \nregion will be linked with asphalt or cement roads, and the same targets will be applied to 80% \nvillages in the central region and to 90% towns in the western region. \n \nG. \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\n11. \nA relaxation of trucking regulations in the 1980s allowed privately owned trucks to haul \ncargo for state-owned factories and cooperatives. Privately owned trucks expanded their market \nshare during the 1990s at the expense of state-owned transport companies, many of which are \nnow  being  privatized.  The  competition  improves  road  transport  efficiency  and  service  quality. \nMOC  is  encouraging  the  private  sector  to  augment  the  overall  capacity  of  the  road  transport \nindustry. More small freight operators will merge and more large state-owned companies will be \nprivatized. \n \nH. \n \n12. \nADB  has  been  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road  sector  since  1991.  The \nprincipal  issues  include  the  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  highway  design  standards, \nconstruction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization, and nongovernment financial resources.

the basic element of the national road network and provides basic \naccess  to  rural  populations.  The  Government  invests  about  CNY20  billion  in  rural  road \ndevelopment  annually,  compared  with  only  CNY1  billion\u20132  billion  annually  before  2003.  Total \nmileage  of  newly  built  rural  road  every  year  is  about  50,000  kilometers  (km)  and  that  of \nreconstruction is about 150,000 km. In 2004, total mileage of rural road reached 1.42 million km. \nThe  Government  built  102,000  km  of  rural  roads  in  2003,  and  250,000  km  in  2004,  building \nabout  192,000  km  of  paved  rural  roads.  In  2004,  along  with  building  roads  connecting  to  123 \ntownships  and  11,200  villages,  the  Government  built  paved  roads  connecting  to  1,690 \ntownships and 57,500 villages. \n \n2. \nThe  State  Council  approved  the  Rural  Road  Development  Plan  in  February  2005. The \noverall objective of the plan aimed at 2020 is that the townships and villages will be accessible \nto paved roads, forming a rural road network with high service level, making travel more rapid, \nsafe,  and  comfortable  for  farmers. The  development  goal  is  that  by  2010,  all  townships  in  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  will  be  connected  to  paved  roads  and  all  villages  in  eastern  and \ncentral regions will be connected to paved roads by 2010. In 2010, total mileage of rural roads \nwill be 3.1 million km. This is expected to increase to 3.7 million km by 2020, improving density \nand service level of rural roads. \n \n3. \nThe  project  expressway  is  supported  by  the  local  road  component,  thereby  improving \naccess  to  townships  and  villages  in  the  project  area.  By  lowering  transport  costs  and  travel \ntimes, the Project will foster trade, economic development, growth, and incomes in the region. In \ndoing so, it will help reduce the prices of daily necessities in local markets and villages served \nby its interchanges and improve access to external markets, information, services, and income-\nearning  opportunities.  These  benefits  will  be  increased  and  more  widely  distributed  by \nintegrating the 678 km of local road upgrading to the project design (Tables A5.1 and A5.2). The \nimportance of improving local roads is in line with the Government\u2019s policies. According to the \nRural  Poverty  Reduction  Development  Outline,  road  construction  projects  will  be  extended  to \npoor areas to link their townships to national and provincial trunk roads. \n \nUnder the technical assistance,1 the local road component was formulated based on the \n4. \nfollowing principles: (i) it will explicitly target the improvement of access to poor townships and \nvillages and connecting them to the national and provincial road network in the project area, (ii) \nthe  prime  emphasis  will  be  on  providing  all-weather  access  to  the  remaining  centers  and \nimproving  all-weather  roads  to  poor  villages,  and  (iii)  the  program  should  recognize  the  local \npriorities  for  road  improvement.  The  component  was  prioritized  by  the  number  of  the  poor \nserved by the road. Township and village roads were ranked separately because a township\u2019s \npopulation includes the populations of villages in its administrative area. Once ranked, the top \ntwo thirds in each category were selected. A road survey followed the initial screening process \nto confirm the selections. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2003.

administration bureaus (TABs) at \n1. \nthe provincial, prefecture, and county levels. All bus operators need an operating license and all \nbuses have to be licensed for a specific route. The TAB may, in principle, grant licenses to more \nthan  one  operator  on  the  same  route,  Yingjing  county,  however,  has  only  one  licensed  bus \noperator.  Fares  for  journeys  terminating  at  townships  or  larger  towns  are  regulated  by  the \nprovincial price bureau. Fares for township to village journeys are not regulated.  \n \n2. \nA  relatively  dense  network  of  bus  routes  connects  almost  all  the  townships  in  the \nprovince, serving all the villages on the routes. Nevertheless, many villages with poor or no road \naccess  still  have  no  direct  bus  service.  There  are  no  cross-county  routes  that  provide  direct \nconnections across township boundaries without going through township centers.  \n \nThe  government  is  encouraging  private  involvement  in  the  transport  sector.  State \n3. \ncompanies are now being sold off. Regulated fares are only a little higher than financial vehicle \noperating costs per passenger for mini-buses operating on township and village roads, but that \nnet  margins  for  medium  buses  on  good  roads  are  attractive.  Bus  operators  report  that  their \nbusinesses are profitable, especially the longer-distance services.   \n \n4. \nThe  TABs  control  the  number  of  operators  on  each  route  in  order  to  prevent  \u201cover-\nsupply,\u201d  while  the  number  of  trips  per  day  carried  out  by  each  operator  is  controlled,  either \nthrough operator associations or directly by state-owned bus terminal companies, which control \nthe bus schedule and allocate slots to operators. It would appear that these restrictive operating \npractices  result  in  low  vehicle  utilization  and,  as  a  consequence,  unnecessarily  high  operating \ncosts.  \n \n5. \nIn  the  project  area,  although  the  number  of  buses  in  operation  has  substantially \nincreased,  this  is  mainly  accounted  for  by  a  shift  towards  smaller  buses.    The  majority  of \nlicensees are individuals; the number of company licensees has fallen significantly since 1997 \nand  now  only  represents  12%  of  the  total.   Total  passenger  volumes  in  the  project  area  have \nincreased by 60% since 1997, although passenger-kilometers have only increased by 40%.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAny commercial trucking operation requires a license, which is issued by the prefecture \nTAB.  Own-account  trucking  (for  the  transport  of  goods  within  the  same  enterprise)  does  not \nneed  a  TAB  license.  Operators  must  meet  basic  requirements  on  financial  resources  and \nmaintenance  capacity.    The  licenses  are  of  indefinite  duration  and  a  small  fee  is  payable  on \ninitial licensing and for the annual vehicle inspections.  There is no annual license fee.  \n \n7. \nThe  Ministry  of  Communications  publishes  guidelines  on  freight  rates  but  truckers  are \nnot obliged to follow them.  In practice, rates are negotiated between the shipper and the trucker \nand are normally much lower than the guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFreight Transport \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n37\n\nThe  vast  majority  of  truck  operators  are  individuals.  There  are  some  large  companies, \n8. \nstate-owned  and  private,  but  their  number  has  fallen  substantially  since  1997.  Like  the  bus \nindustry,  state  trucking  is  being  privatized.    The  market  appears  to  be  genuinely  competitive. \nThere  appear  to  be  no  unreasonable  restrictions  on  the  granting  of  licenses,  and  there  is \nadequate trucking capacity. \n \n9. \nIn the project area, freight services are diverse and made up of short-distance transport \nof  bulk  goods  such  as  cement,  bricks,  coal,  and  agricultural  inputs,  by  medium-sized  trucks; \ntransport  of  manufactured  goods  into  the  area  and  agricultural  produce  out  of  the  area  by \nmedium-sized and small trucks, either owner-operated or owned by the trader; and transport of \nsmall quantities of produce and goods by agricultural vehicle, horse, and individuals, especially \nto and from townships. \n \n10. \nOverall  there  has  been  little  increase  in  freight  carried  since  1997,  and  haul  distances \nalso have remained static.  Ownership of all motorized vehicles, especially in the mountainous \nparts of the project area, is very low.  Fewer than 10% of households own agricultural vehicles.  \nHowever, it is expected that vehicle ownership will rise as road conditions improve in the project \narea. \n \nC. \n \n11. \ntowns and township centers.  Data from the social surveys show the following: \n \n\nExcluding travel within villages, the most trips by rural residents are made to the county \n\nTransport Demand \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe great majority of households make at least one trip per year to county towns \nand township centers. \nThe  frequency  of  trips  to  township centers  is much  greater  (47  trips per  annum \non average compared with 29 to county towns).  \nThe  great  majority  of  trips  to  county  towns  are  by  bus  whereas  to  township \ncenters  they  are  made  on  foot.    Trips  by  other  modes  are  negligible.    Overall \naround 58% of trips are motorized with around 80% of these being made by bus.  \nThe  main  trip  purposes  are  trading  and  the  sale  of  produce,  business  trips, \nshopping,  and  social.  Far  more  trips  to  townships  centers  are  for  the  trade  and \nsale  of  produce \nfor \nshopping/social trips.  \nIn most respects, the travel characteristics of the poor are similar to those of the \nnonpoor. This  holds  true  for  poor  households  and  all  residents  of  poor  villages. \nThere  is  one  major,  and  crucial,  exception:  journey  frequency\u2014the  poor  travel \nmuch less than the nonpoor.   \n\nthe  situation \n\nis  reversed \n\nto  county \n\ntowns; \n\nthan \n\nConclusions  \n\n \nThe  major  problem  perceived  by  local  residents  was  the  poor  quality  of  the  access \n12. \nroads, which limit the availability of bus services and make travel time-consuming and difficult, \nparticularly in times of heavy rains or winter snows. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  bus  system  is  closely  regulated  down  to  township  level  but  flexible  on  route \nplanning. The rate of growth of routes is increasing as National Road 108 and township roads \nare improved. This can be taken as a strong indication that, where road access is possible and \nwhere demand is sufficient to ensure profitability, services will be provided. \n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n14.  Where bus services are not available or are inappropriate, transport is generally by foot \nor horse in the mountainous areas, and by foot, bicycle, or motorcycle in valley areas. Trishaws \noperate  in  urban  areas  and  adjacent  villages. The  majority  of  households  in  rural  areas  make \ntrips, although they make substantially fewer trips. There is, however, no evidence that they do \nnot avail themselves of public transport services when they need them.  \n \n15. \nAlthough there is no compelling evidence that fares are excessive compared with costs, \nthe  TABs  could  do  more  to  promote  competition  between  bus  operators.  With  completion  of \nmore  expressway  links,  it  will  become  possible  to  license new  routes. This  would  help  ensure \nthat any savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) arising from road improvements are passed \non to passengers and will increase operational efficiency and promote service quality. The cost \nreductions brought about by road improvements make it more likely that new or more frequent \nservices will be introduced by a flexible bus transport sector.   \n \n16. \nAs  for  the  freight  transport,  the  characteristics  of  the  transport  services  industry  in  the \nproject area do not impede the commercialization of agriculture, as it is sufficiently flexible and \ncompetitive to provide whatever scale and kind of services that may be required. There appear \nto be no restraints on the supply of freight transport services. Vehicles are relatively cheap and \ncredit  to  purchase  them  readily  available.  Rates  are  set  competitively  and  supply  responds \neffectively to changes in demand.  Competition between the transport operators should ensure \nthat any savings in vehicle operating costs, which might arise from road improvements, would \nbe passed on to the users. \n \n17. \nFruit, the main cash crop, is mostly sold direct to traders at the farmgate. As there are \nsignificant numbers of traders, competition between them should ensure that some of the VOC \nsavings are passed on to the farmers in higher prices.

With  completion  of  this  Project,  the  Chengdu\u2013Panzhihua  Corridor  will \nbecome  a  major  artery  for  the  regional  transport  network,  connecting  with  national  and \nprovincial roads. \n \n2. \nThe project expressway will be built in parallel to an existing class-II national road (NR \n108)  that  has  a  pavement  in  poor  condition  over  many  sections,  suffers  from  winter  icing  and \nsnow  in  the  higher  elevations,  has  poor  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment  and  already  suffers \nsome congestion and interference from local and nonmotorized traffic. The expressway will link \nup  in  Lugu  with  the  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  Southern  Sichuan  Road \nDevelopment Project and provide efficient and safe road transport in central Sichuan. \n \n3. \nTraffic  surveys  were  carried  out  under  the  feasibility  study.  Sixteen-hour  origin-\ndestination (O-D) surveys and associated 24-hour classified traffic counts were done at 15 key \nlocations  along  the  existing  NR108  and  linking  roads.  The  surveys  were  carried  out  in  April \n2000. The expressway starts just south of the city of Ya\u2019an. The highest flows are just south of \nYa\u2019an  with  the  low  flows  in  the  mountainous  sparsely  populated  area  between  Yingjing  and \nHanyuan counties. The proportion of trucks is typically more than half, but ranges from 21% to \n73%. Over all traffic survey stations, the feasibility study recorded 62% trucks, mainly light and \nmedium-sized ones in about equal proportions. \n \n4. \nThe  evaluation  of  alternative  options  in  the  project  corridor\u2014i.e.,  with  and  without  the \nproposed  expressway\u2014has  been  carried  out  using  the  feasibility  traffic  demand  OD  matrices \nand  assigning  these  flows  over  the  road  networks  expected  to  in  2000  (the  base  year),  2011, \n2020, and 2030. For each link in this network, the length, pavement width, surface type, terrain, \nestimated pavement roughness, and available traffic counts were entered into the network data \nfiles to assist with validation of the matrices and traffic assignments.  \n \n5. \nVehicle speeds are affected by terrain and the degree of congestion, in turn a function of \nthe  capacity  of  the  link.  Estimates  of  road  capacity  were  based  on  the  revised  the  Ministry  of \nCommunication\u2019s Technical Standards for Highway Engineering. An initial free-flow speed was \ndefined for each road link, used in estimating initial link travel times. As link loadings increase \nand links become more congested, these times increase and link speeds reduce. The revised \nspeeds are adjusted using speed-flow relationships, also used in calculating user costs on links \nfor the economic evaluation. The relationships have been updated to take account of the hourly \ndistribution of traffic volumes and the vehicle mix in the corridor. \n \n6. \nForecast  passenger  and  freight  vehicle  OD  matrices  for  2011,  2020,  and  2030  were \ndeveloped from the 2000 base-year matrices by applying projections of regional gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  and  estimates  of  elasticities  of  transport  demand  with  respect  to  GDP  growth. \nBased  on  a  comparison  of  trends  in  GDP  and  alternative  measures  of  transport  demand\u2014\npassenger  vehicles  and  trucks  registered,  total  passengers  and  tons  moved,  and  estimated \npassenger-km  and  ton-km  in  other  developed  and  undeveloped  provinces,  the  following \ndemand elasticities were adopted: passenger trips 1.2, freight trips 0.8. \n \n7. \nThe  forecast  GDP  growth  rates  were  applied  to  the  calibrated  base-year  matrices  to \nproduce  interzonal  passenger  and  freight  vehicle  flows  for  2011,  2020,  and  2030,  which  were \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45\n\nassigned  to  the  without-project  road  network  for  the  base  year  and  each  forecast  year.  Non-\nmodeled (intrazonal) traffic was preloaded to the appropriate network links.  \n \n8. \nBy  2010,  the  traffic  on  the  existing  NR108  will  reach  capacity  at  several  points, \nparticularly near Yuchen, and by 2020 it will be well over capacity along its whole route. Rather \nthan  have  an  increasing  proportion  of  traffic  artificially  divert  to  much  longer  alternative  routes \nvia  other  corridors,  the  capacity  of  NR108  has  been  increased  to  reflect  a  more  realistic \nscenario  of  incremental  widening  at  the  most  congested  points.  This  was  done  for  certain \nsections in 2011, and again in 2020, when congestion will have worsened further. \n \n9. \nRoad vehicles moving from one zone to another choose between alternative routes on \nthe basis of their perceptions of generalized travel cost, a function of travel time, distance, and \ntoll cost. Given the significant improvements in terms of the performance and efficiency of the \nYa\u2019an\u2013Lugu corridor as a result of the Project Expressway, it will attract significant vehicle trips \n(especially through trips) from other roads, and this will reduce the number of accidents, vehicle \noperating  costs  (VOCs),  and  travel  time  on  many  roads  in  the  corridor  and  thereby  directly \nbenefit the project area. \n \n10.  When  the  expressway  is  built,  it  will  become  a  more  attractive  alternative  route  for \npeople and goods traveling along the corridor, particularly for those traveling long distances by \nrail. At present, the railway carries most of the long-distance bulk traffic in the project corridor. \nWhen  the  expressway  opens,  some  of  the  passengers  and  freight  using  rail  will  start  using  it. \nThe completed expressway from Chengdu to Panzhihua will reduce the driving distance to 610 \nkm. This compares with a rail distance of 749 km. Express passenger trains cover the journey at \nan average of 60 km/h, while the slower services travel at 50 km/h. Passengers will save about \n5 hours if they divert from rail to road.  \n \n11. \nTraffic  forecast  was  determined  based  on  socioeconomic  trends  that  took  into  account \nchanges in variables such as gross domestic product, population, and vehicle ownership. The \nforecast traffic volume on the expressway is expected to grow from 10,615 passenger car units \n(pcu) in 2011 to 20,495 pcu in 2021, a 6.8% average annual growth rate. It will then grow more \nslowly at 5.8% per annum thereafter to reach 34,043 pcu in 2030. Through traffic will be about \n40%  of  the  total.  The  traffic  on  the  local  roads  will  grow  more  slowly  because  of  slow  growth \nprospects in the project area. \n \n\nTable A11: Average Annual Daily Traffic of Project Expressway \n(passenger car units) \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \nRoad Section \nYucheng-Yingjing \nYingjing-Jiuxiang \nJiuxiang-Hanyuan \nHanyuan-Shimian \nShimian-Liziping \nLiziping-Mianning \nMianning-\u2013Lugu \nWeighted Average \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultants. \n\n \n2021 \n30,094 \n23,210 \n21,411 \n20,751 \n18,009 \n16,927 \n17,712 \n20,495 \n\n2011 \n14,686  \n11,744  \n10,894  \n10,734  \n9,551  \n9,140  \n9,464  \n10,615  \n\nGrowth \nRate (%) \n7.4 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n6.8 \n6.5 \n6.4 \n6.5 \n6.8 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n2030 \n51,526 \n39,174 \n35,994 \n34,410 \n29,469 \n27,456 \n28,820 \n34,043 \n\nGrowth \nRate (%) \n6.2 \n6.0 \n5.9 \n5.8 \n5.6 \n5.5 \n5.6 \n5.8 \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nThe project expressway traverses central Sichuan Province. Local roads are connected \nto  the  expressway  through  the  road  network  system.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the  26 \nyears of construction and operation. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project \nwas  estimated  by  comparing  the  situation  with  and  without  the  Project.  Without  the  Project, \ntraffic will use the existing road network, which will be congested and expensive to maintain due \nto  the  rapidly  increasing  volume  of  traffic.  Some  travel  may  not  take  place  because  of  the \ncongestion and  the  resulting  increasing  travel  times  and  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs).  With \nthe Project, congestion on the existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on the expressway and \nthe  existing  roads  will  benefit  from  faster,  cheaper,  and  safer  travel.  Additional  trips  will  be \ngenerated as the economy responds to lower transport costs and better service. \n \n2. \nAlternative  Analysis.  As  part  of  economic  analysis,  possible  alternative  interventions \nwere  considered  to  meet  the  growing  transport  demand  in  the  project  area  as  part  of  the \nnational and provincial transport network plan. Alternative analysis reviewed various options in \nterms  of  transport  modes,  alignments,  technical  designs,  timing  of  investments,  and  financing \nmodalities. While  enhancing  the  existing  railway  capacity  may  be  an  option  to  partly  meet  the \nincreasing  demand,  it  will  not  completely  satisfy  the  various  kinds  of  traffic,  particularly  high-\nvalue general cargo that requires a more flexible and responsive mode to meet the needs of a \nmarket  economy.  Six  alternative  alignments  were  reviewed  based  on  geologic  and \ntopographical conditions, terrain considerations, consultations with community representatives, \ncost  estimates,  relative  impacts  on  environment  and  resettlement,  and  integration  with  the \nnational  and  local  transport  network.  The  expressway  technical  design  was  proposed  after \nconsideration  of  the  national  highway  network,  consistency  in  the  standards  of  contiguous \nsections  at  each  end  of  the  project  expressway,  and  forecast  traffic.  Alternative  financing \nmodalities  were  considered,  including  private  sector  investment.  However,  private  sector \ninvestment was not found attractive due to risks associated with construction and low estimated \nrates of return. Hence, public financing was considered appropriate. \n \n3. \nGeneral  Parameters.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  constant  2005 \neconomic prices. The prices are expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire, with a \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.013 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to \nplace  an  economic  value  on  the  wages  paid  to  unskilled  labor,  while  skilled  labor  was  not \nshadow priced since there is no surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 \nwas used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor. \n \n4. \nCosts.  The  capital  costs  and  physical  contingencies  for  the  Project  are  revalued  at \neconomic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable  materials,  labor,  and  land.  The  land  and  resettlement  costs  were  based  on  their \nopportunity costs, i.e., agricultural output forgone and re-siting of displaced activities. \n \n5. \nBenefits. The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs resulting from the reduced \ntravel distance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time and of \nfreight  tied  up  in  transit,  (iii) savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents,  (iv) benefits  to  generated \ntraffic,  and  (v) savings  in  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  for  National \nHighway (NH) 108. A reduction in VOCs is the main source of economic benefits for the Project. \nTraffic diverting to the expressway would travel at high, more economical speeds on a smoother \nroad,  with  better  vertical  and  horizontal  alignment,  less  congestion,  and  a  shorter  journey \ndistance. Traffic remaining on the alternative NH108 route would also benefit from a reduction in \ntraffic volume and congestion. All these changes affect vehicle speeds and VOCs, which were \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47\n\nestimated for all vehicle types likely to use the corridor. Savings in travel time will be seen both \non  the  project  expressway  and  the  existing  roads.  Work-related  travel  time  was  evaluated  for \nprivate  vehicles  and  buses.  The  economic  cost  of  accidents  was  estimated  on  direct  property \ndamage and foregone income. \n \n6. \nSix  hundred  seventy-eight  km  of  local  roads  will  be  improved  concurrently  with  the \nexpressway component. The costs of this component include capital costs and O&M costs. The \nprincipal  benefits  of  the  local  road  improvements  were  identified  as  reduced  VOCs  and  the \nproducer  surplus  (the  value  of  additional  production  minus  production  costs).  Transport  cost \nsavings will accrue to normal traffic on the improved roads. The local roads recommended for \nupgrading  were  chosen  based  on  poverty  incidence,  the  effect  on  overall  road  network \nefficiency, economic development potential, and population density. \n \n7. \nResult  and  Conclusion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project, \nincluding the expressway and local road components, is 15.2% (Table A12.1). The EIRR for the \nexpressway component alone is 15.2%, and for the local road component, 15.9%. VOC savings \nare  the  major  economic  benefit  (78%),  followed  by  travel  time  savings  (13%),  local  road \ncomponent (3%), and accident cost savings (3%). \n \n8. \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic \nviability:  changes  in  the  key  variables\u2014construction  costs,  benefits,  traffic  growth,  residual \nvalue, and 1-year delay in completion\u2014do not significantly affect the economic viability (Table \nA12.2). The capital cost would have to be 61% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below \nthe  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the  experience  of  ADB  in  the  PRC,  such  an  increase  in \ncapital cost is unlikely. ADB-financed road projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost \noverruns,  and  the  contract  prices  tend  to  be  lower  than  estimated  because  the  contracting \nprocess  is  becoming  increasingly  competitive.  The  benefit  level  would  have  to  decrease  more \nthan  38%  to  make  the  Project  economically  nonviable.  A  risk  analysis  was  carried  out  to \ndetermine  the  degree  of  uncertainty  on  the  Project.  Each  uncertainty  factor  (such  as  capital \ncost, traffic growth, and VOC value) was varied at random within the limits. The results showed \nthat an EIRR exceeding 12% will be achieved with a 95% probability. The economic analysis of \nthe  Project  was  extended  to  analyze  distribution  of  project  net  benefits  by  determining  the \nproject effects for various beneficiaries, including road users (passenger and freight), labor, and \ngovernment. It was found that road users will receive the largest share of net benefit, accounting \nfor 93% of the total net benefits (Table A12.3). \n \n\n\fTime \nSavings\n\nAccident \nSavings\n\nGenerated \nTraffic \n\nDiversion \nFrom Rail\n\nLocal \nRoads\n\nTotal \n\nNet  Benefit \n\nBenefits \n\nFreight \nTransit \nSavings \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2005 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n \n\nYear \n\nWithout \nProject \nRoad \nCosts \n\nCosts \nWith Project Costs \nOperation  \nand \nMaintenance \n\n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n36.3 \n38.2 \n40.2 \n42.3 \n44.5 \n46.9 \n49.3 \n51.9 \n54.6 \n57.5 \n58.4 \n59.3 \n60.3 \n61.3 \n62.4 \n63.5 \n64.6 \n65.9 \n67.2 \n68.5 \n69.9 \n\nCapital \n\n  1,150.5 \n  2,816.6 \n  3,094.9 \n  2,680.4 \n  2,252.3 \n  1,899.7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     347.8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     284.9 \n(8,197.7) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n17.8 \n73.7 \n76.3 \n79.0 \n81.8 \n84.7 \n87.7 \n90.9 \n94.2 \n270.0 \n101.1 \n104.8 \n108.6 \n112.6 \n116.7 \n121.0 \n125.5 \n130.1 \n135.0 \n140.0 \n145.2 \n\nLocal \nRoads \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n\n108.0 \n270.0 \n162.0 \n0.3 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n       1.2 \n(270.0) \n \n \n\n1,150.5  \n2,816.6  \n3,202.9  \n2,950.4  \n2,414.3  \n1,881.5  \n36.7  \n37.3  \n37.9  \n38.5  \n39.0  \n39.6  \n40.2  \n40.7  \n561.6  \n43.9  \n46.7  \n49.5  \n52.5  \n55.6  \n58.8  \n62.1  \n65.5  \n69.0  \n       357.5  \n \n (8,363.7)\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nVehicle \nOperating \nCost \nSavings \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n   280.2 \n1,254.3 \n1,400.4 \n1,563.6 \n1,745.7 \n1,949.1 \n2,176.2 \n2,429.7 \n2,712.8 \n3,028.8 \n3,381.7 \n3,702.9 \n4,054.7 \n4,439.9 \n4,861.7 \n5,323.5 \n5,829.3 \n6,383.1 \n6,989.4 \n7,653.4 \n8,380.5 \n\n \n \n\n44.7\n200.3\n223.6\n249.7\n278.8\n311.3\n347.5\n388.0\n433.2\n483.7\n540.0\n591.3\n647.5\n709.0\n776.4\n850.1\n930.9\n1,019.3\n1,116.1\n1,222.2\n1,338.3\n \n \n\nCNY = yuan. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and TA consultants estimates.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n12.8 \n55.1 \n59.0 \n63.3 \n67.9 \n72.8 \n78.0 \n83.6 \n89.7 \n96.1 \n102.4 \n109.1 \n116.2 \n123.8 \n131.8 \n140.5 \n149.6 \n159.4 \n169.8 \n180.9 \n192.7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n7.0 \n31.4 \n35.1 \n39.1 \n43.7 \n48.8 \n54.5 \n60.8 \n67.9 \n75.8 \n84.7 \n92.7 \n101.5 \n111.1 \n121.7 \n133.3 \n145.9 \n159.8 \n175.0 \n191.6 \n209.8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   370.5 \n15.2 \n1,650.4 \n66.2 \n1,834.4 \n72.0 \n2,039.6 \n78.4 \n2,268.2 \n85.3 \n2,522.9 \n92.8 \n2,806.9 \n101.0 \n3,123.3 \n109.9 \n3,476.0 \n119.5 \n3,869.1 \n130.0 \n4,307.1 \n141.4 \n4,709.0 \n153.7 \n5,148.6 \n167.0 \n5,629.6 \n181.6 \n6,155.9 \n197.4 \n6,731.7 \n214.5 \n7,361.6 \n233.1 \n8,050.9 \n253.4 \n8,805.1 \n275.4 \n299.3 \n9,630.4 \n325.4  10,533.5 \nEconomic Net Present Value = \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return = \n\n  9.7 \n39.5 \n40.2 \n41.0 \n41.8 \n42.6 \n43.4 \n44.3 \n45.1 \n46.0 \n47.3 \n48.7 \n50.1 \n51.5 \n53.0 \n54.5 \n56.0 \n57.7 \n59.3 \n61.0 \n62.7 \n\n0.8 \n3.6 \n4.0 \n4.5 \n5.0 \n5.6 \n6.2 \n7.0 \n7.8 \n8.7 \n9.7 \n10.6 \n11.6 \n12.7 \n14.0 \n15.3 \n16.7 \n18.3 \n20.1 \n22.0 \n24.1 \n\n4\n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(1,150.5) \n(2,816.6) \n(3,202.9) \n(2,950.4) \n(2,414.3) \n(1,511.0) \n1,613.7 \n1,797.2 \n2,001.7 \n2,229.7 \n2,483.9 \n2,767.2 \n3,083.1 \n3,435.3 \n3,307.6 \n4,263.2 \n4,662.3 \n5,099.1 \n5,577.1 \n6,100.3 \n6,672.9 \n7,299.6 \n7,985.4 \n8,736.1 \n9,272.9 \n18,925.9 \nCNY4,013.5 \n15.2% \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n49\n\nScenario \n\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\nChange \n(%) \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nEconomic Net \nPresent Value \n(CNY million) \n\nSwitching \nValuea \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBase Case \n1.

Construction  will  be  completed  in \nSeptember 2011, and the first year of full operation will be 2012. The foreign and local inflation \nrates  are  assumed  at  2%  and  3%  during  the  projection  period.  The  cost  estimates  are \npresented  in  current  terms  taking  into  account  the  potential  impacts  of  domestic  and \ninternational inflation.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nOperating  revenues  from  tolls  are  projected  based  on  forecast  of  future  traffic  and  a \nbase  toll  rate  of  CNY0.35  per  passenger  car  per  kilometer  (km).  Corresponding  tolls  for  other \nvehicle types are CNY0.70 for a small bus or a light truck; CNY1.05 for a medium-sized bus or \ntruck; CNY1.40 for a large bus or truck, and CNY1.75 for an articulated truck or a trailer.1 The \ntoll  charges  are  assumed  to  increase  in  current  terms  once  every  5  years  to  keep  up  with \ninflation.  There  would  be  no  real  increase  of  project  tolls  over  project  life  span.  A  set  of \nexpressway  and  tunnel  tolls  was  devised  in  conjunction  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) diversion curves, and to achieve close to optimum financial and economic performance. \nOther income (from fuel sales, rental income, etc) amounts to 1.5% of toll revenue.  \n \n3.  \nAnnual  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  are  calculated  based  on \n2005 prices as follows: (i) toll operation cost totaled an estimated CNY10.7 million in 2011 (269 \nstaff members with annual average wages and other costs of CNY31,500). Labor costs will rise \nat a growth rate of 4% in real terms, and staff numbers will increase with traffic flows using an \nelasticity of 0.05; (ii) routine maintenance costs are estimated at CNY50,000 per km per year; \nand  it  will  increase  in  line  with  traffic  flows  using  an  elasticity  of  0.3;  (iii)  tunnel  operating  and \nmaintenance expenses account for about 60% of total O&M expenses in the opening year. The \ncosts  of  ventilating  the  longest  tunnels  account  for  about  half  of  tunnel  operating  and \nmaintenance  costs;  and  (iv)  environmental  monitoring  costs  CNY740,000  per  year.  All \nincremental O&M costs are projected to increase annually in line with domestic inflation rates. In \naddition,  periodic  maintenance  would  be  required  after  10  years  of  operation  at  a  cost  of \nCNY1.4 million per km in 2005 prices and CNY2.2 million in 2020 prices. \n\nDepreciation is calculated on a declining balance depreciation method with an average \n4. \nlife of about 50 years of the main expressway structure, 20 years of pavement component, and \n15 years for equipment. \n\nApplicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are charged on revenue.  Corporate income \n5. \ntax  at  15%  is  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes, 2  depreciation  and  interest \ncharges, operating expenses and any prior year losses carried forward.   \n\nThe Project will be funded 45% by equity or grants, 55% by long-term loans. The China \n6. \nDevelopment Bank (CDB) loan will be repayable over 26 years, including a 6-year grace period. \nFor  the  ADB\u2019s  loan,  it  is  assumed  as  26-year  maturity,  including  a  6-year  grace  period,  US \n\n                                                 \n1   The  toll  rates  proposed  and  their  structures  are  consistent  both  with  trends  of  Sichuan  practice  and  tolls  on  the \n\nexisting, adjacent stretch of expressway. \n\n2  Concessionary rate for qualifying western region companies, including the project expressway. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n51\n\ndollar  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan.  In  addition,  there  is  a  0.75% \ncommitment fee.  \n\n7. \nProjected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Table  A13.1.  The  projected  financial \nstatements  indicate  the  forecast  revenue  under  the  base  assumptions  are  sufficient  to  cover \nannual  recurrent  costs,  depreciation,  debt  repayments  on  the  ADB  and  CDB  loans,  and \ngenerate reasonable profits from the expressway operation. \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n8. \nThe major assumptions used for calculation of a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare the following: (i) all calculations are made in 2005 prices, covering 2006 to 2031; (ii) capital \ncosts include all incremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for \nthe  expressway,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  O&M \ncosts  include  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but \nexclude  depreciation  and  debt  repayment  provisions;  (iv)  operating  revenues  from  toll  used  in \nfinancial projections are also adjusted to 2005 prices; (v) the residual value of the expressway \nwas estimated based on the weighted depreciation value of 2.4% per year.  \n\n9. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after  tax,  in  real  terms  was \ncalculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  costs  of  funds.  Costs  have  been  considered  as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.60% is \nused for ADB debt; (ii) the estimated interest costs of 5.76% per annum is used for the domestic \nloan  funds;  and  (iii)  the  cost  of  equity  was  assumed  to  be  8.00%.  The  cost  of  debt  is  also \nadjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 15%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the \nreal cost of debt by applying domestic and international average inflation rate for domestic and \nforeign currency denominated debt respectively.  \n \nThe project FIRR, computed after tax, is 5.4%. This compares favorably with the WACC, \n10. \nalso computed after tax, of 3.9% (Table A13.2). The Project is considered financially viable and \nsustainable.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  conditions  causing  the  Project's  viability  to  fall  below \nWACC  are  unlikely  to  occur.  The  sensitivity  of  the  Project's  financial  indicators  to  cost  and \nrevenue variations is shown in Table A13.3. \n\n \n\n\fItem\n\nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nContributions will be mainly through improved linkage to market and improved access to external jobs and \nsocial services for the poor; lower transport costs of agricultural inputs and products; better access to and \ninteraction  with  other  regions,  and  jobs  during  construction  and  after  completion,  owing  to  increased \neconomic activities. Specifically, the Project\u2019s local road component of 678 kilometers (km) will help local \npeople to break the transport bottleneck and therefore add economic value to their fruits, vegetables, and \nanimals that have been introduced by various poverty reduction, minority redevelopment and agricultural \ndevelopment programs. The expressway, especially interchange areas, and local roads will speed up the \ndevelopment of mineral and tourism resources and facilitate the formation of new local growth centers that \nwill have greater impact on poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nOne  hundred  sixty-eight  (23.6%)  and  118  (16.5%)  villages,  out  of  713,  are  provincial  and  county \ndesignated poverty villages, respectively. About 273,000 rural and urban poor will directly benefit from the \nproject, accounting for 29% of the total beneficiaries. 253,000 out of the total poor beneficiaries are rural \npoor, which is 93% of total poor beneficiaries and 34% of total rural beneficiaries. In addition, 28,000 rural \npoor, out of 80,000 population in total, from two indirect project counties will benefit from the local roads. \nThe  project will  directly  generate  economic opportunities  for  the poor  through  improved  access  to  urban \nmarkets  and  to  other  social  services,  reduced  transport  costs,  and  better  access  to  and  interaction  with \nother regions. Directly and indirectly, through the promotion of agricultural commercialization and of local \nlevel urbanization, the project will contribute to the effectiveness of poverty reduction effects achieved and \nto be achieved. In addition, a social development action plan (SDAP) was prepared to enhance the project \nbenefits to the poor and ethnic minorities along the alignment and the broader project area, such as local \nmineral and tourism development.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  done  during  the  feasibility  study  and  roles  of  each  stakeholder  are  well \ndefined.  The  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  is  the  Executing  Agency  and  is \nresponsible  for  fundraising  and  overall  supervision;  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  is  responsible  for \nimplementation  of  construction  activities  and  then  the  operation  of  the  project  expressway.  The  local \ncounty  and  township  governments  and  communities  will  assist  the  IA  in  land  acquisition,  the \nimplementation  of  a  resettlement  plan,  and  the  organization  of  local  labor  for  expressway  construction. \nWith  support  from  SPCD,  the  IA  will  also  upgrade  678  km  of  local  roads  for  poor  communities  in \nconsultations with the local communities. All stakeholders will take part in implementing SDAP.  \nSPCD and the technical assistance (TA) consultants have undertaken socioeconomic surveys and public \nmeetings,  which  have  raised  the  level  of  awareness  and  gained  local  support.  These  processes  have \nenabled the local stakeholders to express their opinions and to make relevant suggestions for expressway \nand  local  road  designs  (e.g.,  locations  of  crossings)  and  implementation.  Specifically,  intensive \nconsultation  of  rural  poor,  women,  and  minority  population  was  carried  out  during  TA  socioeconomic \nsurvey on project impact and local road selection. The participatory activities are an ongoing process that \nwill  continue  during  project  implementation.  The  poor,  women,  and  minority  people  will  be  further \nconsulted during project implementation. \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55\n\n   Yes              \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \nFor the inclusion and selection of unskilled labor in the project area during construction, the contractors will \ndiscuss  their  requirements  with  villagers  along  the  expressway,  and  train  them  as  needed.  During  the \nselection of the expressway alignment, local leaders from the project-affected villages and townships will \nbe consulted further in order to minimize the loss of high-quality arable land and structures. For the local \nroad component, local villagers will provide unskilled  labor at local market rates. Township governments \nand community organizations will be involved in the implementation of the village economic rehabilitation \ncomponent of the resettlement plan. \n\n   No \n\nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThere are gender differences in the division of labor as in many other regions. Men are mainly employed in \noutside and heavy physical activities and as migrant workers, while women are responsible for household \nchores  and  cropping  activities.  Women\u2019s  role  in  household  and  community  decision  making  varies  from \nplace to place and is improving although still limited. Of all the women surveyed, 85%, 2%, and 13%, felt \nsatisfied,  unsatisfied  and  unclear,  respectively,  about  their  current  status.  As  in  other  parts  of  the  PRC, \nurban  and  roadside  communities  have  less  obvious  differences  between  women  and  men  in  division  of \nlabor and decision making. Therefore the project, especially the local roads, will enhance women\u2019s role in \ngeneral. As part of the participation strategy, priority will be given to women for direct and indirect project \nbenefits,  which  are  included  in  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  and  SDAP.  Gender \ndisaggregated  indicators  will  be  monitored  in  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  To  prevent  an \nincreased risk of HIV/AIDS1 infection associated with the Project, the centers for disease control (CDCs) \nagreed  to  extend  their  preventive  measures  to  the  construction  sites  of  the  road  project,  including \nprovisions of HIV test kits, condoms, education, posters, leaflets, and regular services such as monitoring \nand  surveillance,  focusing  on  the  construction  workers.  In  carrying  out  the  civil  works  contracts,  the \nImplementation Methods of Epidemic Prevention Law will be followed. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

A  draft  resettlement  plan  based  on  the \nfeasibility study estimates was prepared by SPCD in \nline  with \nthe  1998  Land  Administration  Law, \nprovincial  guidelines,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement. A resettlement information \nbooklet  was  disseminated  to  affected  people.  After \npreliminary  design,  an  updated  RP,  taking  into \naccount  the  feedback  from  affected  people  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for approval. About 20,237 people \nwill  be  affected  by  land  acquisition,  of  whom  2,634 \npeople  will  lose  either  their  houses  or  buildings. \nThose  losing  land  will  be  compensated  through \nvillage \nreallocation.  The  Project  will \npermanently acquire about 1,477 hectares of land.  \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  found  that  most  local \npeople could generally afford the transport services. \nWith improvement of the local roads, more transport \nservices at lower cost will be available to the poor. \n\nland \n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n Yes \n No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n                                                           \n1 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n  \nItem \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\nLabor \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Yes \n No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nlabor \n\nproject \n\neconomic \n\nimplementation, \n\nopportunities.  However, \n\nDuring \ncivil  works \ncontractors  will  maximize  the  employment  of  local \npoor  people  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency \nrequirements  for  construction  of  the  project  roads. \nSuch  workers  will  be  trained  on  the  job.  SPCD  will \nensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor legislation.

The \nproject  will  not  have  significant  adverse  impact  on \nminority people, other than resettlement. Many local \nroads  target  minority  villages,  which  will  increase \nin \nthe \nconsideration of the vulnerable status of the minority \npopulation,  especially  the  Yi,  an  EMDP  has  been \nprepared.

A  full  EMDP  is  available  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K.  The \nEMDP is based on the resettlement plan, the social and poverty assessment, and consultation \nwith  ethnic  minority  groups,  and  local  county  governments  and  their  line  agencies.  This  plan \nprimarily  targets  the  project-affected  Yi  minority,  who  account  for  about  86%  (138,000)  of  the \ntotal minority population.  \n \n2. \nThe  Yi  are  the  poorest  in  the  project  area.  A  field  survey  indicated  that  (i)  the  poverty \nincidence  (average  per  capita  annual  income  of  under  CNY900)  among  the  surveyed  Yi \ncommunities is 45%, while it is 17% for the Han; (ii) the average per capita annual income of the \nsurveyed  Yi  villages  is  CNY975,  while  it  is  CNY1,450  for  the  Han;  and  (iii)  only  4%  of  Yi \nhouseholds have a motor vehicle, compared to 28% for the Han. The education level for the Yi \nis lower than for the Han. The adult illiteracy rate of the Yi, for instance, is as high as 35%, while \nthat of the Han is 5%. Migration to local mines and construction sites is common for both the Yi \nand Han in recent years. However, the Han also seek migration work in other regions while the \nYi do not. While the Han migrate from rural to major urban areas to find off-farm jobs, they are \nunlikely  to  migrate  to  the  project  area  because  it  has  no  new  permanent  jobs,  only  temporary \njobs in road construction. The project area is an area of narrow corridors and high mountains, \nwith no potential for large-scale industrial development. Population growth during 1995\u20132000 in \nthe project area was 0.06% to 1.53%. No HIV/AIDS1 cases were reported in the project counties. \nAround 24,400 expressway construction workers will go to the project area and will interact with \nlocal  minority  population,  increasing  its  risk  of  exposure  to  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted \ninfections. \n \n3. \nSurveys identified 1,918 ethnic minority households (6,790 people) from 38 villages in 15 \ntownships that would be affected by land acquisition (34% of total project-affected people), and \n141 ethnic minority households (472 people) would be affected by house displacement (18% of \ntotal).  The  project-affected  minority  households  are  all  Yi.  Resettlement  impact  of  ethnic \nminorities is addressed in the resettlement plan. \n \nTo mitigate possible adverse impacts and enhance positive impacts on the Yi minority, \n4. \nthe  government  will  implement  measures  shown  in  Table  A15.  The  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (SPCD), \nthe  country  governments,  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  EMDP.  SPCD  will  engage  a  domestic  agency  to  conduct \nindependent monitoring and evaluation and submit reports to the Asian Development Bank. \n\ntogether  with \n\n \nTable A15: Mitigation Measures  \n\nTargets/Indicators \n\nBeneficiaries \n\nProhibiting nighttime \nconstruction \nBuilding of 383 grade separated \ncrossings \nReconstruction of damaged \nirrigation and drainage systems \n\nOver 180,000 minority \npeople from 503 sub-villages \nof 70 villages \n\nBudget \n (CNY '000) \n\nTiming \n\nIncluded in \nthe project \nenvironmental \nimpact \nassessment \n\n2006\u20132010 \n\n                                                 \n1 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \nProposed \nMeasures  \n\nProtection of \nminority \ncommunities from \nconstruction \ndisturbances \n\n \n\n\fProposed \nMeasures  \n\n \nTargets/Indicators \n\nBeneficiaries \n\nBudget  \n(CNY '000) \n\nTiming \n\n58 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nControl of \ntransmissible \ndiseases \n\nEncourage women \nto participate in \nmeetings and \ndecisions \n\n \n\nSpecial support to \nresettlement \naffected people \n\nHealth clinics in construction \ncamps \nHIV/AIDS and STI prevention \nposters \nHIV/AIDS and STI education \nprograms \nImplementation of the \ninternational anti-AIDS programs\nZero case of HIV/AIDS in the \nproject areas during the \nconstruction period \n\nNumber of meetings \nNumber of newsletters \n\n1% of total resettlement budget \nto be reserved for vulnerable \ngroups \nOptions for affected households \nto selected new settlement sites \n6 months notice time for project-\naffected households to select \nnew resettlement sites \naccording to their specific \ntradition \nEmployment skill training by \nminority trainers \nRefunding land reclamation and \nforestry taxes to affected \ncounties \n\nMinority residents in PA, \nespecially along the \nexpressway \n \nOver 20,000 migrant \nconstruction workers \n\nIncluded in \nthe project \n\n2006\u20132010 \n\nOver 90,000 minority women \nfrom 503 sub-villages of 70 \nvillages. \n\nIncluded in \nGovernment \nprogram \n\n2006\u20132010 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,100 ethnic minority \nhouseholds (8,100 persons) \nin Mianning and Shimian \ncounties \n\n2006\u20132007 \n\nIncluded in \nresettlement \nplan.

The  resettlement  plan1 covers  both \ncomponents  based  on  the  feasibility  study.  The  proposed  Yalu  expressway  (including \nconnecting  roads)  will  affect  29  townships  and  93  administrative  villages  in  five  counties: \nYucheng,  Yingjing,  Hanyuan,  and  Shimian  in  Ya\u2019an  municipality;  and  Mianning  in  Liangshan \nPrefecture.  The  local  road  program  involves  upgrading  the  existing  county  to  township  and \ntownship to village roads, so it is not expected to involve a significant amount of land acquisition \nand  resettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  revised  after  completion  of  the  preliminary \ndesign,  including  village  rehabilitation  plans,  and  submitted  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) for approval prior to commencement of land acquisition. \n\n2. \nFor the expressway, 1,466 hectares (ha) will be permanently acquired, of which 21% is \npaddy,  35%  dryland,  15%  orchard,  15%  forestland,  1%  housing  plots,  and  13%  wasteland. \nAnother  347.6  ha  will  be  occupied  temporarily  during  construction.  Based  on  per  capita \nfarmland  in  affected  villages,  farmland  acquisition  will  be  equivalent  to  20,237  people  (5,711 \nhouseholds)  losing  all  their  farmland.  It  is  expected  that  the  average  loss  of  farmland  per \nhousehold  will  be  25%;  94,800  square  meters  (m2)  of  houses  will  be  demolished,  requiring \nrelocation of 790 households (2,634 people). About 70% of houses are made of brick and wood, \nand earth and wood, and 30% are brick and concrete. Most of these households will be moved \na  short  distance  within  their  original  village.  All  land,  housing,  and  other  assets  will  be \ncompensated at replacement value.  \n\n3. \nFor people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome  and  living  standards  in  line  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Land \nAdministration  Law  (1998)  and  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The  Sichuan \nProvincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  will  ensure  that  any  people  losing  land, \nhousing, other assets, or income sources will be assisted to fully restore their income and living \nstandards.  A  comprehensive  compensation  rate  (for  land  compensation,  resettlement  subsidy, \nand cost of young crops) has been estimated at CNY480,000 per ha for irrigated farmland, and \nCNY300,000 per ha for dry land. Those losing land temporarily during construction will receive a \npayment equivalent to production value foregone for the period of loss, which is expected to be \n2  years.  The  land  used  temporarily  will  also  be  restored  by  the  contractor  to  the  original \ncondition.  For  structures  to  be  demolished,  replacement  value  will  be  provided  to  the  affected \nhouseholds based on compensation rates adopted in affected city and prefecture, which range \nfrom CNY350 to CNY450/m2 for brick and concrete structures, CNY280 to CNY340/m2 for brick-\nwood  structure,  and  CNY220  to  CNY260/m2  for  earth  and  wood  structures.  Those  losing \nhousing will be compensated for their housing plot, equivalent to the rate for irrigated farmland, \nso  they  can  acquire  new  housing  sites  close  to  a  road  and  with  electricity  and  water  in  their \nvillage  group  or  administrative  village.  Housing  compensation  will  not  be  reduced  for \ndepreciation,  and  people  will  be  allowed  to  salvage  materials  from  their  old  houses.  Efforts  to \nminimize resettlement effects have been made after consultations with local officials during the \nsetting  of  the  alignment  for  the  feasibility  study  to  avoid  towns,  villages,  and  high-yield  paddy \nand fruit gardens.  \n\n4. \nIn the project area, the per capita land holding is very small (less than 0.05 ha), so land \nacquisition  will  have  significant  impact  on  the  income  and  livelihood  of  the  project-affected \n\n                                                 \n1 The \nare \n\nresettlement \n\nplans \n\nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/PRC/Sichuan-Roads-Development/default.asp. \n\nin  English \n\nand  Chinese \n\nand \n\navailable \n\non  ADB\u2019s  website: \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\npeople.  To  mitigate  such  impacts,  higher-than-average  compensation  rates  are  provided  and \ndetailed  economic  rehabilitation  plans  for  seriously  affected  villages  will  be  developed.  All \nproject-affected  people  will  either  be  compensated  directly  or,  if  preferred,  given  replacement \nland  through  village  land  readjustment  to  ensure  that  all  project-affected  households  have \nsufficient land to farm. Project-affected people will use the compensation funds to improve farm \nconditions,  develop  cash  crops,  and  various  nonfarm  activities  based  on  consultation.  The \nresettlement  entitlements  will  be  provided  to  people  before  ground  clearance  and  demolition. \nThe resettlement plan provides for moving allowances to assist the affected people during the \ntransition.  Expressway  contractors  will  be  requested  by  SPCD  to  give  priority  to  resettlement-\naffected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction.  \n\n5. \nA  project  resettlement  office  (PRO)  within  SPCD  and/or  the  Implementing  Agency  will \ncoordinate  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  reporting  of  resettlement  for  the \nexpressway, connector roads, and local poverty roads. Leading groups and resettlement offices, \neach  comprising  6\u20138  staff  members,  will  be  established  in  two  cities  and  five  project-affected \ncounties.  The  county  resettlement  offices  will  take  primary  responsibility  for  the  consultation, \nimplementation,  and  timely  delivery  of  entitlements,  with  assistance  from  concerned  township \nand villages. Land acquisition will commence by January 2006 and be completed by December \n2006. Housing demolition and relocation will be carried out from March 2006 to December 2006. \n\nAn  estimated  4,500  Yi  people  will  be  affected  by  the  Project  (22%  of  the  total \n6. \npopulation). Among the 93 project-affected villages, 38 have over 10% Yi. Although the Yi have \nbeen closely integrated into the social system with no distinctive isolation or barriers, in order to \nrespect their cultural customs and maintain their social relationships, all project-affected minority \npeople  will  be  resettled  in  the  same  villages  and  village  groups.  For  economically  vulnerable \npeople,  including  the  Yi,  the  elderly  living  alone,  the  disabled,  households  headed  by  women, \nand extremely poor households with incomes below CNY675 per year, the Project will provide \nadditional financial and physical support. Households that face hardships will receive additional \nassistance  to  ensure  they  can  fully  restore  their  livelihoods  and  living  conditions  in  a  timely \nmanner.  For  this  purpose,  the  resettlement  plan  includes  a  special  fund  with  1.0%  to  1.5%  of \ntotal resettlement cost.  \n\nThe  PRC  Land  Law  and  regulations  require  disclosure  and  consultation  with  people \n7. \naffected.  The  people  affected  have  been  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  resettlement \nplan  during  meetings  and  interviews.  A  resettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to  all \nproject-affected townships and villages in February 2005. The information booklet contains the \nresettlement scope, expected time frame, compensation rates for land and other assets, other \nassistance  to  replace  assets,  relocation  and  economic  rehabilitation  strategies,  and  grievance \nredress  mechanisms. During  detailed  resettlement  planning,  there  will  be  further  consultations \narranged by township and village officials to discuss specific impacts in each village and how to \naddress them. In case of grievance, all complaints will be processed based on the Government \nRegulation 431 on Grievance and Redress.  \n\n8. \nSPCD  will  engage  a  qualified  domestic  monitoring  agency  to  carry  out  independent \nresettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  the  project-affected \npeople  have  (i)  received  their  full  entitlements  on  time;  and  (ii)  fully  restored  their  livelihoods, \nincome levels, and living standards. The independent monitoring agency will provide ADB and \nSPCD with copies of the monitoring and evaluation reports to be prepared twice a year during \nresettlement  implementation  and  once  a  year  after  resettlement  completion.  A  monitoring  and \nsupervision system will be established in the PRO of the SPCD or Implementing Agency and will \nreport progress to ADB quarterly. After completion of land acquisition and resettlement, SPCD or \nthe Implementing Agency will prepare a resettlement completion report and submit it to ADB. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 August 2005)  \n", " \n \n \n \n \nThe  exchange  rate  of  the  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate  system.
