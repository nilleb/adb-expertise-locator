I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Power System Efficiency Improvement Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will address two key areas in the electricity supply industry in Bangladesh \nwhich suffers from acute power shortages: (i) replacing energy-inefficient thermal power plants; \nand (ii) expanding renewable energy. The project includes (i) replacing five aging generating \nunits with a combined capacity of 274 megawatts (MW) at Ashuganj power station with an \nefficient combined cycle power plant (CCPP) of 450 MW using natural gas as the fuel source; \n(ii) installing a 5 MW solar photovoltaic system connected to the national grid at Kaptai; (iii) \ninstalling a hybrid wind (1 MW)\u2013solar photovoltaic (1 MW)\u2013diesel (5.5 MW) generating system \nin Hatiya; and (iv) installing or retrofitting streetlights that use photovoltaic and light-emitting \ndiode (LED) technology in the cities of Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and \nSylhet. These subprojects will help Bangladesh to embark on a program of energy efficiency, \nsource diversification, and reduced dependence on imported fuels.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.   Energy shortage is the most critical infrastructure constraint on Bangladesh\u2019s economic \ngrowth. In 2011, the maximum demand for electricity is 6,000 MW, which is expected to rise to \n7,000  MW  by  2013.  But  the  maximum  available  generation  is  4,500\u20134,750  MW  (from  an \ninstalled capacity of 5,719 MW), leaving a significant supply gap. The main causes for the \nsupply shortage are (i) the poor operational efficiency of thermal power plants and inefficient \nuse of energy; (ii) inadequate supplies of natural gas, which is the primary source of energy for \nelectricity generation; (iii) slow progress on cross-border energy cooperation; and (iv) lack of \ndiversification in energy supply, including inadequate exploitation of renewable energy. These \nissues were highlighted in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2009 Bangladesh energy sector \nassistance program evaluation (SAPE).3 \n \n4.  The government\u2019s declared vision for the power sector in 2010 is to eliminate load \nshedding  beyond  2010  and  to  make  electricity  available  to  all  by  2021.  The  government \nestimated that realizing this vision would require an additional 9,000 MW of generating capacity \ninstalled by the end of 2015. Of this, 5,400 MW of generation capacity would be added by the \nprivate sector. Since the declaration of this policy, 586 MW of generating capacity has been \nadded to the system and additional approvals have been granted for new power plants. Other \ninitiatives aim to diversify energy sources by developing coal resources, renewable energy, and \ncross-border cooperation.  \n \n5.  SAPE has concluded that ADB\u2019s contribution to the development of the Bangladesh \npower sector has been significant and successful. One of the key recommendations of SAPE is \npromoting energy efficiency, the main intervention in the proposed project.3  ADB\u2019s country \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Sector Assistance Program Evaluation: Energy Sector in Bangladesh. Manila. \n ", "2   \npartnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh4 emphasizes  (i)  investments  in  energy  efficiency  and \nnetwork expansion; (ii) continuing policy dialogue on energy pricing and creating an enabling \nenvironment for private sector participation; and (iii) regional cooperation. ADB is strengthening \nits efforts toward clean energy investments through public\u2013private partnerships. As a part of this \nstrategy, ADB approved a loan to facilitate the flow of 500 MW from India to Bangladesh \nthrough  an  electricity  transmission  interconnection  on  Bangladesh\u2019s  western  border5.  The \nproposed  project  will  supplement  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  assist  Bangladesh  in  eliminating  supply \nshortages.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the project will be increased provision of better access to electricity. The \noutcome will be increased generating capacity. The capacity to generate 176 MW will be added \nby installing a CCPP to replace some aging, inefficient plants. Further, the project will support \nexpanding renewable energy in the country by installing solar photovoltaic and wind power \nsystems with a total capacity of 14 MW.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The project outputs can be grouped in two parts. Part A is improved energy efficiency, to \nbe achieved by replacing aging steam and gas turbine plants at Ashugani power station that \nhave a capacity of 274 MW with a state-of-the-art CCPP that has a capacity of 450 MW, and \nconstructing a 1-kilometer transmission line to connect the new plant to the national grid. Part B \nis increased renewable energy use, to be achieved by (i) installing a 5 MW solar photovoltaic \ngrid-connected power generating plant at Kaptai hydropower plant site; (ii) installing an off-grid \nwind\u2013solar hybrid system with diesel generator on Hatiya Island (1 MW solar photovoltaic, 1 \nMW  wind,  and  5.5 MW  diesel);  and  (iii)  installing  or  retrofitting  streetlights  that  use  solar \nphotovoltaic and LED technology in the six cities. \n \n8.   Infrastructure investments in parts A and B will be supplemented by capacity building for \neach, toward supporting project implementation and training on operation and maintenance \n(O&M) for the staff of executing agencies (EAs) and communities to be served by the off-grid \nwind\u2013solar hybrid plant. This will include training women on the O&M of solar photovoltaic and \nsolar\u2013wind  hybrid  plants  and  a  gender-sensitive  educational  program  for  beneficiaries  on \nhousehold energy efficiency.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n9.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $300  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project.6 The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(with interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2010.

Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The EAs will be Ashuganj Power Station Company (APSC) for part A; Bangladesh \nPower Development Board (BPDB) for part B (i) and (ii); and the Power Division under the \nMinistry  of  Power,  Energy,  and  Mineral  Resources  for  part  B  (iii).  Implementation  will  be \nundertaken and supervised by a project management unit (PMU) within each executing agency. \nThe  PMUs  will  be  headed  by  senior  officials  and  staffed  by  adequate  personnel.  PMU \nresponsibilities  will  include  (i)  overall  project  coordination,  management,  and  monitoring; \n(ii) annual budget preparation and monitoring the utilization of loan proceeds; (iii) progress \nreporting,  including  reports  on  cost  management  and  project  impact;  and  (iv)  ensuring \ncompliance with loan covenants. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 \nand described in detail in the project administration manual.8  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 Jan 2012 - 30 June 2017 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2017 (loan closing on 31 December 2017) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee chaired by the Secretary, Power Division under the \nMinistry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources  \n(ii)  Executing agencies  APSC, BPDB, Power Division \n(iii) Key implementing  Project management units within APSC, BPDB, Power Division \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation units  Ashuganj, 16 staff (APSC); Dhaka, 10 staff (BPDB); Dhaka, 5 staff \n(Power Division) \nProcurement  International competitive  Four contract  $461.99 million  \n  bidding  packages \nConsulting services (project  Financed by the government  Four contract  $6.88million \nimplementation and training )  and ADB   packages \nRetroactive financing and  All eligible contract packages and eligible expenditures agreed between \nadvance contracting  ADB and the government \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between ADB and the government. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  APSC  =  Ashuganj  Power  Station  Company,  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.  Goods and works to be financed under the project will be procured in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) except the turnkey power \nplant package under part A, which will be jointly financed with IDB, with IDB financing the cost of \nthe gas turbine and the heat recovery steam generator. As it is not possible to separately \nprocure individual components of this package, its procurement will be conducted jointly by ADB \nand IDB. In order to enable such joint procurement, it is proposed to expand country eligibility \nfor procurement under part A by allowing firms, subcontractors, and sourcing of materials from \nany country eligible under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and IDB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nof Goods and Works under IDB Financing (2009). Such an expansion of country and source \neligibility is required to implement the jointly financed package and would require a waiver under \nArticle 14 (ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank.  In the absence of \nsuch a waiver, implementation of the package as a jointly co-financed package will not be \n                                                \n8  Project administration manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "    5 \n     \npossible.  All  goods  and  works  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding.  All \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). Consulting firms will be recruited using quality- and cost-based \nselection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n  \n15.  The funds required for the jointly financed package will be directly disbursed to the \nsupplier by IDB. For effective coordination between the cofinanciers and the borrower, ADB will \ndevelop,  in  consultation  with  IDB,  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  lay  out  the  basic \nprinciples and procedures for collaboration, cooperation, and exchanging information at the time \nof implementation. The minutes recording discussions on the contents of such a memorandum \nof understanding were finalized by ADB and IDB during the appraisal mission. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical    \n16.  The draft power sector master plan update 2010 identifies the need to add 11 CCPPs \neach with 450 MW capacity in 2010\u20132016. The proposed Ashuganj 450 MW plant (part A) can \nbe considered one of these CCPPs. Further, the government has identified the proposed plant \nas a priority project in its expansion plan. The economic cost of electricity supply from the \nAshuganj CCPP is similar to or lower than those of a coal-fired power plant (based on the costs \ntaken from the master plan), confirming that the proposed plant is among the least-cost options \nfor generating new capacity. CCPP design will use the latest commercially available technology \nto harness the maximum benefit of energy efficiency. Part B of the project will demonstrate \nrenewable energy technologies and their application for long-term large-scale penetration into \nthe Bangladesh power system. The subcomponents in part B use solar photovoltaic, wind \npower, and LEDs, which are commercially proven technologies. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  Financial analysis of the proposed project was carried out in accordance with ADB's \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.9 All financial costs and benefits are expressed \nin  constant  2010  prices.  The  financial  viability  of  the  Ashuganj  CCPP  was  assessed  by \ncomparing the incremental costs and benefits of the project. The incremental benefits were \ncalculated based on the revenue stream from power sales to BPDB and avoided costs of O&M \nfor aging power plants. The capital investments, O&M costs, and taxes incurred to install and \noperate the project were used as costs. In renewable energy components, the revenue stream \nin the form of power sales or avoided power purchase and a cost stream consisting of capital \ncosts, O&M costs, and taxes were used. The financial internal rate of return for part A is 7.6% \nagainst an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 2.16%, while that for part B is negative \ndue to high capital costs and low power sales and avoided power purchase tariffs. However, \npart B has redeeming demonstration impact on renewable energy development in Bangladesh. \n \n18.  As  Bangladesh  currently  faces a  power  deficit,  cost  savings from  prevented  power \noutages are a direct tangible economic benefit of the project in addition to any resource cost \nsavings achieved through replacement with alternative fuels and efficiency gains. Part A of the \nproject provides an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 70%, derived mainly from a large \nreduction in the use of gas per unit of electricity generated. Part B, consisting of renewable \nenergy, provides only a marginal EIRR of 12% because of high capital costs. However, its \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "6   \ndemonstration impact and avoided costs brought by reduced local pollution and climate change \nmitigation are additional benefits that would significantly enhance the EIRR if quantified and \nincluded. The integrated project provides an EIRR of 63.4%. Sensitivity analyses show project \nreturns  to  be  stable  against  changes  to  critical  variables  and  demonstrate  the  economic \nfeasibility of the project. \n \n19.  The  Clean  Development  Mechanism,  established  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and \nmanaged by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has significant \npotential to provide additional carbon financing to support the development of clean energy \nprojects  that  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  Kyoto  Protocol  signatory  countries.  As \nBangladesh is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, the project can benefit from carbon financing \nunder the Clean Development Mechanism.  \n \n20.  Part A of the project, which replaces aging steam and gas turbine plants with a state-of-\nthe-art CCPP, will avoid 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per annum. Part B, \ninstalling solar photovoltaic, wind power, and LED lighting, will avoid emission of 25,000 tons of \nCO2 per annum. These make the project eligible under the Clean Development Mechanism, \nwhich could improve its financial viability. \n \nC.  Governance \nTable 4: Governance Measures \nArea  Measures \nInstitutional and  APSC and BPDB will independently file tariff petitions with the Bangladesh \ncorporate governance  Energy Regulatory Commission. \nAnticorruption  ADB will review and examine any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to the project.  \nProcurement  (i)  Project management units are to be established, headed by senior officers \nreporting directly to the managing director of APSC and BPDB and the \nadditional secretary to the Power Division in the case of part B (iii). \n(ii)  Bid specifications and packaging are being prepared to ensure maximum \ncompetition under international competitive bidding procedures. \n(iii) Information on procurement will be disclosed on company websites. \n(iv) Procurement capacity support will be made available at the ADB Resident \nMission to expedite action on procurement issues. \nFinancial  (i)   Measurable financial performance indicators for APSC and BPDB have been \nmanagement  established. \nand audit  (ii)  Expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody of project-\nfinanced assets will be monitored by the accounting and control systems of \nAPSC and BPDB. \n(iii) Internal audit reports will be provided to the audit committees of the company \nboards of the respective companies. \n(iv) Financial statements will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to \nADB and regularly published and reported to shareholders. \nGrievance review  A grievance redress mechanism will be established to address issues relating to \nproject implementation. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  APSC  =  Ashuganj  Power  Station  Company,  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "    7 \n     \n21.  The government established its Anticorruption Commission in 2004, and ADB provided \ntechnical assistance to help build capacity and provide support for an integrated anticorruption \nstrategy.10 The government will ensure that APSC and BPDB have operational autonomy and \nthat no organizational changes will affect their ability to perform their obligations under the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government, APSC, BPDB, and the Power Division. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \nTable 4 summarizes major governance measures adopted for the project. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world with nearly half of its \npopulation living below the $1.25 poverty line. Lack of adequate and reliable electricity has \ncontributed to perpetuating poverty. Only 49% of the population has access to electricity. Even \nthose with electricity face power shortages and poor reliability of supply. These factors have \nseverely constrained the growth of industry and the delivery of essential services (including \nhealth care and education) and contributed to environmental pollution and poverty. \n \n23.  From a poverty and sustainability perspective, the project will have positive benefits \nlocally and regionally across the project areas of influence. Benefits will be direct and indirect \nconsequences of increased access to reliable and clean energy supplies, allowing progressive \neconomic  and  social  development.  The  project  will  generate  a  considerable  number  of \ntemporary and permanent jobs. New and  expanded access to reliable power supplies will \nenhance  the  production  capacity  of  industries  and  facilitate  new  commerce,  creating \nopportunities in agriculture, garment manufacture, and complementary businesses. \n \n24.  Improved  power  supplies  will  lighten  women\u2019s  household  drudgery  and  enhance \nwomen\u2019s  energy-related  livelihood  opportunities.  Bangladesh\u2019s  commitment  to  integrating \ngender and social considerations in the energy sector was agreed during a 1-day consultation \nmeeting in November 2010 with the Power Division. The project was identified for integrating \ngender and social enhancement interventions. The inputs from the consultation have guided the \ndesign of the gender action plan, which includes as key design features (i) increasing women\u2019s \nparticipation in energy-related employment and energy-based livelihood opportunities resulting \nfrom the loan; (ii) providing technical training to women to enable them to maximize these \nopportunities; (iii) a gender-sensitive user-education program and module to improve household \nenergy efficiency; and (iv) the provision, in selected project sites, of improved cook stoves to \nimprove household energy efficiency, reduce women\u2019s time burden, and improve women\u2019s \nhealth. A pilot project on enabling poor women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector in \nBangladesh that integrates these gender design features will be implemented on Hatiya Island. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Environment. The  project  is  classified  under environmental  category  A  due  to the \ninstallation of the 450 MW Ashuganj CCPP. The government also classified this component as \ncategory A, and APSC prepared an environmental impact assessment in May 2009 based on \nthe Environmental Conservation Rules of 1997. The environmental impact assessment was \napproved by the Department of Environment on 5 May 2010 and revised to conform with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2003.

The Ashuganj CCPP will be located within the existing Ashuganj power station complex. \nThe project will use natural gas as fuel and meet the cooling water requirements of 6.4 cubic \nmeters cubic meters per second, or 52,000 cubic meters per gigawatt-hour, using water from \nthe Meghna River, which will be released back to the river after 3%\u20135% loss, or 1,500\u20132,600 \ncubic meters per gigawatt-hour. CCPP technology has high thermal efficiency, and a burner will \nbe used that limits the formation of nitrogen oxide. A pond will temporarily hold cooling water \ndischarges, and the discharge channel will have adequate turbulence to dissipate heat before \nits final discharge back into the Meghna River. The plan for abandoning the replaced power \nplant units will be prepared by APSC. ADB will review the plan prior to any decommissioning \nworks. \n \n27.  The  other  subprojects  in  part  B  are  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Initial \nenvironmental examination reports have been prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  Part  B  will  utilize  clean  energy  technologies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions by 25,460 tons per year. The subprojects have been assessed for their risk and \nvulnerability to climate change impacts, and design measures have been integrated to ensure \nthat these risks are minimized. The environmental impact assessment and initial environmental \nexamination reports were publicly disclosed through the ADB website on 25 March 2011. The \nEAs  are  committed  to  implementing  the  environmental  management  plan  and  submitting \nsemiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n28.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory B. Constructing the Ashuganj CCPP will require relocating 134 people11 to alternative, \nvacant, and suitable accommodation inside the Ashuganj industrial compound. Affected people \nhave been consulted on the process and consented to relocation under the terms promised by \nAPSC. Relocation will be fully managed by APSC through a resettlement plan, the provisions of \nwhich shall comply with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n29.  Other resettlement impacts include the acquisition of 3.5 hectares of small landholdings \non Hatiya, and minor and temporary nuisances and disturbances caused during the retrofitting \nand upgrading of streetlights, all of which will be minimized through mitigation. Compensation \nfor any temporary or permanent loss of crops and trees will accord with entitlements indicated in \nresettlement plans. Care will be taken to engage and consult with stakeholders as necessary \nand in a culturally sensitive manner. The EAs will ensure that project information is disclosed \nand  disseminated  to  project  stakeholders  in  a  timely  manner.  If,  during  implementation, \nadjustments  are  made  to  the  project,  these  will  be  reflected  in  the  entitlement  matrix  in \nconsultation with displaced and otherwise affected people.  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified under indigenous peoples category C. No \nindigenous groups  have  been  identified  as  potentially  affected  by the  project.  Additionally, \nwhere worker migration is required, the project will minimize the risk of HIV/AIDS through \ninformation  dissemination  campaigns  at  project  areas  per  the  provisions  in  the  project \nadministration manual.12 \n \n                                                \n11  ASPC workers and family members, of which 42 workers are security guards.  \n12  Section VII (safeguards) and section VIII (gender and social) of the project administration manual (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "    9 \n     \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The  main  risks  to  the  project  are  to  part  A,  which  is  more  than  80%  of  the  total \ninvestment. The main risk to Ashuganj subproject viability is the absence of a long-term power \npurchase agreement (PPA) between APSC and BPDB. A provisional PPA signed between the \ntwo entities in 2005 was last reviewed in September 2009. BPDB will expedite developing long-\nterm PPAs for all the generating companies. \n32.  The other risk to the viability of the Ashuganj subproject is the possibility of reduced gas \nallocation to the Ashuganj power station. Considering that the gas requirement for the new \npower plant is less than that of the power plants to be replaced, the gas allocation risk is \nminimal. Further, Ashuganj power station is located closer to the gas fields, and several gas \npipelines feed the power station. Therefore, the possibility of reduced gas availability for the \npower station is low. However, an assurance to this effect will be included in the loan agreement. \nFurther coordination between ADB and IDB on issues such as the sequencing of procurement, \ncontract awards, and disbursements is critical to the successful implementation of the project, \nparticularly with regard to the envisioned joint procurement in part A. The memorandum of \nunderstanding expected to be signed between ADB and IDB will address this issue.  \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.  \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nBPDB and APSC fail to enter or  BPDB will expedite developing long-term PPAs for all the generating \ndelay entering into long-term  companies. PPAs need to be reviewed by the Bangladesh Energy \nPPAs  Regulatory Commission. \nCoordination between ADB and  Coordination on issues such as the sequencing of procurement, \nIDB on loan disbursements  contract awards, and disbursements will be covered under loan \nagreements and a memorandum of understanding between ADB and \nIDB. \nReduced gas allocation to the  An assurance relating to maintaining the existing gas allocation to the \nAshuganj power station over the  Ashuganj power station is included in loan documentation. \ncoming years  \nLimited capacity of APSC and  The project components will be implemented as engineering, \nBPDB to implement project  procurement, and construction contracts, which will require minimal \ncomponents  intervention from EAs.  \nImplementation consultants will be provided to project management \nunits of the EAs. \nIncrease in prices for raw  Adequate contingency amounts have been provided.

ASSURANCES \n34.  The  government,  APSC,  BPDB,  and  the  Power  Division  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  will  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n35.  The government, APSC, BPDB, and the Power Division have agreed with ADB on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement  and  project \nagreement. The government has also agreed with ADB that effectiveness of the loan and \nproject agreements is conditional upon a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to ADB, under \nwhich the loan proceeds are relent to APSC and BPDB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i)  the loan of $300 million to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Power \nSystem Efficiency Improvement Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the proposal set out in para. 14 of this report allowing contractors, suppliers, and \nsubcontractors, and materials used by them to be procured from nonmember \ncountries of ADB, to be eligible for financing under the Power System Efficiency \nImprovement Project by the requisite affirmative vote of directors representing \nnot less than two-thirds of the total voting power of ADB\u2019s members, pursuant to \nArticle 14(ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n21 July 2011 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators  and Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  with Baselines  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased  Demand-supply gap eliminated by 2016  BPDB annual  Government emphasis on \nprovision of  (2011 baseline: demand supply gap of  report  energy sector \nbetter  30%)    development to continue \naccess to     \nelectricity   Risk \nInadequate gas supplies \nfor electricity generation \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased  Total installed generation capacity  Annual reports  Improved regulatory \nelectricity  increased to 5,909 MW by 2016   of APSC,  environment \ngenerating  (2011 baseline: installed generation  BPDB, and   \ncapacity   capacity of 5,719MW)  Power Division   \n \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \nImproved      Timely availability of \nenergy      counterpart funds from the \nefficiency       government \n       \n  Successful completion of construction of  Annual reports   \n  Ashuganj combined cycle power plant of  of APSC    \n  450MW and associated 1km transmission     \n  line by Dec 2016     \n       \n  Successful installation of 33,000 LED- Annual reports   \n  based street-lighting  by Mar 2016  of Power   \n    Division   \n       \n  Employment for local labor in O&M of  Annual reports   \n  streetlights (target: minimum of 25% of  of Power   \n  employees are women)   Division   \n       \n  A gender-sensitive user education  Annual reports   \n  program implemented for the safe and  of BPDB   \n  efficient use of electricity in household by     \n  Dec 2012 (pilot target group: up to 1,000     \n  women on Hatiya Island)     \n       \n  Reduction in CO  emissions by 300,000  Annual reports   \n2\n  tons annually against the baseline.  of APSC   \n  (baseline: annual emissions of 44 million     \n  tons in 2016 and 65 million tons in 2020-     \n  Power Sector Master Plan 2010)     \n       \nIncreased  Successful installation of Kaptai solar  Annual reports   \nrenewable  power plant of 5MW, installation of off- of BPDB and   \nenergy use  grid wind (1MW)-solar(1MW)-diesel  Power Division   \n  (5.5MW) hybrid power plant at Hatiya     \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nData Sources \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators  and Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  with Baselines  Mechanisms   and Risks  \n  Island and installation of solar     \n  photovoltaic-powered LED street lighting     \n  (33,000 systems) by Dec 2016     \n       \n  Employment of local labor in O&M of  Annual Reports   \n  Kaptai solar power plant and wind power  of BPDB   \n  plant on Hatiya Island (target: minimum of     \n  25% employed are women)     \n       \n  Reduction in CO2 emissions by 25,000  Annual Reports   \n  tons annually against the baseline  of BPDB and   \n  (baseline: annual emissions of 44 million  Power Division   \n  tons in 2016 and 65 million tons in 2020-    \n  JICA Power Sector Master Plan, 2010)     \n       \nCapacity  Implementation consultants successfully  Annual Reports   \ndeveloped in  employed for all the project components  of APSC   \nthe EAs and  by March 2012     \nsurrounding       \ncommunities  Minimum of 25 people trained on O&M of  Annual Reports   \nAshuganj power plant by June 2017  of APSC   \n     \nMinimum of 25 people trained on O&M of  Annual Reports   \nthe grid-connected solar plant (a  of BPDB   \nminimum of 25% women) by June 2013     \n     \nMinimum of 20 people trained on O&M of  Annual Reports  Local community have \nsolar\u2013wind off-grid plant (at least 25% of  of BPDB  adequate human \nthe trainees being women) by June 2013    resources to build local \n    capacity for O&M of off-\n    grid wind\u2013solar power \n    plants \nSuccessful completion of at least one  Annual Reports \ntraining program for the executing agency  of APSC, \non community involvement and  BPDB and \ninformation dissemination among  Power Division \nbeneficiaries by Dec 2012   \n   \nSuccessful implementation of the project  Annual Reports \ngender action plan for technical training  of APSC, \nand energy-related livelihood activities  BPDB and \ntargeting women by Dec 2013  Power Division \n   \n    \n ", "Appendix 1  13 \n \n Activities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.
