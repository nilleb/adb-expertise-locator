Six \nirrigation  subprojects  (one  in  each  province)  with  good  potential \nfor  increased  agricultural  production  were  selected  according  to \nagreed selection criteria: (i) financially and economically viable, (ii) \ncontributing  strongly  to  poverty  reduction,  (iii)  environmentally \nsustainable,  (iv)  compliant  with  principles  of  integrated  water \nresource management, and (v) responsive to natural disaster risk \nreduction initiatives. \n \nIn  these  schemes,  the  Project  will  (i)  improve  irrigation  system \nmanagement  by  reforming  service  providers  and  concomitantly \nbuilding  capacity  of  client  water  users  as  partners  in  scheme \noperation  and  maintenance,  and  (ii)  improve  irrigation  and \ninfrastructure  and  strengthen  natural  disaster  risk \ndrainage \nreduction measures. Physical works will include rehabilitation and \nnew  construction  of  water  conservation,  irrigation,  drainage,  and \nprotective measures.  \n \nContinued,  deep,  and  lasting  poverty  reduction  in  the  central \ncoastal  region  depends  on  improving  returns  from  agriculture,  a \nsector  whose  performance \nis  held  back  by  physical  and \nthe \ninstitutional  constraints.  The  Project \nassumption  that  improved  performance  of  the  region\u2019s  irrigation \nschemes  depends  on  introducing  service-oriented  management \nsystems \nthat  are  cost-efficient,  effective,  autonomous,  and \naccountable.  The  participation  of  water  user  groups  in  the \nplanning, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance \nof subprojects is not only indispensable for sustainable operation, \nbut  also  a  cost-efficient  means  of  helping  service  providers  meet \ntheir goals.  \n \n\nis  premised  on \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nThe  project  impact  will  be  reduced  poverty  in  six  central \nprovinces.  The  project  outcome  will  be  increased  agricultural \nproduction in selected irrigation subprojects.  \n \nThe total project cost,  including  contingencies, taxes, and  duties, \nis  estimated  at  $99.0  million.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated  at  $37.8  million  or  38%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The \nlocal  currency  cost including taxes is $61.2  million or 62% of the \ntotal project cost. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $74.3 \nmillion equivalent from its Special Fund resources to finance 75% \nof  the  project  cost  amounting  to  $99.0  million.  The  Government \nwill finance about $24.7 million or 25% of the project cost.  \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB will provide a loan of various currencies equivalent to $74.3 \nmillion from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term \nof  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n(CPMU) \n\n \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \n \nThe Project will be executed by MARD through its Central Project \nOffice  (CPO)  based  in  Hanoi.  CPO  will  set  up  a  central  project \nmanagement  unit \n(i)  provide  overall  project \nto \nmanagement  and  coordination,  (ii)  liaise  with  the  provincial \npeople's  committee  and  provincial  department  of  agriculture  and \nrural  development  (DARD)  in  each  province  to  improve  irrigation \nmanagement  systems,  (iii)  guide  and  coordinate  DARD  in  each \nprovince  to  improve  irrigation  infrastructure,  (iv)  implement  the \nproject  performance  management  system  (PPMS),  (v)  procure \nconsulting  services,  (vi)  coordinate  with  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  units  (PPMUs)  in  each  province  to  procure  goods \nand  services \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  (vii) \nprepare  forecasts  of  contract  awards  and  disbursements  and \narrange  project  account  audits,  (viii)  prepare  major  reports \ncovering the whole Project by consolidating the reports from each \nprovince, and (viii) prepare the project completion report. \n \nIn each target province, a PPMU will be created under the direct \nadministration of DARD. Each PPMU will be headed by a full-time \nsubproject  manager  with  qualifications  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nPPMU  will  improve  irrigation  management  systems  (output  1), \nimprove  irrigation  infrastructure  (output  2),  procure  goods  and \nservices using local competitive bidding, operationalize the PPMS, \n\nthrough \n\n\fiii \n\nthrough \n\nimplement  resettlement,  environmental  management,  a \nand \ngender action plan, an HIV/AIDS awareness program, and (in Tra \nCau subproject) an ethnic minority development plan.  \n \nThe vice minister of MARD will head a project steering committee \nset up to provide policy and strategy advice and to communicate \nproject outcomes with other ministries. \n \nCivil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost more than $2 million equivalent will be \nprocured \ninternational  competitive  bidding  among \nprequalified firms with proven technical competence acceptable to \nADB. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $2 million or less will \nbe procured through local competitive bidding  procedures. State-\nowned  enterprises  will  be  eligible  to  bid  for  contracts  if  they  are \nfinancially  autonomous,  independently  managed,  and  operate  on \nthe basis of commercial practice. Equipment to be procured under \nthe  Project  includes  vehicles,  motorcycles,  computers,  software, \nand  water  quality  monitoring  equipment.  Such  equipment  will  be \nprocured  by  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is \nmore  than  $1  million,  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is \n$500,000 to $1 million per package, and local competitive bidding \nwhere  the  cost  is  less  than  $500,000.  Where  local  suppliers  are \nfew,  procurement  may  be  made  by  direct  purchase,  with  a \nthreshold  of  $100,000,  as  will  be  the  case  for  negotiated  service \ncontracts with nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \nThe  Project  will  require  227  person-months  of  domestic  and  103 \nperson-months  of \ninternational  consultants.  All  consultants, \nNGOs,  and  local  institutions  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and \nengagement of domestic consultants. The quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  will  be  used.  The  consultants  will  build  the \ncapacity  of  MARD  and  DARD  to  develop  and  operationalize \nirrigation  management  companies  and \nbusiness  plans \nenterprises, create and operationalize PPMS, and coordinate and \nsupervise  project  implementation.  Local  consulting  firms,  NGOs, \nand institutions will be engaged to provide training, implement the \ngender  action  plan  and  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  create \nwater  user  groups  and associations,  complete  the  final  design  of \nworks and supervise their construction, and monitor performance. \nA team of international and domestic consultants, some of whom \nwill be based in Thua Thien Hue, will assist CPMU in MARD and \nthe PPMU in each of the project provinces.  \n \nThe Project will establish a service-oriented approach to irrigation \nwater  management  where  provincial  agencies  and  the  water \nusers  will  be  empowered  to  jointly  manage  irrigation  schemes. \nThis will be done by (i) restructuring the water service providers as \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n\fiv \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nfinancially  autonomous  entities,  and  forming  water  users  into \ngroups  to  participate  fully  in  irrigation  management;  and  (ii) \nconstructing and rehabilitating water management infrastructure in \neach  subproject  area.  Natural  disaster  risk  reduction  measures \nwill complement the physical improvements. The main quantifiable \nbenefits  for  the  subproject  areas  are  incremental  outputs  of \nagricultural products from 57,755 hectares deriving from (i) higher \ncropping  intensities,  (ii)  higher  yields  due  to  reliable  and  full \nirrigation  water  supply,  and  (iii)  incremental  output  from  shrimp \nand fish farming. \n \nAbout 400,500 people in the six subproject areas will benefit from \nincreased  agricultural  income  and  more  jobs.  Many  of  them  will \nbenefit from improved water supply for domestic use and reduced \nvulnerability  to  natural  disasters.  About  38%  of  beneficiary \nhouseholds  live  below  the  poverty  line  of  $0.33  per  person  per \nday. Generally, farm benefits are expected to nearly double, lifting \nabout 6,000 households above the poverty line. About 25% of the \nhouseholds  are  headed  by  women  and  have  limited  access  to \nadult  labor,  land,  and  credit.  A  gender  action  plan  will  be \nimplemented  to  assist  these  households.  Resettlement  plans  will \nensure \nthat  project-affected  people  will  be  adequately \ncompensated  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  The  Project  is \neconomically  viable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \n15% for the base case. \n \nThe  main  risks  arise  from  delays  in  realizing  benefits.  Possible \ncauses  of  delay  are  slowness  in  recruiting  consultants  and \nappointing  central  and  provincial  project  management  staff, \nresistance  of  vested  interests  to  changes  in  organizational \nstructure  of  service  providers,  cumbersome  administrative \nprocesses related to contract awards, and insensitive handling of \nresettlement.  Resettlement  and  compensation  of  people  affected \nby the construction works need to be completed before civil works \ncontracts are awarded.  \n \nThe Project includes measures to mitigate the above risks, and all \nrisks.  The  principal \nenvironmental,  social,  and \nassumption \nthe \nfully  support \nthe  Government  will \nis \ninstitutional  reform  process,  including  the  restructuring  of  service \nproviders and promotion of more autonomous water user groups. \nProject  consultants  will  help  the  provincial  authorities  complete \nresettlement  on  time.  MARD  has  experience  in,  and  a  good \nunderstanding  of  Government  and  ADB \nfor \nresettlement. \n\nrequirements \n\nfinancial \n\nthat \n\n\fv \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Water Resources Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRural Poverty and Agriculture \n\n2. \nViet Nam\u2019s energetic pursuit of development over the last two decades, accompanied by \neconomic liberalization and greater openness to the outside world, has produced a remarkable \ntransformation in what was hitherto a traditional and poor rural society. Strong economic growth \nhas  led  to  increasingly  rapid  urbanization  and  correspondingly  unprecedented  increases  in \nwages and quality of life. Despite the changes this has wrought and the pressures placed on the \ncountry\u2019s decrepit infrastructure, Viet Nam has retained its rich culture and a rural landscape of \nunparalleled  beauty.  The  country\u2019s  agricultural  land,  predominantly  devoted  to  rice  cultivation, \nincludes  the  Red  River  and  Mekong  River  delta  areas  as  well  as  the  narrow  plains  stretching \nalong the 1,500 kilometers (km) of coastline connecting these mighty river deltas. \n \n3. \nThe rural tranquility conceals a deepening crisis. Although Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth \nhas averaged more than 7% over the last 5 years and overall poverty has been reduced from \n58.1%  in  1993  to  24.1%  in  2004,1  poverty  reduction  has  not  been  uniform  and  pockets  of \nextreme  poverty  persist  in  rural  areas.2  Inequalities  in  income  distribution  have  increased, \nreflecting higher growth in per capita income in areas that are rapidly developing, and resource-\nrich than in areas that are remote, lack infrastructure, have few resources, or are vulnerable to \nnatural  disasters.  Rural  areas  have  not  benefited  to  the  same  extent  from  liberalization.  Most \ninstitutions serving rural communities have changed little from an earlier era of central control, \nand  have  not  benefited  from  the  public  administration  reforms  that  have  brought  more \nimmediate benefits to fast-developing urban areas. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  population  of  83  million  is  still  predominantly  rural  (60  million  or  73%)  and \n4. \ndependent  on  agriculture  for  livelihoods  and  basic  needs.3  The  contribution  from  agriculture, \nforestry,  and  aquaculture  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  20.5%  in  2005  and, \nalthough the sector\u2019s contribution is expected to decline to 15.5% by 2010, the sector led in job \ncreation\u2014adding  4.6  million  out  of  7.5  million  new  jobs\u2014during  2001\u20132005.  Over  the  next  5 \nyears,  agriculture  is  expected  to  grow  by  about  3%  (compared  with  10%  for  industry  and \nconstruction,  and  8%  for  services).  By  2010,  the  number  of  people  engaged  in  agriculture  is \nexpected to decline to 44 million or 50% of the total population. \n \n5. \nViet Nam\u2019s investments in agriculture, equivalent to about 5% of the national budget, are \nspent  mostly  on  irrigation  and  forestry.4  For  irrigation,  the  upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure \ndominates the Government's program (64% of spending in 2003). Nevertheless, about 40% (or \n2.25 million hectares [ha]) of the commanded areas are not yet served.

Hanoi, \n\nDecember 2004. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nupgrade and expand the country's water sector infrastructure is estimated to be more than $3 \nbillion, as confirmed at the December 2004 consultative group meeting, where water supply and \nirrigation were identified as priority sectors for official development assistance. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Critical Role of Water \n\n6. \nViet Nam is exposed to typhoons that cause flash floods, landslides, and coastal erosion \nalong its eastern seaboard. Its monsoon climate guarantees abundant water at some times of \nthe  year,  leading  to  flooding  of  much  of  its  most  productive  agricultural  land,  but  also  water \nshortages  during  the  dry  season.  Rivers  that  originate  within  Viet  Nam  are  short  and  steep, \noffering  limited  opportunities  for  multipurpose  water  storage  reservoirs,  and  about  60%  of  its \nwater resources originate from neighboring countries. The high regional, seasonal, and annual \nvariability  of  water  supply  is  likely  to  become  more  so  because  of  climate  change  associated \nwith  global  warming.  The  impacts  of  human  activities  on  some  river  basin  upper  catchments \naggravate the perceptibly increased flooding and sediment discharge during the wet season and \ndiminished low flows during the dry season. Salt water intrusion is advancing into coastal plains \nand  delta  areas,  limiting  opportunities  for  extraction  of  water  for  agricultural,  domestic,  and \nindustrial  uses.  This  is  exacerbated  by  increased  upstream  withdrawals  to  meet  the  growing \nneeds  of  an  industrializing  and  urbanizing  economy.  Pollution  of  surface  and  ground  water  is \nemerging as a problem in many river basins. \n \n7. \nViet  Nam  has  a  long  history  of  water  management  in  support  of  agricultural \nintensification  and  the  development  of  a  strong  industrial  sector.5  Its  transformation  into  a \nmarket-oriented  economy  has  brought  decentralization,  socialization,  grassroots  democracy, \nand the promotion of small-scale private enterprise to the fore of its water sector reform agenda, \ncreating a favorable environment for institutional change at all levels of water management.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIrrigation Performance in the Central Coastal Region \n\n8. \nThe  central  region  has  particularly  severe  constraints  that  single  it  out  for  special \nsupport.6  The  Government's  5-year  socioeconomic  development  plan  (SEDP)  for  2006\u20132010 \n(footnote 1) notes the  region\u2019s persistent poverty which declined to an  average of  38% during \n1992\u20132004  from  74.5%  in  the  north  and  47.2%  in  the  south  central  coastal  regions.7  The \ncoastal  plain,  which  encompasses  the  region\u2019s  irrigation  schemes,  experiences  4\u20136  typhoons \neach year on average.8 Completion or rehabilitation of these schemes (covering not only major \nstructures  for  diversion  and  conveyance  of  water,  but  also  lower  level  canals  and  drains  and \nmeasures to protect against floods), is a prerequisite to full performance. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   Irrigation, drainage, and flood control have traditionally been the main foci of  water sector development with less \n\nthan 1% of total water resources used to meet municipal and industrial demands. \n\n6 ADB's country strategy and program (CSP) (ADB. Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132004); Viet Nam. Manila) \nallocated one-third of lending to the central region as a major thrust of ADB's assistance program. This emphasis \nhas been retained in various updates through to the most recent CSP update (ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and \nProgram  Update  (2006-2008)  Viet  Nam.  Manila).  The  CSP  update  states  that  the  region  is  constrained  by  its \npaucity of resources, and low capacity to develop strategic plans and mobilize resources.  \n\n7  The  SEDP  aims  to  achieve  annual  average  GDP  rates  of  8.0\u20139.0%  for  these  regions  during  2006\u20132010,  with \n\nagriculture contributing 3.1%. \n\n8  The  frequency  and  severity  of  natural  disasters  along  the  central  coast  led  to  the  establishment  of  the  Natural \n\nDisaster Mitigation Partnership between the Government and international funding agencies.  \n\n\f  3\n\nThe  major  constraints,  however,  relate  to  management  (Appendix  1).  The  Ministry  of \n9. \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and other national agencies involved in managing \nand  using  water  follow  an  engineering,  sectoral  approach  to  water  resource  development  and \nhave yet to fully assimilate integrated water resources management (IWRM) into their planning \nstrategies  and  work  practices.  Provincial  agencies  have  considerable  authority  to  make  key \ndecisions  on  water  infrastructure  development  and  management,  subject  to  conformity  with \nnational sector policies and strategies, but their capacity to target poverty in water projects and \ncoordinate  various  cross-sectoral  aspects  of  resource  management  is  limited.  Irrigation \nmanagement  companies  (IMCs)\u2014state-owned  public  utility  enterprises  responsible  for  the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of large irrigation schemes\u2014display little service orientation \nor capacity to manage irrigation in a sustainable manner. Maintenance is frequently neglected in \nfavor of Government-financed periodic rehabilitation. At the tertiary level, water users have yet \nto be fully empowered to take water management decisions affecting their livelihoods. Critically, \nthere is a disconnect between the payment of water user fees and the delivery of water in the \ncorrect  amounts  and  at  the  appropriate  time.  The  institutional  context  and  issues  affecting \nirrigation performance are described in Appendix 1. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment's Strategy \n\n10. \nThe  SEDP  defines  development  objectives  for  the  coming  5  years.  It  incorporates  the \nfundamentals  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy9  and  the \npoverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  with  ADB.  To  achieve  the  SEDP\u2019s  aim  of  eliminating \nextreme poverty in rural areas, the Government will focus on poor regions and make better use \nof their development potential. In relation to agriculture, SEDP sets out several approaches to \nincrease returns:  \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\ncomplete, rehabilitate, and modernize water infrastructure to ensure optimum use \nand conservation of water resources for irrigation, water supply, and industry; \nbuild the capacity of Government agencies at all levels to incorporate grassroots \ndemocracy in managing resources and delivering services; \nincrease the role of users in O&M of irrigation systems; \ndevelop better natural disaster forecasting and warning capability; \nbecome  more  responsive  to  the  requirements  of  international  markets  and \nincrease  export  competitiveness  by  diversifying  and  giving  more  attention  to \nquality; \ncreate  greater  opportunity  for  private  sector  development  and  intensify  linkages \nbetween industry and agriculture; \nprovide credit and more innovative loans for the poor; and \ngive  priority  in  social  support  programs  to  ethnic  minorities  and  others  whose \npoverty is more deeply entrenched, including poor women and children. \n\n \n11. \nIn  2004,  MARD  launched  a  national  program  to  rehabilitate  irrigation  schemes  and \nestablish  a  service-oriented  approach  where  provincial  agencies  and  the  water  users  will  be \nempowered to jointly manage irrigation schemes. In this way MARD aims to raise the efficiency \nof  water  delivery,  realize  the  full  potential  of  its  investments,  and  reduce  subsidies  for  O&M. \nRegulations  enabling  provinces  to  modify  the  structure  and  roles  of  their  departments  of \n                                                 \n9   The strategy focuses on three goals: (i) increased income in the rural sector through broad-based, sustainable and \nhigh quality growth; (ii) reduced income disparities, risks and vulnerability, and improved food security and social \nwell-being  of  the  poor;  and  (iii)  improved  sustainability  of  natural  resources  in  rural  areas.  The  poverty  reduction \npartnership agreement, signed by the Government and ADB in 2002, covers a subset of the objectives set out in \nthe strategy. \n\n\f4 \n\nagriculture and rural development (DARDs) and to make concomitant changes in the IMCs will \nbe set in place by the beginning of 2006. This will enable and encourage the IMCs to develop \nbusiness  plans  based  on  needs  rather  than  Government  fiat,  and  to  set  user  fees  at  realistic \nlevels subject to guaranteed service delivery. MARD has concurrently established a program to \naccelerate  implementation  of  participatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  with  the  objective  of \ntransferring responsibility for O&M to farmers. This is being piloted under the Second Red River \nBasin Sector Project.10  \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB has supported water resource projects in Viet Nam from the early 1990s.11 Project \n12. \ncompletion reports prepared for two\u2014the Irrigation and Flood Protection Rehabilitation Project12 \nand the Red River Delta Water Resources Sector Project13\u2014highlight the limited gains that can \nbe achieved by physically improving irrigation schemes if commensurate attention is not given \nto  the  social,  institutional,  and  regulatory  frameworks  within  which  they  function.  MARD,  until \nrecently,  has  shown  little  interest  in  participatory  processes  for  planning,  design,  and  O&M  of \ncompleted  schemes.  Its  contracting  experience  before  1993  was  exclusively  with  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) for which fixed-cost norms (largely unrelated to market value) sidestepped \ntrue  competition  and  worked  against  quality  construction.  MARD\u2019s  inexperience  with  ADB's \nsafeguard policies and guidelines for procurement and selection of consultants led to inordinate \ndelays  that  were  exacerbated  by  the  Government's  own  complex  and  time-consuming  review \nand approval procedures.  \n \n13. \nSpecific  lessons  related  to  project  design  are:  (i)  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nshortcomings\u2014particularly  the  low  capacity  of  institutions  at  provincial  and  lower  levels  of \ngovernment\u2014need to be fully recognized and addressed in the design phase; (ii) the capacity of \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  to  incorporate  social,  environmental,  and  governance \naspects needs to be complemented by sustained technical assistance (TA); (iii) the number of \nsubprojects  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum  and  they  should  be  straightforward  and  simple  to \nimplement;14  (iv)  irrigation  water  users  should  be  engaged  early  in  planning  and  design  to \nensure  that  their  needs  are  adequately  reflected  and  to  include,  under  project  financing,  the \nsmall-scale  works  needed  to  ensure  equitable  distribution  of  water  at  field  level;  (v)  specific \nactions targeting women and female-headed households ensure more equitable distribution  of \nbenefits in rural development projects;15 (vi) a whole river basin approach to the management of \nwater resources should be taken in areas with potential water scarcity; and (vii) greater attention \nneeds to be given to monitoring project performance, including establishing baseline conditions \nprior to project implementation. \n \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  2001.

Hanoi. \n\n\f  5\n\nAnalyses of ADB's projects in the sector have consistently shown that a broad, systems \n14. \napproach  is  needed  to  identify  constraints  and  the  means  of  overcoming  them.  Such  an \napproach  draws  development  planners,  implementers,  operators,  and  users  into  a  partnership \nfor  improved  project  design  and  scheme  management.  In  disaster  prone  areas,  improved \nperformance also depends on putting into place effective risk reduction measures. Achieving full \npotential  therefore  requires  practical  and  holistic  interventions  to  (i)  build  capacity  of  key \nstakeholder agencies at various levels, including introducing community-based, demand-driven \napproaches such as PIM; (ii) eliminate physical impediments to efficient scheme operation; and \n(iii) provide appropriate levels of support for project management. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB's Strategy for Water Sector Operations \n\n15.  When  ADB  resumed  lending  to  Viet  Nam  in  1993,  the  country  was  the  world\u2019s  third \nlargest  rice  exporter.  Nevertheless,  the  nation\u2019s  water  resources  infrastructure,  on  which  rice \nproduction and the welfare of a large segment of society depended, had deteriorated to a poor \ncondition.  ADB  supported  the  rehabilitation  of  large,  functioning  irrigation  schemes  to  assure \ntheir  continued  operation,  obtain  rapid  improvements  in  agricultural  production  and  economic \ngrowth, and raise living conditions and quality of life.  \n \n16.  More  recently,  ADB's  emphasis  in  rural  development  has  shifted  to  balancing \ninfrastructure investments with  livelihood support and capacity building, reflecting the adoption \nin  1999  of  poverty  reduction  as  ADB's  overarching  goal16  and  the  more  general  shift  by  the \nglobal development community in 2000 to the Millennium Development Goals as the benchmark \nfor monitoring poverty reduction. In response, the CSP 2002\u20132004 allocated one third of lending \nto  the  impoverished  central  region.  With  the  new  emphasis  on  livelihood  support  and  poverty \ntargeting, project preparation became more participatory, but technical content became diluted \nand projects more complicated.17  \n \nADB,  in  close  partnership  with  other  lending  and  funding  agencies,  seeks  to  maximize \n17. \nthe economic growth and poverty reduction potential of water sector infrastructure investments \nby targeting poor regions, and incorporating institutional support and policy reforms in line with \nthe  water  policy.18  Hence,  greater  emphasis  is  now  being  given  to  improving  water  service \ndelivery, increasing the autonomy and accountability of service providers to meet the needs of \nthe  poor,  and  establishing  sustainable  O&M  through  appropriate  levels  of  cost  recovery  and \nuser  participation.  ADB  is  providing  long-term  capacity  building  for  national,  river  basin,  and \nprovincial IWRM to support its investment program.19 Concurrently, the Second Red River Basin \nSector  Project  is  establishing  IWRM  in  the  Red  River  basin  and  building  relevant  institutional \ncapacity  in  MARD  and  the  provincial  agencies.  In  accordance  with  ADB's  disaster  and \nemergency assistance policy,20 all new projects incorporate disaster risk reduction measures to \nprepare for and avoid the worst impacts of natural disasters.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16 The three pillars of the poverty reduction strategy are pro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, \n\nand good governance. \n\n17 ADB. 2004.

At  the  Government\u2019s  request  in  1998,  ADB  led  the  coordination  of  international  assistance \nfor  capacity  building  and  implementation  of  water  sector  reforms  under  the  Law  on  Water \nResources.  Funding  agency  coordination  in  the  water  sector  has  been  particularly  effective: \nADB, Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the World Bank together support the work of the \nNational  Water  Resource  Council  (NWRC)  through  complementary  tasks,  with  ADB  taking  a \nleading role, and it is already the practice for two or more funding agencies to jointly implement \na particular program or project in parallel or as co-financiers.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n19. \nThere  is  compelling  evidence  that  rejuvenation  of  rural  economies  through  accelerated \nagricultural  and  rural  development  is  essential  to  an  inclusive  growth  strategy,  not  just  to \nincrease  agricultural  production  and  rural  incomes  but  also  to  buttress  nonfarm  and  urban  job \ncreation and to reduce migration of underemployed rural workers to urban centers.21 Continued, \ndeep, and lasting poverty reduction in the central coastal region depends on improving returns \nfrom  agriculture,  a  sector  whose  performance  is  held  back  by  physical  and  institutional \nconstraints. Transforming irrigated agriculture requires interventions to improve the performance \nof  subnational  agencies,  delegate  greater  responsibility  to  them  for  investment  decisions,  and \nintroduce community-based, demand-driven approaches including PIM. \n \nThe  Project,  prepared  under  TA  4001-VIE,22  assumes  that  the  region\u2019s  irrigation \n20. \nschemes can best be improved by introducing service-oriented management systems that are \n(i) financially sound (cost-efficient); (ii) capable of meeting agreed service targets (effective); (iii) \nenabled  and  structured  to  prepare  work  plans,  budgets,  user  fees,  and  staff  plans \n(autonomous);  and  (iv)  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  client  base  (accountable).  To  realize \nproject objectives in a socially just manner, agencies involved in water resources management \nneed  to  be  attuned  to  the  special  needs  of  disadvantaged  segments  of  the  communities  to \nensure  that  the  benefits  of  irrigation  do  not  accrue  only  to  the  wealthier  households,  and  that \nethnic  minorities  and  female-headed  households  can  equitably  benefit  from  the  Project.  The \nProject recognizes that the participation of water user groups (WUGs) in the planning, design, \nimplementation, and O&M of subprojects is not only indispensable for sustainable operation, but \nis also a cost-efficient means of helping service providers meet their goals. Finally, the Project \nwill ensure that the basic irrigation infrastructure functions correctly in accordance with modern \ntechnical  standards.  The  Project  reflects  the  poverty  reduction  targets  in  the  SEDP  and  the \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  and  responds  to  the  Government\u2019s \npolicy  to  improve  irrigation  by  making  water  service  delivery  more  decentralized  and \nparticipatory. The concepts have been tested in pilot projects, and project design draws heavily \non the recommendations23 for multi-stakeholder participation.24 \n \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB.  2004.

Subprojects \nwere  selected  and  feasibility  studies  conducted  during  project  processing  with  the  close \nparticipation  of  stakeholders,  including  water  user  representatives.  Subprojects  and  their \ncomponent works satisfy the following agreed criteria: (i) financially and economically viable, (ii) \ncontributing  strongly  to  poverty  reduction,  (iii)  environmentally  sustainable,  (iv)  compliant  with \nprinciples  of  IWRM,  and  (v)  responsive  to  natural  disaster  risk  reduction  initiatives.  Their \ndetailed  design  and  construction  will  be  implemented  according  to  standards  and  procedures \ndeveloped  jointly  with  the  provinces  during  project  preparation.  The  Project  has  two \ncomponents: \n \n\n1. \n\nIrrigation Management Systems Improved \n\na. \n\nEstablish Financially Viable Service Providers \n\nThe Project will help DARD prepare business plans for the autonomous operation of the \n24. \nirrigation service providers (IMCs) covering each subproject. Various options will be considered \nfor  restructuring  the  unprofitable  providers  in  line  with  the  Government's  SOE  reform  agenda \n(including conversion to public utilities or joint-stock companies, or transferring full ownership of \nassets  to  WUGs).  Differences  among  the  provinces  will  be  accommodated.28  The  Project  will \nrestructure the IMCs in each project province subject to satisfactory business plans approved by \nthe PPC and ADB (para. 33). \n \nEach  IMC  will  develop  its  own  business  plan,  assisted  as  necessary  by  project \n25. \nconsultants, in close consultation with other relevant stakeholder agencies: MARD, DARD, the \nPPC,  the  department  of  natural  resources  and  environment  (DoNRE),  the  department  of \n                                                 \n25 Binh Dinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thanh Hoa, and Thua Thien Hue provinces. \n26 These are the Tay Nam Huong Tra, La Tinh, My Trung, Thach Han, Thach Thanh, and Tra Cau schemes which \n\ntotal about 57,755 ha. \n\n27 IMCs may encompass several irrigation management enterprises each serving one or more irrigation schemes. \n28 The provinces have different organizational arrangements for IMCs and irrigation management enterprises (IMEs) \naccording to their needs. In Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, and Thua Thien Hue, provincial or river basin IMCs manage \nirrigation. In 2003, Thanh Hoa established three river basin IMCs following the downgrading of individual scheme \nIMCs to IMEs. In Binh Dinh, one provincial IMC incorporates five IMEs. In Quang Tri, the three river basin IMCs are \nsoon to be downgraded to IMEs managed by a new provincial umbrella IMC. \n\n\f8 \n\nplanning and investment (DPI), agricultural cooperatives, and water users. The business plans \nwill  set  out  a  time-bound  program  for  achieving  financial  sustainability  through  structural  and \nother  changes  to  the  organization  and  staffing,  and  will  describe  key  functions,  service \nrequirements,  equipment  and  skills,  budgets,  information  flows,  accounting  procedures, \nperformance  monitoring,  and  financing  plans.  The  plans  will  include  support  for  the  formation \nand  strengthening  of  WUGs  and  water  user  associations  (WUAs)\u2014umbrella  associations  of \nWUGs\u2014that can be contracted for O&M previously done by IMCs. Agreed annual targets and \nmilestones will form part of the business plan and their achievement will trigger the release of \nproject funds for further change and support.29 Transforming IMCs into financially autonomous, \nefficient  organizations  will,  of  necessity,  be  gradual.30  State  subsidies  will  be  decreased \nincrementally as management systems improve.  \n \nAs  a  precondition  for  successful  PIM  (paras.  27\u201329),  the  awareness,  skills,  and \n26. \nknowledge  of  staff  in  the  PPC,  DARD,  DoNRE,  DPI,  and  IMCs  need  to  be  improved.  The \nProject will train relevant staff members in (i) understanding and supporting institutional reform \nfor improved irrigation management; (ii) skill development for irrigation scheme O&M; (iii) social \nimpact assessments; and (iv) managing irrigation to achieve greater poverty reduction, gender \nequality, and community participation. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen Water User Participation \n\n27.  Working through MARD\u2019s department of water resources (DWR),31 the Project will help \nestablish WUGs on the basis of hydraulic boundaries, replacing (in most cases) the user groups \nthat  are  linked  to  cooperatives  and  based  on  administrative  boundaries.  Inevitably,  this  will \nremove part of the cooperatives\u2019 revenue-generating responsibilities for O&M and will therefore \nmeet  with  some  resistance.  Hence,  the  development  of  a  set  of  agreed  principles  that  are \nendorsed  by  MARD,  DARD,  and  the  PPCs  will  be  a  prerequisite.  National,  provincial,  and \ndistrict  workshops  will  raise  awareness  of  PIM,32  develop  province-specific  guidelines  and \nregulations  (conforming  with  MARD\u2019s  directives),  and  gain  consensus  among  stakeholders  for \nthe new WUGs. \n \n28. \nThe Project will engage a suitable local institution in each province (university, research \ninstitute, consulting firm, or nongovernment organization [NGO]) to help set up WUGs. The main \nsteps  in  the  process  will  be  participatory  assessment  of  the  needs  and  capabilities  of  existing \nWUGs;  sensitization  of  farmers  and  local  leaders  to  the  implications  of  WUG  (and  IMC) \nrestructuring;  development  of  guidelines  for  WUG  operations  and  management,  including \nincreasing  participation  by  female  farmers;  reaching  agreement  with  IMCs  on  the  mandates, \nstructure,  and  membership  of  the  WUGs;  and  training  of  WUG  leaders  in  their  new \nresponsibilities. For large irrigation schemes, WUAs will be set up to represent WUGs. \n \nThe  fledgling  WUGs/WUAs  will  be  assisted  to  prepare  applications  for  the  granting  of \n29. \nlegal status. The aim will be to register them as organizations that can raise funds, open bank \naccounts, and enter into contracts for construction and O&M of the facilities within their service \nareas  (para.  42).  Release  of  project  funds  to  help  the  WUGs/WUAs  become  appropriately \n\n                                                 \n29  Project  financing  will  cover  such  items  as  upgrading  buildings  and  fixed  assets,  purchasing  vehicles  and \n\nequipment, and setting up new management systems. \n\n30 The shedding of staff will be particularly difficult in some cases. \n31  DWR  has  been  designated  to  coordinate  the  PIM  program  and  to  liaise  with  national,  provincial,  and  lower \n\nauthorities to incorporate PIM in all new irrigation investment projects. \n\n32  Strong  support  for  PIM  was  expressed  in  the  regional  MARD/ADB  workshop  on  provincial  pilot  programs  for \n\nimproving public irrigation services held in Hue on 12 May 2005. \n\n\f  9\n\nconstituted  organizations  will  be  subject  to  approval  of  the  applications  for  legal  status  by  the \nrelevant  authority.  In  general,  capital-intensive  maintenance  and  the  operation  of  large \ninfrastructure  will  remain  the  responsibility  of  IMCs,33  with  WUGs/WUAs  contracted  to  provide \nmainly  unskilled  labor.  Hence,  where  ownership  of  secondary  and  higher  canals  is  to  be \ntransferred to WUGs/WUAs, the IMC will remain responsible for complicated or large O&M. \n \n\nc. \n\nDevelop On-Farm Infrastructure \n\nIn  newly  constructed  irrigation  schemes,  the  key  to  achieving  the  expected  agricultural \n30. \nbenefits is timely development of the on-farm works needed for irrigated agriculture. The Project \nwill  support  a  participatory  process,  starting  with  design  of  tertiary  canal  layouts  based  on  the \nselected cropping patterns and topographical constraints, for which farmers\u2019 knowledge of local \nconditions  is  essential.  Farmers  will  provide  labor  under  contract  to  build  the  tertiary  units, \nmainly earthworks, boosting their incomes during the development (fallow) period (para. 42).34  \n \n\nd. \n\nOperationalize Project Performance Management System \n\n31. \nThe  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS),  based  on  management \ninformation software linked to a geographic information system (GIS), will be designed and put \ninto  operation  in  close  consultation  with  the  Central  Project  Office  (CPO)  and  DARD.  Initial \nconditions  determined  through  baseline  surveys  in  each  subproject  will  be  updated  every  6 \nmonths by DARD, the IMCs, and the WUGs/WUAs. CPO and DARD will be trained in managing \nand updating the PPMS at central and provincial or scheme levels. \n \n\ne. \n\nImplement Gender Action Plan and HIV/AIDS Awareness Program \n\n32. \nAlthough female-headed households comprise  up to 48% of households in  some parts \nof  the  project  area,  female  farmers  encounter  many  impediments  to  their  participation  in \neconomic  activities  and  leadership  roles.  Nevertheless,  women  assume  a  disproportionately \nhigh  share  of  the  burden  of  farm  labor  and  are  poorer  than  men.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP) \nhas been prepared for each subproject to ensure more equitable distribution of benefits and to \nimprove  the  participation  of  female  farmers  in  system  O&M.  The  GAP  will  be  underpinned  by \ngender sensitization programs for staff of DARD and the IMCs. To magnify the impact of gender \nawareness  and  to  reach  the  widest  possible  female  target  for  leadership  training,  agricultural \nextension  services,  and  building  business  management  skills,  the  Project  will  train  staff  of  the \nVietnam  Women\u2019s  Union (VWU) as trainers. The  Project  will thereafter  support training  led by \ntrained VWU staff. The Project will also support HIV/AIDS-related awareness raising to counter \nthe risk of HIV/AIDS among male and female migrant workers and to reduce risks of infection \namong  local  populations  through  in-migration  of  construction  workers.  The  program  will  target \nhigh-risk population groups, including contractors, construction workers, and migrants. \n \n\n2. \n\nIrrigation Infrastructure Improved \n\na. \n\nComplete Detailed Design of Subprojects \n\n33. \nThe Project will finance rehabilitation and construction of irrigation and drainage works, \nincluding  natural  disaster  risk  reduction  measures,  in  six  subprojects,  for  which  feasibility \n                                                 \n33 User groups  do not generally have the technical skills needed to operate or assure  quality maintenance of large \n\ninfrastructure, and they do not have the financial means to undertake such work on their own. \n\n34 There  will be  many  unpaid contributions by farmers to  on-farm development, most of  which cannot be estimated \n\nand have not been included as project costs.  \n\n\f10 \n\nstudies  have  been  completed.  Detailed  design  and  preparation  of  contract  documentation  for \nthese  will  be  done  using  local  consulting  firms  selected  by  the  provincial  project  management \nunits (PPMUs) in each province (or CPMU for major works).35 Award of civil works contracts for \nany subproject will follow (i) approval of the relevant IMC\u2019s business plan by the PPC and ADB; \n(ii) completion of resettlement and compensation for the subproject according to its resettlement \nplan;  and  (iii)  approval  by  MARD,  DARD,  and  ADB  of  its  design,  cost  estimate,  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \nProject-financed  consultants  will  help  DARD  update  the  (i)  initial  environmental \n34. \nexamination  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  (ii)  resettlement  plan36 \n(Appendix  4),  (iii)  GAP  (Supplementary  Appendix  A),  (iv)  ethnic  minority  development  plan \n(EMDP)37  (Appendix  5),  and  (v)  on-farm  development  plan,  and  implement  them.  The \nparticipatory  processes  that  were  developed  and  applied  during  project  preparation  will  be \nreinforced during project implementation. Brief summaries of the civil works in each subproject \nare given below.  \n \nThach  Thanh  Subproject  (Thanh  Hoa  Province).  The  subproject  comprises  the \n35. \nfollowing works to improve water delivery for irrigated rice and sugarcane: (i) rehabilitation of 3 \nexisting and construction of 10 new pumping stations lifting water from the Buoi River to serve \n2,280  ha;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  eight  small  storage  reservoirs  and  construction  of  one  new \nreservoir  to  serve  1,291  ha;  (iii)  construction  of  about  90  km  of  earth  canals  to  replace \ndeteriorated concrete flumes; and (iv) rehabilitation of Bai Muong weir. \n \n36. \nThuong  My  Trung  Subproject  (Quang  Binh  Province).  The  main  works  to  be \nimplemented are (i) 82 km of embankment, (ii) rehabilitation of 66 existing and construction of \n23  new  sluice  gates,  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  25  existing  and  construction  of  15  new  pumping \nstations,  and  (iv)  related  bridges  and  aqueducts.  The  subproject  will  improve  irrigation, \ndrainage, and flood protection around Hac Hai lagoon to enable two rice crops on 870 ha above \nmean  sea  level  and  3,318  ha  below  sea  level.  Rice  cropping  will  be  supplemented  by \naquaculture.  \n \n37. \nThach Han Subproject (Quang Tri Province). The scheme, designed in the 1970s to \nirrigate 17,000 ha, was never completed because of water shortages. Its completion can now be \nrealized because the Rao Quan reservoir, now under construction by \u00c9lecticit\u00e9 de Vietnam, will \nincrease water availability and render the subproject feasible. The completed scheme will allow \nfull production on 13,867 ha. The works comprise (i) upgrading the Thach Han headworks38 and \ncanal system (including lining 13 km of main canal and 45 km of primary and lower canals) and \n(ii) construction of Ben Da weir to serve 350 ha. \n \n38. \nTay  Nam  Huong  Tra  Subproject  (Thua  Thien  Hue  Province).  The  scheme  is  badly \ndeteriorated and suffers from poor drainage in some parts, exacerbated by brackish water in the \n                                                 \n35  Any  subprojects  or  discrete  components  of  subprojects  that  are  found  at  the  detailed  design  stage  to  have  low \n\neconomic returns or unacceptable environmental or social impacts will be dropped from the Project. \n\n36  During  detailed  design,  every  effort  will  be  made  to  reduce  the  need  for  relocation  of  households.  The  updated \n\nresettlement plans will be submitted to ADB for approval and will be disclosed to project-affected people.  \n\n37 An EMDP will be implemented in the Tra Cau subproject to accommodate specific needs of the Hre ethnic group. \nDetailed design of the subprojects will include screening to identify any significant ethnic minority impacts that were \nnot discerned during the project preparatory studies. If the screening shows that ethnic minority groups would be at \na disadvantage in the development process or would encounter constraints on their ability to enjoy project benefits, \nthen an EMDP will be prepared in accordance with the framework in Appendix 5. Particular attention will be given \nto the Thach Thanh scheme in Than Hoa Province (para. 68). \n\n38 Headworks means the structure or group of structures controlling the quantity of water entering a major canal. \n\n\f  11\n\nHuong River, its main source of supply. The Thao Long barrier at the mouth of the Huong River, \ndesigned  to  prevent  saline  intrusion,  is  under  construction  and  will  be  completed  within  2005. \nThe works  comprise (i) enlarging the Khe Ngang reservoir, serving 50 ha; (ii) constructing 8.6 \nkm  of  new  main  canal;  (iii)  raising  the  spillway  of  the  Tho  Son  reservoir,  serving  260  ha;  (iv) \nupgrading  the  3-,  5-  and  7-community  canals;  and  (v)  constructing  a  pumping  station  and \nassociated culverts and sluices at Nam Thanh to improve drainage on 300 ha. \n \n39. \nTra Cau Subproject (Quang Ngai Province). The subproject comprises the Liet Son-\nChop Vung, Nui Ngang, and Dien Truong irrigation schemes, in the southern part of the Tra Cau \nriver basin. These were never completed and have deteriorated since construction in the 1980s. \nThe works comprise (i) construction of the Chop Vung reservoir to serve 700 ha; (ii) heightening \nthe  dam  and  spillway  of  the  Dien  Truong  reservoir  and  rehabilitating  and  extending  the  canal \nsystem, including construction of an access road to the dam; and (iii) completion of primary and \nlower level canals in the Nui Ngang system.  \n \n40. \nLa Tinh Subproject (Binh Dinh Province). Because of its deterioration, much of which \nresulted  from  flood  damage,  only  about  1,800  ha  of  a  total  command  area  of  3,950  ha  are \ncurrently irrigated. The works comprise (i) reconstruction of the Cay Ke weir to serve 1,000 ha, \n(ii) lining 80 km of irrigation canal and rehabilitation of canal structures, (iii) rehabilitation of 21.5 \nkm of flood protection embankments between Phu Ly bridge and Cay Ke weir and between La \nTinh and the Can River, and (iii) rehabilitation of three flood diversion/retention spillways \n \n\nb. \n\nImplement Subprojects \n\n41.  MARD  and  DARD  will  supervise  and  manage  the  six  subprojects.  MARD  has \nconsiderable  experience  using  competitively  selected  contractors,  much  of  it  in  implementing \nADB- and World Bank-financed projects. The works are simple and will mostly be constructed, \nin about 43 contract packages, using local  contractors. Project-financed consultants will assist \nwith  tendering  and  construction  supervision.  Particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  construction \nquality, which has often  been deficient. Effective monitoring  and evaluation procedures will be \nincluded, consistent with the PPMS. \n \nSubject  to  the  successful  restructuring  of  the  existing,  cooperative-linked  WUGs  and \n42. \ntheir  conversion  into  legally  and  economically  constituted  WUGs  and  WUAs,  construction  of \nlower canals and simple structures will be implemented by WUGs/WUAs. This will generally be \nmore cost-efficient and effective than constructing such minor works using outside contractors. \nIt will also provide valuable experience for subsequent O&M and inject much-needed cash into \nthe local economy.  \n \n\nc. \n\nResettle and Compensate Affected Persons \n\n43. \nIn  close  consultation  with  the  provincial  agencies,  the  project  preparatory  consultants \nprepared  resettlement  plans  for  the  six  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of \nADB's  resettlement  policy39  and  guidelines.  These  align  closely  with  the  Government\u2019s  new \nresettlement policies and principles (adopted in December 2004). A census and inventory of lost \nassets were carried out for all households potentially affected by loss of land and structures for \nthe irrigation canals and reservoir areas. A total of about 420 ha will be required to make way for \nconstruction, of which 310 ha will be permanently acquired (Appendix 4).  \n \n\n                                                 \n39 ADB. 1995. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n\n\f12 \n\nNo  households  will  be  relocated  in  the  Thuong  My  Trung,  Thach  Han,  and  La  Tinh \n44. \nsubproject areas. One in Thach Thanh, 36 in Tay Nam  Huong Tra, and 46 in Tra  Cau will be \nrequired  to  relocate.  For  the  Tra  Cau  subproject,  villagers  from  Ho  Sau  village  (affected  by \nconstruction  of  the  Chop  Vung  reservoir)  have  elected  to  relocate  to  Pho  Ninh,  where  a \nresettlement  site  will  be  fully  developed  (with  physical  infrastructure,  houses,  irrigation,  water \nand electricity supply, roads, school, and village administration buildings) before their relocation. \nAll  relocated  households  will  be  provided  with  resettlement  assistance,  including  materials \ntransport, transition subsistence, and income restoration allowance.  \n \n45. \nSeverely affected farmers will be offered the option of replacement wherever possible, or \ncash compensation sufficient to purchase replacement land of equivalent area and productivity. \nCompensation for structures will be paid at full  replacement  cost of material and labor without \ndeduction for depreciation or salvageable materials. The livelihood development measures will \nlink with the interventions included in the GAP and EMDP. All costs related to resettlement and \ncompensation  will  be  paid  for  by  the  Government.  PPC  staff  members  will  implement \nresettlement plans with assistance from DARD and project-financed local consultants. \n \n\nd. \n\nImplement Environmental Management Plans \n\n46. \nIn consultation with the provincial agencies, the IEE for each subproject and a summary \nIEE (Supplementary Appendix B) for the whole Project have been prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  environment  policy40  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.41  The  IEE  was \napproved by the DoNRE of each project province. The EMP for each subproject, developed as \npart  of  the  IEE,  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design.  In  collaboration  with  DoNRE  and  the \ndepartment  of  fishery,  a  detailed  site-specific  EMP  will  be  prepared  to  guide  each  PPMU  in \nimplementing  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  monitoring  during  construction  and \noperation phases. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nfor  user \n\ninterventions \n\nthe  potential \n\n47. \nInclusive  Development.  Social  and  institutional  analyses  were  done  by  the  project \npreparatory consultants and these were complemented by participatory pilot and demonstration \nactivities  by  CARE  International  in  Vietnam42  and  World  Vision  Viet  Nam.43  The  social  groups \nand  other  stakeholders  in  each  subproject  were  identified,  and  their  interests,  needs,  and \nexpectations  determined.  The  related  surveys,  discussion  group  activities,  and  workshops \nfamiliarized  local  communities  with  project  objectives;  identified  disadvantaged  groups; \n(design, \ninvolvement \ndetermined \nimplementation, monitoring, and O&M); established baseline indicators; and brought to the fore \nspecific \nto  spread  project  benefits  equitably. \nincluded \nRecommended  approaches  for  improving  participation  in  irrigation  development  to  make  the \ninvestment  more  inclusive  (specific  to  the  subprojects  under  this  Project  but  also  generally \napplicable to irrigation development in Viet Nam) were published (footnote 23) and have been \ndrawn upon to formulate the Project.  \n \nInstitutional Change. Government at all levels is enthusiastic about improving irrigation \n48. \nby making its management more decentralized and participatory. This presents an opportunity \n                                                 \n40  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n41 ADB. 2003. Environment Assessment Guidelines.

It  will  help  bring  to  agriculture  the  benefits  of  SOE  reforms  that  have \nbeen so effective in more industrialized sectors. In some cases, the Project may help privatize \nIMCs,  or  at  least  lay  the  groundwork  for  this  to  happen.  This,  coupled  with  strong  support  for \nPIM,  will  place  the  Project  at  the  forefront  of  the  Government's  reform  agenda  in  irrigated \nagriculture.  Transferring  publicly  held  assets  to  legally  constituted  WUGs  and  WUAs  will \nempower water users to take part in decisions that affect their well-being and increase scheme \nsustainability.  \n \n49. \nSustainability.  The  Project  will  engage  suitable  local  institutions  in  each  province  to \nhelp  create  legally  constituted  WUGs and  WUAs. This will  help develop important  skills within \nViet Nam to continue the institutional reforms being supported under the Project. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  total  project  cost,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties,  is  estimated  to  be \n50. \n$99.0 million. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $37.8 million or 38% of the total project \ncost.  The  local  currency  cost  including  taxes  is  $61.2  million  or  62%  of  the  total  project  cost. \nCost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Summary by Output ($ million) \n \n\nOutput \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nSubtotal (B) \n\n1.

MARD  will  act  as  the  Executing  Agency.  The  director  of  CPO  in  Hanoi \nwill  be  the  project  director.  CPO  will  set  up  a  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  to  (i) \nprovide overall  management and coordination  of the Project, (ii) liaise  with PPC and DARD  in \neach  province  to  improve  irrigation  management  systems,  (iii)  guide  and  coordinate  DARD  to \nimprove irrigation infrastructure, (iv) implement the PPMS, (v) procure consulting services, 44 (vi) \ncoordinate with the PPMU in each province to procure goods and services through international \ncompetitive bidding (see para. 56), (vii) prepare forecasts of contract awards and disbursements \nand  arrange  project  account  audits,  (viii)  prepare  major  reports  covering  the  whole  Project  by \nconsolidating  the  reports  from  each  province,  and  (ix)  prepare  the  project  completion  report. \nProject management consultants will assist the CPMU. \n \n53. \nThe  vice  minister  of  MARD  will  head  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  set  up  to \nprovide policy and strategy advice and to communicate project outcomes with other ministries. \nThe  PSC  will  comprise  representatives  at  the  director  level  of  the  ministries  of  planning  and \ninvestment, finance, and natural resources and environment; the Office of Government; and the \nState Bank of Vietnam. The organization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 7.  \n \n54. \nProvincial Level. In each province PPMU will be created under the direct administration \nof  DARD.  Each  PPMU  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  subproject  manager  with  qualifications \nacceptable  to  ADB.  PPMU,  assisted  by  consultants,  will  improve  irrigation  management \nsystems  (output  1),  improve  irrigation  infrastructure  (output  2),  procure  goods  and  services \nusing  local  competitive  bidding,  operationalize  the  PPMS,  and  implement  resettlement,  EMP, \nGAP, HIV/AIDS awareness program, and (in the Tra Cau subproject) an EMDP. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5\u00bd years beginning in 2006 (Appendix 8).  \n\n55. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nCivil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \n56. \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $2  million \nequivalent will be procured through international competitive bidding among pre-qualified firms \nwith proven technical competence acceptable to ADB. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $2 \nmillion  or  less  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.  SOEs  will  be \n\n                                                 \n44 Other than domestic consulting services to be used only for a particular subproject. \n\n\f  15\n\neligible  to  bid  for  contracts  if  they  are  financially  autonomous,  independently  managed,  and \noperate on the basis of commercial practice.  \n \n57. \nEquipment to be procured under the Project includes vehicles, motorcycles, computers, \nsoftware,  and  water  quality  monitoring  equipment.45  Such  equipment  will  be  procured  by \ninternational competitive bidding where the cost is more than $1 million, international shopping \nwhere the cost is $500,000 to $1 million per package, and local competitive bidding where the \ncost is less than $500,000. Where local suppliers are few, procurement may be made by direct \npurchase, with a threshold of $100,000, as will be the case for negotiated service contracts with \nNGOs. Indicative procurement packages are shown in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n58. \nThe  Project  will  require  227  person-months  of  domestic  and  103  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants.  The  consultants  will  build  the  capacity  of  MARD  and  DARD  to  (i) \ndevelop  and  operationalize  IMC  business  plans,  (ii)  create  and  operationalize  PPMS  using  a \nGIS, and (iii) coordinate and supervise project implementation. At the central level, expertise will \nbe  required  in  institutional  development,  water  resources  and  irrigation  planning,  information \ndatabases,  gender,  environment,  sociology,  and  GIS.  At  the  provincial  level,  expertise  will  be \nrequired  in  institutional  development,  business  strategic  planning,  financial  and  economic \nmanagement, irrigation, data processing, legal processes, agronomy, and PIM. Local consulting \nfirms,  NGOs,  and  institutions  will  be  engaged  to  provide  training,46  implement  the  GAP  and \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  create  WUGs/WUAs,  complete  the  final  design  of  works  and \nhelp  supervise  their  construction,  and  monitor  performance.  All  consulting  firms,  NGOs,  and \ninstitutions will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.47  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n59. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  MARD. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MARD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers to the \nProject. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n60. \nThe  Government  will  open  a  first-generation  imprest  account  in  a  bank  acceptable  to \nADB,  into  which  loan  funds  from  ADB  will  be  deposited,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  updated  from  time  to  time.  Similarly,  each  of  the \nproject  provinces  will  establish  a  second-generation  imprest  account,  in  a  bank  acceptable  to \nADB,  for  local  project  expenditures.  The  total  combined  advances  in  the  first-  and  second-\n                                                 \n45  Equipment  to  be  incorporated  into  civil  works,  such  as  fabricated  steel  and  other  special  components,  electrical \n\nand mechanical equipment, pumps, and motors, will be included in the civil works contracts.  \n46 Including a program to educate WUGs/WUAs in relation to legal empowerment and legal literacy. \n47 The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used for the selection of international consultants. \n\n\f16 \n\ngeneration imprest accounts at any time during project implementation will not be greater than \nthe  estimated  expenditure  for  the  coming  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nlower.  The  ceiling  of  the  second-generation  imprest  account  in  each  province  will  be  the \nestimated local expenditure for the coming 6 months or $500,000, whichever is lower. Payments \nto  civil  works  contractors  will  be  made  directly  by  ADB,  or  from  the  imprest  accounts  as \nappropriate  (see  fund  flow  arrangement  in  Appendix  7).  For  payments  up  to  $100,000,  ADB's \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to \nliquidate advances. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n61. \nCPO,  assisted  by  the  CPMU,  will  monitor  and  consolidate  accounts  for  each  province \nand  prepare  a  separate  account  for  the  Project  as  a  whole.  Within  12  months  of  loan \neffectiveness,  CPMU  will  establish  a  computerized  management  information  system  suited  to \nthe financial management and reporting needs of the Project. A qualified firm will be recruited to \naudit  project  accounts  annually.  The  audited  accounts  and  auditor's  report  (including  the \nauditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  operations)  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB not more than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n62. \nEach agency directly involved in the Project (MARD, PPC, DARD) will prepare progress \nreports every 6 months. These will be submitted within 1 month to CPO for consolidation at the \nproject level and submission to ADB. The reports will describe progress in achieving design and \nmonitoring  framework  targets  (Appendix  3),  any  problems  encountered  and  steps  taken  to \nresolve  them,  and  activities  for  the  next  reporting  period.  MARD  will  prepare  and  submit  a \nproject completion report in the standard ADB format not more than 6 months after the physical \ncompletion of the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n63. \nThe  basis  for  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  the  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  and  the  baseline  surveys  specified  in  it  (Appendix  3).  NGOs  will  be \nengaged  to  lead  participatory  baseline  surveys  in  each  irrigation  subproject,  and  to  conduct \nfollow-up  surveys  to  monitor  change.  MARD  will  also  monitor  the  Project  as  part  of  ADB\u2019s \nstandard procedures for disbursement of funds and progress reporting.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n64. \nADB will conduct semiannual reviews facilitated by MARD. The reviews will (i) examine \nthe  appropriateness  of  implementation  arrangements  and  schedules  of  activities,  including \nfunds flow; (ii) assess the level of farmer participation in project activities; (iii) review compliance \nwith  agreed  procurement  procedures;  (iv)  analyze  the  outcomes  of  the  capacity  building  and \ntraining programs; and (v) monitor the effectiveness of safeguard procedures. A comprehensive \nmidterm project review will be undertaken jointly by ADB and the Government. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocial Benefits and Impacts \n\nBeneficiaries. About 400,500 people in the subproject areas will benefit from increased \n65. \nagricultural income and more jobs. Many of them will benefit from natural disaster risk reduction \nand improved water supply for domestic use.  \n\n\f  17\n\n \n66. \nPoverty  Reduction.  About  38%  of  the  beneficiary  households  of  the  subprojects  are \nbelow the poverty line of $0.33 per person per day,48 well above the national average of 24%. \nFarm benefits (after financing) with the Project would be D8 million\u2013D15 million for a farm of 1 \nha,  compared  with  D3  million\u2013D9  million  without  the  project.  Generally,  farm  benefits  are \nexpected to double and lift at least 6,000 households above the poverty line. The social analysis \nshowed  that  the  burden  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  is  disproportionately  borne  by  women. \nFemale-headed  households  constitute  on  average  25%  of  all  households  in  the  project  area. \nThey are particularly vulnerable to poverty on account of their limited access to land, adult labor, \ncredit, capital, and technology. Fewer female-headed than male-headed households derive their \nmain  income  from  agriculture  and  forestry  activities  and  a  much  higher  proportion  derive  their \nmain income from wage labor. A GAP will be implemented to help counter these imbalances. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n67. \nGender  and  Development.  The  GAP  will  ensure  that  female  farmers,  female-headed \nhouseholds, and women of ethnic minority communities are targeted for (i) capacity building for \neffective participation in planning and decision making, (ii) representation in WUGs/WUAs, and \n(iii)  health  education  focused  on  managing  risks  of  HIV/AIDS.  Training  of  female  farmers  by \nVWU  staff  members  will  cover  leadership  and  decision  making,  participatory  water  resources \nplanning,  and  business  management  of  organizations.  Staff  members  of  DARD  and  the  IMCs \nwill  join  gender  sensitization  programs  to  build  their  capacity  and  skills  to  deliver  services \neffectively to female farmers. The PPMU will ensure that the Project\u2019s agricultural extension and \ntraining  programs  will  have  not  less  than  40%  female  trainees.  All  WUGs/WUAs  to  be \ndeveloped under the Project will have female membership of not less than 40%. The Project will \nsupport  HIV/AIDS-related  awareness  raising  to  counter  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  among  male  and \nfemale  migrant  workers  and  reduce  risks  of  infection  among  local  populations  through  in-\nmigration of construction workers. The program will target high-risk population groups, including \ncontractors, construction workers, migrants. \n \n68. \nDisadvantaged  Groups  and  Ethnic  Minorities.  In  four  subproject  areas,  the  ethnic \nminority  population  is  small  (less  than  5%)  and  inter-mixed  with  Kinh  and,  in  accordance  with \nADB's  policy  on  indigenous  peoples,49  the  Project  should  not  make  distinctions  based  on \nethnicity.  The  Project  will  identify  and  assist  all  poor  and  vulnerable  households  regardless  of \nethnicity. In the Thach Thanh scheme (Thanh Hoa Province) the Muong represent 58% of the \npopulation  but  they  are  totally  integrated  with  the  Kinh,  having  adopted  Kinh  style  of  dress, \nlanguage,  farming  methods,  and  social  systems.  They  no  longer  maintain  any  traditions  or \ncustoms  that  reflect  a  uniqueness  or  potential  vulnerability  of  culture.  For  the  Tra  Cau \nsubproject  (Quang  Ngai  Province)  where  a  commune  of  100%  Hre  people  will  lose  land,  an \nEMDP has been prepared (Appendix 5). \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n69. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  It  will  improve  agricultural \nproduction and water supply for domestic use and render the subproject areas less vulnerable \nto natural disasters. The Project will change land use irreversibly in scattered small areas, but \nthe environmental impacts will be minor because changes in cropped and forested areas will be \nsmall.  The  Project  will  have  limited  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and  operation. \n                                                 \n48  A threshold of D1.7 million per person per year (or D150,000 per person per month) has been used, because the \nMinistry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs standard (and that used by the provinces) is considered to be a less \naccurate reflection of poverty. \n\n49 ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila \n\n\f18 \n\nEnvironmental impacts related to construction are short term and will be mitigated to acceptable \nlevels  with  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  and  good  engineering  practice.  Potential  long-\nterm  impacts  such  as  water  pollution  caused  by  increased  use  of  chemicals  for  irrigation  and \naquaculture  will  be  minimized  with  ongoing  chemical-use  training  and  the  proposed  water \nquality monitoring. Although it has been concluded that a detailed EIA for each subproject is not \nrequired, this will be reexamined during detailed design. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits \n\n70. \nQuantified  Benefits.  The  main  project  benefits  are  from  incremental  output  of \nagricultural  production,  deriving  from  (i)  higher  cropping  intensities,  especially  in  areas  under \nrain-fed cultivation; (ii) higher yields because of reliable and full irrigation water supply; and (iii) \nincremental  output  from  shrimp  and  fish  farming.  The  main  crops  cultivated  in  the  subproject \nareas are rice, sugarcane, groundnut, and maize. The subprojects would increase the cultivated \narea from 52,432 ha without the Project to 57,755 ha with the Project. Aquaculture development \ntakes place in Thuong My Trung with over 3,000 ha, based on fish raising in rice fields during \nthe summer and autumn; in Tra Cau with 450 ha of shrimp raising in the winter and spring and \n300  ha  in  the  summer  and  autumn  seasons,  in  La  Tinh  with  300  ha  of  shrimp  raising  in  the \nwinter  and  spring  and  in  the  summer  and  autumn,  and  in  south  Thach  Han  with  200  ha  of \nshrimp farming.  \n \n71. \nNonquantified  Benefits.  The  Project  will  significantly  change  the  way  irrigation \nschemes  are  managed  in  the  subprojects,  giving  much  greater  autonomy  to  IMCs  and  water \nuser  groups,  reducing  transaction  costs  at  all  levels  of  their  operations,  and  helping  the \nGovernment phase out subsidies for O&M in the benefiting schemes. Roads to be constructed \nunder  the  Project  will  provide  better  rural  transportation  and  access  to  markets.  Increased \nagricultural  production  will  contribute  to  the  agricultural  processing  industry  in  the  areas, \nespecially in sugar factories. Increased incomes will be reflected in increased trade in nonfarm \ngoods  and  services.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  in  some  remote  areas  with  a  high \nproportion of ethnic minority groups.  \n \n72. \nEconomic Evaluation. The estimated Project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is \n15%  including  institutional  strengthening  inputs.  All  subprojects  are  economically  viable  with \nEIRRs of 14\u201317%. Sensitivity analyses show that the economic feasibility of the subprojects is \nsensitive to (i) the success of aquaculture development, especially in the Thuong My Trung, Tra \nCau, and La Tinh subprojects; and (ii) the timing of agricultural development, which is strongly \nrelated  to  completion  of  tertiary  canals  and  related  on-farm  development.  The  economic \nfeasibility of the subprojects is  less  sensitive to  changes in investment  cost. The financial and \neconomic evaluation is in Appendix 11. \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\n73. \nThe main risks arise from delays in realizing benefits\u2014the Project\u2019s economic viability is \nsensitive to this. Possible causes of delay are slowness in recruiting consultants and appointing \nappropriate  central  and  provincial  project  management  staff,  resistance  of  vested  interests  to \nchanges  in  organizational  structure  of  service  providers  (IMCs  and  agricultural  cooperatives), \ncumbersome  administrative  processes  related  to  contract  awards,  and  insensitive  handling  of \nresettlement.  Resettlement  and  compensation  of  people  affected  by  construction  are  on  the \ncritical path because the award of civil works contracts is conditional upon their prior completion. \nProject  consultants  will  help  the  provincial  authorities  complete  resettlement  on  schedule. \n\n\f  19\n\nMARD has experience in, and a good understanding of Government and ADB requirements for \nresettlement. \n \n74. \nSlow  farmer  adoption  of  irrigated  agricultural  production  systems  could  delay  the \nbenefits. The economic analysis assumes that the whole target command area will be irrigated \nby the completion of each subproject or shortly after, and that cropping systems will have been \nadapted in the third year after completion. Three factors are expected to minimize these risks. \nFirst,  farmers  usually  respond  quickly  if  they  have  access  to  water,  and  if  special  attention  is \ngiven  to  agricultural  extension  and  other  support  services.  Second,  experience  in  and \nknowledge of irrigated agriculture are widespread because a large part of the subproject areas \nis  being  irrigated.  Third,  beneficiary  participation  specifically  supported  by  the  Project  will \nincrease  farmers\u2019  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  restructuring  IMCs  and  the  concomitant \nconceding  of  powers  to  WUGs/WUAs,  and  will  have  involved  farmers  closely  in  the  planning \nand  implementation  (often  as  contracted  labor)  of  on-farm  development.  Agriculture  extension \nservices  will  support  rapid  uptake  by  disseminating  information  and  demonstrating  improved \ntechniques. With this amount of support, a high level of participation should be assured. \n \n75. \nAlthough  MARD  and  the  provincial  agencies  are  experienced  in  implementing  physical \nworks,  there  are  less  so  in  the  participatory  and  integrated  approach  needed  for  this  Project. \nThe strong support of MARD (through DWR), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, \nMinistry of Finance, and Ministry of Planning and Investment at central level, and of PPC, DPI, \nDARD,  and  DoNRE  at  the  provincial  level  will  be  critical  to  achieving  the  desired  institutional \nchanges. These changes will require shifts in strategies, regulations, and guidelines relating to \nirrigation service delivery. Overcoming these risks will be the Project\u2019s most important task.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MARD  have  given  the \n\n76. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n \n\n(i) \n\nBusiness plans. Each project-related IMC will develop its own business plan for \nachieving  financial  sustainability  through  structural  and  organizational  changes, \nincluding definition of key functions, service, equipment and skills requirements, \nbudgets,  information  flows,  accounting  procedures,  performance  monitoring, \nwater  pricing  strategy,  and  financing  plan.  Business  plans  shall  set  out  annual \ntargets  and  milestones,  the  achievement  of  which  will  trigger  release  of  project \nfunds  to  IMCs.  Each  business  plan  will  need  to  be  approved  by  a  respective \nPPC, and to be satisfactory to ADB.  \nWUGs/WUAs.  Release  of  project  funds  to  a  WUG/WUA  will  be  subject  to  its \nbeing registered as a legal entity by the respective provincial authority.  \nWater fees. By the end of the second year of project implementation, water fees \nwill  be  determined  and  established  in  accordance  with  IMCs\u2019  business  plan  to \nachieve  and  maintain  the  financial  autonomy  of  IMCs  and  WUGs  (i.e.,  full \nrecovery of O&M costs), subject to applicable laws and regulations. \nAward  of  contracts.  Construction  contracts  for  any  subproject  will  be  awarded \nonly after (a) a business plan for the respective IMC has been approved by PPC \nand ADB; (b) all resettlement and compensation required for the subproject have \nbeen completed according to its resettlement plan; and (c) certification has been \ngiven that the site has been cleared of unexploded ordnance. \nSocial issues. The GAP and EMDPs will be implemented throughout the project \nimplementation  period,  monitored,  and  reported  every  6  months  to  ADB.  The \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n\f20 \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n(viii) \n\nEMDPs  prepared  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with the EMDF. The EMDP for the Tra Cau subproject in Quang Ngai \nProvince will be updated and submitted to ADB for approval. \nResettlement:  All  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  under  the  Project \nwill  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of \nViet Nam, requirements of the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, and the \nresettlement  plans.  Prior  to  the  start  of  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities, the Government will have (a) updated the resettlement plans based on \nthe detailed design for the subprojects and submitted them to ADB for approval, \nand (b) signed a contract with a qualified social science or other suitably qualified \ninstitution  acceptable  to  ADB  to  conduct  independent  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the resettlement process and impacts. \nEnvironment:  The  Project  facilities  will  be  constructed  and  operated  in \ncompliance  with  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  Viet  Nam, \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and regulations, IEEs, and SIEE. The EMP for \neach  subproject  will  be  updated  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  final \napproval of the subproject detailed design. Mitigation measures detailed in EMPs \nwill be implemented and monitored to a satisfactory standard \nRegulatory  Framework.  The  Government  shall  adopt,  within  twelve  months  of \nthe  effective  date,  necessary  regulatory  framework  with  revised  institutional \narrangements for management of irrigation  systems at provincial and commune \nlevels  to  enable  achievement  of  the  project  objectives  more  effectively.  In \nparticular,  the  Government  shall  take  necessary  measures  to  restructure  IMCs, \nWUGs, and WUAs and transfer the ownership for irrigation assets to IMCs, and \nWUGs,  and  WUAs,  as  appropriate.  The  restructuring  of  IMCs  shall  include  the \nauthority to set, collect, and allocate water fees. \n\n \nA. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n77. \nPrior to loan effectiveness (i)  the  PSC,  CPMU,  and  PPMUs  shall  be  established  and \nmade operational in a manner satisfactory to ADB; and (ii) the project implementation guidelines \nspecifying  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  CPMU,  PPMUs,  PPCs,  and  other  relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  and  the  arrangements  for  the  flow  of  funds  under  the  Project  shall  be \napproved by MARD.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n78. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  52,128,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \nNam for the Central Region Water Resources Project from ADB's Special Funds resources with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance  with those  set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n28 November 2005 \n\n\fINSTITUTIONAL REFORM FOR IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nInstitutional Context \n\n1. \n\nNational Level Agencies \n\n1. \nThe Law on Water Resources, which became effective in 1999, assigns the Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)1  as  the  lead  agency  to  implement  and  manage \nwater resources projects, mainly irrigation and drainage, flood protection, rural water supply and \nsanitation,  typhoon  protection  measures,  and  most  major  hydraulic  structures.  MARD  also \nmanages  some  hydropower  schemes2  whose  primary  purpose  is  flood  protection,  and  some \nnational parks and conservation sites. Its Department of Water Resources (DWR) is responsible \nfor  preparing  development  plans  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  irrigation  and \ndrainage schemes, and for overseeing rural water use.  \n \n2. \nIn 2002, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) was created and \ngiven  responsibility  for  state  management  of  natural  resources  and  the  environment.  This \neffectively separated state water management functions from public water service delivery, both \nof  which  functions  had  previously  been  held  by  MARD.  The  process  of  rationalizing  the  roles \nand  functions  of  the  many  agencies  involved  in  water  management,  and  of  establishing \nprinciples, guidelines, and accompanying regulatory systems for implementing integrated water \nresources  management  (IWRM),  is  underway.3  MoNRE  has  been  charged  with  preparing  the \nnational  water  resources  strategy  (NWRS)  for  consideration  of  Cabinet  by  end-2005.4  MARD \nand MoNRE are both finalizing their 5-year plans for 2006\u20132010. \n \n3. \nThe  Ministries  of  Planning  and  Investment,  Finance,  Construction,  Industry,  Fisheries, \nHealth, and Transport, among others, play a role in water resources management and related \nissues. The Law on Water Resources defines the role of the National Water Resource Council \n(NWRC)5  to  advise  the  Government  on  water  resource  management,  and  related  national \nstrategies and action plans. It also provides for the establishment of river basin organizations as \nthe appropriate institutions to manage water resources.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLocal Government Agencies \n\n4. \nEach level of local administration has a legislative body in the form of a people\u2019s council \n(PC). The provincial PC is the highest representative of state authority with offices at province, \ndistrict, and commune levels. Citizens elect members to all PCs. PCs approve and monitor the \nimplementation of local development plans, and now have responsibility for mobilizing financial \nresources and supervising expenditures.6 \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The Ministry of Water Resources was restructured in 1995 as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n2 The Ministry of Industry constructs, operates, and manages most of the country\u2019s hydropower plants as part of its \n\nresponsibility for managing national energy policy. \n\n3 ADB, with the support of the governments of Denmark and the Netherlands, has provided technical assistance to \n\nboth MARD and MoNRE.  \n\n2005. \n\n4   Refer to the minutes of meeting from the Seventh National Water Resource Council (NWRC) meeting on 11 April \n\n5  The  NWRC,  chaired  by  the  vice  prime  minister,  advises  the  Government  on  strategies  and  policies  for  national \nwater  resources,  river  basin  plans,  inter-basin  diversions,  large-scale  water  resource  projects  requiring  cabinet \napproval,  internationally  shared  water  resources,  and  resolution  of  conflicts  regarding  competing  uses.  Eleven \nministries are represented on the NWRC. \n\n6   The State Budget Law of 2004. \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nThe provincial people\u2019s ccommittee (PPC) is elected by and is the executive agency of \n5. \nthe  PC  in  each  province.  It  implements  PC  resolutions  and  reports  outcomes  to  the  PC  while \nalso answering to higher levels of government. It is therefore subject to the principle of double \nsubordination, being accountable to the PC at the same administrative level and to the National \nPeople\u2019s Committee and central Government agencies. The PC approves decisions of the PPC \nand monitors their implementation.  \n \n6. \nAt  the  provincial  level,  the  various  ministries  are  represented  through  departments \ncreated  under  and  managed  by  the  PPC.  This  pattern  of  representation  is  repeated  at  the \ndistrict  and  commune  levels,  although  not  all  departments  are  represented  at  lower \nadministrative levels. Below the commune are the village and hamlet social divisions, led by a \nvillage or hamlet head, and without official government administrative offices. \n \n7. \nThe  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD)  is  responsible  for  the \nprovincial  agriculture,  forestry,  irrigation,  rural  enterprise,  and  rural  development  sectors.  They \nare  directly  under  the  authority  of  PPC  but  receive  professional  guidance  and  oversight  from \nMARD. DARDs have a number of specialist divisions for administration, planning and financing, \nirrigation,  agriculture,  forestry,  and,  in  some  provinces,  fisheries.  In  most  provinces,  DARDs \nhave subdepartments or centers for plant protection, veterinary services, agricultural extension, \nseed and seedling production, construction management, and rural development projects (e.g., \nfor  markets  and  roads).  DARD  is  responsible  for  planning  new  irrigation  development  and \nrehabilitation  of  existing  schemes,  project  appraisals  and  feasibility  studies,  approval  of  the \ndesigns  of  small  hydraulic  structures  (large  hydraulic  structures  are  approved  by  MARD),  and \nmanagement of the irrigation management companies (paras. 11\u201313) and other provincial state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs).  \n \n8. \nThe  department  of  natural  resources  and  environment  (DoNRE)  has  provincial \nresponsibility  for  land  administration,  water  resources,  mineral  resources,  and  environmental \nprotection  and  conservation.  DoNREs,  being  new,  have  few  experienced  staff  members  and \nlimited  resources.  Increasingly,  DoNREs  will  be  important  in  developing  provincial  level \ninterpretations of the NWRS whose development is being led by MoNRE.  \n \nAn  important  provincial  level  department  is  the  department  of  planning  and  investment \n9. \nwhich  helps  the  PPC  manage  investments.  It  is  a  focal  point  for  other  provincial  departments \nand collates socioeconomic development plans, recommends policies and means of attracting \ninvestment,  and  manages  foreign  and  domestic  investments.  It  is  under  PPC\u2019s  direct \nmanagement and the sectoral guidance of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \n \n10. \nDistricts  are  the  key  level  of  government  for  agricultural,  forestry,  and  fisheries \ndevelopment. Each district is divided into 15\u201320 communes with an average population of about \n5,000. Districts are therefore responsible for providing services and infrastructure to populations \nof about 80,000\u2013100,000. Communes typically have 11\u201315 staff members in the commune PC \nand  a  number  of  mass  organizations  (women,  farmers,  youth,  war  veterans,  etc.),  which  are \ngrouped under the roof of the Viet Nam Fatherland Front and provide a forum for members to \narticulate views about political, social, and economic processes.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nB. \n\nInstitutions for Irrigation Management \n\n3. \n\nIrrigation Management Companies/Enterprises \n\nIrrigation  schemes  (including  drainage  and  flood  protection  schemes)  serve  more  than \n11. \n2.6 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land through thousands of small- and 75 medium-scale \nto large-scale schemes. The primary institution for operation and maintenance (O&M) of these \nare the irrigation (and drainage) management companies (IMCs), established under law as non-\nprofit  SOEs  reporting  to  the  PPC  through  DARD.7  About  130  IMCs  serve  63%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nirrigated  area.  The  remainder  is  served  by  some  of  the  more  than  10,000  agricultural \ncooperatives and 2,000 water user groups (WUGs). \n \nIMCs may encompass several irrigation management enterprises (IMEs), which can be \n12. \nconsidered  a  branch  organization  serving  one  or  more  irrigation  schemes.  Many  IMEs  were \noriginally established as IMCs, based on the scheme-level organization of water management at \nthe time, with DARD acting as the coordinating body for the river basin or province. The creation \nof provincial (or river basin) IMCs drew responsibility for water management away from DARD.8 \nThe  IMCs,  which  each  serve  an  individual  scheme,  were  renamed  IMEs.  This  took  place  in \n1998, when guidelines for the organization and operation of IMCs were introduced. \n \nIMCs\u2019  responsibilities  include  planning  and  management  of  O&M  of  the  schemes, \n13. \ndelivery  of  irrigation  water,  management  of  construction  activities,  collection  of  irrigation  (or \nwater  user)  fees,  management  of  the  schemes\u2019  finances,  and  support  for  IMEs  (para.  18). \nAnnual  targets  for  each  IMC  are  set  by  the  PPC  in  coordination  with  DARD  on  the  basis  of \nMARD\u2019s Guidelines on the Organization and Operation of Irrigation Management Companies.9 \nWater  allocations  for  the  schemes  are  based  on  their  design  capacity  and  are  approved  by \nMARD and the PPC.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAgricultural Cooperatives \n\n14. \nFarmers  have  direct  representation  in  agricultural  cooperatives  which  provide  such \nservices as irrigation water, seed, fertilizer, and extension. The primary service provided by the \ncooperatives  is  irrigation.  Cooperatives  enter  into  contracts  with  IMCs  for  supply  of  water \n(frequently  through  the  intermediary  of  irrigation  stations),  which  they  then  deliver  to  farmers\u2019 \nfields. Under the terms of the contracts, cooperatives are allowed to collect water user fees on \nbehalf of the IMCs and retain a portion of these to cover their own costs.10 IMCs are responsible \nfor  maintaining  the  primary  and  secondary  canals  and  structures  and  cooperatives  for \nmaintaining secondary and tertiary canals. Some cooperatives are reluctant to reveal the actual \nland area irrigated to IMCs so that they can retain a greater amount of the collected fees. They \nhave  large  membership  (up  to  2,000  members),  which  hinders  transparency  and  limits \nopportunities for widespread participation. \n\n                                                 \n7   DARDs  have  policy  responsibility  for  irrigation  water  use  and  interpretation  of  national  policy,  regulations,  and \n\nstandards as disseminated by MARD. \n\n8   For example, there is now one provincial IMC each in Binh Dinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, and Thua Thien Hue \n\nprovinces, and one per river basin in Quang Tri and Thanh Hoa provinces.  \n\n9   Circular No. 6/1998/TT-BNN-TCCB. \n10  Cooperatives are often also responsible for collecting taxes from farmers. \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nC. \n\nIssues Affecting Performance of Irrigation \n\n15. \nTwo major constraints on water resource management limit Viet Nam\u2019s ability to meet its \nrural  development  targets:  (i)  an  institutional  setting  that  encourages  service  providers\u2019 \ndependence on government grants for O&M, and (ii) inefficient allocation of financial and other \nresources.  \n \n16. \nSpecific  issues  affecting  irrigation  management  have  been  reported  in  the  institutional \nanalysis  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Central \nRegion  Water  Resources  Project;11  related  pilot  and  demonstration  activities  undertaken  by \nCARE International in Vietnam12 and World Vision Viet Nam;13 the project completion report on \nthe  Irrigation  and  Flood  Protection  Rehabilitation  Project;14  a  special  evaluation  study  on \nparticipatory  approaches  in  forest  and  water  resource  operations;15  reviews  of  the  ongoing \nSecond  Red  River  Basin  Sector  Project;16  a  working  paper  on  water-related  legal  and \ninstitutional,  and  economic  and  financial  arrangements;17  and  studies  on  (i)  development  of \nprovincial  water  resource  investment  strategies,18  (ii)  development  and  establishment  of  new \nmodels for irrigation and drainage services,19 and (iii) integrated water management in pumped \nirrigation systems in the red river delta of Viet Nam.20 The major findings are summarized below. \n \n17. \nIrrigation  Management  Companies.  The  operations  of  IMCs  are  guided  by  a  set  of \ncentrally  defined  rules  and  regulations.21  At  the  provincial  level,  the  PPC  has  some  leeway, \nwithin  the  limit  of  the  laws  and  decrees,  to  make  adjustments  to  these  to  suit  provincial \nconditions.  Nevertheless,  strategic  decisions  relating  to  area  of  intervention,  budget  and \ninvestment  planning,  setting  of  water  user  fees,  personnel  planning  (e.g.,  nomination  of \nmanagerial staff) are decided by external agents (PPC, DARD, MARD). Hence, the director of \nan  IMC  has  limited  scope  to  improve  IMC  performance  in  relation  to  quality  of  service,  work \nmethods, work planning, staff levels and skills, and user participation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2004.

A  detailed  analysis  of  the  project  area  IMCs  was  made \n18. \nduring the project preparatory TA. The analysis aimed to determine the IMCs\u2019 strengths in terms \nof external22 and internal23 factors. In terms of their cultural (or external) environment, none of \nthe IMCs is modern, most are either traditional or intermediate. Critically, all the IMCs have low \nscores for cost-efficiency, effectiveness, autonomy, and accountability, and are therefore at risk \nof failure. A simple measure of this can be seen by the fact that IMCs are only completing 20\u2013\n30% of the required maintenance even though they receive state subsidies in addition to user \nfees.  IMCs  in  the  project  area  are  characterized  as  traditional,  strongly  risk-averse  institutions \nwith  centralized  leadership  styles  that  limit  participation  of  lower-level  stakeholders  in  decision \nmaking.  \n \nIMC  Performance.  Water  user  fees  in  Viet  Nam  are  high  by  international  standards.24 \n19. \nHence,  the  failure  of  IMCs  to  meet  water  delivery  targets  or  to  undertake  maintenance \nthroughout  the  command  area  is  not  due  to  a  shortage  of  income.  Other  factors  include  the \nfollowing: (i) water delivery is often unrelated to the cropping patterns of the areas served;25 (ii) \nmany farmers are reluctant to pay user fees when water is not delivered in adequate quantities \nor at the correct time,26 or when farmers located further upstream are seen to have preferential \naccess to water;27 (iii) IMCs use the income generated from user fees to meet recurrent costs \nand sometimes also as a source of general revenue (controlled by the PPC) for new works and \nscheme extensions;28 (iv) fees collected by the agricultural cooperatives are not always passed \nto the IMCs as they should be, and the cooperatives themselves sometimes divert revenue from \nfees  to  other  uses;29  (v)  some  farmers  use  water  without  paying  (non-revenue  water  to  the \nIMC);30  (vi)  the  ceiling  for  fees  in  any  year  is  set  by  the  PPC  and  is  more  closely  related  to \nrecurrent costs of IMC staff and operations than to O&M needs, thus encouraging the belief that \nmaintenance of the schemes is a state responsibility.  \n \n20. \nFinancial Sustainability. The pricing of irrigation water services is done in a fragmented \nmanner.  The  Department  of  Price  Management  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  sets  a \nprice bracket for different services, and MARD then develops guidelines for specific fee levels. \nThese two instruments are used by PPCs to determine location-specific fee levels. IMCs do not \nhave  the  authority  to  decide  fees  nor  to  base  them  on  business  principles.  This  constrains \nfinancial sustainability because, although IMCs receive a significant subsidy from the provincial \nadministration,  they  are  nonprofitable.  They  are  thus  caught  in  the  middle\u2014they  do  receive \n                                                 \n22  Includes  (i)  attitudes  toward  entrepreneurship,  delegation,  and  consultation;  (ii)  leadership  style;  (iii)  legal  basis; \n\nand (iv) mission. \n\nand (iv) accountability. \n\n23 Whether the IMCs are giving a satisfactory outcome in terms of (i) cost efficiency; (ii) effectiveness; (iii) autonomy; \n\n24 Fees for full gravity service vary among the six target provinces of the Project from VND290,000 to VND490,000 \n\nper hectare ($18\u201332/ha for each season). \n\n25 IMC staff have little knowledge of the areas served, and there is no monitoring mechanism to record actual water \n\nvolumes delivered, their timing, or their source. \n\n26 Contrary to common belief, poor farmers are willing to pay user fees if they see that these are used correctly and \nfairly.  There  is  evidence  of  a  strong  relationship  between  level  of  service  and  the  payment  of  water  user  fees \n(footnote 18). \n\n27 Given that the infrastructure is often poor because it lacks maintenance, farmers at the tail of canals receive less \n\nreliable water services. \n\n28  IMCs  have  not  adjusted  their  business  approach  from  \u201cscheme  developer\u201d  to  \u201cscheme  operator\u201d  and  hence  are \npoorly  structured,  inefficient,  and  costly  in  that  role.  A  large  part  of  revenue  is  used  to  maintain  non-operational \nstaff. \n\n29 For agricultural cooperatives (and therefore the associated Commune), water user fees have become a significant \npart of discretionary revenue. Hence, due to the uncoupling of fees from service, farmers tend to view these fees \nas another form of taxation and therefore have little confidence in the management accountability of cooperatives. \n30  IMCs  lack  the  power  of  a  governmental  agency  to  enforce  policy  and  the  right  to  impose  sanctions  (such  as \n\ncessation of services) that a private company would enjoy in cases of nonpayment. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nsufficient  budgets  and  they  are  not  able  to  raise  water  user  fees.  Understandably,  some \nquarters  exert  pressure  to  increase  water  user  fees.  However,  this  is  only  part  of  the  problem \naffecting financial sustainability.  \n \nIn fairness to the IMCs, it should be noted that local cost norms for O&M have not been \n21. \ndeveloped  for  most  irrigation  schemes.  This  makes  it  difficult  for  IMCs  to  plan  and  allocate \nappropriate budgets, which, in turn, exacerbates an already poor O&M performance and lack of \ntransparency in financial management. The absence of cost norms also frustrates the setting of \nwater user fees and impedes the transfer of irrigation facilities to WUGs. \n \n22. \nTransfer of Ownership of Assets. Various Government documents mention that IMCs \n(which are 100% SOEs) have been given the rights of use, possession, and management of the \ninfrastructure in their irrigation schemes on behalf of the people of Viet Nam. The ownership of \nirrigation infrastructure remains with PPCs at the subnational level. In some provinces, transfer \nof  user  rights  to  cooperatives  and  communes  is  recorded  in  contracts.  Until  this  is  rectified \nthrough  formal  transfer  of  title,  the  responsibility  for  maintenance  or  replacement  of \ninfrastructure will be considered by water users and the IMCs to rest with central Government.  \n \nD. \n\nGovernment Measures to Improve Irrigation Performance \n\nA  key  feature  of  water  resource  management  is  that  many  sectors  have  a  stake  in \n23. \nachieving  greater  efficiency  or  are  highly  susceptible  to  loss  of  access  to  water  of  adequate \nquantity and quality. In the agriculture sector, the full potential of irrigation schemes cannot be \nrealized  so  long  as  water  is  inequitably  distributed,  large  parts  of  the  command  areas  are  not \nserved, or valuable water conveyance infrastructure is allowed to deteriorate. Irrigation currently \nconsumes  a  disproportionately  large  part  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  available  fresh  water  supply  in  lakes, \nrivers,  wetlands,  and  groundwater  reserves.  In  the  face  of  increasing  competition  from  higher \nvalue-added users, irrigation will have to become more efficient.  \n \n24. \nThe Government is pursuing a new policy to improve the performance of irrigation and \ndrainage  schemes,  and  has  realigned  its  strategy  for  water  service  delivery  toward  a  more \ndecentralized  and  participatory  approach.  The  strategy  relies  on  giving  greater  autonomy  to \nservice  providers  while  also  encouraging,  in  a  mutually  beneficial  partnership,  the  active \nparticipation of water users to relieve service providers\u2019 O&M costs. \n \n\n5. \n\nIrrigation Management Companies \n\n25. \nAs a first step, irrigation service providers (IMCs and agricultural cooperatives) need to \nbecome  service-oriented  to  develop  good  management  practices  based  on  principles  of \naccountability  and  transparency.  To  create  an  enabling  environment  for  this,  they  will  need \ngreater flexibility to negotiate directly with water users for delivery of an agreed level of service \nfor  an  appropriate  fee;  and  to  make  decisions  affecting  their  staffing,  charge  rates,  and \nstandards of performance\u2014albeit within a regulatory framework set in place by Government to \nprotect the rights of users.31  \n \n26. \nTo  improve  financial  sustainability,  service  providers  should  collect  fees  from  all  areas \nserved  by  an  irrigation  scheme,32  and  the  revenue  should  be  used  strictly  for  the  purposes \n\n                                                 \n31  The  role  of  water  in  sustaining  life,  livelihoods,  and  health  cannot  be  overlooked,  and  the  state  may  need  to \n\nmanage water in such a way as to protect the poorest segments of society. \n\n32 In line with increasing returns to scale, raising the capacity and customer base will bring down the average cost. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27 \n\nintended  in  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  manner.  As  a  complementary  action,  IMCs  need  to \ndevelop  a  water  pricing  strategy  that  clearly  reflects  the  cost  of  O&M.  To  further  improve \nefficiency  and  reduce  the  cost  of  O&M,  water  users  need  to  be  involved  in  management \ndecisions that affect their well-being (paras. 29\u201333).33 \n \n27. \nIn  accordance  with  the  national  action  plan  for  renovating  and  raising  the  efficiency  of \nirrigation  management34  launched  recently  by  the  minister  of  MARD,  a  regulatory  framework \nenabling provinces to improve their current institutional arrangements is to be put in place by the \nend of 2005. Its focus areas are (i) completion and modernization of infrastructure, (ii) a shift to \nservice-oriented and participatory management, (iii) introduction of mechanisms for financing to \nreduce subsidy levels, and (iv) effective protection of infrastructure from encroachment. \n \nFor unprofitable IMCs, other business models (including conversion to public utilities or \n28. \njoint-stock companies, or transferring full ownership of assets to WUGs), need to be considered \nin  line  with  the  Government's  policy  of  SOE  reform.  In  addition,  the  recent  decree35  on \nproduction  and  supply  of  public  goods  and  services  introduces  a  shift  toward  procurement  of \npublic  services  through  tender  rather  than  \u201cassignment.\u201d  This  would  enable  PPCs  to  contract \nout the provision of O&M for irrigation schemes to IMCs or other eligible groups in a competitive \nmanner based on a clear definition of targets and standards of service.  \n \n\n6. \n\nParticipatory Irrigation Management \n\n29. \nParticipatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  has  been  shown  to  have  the  following \nbenefits: (i) increased water use efficiency, (ii) increased agricultural productivity, (iii) enhanced \nsustainability  of  irrigated  agriculture,  (iv)  reduced  cost  burden  on  the  state  for  O&M,  and  (v) \nreduced water user fees. WUGs (formed by and under the instructions of the commune people\u2019s \ncommittee)  operate  and  maintain  tertiary  level  canals  as  part  of  farmers\u2019  communal \nobligations.36 There are good reasons to extend the scope of such responsibilities to secondary \nand higher-level canals: (i) to create a greater sense of ownership (and counter the perception \nthat  user  fees  are  another  form  of  local  tax),  (ii)  to  operate  and  maintain  the  system  more \nefficiently than state organizations, (iii) to reduce the financial burden of IMCs, and (iv) to help \nresolve conflicts between groups under the same canal system. \n \nIn 1998, the Government enacted the so-called \u201cgrassroots democracy decree\u201d37 which \n30. \nlegalized  people\u2019s  direct  participation  in  local  decision-making  and  aimed  to  enhance  the \ntransparency  of  local  government  actions.  More  recently,  MARD\u2019s  framework  strategy38  on \ndevelopment  of  PIM  in  Viet  Nam  sets  out  its  approach  to  accelerating  PIM.  The  approach \nderived  from  MARD\u2019s  experience  on  a  number  of  pilot  initiatives,  especially  the  technical \n\n                                                 \n33  For  schemes  where  participatory  irrigation  management  has  been  introduced,  benefits  included  (i)  20\u201325%  staff \nreduction in IMCs, (ii) improved services and fee collection rates, (iii) 20% increase in total output because of yield \nincreases from improved water scheduling, (iv) lower demand for water because of more regular water application, \nand (v) lower poverty. \n\n34 Official Document 248/BNN-TL of 31 January 2005. \n35 Government Decree 31/2005/ND-CP of 11 March 2005. \n36  In  effect,  cooperatives  possess  a  pool  of  free  labor  because,  according  to  Ordinance  15/1999/PL-UBTVQH10, \neveryone (men 18\u201345 years old and women 18\u201335 years old) is required to provide 10 days\u2019 community work per \nyear. \n\n37 Decree No. 29/1998/ND-CP on Regulation of the Exercise of Democracy in Communes. \n38  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development.  2004.

Hanoi. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nassistance39 that accompanied the Irrigation and Flood Protection Rehabilitation Project.40 The \nobjectives  of  the  new  framework  are  (i)  to  transfer  local  irrigation  structures  to  farmers  under \nappropriate  irrigation  management  transfer  models  in  conjunction  with  PIM,41  and  (ii)  to  bring \nsignificantly  change  the  role  of  farmers  by  raising  their  responsibility  in  scheme  management, \nthereby reducing the state\u2019s subsidy of O&M.42 \n \n31.  MARD\u2019s  Department  of  Water  Resources  (DWR)  has  been  designated  to  coordinate \nimplementation of the PIM program, and to liaise with national agencies\u2014particularly MPI and \nMOF\u2014and  various  provincial  and  lower  authorities  to  incorporate  PIM  in  all  new  irrigation \ninvestment  projects.  DWR  is  also  responsible  for  monitoring  the  performance  of  the  PIM \nstrategy throughout the country. All IMCs have been instructed to prepare PIM action plans. \n \nExisting WUGs are linked to agricultural cooperatives, which provide a range of services \n32. \nto  their  farmer  members.  A  major  limitation  of  cooperatives  and  other  commune-based \norganizations,  however,  is  that  they  represent  administrative  units  whose  boundaries  seldom \ncoincide with those of irrigation schemes.43 The management of tertiary and secondary canals \nthat span one or more administrative areas requires cooperation among different cooperatives, \na difficult and sometimes costly process. The issue relating to mismatched boundaries has been \nresolved  by  the  \u201cordinance  on  hydraulic  work  exploitation  and  protection\u201d,  which  states  that \n\u201chydraulic works must be implemented in such a way that the systematic nature of the work is \nmaintained without division by administrative demarcation\u201d. The new WUGs should therefore be \nstrictly defined by the physical characteristics of the related irrigation schemes or parts thereof. \n \n33.  WUGs  have  proved  effective  when  supported  by  projects,  but  their  long-term \nsustainability is questionable. To capture the benefits of PIM, the legal status and organizational \nstructure  of  WUGs  need  to  be  clearly  established.  The  size  of  WUGs  should  be  restricted  to \nensure  real  participation.  Hence,  water  user  associations  (WUAs)  will  be  needed  to  ensure \nofficial  representation  of  the  WUGs  in  larger  schemes.  Ultimately,  management  of  all  small \nirrigation  schemes  should  be  transferred  to  local  community  organizations  such  as  WUGs.  In \nlarge-scale  irrigation  and  drainage  schemes,  the  headworks,44  main  canals,  and  complex \nstructures would continue to be managed by IMCs, but lower-level canals and structures could \nbe transferred to WUGs/WUAs after the appropriate conditions have been established.  \n \n\n                                                 \n39  TA  1968-VIE  (ADB.  1993.

During  the  preparatory  studies,  social  analyses  were  carried  out  and  resettlement \nplans prepared for six subprojects (one in each target province): (i) Thach Thanh subproject in \nThanh Hoa Province,  (ii)  Thuong  My  Trung  in  Quang  Binh  Province,  (iii)  Thach  Han  in  Quang \nTri Province, (iv) Tay Nam Huong Tra in Thua Thien Hue Province, (v) Tra Cau in Quang Ngai \nProvince, and (vi) La Tinh Subproject in Binh Dinh Province. \n \nB. \n\nResettlement Principles and Entitlements  \n\n2. \nPolicy  Framework.  The  policy  framework  and  resettlement  entitlements  derive  from \nViet Nam\u2019s laws (principally the revised Land Law of 2003); Decrees 188 and 197; ADB's policy \non  involuntary  resettlement;1  and  the  frameworks  and  entitlement  matrixes  approved  by  the \nGovernment  for  other  projects  in  the  water,  transport,  and  energy  sectors.  Provisions  and \nprinciples  adopted  in  the  resettlement  plans  for  the  Project  will  supersede  the  provisions  of \ndecrees  in  force  in  Viet  Nam  wherever  a  gap  exists.  Such  waivers  of  Vietnamese  law  and \ndecrees  are  provided  for  under  Decree  17/ND-CP  (May  2001),  which  regulates  the \nmanagement and use of official development assistance (ODA).2  \n \n3. \n \n \n\nThe basic principles are the following: \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAcquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people  will  be \nminimized  as  much  as  possible  by  identifying  possible  alternative  project \ndesigns, and social, economic, operational, and engineering solutions that have \nthe least impact on populations in the project area. \nProject-affected people (APs) are defined as those who may stand to lose, as a \nconsequence of the Project, all or part of their physical and nonphysical assets, \nincluding homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, tenancy, \nincome-earning opportunities, social and cultural activities and relationships, and \nother losses that may be identified during resettlement planning. \nAPs,  identified  in  the  project-impacted  areas  on  the  date  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey,  will  be  entitled  to  be  compensated  for  their  lost  assets, \nincomes,  and  businesses  at  full  replacement  cost,  and  will  be  provided  with \nrehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  assist  them  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain \ntheir pre-project living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels. \nfor  compensation  and \nAll  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible \nrehabilitation  assistance,  irrespective  of  tenure  status,  social  or  economic \nstanding,  and  any  such  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving  the \nobjectives outlined above. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1995. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2   Article  29  stipulates  that  where  an  international  aid  agreement  has  provisions  that  are  inconsistent  with  the \n\nprovisions of Viet Nam law, the provisions of the ODA agreement shall prevail. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4     33  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv) \n\n(xv) \n\nLack of legal rights to the assets lost or adversely affected will not bar APs from \nentitlement to such compensation and rehabilitation measures.3  \nReplacement residential and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the \nland that was lost, and will be acceptable to the AP.4  \nThe  rehabilitation  measures  to  be  provided  are  (a)  cash  compensation  at \nreplacement cost without deduction for depreciation or salvageable materials for \nhouses and other structures; (b) full title to replacement agricultural land for land \nof equal productive capacity acceptable to the AP as a priority, or cash in lieu of \nland  at  replacement  cost  at  current  market  value;5  (c)  full  title  to  replacement \nresidential  and  commercial  land  of  equal  size  acceptable  to  the  AP;  (d)  cash \ncompensation  for  crops  and  trees  at  current  market  value;  and  (e)  relocation \nallowances and rehabilitation assistance. \nTemporarily  affected  land  and  communal  infrastructure  will  be  restored  to  pre-\nproject conditions. \nThe compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and \nrehabilitation measures will be in place before the Government and ADB approve \naward of any contract for civil works in the affected area.  \nThe  executing  agency  will  set  in  place  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure \neffective  and  timely  design,  planning,  consultation,  and  implementation  of  the \nland acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \nExisting cultural and religious practices shall be respected and, to the maximum \nextent practical, preserved. \nAdequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover \nthe  costs  of  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  within  the  agreed \nimplementation period.  \nSpecial  measures  shall  be \nthe  resettlement  plan  and \ncomplementary  mitigation  and  enhancement  activities  to  protect  socially  and \neconomically vulnerable groups such as ethnic minority peoples, female-headed \nfamilies, children, and elderly people without support structures, and people living \nin extreme poverty. \nThere shall be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. \nDetails of the resettlement plans shall be disclosed to the APs and any interested \ngroups  in  the  form  of  full  or  summary  resettlement  plans,  or  as  information \n\nincorporated \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n3   People without legal rights are referred to as non-titled in ADB's Operations Manual, and include those who have \nno  recognizable  rights  or  claims  to  the  land  that  they  are  occupying  and/or  using.  The  policy  also  states  that \nrestoration  measures  must  be  determined  in  consultation  with  affected  communities,  including  those  people  who \nmight not be formally recognized in national legislation. Those without legal title to land and/or structures occupied \nor  used  by  them  (e.g.,  squatters)  are  entitled  to  various  options  of  resettlement  assistance,  provided  they \ncultivated/occupied the land before the eligibility cut-off date. Resettlement assistance to non-titled APs will include \ncompensation  for  lost  assets  and  restoration  of  income  and  living  standards.  Assistance  may  also  include \nreplacement  land,  although  there  is  no  entitlement  to  this  for  such  APs.  The  resettlement  package  may  include \nmeasures to ensure that such APs are able to find alternative sites or income sources, depending on their losses. \n4   Where there is not sufficient agricultural land available in villages, the Project will help the communes develop new \nagricultural land wherever this is possible (i.e., conversion of unused land or other non-agricultural land owned by \nthe  commune).  The  Project  will  also  help  communes  prepare  level  residential  land  and  sites  for  livestock  and \nfishponds. \n\n5   \u201cAgricultural land for land of equal productive capacity\u201d means that the land provided as compensation should be \nable to produce the same (or better) yield that the AP was producing on his or her previous land. The production \nshould  be  in  the  planting  season  immediately  following  the  land  acquisition.  It  can  be  for  a  future  period  if \ntransitional allowance equal to the household\u2019s previous yield is provided to the AP household while waiting for the \nland to develop the same productivity as the previous land. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nbooklets and leaflets in a language that can be understood by the APs and in an \naccessible place (such as project and commune offices).  \n\n \n4. \nEntitlement  Matrix.  The  entitlement  matrix  in  Table  1  summarizes  the  main  types  of \nlosses  and  the  corresponding  nature  and  scope  of  entitlement,  updated  in  accordance  with \nDecree 197.  \n\nTable A41: Summary Entitlement Matrix \n\nTypes of Losses \n\nLoss of Land \n\nAll temporarily affected land (i.e., used for right of way \nor access for not more than 1 year) \n\nPermanent  loss  of  residential  and  garden,  agricultural, \nand forest land \nSevere  effects  (loss  of  10  %  or  more  of  productive \nland) \n\nLoss of Structures (residential and commercial) \n\nPrimary (shops, houses) and secondary structures \n\nRelocation \n\nCrop and Tree Loss \n\nStanding crops \n\nTrees \n\nAllowances and Assistance for Livelihood Stabilization \n\nTransportation for relocating APs \n\nTransition  subsistence \naffected APs) \n\n(relocating  and  severely \n\nAssistance for agricultural land located in urban areas \n\nTraining for occupational change \n\nAgricultural extension \n\nSpecial allowance for poor and vulnerable APs \n\nOther measures \n\nEntitlements \n\n \nRent for period of disruption, compensation for loss of crops or trees, \ncompensation  for  loss  of  income  for  period  of  disruption  and  for \nsubsequent crops that cannot be planted, land restored to pre-project \ncondition \nFull title to replacement land as a priority, or cash compensation at full \nreplacement cost at current market value \n\nLivelihood stabilization (income restoration and transition allowances). \n\n \nCompensation  in  cash  or  kind  at  full  replacement  cost  with  no \ndeduction for depreciation or salvaged materials. \nAllowances  for  transportation  of  all  household  effects,  transition \nsubsistence, and bonus payment if AP clears area on time \n\n \n\nCash compensation at market price for loss of crops and fruit \nCompensation determined in consultation with APs based on the type \nand  age  of  the  tree,  to  be  approved  by  the  Department  of  Planning \nand Investment \n\nAPs  relocating  within  province  D3  million  Vietnamese  households \nrelocating to another province D5 million  \nAllowance of 30 kg of rice/person/month for 6 months (or a lump sum \nequivalent to D450,000 per person) \nIn  addition  to  compensation,  cash  assistance  for  agricultural  land  in \nurban, peri-urban, or rural residential areas of between 20\u201350% of the \ncurrent market value of agricultural land. \nTraining  valued  at  up  to  $200  per  AP  will  be  given  directly  to  the \ntraining institution. Trainees entitled to a subsistence allowance during \ntraining will receive $100 per month (for a maximum of 6 months) \nAgricultural  assistance  valued  at  up  to  $110  per  severely  affected \nhousehold  will  be  provided  to  improve  productivity  on  remaining  or \nnew agricultural land through existing government run programs such \nas agricultural extension \nAllowance of 30 kg of rice/person/month for 6 months (or a lump sum \nequivalent to D450,000 per person) \nPriority  for  recruitment  into  work  force  of  contractors  implementing \nproject-financed contracts \n\n AP = affected person; D = dong. \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n5. \nActual  replacement  costs  and  rates  of  compensation  for  loss  are  to  be  determined  in \nconsultation  with  commune  administrations  in  each  subproject  area  during  detailed  design  of \nsubprojects. They will be based on current market rates and detailed measurement surveys. \n \n6. \nEthnic Minorities and Vulnerable Groups. From the social analyses carried out for the \nsix subprojects it was determined that Tra Cau in Quang Ngai Province is a category-A project \nfor which an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) is required. An EMDP is not required for \nthe  other  five  core  projects  because,  with  the  exception  of  the  Thach  Thanh  scheme  in  Than \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4     35  \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nHoa, the subprojects are located in areas with small proportions of ethnic minorities (i.e., 0\u20135%) \nand  the  households  are  dispersed  among  the  Kinh  population.  Detailed  design  of  the  six \nsubprojects will include screening to identify any significant ethnic minority impacts that were not \ndiscerned  during  the  project  preparatory  studies.  If  the  screening  process  shows  that  ethnic \nminority  groups  would  be  at  a  disadvantage  in  the  development  process  or  would  encounter \nconstraints  on  their  ability  to  enjoy  project  benefits,  then  an  EMDP  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the framework given in Appendix 5 to reflect their special needs.6 Similarly, a \nprocess will be established to deal with issues or concerns raised during project implementation. \n \n7. \nIncome  Restoration  Strategy  for  Severely  Affected  Households.  In  addition  to \nproviding  compensation  for  all  lost  assets  at  replacement  cost  to  ensure  that  APs\u2019  livelihoods \nare  not  adversely  affected  (and  where  possible  improved),the  Project  will  identify  severely \naffected persons and provide them with special measures: \n \n \n\npriority for project-related employment opportunities; \ntraining (for 6 months maximum) for all household members who are affected by \nloss of productive income in vocational skills and literacy; \nsubsistence allowance during the training period equivalent to the value of 30 kg \nof rice per month; and \nproductivity enhancement through agricultural extension and related assistance. \n\n \n \nAll  households  that  suffer  a  loss  of  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  assets  or  are \n8. \nrequired to relocate will be provided with additional support. The sites for new residences, home \ngardens, and livestock pens will be cleared and leveled to a satisfactory condition in accordance \nwith  the  wishes  of  the  relocating  families.  Relocating  households  will  be  assisted  to  dismantle \nand rebuild their houses, and those losing agricultural land will be entitled to replacement land \nof equal productivity, or an income restoration and subsistence allowance if there is no land of \nequal productive value available in the commune. The Project will help communes convert non-\nirrigated agricultural land to a suitable condition for irrigation, in consultation with the APs. \n \n9. \nfor  adverse \nresettlement  or  ethnic  minority  impacts  will  continue  during  detailed  design,  and  APs  will  be \nconsulted  to  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  practicable,  their  needs  are  incorporated  into  the  final \ndesign  arrangements.  The  Project  will  also  set  up  a  mechanism  to  deal  with  any  grievances \nraised  during  project  implementation.  APs  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  measurement \nsurveys,  validation  of  compensation  rates  and  entitlements,  and  delivery  of  entitlements, \nmonitoring of impacts and benefits, and design of the grievance mechanism.  \n \n10. \nDisclosure.  Key  information  in  the  resettlement  plans,  including  compensation  and \nrehabilitation options, will be disclosed to the APs before the plans submitted to ADB and MARD \nfor approval. Information disclosed to the APs will be in the form of full or summary resettlement \nplans, or as information booklets and leaflets, and will be in a language that can be understood \nby  the  APs.  Copies  will  be  made  available  for  public  reference  in  an  accessible  place.7  Any \nresettlement  plan  prepared  under  the  Project  will  be  made  freely  available  to  all  affected \npersons  and  other  interested  parties,  in  both  English  and  Vietnamese,  and  will  be  posted  on \nADB\u2019s website following ADB and MARD approval of the related subproject detailed design. \n\nParticipatory  Process  and  Grievance  Mechanism.  Screening \n\n                                                 \n6   Similar attention will be given to identifying and addressing the special needs of any other disadvantaged groups \n\nsuch as the landless, poor, female-headed households, and the disabled. \n\n7   The  relevant  requirements  for  this  are  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (ADB.  2005.  Public \nCommunications Policy: Disclosure and Exchange of Information. Manila), Handbook on Resettlement (ADB. 1998. \nHandbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice.  Manila),  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (ADB.  1998. \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila). \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nC. \n\nResettlement Plans \n\n11. \nFor each subproject area a resettlement plan, including an inventory of lost assets for all \nhouseholds potentially affected by loss of land and structures, was prepared. The resettlement \nplans and related costs will be updated as part of detailed design during project implementation. \nAppropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be set in place as part of the \nresettlement management system. A summary of each subproject is given below. \n \n12. \nThach Thanh Subproject. The subproject is in the mountainous district of Thach Thanh \nnorth  of  Thanh  Hoa  Province.  Project  activities  will  cover  16  communes  scattered  throughout \nthe  district.  The  area  is  densely  populated  and  the  ethnic  minority  community  of  Muong \nconstitutes  58%  of  the  population.  Poverty  is  high:  58%  for  the  district  and  63%  for  the \nsubproject area. Sugarcane is the main crop. Unreliable water supply results in low crop yields \nand low incomes. The subproject will improve irrigation infrastructure to allow double cropping \nalong the Buoi river. It will thereby improve agricultural production and raise incomes and living \nstandards  in  this  poor  district,  especially  among  the  Muong.  Domestic  water  supply  will  be \nprovided  and  this  will  improve  health  and  reduce  the  drudgery  of  women  and  children  who \ncurrently  carry  water  from  sparse  sources.  The  subproject  will  construct  and  rehabilitate \npumping stations, reservoirs, and earth canals (including the provision of lining). The Bai Muong \nweir will be  rehabilitated. The subproject will require land acquisition of 19.2 ha including 13.7 \nha of agricultural land, 4.8 ha of forest land, 0.7 ha of residential land, affecting a total of 1,397 \nhouseholds (1,351 households lose agricultural land, 30 lose residential land, and 16 lose forest \nland).  There  will  also  be  temporary  effects  on  569  households.  Few  structures  are  affected\u2014\none  household  will  lose  its  simple  house,  and  13  households  will  be  affected  by  impacts  on \nsecondary  structures  such  as  animal  pens,  yards,  walls,  and  a  well.  Some  13.5  ha  of  crops \n(predominantly  rice,  sugar  cane,  and  maize)  and  43,255  trees  will  be  cleared.  Some  890 \nhouseholds will lose crops and 53 will lose trees. \n \n13. \nThuong  My  Trung  Subproject.  The  subproject  will  improve  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure for rice in 13 communes within the Kien Giang river basin. Out of a total irrigated \narea  of  4,188  ha,  3,318  ha  are  below  sea  level.  Most  farmers  do  not  plant  a  second  crop \nbecause  of  flood  risk.  Poverty  incidence  is  40\u201360%.  Rice  is  the  main  crop,  while  better-off \nhouseholds  have  diversified  livelihoods  including  livestock  production  and  aquaculture.  The \nsubproject will construct and rehabilitate irrigation, drainage, and flood protection infrastructure \naround Hac Hai lagoon to enable two rice crops on 870 ha above mean sea level, and 3,318 ha \nbelow  sea  level.  Rice  will  be  supplemented  by  aquaculture.  The  main  works  are  (i)  82 \nkilometers  (km)  of  embankment,  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  66  existing  and  construction  of  23  new \nsluice gates, (iii) rehabilitation of 25 existing and construction of 15 new pumping stations, and \n(iv)  related  bridges  and  aqueducts.  The  subproject  will  require  land  acquisition  of  55.2  ha  of \nagricultural land, affecting some 1,382 households (92% of all affected households). There will \nbe  temporary  loss  of  rice  crops  on  65.9  ha  of  land  that  will  be  rented  for  1  year  during \nconstruction,  affecting  1,490  households.  No  main  or  secondary  structures  are  affected.  One \nhousehold will lose 50 trees.  \n \n14. \nThach Han Subproject. The subproject area spreads over 12 communes in Trie Phong \ndistrict,  18  communes  in  Hai  Lang  district,  and  two  urban  wards  in  Quang  Tri  town.  Poverty \nincidence  is  20%  on  average  in  the  province  but  57%  in  the  subproject  area.  The  scheme, \ndesigned in the 1970s, was never completed. Its completion under the Project would allow full \nproduction  on  13,867  ha.  The  works  comprise  (i)  upgrading  the  Thach  Han  headworks  and \ncanal  system  (including  lining  13  km  of  main  canal  and  45  km  of  primary  and  lower-level \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4     37  \n\ncanals);  and  (ii)  construction  of  Ben  Da  weir  to  serve  350  ha.  The  subproject  will  require  land \nacquisition  of  15.2  ha,  including  12.2  ha  of  agricultural  land,  2.9  ha  of  forest  land,  and  1,891 \nsquare meters (m2) of residential land, affecting a total of 471 households (448 households lose \nagricultural  land,  seven  lose  residential  land,  and  16  lose  forest  land).  There  will  also  be \ntemporary  effects  on  467  households  (464  will  experience  short-term  effects  on  9.7  ha  of \nagricultural  land,  the  residential  land  (317  m2)  of  2  will  be  affected,  and  1  will  lose  1.5  ha  of \nforest land, which will be rented for 1 year during construction. There are no primary (houses or \nshops) or secondary (animal pens, walls, rice bins, etc.)  structures affected by the subproject. \nClearance  will  occur  to  11.1  ha  of  crop  (predominantly  rice,  maize,  and  potato)  and  10,729 \ntrees. Some 446 households will lose crops and 10 will lose trees.  \n \n15. \nTay Nam Huong Tra Subproject. The subproject is in the southwestern part of Huong \nTra district, north of Hue city, and includes 4,174 ha of irrigated land (mainly rice). Insufficient \nwater and drainage problems depress rice yields. Poverty incidence is high at 58%. The main \nworks are (i) enlargement of the Khe Ngang reservoir, serving 50 ha; (ii) construction of 8.6 km \nof  a  new  main  canal;  (iii)  raising  the  spillway  of  the  Tho  Son  reservoir  serving  260  ha;  (iv) \nupgrading  the  3-,  5-,  and  7-community  canals;  and  (v)  constructing  a  pumping  station  and \nassociated culverts and sluices at Nam Thanh to improve drainage on 300 ha. The subproject \nwill acquire 93.1 ha, including some 52.8 ha of agricultural land, 38.9 ha of forest land, and 1.4 \nha of residential land, affecting a total of 717 households. There will be temporary loss of 1.7 ha \nof agricultural land (affecting 367 households in three communes) and 46 m2 of residential land \n(affecting  1  household  in  Huong  Toan)  that  will  be  rented  for  1  year  during  construction, \naffecting 1,490 households. Some  structures will be affected\u201436 households  will lose houses \n(and require relocation within the same two communes), and 14 will be affected by impacts on \nsecondary  structures  such  as  animal  pens,  yards,  and  walls.  Some  55.6  ha  of  crop \n(predominantly rice) and 354,520 trees are to be cleared. Some 520 households will lose crops \nand 56 will lose trees. \n \nTra Cau Subproject. The subproject, in Duc Pho and Mo Duc districts in the southern \n16. \npart of the province, comprises the Liet Son-Chop Vung, Nui Ngang, and Dien Truong schemes. \nThe area has poverty levels of 38\u201341%. The social analyses carried out during the preparatory \nstudies determined that there are no ethnic minorities in 12 of the beneficiary communes of the \ndistricts,  but  that  the  directly  affected  persons  in  Ho  Sau  and  Dong  Ram  villages  in  Ba  Kham \ncommune are exclusively of the Hre ethnic group. Tra Cau is a category-A project, for which an \nethnic minority development plan has been prepared.  \n \nThe subproject will enable full agricultural development of the commanded area, provide \n17. \nwater  to  settlements  and  industrial  zones,  and  reduce  poverty.  The  works  include  (i) \nconstruction of the Chop Vung reservoir to serve 700 ha; (ii) heightening the dam and spillway \nof  the  Dien  Truong  reservoir,  and  rehabilitating  and  extending  the  canal  system,  and \nconstructing an access road to the dam; and (iii) completion of primary and lower-level canals in \nthe Nui Ngang system. The subproject will require land acquisition of 107.5 ha, including 38.7 \nha  of  agricultural  land,  67.5  ha  of  forest  land,  1.3  ha  of  residential  land  (1.2  ha  in  Pho  Phong \nalone),  affecting  a  total  of  1,202  households  (861  households  will  lose  agricultural  land,  240 \nforest  land,  97  residential  land,  and  4  aquaculture  land  totaling  114  m2).  There  will  also  be \ntemporary  effects  on  2,963  m2  of  residential  land  belonging  to  56  households,  5.5  ha  of \nagricultural land belonging to 763 households across the five communes, 2.0 ha of forest land in \nthree  communes  (belonging  to  210  households),  and  some  150  m2  of  aquaculture  land \nbelonging to three households. Some 44.0 ha of crops (affecting 1,069 households) and 62,535 \ntrees (affecting 302 households) will be cleared. \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLa  Tinh  Subproject.  The  subproject  area  includes  four  communes  in  Phu  Cat  district \n18. \nand three in Phy My district. The poverty incidence is 45\u201348%. Because irrigation infrastructure \nhas deteriorated, much of which resulted from flood damage, only about 1,800 ha out of a total \ncommand  area  of  3,950  ha  are  currently  supplied  with  water  in  this  scheme.  The  works \ncomprise (i) reconstruction of the Cay Ke weir to serve 1,000 ha, (ii) lining of 80 km of irrigation \ncanal  and  rehabilitation  of  canal  structures,  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  21.5  km  of  flood  protection \nembankments  between  Phu  Ly  bridge  and  Cay  Ke  weir  and  between  La  Tinh  and  Can  River, \nand (iii) rehabilitation of three flood diversion/retention spillways. The subproject will require land \nacquisition of 17.8 ha, including 8.6 ha of agricultural land, 1.0 ha of residential land, 8.0 ha of \nother  land,  and  a  small  area  of  aquaculture  land,  affecting  a  total  of  668  households  (443 \nhouseholds  lose  agricultural  land,  84  lose  residential  land,  137  lose  other  land,  and  4  lose \naquaculture land). There will also be temporary effects on 1.4 ha of residential land belonging to \n121 households, 12.1 ha of agricultural land belonging to 821 households, and some 2,000 m2 \nof  aquaculture  land  belonging  to  seven  households.  Some  22.0  ha  of  crops  (affecting  1,371 \nhouseholds) and 6,188 graves will be cleared. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n       Appendix 5           39  \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND FRAMEWORK \n\n1. \nEthnic minorities are among the poorest and least educated in Viet Nam. Although they \nrepresent only 14% of the population, they make up 29% of Viet Nam\u2019s poor. The incidence of \npoverty  among  ethnic  minorities  is  declining  slowly,  from  86%  in  1993  to  69%  in  2002, \ncompared  with  54%  to  23%  for  the  majority  Kinh.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  housing  and  living  standards \nsurvey  (2000)1  shows  that  the  gap  in  living  standards  between  Kinh  and  ethnic  minorities  has \ngrown.  In  12  of  the  13  poorest  provinces  (those  where  more  than  60%  of  the  population  are \nbelow the poverty line) ethnic minorities represent at least half the population. Expenditure per \ncapita  among  ethnic  minority  households  is  13%  lower  than  for  Kinh  households.  The \neducational  attainment  of  household  heads  and  spouses  is  lower,  too,  and  endowments  in \nterms of housing and other assets are below average as well.  \n \nEthnic minorities suffer from several interrelated causes of poverty such as geographic, \n2. \nsocial, and intellectual isolation; inadequate productive resources caused by lack of labor, land, \ncapital,  or  skills;  excessive  health  risks  brought  on  by  food  inadequacy  caused  by  poor  crop \nproductivity,  disease,  and  unwanted  births,  among  other  factors;  inadequate  participation  in \nplanning  and  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  relevant  programs;  and  environmental \ndegradation.2 The compounded effect of these characteristics is such that minority households \nare  substantially  poorer  than  the  Kinh,  although  it  is  important  to  note  in  terms  of  focusing \ngovernment interventions that not all ethnic minority groups are equally disadvantaged.3  \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Policy Towards Ethnic Minorities  \n\n3. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  1992  Constitution  recognizes  ethnic  minorities  as  vulnerable  groups  and \nsupports the provision of special assistance to bring development benefits to them. A ministerial \nlevel agency was created in 1959 to address ethnic minority development. It was supplanted in \n1994  by  the  Committee  for  Ethnic  Minorities  and  Mountainous  Areas  (CEMMA)  which \ncoordinates and monitors ethnic minority development activities.  \n \n4. \nThe  Government  aims  to  integrate  ethnic  minority  groups  into  Vietnamese  society  and \npromote their greater participation in mainstream economic life by addressing inequities of both \ndevelopment  and  infrastructure  provision,  particularly  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas. \nInvestments  in  specific  projects  are  underpinned  by  country-wide  poverty  reduction  programs \nthat provide direct assistance to poor households and communes. The Hunger Eradication and \nPoverty Reduction (HEPR) and Program 135, both initiated in 1998, cover a range of benefits \nfrom  exemption  of  fees  and  taxes  (under  HEPR)  to  the  provision  of  grants  for  small \ninfrastructure (under Program 135). Most of these initiatives come under CEMMA.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Vietnam  General  Statistical  Office.  2000.

World Bank, Washington. Policy Research Working Paper. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People \n\nADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  people4  (IPP)  focuses  on  the  circumstances  of  indigenous \n5. \npeople  and  on  measures  to  identify  and  satisfy  their  needs  and  development  aspirations.  The \nIPP  emphasizes  participation  of  ethnic  minority  groups  in  development  and  mitigation  of \nnegative  effects  or  impacts  on  particular  groups  by  virtue  of  their  culture  and  traditions.  All \nprojects and programs funded by ADB must comply with the various requirements of the IPP as \nwell  as  section  F3/BP  (May  2004)  of  the  Operations  Manual.  Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  are \nconsidered significant if they positively or negatively (i) affect their customary rights of use and \naccess  to  land  and  natural  resources;  (ii)  change  their  socio-economic  status;  (iii)  affect  their \ncultural  and  communal  integrity;  (iv)  affect  their  health,  education,  livelihood  and/or  social \nsecurity  status;  or  (v)  alter  or  undermine  the  recognition  of  indigenous  knowledge.  The  IPP \nrequires that a social analysis be undertaken to determine the likely scope of any such effects \nand that each project be categorized according to the level of planning required.  \n \nThe  IPP  requires  preparation  of  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)5  for \n6. \nprojects  likely  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous  communities.  The  EMDP  ascertains  the \nvulnerability of the indigenous community to the particular project, ensures that the community \nis given equal opportunity to benefit from and participate in the project, and specifies strategies \nand  measures  to  avoid  negative  impacts.  Where  such  impacts  cannot  be  avoided,  adequate \nand appropriate compensation must be provided.  \n \nD. \n\nEthnic Minorities in the Project Area \n\nto \n\nfrom  highland \n\nThe Project will improve irrigation management and rehabilitate and complete irrigation \n7. \nand drainage infrastructure in six coastal provinces in central Viet Nam. It is compatible with the \nsocial  and  economic  institutions  of  the  communities  in  the  project  area  and,  apart  from \nresettlement effects, which will be mitigated by measures defined in resettlement plans for the \nsix  subprojects,  will  not  have  any  significant  negative  effects.  This  is  largely  because  ethnic \nminority communities in the project area have already adopted the social and cultural institutions \nof  national  society,  including  sending  their  children  to  school  and  using  the  Kinh  language.  In \nrecent  years,  they  have  also  been  the  subject  of  Government  initiatives  that  encouraged \nlowland  areas.  Nevertheless,  ethnic  minority  groups  are \nrelocation \ndisadvantaged  in  many  ways  when  trying  to  establish  livelihoods  in  the  \u201cmainstream\u201d  and \npredominantly Kinh culture.  \n \nDuring  the  preparatory  studies,  the  social  analyses  carried  out  for  the  six  subprojects \n8. \n(one in each target province) determined that Tra Cau in Quang Ngai Province is a category-A \nproject for which an EMDP is required.6 An EMDP is not required for the other five core projects \nbecause, with the exception of the Thach Thanh scheme in Than Hoa (see also para. 19), the \nsubprojects are located in areas with small proportions of ethnic minorities (i.e., 0\u20135%) and the \nhouseholds are dispersed among the Kinh population.  \n \n9. \nThe  subproject,  in  Duc  Pho  and  Mo  Duc  districts  in  the  southern  part  of  the  province, \ncomprises the Liet Son-Chop Vung, Nui Ngang, and Dien Truong schemes. There are no ethnic \n\n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila \n5   An  EMDP  relates  to  a  community  and  is  not  prepared  in  cases  where  the  affected  persons  represent  a  small \nminority  of  households  in  the  community,  or  where  the  ethnic  minority  households  are  intermixed  with  Kinh \nhouseholds  and  do  not  maintain  a  separate  or  unique  identity  within  the  community.  In  such  cases,  the  ethnic \nminority beneficiaries or affected persons are covered by other project measures such as the gender action plan.  \n\n6   A detailed EMDP was prepared for Tra Cau subproject and is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n\f \n\n       Appendix 5           41  \n\nminorities in 12 of the beneficiary communes of Duc Pho and Mo Duc districts, but the directly \naffected  people  (APs)  in  the  villages  of  Ho  Sau  and  Dong  Ram  in  Ba  Kham  commune  are \nexclusively of the Hre ethnic group. Resettlement planning in the Tra Cau subproject surveyed \nall of the affected Hre households. This showed that the Hre are significantly worse off than the \nKinh in terms of education, literacy, and basic skills.7 Further, they are significantly poorer than \nthe  Kinh  and  more  likely  to  be  engaged  in  subsistence  agriculture  as  their  sole  means  of \nlivelihood.  \n \nIn  the  project-affected  villages,  39%  of  households  have  4-5  members,  while  a  third \n10. \nhave  2\u20133  members,  and  13%  have  more  than  six  members.  About  8%  of  households  have \nmore than seven members (the largest being 12). Hre households are larger than those of the \nKinh  (one  third  of  Hre  households  have  seven  or  more  members  compared  with  9%  of  Kinh \nhouseholds).  Hre  heads  of  household  are  younger  than  their  Kinh  equivalents\u2014about  44%  of \nHre  household  heads  are  between  20\u201330  years  old  compared  with  6%  of  Kinh  household \nheads\u2014and fewer are 60 or older (17% compared with 25%). All household heads stated that \ntheir  main  source  of  livelihood  is  agriculture,  but  two  thirds  of  Kinh  households  also  raise \nlivestock.  All  Kinh  households  and  97%  of  Hre  households  have  land-use  right  certificates \n(LURCs)  for  their  residential,  garden,  and  agricultural  land.  Only  13%  of  households  have \nLURCs for forest land, with none of these in the name of a female head of household. Female-\nheaded households make up 13% of Hre and 22% of Kinh households. Male household heads, \nregardless of ethnicity, are significantly better educated than female household heads (35% of \nfemale  household  heads  compared  with  20%  of  male  household  heads  have  no  formal \neducation). No Hre female household heads had higher than primary education.  \n \nIn the subproject area, average per capita annual income is D2.7 million with a minimum \n11. \nof  D438,000  and  a  maximum  of  D19.9  million.  Disaggregation  by  ethnicity  shows  that  59%  of \nHre  households  compared  with  47%  of  Kinh  households  have  two  sources  of  income,  while \n18% of Kinh households compared with 9% of Hre households have three sources of income. \nFemale-headed  households  have  fewer  income  sources  than  male-headed  households.  Up  to \n58%  of  households  fall  below  the  poverty  line,  with  13%  in  transitional,  20%  in  non-poor,  and \n9% in wealthy categories.  \n \nE. \n\nSummary Ethnic Minority Development Plan for the Tra Cau Subproject \n\n12. \nThe resettlement plan will mitigate the most significant adverse impacts of the Tra Cau \nsubproject.  In  addition,  all  households  will  be  covered  by  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  which \nwill  target  women  to  improve  their  participation  in  project  activities  and  their  access  to  project \nbenefits. The EMDP will ensure that Hre households in Ho Sau and Dong Ram villages in Ba \nKham commune benefit equitably from project interventions.  \n \nThe EMDP components have been determined through consultations with the commune \n13. \nand  the  two  affected  villages.  Affected  households  requested  project  assistance  for  improving \nliteracy and other skills (such as health awareness) through community education, and provision \nof  agricultural  extension  and  training  to  improve  the  productivity  of  agriculture.8  They  also \nrequested  assistance  to  identify  new  crops  and  products  as  a  means  of  diversifying  their \nsources of income. The EMDP covers the two participating villages and includes (i) training of \nmale and female adults aged 15\u201340 in literacy, numeracy, health and nutrition, livestock raising, \n\n                                                 \n7   No  Hre  household  heads  have  an  upper-secondary  education,  only  4%  have  a  lower-secondary  education,  and \n\n53% of Hre household heads are without any formal education (compared with 2% for Kinh households). \n\n8   Agricultural extension will be provided under the resettlement plan and the gender action plan. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\naccessing existing sources of  credit, small  business accounting and managing, and marketing \n(supported  by  the  provision  of  a  small  library  of  books);  and  (ii)  extension  of  the  transition \nsubsistence for relocating households. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  training  is  to  enhance  the  Hre\u2019s  livelihood  opportunities  by \n14. \ndeveloping basic literacy and numeracy skills, building confidence and self reliance, improving \nfamily health, creating opportunities for new livelihood activities, and fostering the development \nof natural leadership and managerial capacity within the community. The training courses will be \nimplemented  by  the  provincial  and  district  Vietnam  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU)9  which  will  work  in \ncollaboration  with  district  health  care  and  department  of  agriculture  and  rural  development \nagricultural extension staff. \n \nThe  EMDP\u2019s  basic  elements  will  be  reviewed  and  elaborated  during  detailed  design  of \n15. \nthe  Tra  Cau  scheme  by  the  Quang  Ngai  provincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  with  the \nassistance  of  project-financed  consultants.  The  EMDP  will  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and ADB. The PPMU will liaise with the \nprovincial  and  district  women\u2019s  unions  to  implement  the  EMDP  and  will  ensure  that  funds  are \navailable  as  needed.  The  EMDP\u2019s  overall  cost  estimate  is  about  $36,000  (including  a  10% \ncontingency). EMDP implementation will be monitored and reported upon as part of subproject \nperformance monitoring. \n \nF. \n\nSummary Ethnic Minority Development Framework \n\n16. \nDetailed  design  of  the  six  subprojects  will  include  screening  to  identify  any  significant \nethnic  minority  impacts  that  were  not  discerned  during  the  project  preparatory  studies.  If  the \nscreening  process  shows  that  ethnic  minority  groups  will  be  at  a  disadvantage  in  the \ndevelopment process or will encounter constraints on their ability to enjoy project benefits, then \nan  EMDP  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  this  framework  to  reflect  their  special  needs.10 \nSimilarly,  a  process  will  be  established  to  deal  with  issues  or  concerns  raised  during  project \nimplementation. This summary ethnic minority development framework11 has been prepared to \nguide the preparation and implementation of any EMDP that may be required for subprojects.  \n \nParticular attention will be given, for example, to the Thach Thanh scheme in Than Hoa \n17. \nwhere the Muong constitute 58% of the population. The social analysis found that most of the \nscheme\u2019s  145  villages  (62%)  are  mixed  Kinh  and  Muong.  It  noted  that  the  two  communities \nhave  lived  together  for  some  200  years  and  that  the  Muong  no  longer  retain  a  unique  or \nculturally separate identity, way of life, language, or style of dress.12 \n \n18. \n \n\nThe basic principles are the following: \n(i) \n\nAdverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minority  communities,  as  distinct  and  vulnerable \ngroups, should be avoided or minimized by exploring all viable options. \nEthnic  minorities  and  any  other  persons  directly  affected  by  a  subproject  are \nentitled to compensation for lost and affected assets, incomes, and businesses at \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9   VWU is a mass organization comprising a comprehensive district and village network. \n10  Similar attention will be given to identifying and addressing the special needs of any other disadvantaged groups \n\nsuch as the landless, poor, female-headed households, and the disabled. \n\n11  A more detailed EMDF is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n12  Where  ethnic  minority  and  non-ethnic  minority  groups  live  in  the  same  project  location,  the  IPP  only  requires  an \n\naction plan or program to account for any specific needs. \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(vi) \n\n \n\n       Appendix 5           43  \n\nreplacement cost and are to be provided with rehabilitation measures13 sufficient \nto  help  them  improve  or  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  living  standards, \nincomes and productive capacity. \nLack of legal rights to assets (including traditional hunting or fishing grounds and \ncommunity resources) will not bar the APs from entitlement to compensation and \nrehabilitation  measures  in  the  event  of  loss  of  or  adverse  affects  upon  such \nassets.14 \nIn  cases  requiring  relocation  or  displacement  of  ethnic  minority  households, \nefforts shall be made to maintain, to the extent possible, the existing social and \ncultural  institutions  of  the  people  being  resettled,  as  well  as  those  of  the  host \ncommunity and community from which the ethnic minority households have been \nmoved. \nAny  required  EMDPs  are  to  be  prepared  and  implemented  with  the  full \nparticipation of and in consultation with ethnic minorities. \nThe  implementation  schedule  and  budget  for  the  subproject  are  to  be  made \ncompatible with and adequate for the EMDP (including all necessary participatory \nmechanisms and surveys during the preparation phase). \nEthnic  minorities,  female-headed  households,  and  families  with  disabled  or \nelderly  persons  are  to  be  compensated  in  a  way  that  respects  their  cultural \nvalues and specific needs. \n\n \n19. \n \n\nAny new EMDP will include \n(i) \n\na  brief  description  of  the  subproject  and  likely  scope  of  its  impacts  on  ethnic \nminority communities; \npolicy and legal framework of Government and ADB in respect of ethnic minority \ndevelopment;  \nethnic minority development principles to be applied to all subprojects under the \nProject;  \nprocedures to be followed for implementation of the EMDP; and  \nadministrative  and  financing  arrangements  for  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nevaluating the EMDP.  \n\n \nKey information in the EMDP will be disclosed to the APs before the EMDP is submitted \n20. \nto  ADB  and  MARD  for  approval.  Information  disclosed  to  the  APs  will  be  in  the  form  of  full  or \nsummary EMDP, or as information booklets and leaflets, and will be in a language that can be \nunderstood  by  the  APs.  Copies  will  be  made  available  for  public  reference  in  an  accessible \nplace.15 Any EMDP prepared under the Project will be made freely available to all APs and other \ninterested  parties,  in  English  and  Vietnamese,  and  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  following \nADB and MARD approval of the related subproject detailed design. \n\n                                                 \n13  Where  people  are  significantly  affected  by  the  loss  of  assets,  incomes,  and  jobs,  compensation  solely  for  lost \nassets may not be adequate to restore their economic and social base. Such people will be entitled to rehabilitation \nassistance for restoring incomes and living standards. \n\n14  People  without legal rights  are referred to  as non-titled  in the Operations  Manual Section F2/BP (October 2003), \nand include those who have no recognizable rights or claims to the land that they are occupying and/or using. The \npolicy  also  states  that  restoration  measures  must  be  determined  in  consultation  with  affected  communities, \nincluding those people who might not be formally recognized in national legislation. \n\n15  The  relevant  requirements  for  this  are  set  out  in  ADB.  2005.

Nearly 80% of poor \nhouseholds are engaged in agriculture as their primary occupation. The sector is therefore important for development \nof irrigated agriculture to improve food security, income generation, job creation, and general quality of life in rural \nareas. The sector accounts for 20% of gross domestic product, 73% of the labor force, and 30% of the country's \nexports. The central region\u2014where the Project is located\u2014has 29% of the country\u2019s population and about 38% of the \ncountry\u2019s poor. Viet Nam was the first signatory to ADB\u2019s rural water and poverty action initiative. The Project is one \nof several aimed at addressing the multiple dimensions of poverty and development in the central region. \n\n \nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe poverty classification of the Project is targeted intervention. The Project comprises a number of elements that will \nhave direct benefits for the poor: \n \nA social and poverty assessment was carried out for each of the subprojects in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations (1993). It included an assessment of the incidence of poverty \nwhich revealed the nature and perceptions of its causes: (i) lack of access to functioning irrigation and drainage, (ii) \nlow level of education, (iii) landlessness, (iv) poor access to market centers and social services, (v) lack of access to \nlow interest credit, (vi) surplus labor within the households and chronic unemployment or underemployment \nespecially among the young, (vii) gender-related factors, and (viii) poor health, especially caused by waterborne \ndiseases and malaria. \n \nThe social analysis identified specific groups within the population who are particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged \nand unable to benefit fully from project interventions without some social preparation. There are significant numbers \nof poor landless households, many of them headed by women, and a high percentage of children living in poor \nhouseholds, many of whom have health problems related to Agent Orange. It also identified pockets of large \nnumbers of pensioners and disability support recipients, as well as some ethnic minorities. \n \nUsing  the  poverty  line  of  D1.8  million/person/year  established  through  poverty  mapping  (2003),  poverty  incidence \nranges from  35%  in the Quang  Ngai  project area to  63%  in Thanh Hoa. Improvements in irrigation  and  agricultural \nproduction  are  key  steps  in  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  includes  interventions  to  specifically  target  the  poor  and \nvulnerable and thereby enhance the poverty reduction impact.  \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n No \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n Yes  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nStakeholders,  beneficiaries  and  directly  affected  people  have  been  consulted  and  will  continue  to  be  so  during \nsubproject design and implementation. A participatory and consultative methodology  was adopted to undertake the \nsocial  analysis  during  the  feasibility  study.  It  involved  (i)  initial  field  reconnaissance  discussions  with  project \nstakeholders; (ii) group interviews in 80% of communes; (iii) detailed survey questionnaires of beneficiary households \nand  surveys  of  households  directly  affected  by  land  acquisition;  (iv)  a  series  of  stakeholder  workshops  in  the  six \nsubprojects; (v) interviews with key government staff, nongovernment organizations, and other funding agencies; (vi) \ninterviews with ethnic minorities; and (vii) interviews with women. \n \nDuring project implementation the participation of stakeholders will be further supported and deepened with the \nassistance of a team of community facilitators. This will ensure close linkages are established between the project \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nimplementation team and the community. It will facilitate a participatory approach to detailed design of the irrigation \nworks through formation of water user groups and arranging farmer walk-throughs to finalize alignments in \naccordance with the groups\u2019 preferences. The institutional capacity of the groups will subsequently be developed to \nfacilitate sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of the system. The community facilitators will also be \nresponsible for identifying and assisting disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes, included in resettlement, ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), gender \naction plan (GAP), HIV/AIDS awareness program, and participatory development activities. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe social analysis confirmed that the burden of work and poverty in the project area is disproportionately borne by \nwomen; from 12% (Tay Nam Huong Tra\u2013Hue) to 48% (La Tinh\u2013Binh Dinh) of the households are headed by women. \nThese women are widowed, abandoned, or left alone for long periods because of male seasonal migration. A number \nof single elderly women live alone on their farms. Compared to male-headed households, these female-headed \nhouseholds have a lower level of education; inadequate adult labor; limited access to land, credit, and agricultural \nextensions; and in a number of cases lower incomes. A high proportion fall below the poverty line. A GAP has been \nprepared and will be implemented to address these issues. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE. \n  \nItem \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n \nSix resettlement plans prepared in accordance with ADB's \nand the Government's policies and guidelines.

Greater participation of farmers in O&M \nwill  reduce  costs,  and  could  provide  some  additional \nincome for poor farmers. \n \nPriority will be given to poor households for unskilled and \nsemiskilled  activities  in  project  implementation.  Contract \ndocuments  will  be  made  up  in  compliance  with  the \ncountry's  labor  legislation  (e.g.,  minimum  wages,  safe \nworking conditions)  \n \nEthnic minority groups are present in the project area, and \nethnic  considerations  are  significant  in  one  subproject \narea. A framework has been included for the case where \nany  additional  EMDP  is  required.  Cultural  impact  issues \nwill  be  addressed  in  the  EMDP,  GAP,  and  resettlement \nplans. \n \nTargeted  support  to  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  will  be \nprovided  in  the  GAP  and  training  programs.

The financial analysis examined the sustainability of the \nproposed  irrigation  from  the  farmers\u2019  point  of  view;  economic  analysis  determined  the \nincremental benefits, including increased primary sector production, domestic water supply, and \nflood  protection.  The  economic  analysis  was  disaggregated  to  demonstrate  the  returns  to \ninvestment  from  (i)  irrigation  infrastructure  improvements  and  (ii)  institutional  strengthening  of \nirrigation  service  providers\u2014irrigation  management  companies  (IMCs).  The \ninstitutional \nstrengthening addresses risks associated with inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of \ninfrastructure.  While  the  institutional  strengthening  is  assessed  against  the  project  impacts, \nsignificant  positive  externalities  will  be  generated  from  the  impact  of  these  reforms  on  the  full \ncommand areas of irrigation schemes under the IMC\u2019s control.  \n \nB. \n\nMajor Assumptions \n\n2. \nThe Project has an implementation period of 6 years and an assumed economic life of \n30  years  with  no  residual  value.  For  the  analysis  the  interbank  exchange  rate  of  D15,800  per \ndollar  at  the  time  of  the  appraisal  has  been  used.  A  discount  rate  of  12%  has  been  used  to \nascertain the net present value (NPV) and also as the hurdle rate for the economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR). \n \nFinancial  costs  and  benefits  are  estimated  in  constant  mid-2003  terms.  Technical  and \n3. \nfinancial coefficients are based on the findings of the field surveys during the feasibility study in \n2004,  and  were  adjusted  for  the  economic  analysis  to  2005  terms  during  loan  appraisal.  The \nanalysis uses a world price numeraire, where economic prices for traded outputs and inputs are \nbased  on  the  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections.  Prices  for  rice  paddy,  maize,  shrimp, \nand phosphatic and potassic fertilizers are estimated at import parity (Supplementary Appendix \nE). All other inputs and outputs have been valued at competitive market prices, after adjusting \nfor taxes, duties, and an implicit overvaluation of the exchange rate. Electricity used in pumping \nhas been valuated at its long-run marginal cost of supply. A conversion factor of 0.9 has been \nused  to  express  civil  works  in  efficiency  terms.  In  the  case  of  unskilled  labor,  a  shadow  wage \nrate factor of 0.6 has been used to express the wages in terms of opportunity costs. For semi-\nskilled  labor  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.7  has  been  used.  Domestic  prices  of  non-traded \ngoods  and  services  have  been  converted  to  their  economic  equivalent  by  multiplying  their \nfinancial prices by a standard conversion factor of 0.9. \n \n4. \nCrop  models  were  prepared  using  the  FARMOD  software  for  a  range  of  farm  sizes \nwithin each of the schemes, based on expected yield, cropping intensity, and cropping patterns. \nFor the financial analysis, only hired labor has been costed while for the economic analysis both \nfamily and hired labor have been included (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nC. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n5. \nBenefit  Area  and  Households.  The  Project  will  establish  a  service-oriented  approach \nto  irrigation  water  management  where  provincial  agencies  and  the  water  users  will  be \nempowered  to  jointly  manage  irrigation  schemes  within  the  six  project  provinces.  This  will  be \ndone  by  (i)  restructuring  the  IMCs  as  financially  autonomous  entities,  and  forming  water  user \ngroups (WUGs) and associations (WUAs) to participate fully in irrigation management; and (ii) \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nconstructing  and  rehabilitating  water  management  infrastructure  in  each  subproject  area. \nNatural  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  will  complement  the  physical  improvements.  The \nscope of institutional reform and strengthening will be determined through a business planning \nprocess  that  will  define  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  moving  the  management  of  irrigation \nschemes  onto  a  more  viable  basis.  The  six  irrigation  subprojects  involve  a  total  of  33,636 \nhectares  (ha)  of  command  area  associated  with  about  400,500  beneficiaries.  The  cropping \nintensity  is  predicted  to  increase  from  155%  to  172%  across  the  total  project  as  the  cropped \narea increases from 52,432 ha to 57,755 ha. Table A11.1 summarizes the project coverage in \nterms of command areas, cropping areas, and beneficiaries. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Project Beneficiary Population, Cropping and Command Area \n\nItems \n\nUnit \n\nTotal \n\nThach Han \n\nTra Cau  La Tinh \n\nThach \nThanh \n\nThuong \nMy Trung \n\nTay Nam \nHuong Tra \n\nperson  400,484  39,190 \nBeneficiaries \n3,782 \n33,636 \nCommand area \nha \n5,512 \n52,432 \nCropped area without project  ha \n6,272 \n57,755 \nha \nCropped area with project \n\n44,336 \n4,188 \n5,549 \n8,376 \n\n136,017 \n14,078 \n22,725 \n23,617 \n\n50,269 \n3,176 \n3,122 \n3,167 \n\n94,639 \n5,001 \n8,217 \n7,718 \n\n36,034 \n3,411 \n7,307 \n8,605 \n\nha = hectare. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nQuantified  Benefits.  With  the  project,  the  main  agricultural  benefits  arise  from \n6. \nincreased  cropping  intensities  and  improved  dry  season  rice  yields.  Average  yields  for  each \nsubproject  are  currently  lower  than  those  of  the  provinces,  mainly  because  of  inadequate  or \npoorly  timed  water,  especially  at  the  tertiary  level  of  the  command  area  and  during  the  dry \nseason.  Poor  infrastructure  is  a  major  constraint.  Crop  yields  are  lower  than  the  average  for \nwell-irrigated  systems  in  the  region,  and  it  is  anticipated  that  improvements  to  infrastructure, \nirrigation  management,  and  crop  husbandry  will  provide  yield  increases  of  10\u201315%  from \nirrigated crops. Currently non-irrigated areas that  are to be converted to irrigation  will produce \n50% more than those figures.  \n \nWithout the project, IMCs will continue to under invest in O&M of the schemes leading to \n7. \ndeclining  command  areas, \nIn  such \ncircumstances  it  is  predicted  the  irrigated  area  will  decline  by  0\u201350%,  depending  on  the \ncondition of existing infrastructure and the capability of the management provider.

A total of 3,200 ha of rice/fish production system is predicted to develop \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11       55  \n\nin  the  Thuong  My  Trung  scheme  along  with  expanded  intensive  shrimp  production  in  Thach \nHan, Tra Cau, and La Tinh subproject areas. \n \n9. \nTable  3  shows  the  relative  importance  of  the  predicted  incremental  outputs  of  rice, \nsugarcane,  and  shrimp.  The  markets  for  rice  are  driven  by  the  continued  expansion  of  rice \nexports  from  Viet  Nam,  and  the  increased  production  is  not  expected  to  impact  on  local \nmarkets. Shrimp production from intensive pond systems also targets the export market and will \nbe  linked  to  existing  value  and  export  chains.  Increased  sugarcane  production  targets  surplus \ncapacity in local mills, but its impact is not clearly understood.  \n \n\nTable A11.3: Estimated Incremental Output by Province (tons) \n\nCommodity \n\nIncremental \nOutput \n(tons) \n\nThanh \nHoa \n\nQuang \nBinh \n\nQuang \nTri \n\nThua \nThien \nHue \n\nQuang \nNgai \n\nBinh \nDinh \n\n5,813 \n1,817 \n52,220 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n12,813 \n0 \n0 \n(901) \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n3,288 \n0 \n\n10,406 \n1,411 \n3,685 \n(216) \n0 \n988 \n(1,860) \n0 \n0 \n1,440 \n\n20,700 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n4,438 \n1,213 \n(9,570) \n0 \n0 \n160 \n\n5,638 \n0 \n0 \n(1,050) \n0 \n2,935 \n(2,159) \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n54,574 \n3,227 \n126,485 \n(2,167) \n4,438 \n5,817 \n(28,757) \n693 \n3,288 \n3,160 \n\n(796) \n0 \n70,580 \n0 \n0 \n681 \n(15,168) \n693 \n0 \n1,560 \n\nRice \nMaize \nSugarcane \nSweet Potato \nHot Pepper \nGroundnut \nCassava \nCotton cum groundnut \nAquaculture \nShrimp \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n10. \nAbout  80,000  households  will  benefit  directly  from  the  Project  in  the  form  of  increased \noutput  of  agricultural  products  because  of  (i)  higher  cropping  intensities  (especially  in  areas \ncurrently  under  rain-fed  cultivation),  (ii)  higher  yields  because  of  wider  use  of  high  yielding \nvarieties,  (iii)  stable  and  full  irrigation  water  supply,  and  (iv)  incremental  output  of  shrimp  and \nfish.  The  main  crops  cultivated  in  the  subproject  area  are  paddy,  sugarcane,  groundnut  and \nmaize. Implementation of the six subprojects would increase the cultivated area from 52,432 ha \nwithout the Project to 57,755 ha with the Project. Fish are raised in over 3,000 ha of rice fields \nduring summer and autumn in Thuong My Trung (Quang Binh). Shrimp are raised in (i) Tra Cau \n(Quang Ngai) on 450 ha in the winter and spring and on 300 ha in the summer and autumn, (ii) \nLa Tinh (Binh Dinh) on 300 ha in the winter and spring and in the summer and autumn, and (iii) \nThach Han (Quang Tri) on 200 ha. \n \n11. \nNon-Production Benefits. Two subprojects have flood control components that mitigate \nthe  influence  of  floods  for  the  command  area.  The  Tay  Nam  Huong  Tra  subproject  will  shift \nareas currently irrigated by pumping to gravity irrigation resulting in saved power costs valued at \nD277  million  per  year  in  2004  terms.  Most  subprojects  provide  improved  domestic  water \nsources that reduce the burden and cost of collecting water from sometimes remote sources.  \n \n12. \nNon-Quantified Benefits. Apart from cost savings and production benefits, there are a \nnumber  of  non-quantified  benefits,  including  (i)  improved  integration  of  farm  planning  and \nirrigation  water  management,  (ii)  improved  efficiency  arising  from  the  introduction  and \nempowerment of WUGs/WUAs, (iii) reduced costs and improved quality of operations provided \nby  IMCs,  and  (iv)  improved  service  provision  leading  to  higher  revenues  and  greater  financial \nsustainability of all irrigation schemes managed by participating IMCs.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n13.  Most  non-quantified  benefits  derive  from  institutional  improvements  that  are  critically \nneeded  to  sustain  the  quantified  benefits.  For  example,  the  creation  and  capacity  building  of \nWUGs provide significant productivity and cost-efficiency benefits that have been demonstrated \nin  earlier  technical  assistance,  including  reduced  water  use,  higher  yields,  lower  management \ncosts, and less conflict over water. The full set of benefits includes empowered water users that \nlink  closely  with  management  service  providers  through  greater  transparency  and  a  better \ninformed constituency during project implementation.  \n \nD. \n\nAssessment of Financial Returns to Irrigators \n\n14 \nThe  effect  of  the  proposed  investment  on  farm  households  was  assessed  in  financial \nterms  from  the  farmer\u2019s  perspective.  Representative  farm  models  for  differing  land  use  types \nand  farm  sizes  were  developed.  The  parameters  for  the  farm  models  are  based  on  the \ninformation  obtained  from  a  survey  of  farmers  and  public  consultation  meetings  conducted  for \nthe  feasibility  study.  Typical  farms  are  small,  average,  and  large  and  would  be  represented  in \nagro-ecosystems as either (i) lowland dominated by paddy or (ii) highland dominated by upland \ncrops. Crop input and output parameters (yields, fertilizer rates, labor, etc.) are combined with \nfinancial prices collected during surveys and field investigations.  \n \n15. \nFarm  models  were  generated  using  FARMOD  for  both  the  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  and  \u201cwith \nproject\u201d scenarios and are based on current and anticipated cropping patterns and crop budgets \nfor the subprojects. The farm model analysis was conducted for a project period of 20 years and \nis summarized in Table A11.4.  \n \nThe  farm  analysis  includes  the  development  of  on-farm  irrigation  facilities  and  field \n16. \nchannels, with exception of the Tay Nam Huong Tra subproject where no on-farm development \nis required. One family labor is assumed to be available for most agricultural activities for small \nand medium-sized farms, while for the large farm model two family laborers are assumed to be \navailable.  \n \n17. \nFarm  household  benefits  assessed  in  the  incremental  return  to  family  labor  is \nsignificantly positive with increases ranging from 126\u2013179% for large farms and from 188\u2013227% \nfor small farmers (Table A11.5).  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11       57  \n\nTable A11.4: Summary of the Farm Model Analysis \n\nNo \n  \n\n \n  \n\nFarm \nsize \n(ha) \n\nCropping \nintensity (%) \n\nFarm benefits after \nfinancing (1000 D) \n\nReturn to family \nlabor (1000 D) \n\nP/FWO \n\nFW \n\nP/FWO \n\nFW \n\nP/FWO \n\nFW \n\nIncremental \nreturn/day \nfamily labor \n\n1  Thach Thanh / Paddy farm \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,399 \n4,502 \n \n1,205 \n3,350 \n \n1,371 \n7,787 \n \n1,454 \n6,217 \n \n2,126 \n9,507 \n \n1,677 \n7,295 \n \n1,276 \n6,047 \n \n572 \n2,799 \n \n1,655 \n8,553 \n \n1,173 \n4,867 \n \n1,740 \n9,198 \n \n1,313 \n5,882 \n\n3,134 \n9,246 \n \n2,542 \n7,808 \n \n2,707 \n12,337 \n \n4,192 \n19,562 \n \n2,857 \n13,483 \n \n2,628 \n11,505 \n \n2,408 \n11,040 \n \n1,982 \n9,667 \n \n2,564 \n12,018 \n \n1,921 \n8,607 \n \n2,963 \n14,813 \n \n2,783 \n13,640 \n\n15 \n21 \n \n19 \n19 \n \n34 \n47 \n \n36 \n38 \n \n60 \n60 \n \n42 \n35 \n \n33 \n37 \n \n21 \n21 \n \n45 \n53 \n \n26 \n28 \n \n41 \n43 \n \n28 \n29 \n\n34 \n37 \n \n41 \n45 \n \n62 \n77 \n \n72 \n89 \n \n71 \n84 \n \n61 \n58 \n \n54 \n64 \n \n38 \n41 \n \n58 \n67 \n \n43 \n49 \n \n62 \n65 \n \n46 \n52 \n\n - \n119 \n \n - \n - \n \n393 \n - \n \n156 \n237 \n \n162 \n9,941 \n \n366 \n - \n \n184 \n520 \n \n58 \n67 \n \n121 \n192 \n \n - \n - \n \n204 \n369 \n \n107 \n126 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.3 \n1.0 \n\n Small \n Large \nThach Thanh / Upland farm \n Small \n Large \n\n0.3 \n1.0 \n\n200 \n150 \n\n100 \n100 \n\n2  Thuong My Trung / Paddy farm \n\n0.2 \n1.0 \n\n Small \n Large \nThuong My Trung / Paddy-fish farm \n Small \n Large \n\n175 \n180 \n\n175 \n180 \n\n0.2 \n1.0 \n\n3  Thach Han / Paddy farm \n\n0.2 \n1.0 \n\n0.2 \n1.0 \n\n175 \n180 \n\n Small \n Large \nThach Han / Upland farm \n Small \n Large farm \n\n175 \n180 \n4  Tay Nam Huong Tra / Paddy farm \n175 \n180 \n\n Small \n Large \nTay Nam Huong Tra / Upland farm \n Small \n Large  \n\n100 \n100 \n\n0.2 \n1.0 \n\n0.2 \n1.0 \n\n5  Tra Cau / Paddy farm \n\n0.2 \n Small \n1.0 \n Large \nTra Cau / Upland farm \n0.2 \n Small \n1.0 \n Large \n\n6  La Tinh / Paddy farm \n\n0.2 \n Small \n Large \n1.0 \nLa Tinh / Upland farm \n0.2 \n Small \n1.0 \n Large \n\n175 \n180 \n\n100 \n100 \n\n225 \n240 \n\n200 \n190 \n\n200 \n200 \n\n100 \n100 \n\n200 \n200 \n\n300 \n300 \n\n200 \n200 \n\n200 \n200 \n\n200 \n200 \n\n200 \n200 \n\n200 \n200 \n\n100 \n100 \n\n250 \n260 \n\n250 \n250 \n\nD = dong, FW = future with, FWO = future without. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n\n \n \nSubproject \nThach Thanh  \nThuong My Trung \nThach Han \nTay Nam Huong Tra \nTra Cau \nLa Tinh \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nWithout \n1.3 \n3.0 \n3.8 \n2.3 \n3.35 \n1.84 \n\nTable A11.5: Return to Household Labor \u2013 Without and With Project \n\nLarge Farms \nWith \n2.3 \n4.9 \n5.3 \n4.1 \n4.24 \n3.29 \n\nIncremental \n1.0 \n1.9 \n1.5 \n1.7 \n0.89 \n1.46 \n\nSmall Farms \n\nWithout \n0.95 \n2.15 \n3.80 \n1.33 \n1.65 \n2.59 \n\nWith \n2.15 \n3.92 \n4.49 \n2.41 \n2.72 \n3.92 \n\nIncremental \n1.20 \n1.77 \n0.70 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.33 \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nE. \n\nAssessment of Economic Returns \n\nthe \n\n18. \nInvestment  and  Recurrent  Costs.  All  costs  are  in  constant  2005  terms.  Investment \ncosts  are  net  of  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  Local  costs  have  been \nadjusted by the standard conversion factor of 0.9. For each subproject, costs are presented in \ntwo subsets: (i) those defined by the construction program, including design, resettlement and \ncompensation,  construction,  and  environmental  management;  and  (ii) \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  programs  for  the  provincial  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development \n(DARD),  IMCs,  and  WUGs.  Costs  associated  with  the  national  institutional  arrangements  and \nproject  management,  including  the  gender  action  plan,  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  and \nproject monitoring, are included as overheads for the overall Project. \n \nEconomic Worth. The economic analysis shows that EIRRs for the subprojects are 16\u2013\n19. \n18%  when  the  analysis  includes  only  the  construction  costs  (Table  A11.6).  The  proportion  of \nbenefit derived from agricultural output is 68% while nearly 30% is derived from both shrimp and \naquaculture.  When  the  costs  of  institutional  strengthening  are  included  the  EIRRs  for  the \nsubprojects range from 14\u201317%. The overall project EIRR is estimated to be 16.1% based on \nthe  construction  costs  only,  and  15%  with  the  inclusion  of  all  institutional  strengthening  and \nproject  management  costs.  The  level  of  non-quantified  benefits  from  the  institutional \nstrengthening is likely to be substantial because the IMCs that will be strengthened operate over \nmuch larger areas than the command areas of the target subprojects. The Project is considered \nto  be  economically  viable,  although  a  stringent  viability  analysis  will  be  needed  once  final \ndesigns  have  been  prepared  and  costs  estimated  more  accurately.  The  switching  values \nindicate  the  investment  to  be  relatively  insensitive  to  increased  costs  or  reduced  benefits  with \nthe  exception  of  Huang  Tra  (Thua  Thien  Hue  Province)  which  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  both \nbenefits and costs. \n \n\nTable A11.6: Estimated Subproject and Project Economic Worth \n\nEIRR \n\nNPV (12%) \n\nConstruction  Construction Construction Construction\n \n\n \n\nSwitching value \nConstruction Only \n\nand \nInstitution \n16.1 \n\nand \nInstitution \n24,782 \n\nReduced \nBenefits \n-22% \n\nIncreased  \nCosts \n\n+33% \n\n16.5 \n\n15.7 \n\n16.9 \n\n16.9 \n\n26,157 \n\n63,628 \n\n15.2 \n16.4 \n\n16.4 \n18.1 \n\n45,790 \n61,309 \n\nThach \nThanh \nThach \nHan \nTra Cau \nThuong \nMy Trung \nTay Nam \nHuong Tra \nLa Tinh \nTotal \nProject \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n65,745 \n237,877 \n\n18.2 \n16.1 \n\n21,798 \n\n17 \n15 \n\n14.4 \n\n51,434 \n\n35,612 \n51,550 \n\n12,390 \n\n55,946 \n185,115 \n\n-21% \n\n-20% \n-27% \n\n-13% \n\n-26% \n-18% \n\n+34% \n\n+29% \n+44% \n\n+19% \n\n+42% \n+26% \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11       59  \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional Analysis \n\n20. \nEach  irrigation  scheme  is  managed  through  an  IMC  under  the  control  of  provincial \nauthorities. IMCs are state-owned enterprises that face significant limitations in their autonomy \nand role. The national and provincial regulations under which the IMCs work leave little freedom \nfor  local  decision  making.  The  IMCs  are  financed  through  water-use  fees  whose  levels  are \ndetermined by provincial authorities. The revenue provides sufficient revenue for the fixed and \nvariable costs of the organizations but not for the full O&M costs of the irrigation schemes which \ncontinue to degrade. The IMCs have little knowledge of the water users and their needs, or of \nthe irrigation schemes they serve\u2014all of which limits their ability to prioritize the allocation and \nuse  of  water  and  to  plan  maintenance  programs.  During  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance,  their  management  capacity  was  assessed  as  weak,  with  limited  capacity  and \nopportunity for strategic decision making.  \n \n21. \nThe financial  viability of  IMCs  is  \u201cat  risk\u201d because of their (i) lack of  strategic focus,  (ii) \ncontinued  focus  on  engineering  works  and  skills  that  are  no  longer  required,  (iii)  inability  to \ndeliver  reliable  and  timely  water  (which  reduces  water  fee  collection  rates),  (iv)  inappropriate \nwater  fees,  (v)  non-involvement  of  water  users  in  the  management  and  operation  of  irrigation \nschemes,  and  (vi)  unclear  ownership  of  irrigation  assets.  Most  IMCs  operate  with  financial \ndeficits,  which  are  financed  through  national  and  provincial  subsidies.  Financial  resources \nconstrain O&M of schemes.  \n \n22. \nFor  Thanh  Hoa,  a  50%  increase  in  water  revenue  is  needed  to  break  even  on  current \ncost  structures.  To  additionally  finance  the  predicted  incremental  increase  in  O&M  costs,  a \n100% increase in water fees is needed. The Project will provide significant support to develop \nbusiness plans that will move the IMCs toward financial autonomy. The release of project funds \nfor  civil  works  in  the  subprojects  will  be  conditional  upon  the  IMCs\u2019  providing  acceptable \nbusiness plans. This will mitigate the risk of increased deficits among the IMCs. \n \nG. \n\nRisk \n\n23. \nThe economic analysis assumes that the whole of the net command area is converted to \nirrigated production phased in over 3 years following construction. The major risk is the ability of \nthe DARDs  to achieve the construction schedule and  of the IMCs to provide  water in a timely \nand reliable manner. The risks have been addressed through the linking of construction to the \ndevelopment of business plans and through the use of a extended construction schedule based \non 0%, 10%, 25% 35%, 20%, 10% by project year. The level of water-user support provided for \non-farm  works  and  the  establishment  of  WUGs/WUAs  will  ensure  that  the  beneficiaries \nparticipate  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  tertiary  irrigation  development  early  on.  This \nsupport  will  increase  awareness  of  the  potential  benefits  of  the  subproject  and  help  create  a \npartnership  of  WUGs  and  IMCs  to  strengthen  O&M  of  the  infrastructure  provided.  Training  for \nimproved  irrigation  management  will  be  provided.  In  addition,  beneficiaries  will  avail  of \nagricultural extension services to improve returns from irrigated agriculture and aquaculture.  \n \nH. \n \n24. \nThe  average  income  level  of  beneficiaries  in  the  six  subprojects  will  be  increased  by \nD57,700 per capita per month. This ranges from more than D100,000 in Thuong My Trung and \nLa  Tinh  to  D30,000\u201354,000  in  the  remaining  subprojects.  Under  the  Project,  more  than  6,000 \npoor  households  will  become  nonpoor  with  an  overall  poverty  impact  ratio  of  15%,  including \n28% for La Tinh, 22% for Tra Cau, 21% for Thach Thanh and Thuong My Trung, 10% for Tay \nNam Huong Tra, and 8% for Thach Han (Table A11.7). \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItems \n\nUnit \n\nTotal \n\nThach Thanh \n\nThach Han \n\nTra Cau \n\nLa Tinh \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n63 \n\n48 \n\n51 \n\n52 \n\n35 \n\n47 \n\n150,000 \n \n\n150,000 \n \n\n150,000 \n \n\n150,000 \n \n\n150,000 \n \n\n \n\nTable A11.7: Poverty Impact  \n \n\nThuong \nMy Trung \n \n\n \n\n53.7 \n20 \n18.9 \n4.2 \n3.2 \n73.7\n128,100 \n76,860 \n0.5 \n\n13.8 \n14.9 \n34 \n25.5 \n11.8 \n28.7 \n252,600 \n148,781 \n0.5 \n\n3,782 \n39,190 \n5.0 \n\n7,838 \n4,938 \n\n38,429 \n20,157 \n42,862 \n\n170,962 \n119,722 \n \n63 \n0.29 \n\n4,188 \n44,336 \n5.2 \n\n8,526 \n4,083 \n\n85,493 \n57,215 \n107,541 \n\n360,141 \n256,322 \n \n48 \n0.72 \n\n6\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nTay Nam \nHuong Tra \n\n27.4 \n19 \n26.2 \n19 \n8.4 \n46.4 \n209,100 \n92,213 \n0.5 \n\n3,176 \n50,269 \n5.0 \n\n10,054 \n5,228 \n\n35,749 \n18,595 \n30,826 \n\n239,926 \n123,039 \n \n52 \n0.21 \n\n19.7 \n17.7 \n32 \n25.1 \n5.5 \n37.4 \n213,400 \n123,345 \n0.5 \n\n150,000 \n \n\n14,078 \n136,017 \n4.8 \n\n28,515 \n14,543 \n\n172,971 \n52,526 \n32,181 \n\n245,581 \n155,526 \n \n51 \n0.21 \n\n45 \n16 \n25 \n12 \n2 \n61.0 \n151,000 \n61,910 \n0.5 \n\n5,001 \n94,639 \n5.0 \n\n18,928 \n6,625 \n\n107,604 \n61,319 \n53,994 \n\n204,994 \n115,904 \n \n35 \n0.36 \n\n0.61 \n\n1,455 \n22 \n\n8.5 \n18.1 \n34 \n26.6 \n12.8 \n26.6 \n299,300 \n140,072 \n0.5 \n\n3,411 \n36,034 \n4.4 \n\n8,246 \n3,876 \n\n100,582 \n67,484 \n156,066 \n\n455,366 \n296,138 \n \n47 \n1.04 \n\n0.27 \n\n1,073 \n28 \n\n18,272 \n\n28,278 \n\n120,445 \n\n17,154 \n\n46,285 \n\n33,098 \n\nA.
