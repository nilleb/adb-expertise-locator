Environmental impact assessments have \nbeen  conducted  for  the  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Expressway  (E-1) \nand Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal Expressway (E-4) projects. Summaries \nwere  disclosed  publicly  on  30  May  2006  and  4  April  2007, \nrespectively. \n \nUnder  the  strategic  framework  \u201cVision  2030\u201d  the  Government  of \nPakistan  (the  Government)  plans  to  raise  the  trade  to  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) ratio from 30% to about 60%. This would \nbe equivalent to $600 billion by 2030. To achieve this target, key \nactions under the strategy will be improving trade competitiveness \nand  export  diversification.  Logistics  are  currently  seen  as  a  key \nconstraint to raising competitiveness and attracting private sector \ninvestment.  They  are  also  a  bottleneck  to  increasing  productivity \nas  well  as  to  deepening  and  diversifying  the  industrial  base  both \nof which are necessary to provide sustainable jobs for a growing \npopulation.  Several  actions  are  planned  or  underway  to  address \nis  a \nthe \ncomprehensive  road  network  investment  program.  An  enhanced \nroad  network  will  cut  the  time  and  cost  of  moving  goods  and \nservices  along \nthe \nfrom \nGovernment \n0.32 kilometers  per  square  kilometer  (km/km2)  at  present  to \n0.64 km/km2  by  2030.  In  addition  to  improvements  to  physical \ninfrastructure, \nincludes  meaningful  policy  and \ninstitutional  actions  aimed  at  providing  a  better  enabling \nenvironment  for  investment,  for  industrial  diversification,  and  for \nthe logistics industry as a whole.  \n \nPakistan\u2019s  domestic  trade  flows  are  concentrated  in  one  major \nnorth\u2013south  transport corridor. The  proposed actions, while aimed \nat  making  this  corridor  more  efficient,  will  also  have  a  major  and \nbroader  impact  on  the  performance  of  the  entire  transport  sector \nand thus on the economy overall. This comprehensive approach is \nembodied  in  a  special  initiative  called  the  National  Trade  Corridor \nImprovement Program (NTCIP). The Government views NTCIP as \na  key  success  factor  to  the  country\u2019s  growth  prospects,  to \ninclusiveness,  to  employment  creation  and  social  service  renewal, \nand \nthe  execution  of  second  generation  sector  and \nmacroeconomic reforms. NTCIP represents a flagship endeavor by \n\nlogistical  chain.  Specifically, \n\ninvestment  gap.  One  of \n\nroad  density \n\nlogistics  and \n\nto  double \n\nthe  entire \n\ninitiative \n\nintends \n\nthese \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\ninvestment  plan \n\nthe  Government  and  the  private  sector  to  bring  about  better \nconnectivity and trade facilitation. Beside roads, the initiative covers \nports,  railways,  airports,  customs  clearing  procedures,  tariffs,  and \nthe trucking industry. The rationale for NTCIP is embedded in and \nemanates  from  plans  for  growth,  job  creation,  and  trade.  When \nfully implemented, these efforts will save $5 billion\u20137.5 billion per \nannum  that are  currently  lost  because  of inefficient  logistics.  The \nlatter  will  thus  increase  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  GDP, \nbringing the country closer to other benchmark countries in Asia. \n \nThe  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  is  responsible  for  the \noperation, maintenance, and development of the national highway \nsystem.  NHA  manages  11,400  km  of  roads,  of  which  30%  are \nalready  toll  roads.  The  efficiency  of  the  road  network  has  been \nconstrained by slow moving traffic, poor quality surfaces, and non-\nvehicular  traffic.  Currently,  it  takes  72  hours  to  travel  between \nPeshawar  and  Karachi,  a  distance  of  about  1,700  km.  The \ninvestment  in  the  backbone  of  the  national  trade  corridor  is \nexpected to reduce this travel time to 36 hours after completion.  \n \nAs a core component of NTCIP, NHA has developed the National \nTrade  Corridor  highway \n(NTC  highway \ninvestment plan). It covers the corridor backbone from Peshawar \nto  Karachi  and  the  outlying  links  that  connect  Pakistan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Gwadar Port in Baluchistan. The \ninitiative  includes  not  only  new  road  construction  but  also  the \nimprovement  of  over  3,500  km  of  roads,  national  highways, \nexpressways,  and  motorways.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  is  an  active  partner  of  the  Government  in  the  road  sector \nand  is  involved  in  policy  formulation  including  the  National \nTransport  Policy.  ADB  is  currently  supporting  the  engagement  of \nan advisor to formulate a national trade corridor strategy. In view \nof  this  long-standing  relationship  in  the  sector,  the  Government \nhas  approached  ADB  along  with  other  financing  agencies  to \nfinance the investment plan for the medium term. ADB\u2019s proposed \nshare  of  the  NTC  highway  investment  represents  about  20%  of \nthe  total.  Key  sections  of  the  motorway  and  expressway  network \nwill  be  financed  through  the  National  Trade  Corridor  Highway \nInvestment Program (the Program), and key sections of highways \nwill  be  financed  through  the  National  Highway  Development \nSector  Investment  Program  (NHDSIP)  approved  in  2005.  The \nNTC highway investment plan has an estimated economic internal \nrate  of  return  of  39%  and  a  total  average  economic  savings \nestimated at PRs200 billion per year.  \n \nA  road  sector  development  framework  (RSDF)  was  agreed  with \nthe  Government  in  2005.  This  road  map  addresses  major  policy \nand  institutional  issues.  Some  targeted  milestones  have  been \ncompleted, others are on schedule, and some have faced delays. \nRSDF  has  been  updated  to  reflect  current concerns  and  lessons \nlearned  from  those  delays  and  from  other  ADB  projects  in  the \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nthe  concept  of \n\nsector.  The  sequencing  of  interventions  is  well  focused,  the \npackage  of  modalities  includes  private  and  public  sector  actions, \nand  the  policy  framework  is  defined  and  endorsed  by  the \nauthorities.  \n \nThe support components of the Program are needed not only for \nbest  practice  purposes  in  safeguards  but  also  to  underpin  the \nreform momentum for the sector and for the RSDF. Specifically, \nunder the Program assistance will be provided to enable NHA\u2019s \nexperienced  team  to  manage  the  expanded  portfolio  of  assets \nplanned under the NTC highway investment plan. Various actions \nare also included to reinforce capacity development and thus the \nimplementation of the RSDF. The non-investment measures are \n(i)  policy  reforms  and  implementation,  (ii)  road  management,  (iii) \nhuman  resource  development  and  management  in  NHA,  (iv) \nproject  preparation  and  implementation,  (v) safeguards,  and  (vi) \nprivate sector participation. The support component is estimated to \ncost $12.5 million.  \n \nTo  advance \nindustrial  diversification  and \ncommercial  activity  along  the  national  trade  corridor  and  to \nmaximize  traffic  flows,  a  framework  for  spatial  planning  and \ninvestment planning along the corridor is required. An NTC team \nwith representatives from the private sector (e.g., business groups \nand  chambers  of  commerce),  government  agencies,  and \nacademia  will  be  established  for  this  purpose.  This  team  would \ncoordinate  the  development  of  an  NTC  highway  business  plan. \nADB  will  provide  a  technical  assistance  grant  of  $500,000 \nequivalent in conjunction with the Program to develop a business \nplan for the motorways and expressways between Peshawar and \nKhanewal. \n \nPrivate sector participation is an integral part of the RSDF. ADB is \nproviding support for private sector involvement in the road sector \nby  pursuing  pilot  projects  and  advisory  work.  In  this  support  and \nother  interventions,  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  department \nand  public  sector  department  will  work  together  to  assist  the \nGovernment.  Pilot  projects  will  incorporate  lessons  learned  in \nstructuring  and  implementation  from  the  recent  public-private \npartnership (PPP) projects in the road sector in Pakistan. ADB will \nwork  with  the  Government  and  NHA\u2019s  private-public  partnership \nunit  to  strengthen  the  approach  to  selecting,  structuring,  bidding, \nand negotiating PPP transactions.  \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  partially  finance  the \ninvestment  program  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility \n(MFF). The amount requested is $900 million. It will target parts of \nthe  NTC  highway  investment  plan  related  to  expressways  and \nmotorways  over  a  10-year  period  and  represents  16.6%  of  the \noverall  NTC  highway  investment  plan.  The  MFF  has  a  maximum \nutilization  period  of  10 years.  Under  the  MFF,  periodic  financing \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nto \n\ninto  a \n\nframework \n\nrequests (PFRs) will be converted into separate loans. \n \nThe  Government  has  entered \nfinancing \nagreement  (FFA)  with  ADB  with  a  set  of  representations  and \ntechnical,  operational, \nwarranties  related,  among  others, \nfinancial, safeguard, governance, capacity, and fiduciary oversight \nmatters.  The  FFA  satisfies  the  relevant  requirements  for  ADB\u2019s \npilot  financing  instruments  and  modalities.  It  will  represent  the \nbasis  for  ADB  to  monitor  adherence  to  policies  and  procedures \nand best practices in key areas. \n \nThe  MFF  is  the  most  suitable  modality  for  ADB\u2019s  intervention  in \nthe NTC highway investment plan because of several key success \nfactors:  (i)  there  is  a  strategic  framework  and  strong  economic \nrationale  for  the  NTC  in  general  and  for  the  road  network  in \nparticular,  (ii)  NHA  has  a  well-structured  investment  program \nblending physical and technical support components phased over \ntime  and  incorporating  a  range  of  interventions,  (iii)  the  sector  is \nunderpinned by the RSDF combining sector and thematic issues, \nand (iv) NHA has a phased implementation plan.  \n \nThe  MFF  blends  project  readiness  with  financial,  technical  and \nthematic  considerations  and  enables  ADB  to  maintain  an  active \npolicy  dialogue  throughout  the  life  of  the  Program.  ADB  support \nfor  the  NTC  highway  investment  plan  builds  the  foundation  for \nnetwork connectivity by providing financing for key road sections. \nThe MFF provides comfort to the private sector not only for those \nconsidering  investment  in  road  projects  but  most  of  all  for \nindustrial  investment.  Flexibility  of  timing  and  products  under  the \nMFF will ensure that the projects are structured to fit the existing \nmarket  environment  for  PPPs  and  to  maximize  benefits  to  the \ncountry.  \n \nA program loan approach for the reform agenda is not appropriate \nsince disbursements for road construction cannot be conveniently \nlinked  to  satisfying  policy  conditions.  A  sector  loan  would  have \nbeen  suitable  had  the  program  comprised  a  larger  number  of \nsmaller  road  sections,  a  scenario  more  typically  associated  with \nrural  road  networks.  Considering  the  need  to  fulfill  safeguard \nconcerns for larger projects, the time required to prepare projects \ncannot  be  constrained  by  financial  concerns.  A  sector  loan \ncommitting the entire amount for the investment plan at the outset \nwould leave NHA with a large contingent liability and undisbursed \nloan  amount  should  extra  time  be  needed  to  fully  prepare  the \nprojects  and  would  also  lead  the  Government  to  incur  additional \ncommitment fees. \n \nThe Government has submitted the first PFR to ADB for a loan of \n$545 million to be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR).  The  package  includes  a  loan  of  $10  million  equivalent \nfrom  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources  to  fund  the \n\n\fRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Program  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nsupport components. The first PFR is presented to the ADB Board \nof Directors, together with this document and the FFA. \n \nThe  Government  views  investment  and  trade  as  key  success \nfactors to growth, employment, inclusiveness, and overall poverty \nreduction.  Pakistan\u2019s  domestic  investment  and  trade  flows  are \nconcentrated  along  one  major  transport  corridor.  The  corridor \nconnects  not  only  key  business  centers  in  the  country  but  also \nconnects  Pakistan  to  the  outside  world.  It  is  a  key  exit  route  for \ntrade  coming  from  Central  Asia.  The  network  is  supported  by \nnational  highways  and  feeder  roads,  ports,  and  airports,  but  the \nexpressway  backbone  network  is  incomplete.  The  proposed \nprogram targets the completion of this network.  \n \nThe  proposed  Program  is  derived  from  Pakistan\u2019s  long-term \ntransportation  strategy  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  NTCIP.  The \nimpact  of  the  Program  will  be  trade  growth  and  the  outcome  will \nbe  a  more  efficient  NTC  highway  network.  The  Program  will \nimprove  Pakistan\u2019s  competitiveness  and  link  the  country  more \neffectively to the outside world. It will also provide trade routes for \nothers in the region. \n \nThe total investment cost of the NTC highway investment plan for \n2007\u20132014 is estimated at $5.36 billion. \n\nNational Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan \n\nProgram \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n\nGovernment \nADB \nOther IFIs or BFIs \nOther \nTotal \n \n\n$ million \n210 \n890 \n \n \n1,100 \n\n \n\nShare  \n20% \n80% \n \n \n100% \n \n\n$ million \n1,632a \n1,082b \n1,547 \n1,102 \n5,363 \n\n \n\nShare \n30% \n20% \n29% \n21% \n100% \n\n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  IFI  =  international  financial  institutions,  BFI  =  bilateral \nfinancial  institutions,  NHDSIP  =  National  Highway  Development  Sector  Investment \nProgram, Program = National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program.  \na  Government  component  for  NTC  includes  roads  to  be  financed  by  Water  And  Power \n\nDevelopment Authority. \n\nb 16.6% from the Program and 3.4% from NHDSIP  \nSource: Asian Development Bank and National Highway Authority estimates. \n \n\n \n\nProjects (OCR) \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nAmount \n545 \n164 \n709 \n\nTranche 1 \n($ million) \n\nShare \n\n77% \n23% \n100% \n\nProgram Support (ADF) \nAmount \n10.0 \n2.5 \n12.5 \n\nShare \n80% \n20% \n100% \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital \nresources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility\u2013Amount and \nTerms \n\nDisbursement \n\n \nAllocation Terms \n\n \nAdvance Contracting \nand Retroactive \nFinancing \n\nThe maximum financing amount available under this MFF is $900 \nmillion.

The  Government  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \nthe MFF as per the FFA and loan agreements. \n \nNHA  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  investment  component \nand for the support component.  \n \nProcurement to be financed under the Program will be carried out \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  will  be  used  for  goods  and  works  funded  under  the \ninvestment program. Civil works contracts with an estimated value \nless  than  $5  million  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive \nbidding \nthrough  ADB\u2019s  standard  prequalification  procedure. \nSupply contracts will use limited international bidding for contracts \nwith an estimated value of $100,000 up to $1 million and shopping \narrangements  for  contracts  less  than  $100,000.  The  goods  and \nsupply  contracts  in  excess  of  $1  million  will  be  procured  through \nICB.  ICB  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \nthe equivalent of $5 million or more. A procurement plan has been \nprepared to ensure maximum competition under ICB. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be \nfor,  among  others, \n(i) construction  supervision,  (ii) project  management  support, \n(iii) institutional  strengthening,  and  (iv)  a  NTC  highway  business \nplan.

This  risk  is  likely  to  be  short  term  in  nature. \nGeneral elections will bring about some short-term disruptions, but \nmost  analysts  point  to  a  continuation  of  the  reform  process \nincluding the so-called second generation reforms. \n \nThe  ability  to  attract  private  sector  investment  to  the  sector  is \nanother  concern.  The  investment  program  is  simply  too  large  for \nthe  public  sector  to  execute  entirely  through  its  own  resources. \nThe  Government  needs  to  look  outside  for  funds  and  partners. \ntechnical \nADB  will  continue  support \nthe \nassistance  and  will  consider \nProgram and the private sector operations department.  \n \nThe provincial and district roads that feed into the NTC need to be \nfurther  improved  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  the  road  network. \nThe  Government  at  federal  and  local  level  needs  to  allocate \nadequate  resources  to  these  smaller  but  strategically  important \nroads.  The  NTC  strategy  will  identify  appropriate  industries  and \ntheir advantageous locations and the logistic hubs along the NTC. \nThis study will assist the Government to identify and concentrate \nresources  on  the  key  feeder  roads.

The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for developing a national trade corridor (NTC) highway business plan, \nand, if the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Program  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nFor its current high level of economic growth to be sustained, Pakistan must diversify its \neconomy  and  become  more  globally  competitive.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Trade  Corridor \nImprovement Program (NTCIP) is a holistic approach to reduce the bottlenecks inhibiting trade \nand  to  exploit  the  strategic  location  of  Pakistan  as  a  land  bridge  to  Central  Asia  and  the \nhinterlands  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  In  order  to  facilitate  this  goal, \nimprovements to road connectivity and efficiency are essential. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomy and Trade \n\n \n3. \nPakistan  has  experienced  strong  economic  growth  since  the  beginning  of  the  century, \nreaching  a  peak  of  8.4%  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2005  and  6.6%  in  FY2006.  The  outlook  is  for \ncontinued strong growth,1 based on the assumption that Pakistan will continue to implement the \nmacro-  and  microeconomic  policies  necessary  to  sustain  and  accelerate  economic  growth. \nAlthough  the  textile  sector  still  dominates  exports,  recent  export  growth  has  been  marked  by \nincreasing diversity, particularly in manufactured goods. While imports of consumer goods have \nalso increased, their share of total imports dropped from about 15% in FY2001 to about 10% in \nFY2006.  \n \n4. \nIn terms of value, about 60% of Pakistan\u2019s imports originate from Asia. The PRC is the \ndominant source of non-oil imports and represents some 10% of total imports by value. Imports \nfrom  Europe  constituted  about  19%  of  imports  in  FY2006,  while  imports  from  North  America \ndeclined  to  about  7%.  Recorded  imports  from  neighboring  countries,  including  Afghanistan, \nIndia, and Iran accounted for about 4.2% of the total. While Pakistan\u2019s seaports are the closest \nfor Central Asian countries, transit traffic from Central Asia using the Peshawar\u2013Karachi corridor \nis negligible and accounts for only 1.5% of Pakistan\u2019s total merchandise trade.  \n \n5. \nThe  current  level  of  east\u2013west  traffic,  including  transit  traffic  using  Pakistan  as  a  land \nbridge between India and Iran, is low. Intraregional trade in South Asia is weak and the region is \nconsidered  the  least  integrated  in  the  world.2 Currently,  much  of  the  trade  between  India  and \nPakistan  is  routed  through  Dubai.  Direct  trade  would  avoid  such  detours  and  efficiency  losses. \nIndia\u2019s rapidly growing economy may have a \u201cpull\u201d effect not only on the economies of its direct \nneighbors  but  also  on  countries  that  would  use  the  Pakistan  east\u2013west  corridor  for  trade  with \nIndia.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Washington DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2.  \n\nRoad Sector \n\n \n \n6. \nThe transport sector contributes about 10% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \nIt is dominated by road transport which carries 91% of passenger traffic in passenger-kilometers \nand  96%  of  freight  traffic  in  ton-kilometers.  Road  transport  services  are  mainly  operated  by \nprivate sector enterprises with the small share of government-owned goods handled by a public \nsector agency.  \n \nOverall demand for road transport has increased rapidly in recent years. Gains in traffic on \n7. \nthe  road  network  have  been  at  the  expense  of  the  railway  network.  Extensive  investment  in \nrailways  and  restructuring  of  the  industry  will  be  needed  for  the  network  to  become  a  viable \nalternative  to  road  transport.3 In  the  meantime,  the  demand  for  road  transport  will  continue  to \nincrease.  \n \n8. \nThe  total  road  network  is  about  260,000  kilometers  (km),  of  which  11,400  km  are \nnational  highways,  92,500  km  are  provincial  highways,  and  150,000  km  are  district  or  urban \nroads.  The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  is  responsible  for  national  highways,  including \nlimited-access  motorways,  partial-access  expressways  and  unlimited-access  highways  that \nconstitute the arterial road network system. About 7,000 km of the national highway network are \ntwo-lane, undivided roads.  \n \n9. \nThe  NHA  has  prepared  a  comprehensive  plan  to  2015  to  upgrade  the  national  road \nnetwork and extend the highway system. The cost of implementing this plan is PRs480 billion \n($8.0 billion), of which about half is expected to be funded by external assistance (Table 1). The \nplan  provides  for  the  improvement  of  6,500  km  of  existing  roads  and  the  construction  of  \n2,500  km  of  new  expressways  and  motorways.  Parallel  plans  to  improve  7,600  km  and \nconstruct 4,500 km of provincial roads and special-area roads are also proposed in the Medium-\nTerm Development Framework (MTDF). \n \n\nTable 1: National Highway Development Cost Estimates and Financing Plan (2006\u20132015) a \n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Source \n\n% \n\nGovernment (ongoing and new) b \nPrivate Sector \nDevelopment Partner \n\nADB \nOther IFIs \nBilateral Financial Institutions \n\nPRs million \n184,440 \n34,623 \n\n$ million \n3,074 \n577 \n\n \n\n \n\n122,228 \n94,927 \n44,994 \n481,212 \n\n2,037 \n1,582 \n749 \n8,019 \n\n38.33 \n7.19 \n\n25.40 \n19.73 \n9.35 \n100.00 \n\nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ERA = Earthquake Reconstruction Agency, IFI = International \nFinancial  Institutions,  MTDF  =  Medium-Term  Development  Framework,  WAPDA  =  Water  and \nPower Development Authority.  \na  Government budgetary allocations from 2011 are carry forwards.

This investment improved the pavement international \nroughness index from 8.9 in 2000 to 4.7 in 2006 (Appendix 2). \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nRoad Sector  \n\n \n\n11. \nRoad Assets. Travel  on  roads  is  severely  constrained  by  non-motorized  and  slow-\nmoving  motorized  traffic.  As  a  result,  transportation  is  inefficient,  travel  and  delivery  times  for \ngoods  are  uncertain,  and  transport  costs  are  higher  than  they  should  be.  Road  safety  is  also \ncompromised.  The  existing  roads  must  be  improved  and  new  roads  built  to  segregate  traffic. \nThe Government intends to double the road density from 0.32 kilometers per square kilometer \n(km/km2) in 2006 to 0.64 km/km2 2030 (Vision 2030). \n \n12. \nSustainability  (Road  Funding).  NHA  has  a  development  budget  and  a  maintenance \nbudget.  Development  funds  are  in  the  form  of  government  cash  loans  and  are  currently  \nPRs25  billion  per  year,  which  is  below  the  PRs40  billion  per  year  needed  to  satisfy  the \ngovernment plan for highway construction and to meet the needs of the growing economy.  \n \n13. \nNHA has a Road Asset Management Directorate, which has achieved positive results in \nplanning  and  implementing  road  maintenance.  For  FY2007,  the  funding  requirement  for  the \nnational  highway  network  and  motorways  was  estimated  at  PRs14  billion  for  periodic \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation,  with  an  additional  PRs3  billion  for  routine  maintenance.  The \navailable  total  budget  for  the  year  was  under  PRs7  billion,4 and  a  maintenance  program  was \nprepared  according  to  this  budget.  Without  maintenance,  these  roads  will  require  more \nexpensive improvements in the future.  \n \nRoad Safety. Since 2000, reported road accidents have averaged over 10,000 per year \n14. \nand resulted in about 5,150 fatalities. The rate of about 10 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles is very \nhigh  when  compared  with  rates  in  developed  countries  but  low  for  developing  countries.  The \nmain  causes  of  road  accidents  are  driving  at  speeds  inappropriate  for  vehicle  and  road \nconditions, lack of safety awareness, poor discipline, and poor enforcement of regulations.  \n \n15. \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership (PPP).  PPP for roads in Pakistan is at an early stage and \nthe  Government  has  been  considering  various  ways  of  attracting  private  funding.  The  main \nrestraints have been the enabling environment, lack of track record for traffic volumes, and the \nlength  of  time  for  selection  of  and  negotiation  with  the  private  sector  partner.  To  enable \nwidespread use of PPP, the Government has established an infrastructure project development \nfacility. If expertise is developed at the national level, it will benefit all stages, including planning, \npromotion, selection, negotiation and implementation and can be used to form partnerships at \nprovincial and local levels where capacity is limited.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Annual  maintenance,  repair,  and  operational  expenditures  for  existing  motorways  and  national  roads  are  funded \nfrom  several  sources:  government  grants  (about  PRs1.4  billion),  road  tolls  net  of  collection  costs  (about  PRs4.5 \nbillion), and miscellaneous income from right-of-way leases, police fines for traffic infringements and overloading, \nand advertising for the current year.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nNational Highway Authority \n\n \n16. \nNHA  is  responsible  for  the  operation,  maintenance,  and  development  of  the  national \nhighway  system.  It  is  an  autonomous  agency  with  a  functional  structure  and  decentralized \nimplementation arrangements through regional provincial offices. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  and  the  World  Bank  have  provided  assistance  to  NHA.5 Policy  dialogue  and  financial \nsupport  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  contributed  to:  (i)  preparing  a  rolling  5-year \nmedium-term  investment  and  maintenance  plan;  (ii)  increasing  the  sections  of  the  national \nhighway  network  that  charges  tolls  and  using  toll  receipts  for  road  development  and \nmaintenance  programs;  (iii)  setting  up  the  Road  Asset  Management  Directorate  (which  has \nbeen  fully  functional  since  2003);  (iv)  enforcing  the  National  Highway  Safety  Ordinance  and \nextending  it  to  cover  additional  road  lengths  in  each  subsequent  year;  (v)  collecting  monetary \npenalties  since  2003  for  violations  of  traffic  ordinances  and  allocating  the  collections  to  road \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  programs;  (vi)  introducing  standard  operating  procedures  for \nfinancial  management  and  an  accompanying  financial  manual;  (vii)  recruiting  financial  experts \nfor NHA and independent auditing of financial statements; (viii) installing and activating weighing \nstations  to  control  axle  loads;  (ix)  establishing  a  public\u2013private  partnership  cell  in  NHA,  (x) \nestablishing  a  highway  safety  unit  in  NHA;  and  (xi)  annual  consultations  with  stakeholders  to \ndevelop  the  road  maintenance  plan.  These  reforms  must  be  sustained  and  capacity  added  to \nenable NHA to plan, implement, and maintain its expanding portfolio of roads. \n \n17. \nSustainability  (Road  Funding).  There  is  a  framework  in  place  that  allows  NHA\u2019s \nfinancial performance and sustainability to be assessed, but the application of rigorous financial \nstandards  is  unlikely  to  provide  a  true  reflection  of  its  current  status.  When  the  NHA  was \nestablished, the capital investment grants given to its predecessor, the National Highway Board, \nwere converted into cash development loans that NHA is now required (but is unable) to repay \nor service. The arrears are substantial. Although tolls are the main NHA revenue source, only \n30% of the roads it supervises are toll roads. Current revenues cover about 32% of operation \nand  maintenance  costs  for  the  current  year.  Provincial  roads  that  are  often  in  a  very  poor \ncondition  have  been  brought  under  federal  control  and  the  maintenance  budget  of  NHA  has \nbeen increased. A policy decision is needed on the resolution of cash development loans and \non  whether  road-user  charges  should  be  set  with  a  view  to  recovering  the  full  costs  of  road \nprovision, including capital costs.6 \n \n18. \nAccountability  and  Transparency.  NHA  has  an  action  plan  to  improve  its  financial \nmanagement.  Fixed  asset  registers  and  adjustments  of  land  acquisition  advances  have  been \nprepared,  staff  members  with  professional  qualifications  have  been  hired,  and  financial \nstatements have been independently audited. As it is a public service provider, the performance \nof NHA can not be monitored simply through financial statements. Other performance standards \nwill need to be developed, monitored, and disclosed.   \n \n19. \nEfficient  Service  Provider.  NHA  has  made  significant  progress  toward  its  goal  of \nbecoming an efficient service provider; however, it is still in transition and has limited in-house \ncapability in strategic planning, project and asset management, and network operations. Further \nprogress  will  be  needed  if  it  is  to  manage  existing  and  new  roads  and  to  implement  its \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2001.

Measures  need  to  be  taken  to  attract  and  retain  talented \nqualified staff.  \n \n20. \nVehicle overloading is a major cause of premature pavement deterioration and of road \naccidents.  There  are  now  54  weighing  stations  throughout  the  country.  Fines  are  low  (about \nPRs100 per excess ton) and insignificant in relation to haulage revenues and load value. Where \noverloading  is  extreme,  many  drivers  are  unable  to  pay  and  the  fine  is  overlooked.  Neither \nunloading  facilities  nor  storage  spaces  are  available  at  the  weighing  stations;  therefore, \noffloading to achieve legal limits is not possible. The number of weighing stations needs to be \nincreased and limits implemented more rigorously. \n \n21. \nSafeguards.  The  Government  has  put  in  place  new  procedures  for  acquiring  land, \nrelocating  services,  and  planning  resettlement.  A  planning  document  for  land  acquisition  must \nbe submitted and approved before any other project activity can be approved. This is because \nin  the  past  land  acquisition  in  major  projects  caused  delays  and  significantly  increased  costs. \nNHA\u2019s experience of its own projects and those of other agencies has demonstrated the need to \nstrengthen  capacity  for  preparing  and  implementing  safeguard  requirements.  The  safeguard \nfunction  in  NHA  needs  to  be  upgraded  and  mainstreamed.  However,  there  is  a  shortage  of \nqualified  and  experienced  social  safeguards  experts  in  Pakistan  so  training  of  staff  will  be \nessential for implementation and monitoring. Environmental laws have been in place since 1997 \nand are consistent with ADB\u2019s environmental policy.  \n \n22. \nPublic-private  partnership  (PPP).  NHA  has  successfully  encouraged  private  sector \nparticipation  by  outsourcing  maintenance,  operation  of  tolls,  and  planning  (detailed  design, \nfeasibility  study).  Implementing  the  highways  components  of  the  MTDF  and  national  trade \ncorridor highway investment plan will require a major increase in funding and PPP financing is \nproposed for at least 7% of the 2006\u20132015 funding requirement. Given the limited progress with \nPPPs to date, this target will place a considerable demand on NHA's management capabilities. \nSignificant  increases  in  private  sector  participation  need  to  be  managed  effectively;  poorly \nexecuted PPP projects not only fail to realize their potential benefits, they may discourage future \ninitiatives.  NHA  identified  projects  valued  at  approximately  PRs80  billion  in  the  National \nHighway  Development  Plan;  however,  it  has  had  difficulty  in  attracting  private  sector \ninvestments because of the lack of an enabling environment and traffic track record to underpin \nprivate  sector  transactions.  Only  PRs7  billion  has  been  invested.7 Build  operate  and  transfer \nschemes, management contracts, and concession contracts are being explored.  \n \n\n3. \n\nNational Trade Corridor Improvement Plan \n\n23. \nIf Pakistan is to achieve the Government\u2019s \u201cVision 2030\u201d it will have to improve its trade \nto GDP ratio from 30% in FY2005 to 60% by FY2030, or from $14 billion to about $600 billion.8 \nTo  achieve  this  target,  the  government  plans  to  improve  the  country\u2019s  trade  competitiveness \nand  diversify  exports.  The  Government  has  identified  logistical  barriers  to  trade  as  a  key \nconstraint on competitiveness and has formulated a comprehensive program aimed at reducing \n\n                                                 \n7  Of the seven projects planned for PPP, concession agreements have been signed for two: the Karachi\u2013Hyderabad \nmotorway M-9 (PRs6.3 billion) and Lakpass Tunnel (PRs679 million).

In  addition  to  improvements  to  physical \ninfrastructure,  the  action  program  includes  policy  and  institutional  measures  to  provide  an \nenabling environment for the logistics industry.  \n \nBecause  Pakistan\u2019s  domestic  trade  flows  are  concentrated  in  one  major  north\u2013south \n24. \ntransport  corridor,  the  proposed  measures,  while  aimed  at  making  this  corridor  more  efficient, \nwill have a major impact on the performance of the entire transport sector and on the economy \noverall.  Because  of \nthe \nGovernment  views  the  NTCIP  as  a  key  factor  in  promoting  growth  and  reducing  poverty.  The \nNTCIP  is  a  flagship  endeavor  by  the  Government  and  the  private  sector  to  improve  trade \nfacilitation, ports, railways, airports, highways, and the trucking industry.  \n \nThe NTCIP\u2019s overall objective is to foster trade and economic growth through increased \n25. \ncompetitiveness. Consistent with the concept of trade logistics (defined as a chain of services \nsupported by infrastructure, policies, and procedures), the NTCIP addresses constraints posed \nby individual components. While an analysis of the transport cost chain indicates that Pakistan \ncompares  quite  favorably  against  international  benchmarks,  this  masks  major  external \ndiseconomies  that  jeopardize  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  system.  The  NTCIP  therefore \ncombines investments in physical infrastructure with policy and institutional reforms. When fully \nimplemented, it is estimated that NTCIP will save $5 billion\u2013$7.5 billion per annum currently lost \nbecause of the inefficiency of the transport sector.9 \n \n\nfar-reaching \n\nimpact, \n\n4. \n\nNational Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan \n\nThe proposed national trade corridor highway investment plan (NTC highway investment \n26. \nplan) will reduce travel and transit costs and times both on new roads and on the existing road \nnetwork. It will also improve road safety. The current average travel times between Karachi port \nand industrial centers in Punjab (about 48 hours) and the city of Peshawar (about 72 hours) will \nbe reduced by about half.  \n \n27. \nThe  NTC  highway  investment  plan  covers  3,500  km  of  road  construction  and \nimprovements along the backbone of the corridor from Peshawar to Karachi, connections with \nthe PRC, and connections to the sea port in Gwadar (Appendix 3).  \n \n\n5. \n\nMaximizing the Impact of National Trade Corridor Improvement  \n\n28. \nThe NTC highway investment plan will have to ensure a rational allocation of resources \nto individual projects and modes of transport. Decisions will need to be based on comparative \ncosts and sound investment analysis, especially for motorways, to avoid the problems faced by \nother  motorway  projects  in  Pakistan.  The  Islamabad  to  Lahore  motorway  (M2)  has  been  in \noperation  since  1997.  While  toll  rates  have  been  adjusted 10 over  time  and  revenues  have \nincreased, the M2 has so far been unable to cover even operating and maintenance costs, not \nto  mention  capital  costs.  There  has  been  little  development  along  the  road,  so  the  envisioned \neconomic  benefits  have  not  been  realized  either.  The  unsatisfactory  performance  of  the  M2, \nwhich  at  its  conception  was  considered  a  prime  candidate  for  private  sector  involvement,  is \nrooted in two factors: an alignment that is substantially longer than the competing national road \n\n                                                 \n9  Pakistan  Development \n\nForum \nwww.pakistan.gov.pk/PDF/index.jsp. \n\n10 To boost traffic, tolls were reduced 2 years after the opening of the M2. \n\n2007  Background  Briefs.

A business plan and a coordinating body that \ncould  have  brought  together  public  and  private  stakeholders  to  implement  it  would  have \nimproved development along the road.  \n \n\n6. \n\n External Assistance \n\nSince the inauguration of the NTCIP in 2005, the Government has interacted closely with \n29. \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies.  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation  (JBIC),  and  other  bilateral  financial  institutions  are  considering  assistance.  The \nWorld  Bank  is  processing  a  NTCIP  development  policy  loan.  Potential  projects  include  policy \nreform in rail, road, port and shipping services; trucking and trade facilitation; and civil aviation.  \n \n30. \nFor the road sector, Pakistan has received substantial assistance from ADB, JBIC, and \nWorld Bank (Appendix 4), since 2000. ADB\u2019s provincial project financial assistance began with \nSindh  (2001) 12 ,  Punjab  (2002) 13 ,  Baluchistan  (2003) 14 ,  and  North-West  Frontier  Province \n(2004).15 The  projects  concentrated  on  provincial  highways  and  farm-to-market  roads.  For  the \nBaluchistan and  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  projects,  ADB  financed  sections  of  the \nnational  highways  that  form  part  of  a  network  with  Afghanistan  and  associated  civil  works  for \nborder  facilities  at  Chaman  in  Baluchistan  (for  $3.5  million)  and  Torkham  in  NWFP  (for  $2.3 \nmillion). In 2005, a National Highway Development Sector Investment Program (NHDSIP) was \napproved for continued support for national highway development and regional connectivity.16 \n \nSince  2001,  JBIC  has  financed  the  construction  of  the  Kohat  Tunnel  for  a  total  of \n31. \n$79 million and the Indus Highway Construction Project (III) for $166 million. In 2001, the World \nBank  financed  the  Trade  and  Transport  Facilitation  Project  for  $3  million  and  the  Highway \nRehabilitation Project for $200 million in 2003. During the last 4 years (2003\u20132007), the Trade \nand Transport Facilitation Project has been actively assisting the Ministry of Communication to \nreview,  improve,  and  provide  institutional  capacity  building  for  all  major  agencies  associated \nwith the logistical chain. Under this project, the Government introduced a single administrative \ndocument  and  a  goods  declaration  form,  both  of  which  constitute  major  steps  toward  trade \nfacilitation.  The  World  Bank  is  preparing  a  project  to  follow  the  Trade  Facilitation  Project.  In \naddition, the National Logistics Cell, a government agency, is undertaking border improvements. \nPakistan Railways is authorized to move transit goods to Afghanistan. Overall, trade facilitation \nof  freight  traffic  is  adequately  covered  by  the  Government  and  the  World  Bank  project.  The \n\n                                                 \n11 Benefits accrue mainly to passenger cars that can drive at the allowable maximum speed of 120 km per hour. \n12 ADB.  2001.

Manila (RRP: PAK 36052, approved in 22 November, for $770,000,000) \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nWorld  Bank\u2019s  ongoing  Highway  Rehabilitation17 Project  focuses  on  about  856  km  of  highway \nimprovements along national highways N5 and M9 with implementation over 5 years.  \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n32. \nBefore 2000, ADB-financed road projects focused on local and regional farm-to-market \nneeds  with  only  selective  interventions  in  national  highways.  Subsequently,  ADB\u2019s  investment \nstrategy shifted toward general provincial rural access roads. Since 2002, the Government has \nsought  greater  integration  with  Pakistan\u2019s  international  neighbors,  so  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners have concentrated on improving the capacity and quality of essential road \nsections. Initially, ADB assistance was directed at road links with Afghanistan.  \n \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  supporting  the  road  sector  indicates  a  need  for:  (i)  advance \n33. \nprocurement of civil works and recruitment of supervising consultants; (ii) early establishment of \nproject implementation units (PIUs) with clear, unambiguous roles and responsibilities; (iii) strict \npre-qualification  criteria  for  contractors  and  supervising  consultants;  (iv)  advance  actions  and \nclose  monitoring  with  respect  to  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  relocation  of  utilities,  and \nclearance  of  rights-of  way;  and  (vi)  a  fast  disbursement  mechanism.  NHA  and  ADB  have \nworked  together  to  shorten  the  procurement  schedule  for  supervision  consultants  and  civil \nworks for the first batch of NHDSIP projects. However, approval for contract signing within the \nGovernment took 3 months and delayed mobilization. Coordination with all relevant government \nparties  is  the  key  for  fast  tracking  the  recruitment  process.  Recruitment  of  NHDSIP\u2019s  project \nmanager and support consultants was delayed, which resulted in a lack of coordination in the \nearly stages of project implementation. Establishing a project management unit with a full staff \nearly  on  is,  therefore,  crucial.  In  general,  a  clear  understanding  of  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  and  close  and  methodological  monitoring  by  the  executing  agency  is \nnecessary to ensure compliance with ADB policy. To assist the Government to implement the \nRoad Sector Development Framework and to prepare for subsequent tranches under the MFF, \nclose and frequent coordination by ADB staff will be essential.  \n \nThe  Pakistan  country  assessment  program  evaluation  (CAPE) 18 suggested  that  ADB \n34. \nshould continue supporting the transport sector. The CAPE findings support the current strategy \nof province-specific projects, increased use of MFFs, a network approach to road development \nrather  than  a  focus  on  selected  elements  of  the  network,  increased  emphasis  on  the  soft \ncomponents of road sector performance, and a strategy of fostering regional connectivity. The \nuse of MFFs allows for long-term engagement in the sector which supports reforms in tandem \nwith  flexible  timing  for  project  financing.  The  CAPE  further  recommends  that  ADB  should \nseparate  policy  conditions  and  soft  components  from  investment  projects.  Soft  components \nshould,  if  necessary  for  the  success  of  the  investment  project,  be  undertaken  first,  because  if \ntheir implementation is slow this may delay the implementation of the physical components and \ntherefore increase costs substantially during implementation. \n \n35.  Moreover,  the  sector  assessment  program  evaluation  (SAPE)19 for  the  Pakistan  road \nsector  suggested  the  following:  (i)  ways  must  be  found  to  address  the  defects  noted  in  the \nplanning and design of previous road projects, (ii) a sector road map needs to lay out a clear set \nof steps to be taken by the Government, ADB, and other development partners to improve road \nmaintenance;  (iii)  the  sector  road  map  should  include  a  time-bound  series  of  actions  that  the \n                                                 \n17 A World Bank-financed project, Highway Rehabilitation Project, approved on 10 November 2003, for $200 million. \n18 ADB. 2006.

The public and private sides \nof ADB must work together to help achieve this objective.

However,  evaluating  such  multinational \n\n36. \nSector  strategy.  ADB\u2019s focus has shifted from rural roads to major highways over the \npast 20 years. ADB\u2019s support for national highways in the country strategy and program update \nfor  Pakistan  (2005\u20132006) 20 concentrated  on  supporting  government  initiatives  to  strengthen \nsubregional  cooperation,  improve  cross-border  facilities  and  agreements,  strengthen  trade \nfacilitation,  and  enhance  transport  efficiency  in  the  main  transport  corridors.  Support  for \nsubregional  cooperation  and  cross-border  agreements  is  part  of  the  ADB-sponsored  Central \nand  South  Asian  Transport  and  Trade  Forum.21 The  World  Bank  has  also  undertaken  trade \nis \nfacilitation  activities \ncomplicated because it is often difficult to assign benefits to individual economies and to collect \nreliable  and  comparable  data.  For  its  part,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  also  initiated  a \nnumber  of  programs  to  meet  subregional  objectives.  ADB  has,  therefore,  shifted  its  strategy \ntoward assisting NHA to support of its overall plan to contribute to subregional connectivity. The \nongoing MFF for NHDSIP and this proposed MFF for the Program conform to this strategy.  \n \n37. \nIn  addition,  ADB  is  financing  technical  assistance  to  help  the  Government  formulate  a \nnational  transport  policy.  Such  a  policy  will  provide  a  stronger  strategic  direction  for  transport \ninfrastructure and an enabling environment for sustainable transport operation and financing.22 \nADB  has  also  worked  with  NHA  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  motorway  and \nnational  highway  investment,  operation,  and  maintenance.23 The  result  of  this  work  has  been \nused for smaller PPP projects and will be the basis for further assistance for a pilot project. \n \n38. \nIn  the  long  term,  the  shared  aim  of  the  Government  and  ADB  is  to  create  a  self-\nsustaining and efficient highway system that enables the people of Pakistan and their neighbors \nto  enjoy  greater  mobility  and  trade  at  the  lowest  possible  cost.  ADB  strategy  is,  therefore,  to \ncontinue  to  fill  financing  gaps  in  road  development  and  to  emphasize  institution  building  and \npolicy  reform  as  these  are  linked  to  the  sustainability  of  investments  and  to  better  economic \nreturns. Since there is potential large-scale lending for the highway system, ADB will continue to \nadopt  a  programmatic 24  approach,  and  projects  will  be  developed  in  a  sequential  and \nprogressive manner together with support components.  \n \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2005.

The loans are designed as investment projects but with the policy reform elements to be implemented in a \nsystematic, sequential, and coherent manner. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n9. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n39. \nADB  has  been  engaged  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  NHA  since  2001 \nand  has  provided  loans  and  technical  assistance  in  support  of  critical  policy  and  institutional \nreforms.  Following  extensive  policy  dialogue,  agreement  was  reached  on  a  road  sector \ndevelopment  framework  (RSDF)  in  2005  for  NHDSIP.  It  contains  recommendations  for  major \npolicy  reforms  and  sets  implementation  target  dates  in  five  policy  areas:  (i)  promulgating  the \nnational  transport  policy;  (ii)  facilitating  PPPs  in  road  construction,  maintenance,  and  toll \ncollection;  (iii)  developing  the  NHA  as  an  institution  and  improving  its  strategic  focus;  \n(iv) embedding concern for road safety in decision making; and (v) ensuring sustainable funding \nof  road  maintenance.  Significant  progress  continues  to  be  made  on  the  major  policy  and \ninstitutional issues targeted in the RSDF.  \n \n40. \nThe  RSDF  has  been  updated  to  include  additional  policy  milestones  for  the  Program \n(Appendix  5).  Using  lessons  learned  from  NHDSIP  and  other  projects  with  NHA,  additional \ncapacity-building  measures  have  been  added.  The  RSDF\u2019s  objectives  have  been  reorganized \nunder  (i)  sustainability,  (ii)  accountability  and  transparency  of  NHA,  (iii)  efficient  service \nprovision  by  NHA,  (iv)  highway  safety,  (v)  safeguards,  and  (vi)  private  sector  participation  in \nNHA roads. The progress against the policy reform milestones in the RSDF will be reviewed as \npart of the review process for all individual periodic financing requests (PFRs) scheduled to be \ncompleted  before  30 June  2013.  To  implement  the  RSDF,  NHA  will  be  assisted  by  NHDSIP \nconsultants and additional support has been included in the Program. Implementation of the key \nelement of the RSDF has been agreed with the Government to be assurances for the Program. \n \n\na. \n\nSustainability of Road Sector (Road Funding) \n\n \n41. \nShort-term  financial  sustainability  for  NHA  can  be  achieved  through  government \nendorsement of (i) a 5-year business plan and (ii) a 5-year maintenance plan (RSDF M251-1, 1-\n2).  The  business  plan  should  include  an  investment  plan,  financial  forecasts,  and  a  budget. \nAlthough the grant for highway maintenance has been increased by the Government, the actual \namount  allocated  cannot  be  predicted  under  the  current  system  of  annual  allocations. \nGovernment  endorsement  of  the  business  and  maintenance  plans  will  assure  allocations  and \nallow  for  further  detailed  planning.  In  addition,  NHA  is  unable  to  service  its  accumulated  cash \ndevelopment loans. The resolution of these debts is being discussed with the Government and \na decision on the available options is expected by September 2008 (RSDF M1-3).  \n \nA  national  transport  policy  is  being  developed  with  technical  assistance  provided  by \n42. \nADB.26 The policy will establish the foundations for the long-term sustainability of the transport \nsector.  The  overriding  objective  will  be  to  improve  economic  welfare  by  providing  transport \nservices at minimal cost. Other objectives relate to equity (including poverty alleviation), safety, \nand  environmental  and  strategic  considerations.  The  general  principle  of  the  policy  is  that \noperations and  services  should  be  left  to  the  private  sector  except  in  cases  where  the  private \nmarket fails and government intervention in some form may be appropriate. Other principles in \nthe  draft  national  transport  policy  include:  (i)  competition  within  and  between  modes  should \ngenerally  be  encouraged;  (ii)  minimum  pricing  (setting  fares  and  charges)  at  marginal  cost \nshould be the aim; (iii) there should be clear separation between the entity responsible for policy \nand  regulation  and  the  operations  or  executive  entity;  and  (iv)  investments  should  be \n                                                 \n25 This is in reference to the milestones set in the Road Sector Development Framework.

The policy should be approved by the Government (RSDF M1-6) by  December 2012 \nfor  implementation  in  line  with  the  national  transport  policy.  Because  the  revenues  from  toll \ncharges will be limited, a new study28 is needed to examine the current set of road-user charges \nand  to  make  recommendations  that  will  enable  some  of  the  income  from  the  charges  to  be \nallocated  to  NHA. 29 The  timing  of  this  study  will  depend  on  the  Government\u2019s  decision  on \nwhether  to  pursue  road-user  charges.  The  Government  will  determine  and  adopt  policies  to \nensure the financial sustainability of NHA by December 2009 (RSDF M1-7). \n \n\nb. \n\nAccountability and Transparency of NHA \n\n \n\nc. \n\nEfficient Service Provider \n\n \n44. \nRoad  users  and  taxpayers  should  have  a  role  in  reviewing  the  needs,  priorities,  and \neffectiveness of road system management. NHA has been improving its disclosure and public \naccountability practices. Financial, performance, and commercial audit reports and information \non procurement will need to be disclosed to stakeholders. A management information system is \nbeing  procured  to  improve  transparency  and  accountability.  A  website  to  enable  reporting  of \ngrievances  has  been  functioning  since  30  June  2007  (RSDF  M2-1).  A  review  of  key \nperformance  indicators  and  reporting  mechanisms  for  NHA  will  be  undertaken  to  clarify  how \naccountability  can  be  strengthened.  Standard  operating  procedures  will  be  adopted  in \naccordance with the new indicators by December 2009 (RSDF M2-2). The qualifications in the \nauditor\u2019s  letter  for  the  audited  financial  statements  of  NHA  will  be  addressed  and  rectified  by \nSeptember 2008 (RSDF M2-3). \n \n \n \nNHA  is  in  the  process  of  transforming  itself  into  a  service-driven  organization  with  a \n45. \nstrong  service  base.  A  network  optimization  plan  is  being  developed  with  the  help  of  ADB \n(footnote 16). Revisions to the guidelines for network planning will be made by July 2008 (RSDF \nM3-1). \n \n46. \nNHA  has  outsourced  an  increasing  number  of  functions  to  the  private  sector. \nPerformance-based concession contracts for operation and management should be in place by \nMarch  2010  (RSDF  M3-3).  To  alleviate  overloading,  more  weighing  stations  will  be  built, \nincorporating  storage  spaces  with off-loading  facilities.  Portable  weighing  stations will  be  used \nwhere  heavy  construction  temporarily  increases  truck  traffic.  ADB  will  consider  providing \nfinancial support for such initiatives.  \n \nNHA needs to attract, develop, and keep talented staff. A human resource policy based \n47. \non  performance  indicators,  evaluation,  and  compensation  will  be  formulated  and  adopted  by \nDecember 2009 (RSDF M3-4).

Such  charges  should  reflect  the  relative \ncontributions of different vehicle categories to congestion, environmental pollution, or road damage. NHA would be \ngiven access to a portion of such charges. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nd. \n\nRoad Safety on the National Highway Network \n\n \n48. \nNHA has established clear responsibility for a national highway safety program and for \ncloser  liaison  with  the  National  Highway  and  Motorway  Police.  A  road  safety  unit  has  been \nestablished  in  NHA.  Under  the  NWFP  Road  Development  Sector  and  Connectivity  Project \n(footnote 15), the National Highway and Motorway Police is undertaking a pilot safety study on \nsample sections of the national highway. An action plan acceptable to ADB in response to the \npilot study\u2019s recommendations will be prepared by December 2008 (RSDF M4-2). \n \n\ne. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n49. \nThe  Government  has  identified  land  acquisition  as  a  cause  of  project  delays  and  cost \nescalations. Careful monitoring of compliance with ADB safeguard policies will be needed in the \npreparation and implementation of land acquisition and resettlement plans and an environment \nimpact assessment that is acceptable to ADB. By December 2007, NHA will establish a unit with \na  dedicated  general  manager  and  adequate  staffing  for  environmental  and  social  safeguards. \nPreliminary land acquisition and resettlement and environmental assessment guideline for NHA \nheadquarters will be adopted by June 2008 (RSDF M5-1). Guidelines for regional offices and for \ncoordinating with local government entities will be adopted by November 2008 (RSDF M5-2). \n \n\nf. \n\nEnhancing Private Participation \n\n \n50. \nThe Government intends to improve the enabling environment for private participation in \ninfrastructure, supported by a cluster of ADB program loans that will help to establish the overall \npolicy  framework  and  reforms. 30  Previous  ADB  technical  assistance 31  has  helped  NHA  to  \n(i)  revise  a  draft  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in  national \nhighways,  motorways,  tunnels,  and  bridges  (to  be  confirmed  by  the  cabinet  committee  for \ninvestments);  (ii)  prepare  an  action  plan  to  improve  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \nprivate  sector  participation;  (iii)  develop  comprehensive  PPP  tender  documents  for  future \nprojects; (iv) undertake a preliminary review and improvement of NHA\u2019s proposed build-operate-\ntransfer projects over the next 5 years; and (v) review the institutional arrangements needed to \ncarry out PPP projects, including creating a PPP cell at NHA. \n \n51. \nADB is also helping to finance two of the proposed PPP pilot projects (footnote 23). ADB \nassistance  will  cover  identification  of  projects,  preparation  of  projects  for  bidding,  and \nnegotiation of contracts. The consultants have been selected. A full review of the current PPP \nfinancing plan is expected by 31 March 2008 (RSDF M6-1). NHA is targeting bidding of the ADB \nPPP  pilot  projects  by  September  2008  (RSDF  M6-2).  Based  on  the  experience  of  the  pilot \nprojects,  a  revised  pipeline  of  PPP  projects  is  targeted  to  be  available  by  December  2008 \n(RSDF M6-3). Such projects will require expected financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) that \nare sufficiently attractive to the private sector. \n \n52. \nNHA  is  considering  how  projects  with  less  attractive  FIRRs  or  untested  revenue \nforecasts  may  be  financed.  ADB  may  consider  assistance  for  these  projects  through  either \nloans for equity contribution by NHA or guarantees.  \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB.  2006.

The impact of the Program will be trade growth, and the \noutcome will be a more efficient NTC highway network. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n54. \nThe Program will have two components: (i) investment projects covering over 346 km of \nthe NTC highway network to be funded through two tranches, and (ii) program support focusing \non institutional strengthening of NHA. The proposed program is consistent with the CAPE and \nSAPE  recommendations  that  ADB  should  adopt  a  network  investment  approach  and  continue \nsupport for policy reforms and institutional strengthening (paras. 34\u201335). An MFF  will be used \nso tranches can be prepared as projects become ready for implementation. The roads selected \n(new,  expansion,  or  existing  roads)  will  be  in  the  main  backbone  of  the  NTC  (Peshawar\u2013\nKarachi) and those providing connections to the PRC and to the seaport in Gwadar. Technical \nassistance  will  also  be  provided  in  conjunction  with  the  Program  to  develop  an  NTC  highway \nbusiness  plan  for  the  pilot  section  of  the  Peshawar\u2013Khanewal  (M1-E4)  motorways  and \nexpressways and to enhance the economic and financial sustainability of the roads (paras. 95\u2013\n97). \n \n55. \nDepending  on  needs,  ADB  may  facilitate  financing  of  PPP  initiatives  through  the \nProgram by: (i) funding NHA\u2019s equity portion, (ii) guaranteeing any minimum traffic guarantee or \nannuity  given  by  NHA,  and  (iii)  providing  political  risk  guarantees  for  commercial  loans. \nProviding  equity  or  debt  to  a  project  company  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  window  will  be \nconsidered separately from the Program. \n \n56. \nThe Program will implement policy reform actions agreed with NHA and the Government \nin  the  RSDF  (paras.  39\u201340).  Policy  reforms  to  be  undertaken  during  the  later  phase  (2012\u2013\n2017)  will  include  a  review  of  the  outcomes  from  the  first  phase,  updating  the  RSDF,  and \nformulating the next generation of reforms. \n\n \n1. \n\nRoad Investment \n\n \nThe  Government  has  asked  ADB  for  support  in  building  new  roads  and  expanding \n57. \nexisting roads to achieve the goals set out in the National Trade Corridor Investment Program. \nSome  of  the  highways  will  be  funded  through  the  ongoing  NHDSIP  (footnote  16)  and \nexpressways  and  motorways  through  the  Program.  NHA  has  prepared  two  projects  under \ntranche 1: (i) the Peshawar\u2013Torkham section 1 (E-1), and (ii) the Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal section \n(E-4).  The  total  length  of  these  two  sections  is  218  km.  NHA  has  finalized  preparatory  works, \nincluding \nland  acquisition,  and \nresettlement  assessments;  detailed  engineering  designs;  and  bidding  documents.  NHA  has \nprepared the procurement plans and is proceeding with advanced action allowed by ADB.  \n \n58. \nThe  proposed  projects  are  the  construction  of  four-lane  highways  with  partially  limited \naccess for section 1 of E-1 and E-4. Full-depth asphalt pavement, long-span bridges, flyovers, \nand  interchanges  will  be  constructed  in  both  projects.  There  will  be  significant  earthworks  for \nsection  1  of  E-1  as  it  crosses  a  mountainous  area.  Fewer  earthworks  are  expected  on  the \nrelatively flat terrain for the E-4 project.  \n\ntraffic  and  economic  analyses;  environmental,  social, \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n59. \nThree  projects  for  tranche  2,  totaling  about  125  km,  are  being  prepared  by  NHA.  Due \ndiligence will be conducted by ADB when preparatory works have been completed. The criteria \nfor  selecting  the  roads  for  tranche  2  and  other  additional  road  sections  during  implementation \nand the status of the preparatory work for the tranche 2 projects is in Appendix 6.  \n \n60. \nThe  Program  will  provide  vehicle  parking  and  service  areas  along  project  highway \ncorridors.  It  will  also  provide  equipment  to  control  pavement  overloading  by  domestic  and \ninternational  traffic.  This  component  will  include  serviced  parking  areas  and  wayside  facilities \nand  will  cover  consulting  services  for  design,  supervision,  and  civil  works.  The  facilities  to  be \nprovided  include  (i)  paved  parking,  (ii)  emergency  repairs,  (iii)  restaurants,  (iv)  refueling,  (v) \nprayer  areas,  (vi)  overnight  accommodation,  (vii)  weighing  stations,  (viii)  emergency  medical \nservices  (ix)  toll  plazas,  and  (x)  a  building  for  operations.  The  design  approach  and  technical \nstandards are in Supplementary Appendix A. The facilities will be leased out to private operators \non a long-term basis or developed through PPPs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\nis  considering \n\nfinancing  options \n\nThe  Government \n\n \n61. \nInstitutional  strengthening  will  be  continued  in  line  with  the  RSDF.  The  design  of \ninterventions has taken into account ongoing and planned support from ADB and other bilateral \nand  multilateral  financial  institutions  and  therefore  not  all  the  milestones  in  the  RSDF  are \ncovered.  Under  the  ongoing  NHDSIP,  NHA  has  established  a  policy  coordination  unit  to \ncoordinate and monitor progress on institutional and policy reforms. Outline terms of reference \nfor the components summarized below are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n62. \nfor  capital  development  and \nmaintenance  of  roads  (para.  39).  A  road  sector  policy  study  will  help  NHA  to  rationalize \nexpenditures and ensure stable and predictable revenues. It will also review road user charges \nshould the Government decide to pursue this option.  \n \n63. \nThe  Program  has  several  components  designed  to  help  NHA  become  an  efficient \nservice provider (paras. 45\u201347). Road corridor management using performance-based contracts \nhas improved road maintenance practices in many countries and the Program will support NHA \nto  determine  the  model  best  suited  for  Pakistan.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  a  pilot \napplication of performance-based contracts on a road to be selected during the study. Efficient \nmanagement  will  be  promoted  through  intelligent  transport  systems  such  as  card  readers  and \nelectronic notification. Portable weighing stations will be piloted to control overloading of trucks \nat temporary locations such as construction sites.  \n \n64. \nIf  NHA  is  to  become  an  efficient  service  provider,  it  will  need  highly  motivated  and \nqualified staff. Consultants will develop a human resource development strategy. Proposals will \nbe made for work performance indicators for units and departments and for advanced training \nand education to upgrade the skills of staff.  \n \nAs  part  of  the  ongoing  NHDSIP,  a  core  team  of  experts  has  been  funded  for  a  2-year \n65. \nperiod for capacity development, project management, contract management, and safeguards. \nThe  services  of  these  consultants  will  be  extended  for  another  3  years  under  the  Program, \nfurther  strengthening  NHA\u2019s  capacity  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  the  projects.  To \nencourage quality at entry, the Government has requested funding for project preparation. The \nconsultants will prepare feasibility studies and detailed designs using the latest technologies for \nalignment selection and construction. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n66. \nNHA established unit for environmental and social safeguards under NHDSIP. These will \nbe  upgraded  and  a  dedicated  general  manager  assigned,  with  adequate  support  staff.  A \nmethodical approach will be taken to building capacity and maintaining sustainability (para 42). \nCapacity  development  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  NHDSIP  has  been \nredesigned  to  utilize  the  funds  to  fit  the  current  needs  of  NHA,  and  a  detailed  assessment  of \ncurrent  bottlenecks  will  be  carried  out  to  enable  the  unit  to  become  efficient  and  effective. \nFunding from the Program will help to eliminate these bottlenecks and to improve coordination \nbetween NHA headquarters and regional offices and among NHA, the boards of revenue in the \nfour  project  provinces,  and  local  governments  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and \nindigenous  people \nfor  environmental \nissues  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  Guidelines \nassessment will be adopted by June 2008. \n \nC. \n \n67. \nThe projects proposed under the Program cover key sections of the NTC. The Program \nis divided into tranches, with tranche 1 covering two projects and the institutional strengthening \ncomponent.  The  following  criteria  were  used  to  identify  the  projects:  (i)  technical  justification,  \n(ii)  economic  viability,  and  (iii)  minimal  environmental  and  social  impacts  (Appendix  7).  These \ncriteria will be applied to all subsequent tranches.  \n \nD. \n\nTechnical Justification and Selection Criteria \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n68. \nThe total cost of NTC highway investment plan is $5.36 billion. The financing plan is a \ncombination of funds from the Government, ADB, and other financiers. It was agreed that NHA \nwould provide at least 20% from its own resources and that ADB could fund up to 80% of the \ntotal cost for components under each tranche (Table 2). \n \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment \nADB \nOther IFIs or BFIs \nOther \nTotal \n\nTable 2: National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan \n \n\nProgram \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n210 \n890 \n \n \n1,100 \n\nShare  \n(%) \n20 \n80 \n \n \n100 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n1,632 a \n1,082 b \n1,547  \n1,102 \n5,363 \n\nShare  \n(%) \n30 \n20 \n29 \n21 \n100 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IFI = international financial institutions, BFI = bilateral financial institutions, \nProgram = National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program.  \na The Government component for NTC includes roads to be financed by the Water and Power Development \n\nAuthority. \n\nb About 16.6% from the Program and 3.4% from NHDSIP. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and National Highway Authority estimates. \n\n \n69. \nThe  Government  has  requested  funds  up  to  the  equivalent  of  $900  million  to  help \nfinance  part  of  the  NTC  highway  investment  plan  for  motorways  and  expressways.  This  is  in \naddition to $175 million proposed to be allocated to highways from the NHDSIP. The financing \nwill be provided under an MFF in accordance with ADB policy.32 The implementation period will \nbe 10 years. The MFF will consist of individual loans subject to the submission of a related PFR \nby  the  Government  and  execution  of  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  has \n\n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nentered  into  a  framework  financing agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  loans  under  the  MFF  will \nfinance civil works, equipment and goods, and consulting services. The Government will make \nthe proceeds of the loans available to NHA upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nADB  will  use  its  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  to  finance  the  projects  up  to  a \n70. \nmaximum amount of $890 million. Each loan will have a repayment period of 25 years, including \na grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London inter-\nbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%,  conversion \noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the ordinary operations for loan \nregulations, and such other terms set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The foreign \nexchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  the  borrower.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  and  (ii) an \nundertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  did  not  rely  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n71. \nThe  support  component  (institutional  strengthening)  amounting  to  $12.5  million  will  be \nfunded by ADB in the amount of $10.0 million equivalent (80%) through its Asian Development \nFund  (ADF)  resources.  The  terms  and  conditions  will  include  interest  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter and a repayment  period of 32 \nyears  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  the \nborrower.  The  borrower  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  NHA  upon  terms  and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n72. \nThe first PFR to ADB for tranche 1 is for $555 million, comprising a loan of $545 million \nfrom OCR to finance two projects and a loan from ADF resources of $10 million equivalent to \nfinance the support component (Table 3). The first PFR has been prepared by the Government \nand  is  presented  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  together  with  this  document  and  the  FFA.  The \ncost of the two projects identified under tranche 1 is estimated at 2007 current prices to be $709 \nmillion. The Government and NHA requested ADB to finance up to 77% of the total cost which \namounts to $545 million. The remaining portion will be met by a government allocation to NHA. \nThe cost estimates per project are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n\nTable 3: National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program Financing Plan Tranche 1 \n($ million) \n \n\nTranche 1 \n\n \n\nItem \n\n                  OCR                                            ADF \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n      545  \n       164  \n       709 \n\nShare \n(%) \n77 \n23 \n100 \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n10.0  \n       2.0  \n       12.0  \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, Program = National Trade \nCorridor Highway Investment Program, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n\nShare \n(%) \n80 \n20 \n100 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nThe Executing and Implementing Agencies \n\nNHA will be the executing agency and the implementing agency for the investment and \n73. \nsupport components. The proposed organization structures are in Appendix 9 and 10. An NTC \nHighway Investment Program coordinating committee chaired by the chairperson of NHA will be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  the  use  of  loan  funds  and  for  overall  implementation  performance. \nThe committee will meet at least quarterly. A policy formulation and coordination office headed \nby  the  NHA  member  for  planning  was  established  under  NHDSIP,  and  the  Program  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  under  the  NHA  member  for  operations  is  to  be  set  up  at  NHA \nheadquarters in Islamabad. A general manager for ADB projects in NHA headquarters has been \nappointed and is in place.  \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\nimplementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  For \n\nUnder  NHDSIP,  NHA  has  established  a  project  coordinating  committee  (PCC)  chaired \n74. \nby the chairperson of NHA to provide guidance on the overall implementation and performance \nof the project. NHA will introduce management information systems in the office of the general \nmanager (ADB) to manage the Program and other projects under its responsibility. A core team \nof  consultants  has  been  provided  under  the  NHDSIP  to  further  develop  capacity  for  project \npreparation and implementation. The general manager oversees all activities for ADB projects, \nincluding  preparing  projects,  writing  reports,  and  monitoring  implementation  of  on-going \nprojects.  A  principal  coordination  officer  has  been  assigned  to  the  general  manager  to \ncoordinate work being done in different departments of NHA. A safeguard unit is responsible for \nthe  processing  and \nthe \nimplementation of the E-4, a project management unit is located in the field (near Faisalabad) \nand  a  general  manager  and  principal  coordinating  officer  will  directly  control  and  monitor  the \nproject. Project directors for each package head their respective PIUs. For section 1 of E-1, the \ngeneral  manager  for  ADB  projects  in  NWFP  will  head  the  project  management  unit  and  will \nhave  a  project  director  who  will  head  the  PIU.  Project  directors  will  be  supported  by  deputy \nproject  directors  and  adequate  support  staff  as  per  NHA\u2019s  standard  complement  (NHA  will \nprovide  such  information  to  ADB).  The  supervising  consultant  for  construction  will  assist  the \nPIU. Each PIU will be adequately staffed and working at least 2 months before the award of civil \nworks contracts.  \n \nIndependent  teams  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  provided  for  each \n75. \ncivil  works  contract  (supervision  consultants)  and  they  will  be  headed  by  chief  resident \nengineers. Each team will report to the assigned project director or general manager. NHA will \nbe provided with the necessary expertise from the consulting team supervising construction or \nfrom  NHA  staff  resources  for  projects  involving  land  acquisition,  resettlement  activities,  and \nenvironmental impacts. An accountant or administrative specialist will be assigned to each PIU. \nThe  team  will  provide  NHA  with  periodic  reports  on  the  progress  of  the  project,  including \nsafeguard  issues.  Sufficient  administrative  authority  will  be  delegated  to  the  PIUs  for  effective \nand timely project implementation. \n \n76. \nFor subsequent tranches, NHA will appraise all projects and will be responsible for their \npreparation  and  implementation.  Appraisal,  processing,  and  implementation  will  include  the \ndevelopment and completion of technical reports (feasibility studies, preliminary design reports, \nenvironmental  assessment  reports,  resettlement  and  indigenous  people  development  plans, \nand  detailed  design  reports)  to  ensure  compliance  with  government  and  ADB  requirements. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nPFRs will be submitted to ADB when they have been approved by NHA and have received the \nrequired government clearances (PC-1s). Detailed timetables for implementation will be set out \nin the facility administration memorandum.  \n \nNHA will submit progress reports to ADB every quarter. Environmental checklists will be \n77. \ncompleted as an early warning system for projects that are environmental or social category A \nor B. NHA will submit other required performance and monitoring reports twice a year. Overall \nprogress and compliance with conditions of the FFA and individual loan and project agreements \nwill  be  monitored  regularly,  with  periodic  reports  to  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project \nimplementation  requirements.  Reports  will  include  evaluations  of  issues  or  problems  faced  by \nNHA  and  will  recommend  remedial  actions.  Overall  progress  will  be  considered  as  new \nfinancing requests are submitted.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n78. \nThe  Program  will  be  implemented  over  10  years  (inclusive  of  procurement  and \nconstruction  activities)  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  31  August  2017.  The  loan \nagreements are expected to have implementation periods of 3\u20136 years. The last PFR should be \nsubmitted no later than 30 June 2013. Civil works are expected to be bid out in two tranches. \nThe tranche 1 projects are at an advanced stage of preparation, and mobilization of consultants \nto  supervise  construction  and  civil  works  is  expected  to  begin  in  July  2008.  For  tranche  2 \nprojects,  NHA  will  develop  detailed  implementation  plans  when  it  submits  the  PFR.  The \nimplementation  schedule  will  allow  for  the  acquisition  of  land  free  from  encumbrances;  for \nresettlement; for clearance of all utilities; and for trees from the land to be used for construction. \nFor  the  support  component,  implementation  will  be  staged  from  2008  to  2014.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n79. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payment  procedures  will  generally  be  used  for \nlarge civil works contracts and consulting services. NHA will establish imprest accounts for the \ninvestment  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan,  with  an  initial  advance  equivalent  to  estimated \neligible project expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is less. \nThe  imprest  accounts  (one  for  each  OCR  and  ADF  loan)  will  be  established,  managed,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nagreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  account  for  any \nindividual payment under $100,000 for the OCR loan and $50,000 for the ADF loan.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n80. \nADB Management has approved a request for advance contracting for procuring goods \nand services for each tranche. The Government has also requested retroactive financing of up \nto 20% of the loan amount for each tranche under the Program. ADB Management has agreed \nto  seek  Board  approval  for  retroactive  financing  provided  that  expenditures  are  in  accordance \nwith  agreed  procedures  and  they  took  place  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding  individual  loan  agreement  under  the  MFF.  Retroactive  financing  is  sought  for \neligible expenditures, including civil works, goods, and consulting services. Such financing will \nbe  subject  to  compliance  with  any  involuntary  resettlement  requirements  stated  in  a  project \nresettlement plan. Furthermore, NHA has been informed that approval of advanced contracting \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nand  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  of  the  proposed  projects.  The \nprocurement department in NHA will mainly be responsible for the advance action. PIUs will be \nestablished for each project.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProcurement \n\n81. \nProcurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  To  ensure  competition,  international  competitive  bidding  contract  packages  will  be \nencouraged.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding \namong pre-qualified bidders. Civil works contracts with an estimated value less than $5 million \nwill  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  through  ADB\u2019s  standard  prequalification \nprocedure. Supply contracts will use limited international bidding for contracts with an estimated \nvalue of $100,000\u2013$1,000,000, and shopping arrangements for contracts of less than $100,000. \nBefore  the  beginning  of  national  competitive  bidding  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will \nreview  the  Borrower's  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements. \nAny  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the  Borrower's  procedures  will  be  documented  in  the \nprocurement  plan. 33  Goods  in  excess  of  $1  million  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) in all bidding and contractual documents. \n \n82. \nThe  projects  in  the  two  tranches  will  involve  about  seven  international  competitive \nbidding  contract  packages  for  road  improvement  and  construction  civil  works.  The  packages \ntake into account the need for a balance between (i) minimizing administration by consolidating \nworks  in  larger  contracts,  and  (ii)  designing  package  sizes  that  will  enable  international \ncontractors  to  participate.  The  thresholds  for  each  type  of  procurement  plan  and  indicative \ncontract packages are in Appendix 12. Finalization of the civil works packages for tranche 2 will \nbe done during project implementation. Furthermore, to shorten processing, the bidding period \nhas been reduced to 45 days.34 \n \n83. \nIf ADB and the borrower later agree to adopt post-qualification procedures based on the \nsuccess  of  the  exercise  initiated  under  the  NHDSIP,  such  procedures  can  be  tried  for  some \ntranche  2  packages.  If  a  post-qualification  procedure  is  adopted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines,  no  prior  review  and  approval  will  be  required;  however,  ADB  will  review  the \nprocurement  documents  and  respond  as  soon  as  practicable  but  no  later  than  6  months  after \ntheir receipt.  \n \n\n7. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n84. \nTranche  1  will  require  about  1,207  person-months  of  consulting  services  (128 \ninternational  and  1,079  national).  Tranche  2  will  require  about  1,080  person-months  (171 \ninternational  and  909  national);  however,  this  figure  will  be  finalized  during  implementation  of \ntranche 1. The consultants will help NHA to implement the Program. The terms of reference for \nall  loan-financed  consultants  will  be  subject  to  prior  ADB  approval.  International  consultants \nrecruited as consulting firms will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \n\n                                                 \n33 ADB. 2006.

Individual international and national consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n85. \nFor  tranche  1  projects,  two  ADB-financed  consulting  firms  will  support  bidding  and \nsupervising  of  the  construction  of  civil  works  for  highway  improvements.  The  consultants  will \nhelp with supervising construction of the four civil works packages. Terms of reference for the \nconsultants  for  tranche  2  projects  will  be  finalized  during  the  implementation  of  tranche  1. \nDetailed engineering design and feasibility studies for tranche 2 projects are being undertaken \nby  locally  recruited  consultants  and  financed  from  NHA  resources.  Consulting  services \npackages  are  summarized  in  Appendix  12  and  an  outline  of  the  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants supervising construction is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n  \nIn  addition  to  recruiting  consultants  through  firms,  NHA  will  engage  the  following \n86. \nindividual consultants to provide project management support: (i) a local resettlement specialist \nto  review  resettlement  plans  for  all  projects  and  to  train  NHA  staff  to  strengthen  capacity  for \noverall  planning  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities;  (ii)  an \ninternational  social  monitoring  specialist  for  independent  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting \non the progress of land acquisition and resettlement activities (Supplementary Appendix C); (iii) \nan  international  environmental  expert  to  oversee  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002)  and  safeguard  measures  for  all  projects;  and  (iv)  a  contract  specialist  to  help  NHA \nengage consultants and procure civil works.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n87. \nwith  the  Government  and  NHA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate either directly or through \nits  agents  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  projects \nunder the Program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nare  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of NHA and all contractors, suppliers, and \nconsultants and other service providers. \n \n88. \nThe  independent  audit  of  the  NHA  financial  statements  and  the  Road  Maintenance \nAccount  has  been  a  notable  step  in  promoting  transparency  and  governance.  Annual  public \nconsultations  have  taken  place  on  the  road  maintenance  plan.  A  grievance  website  has  been \nestablished  to  enable  anonymous  or  signed  complaints.  A  policy  coordination  unit  has  been \nestablished to assist with the implementation of agreed reforms. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\na. \n\nAccounts and External Audit \n\nNHA  shall  maintain  its  financial  statements  in  double  entry  accrual  accounting  in \n89. \naccordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  followed  in  Pakistan. 35  Its \nfinancial  statements  shall  comprise  its  balance  sheet,  income  statement,  and  cash  flow \n\n                                                 \n35 Where  for  any  particular  disclosure  the  prevailing  accounting  standard  in  Pakistan  differs  from  the  International \n\nFinancial Reporting Standard, the financial statements shall, in a note to the accounts, explain the divergence. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nstatement  accompanied  by  their  respective  schedules  and  notes  to  accounts  as  may  be \nnecessary.  NHA\u2019s \nin  accordance  with \nfinancial  statements  shall  be  audited  annually \nInternational  Standards  of  Auditing  by  an  external  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  NHA  annual \nfinancial  statement  shall  be  accompanied  by  the  auditors\u2019  letter  to  NHA  management  and \nmanagement\u2019s response to it. Most importantly, NHA\u2019s external auditors\u2019 report will contain the \nauditors\u2019 opinion on whether ADB\u2019s loan funds were used for the purposes specified in ADB\u2019s \nloan  and  project  agreements.  NHA  will  submit  to  ADB  its  audited  annual  reports  in  English \nwithin 6 months of the close of every financial year. \n \n90. \nNHA will maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures \nincurred for the project and use of local funds. These project accounts and financial statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. External auditors for the projects will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  (2007, as amended from time to time). The audit of the \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditure will be carried out as part of the regular annual \naudit.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  the  examination  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of \nexpenditure  should  be  separately  set  out  in  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  NHA  will  submit  to  ADB  the \naudited project annual reports in English within 6 months of the close of every financial year. \n \n\nb. \n\nInternal Audit \n\n91. \nNHA has an internal audit department headed by a general manager. The remainder of \nthe  staff  consists  of  a  director,  two  deputy  directors,  four  assistant  directors  and  a  junior \naccounting  and  audit  member  of  staff.  The  eventual  staff  size  is  40  but  not  all  positions  have \nbeen  filled.  NHA\u2019s  internal  audit  department  general  manager,  deputy  director  and  assistant \ndirectors  are  seconded  from  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  (the  country\u2019s \nsupreme  audit  institution).  The  director  is  seconded  from  the  Income  Tax  Department.  NHA\u2019s \ninternal audit department reports to its chairperson. Any abnormalities detected by the internal \naudit department are forwarded to the concerned operational general manager and the internal \naudit  department  recommendations  are  followed  up  by  the  compliance  committee  established \nwithin NHA. The internal audit department audits NHA twice a year and coordinates efforts with \nthe external auditor. With the help of consultants, it is preparing an internal audit manual that is \nexpected  to  be  ready  in  6  months.  Overall,  NHA\u2019s  internal  audit  system  appears  to  be \nsatisfactory and commensurate with its role as an EA. \n \n\nc. \n\nInvestment Program Performance and Monitoring Report \n\n92. \nQuarterly  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  for  individual  projects  for  review  by  ADB. \nNHA  has  been  developing  a  systematic  investment  program  performance  monitoring  and \nanalysis system, integrated with its management information system for NHDSIP. Baseline data \nfor performance monitoring have been established and are being refined. They will be applied to \nProgram. The key indicators and assumptions outlined at the impact and outcome levels in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  will  be  used  for  rapid  assessment.  The  policy \ncoordination  unit  is  monitoring  progress  on  the  road  sector  development  framework  and  will \ncontinue  to  report  on  progress  as  part  of  the  periodic  reports.  The  procurement  schedule  for \nconsultancy services under the support component and progress reports by the consultants will \nbe closely monitored by the policy coordination unit. \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n10. \n\nInvestment Program Review  \n\n93. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  first  loan  approval.  The \nmission  will  review  implementation  and  operations,  including  resettlement  and  environmental \naspects,  based  on  quarterly  progress  reports.  Subsequent  missions  will  meet  with  the \nGovernment and NHA twice a year to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review will \nbe  carried  out  2  years  after  each  loan  becomes  effective.  This  will  focus  on  the  engineering, \nresettlement,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  of  ADB-supported  investments  and  will  also \nreview the financial status of NHA. Representatives of ADB and NHA will take part in the review. \nThe midterm reviews will evaluate compliance with warranties and representations contained in \nthe FFA and with assurances in individual loan agreements. The review will allow for any mid-\ncourse  corrections  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and  the  achievement  of  objectives.  A \nproject  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  individual \nprojects.  A  completion  report  will  be  prepared  after  the  completion  of  all  ADB-supported \nactivities and projects under the Program. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n94. \nA technical assistance grant will be provided to develop a pilot highway business plan for \nthe E1-E4 (Peshawar\u2013Khanewal) road. The impact and outcome of the TA is consistent with the \nProgram  (para.  53)  and  will  help  to  maximize  the  benefits  from  the  NTC.  A  team  of  business \nconsultants will be hired to (i) identify industries that would be attracted to particular areas along \nthe road in line with existing spatial plans (if any) and in consultation with the private sector; (ii) \ndraft recommendations for government action (e.g., on infrastructure and incentives needed) to \nattract  priority  sectors,  and  (iii)  develop  a  marketing  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The \nconsultants will work in concert with the NTC strategy being developed with ADB support, which \nwill establish a strategic framework for new business development along the NTC. \n \nCost  and  Financing.  The  total  cost  of  the  technical  assistance  is  estimated  to  be \n95. \n$650,000 equivalent. ADB has been asked by Government to provide $500,000 equivalent. The \nTA  will  be  financed  on  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will \nprovide $150,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities and other expenditures.  \n \n96. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  Input  from  private  and  public  stakeholders  will  be \nessential  if  the  business  plan  is  to  be  successful.  An  NTC  development  body  with \nrepresentatives  from  the  private  sector  (e.g.,  business  groups  and  chambers  of  commerce), \ngovernment agencies, and academia will be formed under the Planning Commission to develop \nand implement the recommendations from the technical assistance grant. The executing agency \n(EA)  will  be  the  Planning  Commission  headed  by  the  member  for  infrastructure.  The  TA  is \nexpected to engage international consultants for 11 person-months and national consultants for \n15 person-months. Consulting services will be recruited through ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nor  quality-based  selection  procedures  and  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  In \naddition,  individual  expertise  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  The  TA  is \nexpected to begin in September 2008 and completed by January 2009.  \n \n\nV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Program Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\n97. \nThe Program is designed to increase trade growth by making road traffic along the NTC \nmore  efficient.  Increased  competitiveness  will  contribute  to  greater  GDP  growth  and  enhance \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nemployment  opportunities.  The  road  projects  will  provide  employment  for  skilled  and  unskilled \nlabor during their implementation.  \n \nB. \n\nOverall Economic Analysis \n\n98. \nThe urban centers of Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad\u2013Rawalpindi are the main origins \nand  destinations  for  domestic  trade  and  attract  over  33%  of  traded  goods.  The  north\u2013south \nroads have played a significant role in accommodating increases in freight movement.  \n \n99. \nUnder  a  \u201cdo-minimum\u201d  scenario  where  the  ongoing  road  works  and  other  rehabilitation \nworks were taken into account, the vehicle and capacity ratios of N5 road sections in 2015 were \nestimated at about 0.7 or above which is theoretically reaching road capacity. The \u201cdo-minimum\u201d \nwas  compared  with  a  \u201cwith  development\u201d  case  in  which  all  the  proposed  works  in  the  NTC \nhighway investment plan were included. The total financial cost of about 3,700 km of roads was \nestimated  at  PRs264  billion  (exclusive  of  land  acquisition  and  price  contingency).  It  is  assumed \nthat  this  expenditure  will  be  incurred  over  the  period  2008\u20132014.  Subsequent  increases  in \nmaintaining the road network were estimated at an average of PRs3.7 billion per year.  \n \n100.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the NTC highway investment plan overall \nis  estimated  at  39%.  To  begin  with  the  benefits  are  mainly  associated  with  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs but benefits from time savings grow over time. The total savings were estimated \nto average about PRs200 billion per year or about 3% of Pakistan\u2019s 2005 GDP. \n \n101.  Benefits accruing from savings in vehicle operating costs grow more slowly than benefits \nassociated with time savings. The underlying reason is that renewed congestion occurs toward \nthe end of the investment period (requiring a new round of capacity expansion at a later stage). \nThis  conclusion  was  supported  by  the  Pakistan  Transport  Plan  Study36 which  suggested  that \nplans for the motorway system should include two parallel north\u2013south motorways, one on each \nside of the Indus River. \n \n102.  A  preliminary  computable  general  equilibrium  model  was  used  to  estimate  the  indirect \nbenefits of the NTC highway investment plan for the economy. The indirect benefits were much \ngreater  than  the  direct  benefits.  Improvements  in  feeder  roads  to  the  NTC  highways  and \nproduction  and  logistics  hubs  along  the  highway  would  increase  the  distribution  of  benefits \nfurther to secondary cities and rural areas.  \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis for Tranche 1 Projects \n\n103.  The overall economic viability of NTC highways was estimated, taking into account the \noverall investment not only in the highways but in other investments currently in the pipeline. A \nsensitivity  test  was  performed  to  assess  the  worst-case  scenario  in  which  only  the  individual \nprojects  under  tranche  1  are  constructed.  Individual  project  evaluations  do  not  encompass  all \nthe benefits that overall network improvement would bring, such as a cleaner environment and \nfewer accidents (Appendix 13).  \n \n104.  Peshawar\u2013Torkham Section 1 (E-1). The project will provide an alternative route to the \nexisting \ntraffic  between  Peshawar  and  Afghanistan  and \nintermediate locations within Pakistan. A four-lane divided configuration that avoids urban areas \nwill  permit  higher  travel  speeds  and  will  include  road  safety  measures.  As  a  result,  vehicle \n                                                 \n36 Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2006. Pakistan Transport Plan Study. \n\ntwo-lane,  undivided  road \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\noperating  costs  and  travel  time  for  users  of  the  new  road  will  be  reduced.  The  new  road  will \nprobably divert about 60% of the traffic from the existing road. The substantial bus traffic will be \nsplit between the existing road and the new road. \n \n105.  Under the worst-case scenario, only this road is built. The EIRR was estimated at 11% \nand the project is only marginally viable because of the high capital cost. The likelihood that only \nthis  project  will  be  implemented  is  very  small,  given  that  both  sections  1  and  2  of  Peshawar\u2013\nTorkham (E-1)37 and all of Faisalabad-Khanewal (E-4) will be financed by ADB. Construction of \nthese sections (which will provide shorter connections between Peshawar and Multan) will result \nin higher benefits to society and an EIRR of 14%. \n \n106.  Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal  (E-4). The  project will provide an  alternative to several existing \nroutes  between  Faisalabad  and  the  Khanewal\u2013Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh  area.  The  existing  roads \nare narrow and congested more because of the vehicular characteristics of prevailing traffic (i.e. \nnon-motorized  vehicles)  rather  than  traffic  volume.  It  will  also  extend  the  E-1,  M-2,  and  M-3 \nmotorway network southward, thus offering a higher speed link for through traffic between the \nnorth of Pakistan and its neighbors to the north and northwest and to southern Punjab, Sindh, \nand the ocean ports of Pakistan.  \n \n107.  Traffic diverted to the new road will be able to travel at higher speeds. No account has \nbeen  taken  of  any  changes  in  the  distances  to  be  traveled  between  the  new  road  and  the \nexisting roads.  \n \n108.  E-4  provides  the  missing  link  between  the  existing  motorway  (M-1,  M-2,  and  M-3)  and \nthe  heart  of  Punjab  (Lodhran\u2013Sukkur,  N-5).  Under  the  worst-case  scenario  in  which  only  this \nroad is built, the project is economically viable given the estimated EIRR of 15%. It will generate \na  high  economic  return  even  with  pessimistic  assumptions  regarding  traffic  volume,  economic \ngrowth,  and  construction  costs.  These  results  do  not  include  benefits  from  reduced  traffic  on \nroads  from  which  traffic  is  diverted.  Such  reductions  would  relieve  congestion  and  reduce  the \nrate of road deterioration. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Management and Financial Analysis \n\n109.  A  financial  management  assessment  found  that  NHA  had  enough  capacity  to  fulfill \nADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements. Questionnaires and field interviews were used to review current \npractices. NHA is in transition, and the assessment was designed to determine its potential to \nachieve  greater  financial  and  operational  autonomy.  Accounting  diagnostic  tools  such  as  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  comprehensive  country  financial  accountability  assessment 38  and  public \nexpenditure review39 were used (Supplementary Appendix F).  \n \n110.  A  financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  investments  for  tranche  1  was  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB  (2005). All financial costs and benefits were expressed at constant \n2006 prices. Cost streams used to determine the FIRR (i.e., capital investment, operations and \n\n                                                 \n37 Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Section  2  will  be  implemented  under  batch  2  of  the  MFF  for  the  National  Highway \n\nDevelopment Sector Investment Program under preparation by NHA. \n\n38 World  Bank.  2003.

The  current  toll \nrate  was  used  to  estimate  revenue,  while  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were \ncharged for each year. \n \n111.  Calculated  using  conservative  traffic  estimates  and  current  toll  rates  as  a  basis  for \naffordability,  the  FIRR  for  section  1  of  E-1  and  E-4  compares  unfavorably  with  the  estimated \nweighted average cost of capital. If NHA or a commercial operator is to fully recover the capital \ncosts, revenues must be increased (e.g., non-toll user charges), since the potential to increase \ntolls is limited by the adverse impact of higher tolls on traffic volume.  \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n112.  Both the tranche 1 projects under the PFR are category A under ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) were carried out for \neach project and their summaries disclosed publicly on the ADB website in May 2006 (E-1) and \nApril 2007 (E-4). The EIAs reported that the potential adverse impacts of the construction and \nimplementation stages could be manageable with adequate mitigation and monitoring programs \nas  prescribed  in  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  No  component  of  any  project \nfalls in an environmentally sensitive or protected area.  \n \n113.  Environmental  assessments  for  all  the  ensuing  projects  under  future  tranches  will  be \nconducted in accordance with the Environmental Assessment Review Framework, prepared by \nthe Government and agreed with ADB in compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  regulations  and  guidelines  (Supplementary \nAppendix G). \n \n114.  The cumulative impacts of the proposed tranche 1 projects may be significant if they are \ntaken together with other interventions in the NTC to 2030. During that period, the trade volume \nis expected to grow exponentially. To address the potential cumulative impacts on land use, air \nquality,  water  resources,  and  public  health,  policy  dialogue  will  be  carried  out  and \nrecommendations  made  at  the  strategic  and  cross-sector  level  by  ADB.  A  cumulative  impact \nassessment  has  been  initiated  and  its  terms  of  reference  agreed  with  the  NHA.  The  target \ncompletion date will be September 2008 (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n115.  NHA  will  implement  the  EMPs.  NHA  will  ensure  that  bidding  documents  and  contracts \ninclude  the  mitigation  measures  required  in  the  EMPs,  that  the  mitigation  measures  are \nimplemented  by  the  contractors,  and  that  supervision  is  adequate.  An  adequate  budget  for \nimplementation has been provided in the EMPs and capacity building for the NHA safeguard unit \nin environmental management has been included in the Program (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nF. \n\nSocial Safeguards  \n\n116.  Substantial  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  expected  for  those  projects \nthat will require the construction of new roads. Full implementation of the land acquisition and \nresettlement  plan  will  be  a  condition  for  initiating  civil  works.  NHA,  with  the  affirmation  of  the \nMinistry  of  Communication,  has  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \nspecifying  compensation  provisions  and  preparation  and  implementation  procedures  for  the \nwhole  Program.  The  framework  also  covers  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  for  the \nprojects  under  tranche  1,  E-4  and  section  1  of  the  E-1.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework is in Supplementary Appendix J and the land acquisition and resettlement plans are \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  K.  Appraisal  of  subsequent  tranches  will  require  a  review  of  the \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nresettlement plan and preparation of land acquisition and resettlement plans for all projects with \nland acquisition and resettlement issues (Appendix 14). \n \n117. \nIndigenous  people  will  be  affected  only  by  projects  in  NWFP  tribal  areas.  NHA  has \nprepared  an  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  for  the  Program  (Supplementary \nAppendix L) and has included appropriate actions in the land acquisition and resettlement plan for \nsection 1 of E-1. Appraisal of subsequent tranches will require a review of the indigenous peoples \ndevelopment framework and the preparation of indigenous peoples development plans or actions \nfor  all  projects  with  issues  relating  to  indigenous  peoples.  Full  implementation  of  indigenous \npeoples  development  plans  will  be  a  condition  for  initiating  civil  works.  The  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment framework for the whole the Program is an appendix to the FFA. \n \nG. \n\nPoverty and Social Impact \n\n118.  Given the type of roads (expressways and motorways) to be financed by the Program, \nthe  direct  benefits  for  the  poor  will  not  be  substantial.  The  projects  will,  however,  create  an \nenabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction.  The  major  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts  will \ninclude (i) lower prices for transport services, food, and other daily necessities because of lower \ntransport costs and higher travel speeds; (ii) jobs and income generated from construction and \nmaintenance of the project; and (iii) better access to markets in large cities where goods may be \ncheaper (Appendix 15). \n \nH. \n\nPotential Risks and Assumptions \n\n119.  The  major  risk  under  the  investment  program  would  a  material  reversal  of  the  policy \nframework and instability in the country\u2019s business climate. This risk is likely  to be short-term in \nnature.  The  general  elections  process  will  bring  about  some  short  term  disruptions  but  most \nanalysts point to a continuation of the reform process, including the so-called second generation \nreforms. \n \n 120. \nImproving  the  transit  route  between  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  will  help  remove \nconstraints  to  stability  and  promote  subregional  cooperation.  By  developing  these  roads  the \nGovernment  is  demonstrating  its  wish  to  managing  the  political  stability  risk  in  the  area.  To \navoid the risk that the Program will not be sustainable because of inadequate maintenance, for \neach road improvement the Government will be required to enter into long-term operation and \nmaintenance contracts to be awarded to commercial contractors on the basis of competition. \n \n121.  The ability to attract private sector investment to the sector is another concern. The NTC \nhighway investment plan is simply too large for the public sector to execute entirely through its \nown resources. The Government needs to look outside for funds and partners and this will be \nsupported by the Program. (paras. 50\u201352) \n \n122.  The provincial and district roads that feeds into the NTC needs to be further improved to \nmaximize  the  benefits  of  the  network.  The  Government,  at  federal  and  local  level,  needs  to \nallocate adequate resources to these smaller but strategically important roads. The NTC Strategy \nwill identify the industries, advantageous location of these as well as logistic hubs along the NTC. \nThis study will assist the Government to identify and concentrate on the key feeder roads.  \n \nImplementation delays are a risk to the Program. For land acquisition and resettlement \n123. \nactivities,  delays  will  be  minimized  by  providing  consulting  services  to  support  NHA\u2019s \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  A  new  position  of  director  of  resettlement  will  be \ncreated  and  the  safeguard  focal  point  position  will  be  upgraded  from  director  to  general \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nmanager.  The  early  appointment  of  the  project  director  has  allowed  for  advanced  work  to \ncommence  in  land  acquisition.  The  risk  of  delays  because  of  slow  procurement  is  being \naddressed  by  (i)  early  ADB  approval  of  tranche  1  project  documents  for  recruiting  project \nsupervision  consultants  and  bidding  documents  for  civil  works,  (ii)  early  commencement  of \nadvance  recruitment  and  advance  procurement  actions,  (iii)  establishment  of  the  project \nmanagement offices, and (iv) appointment of the general manager and the project directors for \nthe tranche 1 projects. In addition, NHA has obtained internal approval of the project pro forma \ndocument, thereby ensuring early loan effectiveness. \n \n124.  An economic analysis of tranche 1 projects suggests there are no significant economic \nrisks. Sensitivity tests and risk analysis show that the projects will be economically viable even \nunder  a  combination  of  adverse  scenarios.  The  risk  of  adverse  social  and  environmental \nimpacts has been addressed through the mitigation measures in the resettlement plan, the EIA, \nand  the  EMP  and  through  associated  conditions  and  assurances  in  the  project  loans.  The \nProgram  projects  will  be  required  to  comply  with  all  eligibility  criteria  before  receiving  ADB \nfinancing. \n \n125.  The use of a new financing modality over the 10-year implementation period poses a risk \nfor both Pakistan and for ADB. Dedicated ADB program teams will be available to offer advice \nand  guide  NHA  on  specific  issues  and  problems  pertaining  to  operations  under  the  MFF.  The \nGovernment and NHA are providing ADB with a set of warranties and representations and may \nneed  real-time  support  before  formally  submitting  PFRs  under  the  MFF.  A  core  team  of \nconsultants will be on board to help NHA throughout the PFR process. This is clearly one of the \nadvantages  of  the  MFF.  NHA  has  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  adhere  to  the  MFF \nunderstandings, but from time to time the team in Pakistan will require special assistance.  \n \n126. \nIn the areas of procurement, accounting, and reporting, capacity will be built in financial \nmanagement,  budgeting,  management  and  information  systems,  and  financial  planning.  The \nlonger-term objective, however, will be to leave in place systems, people, and procedures that \ncan outlive the Program. The Government and NHA are especially keen on this approach and \nwill work with ADB toward this goal. \n \n127.  The fiduciary risk under the Program will be addressed mainly through the arrangements \nmade (paras. 109\u2013111). The financial sustainability of NHA needs to be addressed so that the \nhighway network can be maintained and expanded (paras. 41 and 43). \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and NHA have given the following \n128. \nassurances,  which  have  largely  been  incorporated  in  the  FFA,  and  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nindividual loan agreement (s) and project agreement (s) as applicable and mutually agreed among \nthe Government, NHA, and ADB for each project under the MFF.   \n \n\n1. \n\nResolution of Cash Development Loans \n\n129.  To  ensure  the  long-term  financial  sustainability  of  NHA,  the  Government  will  take \nnecessary actions to resolve NHA\u2019s accumulated cash development loans by 30 September 2008 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nby converting the debt to equity and/or grant, or entering into alternative financial arrangements \nsuch as leasing NHA assets transferred by NHA to the Government (RSDF40 M1-4).  \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Highway Authority Business Plan \n\n130.  NHA  will  prepare  and  submit  to  the  Government  a  5-year  business  plan,  including  a \nfinancing  plan,  an  investment  plan,  and  a  budget.  The  Government  will  endorse  the  business \nplan by 31 January 2008 (RSDF M1-2). \n \n\n3. \n\nHighway Toll Revenue Policy \n\n131.  To balance the economic benefit to society and the financial benefit to NHA, NHA will, in \nconsultation  with  ADB,  prepare  a  highway  toll  revenue  policy  for  consideration  by  the \nGovernment  in  line  with  the  National  Transport  Policy;  the  policy  will  be  approved  by  \n31 December 2012 (RSDF M1-6). \n \n\n4. \n\nContracting of Operation and Maintenance  \n\n132.  Prior  to  completion  of  each  highway  project  in  this  Program,  NHA  will  enter  into  a \ncontract or concession for the operation and maintenance of each highway with a commercial \nentity awarded a contract following a competitive bidding process. \n \n\n5. \n\nSafeguard Strengthening \n\n133. \nIn  consultation  with  ADB,  NHA  will prepare  an action  plan for  safeguards  by  31  March \n2008.  NHA  will  also  adopt  (i)  preliminary  guidelines  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  by  \n30 June 2008 and (ii) guidelines for land acquisition and resettlement to be applied at all NHA \noffices nationwide by 30 November 2008. By 31 December 2007, NHA will upgrade the existing \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  unit  to  be  headed  by  a  senior  officer  at  the  general \nmanager or equivalent level, with a director for environment and a director for resettlement and \nadequately staffed with qualified personnel (RSDF M5-1, M5-2). \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Management  \n\n NHA  will  ensure  that  its  internal  controls  are  adequate  for  preparation  of  financial \n134. \nstatements  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and  for  annual \nindependent audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing. NHA will ensure that \nall  qualifications  to  the  audited  financial  statements  will  be  rectified  by  30  September  2008 \n(RSDF M2-3). \n \n\n7. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n135.  NHA  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  land  and  rights  of  way  required  by  projects  are  made \navailable  in  a  timely  manner;  (ii)  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plans  are  implemented \npromptly  and  efficiently  according  to  their  terms,  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  Pakistan, \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework agreed with ADB; (iii) the resettlement plans are updated based on detailed designs, \nare  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  affected  persons,  and  are  disclosed  to  them  prior  to \nsubmitting the resettlement plans to ADB; (iv) the finalized and updated resettlement plans are \nreviewed  and  approved  by  ADB  prior  to  contract  award  and  compensation  paid  prior  to  the \n\n                                                 \n40 Refer to the Road Sector Development Framework in Appendix 5.  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\ncommencement of civil works; (v) contractors\u2019 activities are in compliance with requirements of \nthe  resettlement  plans,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework,  applicable  domestic \nlaws, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy; and (vi) an independent monitor acceptable to \nADB is engaged to carry out monitoring and evaluation and to report to ADB in accordance with \nthe requirements of the resettlement plans. \n \n\n8. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n136.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Cabinet  Commission  on  Investment  confirms  the \nrevised  \u201cPolicy  Framework  and  Package  of  Incentives  for  Private  Sector  Participation  in \nHighway and Bridge Projects\u201d by 30 December 2008 (RSDF M6-3). \n \n\n9. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n137.  NHA will ensure that all projects affecting ethnic minorities are constructed and operated \nin accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) as specified \nin  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019  development  framework  agreed  with  ADB  and  the  detailed \nindigenous  peoples  development  plans  (or  resettlement  plans).  NHA  will  ensure  that  the \nindigenous peoples development plans (or resettlement plans) are monitored and evaluated by \nan independent agency. \n \n\n10. \n\nEnvironment \n\n138.  NHA  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  projects  are  constructed  and  operated  in  accordance  with \nnational and local environmental procedures and guidelines and with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003);  (ii)  the  projects  are  selected, \ndesigned,  constructed,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  the  EIAs  or  IEEs  and  the \nenvironmental assessment review framework; (iii) the EMPs as reflected in the EIAs and IEEs \nwill be incorporated in bidding documents and civil work contracts and will be implemented; and \n(iv)  environmental  performance  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  annually  during  the \nconstruction  period,  including  progress  made  on  mitigation  measures,  monitoring,  problems \nencountered, enforcement plans, and any violations. \n \n\n11. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n139.  Gender.  NHA  will  follow  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development \n(1998)  during  the  implementation  of  each  project,  including  taking  all  necessary  actions  to \nensure  that  (i)  equal  opportunities  are  provided  to  women  for  road  construction  activities;  \n(ii)  there  is  no  differential  payment  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value;  and  \n(iii)  women  living  in  the  project  area  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  planning  and \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  NHA  will  monitor  project  effects  on  women  during \nimplementation  of  each  project  through,  where  relevant,  gender-disaggregated  data  collected \npursuant  to  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  referred  to  in  the  Project  Performance \nMonitoring System. \n \n140.  Sexually transmitted infections. The Government will ensure that all projects financed \nunder  the  Program  include  appropriate  measures  to  mitigate  the  potential  risk  of  sexually \ntransmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV/AIDS. These measures will include carrying out public \nawareness  programs  on  the  risks  and  prevention  of  the  transmission  of  HIV/AIDS.  NHA  will \nensure  that  appropriate  information  is  posted  in  selected  areas  along  the  project  roads  \n(e.g., border areas, gas stations, restaurants, and weighing stations) and transport workers and \ntheir families, motorway personnel, relevant police offices, and people in the project areas are \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\ntrained.  Civil  works  bidding  documents  and  contracts  for  each  project  will  include  provisions \nrequiring  contractors  to  (i)  disseminate  information  at  work  sites  on  the  risks  of  STDs  and \nHIV/AIDS as part of the health and safety measures for those employed during construction and \n(ii) take measures to protect workers from potential exposure to STDs and to provide them with \ntesting and treatment if needed. Similarly, the civil works contracts will also include clauses to \nregulate the behavior of workers in relation to the local communities in project areas. \n \n141.  Working  conditions  and  child  labor.  NHA will ensure through the civil works bidding \ndocuments  and  contracts  that  (i)  contractors  follow  legally  mandated  provisions  on  health, \nsanitation, and appropriate working conditions including accommodation where appropriate for \nconstruction  workers  at  construction  campsites;  (ii)  contractors  do  not  employ  child  labor  in \nconstruction and maintenance activities; and (iii) appropriate facilities are provided for children \nof laborers in construction campsites, all in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of \nthe Government. \n \n142.  Human  trafficking.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  public  awareness  campaigns  on \nhuman  trafficking,  particularly  of  women  and  children,  are  carried  out  to  reduce  the  risk  of \ntrafficking around construction camps and bus and other transport facilities.  \n \n\n12. \n\nExecution of Civil Works Contracts \n\n143.  NHA will ensure that, subsequent to awarding civil works contract under any project, no \nsection or part thereof will be handed over to the contractor until the applicable provisions of the \nland acquisition and resettlement framework and resettlement plans (including in particular the \ntimely  delivery  of  compensation  to  affected  families),  indigenous  peoples\u2019  development \nframework  and  indigenous  peoples\u2019  development  plans,  and  the  Environmental  Assessment \nReview Framework and EMPs have been complied with. \n \n144.  Any  changes  to  the  location,  land  alignment  of  roads,  or  environmental  impacts  on \naccount of detailed designs of related projects will be subject to prior approval by ADB and the \nrelevant  government  agency  in  accordance  with  the  project  selection  criteria  and  approval \nprocedures in the FFA. \n \n\n13. \n\nProject Selection Criteria \n\n145.  The  Government  and  NHA  will  ensure  that  all  projects  are  selected  and  approved  in \naccordance  with  the  agreed  criteria  and  procedures  set  out  in  the  FFA.  NHA  will  monitor  the \nimplementation of projects through completion. \n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n146.  The  effectiveness  of  the  ADF  and  OCR  loan  agreements  will  be  subject  to  a  cross-\neffectivity provision. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n147. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  loans  under  the  multitranche  financing \nfacility in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $900,000,000 equivalent to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program comprising  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe  loans  not  exceeding  $890,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)- based lending facility; and \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  6,451,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years;  \n\n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President  \n\n \n \n \n22 October 2007 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n32\n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\n \nAssumption \nGovernment continues with \npolicies conducive to economic \ngrowth \n \nRisk \nPolitical instability \nGeopolitical instability \n  \n\n \nAssumptions  \n\u2022  All other NTC highway \n\ninvestments are implemented \nas scheduled \n\n\u2022  Capacity building support for \nNHA provided by previous \ninterventions successfully \nimplemented \n\n\u2022  Improved road safety \nregulations in place  \n\n\u2022  Rational road user charge \n\npolicy in place \n\n\u2022  Rolling 5-year maintenance \n\nplan updated and carried out \n\n \nRisk \nInadequate financial resources \nfor road maintenance  \n\nDesign  \nSummary \n \nImpact \nIncreased trade \ngrowth  \n\nOutcome \nEfficiency gain for \nroad traffic \noperation along the \nNational Trade \nCorridor \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nPerformance  \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\u2022  National socioeconomic \n\nstatistics from the Central \nStatistics Office \n\n \n\u2022  ADB\u2019s PCR and PPER \n\u2022  NHA \u2018s periodic traffic \ncounts and surveys \n\n\u2022  Freight Forwarder \n\nAssociation statistics \n\u2022  NHA financial statement \n\u2022  Central Statistics Office \n \n\n \nBy 2022: \n\u2022  Increased gross domestic \nproduct from $114 billion \n(2006 estimate) to $336 \nbillion  \n\n \n\u2022  Increased trade from   \n\n$35 billion (2006) to $170 \nbillion \n\n \n\nBy 2017: \n\u2022  Traffic volume. \n\nPeshawar\u2013Torkham \n5,000 vehicles per day \n(diverted traffic) and \n8,000 per day \n  (induced traffic) \n\u2022  Reduced average \ntravel time.

Road  transport  services  are  mainly \noperated  by  private  sector  enterprises  with  the  small  share  of  government-owned  goods \nhandled  by  a  public  sector  agency.  At  the  local  and  intra-regional  level,  the  road  transport \nindustry is characterized by poor service quality and unreliability.  \n \n2. \nOverall demand for road transport has increased rapidly in recent years. Gains in traffic \non  the  road  network  have  been  at  the  expense  of  the  railway  network,  which  will  require \nsubstantial and expensive upgrading over an extensive period. In the meantime, the demand for \nroad transport will continue to increase.  \n \nTrucks comprise almost half of non-urban road traffic; cars, 30%; and light vehicles and \n3. \nbuses, 20%. The truck fleet is dominated by obsolete and underpowered vehicles and has not \nchanged  radically  in  the  last  20  years.  Changes  in  truck  configuration  have  been  largely \nconcentrated in the long-haul fleet, where the number of rigid three-axle trucks and tractor-trailer \nunits has increased much more quickly than the number of rigid two-axle units. Stringent vehicle \ntesting and better enforcement of legislation governing vehicle conditions will be more effective \nat improving vehicle fleet efficiency and safety than road infrastructure upgrading.   \n \nThe  trucking  industry  is  very  competitive  with  minimal  barriers  to  entry  and  a  large \n4. \nnumber  of  operators.  Haulage  rates  are  low  and  have  fallen  over  the  last  20  years,  despite \nincreases in fuel prices.1 The long-distance trucking industry (where customers require a more \nreliable  and  secure  service)  is,  however,  less  competitive.  Acquisition  of  newer,  modern \nvehicles is expensive and beyond the means of all but a few vehicle owners. As a result, there \nare few long-distance operators, and they can and do impose significantly higher haulage rates \nfor long-distance traffic.  \n \nB.  \n\nProvision of Roads \n\n5. \nThe total road network is about 260,000 kilometers (km), of which about 11,400 km are \nnational  highways,  92,500  are  provincial  highways,  and  150,000  are  district  or  urban  roads. \nResponsibility  for  managing  the  total  road  network  is  vested  in  the  federal  National  Highway \nAuthority  (NHA)2 and  in  provincial  and  district  administrations.  NHA  is  responsible  for  national \nhighways, \nlimited-access  motorways,  partly-limited-access  expressways,  and \nunlimited-access  highways.  About  7,000  km  of  the  national  highway  network  are  two-lane, \nundivided roads. Travel on roads is severely constrained by non-motorized traffic and by slow-\nmoving motorized traffic. As a result, transportation is inefficient and travel times, delivery times \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n1  Transport  Competitiveness  in  Pakistan.  Report  No.  36523.  2006.  World  Bank  South  Asia  Region  quotes  annual \n\ndeclines in freight rates of 1.4% per year and an increase in fuel prices of 3.2 % per year. \n\n2  The National Highway Authority (NHA) is an autonomous agency with a functional structure and regional offices for \nwork  implementation.  NHA  has  limited  capacity,  particularly  in  strategic  planning,  asset  management,  project \nmanagement  and  network  operation.  Concurrently,  it  is  introducing  modern  road  asset  management  and \nmaintenance  systems  for  operation  and  maintenance  and  integrating  them  into  day-to-day  operations.  Under  the \nNHA  Act,  1991,  NHA  is  permitted  to  receive  funds  from  various  sources,  including  loans  and  grants  from  the \nfederal government, foreign aid and grants and other receipts (lease monies, fees, rentals, fines etc) and is able to \nfloat bonds and charge road user fees.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n36\n\nfor  goods,  and  transport  costs  are  higher  than  they  should  be.  Road  safety  is  also \ncompromised. \n \nC.  \n\nIssues and Challenges \n\n6. \nAccessibility. Roads are not equally distributed throughout the country. In terms of road \nlength per capita, Sindh Province is the best served in terms of road density (0.57 km/km2) and, \nexcept for Baluchistan, is also best in terms of population per kilometer of road (2,420 km per \nmillion). Baluchistan Province is significantly better served in terms of km per capita (5,909 km \nper million).  \n \n7. \nRoad conditions. A survey of road conditions was carried out on motorways and other \nnational  highways  from  December  2005  to  March  2006.3 The  results  in  terms  of  roughness  of \npavement are presented in Table A2.1.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Condition of Motorways and National Highways in Pakistan (2006) \n\n \n\n \n\n \nMotorways \n\nNational \nHighwaysa \n\n \n\n \n\nIRI \nkm \n% \n\nkm \n\n% \n\nPavement Condition \n\nGood  \n\nFair  \n\nPoor  \n\nBad  \n\nUnder \nconstruction \n\nTotal \n\n< 4 \n439 \n72% \n\n4 - 6\n21\n3% \n\n4,959 \n\n2,032 \n\n38% \n\n18% \n\n6 - 8\n4\n1% \n\n1,756 \n\n17% \n\n>8\n0\n0% \n\n751 \n\n7% \n\n \n145 \n24% \n\n1,285 \n\n13% \n\n \n\n \n\n608\n \n\n10,783 \n\nIRI= International Roughness Index; km = kilometers. \na About 646 km of national highway in urban areas was not surveyed but is included in the total. \nSource: National Highway Authority.  \n\n \n8. \nIt  can  be  seen  that  75%  of  the  motorway  network  and  56%  of  the  national  highway \nnetwork are in good or fair condition. This suggests there have been significant improvements in \nroad  conditions  since  2000,  when  about  63%  of  the  national  highway  network  was  in  poor  or \nbad condition. \n \n9. \nAbout  75%  of  the  network  is  two-lane  undivided  roads  that  are  6\u20137  meters  wide.  On \nthese  roads  theoretical  capacity  and  running  speeds  are  largely  unattainable  because  of  the \namount  of  non-motorized  traffic  and  slow-moving  truck  traffic.  Operating  conditions  and  road \nsafety are further undermined by the encroachment of commercial and other developments on \nthe  roadside.  Only  25%of  the  network  is  either  four-  or  six-lane  roads.  Overall,  average  travel \nspeeds  are  estimated  to  be  little  more  than  25  km  per  hour  (kph)  compared  with  75  kph  in \ndeveloped  countries.  Accident  rates  are  estimated  to  be  10  times  higher  than  in  developed \ncountries.  \n \nThe  condition  of  the  provincial  roads  is  significantly  worse  than  that  of  the  national \n10. \nhighway  network.  Many  roads  are  either  permanently  impassable  or  subject  to  closure  during \nbad weather. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Annual Maintenance Plan for Fiscal Year 2006-07. \n\n \n \n\n\f37 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad funding. The NHA development and maintenance budgets have traditionally been \n11. \nunderfunded.  Development  funds  are  in  the  form  of  government  cash  loans  and  are  currently \nabout  PRs25  billion  annually,  which  is  below  the  PRs40  billion  per  year  needed  to  meet  the \ngovernment  plan  for  motorway  construction.    Annual  maintenance,  repair,  and  operational \nexpenditures  for  existing  motorways  and  national  roads  are  funded  from  several  sources: \ngovernment  grants  (approximately  PRs1.4  billion),  road \ntolls  net  of  collection  costs \n(approximately PRs4.5 billion), and miscellaneous income from right-of-way leases, police fines \nfor traffic infringements and overloading, and advertising. Road maintenance expenditures have \nbeen  increasing  and  represent  a  rising  proportion  of  total  expenditures;  however  they  remain \nwell below needs, which are in excess of PRs10 billion per year.   \n \n12. \nIn  all,  NHA  receives  an  annual  income  of  PRs6\u20137  billion.  This  compares  with  an \nestimate  of  PRs8  billion  for  current  expenditures,  plus  another  PRs1\u20132  billion  to  meet  the \nmounting  backlog  of  road  and  bridge  repairs.  Raising  maintenance  funds  to  the  level  of  need \nwill  require  either  more  revenues  from  road  users  or  larger  government  grants  (increases  in \nlease revenues or police fines are unlikely to be significant). If road tolls were to be increased, \nthere  would  be  a  negative  impact  on  traffic  volume  and  in  any  case  the  Government  would \nprobably not agree to a toll increase.  \n \n13. \nRoad maintenance. NHA has established a road asset management directorate to plan \nand oversee maintenance operations. Local supervision and monitoring are carried out by NHA \nregional offices. Surveys of road conditions are carried out annually and from these annual work \nprograms  are  prepared  using  the  HDM-4  model.4 There  is  also  an  annual  consultation  with \nstakeholders  for  their  input  on  the  need  for  maintenance.    For  fiscal  year  2007,  the  funding \nthe  national  highway  network  and  motorways  was  estimated  at  \nrequirement \nPRs14  billion  for  periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  plus  about  PRs3  billion  for  routine \nmaintenance.  The  available  total  budget  for  the  year  was  under  PRs7  billion,  and  a \nmaintenance program was prepared according to the amount allocated to NHA. Increases in toll \nfees to eliminate the government grant have been resisted but are the long-term aim. Proposals \nto establish a road fund are also under consideration  \n \n14. \nRoad  accidents. Since 2000, reported road accidents have averaged over 10,000 per \nyear and have resulted in about 5,150 fatalities. At about 10 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, this \nrate is very high when compared with developed countries but low for developing countries. An \nearlier Asian Development Bank (ADB) report estimates, however, that the actual fatality rate is \nover 30 per 10,000 vehicles.5 There are no official audits to support either contention.  \n \n15. \nThe main causes of road accidents are driving at speeds inappropriate to vehicle and road \nconditions, lack of safety awareness, poor discipline, and poor enforcement of regulations. Under \nthe  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  Road  Development  Sector  and  Subregional \nConnectivity Project,6 a pilot project on road safety will be carried out for sections of the national \nhighway  in  NWFP.  It  is  intended  that  the  findings  and  recommended  actions  will  be  applied \nthroughout Pakistan. \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n4  The  Highway  Development  and  Management  System  (HDM-4)  is  a  software  system  for  formulating  options  for \n\ninvesting in road transport infrastructure. \n\n5  ADB.  2005.

Vehicle  overloading  is  a  major  cause  of  premature  pavement \n\n \n16.  Major  initiatives  to  date  to  reduce  accidents  have  been  confined  to  motorways  and \nnational  highways.  These  include  providing  safety  barriers  and  creating  the  National  Highway \nand  Motorway  Police  (NHMP).  In  practice,  the  NHMP  concentrate  its  activities  on  the \nmotorways where the present force of 836 staff represents more than 2 persons per km.   \n \n17. \ndeterioration and of road accidents.  \n \n18. \nThere are 54 vehicle weighing stations throughout Pakistan. As in many other countries, \nthey are ineffective in restricting axle loading and keeping truck loads to within legal limits. The \nlevels  of  fines  are  low  (about  Rs100  per  excess  ton  of  load)  and  represent  an  insignificant \namount  in  relation  to  haulage  revenues  and  load  value.  Where  overloading  is  extreme,  many \ndrivers  are  unable  to  pay  and  the  fine  is  overlooked.  Neither  unloading  facilities  nor  storage \nspaces are available at the weighing stations; therefore, offloading so that loads can be reduced \nto within the legal limits is not possible. \n \n19. \nEven  new  trucks  lack  the  full  efficiency  and  performance  characteristics  available  in \nother countries. About 30% of the components in locally assembled vehicles are local and have \nlower specifications than those available elsewhere. Imported vehicle designs are generally old \ntechnology,  including,  for  example,  the  use  of  naturally  aspirated  rather  than  turbo-charged \nengines.  Importing  second-hand  trucks  is  limited  to  dump  trucks,  but  many  are  converted  for \ngeneral freight haulage. \n \nOverloading  further  compounds  the  problem  of  low  basic  performance  of  trucks.  As  a \n20. \nresult, truck traffic is slow and reduces the speed at which traffic in general can flow, even on \nmotorways and other roads in good condition. \n \nPrivate sector participation. Private sector participation will be an essential component \n21. \nof proposed trade and transit initiatives, including highway development. The NHA development \nplan identifies projects valued at PRs8.730 billion for public\u2013private sector financing. However, \ndifficulties have been encountered in attracting private sector interest and an appropriate legal \nframework  has  yet  to  be  put  in  place.  Under  the  current  condition  only  a  small  number  of \nprojects in the pipeline would be able to attract adequate private sector interest.  .   \n \nD. \n\nRoad Sector Policy  \n\nThe  Medium  Term  Development  Framework  (MTDF)  2005\u20132010  outlined  government \n\n22. \npolicy for the transport sector.

The total length is \nabout 10% of the NTC highway investment plan.  These sections are economically viable and \nare key connections in the NTC highway network.  Because of the high cost per kilometer (km) \nand the unproven traffic volume, there is unlikely to be private sector investment in the roads. \nThe sections cost from $4.2 million to $2.2 million per km. compared with the average of $1.5 \nmillion  per  km  for  majority  of  the  roads  in  the  NTC  highway  investment  plan.

The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  will  ensure  that \ndetailed  design  reports  of  the  respective  packages  are  prepared  within  the \noverall  time  frame  agreed  for  the  Program  and  not  more  than  5  months  after \nproject approval. A road safety audit will be conducted during project design. \n\nThe  projects  will  be  economically  feasible  and  financially  sustainable,  and  their \nestimated economic internal rate of return will be equal to or higher than 12%, or \nthe roads will be a key section integral to the connectivity of NTC, based on an \neconomic analysis to be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects (1997). \n\nEnvironmental  screening  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003)  will  be  conducted  for  all  civil  works  packages.  The  selected \nroad  sections  will  not  pass  through  or  be  within  or  less  than  1  (km)  from \nprotected  areas  as  designated  by  the  Government,  including  sanctuaries  or \nnational  parks.  For  each  project,  an  environmental  assessment  report  will  be \nprepared,  including  an  environmental  management  plan  in  accordance  with  the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework. \n\nIn  line  with  the  larger  objectives  of  the  Program,  the  highway  sections  will  be \nsocially sound and include measures to mitigate any possible social impacts. For \neach  package,  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on initial poverty and social assessment. \n\nResettlement  plans  for  each  package  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement. \n\nIf  any  indigenous  peoples  or  tribal peoples  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly \nby any civil works package, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan or special \naction will be prepared following the measures set forth in the indigenous people \ndevelopment framework. \n\n(viii)  All necessary federal and provincial government approval will be obtained; and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n47\n\n \n\n(ix) \n\nSufficient  Government  counterpart  funding  will  be  allocated  to  implement  the \nprojects. \n\nProcedures \n\n \nB.  \n\n2.  \n\nEach project will be prepared and processed in accordance the following procedures: \n \n(i) \n\nA feasibility study for projects will be conducted by consultants engaged by NHA, \nwho  will  fill  out  checklists  for  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment,  involuntary \nresettlement, \nindigenous  people,  and  environmental  screening.  These \ndocuments will be sent for review to ADB and may require revisions. \n\nUpon completion of the detailed design, NHA will prepare and submit to ADB a \nsummary  appraisal  report \nthe  required \nfor  each  project, \nattachments,  including  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  environmental \nassessment,  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategies,  and  indigenous \npeople development plan or special action plan for indigenous people if required. \n\ntogether  with \n\n \n(iii)   NHA will translate each project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement plan into the \nlocal  language  (Urdu  and/or  possibly  Pashtu)  and  disclose  it  to  affected  people \nbefore  submitting  it  to  ADB.  NHA  will  revise  the  resettlement  plan  if  required, \nbased on comments from affected people and from ADB. \n\n \n(iv)   NHA  (and  ADB)  will  disclose  each  project  summary  environmental  assessment \nreport for category A or B projects to the public 120 days before ADB's approval \nof the relevant periodic financing request. \n\n \n(ii)  \n\n \n(v)  \n\nADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  reports,  together  with  the  required \nattachments.  If  it  finds  that  the  project  does  not  satisfy  eligibility  criteria  and \nprocedures,  or  does  not  comply  with  ADB's  policies,  ADB  may  advise  NHA  to \nmodify  the  project.  In  addition,  NHA  will  prepare  draft  pro  forma  (PC1)  reports \nand forward them at the same time as the appraisal reports to ADB. \n\n \n3.  \nBased  on  ADB's  approval,  and  subject  to  any  modification  and  remedial  measures \nrequired by ADB, NHA will implement the projects. NHA will ensure that ADB has access to all \ndocuments related to the project proposals and approval process. These documents should be \nkept for 5 years after approval. \n \nC.  \n\nOrganizational Arrangements \n\nNHA  will  appraise  the  projects,  and  ADB  will  advise  NHA  to  comply  with  the  eligibility \n\n4.  \ncriteria and procedures and to follow other relevant policies. \n \n5.  \nThe  project  management  office,  assisted  by  the  technical  audit  team  (formed  from \nexperts  within  the  project  management  office  and  NHA)  will  process  the  projects  for  quality \ncontrol  of  preparation  and  contract  implementation.  This  team  will  review  and  examine  all \ntechnical  reports,  including  feasibility  studies,  preliminary  design  reports,  environmental \nassessment  reports,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans,  and  detailed  design  reports,  to \nensure that Government and ADB requirements are fully met.  \n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nThe  technical  audit  team  will  evaluate  the  viability  of  each  project  and  prepare  a \n6.  \nsummary appraisal report to be submitted to ADB for approval. This report will require clearance \nfrom the NHA chairperson, before it is submitted to ADB along with all necessary attachments. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n49\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n\nTotal Cost\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nItem\n\nTotal\n\n%\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\nGovernment\n\n \n\n9,545\n64,931\n\n89,482\n389,247\n\n3,579\n15,570\n\n0\n\n23,936\n51,385\n75,322\n647,675\n\n56,815\n4,864\n0\n61,679\n\n709,354\n\n2,500\n875\n3,125\n1,250\n2,500\n2,250\n12,500\n\nADB\n\nAmount\n\n72,682\n316,168\n\n3,579\n15,570\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n23,936\n51,385\n75,322\n483,321\n\n56,815\n4,864\n0\n61,679\n\n545,000\n76.8\n\n2,000\n700\n2,500\n1,000\n2,000\n1,800\n10,000\n\nI.

Two  thirds  of  the  volume  of  interregional  trade  originates \nfrom  Punjab  province,  particularly  the  areas  of  Lahore,  Sargodhar,  and  Sheikharpura, \nfollowed by Islamabad\u2013Rawalpindi and Multan. The highest trade volumes are within Punjab \nprovince and the northern and central areas of Sindh. The highest intra-provincial cargo flow \nis from west Punjab to north-east Punjab (22,700 tons). Other flows exceeding 15,000 tons \nannually  are  northern  Punjab  to  northeastern  Punjab  and  vice  versa,  northern  and  central \nSindh  to  Karachi,  Karachi  to  southern  Baluchistan,  Karachi  to  northeastern  Punjab,  and \nsouthern Baluchistan to Karachi. All these flows except for those to and from Baluchistan are \nserved by highways forming part of the National Trade Corridor (NTC). Most use less than \n30% of the total corridor length. \n \nB. \n\nOverall Travel Performance \n\n2. \nThe  north\u2013south  roads  have  accommodated  much  of  the  increase  in  freight \nmovement.  Traffic  volumes  throughout  the  main  highway  network  were  estimated  using \nCube Software. Forecasts for transport demand were derived from the comprehensive data \nset  created  during  the  Pakistan  Transport  Plan  Study1.  This  model  uses  vehicle  operating \ncosts and travel time as the determinants for the assignment of origin, i.e., destination road \ntransport  demand.  The  current  traffic  on  the  existing  roads  ranges  from  about  2,000 \npassenger car units (pcu)/day in Torkham\u2013Landi Kotal (N5) to 15,000 pcu/day in Umarkot\u2013\nRohri (N5) and 22,000 pcu/day in Karachi\u2013Hyderabad (M9).  \n \n3. \nUnder  a  \u201cdo-minimum\u201d  scenario  where  ongoing  road  works  and  other  nominal \nrehabilitation  works  were  taken  into  account,  the  vehicle  and  capacity  ratios  of  N5  road \nsections  in  2015  were  estimated  at  about  0.7  or  above,  which  is  theoretically  reaching \ncapacity.  \n \nC.  \n\nEconomic Feasibility of National Trade Corridor Highways \n\n4. \nThe  \u201cdo-minimum\u201d  was  compared  with  a  \u201cwith  development\u201d  case  in  which  all  the \nNational  Transport  Corridor  highway  investment  plan  proposed  works  were  included.  The \ntotal  financial  cost  of  the  road  development  program  of  about  3,700  km  of  roads  and  four \nnew  bridges  was  estimated  at  PRs264  billion  (exclusive  of  land  acquisition  and  price \ncontingency). It is assumed that this expenditure will be incurred over the period 2008\u20132014. \nSubsequent  increases  in  maintaining  the  road  network  will  rise  to  an  average  of  \nPRs3.7 billion per year.  \n \n5. \nCommercial  vehicle  travel  times  between  Peshawar  and  Karachi  are  currently  over \n72  hours  but  would  be  reduced  to  about  36  hours  following  the  completion  of  National \nTransport Corridor highway investment plan. As traffic grows on the new roads, the impact \non  reduced  speeds  caused  by  the  increase  in  the  number  of  cars  will  be  significantly  less \nthan without the capacity added by the new roads. As a result the savings in travel time will \ngrow  more  rapidly  than  the  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs.  This  is  without  allowing  for \nincreases in the unit value of time which, with increased real incomes, should also rise. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  2006.  Pakistan  Transport  Plan  Study  in  the  Islamic  Republic  of \n\nPakistan. Tokyo. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n6. \nThere will be a gradual build-up of benefits from reduced vehicle operating costs as \nthe  improved  network  is  expanded.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the \noverall National Transport Corridor highway investment plan is 39%, inclusive of the values \nof  time.  Without  a  value  assigned  to  time,  the  EIRR  was  estimated  at  34%.  The  share  of \nbenefits shifts from predominantly savings in vehicle operating costs to benefits from savings \nin time (Table A13.1). Total savings were estimated at an average of PRs200 billion per year \nor about 3% of the Pakistan\u2019s 2005 gross domestic product (GDP).  \n \n\nTable A13.1: National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan Benefits \n(PRs million) \n \n\nYear \n\nWithout  Program \n\nWith  Program \n\nBenefits  \n\n  \n\nVehicle \noperating \ncosts \n1,650,876 \n2,275,311 \n3,287,493 \n\nPassenger \ntravel time \nvalue \n149,363 \n282,305 \n615,052 \n\n2015 \n2020 \n2025 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n\nVehicle \noperating \ncosts \n1,490,058 \n2,098,575 \n3,062,030 \n\n \n\nPassenger \ntravel time \nvalue \n123,909 \n211,105 \n433,816 \n\nVehicle \noperating \ncost savings \n160,818 \n176,736 \n225,463 \n\nTravel time \nsavings \n\n25,454 \n71,200 \n181,236 \n\n7. \nThe less rapid increase in savings in vehicle operating costs compared with savings \nin  time  reflects  the  onset  of  renewed  congestion  even  with  the  proposed  road  capacity \nincreases. As truck traffic is less sensitive to travel time, it will increasingly revert back to the \npresently  used  roads  and  away  from  the  new  roads  as  traffic  volumes  on  the  new  roads \nincrease. This indicates that further increases in capacity will be required within the next 20 \nyears. This was a conclusion of the Pakistan Transport Plan Study, which suggested that the \nmotorway  system  should  include  two  parallel  north\u2013south  motorways,  one  on  each  side  of \nthe Indus River.  \n \n\nII.  \n\nSensitivity Test: Economic Evaluation of Tranche 1 Projects \n\nA. \n\nMethodology \n\n8. \nA  sensitivity  test  was  performed  to  assess  the  worst-case  scenario  (only  individual \nprojects  under  tranche  1  are  constructed).  Standard  methods  were  used  to  evaluate  the \ntime-related  economic costs  and benefits  directly  associated  with the proposed  roads.  The \ncosts are the resources needed to construct and maintain the road. Benefits are savings by \nroad  users,  including  travel  time.  Because  the  road  does  not  replace  an  existing  road  that \nwould have continued to be maintained, no significant savings in road maintenance will be \nrealized. \n \n9. \nThe existing roads will be maintained in good condition but travel speeds on them will \nremain  low  even  after  the  project  road  is  completed  because  of  non-motorized  and  slow-\nmoving  motorized  traffic.  Therefore  a  speed-related  rather  than  a  pavement-roughness-\nrelated, vehicle operating cost model was used to calculate road user costs with and without \nthe project. Estimated speeds are assumed to decline slightly over time in both models on \nthe existing roads as traffic grows. There will also be some decline in speeds on the project \nroad as traffic increases, but these reductions will be more modest. Benefits associated with \nthe reduced incidence and severity of road traffic accidents was not included.  \n \n10. \nCivil  works  and  vehicle  operating  costs  have  been  estimated  at  2006  prices.  Road \nmaintenance  costs  were  estimated  at  PRs150,000  per  year  for  routine  maintenance  and \nPRs 2,000,000 per intervention for periodic maintenance. It was assumed that there would \nbe  periodic  maintenance  interventions  in  the  8th  and  15th  years  following  opening.  A \nresidual value for the project of 10% of capital cost has been included in the final year of the \nevaluation period of 20 years. \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59\n\n \n11. \nTraffic  growth  rates  on  the  project  roads  are  forecast  to  be  slightly  higher  than  the \nnational average.  This is based on expectations of increased trade between Pakistan and \nAfghanistan  and  the  restoration  of  and  subsequent  sustained  growth  in  personal  travel \nbetween the two countries. The analysis assumes the annual growth rates in total traffic on \nthe  route  range  will  be  7.0\u20139.0%  between  2005  and  2010,  and  5.5\u20137.0%  after  2020  for \nvarious types of vehicles. \n \n12. \nThe proposed projects are new roads on new alignments and will compete for traffic \non  the  existing  road.  Therefore  there  are  no  normal  traffic  benefits  to  evaluate.  Generated \ntraffic is generally restricted to increased demand for travel (vehicle-kilometer) as a result of \nreduced  costs  and  travel  time.  The  improved  NTC  highway  network  will  contribute  to  the \nfaster general development of areas along the corridor and thus to the economy. However, \nthe  economic  development  is  not  attributable  solely  to  highway  improvements.  The,  NTC \nhighways  will  provide  only  limited  links  between  areas  of  potential  production  and  local \nmarkets. Therefore, a conservative approach was taken by not including generated traffic in \nthe  particular  projects.  The  benefits  will  be  restricted  to  those  associated  with  traffic \ndiversion. \n \nTravel  time  values  for  cars  were  estimated  based  on  PRs50  per  hour  for  three \n13. \noccupants  for  travel  during  working  time  (20%  of  total  trips)  and  25%  of  hourly  income  for \nnon-working time trips, i.e., PRs60 per hour. For minibuses and buses, passenger time was \ncalculated as for car drivers but valued on the basis of an hourly income of PRs12.7. Value \nper  vehicle  assumes  an  average  load  of  eight  passengers  in  minibuses,  while  for  large \nbuses  an  average  passenger  occupancy  of  20  was  assumed.  No  value  was  assigned  to \ngoods in transit. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  domestic  prices.  Financial  costs, \n14. \nincluding  physical  contingencies,  were  converted  into  economic  costs  using  a  specific \nconversion factor for civil works of 0.85. \n \nB.  \n\nPeshawar\u2013Torkham Section I Project \n\n1.  \n\nDescription of Project \n\n15. \nThis road forms part of the N-5 arterial road. It will lead westwards from Peshawar in \nNorth-West Frontier Province through Khyber Pass to the Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan international \nborder. The total length of the new road from Peshawar to the border is 51 km; the project \nsection of 34 kilometers (km) commences at the junction between the existing N-5 road and \nthe proposed Peshawar Northern Bypass. The final 17 km ending at the international border \nis  being  constructed  with  ADB  assistance  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  for  the \nNational Highway Development Sector Investment Program.2 \n \n16. \nThe proposed project will construct a new four-lane highway on an alignment to the \nsouth of the existing road. The existing road passes through the towns of Jamrud after about \n6 km and Landikotal about 6 km from the Afghanistan border. The new road will pass very \nclose to the town of Jamrud but will bypass Landikotal about 2 km south of the town center. \n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n17. \nTraffic in 2005 varied from about 8,330 vehicles per day (vpd) at the Peshawar end \nof  the  highway  to  5,400  vpd  between  Jamrud  and  Landikotal  and  to  3,330  vpd  between \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005.

Manila  (RRP:  PAK  36052,  approved  in  22  November,  for \n$770,000,000) \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nLandikotal  and  Torkham.  The  composition  of  traffic  also  varied  with  passenger  car  traffic \nfalling  from about 50% at the  Peshawar  end  to  under  20%  beyond  Landikotal. The  growth \nrate was about 17% per year. \n \n18. \nThe split in traffic on the existing and new roads has been estimated for each vehicle \ncategory. Cars, jeeps, and pick-ups will probably favor the new road, where they can travel \nmore quickly and will make fewer intermediate stops; it is assumed that 75% of the vehicles \nin this category will use the new road. More minibuses will stay on the existing road so they \ncan make frequent intermittent stops in built-up areas: it is assumed that only 33% will divert \nto the new road. It is assumed that large buses will be divided equally between the existing \nand  the  new  road.  Larger,  heavier  trucks  are  more  likely  than  2-axle  trucks  to  be  carrying \ninternational  trade;  it  is  assumed  that  50%  of  2-axle  trucks,  60%  of  3-axles  and  80%  of \narticulated trucks will divert to the new road. \n \n19. \n \n\nThe traffic forecasts of the new road are presented in Table A13.2. \n\nTable A13.2: Traffic Forecast for Peshawar\u2013Torkham Section  \n(number of vehicles) \n\n \n\n \n\nTraffic on \nExisting Road \n2005 \n \n6,356 \n\nTraffic Forecast on New Road  \n(assuming existing road remains open) \n2020 \n \n6,021 \n\n2015 \n \n4,425 \n\n2025 \n \n8,050 \n\n2030 \n \n10,777 \n\n2013 \n \n3,893 \n\nAnnual Average Daily \nTraffic Total \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.  \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nCosts  are  based  on  the  construction  of  a  four-lane  divided  road  with  2-meter \n20. \nshoulders  on  either  side.  Total  costs,  including  civil  works,  physical  contingency,  and \nsupervision, are estimated at PRs6 billion.  \n \n\n \n\n21. \nThe new road will divert an estimated 60% of the traffic from the existing road. Traffic \nretained by the existing road on the section as far as Jamrud will be traffic servicing areas \nalong  the  existing  alignment,  essentially  some  private  cars,  most  minibuses,  and  some \ntrucks, particularly the smaller trucks used for local deliveries. Some public service traffic will \nuse the existing road and some will use the new road. For the evaluation, the existing road \nand  the  new  road  are  assumed  to  share  this  traffic  equally.  Total  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings are estimated to increase from PRs370 million in 2012 to PRs700 million in 2020.  \n \n22. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated at 10.6% (Table A13.3). \nMuch of the benefit will accrue to Afghanistan\u2019s economy, as much of the traffic comprises \nthe transport of international trade with Afghanistan and the carriage of Afghani passengers. \nThe vehicle operating cost savings and time savings used in the present analysis are taken \nas proxies for these benefits to Pakistan. The project is only marginally viable because of the \nhigh capital cost. The likelihood of having only this project implemented is very small given \nthat the Peshawar\u2013Torkham sections 1 and 23 and the Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal (E-4) section \nwill  be  under  ADB  financing.  Construction  of  the  sections  that  will  provide  shorter \nconnections  between  Peshawar  and  Multan  will  result  in  higher  benefits  to  society  and  an \nEIRR  of  14.0%.  Construction  costs  are  based  on  final  draft  of  the  detailed  designs  and \nshould therefore be well within 10.0% of the cost estimates. A cost reduction of 10.0% would \nresult  in  an  EIRR  of  13.0%,  and  a  cost  increase  by  10.0%  will  reduces  it  to  11.4%.    A \nreduction in costs may be achieved when the contract is awarded. In the meantime, in order \nto enhance the project\u2019s worth, NHA will re-examine the design and cost estimates to seek \nsavings  in  areas  that  do  not  compromise  road  strength,  pavement  quality,  or  safety.

There  will  be \nlittle  attraction  for  long-distance  traffic  between  eastern  and  western  Pakistan  to  use  the \nexpressway. \n\n \nTable A13.4: Traffic Forecast for Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal (E-4) \n(number of vehicles) \n\nPotential \ndivertable \ntraffic\n2007\n4,430\n\nDiverted traffic assuming remainder of network \nremains undeveloped\n\n2013\n6,278\n\n2015\n7,678\n\n2020\n10,528\n\n2025\n14,156\n\n2030\n19,055\n\n \n\nTotal AADT\nAADT = annual average daily traffic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n\n                                                 \n4  Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal motorway (E-4).

The total financial cost of implementation over 4 years, including civil works, \nphysical contingency, and supervision is estimated at PRs26 billion. \n \nThe project will divert traffic from existing roads. By extending the M-1, M-2, and M-3 \n27. \nmotorway  network,  it  will  offer  a  higher  speed  link  for  through  traffic  from  the  north  of \nPakistan  and  its  neighbors  to  the  north  and  northwest  to  southern  Punjab,  Sindh,  and  the \nocean ports of Pakistan. Traffic to and from Baluchistan and southern Afghanistan will not be \naffected  significantly.  Benefits  to  diverted  traffic  will  be  realized  as  higher  speeds  attained. \nGenerated benefits directly associated with the project will not be significant. \n \n28. \nThe  project is  economically  viable  with  an  estimated  EIRR  of  15.4%.  (Table  A13.5) \nThis  value  does  not  include  benefits  that  derive  from  reduced  traffic  on  roads  from  which \ntraffic has been diverted. However, much of the congestion on Pakistan\u2019s roads is a result of \nconflict  between  traffic  of  significantly  different  speeds  and  that  conflict  will  remain \nunresolved  unless  traffic  is  better  regulated.  In  addition,  heavily  loaded  trucks  will  be \nreluctant  to  transfer  to  roads  where  load  controls  will  be  more  strictly  monitored  so  road \ndeterioration rates will not be significantly reduced unless monitoring is stricter for the new \nas well as existing roads. A 20.0% cost increase would result in a fall in the EIRR to 13.3%, \nindicating  no  significant  threat  to  the  economic  viability.  The  traffic  growth  rates  have \nassumed sustained economic growth; if growth rates are 20% below the forecast, the EIRR \nwould  fall  to 13.6%. If  the  rate  of  diversion is 20.0%  lower  than  that  estimated,  the  project \nremains economically viable with an EIRR of 13.5%.  \n \n\nTable A13.5: Summary of Results of Economic Analysis  \nfor Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal (E-4) \n(PPRs million) \n \n\nYear \n\nCapital \ncost \n\nNet \nmaintenance \ncost \n\nVehicle \noperating cost \nsavings \n\nTime \nsavings \n\n2007\u20132011 \n2012 \n2015 \n2020 \n2025 \n2030 \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n\n21,886.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n\n0.0 \n2,778.1 \n3,434.4 \n6,510.9 \n6,510.9 \n8,862.8 \n\n0.0 \n214.1 \n262.9 \n490.0 \n490.0 \n662.4 \n\nTotal net \nbenefit \nstream \n\n-21,886.4 \n2,988.6 \n3,693.8 \n6,997.4 \n6,997.4 \n9,521.7 \n15.4% \n\n \n \n\n\fSUMMARY OF SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \n\nI. \n\nBackground \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n63\n\n1. \nThe Government of Pakistan has requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  undertake  the  National  Trade  Corridor  Highway  Investment  Program  (the  Program). \nWith the National Highway Authority (NHA) as the executing agency (EA), the Program will be \nfinanced  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  and  will  finance  road  sections  in  the \nNational  Trade  Corridor.  The  MFF  is  expected  to  have  two  tranches,  each  covering  several \nprojects which in case of new motorways or highways will entail significant land acquisition and \nresettlement  impacts.  MFF  appraisal  includes  the  appraisal  of  the  projects  under  tranche  1: \nsection  1  (kilometer  [km]  1  to  km  34)  of  the  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Expressway  and  the \nFaisalabad\u2013Khanewal expressway (E-4). Projects in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) may \nhave impacts on indigenous people.  \n  \n\nII. \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\n2. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  follow  the  laws  of  Pakistan,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  ADB  Operations  Manual  section  on  involuntary \nsettlement.1 MFF  and  each  tranche  appraisal  and  the  approval  and  implementation  of  each \nproject  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  or  indigenous  people  issues  will  require  the \npreparation of the following documents:  \n\na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  and  an  indigenous  people \ndevelopment  framework  (IPDF)  for  the  whole  MFF  to  be  reviewed,  updated,  and  re-\napproved by ADB annually and before the preparation of each tranche; \n\nan  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  for  each  tranche,  indicating  whether  land \nacquisition and resettlement or indigenous people impacts are expected, and if so their \ntype and magnitude;  \n\na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  for  each  project  with  land  acquisition \nand resettlement with detailed design and impact figures and compensation budgets and \nschedules;2 \n\n(iii) \n\nan indigenous people development plan (IPDP) or relevant indigenous people action for \neach project affecting indigenous people.  \n\n \n3. \nThe appraisal of the MFF and of each tranche and the approval and implementation of \neach  project  under  a  tranche  will  follow  these  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related \nconditions. \n\nMFF  and  tranche  1  appraisal:  preparation  of  a  LARF  and  an  IPDF  for  the  MFF  and \nLARPs and IPDPs (or LARPs that include indigenous people action plans) for all tranche \n1 projects with land acquisition and resettlement or indigenous people impacts.  \n\nOther tranche appraisals: A review and update of the LARF and IPDF and preparation \nof a LARP and an IPDP (or indigenous people actions) for all tranche projects that have \nland acquisition and resettlement or indigenous people impacts. \n\nStart of project civil works: LARP and IPDP implementation. \n\n(iii) \n \n4. \nTo meet these conditions, NHA has prepared a LARF and an IPDF for the whole MFF, \none  LARP  for  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Expressway  section  1,  and  one  LARP  for  expressway  E-4. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Manual (OM Section F2/BP).  \n2  As  noted  in  the  ADB  Operations  Manual  Section  F2/OP  &  BP  (2006),  a  resettlement  plan\u2019s  complexity  rests  on \nimpact severity. If impacts are severe (> 200 people resettled or with >10% income losses), a project is classified as \ncategory  \u201cA\u201d  and  a  full  plan  is  prepared.  If  impacts  are  not  severe  (<200  people  resettled  or  with  <10%  income \nlosses), a project is classified as category \u201cB\u201d and only a short plan is prepared. \n\n(i) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nThe  LARP  for  the  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Expressway  incorporates  the  indigenous  people  action \nplan.  \n\nIII. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n\n \n\n5. \nThe LARF are based on the following principles: (i) land acquisition and resettlement will \nbe avoided or at least minimized; (ii) compensation will guarantee the maintenance of the pre-\nproject  living  standards  of  the  people  affected;  (iii)  those  affected  will  be  fully  informed  and \nconsulted  on  compensation  options;  (iv)  their  sociocultural  institutions  will  be  supported  and \nused; (v) land acquisition and resettlement provisions will apply equally to women and to men; \n(vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation  and/or  rehabilitation;  (vii)  particular \nattention  will  be  paid  to  households  headed  by  women  and  to  vulnerable  groups;  (viii)  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  conceived  and  executed  as  an  integral  part  of  the  project \nand  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  budgets  will  be  included  in  project  costs;  and  \n(ix)  compensation  will  be  fully  provided before  ground  leveling  and demolition.  The  LARF  also \ncover  all  issues  relevant  for  effectively  conducting  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  tasks  so \nthey  comply  with  ADB  policy  (Paras.  7\u201311  of  this  appendix).  It  establishes  the  eligibility  and \ncompensations entitlements as laid out in Table A14.1.   \n \n\nTable A14.1.

NHA  has  overall  responsibility  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  preparation,  implementation  and  financing  and  will  exercise  its  functions  via  a \nproject management unit (PMU) and project implementation units. At the PMU, land acquisition \nand resettlement tasks will be handled by a land acquisition and resettlement unit. This unit will \nbe aided by a social safeguard team under the project preparation and supervision consultants \nand by nongovernmental organizations or impact assessment or valuation consultants hired for \nimpact surveys or monitoring assistance. The PMU will coordinate with local governments that \nhave jurisdiction over land administration and valuation. At the provincial level, these are tasks \nof  the  Board  of  Revenue,  and  at  the  district  level,  they  are  handled  by  the  District  Collector\u2019s \nOffice and the Land Acquisition Collector. Minor agents such as patwari (land record keeper) will \nidentify and verify titles. Compensation for assets other than land or income rehabilitation is the \nresponsibility  of  the  relevant  district  department.  To  ensure  effective  coordination  with  local \ngovernments  and  other  agencies,  NHA  will  establish  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nsteering committee at the provincial level and a land acquisition and resettlement coordinating \ncommittee at the district level. ADB clearance for category B LARPs or IPDPs will be done by a \nsocial development specialist hired at the resident mission. Category A projects will be cleared \nat ADB headquarters.  \n  \nDisclosure  and  public  consultation.  Preparation  of  LARPs  will  require  intensive \n7. \nconsultations with affected persons, the results of which will be fully documented in the LARPs. \nAs  an  appraisal  condition,  LARF  and  LARPs  in  English  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website \nwhile  LARF  and  LARPs  in  the  local  language  (Urdu  and/or  possibly  Pashtu)  will  be  disclosed \nlocally. \n \n8. \nGrievance  procedures.  Grievances  will  first  be  handled  at  the  village  level.  If  no \nsolution  is  reached,  the  persons  affected  will  then  lodge  a  complaint  with  the  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement  unit.  If  no  settlement  is  reached,  the  case  can,  with  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement coordinating committee support, be brought to the PMU. If the grievance remains \nunsettled  after  3  weeks,  the  persons  affected  will  be  able  to  seek  redress  at  the  appropriate \ncourt.  \n \n\n9.   \nMonitoring and evaluation. PMUs  will  internally  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  implementation.  The  EA  will  report  to  ADB  quarterly.  External \nmonitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent  agency  by  the  EA,  and  external  monitoring \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  a  year.  At  the  end  of  project  implementation,  the \nindependent  monitoring  agency  will  carry  out  a  general  evaluation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement implementation. \n \n10. \nFinances  and  schedules. The LARF prescribes that each LARP include detailed land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  budgets  and  provide  clear  schedules  linking  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \n\nIV. \n\nIndigenous People Issues \n\n11. \nIndigenous people will be affected only by projects in NWFP tribal areas. No area with \ngroups  fitting ADB\u2019s  definition  of indigenous  people  will be  affected in  Punjab.  The LARP for \nsection  1  of  the  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Expressway  includes  the  required  indigenous  people \naction plan. To comply with ADB\u2019s indigenous people policy provisions, NHA has also drafted \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nan  IPDF  for  the  whole  MFF  detailing  (i)  project  processing  conditions  relating  to  indigenous \npeople;  (ii)  IPDP  preparation  or  implementation  requirements;  (iii)  definitions  of  indigenous \npeople  in  Pakistan;  (iv)  results  of  a  general  social  assessment;  (v)  an  indigenous  people \nstrategy  for  the  Program  and  the  type  of  action  related  to  indigenous  people  that  is  needed;  \n(vi) IPDP participation instruments; and (vii) general processing and implementation issues. \n \nBased  on IPDF  provisions  and the  results  of  the  social  assessment,  it  is  assumed  that \n12. \nPakistan\u2019s  definition  of  \u201ctribal  peoples\u201d  fits  ADB\u2019s  definition  of  \u201cindigenous  people\u201d.  Therefore \n\u201ctribal  peoples\u201d  will  be  substituted  for  \u201cindigenous  people\u201d  in  the  preparation  of  specific \ndocuments.  Also,  based  on  IPDF  provisions,  the  appraisal  of  each  tranche  will  include  an \nindigenous peoples identification assessment (IPIA) providing (i) general information on projects \nlikely to affect indigenous peoples, the relative magnitude of impact expected, and the number \nor type of IPDPs to be prepared ,and (ii) an outline of indigenous people groups to be affected, \nincluding  an  overview  of  their  demography,  social  organization,  livelihood  or  land  tenure \nfeatures, relations with government or other groups, adaptation to outside society or culture, and \nlocal governance. \n\n13. \nand the situation. This action will be of two types. \n\nThe IPDF also indicates the type of actions needed, based on the magnitude of impacts \n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIf impacts affecting indigenous people are limited to land acquisition and resettlement but \nhave  no  broad  community  or  systemic  effect  requiring  the  rehabilitation  of  an  entire \nproduction system, specific actions related to indigenous people will be integrated in the \ntext of the LARP.   \n \nIf  impacts  affecting  indigenous  people  go  beyond  standard  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  effects  and cause  broad disruption  with  systemic sociocultural  dimensions \nand  wide  economic  and  community  effects,  a  stand-alone  IPDP,  including  a  detailed \naction  plan,  schedules,  and  budgets,  will  be  prepared.  The  stand-alone  IPDP  will  not \nonly cover land acquisition and resettlement issues, it will also provide a detailed action \nplan  based  on  direct  participation  by  indigenous  people  in  the  socio-economic \nrehabilitation  of  the  affected  communities,  including  providing  community  development \npackages. \n\n \n14. \nInstitutional  responsibilities.  Based  on  the  IPDF,  NHA  has  overall  responsibility  for \nactions related to indigenous people, including IPDP preparation, implementation, financing, and \nmonitoring through the PMU and the project implementation units. The PMU will be assisted by \nthe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit  and  the  social  safeguard  team  under  the  project \npreparation and supervision consultants and by nongovernmental organizations in project areas. \nThe  PMU  will  coordinate  with  local  government  authorities  in  tribal  areas  and  with  indigenous \npeople  communal  organizations  and  will  carry  out  all  activities  related  to  indigenous  people  in \nsuch  a  way  as  to  follow  the  administrative  or  political  process  prevalent  in  tribal  areas.  In \nparticular,  the  PMU  will  carry  out  these  tasks  together  with  the  political  agent  and  the  district \ncoordinators\u2019  offices  and  through  them  make  workable  arrangements  with  concerned  tribal \nleaders (maliks, sardars and/or khans) who in turn will consult their tribal councils (Jirgas) and/or \ncommunities  to  make  the  final  decisions  and  take  necessary  actions  in  line  with  the  project\u2019s \nrequirements. To ensure coordination with tribal territorial governments, political agents will be \nmembers of the land acquisition and resettlement steering committee in NWFP and of the land \nacquisition and resettlement coordinating committee at the district level.  \n  \n15. \nComplaints  and  grievances.  Complaints  from  affected  indigenous  people  will  be \naddressed to the political agent\u2019s office via tribal leaders and councils. If convinced, the political \nagent  will  then  call  on  the  PMU  or  NHA  headquarters  to  discuss,  negotiate,  and  resolve  the \nissues at hand. If NHA, the political agent, and the tribal leaders cannot find mutually agreeable \nsolutions to a grievance, the project will not be implemented.  \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n67\n\nI6. \nPublic  consultation  and  disclosure.  Indigenous  people  tasks  will  be  planned  and \nexecuted  on  the  basis  of  intense  consultations  with  affected  communities  and  will  entail  the \nsigning of specific land acquisition agreements by the tribal elders, the political agent, and NHA.  \n \n17. \nAs  an  appraisal  condition,  IPDF  and  IPDPs  in  English  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite while IPDF and IPDPs in local languages (Urdu and/or possibly Pashtu) will be posted \nlocally.  \n \n\n18.  Monitoring and evaluation. Internal monitoring of IPDP implementation will be done by \nthe  PMU  and  reported  to  NHA.  NHA  will  report  to  ADB  quarterly.  External  monitoring  will  be \nassigned to an independent agency by NHA, and external monitoring reports will be submitted \nto ADB once a year. At the end of project implementation, the independent monitoring agency \nwill carry out a general evaluation of IPDP implementation. \n \n19. \nFinances  and  schedules.  The  IPDF  prescribes  that  each  stand-alone  IPDP  will  detail \nbudgets  and  provide  clear  schedules  linking  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  tasks  with  the \ninitiation of civil works. \n \n\nV. \n\nImpacts of Tranche 1 Projects \n\n \n\n20. \nTranche  1  of  the  MFF  covers  two  projects:  (i)  the  Peshawar-Torkham  Expressway \nsection  1,  and  (ii)  the  Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal  expressway  (E-4).  LARPs  were  prepared  for \nthese two projects and have been included in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n21.  The  Peshawar-Torkham  Expressway  (E-1)  will  affect  88  households  (2,417  affected \npersons) who will lose 121 structures (36 houses, 67 shops or commercial structures and 18 \ndismantled houses). Nearly 179.37 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, of which 1.43 ha is \nprivate  residential  or  commercial  plots  and  177.94  ha  communal  land  belonging  to  various \nPathan  clans  of  the  Afridi  tribe.  Land  losses  will  have  minimal  impact  on  livelihood  as  the \naffected  areas  are  essentially  barren,  stony  hills.  The  overall  budget  for  the  resettlement \ncomponent is estimated to PRs643.89 million. \n \n22. \nE-4,  will  affect  9,209  households  (9,050  households  loose  land\u20148,113  as  owners, \n727 as tenants and 210 as lease holders) with an overall population of 65,370 persons; of \nthese,  207  families  will  lose  a  house  and  19  will  lose  businesses.  Other  impacts  include  1 \nmosque,  1  school,  5  tube  wells,  5  cattle  yards,  3  shops,  2  brick  kilns,  a  poultry  farm,  a \nhatchery, a soap factory and a petrol pump that will be affected to varying degrees. Finally, a \ntotal  of  18,000  wood  trees  and  13,295  fruit  trees  will  be  affected.  Costs  of  LARP \nimplementation  are  estimated  at  PRs6.45  billion  (inclusive  of  impacts,  compensation, \nadministrative costs, and contingencies) \n \n\n \n\n\fSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n68 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nA. \n\nLinks to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?  \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty Reduction: \nBased  on  an  analysis  of  the  determinants  of  poverty,  Pakistan\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  explicitly \nrecognizes  that,  while  economic  growth  and  service  delivery  are  crucial  for  poverty  reduction, \ninfrastructure  development  (including  aviation,  ports,  railways,  and  roads)  is  critical  as  a  catalyst  for \ngenerating  economic  activity,  employment,  and  accelerating  growth.  Better  transport  infrastructure  also \nhelps  to  integrate  Pakistan\u2019s  provinces  and  regions.  Increases  in  trade  with  neighboring  countries \nfacilitated through highways and other means contributes to macroeconomic stability and reduces risks of \nshocks for the vulnerable poor.  \n \nConsultations with local communities during poverty reduction strategy formulation indicated that the need \nfor  improved  connectivity  and  access  to  markets  through  rural  roads  was  a  key  issue  for  the  poor.  The \nprovision  of  electricity  was  another.  Rural\u2013urban  links  promoted  through  improvements  in  highways  and \nroads help to ensure greater stability of income and more off-farm employment in rural areas, where the \nmajority  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  and  the  poor  live.  In  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy, ADB recognizes the potential of subregional cooperation through the better transportation links. \nTransportation is expected to contribute to macroeconomic growth and to increase revenue to the national \ngovernment (and therefore indirectly to lead to an increase in social spending that benefits the poor, who \nhave a disproportionate interest in public social spending). In addition, better accessibility helps reduce the \nurban\u2013rural  gap  and  leads  to  more  economic  activity,  generating  off-farm  employment  for  the  poor. \nHowever,  macroeconomic  growth  in  Pakistan  will  not  necessarily  translate  into  reductions  in  the  social \ngap.1 \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nPoverty Classification : General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe number of poor2 in Pakistan more than doubled in the 1990s, increasing to 45 million in 1999. Of this \nfigure, 33 million or 73% (4.7 million households), were estimated to live in rural areas. Moreover, Pakistan \nranks poorly in major social indicators: the infant mortality rate in rural areas is 106 per 1,000 live births \nand the percentage of malnourished children under 5 is 39%. An important feature of poverty in Pakistan \nis the clustering of incomes around the poverty line, as 40.5% of the nation\u2019s population falls in a narrow \nincome range around this line. Approximately 12.2% of the total population may be classed as chronically \nor extremely poor. According to a Social Policy Development Center assessment (1990-2000), over a 10-\nyear period the disposable income of the top income quintile grew in real terms by 23%, while that of the \nlowest  quintile  grew  by  3%,  increasing  the  gap  between  the  rich  and  the  poor.3 Factors  that  affect  the \nlivelihood  of  the  poor  include  (i)  low  literacy;  (ii)  lack  of  access  to  appropriate  technologies,  government \nextension services, off-farm employment opportunities, and formal credit; (iii) social exclusion; (iv) gender \ndiscrimination; (v) exclusion from benefit of development projects; and (vi) poor service delivery.  \nThe direct impact of the projects on the poor is not expected to be substantial, since the roads would not \nbe  primary  roads.  Instead,  they  are  partially  limited  access  or  limited  access  roads,  motorways,  and \nexpressways.  Benefits  for  the  poor  would  take  the  form  of  improved  local  employment  prospects  during \nproject construction. The projects will create significant employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled \nlabor during implementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly in road construction, rehabilitation, \nand  maintenance  and  indirectly  in  providing  materials  and  services  for  contractors.  The  projects  will \ngenerate approximately 26,000 person-months of unskilled labor \n\nC.

Pakistan - Poverty Assessment. Washington DC. \n2   The official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories/day/adult, equivalent to PRs750 per month in the 2002 \nPRSP. This was calculated at 2000\u20132001 prices. Inflation has increased it to PRs850 per adult equivalent per \nmonth at 2004 prices (Economic Survey of Pakistan 2004).   \n\n No \n No \n\n3  Social Policy Development Center Annual Report 2001. \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n69\n\nParticipation,  consultation,  and  information  dissemination  were  incorporated  at  several  levels  during  the \nplanning  of  tranche  1  projects  while  (i)  validating  principles  on which  entitlements  for  compensation  and \ncompensation levels specified in the entitlement matrix for the project are based; (ii) forming committees of \npeople  affected;  and  (iii)  minimizing  adverse  impacts,  exploring  alternate  alignments,  and  restricting \ndesign to adjust to available space. \n \nThe  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  will  ensure  that  implementation  will  involve  local  groups  in \n(i) preparing final compensation listings and individual claim files and in the payment of compensation for \nacquired  land  and  loss  of  assets  and  livelihood;  (ii)  consultations  with  displaced  people  and  host \ncommunities  on  relocation  options  if  relocation  is  necessary;  (iii)  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nCoordinating Committee (which will include representatives from affected people and NHA and will serve \nas a liaison with the project for compensation matters, technical design, and construction issues and will \nparticipate  in  any  grievance  redress);  and  (iv)  monitoring  and  evaluation  during  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan.  \n  \nD.  Gender And Development \n\nWomen will be able to benefit from the program through improved access to basic services such as health, \neducation,  and  clean  water.  Additional  assistance  to  households  headed  by  women  will  be  provided  as \npart  of  the  resettlement  plan.  There are  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  of  women  or  children \nthat may  be  aggravated improving  connections  to  and  from  project  areas.  However,  the  project  aims  to \naddress these issues through its mitigating measures. \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \nE.
