I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan of \nup to $200,000,000 to Axis Bank Limited (ABL); (ii) a proposed loan of up to $200,000,000 (or Indian \nrupee equivalent) to YES Bank Limited (YBL); and (iii) proposed capacity development technical \nassistance (TA) of up to $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF - other sources) to ABL and YBL for the Strengthening Rural Financial Inclusion \nand Farmer Access to Markets Project in India.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n1.  The Rural Economy \n \n2.  Despite the impressive reduction in poverty, most Indians, especially in rural areas, cannot \nmeet their basic needs. Economic and financial sector reforms that originated in the 1990s resulted \nin sustained economic growth with a gross domestic product (GDP) compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 7.5% during 2000\u20132012, outperforming India\u2019s GDP CAGR of 4.5% during the preceding \nfour decades by a wide margin. Strong economic  performance coupled with slower population \ngrowth has resulted in a dramatic improvement in India\u2019s poverty headcount index, which fell from \n66% in 1977 to 33% in 2009.2 Despite this considerable improvement, recent research underscores \nthat about 680 million Indians, or 56% of the population, continue to lack the income and safety nets \nrequired to meet their essential needs, most of whom are rural dwellers.3 Of particular concern is the \nlagging performance of agriculture, which is the primary source of rural employment and income. \n \n3.  The  importance  of  agriculture  to  the  economic  and  social  fabric  goes  well  beyond  its \ncontribution to GDP. Agriculture has not kept pace with recent growth in India\u2019s broader economy, \nas productivity has stagnated. Based on recent estimates, agricultural productivity per worker in \nIndia is 60% lower than that of construction and 75% lower than that of manufacturing. Despite \nsignificant improvement in recent decades, India\u2019s agricultural crop yields remain substantially below \nthose of its Southeast and East Asian peers\u2014ranging from 10% to 50% (with the exception of \nwheat).  This  has  adversely  impacted  the  agriculture  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  GDP,  which  has \ndecreased considerably from 42% in 1961 to 17% in 2012. In spite of this decline, agriculture \ncontinues to play the predominant role in the rural economy, which comprises some 68% of India\u2019s \npopulation, providing 73% of rural employment (much of it undertaken by women) and generating \n52% of rural household income.4 The importance of agriculture sector productivity is central to the \ndevelopment of the rural economy. Improving the productivity and performance of the agriculture \nsector is the most direct route to addressing rural poverty. \n \n4.  Structural issues and inefficiencies contribute to low agricultural productivity. While crop, \nfood, and livestock production growth have exceeded population growth since 2009, low agriculture \ngrowth and productivity are general problems across crops and regions, although large interstate \nyield  differences  exist.5 Low  agricultural  productivity  in  India  stems  from  a  number  of  factors, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Measured  at  $2  per  day  purchasing  power  parity.

Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2013. Country \nProgram and Strategy: India, 2013\u20132015. Manila (Gender Assessment). \n5  Punjab\u2019s grain yield per hectare (2011\u20132012) exceeded that of Odisha and Rajasthan more than three times. Important \nfactors explaining the difference are tractor intensity, the use of fertilizer, the availability of irrigated land, and, perhaps \n \n ", "2 \n \nincluding  (i)  slow  progress  on  land  reforms,  (ii)  inefficient  state-controlled  input  supply  and \nmarketing, (iii) inadequate irrigation infrastructure resulting in high dependence on rainfall,6 (iv) \nlimited research and slow adoption of modern agricultural practices and technologies, (v) weak \nintegration of farmers into the value chains of agribusiness companies, and (vi) limited and costly \naccess to financial services for farmers. \n \n5.  Agriculture production has been put under greater stress with the emergence of the middle \nclass. India\u2019s solid GDP growth has improved personal income levels and facilitated the emergence \nof a growing middle class7\u2014a trend that is expected to gain strength over the medium term. Growing \nincome and the expansion of the urban population at a rate of 10 million persons per year has \nresulted in rising demand for quality food and beverage products, which is outpacing the growth of \nsupply. The surge in food prices since 2007 underscores the increasing demand\u2013supply gap and \npoints to the tremendous need to improve India\u2019s agriculture productivity. \n \n2.  Rural Financial Inclusion and the Role of Private Sector Banking \n \n6.  Despite notable improvements, rural residents have inadequate access to finance. Since the \n1990s, financial sector reforms in India have improved the operating environment for banks. In \nparticular,  the  deregulation  of  interest  rates  and  the  entry  of  new  private  sector  banks  have \nintensified competition, improved sector performance, and enhanced service coverage. Largely as a \nresult, private sector credit has grown significantly, up from 25% of GDP in 1990 to 51% in 2012. \nWhile the government runs sizeable subsidized lending programs to reach the unbanked, it has \nincreasingly recognized the limited sustainability of such interventions and has acknowledged that a \ncommercial  business  banking  approach  is  needed.  To  ensure  that  banks  place  reasonable \nemphasis on serving the lower-income segments, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) instituted priority \nsector lending (PSL) policies requiring banks to lend at least 40% of their net credit of the previous \nyear to priority sectors. The PSL targets include, among others, agriculture (18%) and economically \nweaker sectors (10%). Notwithstanding such policies, banks have not met these PSL targets and \nimproving rural financial inclusion has remained a challenge. \n \n7.  Low financial services depth in agriculture is a major impediment to investment. Agriculture \ngenerated more than 17%\u201319% of GDP during 2007\u20132012, yet the sector only received 11%\u201312% \nof institutional credit. Limited access to affordable funding is the key factor constraining investment \nby India\u2019s 120 million small farmers. Banking services typically provided to farmers are usually \nlimited  to  basic  payments  and  deposits  and  to  a  minimal  extent,  credit,  as  traditional  lending \nprocesses require collateral documentation and financial statements that most farmers are unable to \nproduce.  Services  customized  to  a  farmer\u2019s  cash  flow,  for  instance,  are  still  in  their  infancy. \nHowever, creative solutions such as cash flow-based lending are needed to address the interrelated \nchallenge of limited financial inclusion and low agricultural productivity. \n   \n8.  To address these intertwined challenges and to maximize development impact by reaching a \nlarge number of small farmers to whom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) cannot lend directly, \nADB conducted a search of potential high-quality private banks with broad reach in rural areas, \nsuccessful lending programs serving small farmers, and which were willing to partner with ADB to \n                                                                                                                                                              \neven more so, the use of farm credit. Farm credit in Punjab exceeded that of Odisha by more than 10 times; and \ncontributed to farmer access to improved inputs and management for maintaining soil fertility, seed quality and irrigation, \nas well as the application of adequate farming techniques and post-harvest management supported by capital, research, \nand land titling\u2014all of which can have a critical impact on agricultural yields. \n6  Nearly 70% of the net sown area is in rain-fed agriculture. \n7  Some 20% of India\u2019s 240 million households can be characterized as high to upper-middle income (>$7,400/annum), \nwhile 30% are lower-middle income (>$3,300\u2264$7,400/annum) and 50% are low-income. The upper-middle-income \nsegment spends 20%\u201335% of their income on food and beverages, while the lower-middle-income segment spends up \nto 45% on this expenditure item. The average Indian household spends 31% on food and beverages. \n ", "3 \ndeepen rural financial inclusion. Two commercial banks were identified\u2014ABL, India\u2019s third largest \nprivate bank, and YBL, the fourth largest. Through dedicated inclusive business units, which target \nagriculture  and  financial  inclusion,  both  banks  have  initiated  the  development  of  innovative \ncommercial  inclusive  finance  solutions  for  the  rural  unbanked,  particularly  women,  and  better \nintegration of farmers in the agriculture value chain. \n \nB.  Axis Bank Limited \n9.  Business overview and strategy. Established in 1994, ABL is India\u2019s third largest private \nbank with total assets of Rs3,832 billion ($63.96 billion, end of FY2014) . Since FY2011, ABL has \ndiversified its asset mix by expanding its retail franchise and strengthening its small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) lending, and has grown its distribution network to 2,402 branches in 29 \nstates & 5 Union Territories. ABL\u2019s business strategy leverages on domestic growth opportunities. \nABL regards agricultural lending and financial inclusion as an integral component of its rural strategy \nto further extend its reach in the rural market.. \n \n10.  Ownership.  ABL  was  founded  by  its  state-owned  promoters\u2014Unit  Trust  of  India, \nsubsequently the administrator of the Special Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI); Life \nInsurance Corporation of India (LIC); General Insurance Corporation of India; and four other public \nsector insurance companies. ABL is listed on the national and Bombay stock exchanges. Following \nthe March 2014 sale of share capital by SUUTI, state ownership fell to 29.2%, with LIC holding \n13.5% and SUUTI 11.7% as of 30 June 2014. Ownership is well diversified, with 59.5% held by \nprivate institutional investors, and 8.0% by private non-institutional investors (corporates and/or \nindividuals), each holding below 5% interest\u2014the RBI significance threshold level. \n \n11.  Management  and  governance.  Consistent  with  the  listing  requirements  of  the  stock \nexchanges, RBI, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations, as on 31st March, \n2014 ABL is controlled by a 14-member board of directors, half of whom are independent. The board \nis well supported by a system of committees, including the committee of directors; and the audit, \nhuman  resources  and  remuneration,  risk  management,  customer  service,  and  information \ntechnology  strategy  committees.  ABL\u2019s  senior  management,  responsible  for  day-to-day \nmanagement of ABL, is led by Mrs. S. Sharma and consists of 20 other senior managers, all \nexperienced professionals who head business lines, business support, and independent risk and \ncontrol functions. ABL has a centralized decision-making model with policy and approvals provided \nby the head office in Mumbai, while its branches focus on customer relationships. \n \n12.  Capital adequacy. ABL has maintained sound capital adequacy over FY2011\u2013FY2014, as \ncapital growth has kept pace with the rise in risk-weighted assets. In line with RBI regulations, ABL \nbegan the phased transition to Basel III capital adequacy guidelines in April 2013. As a result of the \nchange in treatment of Tier 2 capital in the computation of the capital charge, ABL\u2019s total capital ratio \nslightly declined from the previous year to 16.1% as of the end of FY2014, while the Tier 1 capital \nratio increased to 12.6%. \n \n13. Loan portfolio and asset quality. After loan portfolio growth of 19.2% in FY2012, its pace \nslowed moderately to 16.0% in FY2013 and to 16.8% in FY2014. Despite the macroeconomic \nslowdown, asset quality has remained stable with ABL pursuing new lending opportunities targeting \nhighly rated companies. Contrastingly, and consistent with ABL\u2019s diversification strategy, the retail \nportfolio grew at a CAGR of almost 39.0% per annum during FY2011\u2013FY2014. ABL\u2019s agricultural \nand SME portfolio growth has increased since FY2011, rising by 19.1% in FY2014.  \n \n13.  Funding. The Bank is primarily funded through its stable deposit base. ABL has issued \nsubordinated bonds and entered into bilateral placements overseas to raise short- to medium-term \nfunds (1- to 3-year tenor). ABL has an annual funding plan to raise at least $1 billion during FY2015\u2013\nFY2017, which it plans to close through offshore issuances via medium-term notes, bilateral and \n ", "4 \n \nclub loans, in addition to sourcing funds from entities such as international financial institutions \n(IFIs).  \n \n14.  Earnings performance. ABL\u2019s net income grew at a CAGR of 22.4% over FY2011\u2013FY2014, \nfrom Rs33.9 billion to Rs62.2 billion. Helped by the diversification in assets toward the higher-\nyielding retail portfolio and a deposit-dominated low-cost funding base, net interest income growth \nwas healthy, rising by 20.6% in FY2013 and by 23.6% in FY2014. Fee income also increased, \nclimbing by 16.8% in FY2013 before slowing to 8.4% in FY2014. ABL\u2019s profitability remained sound \nin 2014, with a return on average assets (ROAA) of 1.8% and a return on average equity (ROAE) of \n18.2%. \n \nC.  YES Bank Limited \n15.  Business overview and strategy. Established in 2004, YBL is India\u2019s fourth largest private \nbank with total assets of Rs1,090 billion ($17.7 billion) as of the end of FY2014. YBL\u2019s corporate, \nretail, SME, and inclusive business platforms offer comprehensive services through its network of \n560 branches. Acting largely as a wholesale bank during its early years, YBL under its 2010\u20132015 \nstrategy is diversifying its portfolio by emphasizing growth in its retail and inclusive and social \nbusiness  lines.  YBL\u2019s  Inclusive  and  Social  Banking  Division,  through  its  YES  Livelihood \nEnhancement  Action  Program,  focuses  on  developing  outreach  to  small  farmers,  using  YBL\u2019s \nagribusiness corporate relationships, and low-income women self-help groups (SHGs) in villages, in \npartnership with its business correspondents acting as service intermediaries.8 \n \n16.  Ownership. The founders, R. Kapoor and the family of the late A. Kapur, collectively own \n22.2% of YBL\u2019s share capital. The remaining 77.8% of the shares are held by insurance companies \n(of which LIC holds the largest 7.4% interest), foreign institutional investors, and mutual funds, which \nown 60.6%, and individuals and trusts, which own 9.8%. YBL shares are listed on both the national \nand Bombay exchanges. Except for the founders and LIC, all shareholders are below the RBI \nsignificance threshold of 5.0%. \n \n17.  Management and governance. Daily management of YBL is undertaken by an experienced \nmanagement team headed by  R. Kapoor, a well-established businessman, who previously  co-\nfounded  Rabobank\u2019s  Indian  corporate  finance  and  investment  banking  subsidiary,  Rabo  India \nFinance  Pvt.  Ltd.  YBL\u2019s  10-member  board  is  composed  of  seven  independent  directors.  The \nremaining  directors  include  R.  Kapoor,  as  both  promoter  and  chief  executive  officer,  and  two \nnonexecutive, non-independent directors. Responsible for policy formulation, strategy, performance \noversight, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the board is adequately supported \nby  committees,  including  the  audit,  risk  monitoring,  capital  raising,  and  information  technology \nstrategy committees.  \n \n18.  Capital adequacy. YBL has demonstrated its ability to raise capital to support its asset \ngrowth,  as  evidenced  by  its  initial  public  offering  in  FY2005  and  its  four  subsequent  market \nplacements, as well as internal capital generation through retained earnings and perpetual debt \ninstruments. Subsequent to its placement of $500 million on 30 May 2014, YBL\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio \nstrengthened to 13.0%, while the total capital ratio rose to 18.0%\u2014well above the RBI prudential \nlimit. The May 2014 placement was five times oversubscribed, highlighting strong international and \ndomestic confidence in YBL. \n \n                                                \n8 Business correspondents in India are organized as companies or nongovernment organizations with in-depth experience \nin forming and managing self-help groups. Business correspondents that are affiliated with microfinance companies \nhave the additional benefit of skills in customer credit evaluation and management.     \n ", "5 \n19.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. From FY2011 to FY2014, YBL\u2019s loan portfolio grew at a \nCAGR of 17.4%. Although large companies continue to comprise the largest part of its loans, \nlending to this segment decreased in FY2014 in line with YBL\u2019s risk and income diversification \nstrategy. Retail, which includes inclusive and social banking, experienced the highest loan growth, \nmore than doubling in FY2014. YBL\u2019s inclusive and social lending activities involve lending to SHGs \ncoordinated by selected business correspondents. Although from a low base, YBL\u2019s inclusive and \nsocial banking exposure tripled in FY2014 to Rs6.6 billion. YBL is also interested in developing its \nagribusiness portfolio, seeing significant growth potential in agribusiness, particularly value chain \ndirect farmer lending. During FY2012\u2013FY2014, YBL\u2019s agribusiness portfolio expanded at an average \nof 13.0% per annum to reach Rs63.2 billion as of the end of FY2014. YBL\u2019s asset quality is strong \ncompared  with  its  private  bank  peers.  Asset  quality  of  YBL\u2019s  agriculture-related  portfolio  also \nremained solid, with a gross NPA ratio (RBI definition) of 0.03% as of the end of FY2014, down from \n0.16% as of the end of FY2012. \n \n20.  Funding. In spite of high inflation during the past few years, YBL\u2019s deposits have grown \nbriskly, rising by over 36.0% in FY2013 and by another 10.8% in FY2014. YBL\u2019s deposit mobilization \nhas shifted from more volatile corporate deposits toward more diversified, albeit short-term, retail \ndeposits as a key funding source. Current and savings accounts represented 22.0% of deposits as \nof the end of FY2014. To address YBL\u2019s need for longer and more stable funding, borrowings, \nparticularly from IFIs, have become increasingly important\u2014funding an annual average of $924 \nmillion during FY2011\u2013FY2014. \n \n21.  Earnings performance. YBL\u2019s earnings have been consistently strong, with net income \nincreasing from Rs7.3 billion in FY2011 to Rs16.2 billion in FY2014 (CAGR of 30.5%). Income \ngrowth during FY2011\u2013FY2014 has been supported by strong growth in net interest income (CAGR \nof 29.6%) and fee income (CAGR of 29.0%). YBL\u2019s profitability is strong, with ROAA exceeding \n1.5% and return on equity exceeding 20.0% since FY2009. In FY2014, ROAA was 1.6% and return \non equity was 25.0%. \n \nD.  Unique Features \n22.  The project would constitute ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign intervention in India that targets small \nfarmers and low-income women through private banks. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n23.  The assistance includes two senior unsecured loans, one of up to $200 million (or Indian \nrupee equivalent) with a 7-year tenor to YBL and a second of up to $200 million with a 7-year tenor \nto ABL, and a capacity development TA grant of up to $2 million to both ABL and YBL. In line with \nADB policies, both banks will lend the Indian rupee equivalent amount of ADB\u2019s aggregate loan \ndisbursements to eligible borrowers to finance working capital and investment loans targeting (i) \nsmall farm households, and (ii) rural women, organized in either savings and credit SHGs or joint \nliability groups. In line with ADB\u2019s cofinancing strategy, a portion of the risk on ADB\u2019s loans may be \ntransferred to counterparties.9 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  Dedicated agriculture and inclusive business credit teams in ABL and YBL will select and \nmonitor  the  subloans  consistent  with  both  banks\u2019  lending  policies  and  performance-tracking \n                                                \n9  The terms of the risk transfer agreements, if any, will be subject to approval by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. \n ", "6 \n \nsystems. ABL and YBL will each provide (i) annual financial statements; (ii) quarterly compliance \ncertificates  for  agreed  covenants;  (iii)  semiannual  progress  updates  on  (a)  their  rural  service \noutreach, (b) the use of subloans, (c) progress updates on relevant design and monitoring (DMF) \nindicators,  and  (d)  progress  updates  on  the  TA  implementation  and  impact;  and  (iv)  annual \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) reports. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n25.  The ADB assistance is expected to have the following value additions: \n(i)  Support  of  scalable  lending  models  for  priority  sectors  and  inclusive \nagriculture  growth. The current level of commercial bank  lending to agriculture \nremains inadequate and limited access to finance for the rural population limits their \nability to undertake critical investments to improve yields and income. Although ABL \nand YBL have done some successful groundwork since 2010 in developing lending \nmodels for supporting small farms and rural women, the banks still remain below the \nRBI-instituted PSL targets. By channeling funds and providing TA to ABL and YBL for \nlending to small farmers and rural women, ADB\u2019s support will not only contribute \nappreciably towards both banks\u2019 efforts to meet PSL targets, but also signal to the \nmarket and catalyze more local bank finance to support the development of this \nimportant sector, helping to alleviate rural poverty. \n(ii)  Strengthening  the  banking  sector  by  providing  bank  access  to  long-term \nfunding. Banks in India largely lend from short-term, less stable deposits because of \ndifficulties in sourcing sufficient long-term financing, given the developing nature of \nthe country\u2019s financial sector. Increasing competition for deposits and the Basel III \nmandated  need  for  more  stable  funding  sources  requires  banks  to  borrow  from \ndiversified sources to fill large funding gaps, including IFIs. ADB\u2019s loans will make a \nsizeable contribution to ABL and YBL\u2019s funding in support of rural financial inclusion. \n(iii)  Technical  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  directly  complement  ADB\u2019s  credit  lines, \nsupporting  the  buildup  of  both  banks\u2019  inclusive  business  strategies  via  business \ncorrespondents  and targeted  lending  products  to  small farmers,  using  innovative \napproaches for linking them to markets. ADB\u2019s TA will help improve the integrity of \ncredit data at the farmer level, and enhance credit assessment and risk management \nat both banks, which will benefit farmers with improved access to credit. With ADB\u2019s \nassistance, the banks\u2019 business models can become scalable and replicable flagship \ninitiatives to support inclusive and commercially viable approaches to funding farmers \nand women borrowers through SHGs. \n(iv)  Effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  assistance  includes  a  comprehensive \napproach to improve YBL\u2019s ability to reach an additional 2.5 million rural, low-income \nwomen.  This  includes  women\u2019s  awareness  of  financial  planning,  savings,  and \nborrowing for their farm and household needs as reflected in the gender action plan.  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n26.  The expected impact is improved financial inclusion for small farmers and women SHGs, as \nmeasured by commercial banks reaching at least 14.4% of the RBI PSL target for agriculture by \n2025 and an increase in the volume of bank loans to women SHGs. \n27.  The expected outcome of the intervention is that ABL and YBL will have established scalable \nfinancing models for sustainable outreach to small farmers and women SHGs. This will be reflected \nby growth in both banks\u2019 small farmer and women SHG portfolios and borrower numbers, while \nmaintaining adequate asset quality. The provision of financial services to small farmers and women \n ", "7 \nSHGs and their integration into formal agribusiness supply chains will increase farmer income and \nemployment. \n28.  The expected outputs of the investments are (i) ABL and YBL banking services to small \nfarmers and women SHGs expanded, (ii) operating and risk management systems improved, (iii) \nwomen SHG financial literacy improved, and (iv) compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) ensured. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n29.  Under the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen the financial sector by \npromoting inclusive growth.10 Inclusive finance will be supported by the focus on rural areas where \nproductivity is low and the potential for income generation is high. The assistance is also consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India,11 which highlights the importance of \ninclusive growth through inclusive financial systems. ADB will assist both banks to expand their \nservices to small farmers and low-income women, which is consistent with the government\u2019s efforts \nas  emphasized  in  the  Mor  Report.12 ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  support  will  complement  earlier  and \nongoing sovereign efforts in capital market and rural credit cooperative restructuring, as well as \nagribusiness infrastructure development.13 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n30.  The loans are classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and FI treated as C \nfor involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. No subloans classified environment category \nA may be financed under the loans. The potential environmental and social impacts of the loans and \nassociated  risks  have  been  assessed,  as  well  as  the  banks\u2019  commitment  and  capacity  for \nenvironmental  and  social  management.  ABL  and  YBL  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment \nactivities list,  ensure that investments using  ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations, comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and establish and maintain an \nESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement of the loans.14 ABL\u2019s and YBL\u2019s ESMS will include \narrangements to comply with national labor laws and ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.15 \n \n31.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Through its YES Livelihood \nEnhancement Action Program, YBL services 530,000 rural women, organized via SHGs across 16 \nstates,  including  eight  priority  states  identified  by  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment. YBL has 35 accredited business correspondents that source and service the SHGs. \nUnder YBL\u2019s current business strategy and ADB\u2019s assistance, YBL aims to increase the number of \nlow-income women in rural areas that it services to 3 million. To operationalize that goal, YBL is \nstrengthening its outreach to women SHGs via business correspondents, enhancing YBL field staff \npresence, and concentrating processing into dedicated regional hubs. \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2014.

ABL and YBL were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure \nthat the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Assurances \n33.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),16 the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance \nto ABL and YBL for the Strengthening Rural Financial Inclusion and Farmer Access to Markets \nProject. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans and technical assistance grant would comply with the \nArticles  of  Agreement of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n(i)  a loan of up to $200,000,000 to Axis Bank Limited; \n(ii)  a loan of up to $200,000,000 (or Indian rupee equivalent) to YES Bank Limited; and \n(iii)  technical assistance of up to $2,000,000 to Axis Bank Limited and YES Bank Limited  \n \nfor the Strengthening Rural Financial Inclusion and Farmer Access to Markets Project in India, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and special funds resources, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n23 October 2014 \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 1966.
